Not long after she died somebody told the police about my dad dealing and his apartment got raided and he was charged with multiple drug offences and for owning two guns that he acquired illegally (I\u2019m from the UK so that\u2019s a big deal). He went to prison for 12 years but only ended up serving 7. Despite having a lot of family, I almost ended up in social care. My dad\u2019s side of the family wanted nothing to do with me, my aunt (mum\u2019s older sister) already had 4 kids and didn\u2019t have the money or space to fit me in, and my grandma on my mum\u2019s side died a year earlier. Eventually my mum\u2019s cousin (we\u2019ll call her Leah) stepped up and went through the rigmarole with the social care system to take me in. She was only 23 at the time, had no kids or partner of her own but she had a lot of money and a nice apartment and lived in an area with good schools, she was also able to pay for child counselling for me so social care deemed her suitable. She didn\u2019t really have any obligation to me since she\u2019d only ever met me twice, but she still stepped up and has raised me ever since (I\u2019m 18 now). Leah is an amazing woman and while she\u2019s never tried to make me see her as a mother. I do consider her that way.\n\nI\u2019m still in touch with my aunt though, I try to have dinner with her and her family every month. This situation happened 2 days ago at the last dinner I had with her. We were talking about my university choices and it got onto the topic of my mum when my aunt mentioned that she\u2019d be so proud of me and asked me if I ever thought about her and if I missed her. Here\u2019s where I might be the asshole, I could\u2019ve just lied and said I did miss her but instead I told my aunt that no, I didn\u2019t and I hardly remember her and the stuff I do remember isn\u2019t good. My aunt said that it didn\u2019t matter and she\u2019d still be proud of me. For some reason I couldn\u2019t drop it and I told her \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t have anything to be proud of, she\u2019s not the one who raised me.\u201d My aunt got really angry at that point and told me that I was being so disrespectful to my mum and that Leah wasn\u2019t my real mum. I told my aunt that I wish Leah was my real mum and I just left and called Leah to ask her to pick me up. \n\nLeah doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole, but she said that I could\u2019ve been nicer to my aunt and kept things to myself since my mum is still a sensitive subject for her and I can understand that. I\u2019m just sick of everyone talking about my mum like she was this angel when she was alive just because she died young.

No. Do I blame you for speaking your true feelings? No. NTA. Your mom might have meant something to your aunt but Leah is the only real mom you've ever known.", "NTA. Yes, maybe you could\u2019ve let it go or worded it differently, but it\u2019s unfair of your aunt to expect you to miss someone who put you in harm\u2019s way consistently. \nOn a separate note, I\u2019m really glad things worked out for you, OP, it sounds like Leah is wonderful, and you have every right to consider her your mother.", "NTA, your aunt shouldn't have asked if she wasn't prepared for an honest answer", "NTA\n\nLeah is your real mother. she did all the hard work of raising you whilst your egg and sperm donors did not. they do not get to claim you as their pride when they did nothing to get you to where you are today.", "NTA,\n\n\nBut lett me tell you something.\nLeah is your real mum. She loves you, she raised you, she had your back when no one else had it.\n\n\nYou biological mother may have birthed you, but for the time you were capable of knowing her/making memories she was in no way shape or form a mother figure.\n\n\nNext time your aunt brings this up you can say this in a nice way. \"I am sorry aunty, but Leah is the one who raised me, who has always been there for me. She is the only mother figure I had, so to me, yeah Leah is my mother. And I get defensive sometimes because you talking about X, like that, feels like you are dismissing everything Leah did for me. We both know X was in a bad place and Leah gave me my first true home. I am grateful to X because she gave birth to me. I am sad she was no longer the beautiful person you remember when I young and did not get to know her the way you did\"", "NTA.  But you know what, Leah is your real mom, not your bio mom but she is the one who loved you, cared for you, raised you and that makes her your mom.\n\nAddiction is too much for some to overcome but your bio mom would still have been proud of you.  I think you might have complex feelings about your bio mom, it might help to get therapy to work those out.", "NTA sometimes when people die people remember what they want to remember. Your aunt probably thinks back to when they were kids and living in the same house being a family. That person wasn\u2019t the same person who started using and stealing and neglecting her child. \n\nUnfortunately, your aunt met a version of your bio mom you never met. So while she can miss that version of her, you don\u2019t and never will. Tough pill to swallow for her. Grating for you to have to be reminded of the bio mom you remember when you grew up with a wonderful mom afterwards. I\u2019m glad you got it off your chest, but they will take some time to understand how you feel - if ever.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re allowed to have and express your feelings, and all this trauma makes your feelings more than understandable.", "Nta \n\nI\u2019d be willing to bet that the aunt wasn\u2019t around when the bad things were happening with your mum and so only remembers her sister as the kid she grew up with. \n\nYou clearly have different memories of her that weren\u2019t so nice. \n\nIf the only person who acted as a mother should was Leah, you\u2019re well within your rights to feel the way you do.", " NTA. When people pass away, the ones left behind often have rose-colored memories of them. You told your aunt your truth. It just wasn\u2019t what she wanted to hear.\n\nBless Leah for stepping up when she didn\u2019t have to. I\u2019m glad things turned out well for you, OP.", "Oh wow.\nNTA but yeh people get sensitive about speaking ill of the dead.\nI'm sure Leah is chuffed you feel that way tho!", "NTA. Of course your Aunt can still feel tender about your bio-Mum, but in expressing that to you, she is disregarding the trauma you suffered at bio-Mums hands. Of course you reacted.\nI\u2019m glad you have Leah.", "NTA. Leah is your real mum. Your birth mother is just that, your birth mother.", "NTA.   You can't change how you feel.  In the future I would avoid the topic and just tell your Aunt that you don't feel comfortable discussing your mother.", "NTA. You're entitled to your feelings and to express them when asked.", "NTA. Maybe not the best thing you could have said in the moment but she asked you gave her an honest answer.", "NTA", "NTA, your aunt isn't entitled to a comfortable lie in my opinion. She has her own memories and views of her sister and that's fine, she should be welcome to them. What she doesn't have is the right to ask you to modify your own memories and feelings. \n\nYou were lucky enough that a great woman stepped in and raised and loved you, your bio mum was not that woman and your aunt shouldn't ask you to pretend like she was!", "I'd say NTA at all in how you feel, but slightly in how you dealt with it and I'm sure Leah is massively proud of you thinking of her as your mum. \nHowever, it does sound like there are still issues that need resolving regarding grief with your family members.", "You are obligated to participate in your aunt's fantasy about the kind of mother her sister would have been.", "Going to say NTA for wanting Leah to have been your mom, as obviously that's a tough and tragic situation from your mom's addiction. It's great she was able to step in and help raise you.\n\nYou were very much being an AH to your aunt though. She had her own kids and financial responsibilities that she HAD to take care of. That's life, and she's no more responsible for your mom's addiction or behavior than you were.\n\nThrowing that back at her was rude, considering that she was also remembering her sister. Not all of her life was negated either by the addiction, and they obviously shared a life and memories before you were born. Try and keep that in perspective.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
