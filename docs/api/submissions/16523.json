Why are you being so cheap? You guys are dating, and you\u2019re making a huge deal out of a couple slices of pizza. If you\u2019re this cheap with your BF I\u2019d hate to see how you are with other people", " YTA. It was 3 slices. Who cares. Jesus.", "YTA\n\nSo there's just no grace in this relationship? Sounds exhausting", "ESH. You both are not ready to live together.", "ESH: he should have asked if he wanted some as you did pay for it. But seeing as you live with each other and buy lots of stuff together, I think a fairer solution would be if he gave you some of his pizza/whatever take away he gets next time.", "Oh my, are you in a relationship or are you in a business transaction\u2026 nickel and dining everything like this is just silly to me..", "INFO: Are you struggling financially?", "ESH - He's basically your roommate that you sleep with, and roommates shouldn't steal your food.  So he was in the wrong for eating it without asking.  You're not in the clear because you said you asked him to pay for half when he didn't eat half.  If you're going to be that transactional in your relationship you need to be honest and calculate cost by the percentage he ate.  However, you could have at least given him a warning that leftovers are not community property and if he did it again he'd be expected to pay.\n\nBut be honest, none of this sounds like how you'd treat someone you love.", "ESH.  Him for not asking if it was OK to eat the rest of the pizza. You for making your partner pay for what he ate. Very nit picky", "YTA. I'd understand if he ate the food you specifically prepared for yourself, but he ate the leftovers you didn't even need since the portion was too big for you alone. It's *three pizza slices;* get a grip. It's not a big deal. I understand splitting the costs, but not to the point of tracking down every single thing he uses and counting the pennies. Stinginess is a very unattractive trait.", "YTA - and hear me out because technically in an exchange of goods, you are in the right. But you're in a partnership, right? Partnership isn't going to be exactly fair or exactly 50/50 all the time. I'm not saying we allow for long-term lopsidedness in fairness, but we're talking about a few slices of pizza. If this is a problem for your partner to eat some of your pizza, outline the expectations in the future. What's fair to you is important! However, if the expectations weren't there prior, the partnership you have needs to be taken into account. If he didn't know what you wanted, have some grace, make an agreement going forward, and continue in love and care for one another. Learn from it. But it's a few dollars, right? There will be an opportunity in the future for him to take care of you a little bit, too. That's the beauty of partnership. We look out for and take care of one another. Let it be a learning moment and an opportunity to love him.", "Hmm tough call.  I can understand you being mad esp when you didn't tell him he could have rest.. but making him pay for half forcsomething u mostly ate but 3 slices that little extreme. I gonna have to say slight yta", "YTA I understand you pay for your own food but it was leftovers. Relationships shouldn't be this transactional.", "Yta.  \n\nYou live together. You buy all your food together. You put the pizza in a fridge that you share. You didn't bother telling him that it's your pizza and only for you.   \n\nSo he ate it.  \n\nGrow up and move on.", "YTA just let it go.", "INFO: is it normal (even only on occasion) for you to get dinner and sometimes give him some when he gets home? Might have just assumed you saved the extra for him.\n\nIf not, then NTA", "INFO - who paid for the pizza, and do you normally make dinner and save him some when he works late?", "NTA you guys agreed to set rules about expenses and food was part of that. Condiments are an expected share item, leftover food is not.", "NTA\n\nYour deal was: \n\n>if we buy anything that's meant to be used/ consumed by the two of us then we also split the cost.\n\nThe pizza wasn't meant to be eaten by both of you.\n\nThis isn't, like some commenters are saying, about your being \"cheap\" or, \"it's only 3 slices.\" This is about YOUR food being gone. Not cool.\n\nBUT I will say you've only lived together for 30 days. You can work the kinks out. \n\n- You can make a rule that neither of you can eat the other's \"solo\" food without asking. Can't reach the other to ask? Too bad. Open a can of darn soup. Just as easy. \n\n- You can also label foods. Then, you have his food, your food, communal food. \n\n- You could do bins. His snacks, cheeses, dips, his leftovers, whatever. Same for you. (Or you could each have a shelf.) \n\nThere are ways to work through this. It wasn't kind that he ate your food though.", "NTA\n\nHe could've asked, but he chose zo ask for forgiveness and not for permission. The small things indicate larger problems. If he really didn't mean to he wouldn't have attacked you", "ESH\n\nHe shouldn't have eaten your leftovers. \n\nYou shouldn't have immediately asked for money back. You could have asked him to order you takeout to pay you back or something. \n\nAlso you said \"regular sized\" pizza that you ate most of...why would he need to pay back half if he didn't even eat half of it.", "ESH. Eating ALL of your leftovers, without asking, sucks. But making him pay actual money for it is excessive. Just sit down with him and have a conversation about expectations for sharing leftovers.", "Not the AH for expecting accountability for his actions - although insisting on payment probably wasn\u2019t the best way to handle this. I\u2019ll say NTA because it was a dick move to eat your pizza without asking.", "I think NTA because it sounds like you two have very divided and mutually agreed finance system between you two, but I\u2019d add that it does sound difficult if you\u2019re living together.", "Watch out when a selfish person calls you selfish. That's not good.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThere's 2 kinds of people. Those who want everything to be equal, and those who want everything to be roughly equal. You're going to have a hard time living with someone from the other group. I know cos I'm like you and my partner is like your BF. It can be very frustrating, but at the end of the day, you have to remember you're not right, just different. Both ways can work.\n\nI suggest you sit down and try to set out a middle-ground you're both happy with. You try not to get upset over a few dollars, and he tries to remember that feeling like you're being taken advantage of sucks.", "Um, next time just ask him to ask before he eats it. Expecting payment is so absurd specially since it only happened once. It\u2019s very hard to maintain 50/50 in Relationships.", "Ffs, he had 3 pieces of your pizza, big deal. Who the heck gets so precious about 3 pieces of pizza. Yeah it\u2019s annoying, but telling him u want half the payment is petty and small minded. \n\nYou must be awful to live with, grow up.\n\nYeah YTA", "YTA and petty AF", "\"bought\" not \"brought\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Were you technically in the right based on how you describe your separation of funds? Sure. That doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t an asshole move. It would have been nice of your partner to ask you if it was alright to eat the pizza, but it sounds exhausting to be in a relationship that requires a ledger. Unless this is an ongoing issue of them eating food you bought for yourself, it seems over the top. You\u2019re supposed to be a team, right? It\u2019s just 3 slices of pizza.", "You gonna die on that hill? Nickel and diming each other sounds so unpleasant but you do you. He should have asked, you shouldn\u2019t nickel and dime.

Honey, there's a term you're going to learn when you get deep into relationships, and maybe you'll learn it even more when you have children. It's called \"pick your battles\" because if you're going to start some shit with him over a couple slices of pizza then baby, you're in for a wild ride of aggravation, frustration, and pain for the rest of your life with every single person you will ever meet.", "No", "He probably arrived home when OP was sleeping and was starving. They are in a committed relationship not flatmates, it\u2019s okay to share food occasionally!!", "How do you know she didn\u2019t need the left overs? Leftovers are kept for the purpose of eating at a later time. Otherwise she would have just thrown them out.", "I used to be more like OP, and my GF had a habit of buying dinner for me once in a while or getting me a snack if she was getting something for herself. I appreciated it, but I saw it as her decision and didn't take on a sense of obligation about it since I was always really careful with my money.\n\nShe pointed out the imbalance, and I explained where I was coming from, but somehow she got through to me with this perspective you're sharing here. I started being more generous with her and my friends, and the generosity has always been returned close enough to not be an issue. It definitely feels like it made a significant positive difference in my life.\n\nI met a couple a few years ago who was much more exact in their sense of obligation, and when I paid more than they did in some shared takeout they were anxious to take care of the debt, literally counting out pennies to get even. It felt like we weren't friends.", "Sometimes I prepare extra food for him.", "I paid for it, sometimes I make dinner for him too.", "Don't make mountains out of mole hills. Does he treat you right? Does he asked to be paid back for every little thing? Be kind, be generous, and lead with an open heart. \n\nYou live together as long as he doesn't take advantage be reasonable.", "I don\u2019t understand all the Y T As. I\u2019ve lived with my BF for five years now. We split everything including groceries. However, if he bought pizza and I wasn\u2019t involved in the meal, I would ask before eating any of it. It\u2019s common courtesy to ask before eating someone else\u2019s food. Heck, even items purchased collectively with the intent for the thing being for only one of us is given the courtesy of an ask before the other takes any of it. The answer is always \u201cof course you can\u201d, but it\u2019s a matter of respect for each other. \n\nI know that when he buys pizza without me, he\u2019s likely planning on eating the leftovers for another meal. If I end up eating it for a meal, the receipt goes into the shared expenses pile that we balance out every few months (formerly monthly). Money is money. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s $5 or $50. It\u2019s a matter of principle. \n\nNTA He should have asked. Not asking means you have the choice to determine if the cost should become a split cost or if you want to shrug it off.", "Exactly. Your working as a team. He probably came home late, was starving and ate the pizza without thinking. I understand the frustration but when I get food I want to share with my partner. Sharing and giving is necessary in a relationship.", "ESH, you both sound kind of miserable to be in a relationship with \u2014 you\u2019re live-in partners! You\u2019re not supposed to be nickel-and-diming each other with literally everything that either of you purchase. That\u2019s so exhausting and, imo, doesn\u2019t promote a team environment \u2014 and when you\u2019re in a long-term relationship, you should be a team.", "Technically still NTA but come on its just 3 slices of pizza.", "I agree. I like sharing my food with my boyfriend. Sure if I\u2019m fantasizing about those last couple slices of pizza all day and come home to them eaten I\u2019m going to be like wtf?
