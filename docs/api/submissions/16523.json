So he was in the wrong for eating it without asking.  You're not in the clear because you said you asked him to pay for half when he didn't eat half.  If you're going to be that transactional in your relationship you need to be honest and calculate cost by the percentage he ate.  However, you could have at least given him a warning that leftovers are not community property and if he did it again he'd be expected to pay.\n\nBut be honest, none of this sounds like how you'd treat someone you love.", "ESH.  Him for not asking if it was OK to eat the rest of the pizza. You for making your partner pay for what he ate. Very nit picky", "YTA. I'd understand if he ate the food you specifically prepared for yourself, but he ate the leftovers you didn't even need since the portion was too big for you alone. It's *three pizza slices;* get a grip. It's not a big deal. I understand splitting the costs, but not to the point of tracking down every single thing he uses and counting the pennies. Stinginess is a very unattractive trait.", "YTA - and hear me out because technically in an exchange of goods, you are in the right. But you're in a partnership, right? Partnership isn't going to be exactly fair or exactly 50/50 all the time. I'm not saying we allow for long-term lopsidedness in fairness, but we're talking about a few slices of pizza. If this is a problem for your partner to eat some of your pizza, outline the expectations in the future. What's fair to you is important! However, if the expectations weren't there prior, the partnership you have needs to be taken into account. If he didn't know what you wanted, have some grace, make an agreement going forward, and continue in love and care for one another. Learn from it. But it's a few dollars, right? There will be an opportunity in the future for him to take care of you a little bit, too. That's the beauty of partnership. We look out for and take care of one another. Let it be a learning moment and an opportunity to love him.", "Hmm tough call.

He probably didn\u2019t even think about it. I wouldn\u2019t have. If I eat something of my bf\u2019s he doesn\u2019t yell at me to pay him pack, I just buy him another meal another day. I understand the point behind the fight, but if this is the biggest financial issue they have, they\u2019re fine. It honestly sounds more petty than anything. She\u2019s asking out of frustration. That\u2019s understandable. But it\u2019s 3 slices of pizza. Not a major expense. Maybe next time she can text him and say \u201chey. I have pizza in the fridge I\u2019m saving for later, please don\u2019t eat it.\u201d If anything, he could\u2019ve thought she saved them for him, or just saved them so she didn\u2019t throw them out. I do it all the time with food and more often than not it just goes bad in the fridge and I end up throwing it out anyway. So if my bf ends up eating them, it\u2019s not a big deal. This would warrant a \u201chey this was mine and you shouldn\u2019t have eaten it\u201d conversation and not a \u201cyou need to pay me for 3 slices\u201d conversation. Especially when that would be what, $5? Not even enough for another one. It\u2019s not about money it\u2019s about being petty. If she were worried about him taking advantage of her financially the issue wouldn\u2019t have been over 3 slices in one instance but bigger issues in multiple instances.", "Omg, with this attitude, you are destined to be forever alone.

Most of a pizza can't be half of a pizza.", "This is still a conversation of hey, please don\u2019t eat my leftovers I take those for lunch/have them for dinner the next day, etc. Not you owe me for 3-5 dollars worth of pizza. That\u2019s insanity, you should be happy to share a bit with your partner in general, it\u2019s only when it becomes a totally one sided sharing situation that there\u2019s an issue.\n\nWas it a bit rude to ask without asking? Yes. But the response should be a joking, you ate my lunch ya dick, next pizza is on you. Not like I need 3.75 right now to make up for the monetary loss.", "That's not sharing though, it's straight up just nicking it. \n\nWhat if OP had wanted to take the leftovers to work for lunch the following day and now has to pay AGAIN? That's just rude.", "It's is but that's not what they agreed upon. \n\nWhat if the post had been from BF perspective? \n\n\"Me and my GF split everything perfectly evenly and only eat shared food if we both paid for it. \n\nLast night I came home super hungry and decided to eat some pizza she had bought. I know I didn't help pay but I just wanted something quick and easy instead of cooking. \n\nThis morning she woke up upset that the pizza had been eaten. I told her it was no big deal, but now she's saying I need to pay her back. AITA if I don't pay her back?\" \n\nBecause this set up is what the agreed on - BF should have done one of the following:\n\n1. Asked before eating the pizza. \n2. Apologized after eating it and offer to make ammeneds \"Next meal is on me\" \n3. Not eaten the pizza and just eat something else in the cabinet. \n\nI think there's missing context here as we don't know who originally wanted things to be split so evenly. \n\nFor example if BF was super strict about wanting everything to be even but then decides to break the rule when he feels like it: he's the asshole. \n\nIf OP wanted it but BF just doesnt really agree with it: it seems to be they are not compatible. And OP might want to evaluate why they are so hellbent on everything being perfectly even. \n\nIf they both wanted it evenly and the BF just decided to give up on it last night for whatever reason- they should have talked it through instead of OP jumping to demanding they be paid back. Maybe it was an opportunity to reevaluate their agreement instead of immediately going on the offense, in which case OP is the asshole for just not having a mature conversation about it. \n\nThe people who are saying \"It's just 3 slices of pizza\" are probably missing the bigger picture that I bet the post isn't really addressing.", "I mean what if she only gets to order takeout/pizza on rare occasions and was genuinely excited for it? \u201c3 measly slices\u201d is usually 3/8ths of the pizza, so almost half. If he had wanted to be a good partner but was hungry, he could have had one or two - why take her entire treat??? Seems selfish to me. \n\nShe probably shouldn\u2019t have demanded money, that\u2019s a bit much,  but this is distinctly ESH", "No, you paid for it, your are expecting it, and it just takes a simple question to clarify if it's ok.  When it comes down to it the majority of people are shitty roomates. There are more dynamics at play when you are romantically involved but the same basic considerations should apply. I would never eat another person's leftovers without asking first, but I have had roommates do that and more. \n\nHomeboy should have asked, but it doesn't suprise me that so many people are trying to further justify his behavior just because they are dating.\n\nAlso, it's 3 slices. That's a meal right there. That could have been her lunch. \n\nNTA.", "Exactly! Like the getting upset part is not where she is TA. It\u2019s a natural reaction. But the asking for payment for 3 slices of pizza? That\u2019s crazy. And I bet you, this whole splitting everything was her idea. Like yes, in my house it\u2019s not 50/50 because my boyfriend makes 3x the income I do. HE agreed it would not be smart to have me give half. So I pay for daycare, 1 of the household utility bills, groceries and then my personal bills. I don\u2019t say \u201cwell since I pay for all the groceries, you can starve.\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "If OP and her BF are so anal about splitting costs evenly, 25% difference is likely significant", "Yes! Especially if that\u2019s the first time something like that happened.

Splitting rent, utilities etc and paying for your own \u201cnice to have\u201d items makes a ton of sense. No way they should be merging finances at this stage", "Obviously he didn't taje that as seriousky as OP though", "Didn\u2019t she already sleep tho?", "I don\u2019t think either of them are ready for a living together relationship.  And I agree with what you are saying.  But they set the boundaries, and if he is splitting dinner bills with her, then it should always apply or they need to renegotiate their financial terms.  It\u2019s really difficult when you are not married to mix finances. And is not a financially responsible thing to do, unless you have some clear boundaries and contracts that protect both individuals financially.  It\u2019s pizza, personally I would not have cared, but it does start to add up. And if he is not longer \u201cdating\u201d her, by taking her out and paying for the bill, that could factor into how and why she is holding the line on the boundaries they agreed to.", "It\u2019s not about the pizza, it\u2019s about boundaries, boundaries that they set and agreed to together.  If since moving in together, they are splitting the costs of all shared meals, then that means he isn\u2019t really dating her since moving in together.  And statistically speaking, men earn more than women. So what exactly is in it for her? She has to pay Dutch for dates with him, split expenses and they are not married, or engaged, nor do they have co-mingled assets, and he doesn\u2019t respect boundaries that he agreed to.

He\u2019ll even text me at 3am to see if I\u2019m up and want something if he decides to go get food when he comes back from hanging with his friends. And if I\u2019m not up he usually brings me something anyways and puts in in the fridge for me. It\u2019s things like this that make me less upset if he drinks my sodas or leftovers I was saving. Because I know he didn\u2019t mean any harm by it, and he takes the time to do things for  me all the time. Their relationship seems so transactional.

If it's something I really want to eat later, I might tell him, \"I'm gonna have that for lunch tomorrow.\" Otherwise, it's fair game. Because we live together and share a life, so we share food.

If I\u2019d saved three slices for lunch the next day and found them gone I\u2019d be pissed.", "I mean if she really wants to bring the receipts then I think the devaluation of overnight pizza should also be calculated here.", "He thought she was joking, so these rules/boundaries aren\u2019t as clear as you think they are. Also they are peak stupidity. This is a relationship, not a partnership. Anyone setting up rules this specific and silo\u2019d, is setting each other up for failure.", "It's three fucking slices of pizza. Get a grip! You're trying to make it a gender issue lmao", ">Guarantee he would not have done that with a roommate\n\nWell, yeah... because roommates are a completely different kind of relationship.  They're supposed to be partners.", "My husband and I have been together for near on 10 years. We share nearly everything but if we buy something for ourselves we always ask the other before taking. At the very least if we did eat it we would offer to cover the next time around /share", "I mean you cool with me just stealing 10 bucks from you too?", "You are a wise person.", "100% this comment. Life is literally too short to be worrying about 3 slices of pizza. If you worried about the money then think of it like this, in the long run this will cost you more in time and energy to pursue. If you are upset based on principle (which I can understand) you've got to just learn to let some things go. The world is not perfect and while it would be predictable if everything and everyone behaved in the expected manner, that's just not life. I don't think you're the asshole here because it does suck when you have food in the fridge expecting to have it for a meal and it's suddenly gone but I wouldn't dwell on it.\n\nAlso, just as a word of advice; you're living with this person so I would expect that some degree of sharing is going to happen. There is literally no way a sane couple could split everything 50/50. When you buy ketchup do you only eat exactly half of the bottle?", "I mean she\u2019s not asking for food to be split by cost in proportion to how much they eat, she\u2019s asking for food she completely pays for to be hers only. She already said they split common/shared things together. You\u2019re telling me you wouldn\u2019t be annoyed if you went out to eat, came home with leftovers, and your partner eats them without asking? She asked for reimbursement bc she was clearly annoyed with the entitlement. He didn\u2019t even ask. What if she was saving that for an easy lunch? Or if there wasn\u2019t anything else left in the fridge? He put his needs before hers with something that wasn\u2019t even his and then gets upset when she asks him to pay for it. He could\u2019ve gotten his own food.", "\"pain and suffering\"\n\nThis made me chuckle so much. \ud83e\udd23", "\"Hey buddy I'm gonna eat that pizza in the fridge for lunch 3 days from now, so keep your filthy claws off it\".\n\nProblem solved!", "The end of your comment nails it. If every exchange has this incredibly detailed transactionality to them, you start questioning it the relationship itself is also merely transactional.", ">I met a couple a few years ago who was much more exact in their sense of obligation, and when I paid more than they did in some shared takeout they were anxious to take care of the debt, literally counting out pennies to get even. It felt like we weren't friends.\n\nMy brother is like that, and I feel this SO MUCH. I'm like bro it's $3-4 for some coffee or gas, relax... I am 28 years old with a stable career, I quite literally will not even notice if that three dollars is in my account or not. It will make ZERO difference whatsoever in my life. \nPeople (myself included) have told him over and over and over that we don't care about a few dollars and that it just makes it more uncomfortable than anything. But he CANNOT accept people spending money on him without \"repaying the debt\", no matter how small. If you refuse to let him, he'll fkn remember and find a way to make it even later. It's just like cmon man, you're my brother, of course I don't give a shit about the $3 of gas or coffee or whatever! I'd spend that on a coworker I barely know, without batting an eye or ever expecting anything in return! \n\nI really don't like when people are so intensely transactional like that. \nI do understand where my brother is coming from - we grew up in an extremely financially insecure household, and he personally has never been super financially secure so far in his life either (as is the case for many 25yr olds). \nBut if you're uncomfortable with someone spending a couple bucks on you... Don't handle that by being like \"OMG I OWE YOU TWO DOLLARS AND FOURTEEN CENTS RIGHT NOW, LET ME REPAY YOU\". Just say thank you, and quietly take note of it/remember that \"oh yea, they gave me a coffee/ride a while back, I should treat them to one this time\" when an opportunity comes up someday. That's all. It doesn't have to be this explicitly transactional thing. It could still be transactional inside your head if youre extremely financially insecure, but the socially correct thing to do is to NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT and just quietly \"repay\" the favour some other time. That way it's still even and balanced, but WAAAAY LESSSSS awkward and uncomfortable. It doesn't create this dynamic of owing eachother a couple dollars for tiny insignificant things... It just creates this unspoken, \"sometimes I'll get things for you, sometimes you'll get things for me, and we can just assume it balances out without counting down to the penny\" and that's just so much nicer for everyone involved.", "Nice to see that you feel like it made a significant positive difference in your life!", "Yep.  This is sage advice.  I would want out fast.", "i use 50$ in  your present i hope mine is 50$ too imagine this type of people ahah", "Everyone's different. Some people get married after dating a year. My husband and I were living together and splitting everything after dating 6 months lol. That said, no matter how long you've been dating you have to be ready to share finances and this couple ain't.", "Just had to dump off a couple friends over this. I never had an issue with paying for anything and I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019d rather have a good time than everyone worrying about money. \n\nWell these friends weren\u2019t the same. They always wanted a Venmo or cashapp anytime they paid for anything. It\u2019s like man, I\u2019ve paid wayyyy more in this friendship  just got to feel way too one sided.", "I'm currently sitting at the back of my son's school waiting for play rehearsal to end and literally lol'd at this LMAO. I just gave everyone a finger wave when they all turned around \ud83e\udd23", "The responses are to the question. \n\n>\"AITA for asking my boyfriend to pay me back after he ate my food?\"\n\nMost seem to agree with her being upset that her pizza was eaten and agree that she has the right to request him to not do it again without asking. \n\nThe responses are specific to her asking for payment in this situation that is the asshole move.\n\nAlso, \"[furious](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/furious)\"? Really?", "I don't know, I really get where she is coming from, especially if this is something that bothers her and she wants to address if up front.\n\nI didn't and now I'm pretty miserable when it comes to food in the house. My GF works from home and whenever she cooks, she eats the leftovers for lunch and dinner before I even get home. Whenever I cook, she eats the leftovers for lunch and dinner before I ger home. Same with take-out - if she buys it she eats the leftovers, and if I buy it, she eats the leftovers. She'll get takeout for herself while I am gone but get nothing for me since I'm away, but it's rude if I bring home takeout and not get something for her since she's home.\n\nEven if I specifically ask for her not to eat something, she'll \"just have a lunch portion\" and let me have the dinner leftovers instead of being able to enjoy something over multiple meals. \n\nIt's a big deal when you are on different budgets and in the same household and one person is trying to make a meal stretch multiple days and the other just eats it like its expected.", "Hey, some people really have their hills to die on. I have certain things I am particular about and I expect a partner to respect those things. \n\nThis situation is so fucking far from that though lol.", "Oh for sure! When I was with my ex especially if I knew he\u2019d had a hard day I\u2019d leave him dinner he could just heat up or have door dash timed to when he got home to show up. It\u2019s just food! Using the last of something important like tampon? Yeah I could see that pissing me off but it\u2019s just pizza, order more.\n\nEdited for misspelling", "His fav cake was German choc. One day I told him there was marble cake with white icing he could help himself to and I actually had made his German cake. It made me feel so good to see the smile on his face when he lifted the lid after working out in the heat for 12hrs that day. I say a fed man is a happy mad why ruin that lol", "Then OP needs to have a conversation about it, not assume he's going to know. Especially when she's left him leftovers before. OP did not say this has happened before, or that she told him not to eat the pizza. In several comments she said he has shared his food with her without expecting to be paid back, and that she's left him food before. From what OP has said, this seems like the first time it's happened.\n\nBut I am so sorry for your situation, *that* sounds brutal. I work 12 hour shifts and always bring leftovers, I'd be angry if my fiancee consistently took them all without asking me, especially if I asked her not to. Thankfully we respect each other enough not to do that", "Omg do we have the same dad! The midnight sweet eater struck often at my house too! Nothing was ever safe, unless hidden exceptionally well. I once caught him asleep in the armchair in the living room, with an entire gallon of melted ice cream in his lap. He sat down for his midnight sugar kick, accidentally fell asleep and the whole thing melted. I found him snoring and covered in ice cream\u2026. 22 years later and I\u2019ve still never let him live it down \ud83d\ude02", "I have a friend. Who when it came time to share costs of a bachelorette party, calculated the cost of each item down to how much gas it would take to get to whatever store. \u201cI can go to Kroger and get it for $5.00 and it\u2019s 3 miles away, so gas will be X and the item cost is therefore Y. Or I can go to Target & get it for $6.00 and it\u2019s 2.5 miles away, so gas will be X which means the item actually costs Y.\u201d", "I'd agree with you 100% if OP and her partner didn't have a history and understanding that each person pays for themselves. If my partner expected me to pay for a few slices of leftover pizza, I'd think she's being unreasonable because we have a system of \"it'll come out in the wash\" where if she pays for dinner one night, I pay the next time. \n\nI think that the way they handle finances between them will likely cause more stress as it did here and strain the relationship. However, I can't call anyone TA because this is their established system.", "My partner and I have been together over a decade. We share a ton of stuff with each other. But not leftovers. Never.", "Everyone's different. That worked out great for me.", "I completely agree. I came to say something like this and was surprised when I saw all the replies saying that she was the one in the wrong. I would've agreed with them until I saw the last paragraph about how they already had a set agreement over how to share expenses. He violated that agreement and there should be consequences for that decision.", "I agree; it seems like OP should have just let this one go. Explain how they feel, and then set a boundary to keep it from happening again. In my relationship, we share some food, and some, we keep for ourselves. For instance, I love ice cream. My bf asks if he can have some before eating any of my ice cream. He loves fruit juice. If I want a glass of juice that he bought, I ask. We have taken the time to clearly communicate these things. It seems like OP should have a talk with bf about expectations, bc clearly they are not on the same page. I like the idea of leaving a note that says \"please don't eat\" or something to that effect, if there's something you want to save.", "The have such a system. If you didn\u2019t buy, you can\u2019t eat it. He didn\u2019t buy the pizza yet he ate the pizza knowing full well that it wasn\u2019t his. If he wanted to share food, he should have agreed to sharing the cost of all groceries instead of this weird arrangement. But he didn\u2019t. He agree to buy his own and for her to buy her own then he ate hers without even asking. Bet he throws a hissy fit if she eats his food.", "Honestly, it's just \"next pizza's on you.\" If you're so hard up you need to be reimbursed by your partner for 3 slices, you shouldn't be getting take out.", "Here i was reading it like eeesh or sheesh lol", "To be honest, if it was really about food I could maybe understand, because I'm a binge-eater and I know that when I'm craving food I can be very unreasonable. But this seems to be more about the money than about the food, about her not wanting to share. That's what gets me, the individualism.", "Nooooo wayyyyyyy cold pizza should def be priced at a premium", "I feel like nobody in this thread has had people renege on agreements or eat food they were expecting to be able to eat before. \n\nLike, is their agreement weird? Yes, absolutely it's bizarre as hell. But they *both* agreed to splitting costs this way in advance before moving in, and they've only been living together a month and he's already disregarding the agreement and arguing with her about whether or not he should be expected to adhere to it. It's not like he asked if he could have it, she said yes and then after the fact she sprung on him that she expected him to pay. He ate it without asking knowing full well what the agreement was *and* that he hadn't paid for part of the pizza and then got mad when she expected him to follow through on his part of their agreement. *He* is the one trampling on newly set boundaries he agreed to without any prior communication and bitching about being held to those mutually agreed upon boundaries, but she's the asshole for requesting he follow through on the agreement?\n\nNot to mention, there is nothing shittier than having leftovers that you have specific plans for and then them disappearing without warning. 3 slices of pizza can be three work lunches for me when paired with a piece of fruit and carrots or something - that's over half a work week of planned lunches eaten in a single evening with zero communication. \n\nIf someone unceremoniously inconvenienced me, ignored the boundaries and rules we had *just* mutually set, and then complained when I got frustrated/tried to enforce those mutually agreed upon boundaries, I'd be annoyed as hell too.", "I know, right??? When I'm visiting family we all kind of trade off paying for things or cooking or buying groceries and none of us keep track of who owes what because there's always another meal to share. BUT! If we went out to a restaurant and each have an individual meal, you don't eat the other person's leftovers. Like, I made the decision of how much of my giant burrito to eat on the assumption that I'd get to revisit it later. Marinating the stump is the best part!", "there\u2019s a show, i think it\u2019s called extreme cheapskates, but there\u2019s an episode where a husband and wife literally count flushes & whoever has more by the time the bill is due pay\u2019s the bill. like\u2026they weren\u2019t even financially struggling. i think they said they had quite a bit of money actually", "My aunts like that. Dead serious she whipped out a calculator to calculate the portion we owed her for the pizza. We ordered once", "I had a \u201cfriend\u201d Venmo request me for $2 because I asked if I could have her one leftover taco and she agreed. She then proceeded to get sick and I stayed up basically all night taking care of her (and cleaning up her puke), even though I had to work early the next morning. Few days later I got the Venmo request and I was LIVID. Ended the friendship"]}
