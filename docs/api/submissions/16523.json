So he was in the wrong for eating it without asking.  You're not in the clear because you said you asked him to pay for half when he didn't eat half.  If you're going to be that transactional in your relationship you need to be honest and calculate cost by the percentage he ate.  However, you could have at least given him a warning that leftovers are not community property and if he did it again he'd be expected to pay.\n\nBut be honest, none of this sounds like how you'd treat someone you love.", "ESH.  Him for not asking if it was OK to eat the rest of the pizza. You for making your partner pay for what he ate. Very nit picky", "YTA. I'd understand if he ate the food you specifically prepared for yourself, but he ate the leftovers you didn't even need since the portion was too big for you alone. It's *three pizza slices;* get a grip. It's not a big deal. I understand splitting the costs, but not to the point of tracking down every single thing he uses and counting the pennies. Stinginess is a very unattractive trait.", "YTA - and hear me out because technically in an exchange of goods, you are in the right. But you're in a partnership, right? Partnership isn't going to be exactly fair or exactly 50/50 all the time. I'm not saying we allow for long-term lopsidedness in fairness, but we're talking about a few slices of pizza. If this is a problem for your partner to eat some of your pizza, outline the expectations in the future. What's fair to you is important! However, if the expectations weren't there prior, the partnership you have needs to be taken into account. If he didn't know what you wanted, have some grace, make an agreement going forward, and continue in love and care for one another. Learn from it. But it's a few dollars, right? There will be an opportunity in the future for him to take care of you a little bit, too. That's the beauty of partnership. We look out for and take care of one another. Let it be a learning moment and an opportunity to love him.", "Hmm tough call.  I can understand you being mad esp when you didn't tell him he could have rest.. but making him pay for half forcsomething u mostly ate but 3 slices that little extreme.
