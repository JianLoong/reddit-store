It wasn't expected. He wasn't sick. He walked out the door one morning to go to work and never came back home. My mom was reeling after it and ended up not being the best mom to me at the time. My paternal grandparents were there for us both but especially for me. When I was 8 my grandma died. Grandpa was my rock through everything. The day I found out grandma had died, I found out mom had started dating someone and she wanted me to meet him. When mom married that man, my now stepdad John, a year later, grandpa was really my only confidant. It made me sad that mom had moved on. Made me afraid that they would expect me to think of John as my new dad. I remember hating that he was already calling me his kid. Grandpa made it better and assured me dad would have wanted us all to be happy. But he said being happy didn't mean John had to be anything more than my stepdad.\n\nEven after John married my mom, I still considered grandpa as the primary male figure/father figure in my life. It was grandpa I went to over John. I grew to like John. But he was never my dad. He is the father to my younger half siblings. It was when they started coming along (I was 11 when mom had her next child) that my grandpa became public enemy number one in mom and John's eyes. He didn't step in and act as a grandfather to them and he didn't go out of his way to be in their family. He was kind when he saw them and chatted like ever. But they weren't his adoptive/surrogate grandkids in any way which mom and John found unfair.\n\nThis is why now, 20 years after losing my dad and now that I am getting married, I decided to sit mom and John down and tell them my grandpa would be acting as FOTB in my wedding. It surprised both of them. They wanted to know why not John. John said he was the one who raised me through my preteen and teenage years, he was the one who would have adopted me in a heartbeat if I had been at all receptive to the idea, and he was the one who technically filled a father role for me. I said that it was never him I looked at as my father figure after dad died and grandpa had been there for me and supported me more than any other person, through the worst moments of my life.\n\nThey believe my telling them was rubbing this into their faces. Mom said I should have said nothing. They both believe I asked the wrong person and should change my mind.

My stepdad has wanted to be so much more to me and to add to that there is bad blood on their part with my grandpa. I question if I am doing something that is making everything worse.
