It wasn't expected. He wasn't sick. He walked out the door one morning to go to work and never came back home. My mom was reeling after it and ended up not being the best mom to me at the time. My paternal grandparents were there for us both but especially for me. When I was 8 my grandma died. Grandpa was my rock through everything. The day I found out grandma had died, I found out mom had started dating someone and she wanted me to meet him. When mom married that man, my now stepdad John, a year later, grandpa was really my only confidant. It made me sad that mom had moved on. Made me afraid that they would expect me to think of John as my new dad. I remember hating that he was already calling me his kid. Grandpa made it better and assured me dad would have wanted us all to be happy. But he said being happy didn't mean John had to be anything more than my stepdad.\n\nEven after John married my mom, I still considered grandpa as the primary male figure/father figure in my life. It was grandpa I went to over John. I grew to like John. But he was never my dad. He is the father to my younger half siblings. It was when they started coming along (I was 11 when mom had her next child) that my grandpa became public enemy number one in mom and John's eyes. He didn't step in and act as a grandfather to them and he didn't go out of his way to be in their family. He was kind when he saw them and chatted like ever. But they weren't his adoptive/surrogate grandkids in any way which mom and John found unfair.\n\nThis is why now, 20 years after losing my dad and now that I am getting married, I decided to sit mom and John down and tell them my grandpa would be acting as FOTB in my wedding. It surprised both of them. They wanted to know why not John. John said he was the one who raised me through my preteen and teenage years, he was the one who would have adopted me in a heartbeat if I had been at all receptive to the idea, and he was the one who technically filled a father role for me. I said that it was never him I looked at as my father figure after dad died and grandpa had been there for me and supported me more than any other person, through the worst moments of my life.\n\nThey believe my telling them was rubbing this into their faces. Mom said I should have said nothing. They both believe I asked the wrong person and should change my mind.

I also told them it would happen because he's been there for me more than anyone else. But when I told them all this, I knew they would want my stepdad to be father of the bride. I knew it wouldn't be something they would like. I wonder if I was a little insensitive telling them and then driving the reason why home to them. My stepdad has wanted to be so much more to me and to add to that there is bad blood on their part with my grandpa. I question if I am doing something that is making everything worse.

You've confided in your grandpa as you would your dad if he were still here. Not to mention, your grandpa is an extention of your dad, so it's like he's with you as your grandpa fills the role of FOTB.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, your choice. There\u2019s a lot of \u201ctraditional hooplah\u201d when it comes to weddings. Do whatever makes you happy because it is your day, not theirs.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need to justify it. You are close with your grandpa. It's your wedding. If that's the biggest time model in your life, then it's natural you want him to be in that role.", "NTA.   \nYou sound like you\u2019ve explained yourself kindly and fairly. You can\u2019t change how your heart feels, and it feels like you want your grandfather to walk you down the aisle.   \nWeddings these days can take a little tradition and a lot of creativity - the \u2018traditional wedding\u2019 was rarely as traditional as people like to think even in the past. When you sit down with your parent\u2018s generation you find out they all \u2018broke the rules\u2019 too\u2026 so go ahead and do it yourself, and have your wedding celebrate your grandfather\u2019s relationship. Offer up a consolation gig for your step dad if necessary.", "**NTA** \\- It is your wedding; you get to choose who walks you down the aisle.  And of course, you had to tell your mom and stepdad.   It sounds like you handled it with dignity for all.  When they pressed you for an explanation, you told them the truth.  I don't think that you asked the wrong person.", "NTA. My stepfather never tried to be my new dad even though I call him dad bc i got used to it.\nBut I dont think your grandpa is the wrong to ask.\nMaybe he doesnt like Johns offspring but I'm sure he likes you and I think he would be the best FOTB you can get.\nBetween being a father and raising someone can be worlds so I dont think John is a good candidate.", "NTA, it\u2019s not like they\u2018d have been any happier if you hadn\u2019t told them in advance. When she says you should\u2019ve said nothing what she means is you should\u2019ve chosen stepdad over grandpa, because that\u2019s the only way not telling them would have made the situation better from their point of view. \n\nIt sounds like you could\u2019ve phrased it differently but in the end, you chose what was right for you and you told them in advance so they won\u2019t assume falsely and be disappointed the day of. Would\u2019ve gone no AHs regarding the wedding if they had just accepted it and moved on, but they didn\u2019t.", "NTA. \n\n>They wanted to know why not John.\n\nYou'd already told them what you wanted.\n\n>Mom said I should have said nothing.\n\nThey wanted to know why.", "NTA,\n\nYou are definitely not the A for telling them. They may have assumed the wrong thing if you had not told them and the hurt would have been worse for them to find out in an indirect way. Congrats! Wishing you and your partner many many years of happiness", "NTA, it is your wedding and only your decisions matter. Do what makes you happy OP, you (hopefully) will only get to do this once so it is your choices that matter.", "NTA. Your grandfather would likely be overjoyed to fill the role. You're basically what he has left of his son in this world. I'll say what I said on another post about a wedding: it's *your* wedding, and you decide what happens on your side of the aisle.\n\nYou didn't mention if either of your half-siblings are girls, but if John is going to get to be the father of the bride for either of them, then he should be happy with that, and he should understand that *you* want to share this moment with your father in the only way you can, through your grandfather.", "NTA\n\nif you went by your mom\u2019s advice, you\u2019d be the AH for not telling him and getting Johns hopes up. If you tell them he won\u2019t be involved as the FOTB you\u2019d be the AH AH for not having him take part. There\u2019s simply no winning, OP. Do what makes you happy and many well wishes for your marriage.", "NTA\n\nYour mom and step dad will just have to adjust. Your grandfather will have the honor of walking you down the aisle. Congratulations on your special day, and rest assured that through your grandfather, your dad will be there with you in spirit.", "NTA - you were the adult in this situation by communicating with them. You absolutely needed to tell them so that there were no assumptions on the wedding day. Good Luck!", "NTA, they already knew why not John and chose to ask the question anyway.", "NTA, they already knew why not John and chose to ask the question anyway.", "NTA. It\u2019s clear they expected John to fill this role. If you hadn\u2019t told them, it was have made your wedding day pretty miserable.", "NTA - your mom wasn\u2019t on trial for moving on, and her partner selection didn\u2019t make him your automatic dad.\n\nThe fact that they think you are close enough for him to fill that role, tell you it\u2019s all about how they want this family to look (yet again, shocker) while not taking how you feel into account. **Well now you\u2019re an adult who can.**\n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, so create a meaningful day for **you and your partner.** John has kids, so his father of the groom/bride moment will come with them.", "NTA. First off, of course, it's your wedding.\n\nI had a wonderful relationship with my father, and my grandfather STILL was the one who walked me down the aisle. (It was because my father was officiating, but I don't think that changes what I'm about to say.)\n\nMy grandfather was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 10 months later. He was symptomatic 7 months after my wedding, and dead 5 months after that. I was the first of my siblings or (female) cousins to have a wedding, and those memories are absolutely irreplaceable. My grandfather looks so proud of me in all of the pictures. He had a major hand in raising me and was my best friend all my life, so it only felt appropriate. And it totally was. Absolutely zero regrets. \n\nDon't let the pressure from others sway you. You're going to have beautiful pictures, and even more beautiful memories. If you think your grandpa belongs in this role, I strongly encourage you not to back down. I don't believe that you will regret it. I most certainly didn't and, again, I had an amazing relationship with my father; I can only imagine the regret would be even less so with a man you don't feel familial attachment to.\n\nBest of luck. I hope your day is as stress free and beautiful as possible!", "NAH - you seem to understand well where they're coming from. They're genuinely hurt, they think John was a good stepdad to you, and you get on well, so this is must just be a way to hurt them, especially because granddad didn't support them.\n\nYou can't help the fact you don't feel like John is \"dad\". You can't help the fact that grandpa does feel sorta like \"dad\". You are not doing this to hurt them, you're doing this because of how much you love your grandpa. \n\nJust keep being honest with them, and make sure they know you do like John and appreciate what he did, helping your mom raise you, but it's just how your heart feels. It's a hard situation, but you'll all get through it so long as you're all honest and respectful.", "NAH.\n\nYour wedding, your choice. But I get that John and your mom kinda expected you to ask him, and they are allowed to be disappointed in this. Because at the end of the day, John DID step up to a fatherly role, and kept that up all the time you didn't reciprocate this. That is not something you did wrong, but it is something he did right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My dad and grandpa look really alike too. Same eyes, same nose, same natural hair color and everything. Sometimes he makes me feel like I'm looking at an older version of my dad. Plus they both have the same quiet but funny nature that I always found comforting. Even when my dad was alive and I was a small kid, if I had a bad day dad's presence could just cheer me up completely.", "All of this. Full stop. Your wedding,  your choice. It was a courtesy to tell them. But there's never an obligation to have anyone, even family, on your wedding. \n\nAlso, it's a great way to honor your late father and your relationship with his dad/your grandpa by having him walk you down the aisle.", "That's probably why you were/are so close to your grandpa. Sounds like he's your best friend. If your mom and step-dad can't accept that, then they suck. Getting married is a special day, it goes fast and the memories last. You want them to be happy memorable ones,  not ones you'll regret or question. Have grandpa walk you down the aisle, have something of your dad's too, maybe a photo or a piece of clothing. That way you have them both with you. I wish you the best OP. You deserve it."]}
