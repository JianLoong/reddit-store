I simply can not afford private school. \nShe sent 3 choices of schools all within a 10 minute drive from both houses. Im still open to them because I don't know prices etc so I'm not shutting down her proposals. \n\nUntil today. She messages and tells me she has gone ahead and added our child to the waiting list for a school that was never discussed or even mentioned. I looked up the school. Its an hour away from both homes and very very expensive. \nI told her I wasn't happy she did that behind my back without even running the idea by me first. She then tells me she did talk to me about it so I ask to see messages proving that conversation happened (all communication is via text) she then tells me \"I'll look for it when I have time but you probably deleted the messages\" \nI stated that I have no way to delete her messages only my own and if I did it would come up as \"message deleted\" so it would be very obvious to see if this conversation happened or not and if I tried hiding my responses. No reply. \n\nLater on in the day I get an email from the school. Sending me all the enrolment forms etc. \nHere's where I may be TA. \nI responded to the email stating my ex had done this without my knowledge and i would like my information removed from their system and if my ex and I agree to enrol our son there I will contact them at that time. \nThey then responded telling me they need both parents consent to add a child to an enrolment list and as my ex had not informed me or had my consent they would be removing my son from the list until they are told otherwise by BOTH parents or a court order. \n\nMy ex is furious.

Your ex was wrong to do the waitlist without asking, but you're wrong to deny your son the best education available because it hurts your manly pride that the little woman would be paying for it.", "ESH Obviously you ex did something and lied to you. However are you really going to punish your son just because you can\u2019t afford to pay 50%?", "ESH your ex sucks for lying, you suck for not having a proper conversation with her about costs. If she wants to send your child to private school , and if the private school provides a better education,  you could agree to contribute what 50% of public school would cost and she could pay the balance as it\u2019s her wish. Put your child first \u2026.both of you", "This specific instance is vagues but it seems like YTA generally. Seems like you have no clue whats going on with your kid considering you were \"surprised\" that it was important to get on waitlists for school. Having no initiative and being petty are going to make the coparenting relationship fall apart real quick.", "NTA What is in your child agreement? Mine states my ex will have to pay 100% private school fees bc to me, the public schools are just as good or better with my sons needs. I won\u2019t agree to private unless it\u2019s in his best interests. An hour ride each way for a 3 yr old?! Is it full day? Who gets him midday when work is in?", "Yes and a 2 hour commute a day to school would be a deal breaker for me.  That is a long commute and huge commitment to make for a 5 or 6 year old kid.", "She won't even do pick up or drop off's now and she lives 10 minutes from me. \nYet she wants to drive an hour each way 5 days a week. It's mind boggling.", "It sounds like there is some agreement between OP and their ex to split costs 50/50 for things related to their son, that\u2019s how I interpreted it at least. OP is perfectly reasonable for not wanting to pay for something they can\u2019t afford and also for not wanting to send their son to a school an hour away from both houses.\n\nNTA OP. Your ex is being really disrespectful", "Let me just be very clear. This school is not \"the best\" \nShe said and I quote \"it's in a good area and will give us status\" she couldn't tell me one reason why this school would benefit our son the best compared to ones closer. \n\nIf the very best school happens to be a private school I will not let my \"manly pride\" Stop my son from going to a good school. \nThe fact she didn't discuss her doing this when it stated in paperwork we are to BOTH make these decisions and agree before going ahead is what I'm pissed about. \n\nI was abused by this woman for almost 2 years after our son was born. This isn't the first shady thing she's done. \n\nWhere's my manly pride telling reddit I was abused by a woman and was too weak to leave right away..  gtfo.", "OP paying for something they can\u2019t afford punishes both of them, as it means their living situation likely suffers", "You suck for assuming I haven't tried. \nThis was an abusive relationship and it's why I left and the communication is now limited and only via text. \nYou think a person that does things like this is one you can have a reasonable conversation with? \n\nThe reason all communication is over text is because it all needs to be able to be documented.", "There absolutely is a 50/50 agreement on all costs. \nAlso I do all of the driving. So i don't think her choosing a school so far away before even discussing it with me was okay to do. Had she told me I would have told her I want to look at options closer first then if we can't find a good school we broaden our search area.", "So have the conversation about school fees by text \u2026.don\u2019t let your son suffer the consequences because you and your ex can\u2019t communicate"]}
