He isn't taking care of you the same way you took care of him. Are there other ways in which he is taking more from this relationship than he's giving?", "NTA. Just go to bed in your bed. If he has a problem (being woken up by your coughing), he can offer help to you, or go to the couch himself.\n\nHe thinks it's \"not a big deal\" if you don't sleep well? Yes, it is.\n\nHe's being an AH to you while you're sick, after you took care of him when he was sick. That's a problem.", "NTA. You slept on the couch for him. Why can he not do the same for you?\n\nSick person always gets maximum comfort. Well person makes a couple compromises in the name of sick person\u2019s rest and healing. And disrupted sleep for you while you\u2019re sick will keep you feeling ill for longer.\n\nYour husband needs to take the couch this shift, he\u2019s being such an asshole for not only not volunteering, but arguing with you because your job is \u201clesser.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nYou allowed him to have the bed all to himself while he was sick and he isn\u2019t doing for you what you did for him. He\u2019s being incredibly selfish. The fact that he values sleeping with the AC more than you getting proper sleep while you\u2019re sick speaks volumes.", "NTA. If you had to sleep on the couch when he was sick, then it's only fair he has to sleep on the couch when you're sick.

Especially if he is going to be up early clanging about around the couch. \n\nI don't appreciate his dig at you career/education either. WFH is not less valid than any other form of employment, especially when you're clocking 50-60 hours a week in addition to studying. As if his commute time gives him a greater claim to the bed. \n\nIf he won't give up the bed, take your snotty nose and sick bugs right back into bed beside him. He can retreat from the phlegm or he can get phlegmy all over again. \n\nHope you get better soon OP.", "NTA - he is being an entitled, selfish AH. Sleep in your own bed tonight.", "What a jerk.

Might as well be in it together", "Firmly NTA! I would probably have let your husband get away with staying in the bedroom until the part where he wakes you up in the morning because he works out? If he's getting up before you and is fit enough to exercise, he should let you rest and give you the bed! What an ass.", "NTA But pay attention to what he is telling you.

Gets sick and wife was nice enough to take one for the team and sleep on the couch for him to get good sleep\n2.

Belittles your time at work and classes by saying your time is not as valuable so its not a big deal if you don't sleep well.\n4. Knows that he'll inevitably wake you, his sick wife up because he'll wake up early to exercise and surf, with the bloody surfboards right above you.\n\nI think he should be the one making an AITA thread here in which he'll get a resounding YTA from everyone.", "NTA, he's an egoistical prick.", "He is the a hole, or is his choice to stay in the bedroom if he wants to run the risk of catching what you have. If he isn't happy then it's his choice to go to a different room. Sounds like your partner is very selfish, my wife is the same. Expects me to sleep in another room regardless, she is currently ill with a horrendous bug because she didn't take my advice to sleep elsewhere.", "YTA. You're married, you both have equal rights to the bed. Either can choose not to sleep in that bed, for whatever reason, but you cannot tell your spouse to not sleep in that bed, unless you're ready for divorce. Same goes for your spouse.

Wife don't wanna catch whatever I have so she's been sleeping the past week in our spare room on a bunk bed or the couch when she fell asleep on. We both do this to insure the other don't get sick. \n\nYour husband sounds like a big baby and should step up and sleep on the couch.  A few nights on the sofa will not kill him.
