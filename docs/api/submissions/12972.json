If he has a problem (being woken up by your coughing), he can offer help to you, or go to the couch himself.\n\nHe thinks it's \"not a big deal\" if you don't sleep well? Yes, it is.\n\nHe's being an AH to you while you're sick, after you took care of him when he was sick. That's a problem.", "NTA. You slept on the couch for him. Why can he not do the same for you?\n\nSick person always gets maximum comfort. Well person makes a couple compromises in the name of sick person\u2019s rest and healing. And disrupted sleep for you while you\u2019re sick will keep you feeling ill for longer.\n\nYour husband needs to take the couch this shift, he\u2019s being such an asshole for not only not volunteering, but arguing with you because your job is \u201clesser.\u201d", "NTA. \n\nYou allowed him to have the bed all to himself while he was sick and he isn\u2019t doing for you what you did for him.

Especially if he is going to be up early clanging about around the couch. \n\nI don't appreciate his dig at you career/education either. WFH is not less valid than any other form of employment, especially when you're clocking 50-60 hours a week in addition to studying. As if his commute time gives him a greater claim to the bed. \n\nIf he won't give up the bed, take your snotty nose and sick bugs right back into bed beside him. He can retreat from the phlegm or he can get phlegmy all over again. \n\nHope you get better soon OP.", "NTA - he is being an entitled, selfish AH. Sleep in your own bed tonight.", "What a jerk.

Might as well be in it together", "Firmly NTA! I would probably have let your husband get away with staying in the bedroom until the part where he wakes you up in the morning because he works out? If he's getting up before you and is fit enough to exercise, he should let you rest and give you the bed! What an ass.", "NTA But pay attention to what he is telling you.

If he isn't happy then it's his choice to go to a different room. Sounds like your partner is very selfish, my wife is the same. Expects me to sleep in another room regardless, she is currently ill with a horrendous bug because she didn't take my advice to sleep elsewhere.", "YTA. You're married, you both have equal rights to the bed. Either can choose not to sleep in that bed, for whatever reason, but you cannot tell your spouse to not sleep in that bed, unless you're ready for divorce. Same goes for your spouse.

Wife don't wanna catch whatever I have so she's been sleeping the past week in our spare room on a bunk bed or the couch when she fell asleep on. We both do this to insure the other don't get sick. \n\nYour husband sounds like a big baby and should step up and sleep on the couch.  A few nights on the sofa will not kill him. Talk with him and if he still isn't going to the couch then lay next to him and cough see long it takes him to head for the couch.", "NTA. I can't imagine *not* volunteering to sleep on the couch when my partner is sick (except for when she preferred to sleep there herself because it was easier to be propped up to deal with stuffy nose).

Let him have a big fit, just stay calm and ignore his tantrum. He has a fit to bait you into a fight. And let him blame you for his crankiness tomorrow and again, just ignore his tantrum.

The dogs woke both of us up at three am to go out and we couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. My partner took the dogs out and then sat up on the couch watching TV. I stayed in bed but couldn\u2019t fall asleep so I joined them. \n\nMe: I might fall asleep again out here so just leave me on the couch if I do.\n\nThem: Do you want me to turn off the TV and hang out in the bedroom instead so I don\u2019t disturb you?\n\nMe: No, you were here first so I don\u2019t want to kick you out just because I\u2019m sleepy and can\u2019t sleep in bed.\n\nThem: But you have to get up for work early and I don\u2019t, so it\u2019s less disruptive if I go back to the bedroom and watch TV in there and you stay out here. \n\nMe: Okay, thank you for thinking of me. I\u2019ll keep the dogs out here so they don\u2019t wake you when I do get back up. \n\nThen I come on here and read this selfish crap from your husband.

But - do you often \u201cnot want to deal with it\u201d as cave as a result. If yes, he is taking advantage of this. I get with being sick you may not have the energy, but at some point you have to push back. \nIf your illness doesn\u2019t make completely unbearable go to your bed and sleep there. Stay there no matter how much you cough, even if he protests. Wait him out. He may get fed up and leave the room.\nIf he doesn\u2019t and blames you for his crankiness then say this, \u201cit\u2019s YOUR fault that you\u2019re cranky. I\u2019m sick. I need the better accommodations. You chose to stay under those circumstances\u201d.\nThis sounds like my marriage. I do push back now.
