I don\u2019t want to jump to the worst case scenario as the internet is want to do, but even things like grabbing or holding him in a forceful way? Scaring him as a \u2018joke\u2019?

No child should every be told \"You can't get away from me.\" I don't care if it's 'only vibes' and the guy has never done anything that would involve police--he's an AH and you have the absolute right to protect your child by keeping him away.", "A young child having an aversion to your uncle like that, and the way your uncle responded is raising some huge red flags for me.

He should try to woo your son with treats or something not scare the living daylights some more. Does he not have kids?", "nta", "Not that I\u2019m aware of so like he\u2019s only seen him a handful of times but even on the very first interaction he wasn\u2019t feeling this guy. I feel his overall vibe does pass the baby check.", "A lot of kids need to toughen up tho. Not like this but children are getting f*cking plump to the point its scary. They need to get out into nature, breathe some wilderness air and try to be bad at stuff. Way too many get their expectations up to be perfect at everything the first try and give up since they don't Ace it.", "same, why does the kid love everyone except him? Sadeg", "I'd say always listen to children more than yourself on these matters.   \nAn old family friend tried to grab me in an inappropriate way once and no one believed me he did. From then on i kept my distance and i would never stay alone with him in the same room. No wonder why i liked everyone except him.\n\nYour child comes first in these situations.   \nBy creating this boundary you may have offended an adult, yes, but you also may have protected YOUR child from potential abuse (of any kind).\n\nAlso, the phrases \"you can\u2019t get away for me\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to toughen you up\u201d are not at all appropriate, for me these sound very forceful and it's childish (and creepy) behavior from an adult to say these things.", "There is no need to become paranoid about this; babies are people too, and they get irrational dislikes sometimes, they just don't have the filter to hide them like we do. My cousin's baby burst into tears everytime she saw my sister's husband (then boyfriend) from the first time they met; we eventually found out she doesn't like dark beards. But my brother-in-law never demanded to hold her or try to get her to accept him by force.", "Maybe it's his vibe, maybe it's because he has a loud voice/large beard/bad breath/who-knows-what that makes him scary/unpleasant to your kid, but no matter what the reason is, your child needs to feel safe."]}
