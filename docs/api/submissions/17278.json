We don't teach kids how to handle failure or rejection so end up with these incels and other very angry types who've been raised to believe they can do anything so if they fail or are rejected it must be someone else's fault.\n\nHowever, in this particular example the uncle is in the wrong. I would welcome more kids being comfortable expressing their personal boundaries about their bodies. That might mean then if someone ignores those, the kid also feels comfortable telling another adult what happened to them.", "Glad that we're clearly in agreement. This uncle can fuck off.

We are long past the days of forcing kids to show affection to people they aren\u2019t comfortable with, and for good reason. Most children are hurt by people they know, people close to the family. This is a statistical fact. I HATED when my parents would force me to hug people for greetings and goodbyes. I refuse to do it to my kids.
