I don\u2019t want to jump to the worst case scenario as the internet is want to do, but even things like grabbing or holding him in a forceful way? Scaring him as a \u2018joke\u2019?

He should try to woo your son with treats or something not scare the living daylights some more. Does he not have kids?", "nta", "Not that I\u2019m aware of so like he\u2019s only seen him a handful of times but even on the very first interaction he wasn\u2019t feeling this guy. I feel his overall vibe does pass the baby check.", "A lot of kids need to toughen up tho. Not like this but children are getting f*cking plump to the point its scary. They need to get out into nature, breathe some wilderness air and try to be bad at stuff. Way too many get their expectations up to be perfect at everything the first try and give up since they don't Ace it.", "same, why does the kid love everyone except him? Sadeg", "I'd say always listen to children more than yourself on these matters.   \nAn old family friend tried to grab me in an inappropriate way once and no one believed me he did. From then on i kept my distance and i would never stay alone with him in the same room. No wonder why i liked everyone except him.\n\nYour child comes first in these situations.   \nBy creating this boundary you may have offended an adult, yes, but you also may have protected YOUR child from potential abuse (of any kind).\n\nAlso, the phrases \"you can\u2019t get away for me\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to toughen you up\u201d are not at all appropriate, for me these sound very forceful and it's childish (and creepy) behavior from an adult to say these things.", "There is no need to become paranoid about this; babies are people too, and they get irrational dislikes sometimes, they just don't have the filter to hide them like we do. My cousin's baby burst into tears everytime she saw my sister's husband (then boyfriend) from the first time they met; we eventually found out she doesn't like dark beards. But my brother-in-law never demanded to hold her or try to get her to accept him by force.", "Maybe it's his vibe, maybe it's because he has a loud voice/large beard/bad breath/who-knows-what that makes him scary/unpleasant to your kid, but no matter what the reason is, your child needs to feel safe.", "NTA, he may just be an adult that doesn\u2019t grasp boundaries and completely harmless. However the child said no, that needs respecting - have you ever seen those kids being tickled where they are screaming and having zero fun but the adult sees nothing wrong? That\u2019s what I am getting here, an adult that feels like he is being friendly with a new child but actually crosses boundaries.\n\nHowever you made it clear, the child said no, respect that. That is you sticking up for your child.", "NTA, your son probably doesn't like your uncle BECAUSE he doesn't respect his boundaries, and he understands that, and rightfully resents him for it.", "NTA it's not normal to see someone be visibly upset at your presence and try to force yourself on them physically.", "I got the ick reading this. Everyone\u2019s learning that boundaries are normal and the older generations need to unlearn that boundaries are weird. NTA", "You did the right thing.\n\nYou stood up for your child.  No one should be able to hug him, or hold him without his consent.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. I wouldn't let him alone with my kid ever. He's giving off predator vibes. Trust your gut and your kids gut. This dude is SUS AF!", "NTA, I wish more parents were like this. If my child says \u201cno\u201d, \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with\u2026\u201d then they are not required to allow that person to touch them or do anything to their person. I\u2019m a mom to two beautiful babies, and I was always forced to hug and say bye to people. I felt like I had no choice but to have to allow people to touch me unwanted. My daughter 4, knows if she says no to a hug it means no, and that\u2019s a hill I will die on. \n\nYour son clearly has a problem with that person being in his space and wanting to touch him without permission, and he\u2019s making those signs very clear. NTA!", "Ugh i was like this and i don't even wanna say it out loud why. Please keep him away from him. Children aren't uncomfortable without a reason specially when they are good with others. The way uncle talks is creepy too. NTA.", "Nta", "NAH. listen, all the young kids in my family had a problem with Men With Beards. I mean sobbing, shaking, screaming, and crying. Fortunately, in my case, they were just loud and rambunctious. They would tease the kids about it, but never cross a physical boundary.", "NTA\n\nAnd stay to your and your childs boundarys and rules.", "NTA.  Prioritize your child and validate his instincts.  That is literally your most important job in your life.", "Yeah it\u2019s truly bizarre i mean even his own daughter gets in tears at the thought of him being upset. The weird thing is though is i haven\u2019t the faintest of idea why my son doesn\u2019t like him. Although when he got aggressive about not being able to pick up my son he said he would whoop everyone into place. Like I\u2019m from the view that babies can choose who they like or don\u2019 t but don\u2019t get upset that you can\u2019t hold my son.", "I totally agree that more kids (well, their parents as these kids aren't buying their own food or cooking their own meals) need to take their health seriously and get more exercise. \n\nI also agree that resilience should be taught to kids. They won't win at everything or be successful at everything or pick up every skill they try. We don't teach kids how to handle failure or rejection so end up with these incels and other very angry types who've been raised to believe they can do anything so if they fail or are rejected it must be someone else's fault.\n\nHowever, in this particular example the uncle is in the wrong. I would welcome more kids being comfortable expressing their personal boundaries about their bodies. That might mean then if someone ignores those, the kid also feels comfortable telling another adult what happened to them.", "Glad that we're clearly in agreement. This uncle can fuck off. It's not a child's/anyone's duty to enjoy the company of strangers. If uncle gives off bad vibes then it's the uncles problem (if he wanna hang around the kid)."]}
