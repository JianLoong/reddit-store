Victoria is an extremely sweet person and I honestly don't want her to get hurt. \n\nSo I told Victoria about Chloe, and said that while I absolutely would support her if she wanted to pursue something with my sister, Chloe has a pattern and it might end up hurting her. Victoria thanked me for the information, and only was saddened by it.\n\nThe next day, Chloe came raging after me, and blamed me for saying something to Victoria because she was acting like a different person. I explained the situation. She called me a childish AH and accused me of getting involved in other people's business.

Prevention via early warnings are the best method of dealing with these people.\n\nDo some of these people change? Absolutely but often the first evidence that they are changing their ways come when they start being up front about their past behavior to prospective partners.

She should not pursue sexual relationships with your coworkers, nor should she use her law degree and the offer of free legal advice  to get a woman\u2019s number and put another notch in her bedpost. Both of these actions really flirt with ethical boundaries if not blow right past them. I\u2019m sorry but you need to divorce Chloe from your social circle from work.

Other than if she's abusive or straight up toxic, it's up to another adult to figure it out on their own. Not for you to get involved. Anytime I've dated somebody, I felt out what their previous dating relationships were like within a few dates.
