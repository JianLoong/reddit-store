Isn\u2019t it in the Bible that Samson would lose his strength if he cut his hair. A lot of passages do say not to shave your head or keep it too long. \nBut even if we were being by the book, then your sister would have to keep her hair hidden and uncovering would be considered dishonorable and you WOULDN\u2019T shave your beards, you would trim them. Also I bet every painting of Jesus he\u2019s seen is him having shoulder length hair. \nThis isn\u2019t about religion. They may think it is. But it\u2019s really about control. NTA\n\nAlso if they bring up \u201cTHat\u2019S tHE olD teStImeNt ITs DIffERent\u201d it really isn\u2019t. Like they don\u2019t say much other than keep your hair trimmed but they don\u2019t say HOW LONG. Short hair like we see for men today was popularized by the Romans (y\u2019know pagans lol) \nLike priests were really the only ones told to keep their hair trimmed as a vow to god. But like I said, it never says what\u2019s long and what\u2019s not, so who\u2019s to say shoulder length is trimmed and hair to your butt is what\u2019s considered long?", "I dread to think how he would treat their children when they arrive\n\nNTA - and make sure you do a thoughtful beard stroke each time you speak to FBIL whilst leaving with a hair flick", "NTA.
