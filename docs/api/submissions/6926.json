{"id": 6926, "submission_id": "107i1l9", "title": "AITA for asking a new coworker where they\u2019re from?", "selftext": "Hey! 32F here. I should also mention that I\u2019m Caucasian because it is relevant to this story.\n\nSo I work on a pretty small team of about 10 people. When we are all in the office together, we typically eat lunch together and catch up since we telework most days and don\u2019t get to see each other much. We recently had a new coworker start, I\u2019ll call her Kay. She seemed really nice and she\u2019s actually a friend of my work bestie who also works in our dept, so I was really excited to meet her.\n\nSo we were all sitting at lunch just talking, getting to know Kay. We started talking about local bars & attractions and I asked \u201cKay where are you from?\u201d to get to know her and see if she\u2019s from the area or not, because if not I was going to tell her about some things to do. In the moment she answered kind of curtly, she was just like \u201cI\u2019m from Colorado\u201d and then turned away from me and didn\u2019t talk to me for the rest of lunch. I didn\u2019t think much of it other than maybe she\u2019s a little shy.\n\nWell today first thing this morning I was pulled into my boss\u2019s office. She told me that HR is going to reach out to me to do investigation on a micro aggression that I made towards Kay. She said that Kay felt that because I asked her where she was from, I meant that I was judging the color of her skin. Kay is a person of color.\n\nI was appalled to hear this. I did not intend for it to come across this way, I was genuinely getting to know her the same way I would any new coworker. I didn\u2019t think asking where someone is from could be taken as an attack unless it was asked in a rude way, which it wasn\u2019t. It was asked in a very casual and polite way and I honestly never in a million years would have thought it would be taken offensively.\n\nIt was weird because in the moment it didn\u2019t seem like anyone thought anything of it, but now my work bestie is mad at me and thinks I was out of line to ask that question. Now today we\u2019re all in the office and there\u2019s a weird air in here and no one is talking to me. Kay came in after me and one by one she said good morning to everybody except me.\n\nI was thinking of apologizing but maybe I should wait until I talk to HR. I also don\u2019t want to apologize if that basically means I\u2019m admitting to something I didn\u2019t do, which is judge someone by the color of their skin and try to make them feel out of place. I would never do that.\n\nI\u2019m still in shock. My husband is also a person of color so I\u2019m just shocked at this accusation, but it did make me reconsider whether or not that is an appropriate question to ask a person of color. So Reddit, AITA for asking where she\u2019s from? Thanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: It has been requested that I add this to the post for clarification. The reason I mention my husband being a person of color, is because my work bestie told me that Kay asked her \u201chas this b**** ever met a POC before?\u201d which to me felt like an attack considering that I\u2019m married to and trying to have children with a POC. I was NOT intending to exempt myself of any unconscious biases because I am very well aware that we can all have them unknowingly, but here again, intent doesn\u2019t matter in these situations.\n\nUPDATE: Well, that was a quick meeting. Kay told HR I asked her where she was from, but also added that I said \u201cyou must not be from around here.\u201d I DID NOT SAY THIS. This person is now creating lies about me to get me in trouble. I am appalled and this is absolutely outrageous. I told HR the truth about what happened and owned that I should\u2019ve never asked the initial question in that way but explained my intention. HR said it\u2019s really her word against mine. They said they\u2019ll continue the investigation and asked me not speak to her until the investigation is complete because apparently she wants nothing to do with me. Which is just great because part of our job requires us to talk occasionally.\n\nI am very worried about losing my job over this. If you have any advice about what I can do if that happens, please let me know.

Whatever.\n\nNow, that question can be tricky, like \"oh really, you are from X? You don't look like, which the I respond, \"well you know, there is no specific way people from my country should look like, isn't it?\" And they shut up or apologize. Luckily that has only happened a few times. \n\nMy point is, unless you made some stupid comments about her response, she is being oversensitive.

The question Where are you from doesn\u2019t bother me. However, sometimes people will ask that question in a way that does bother me. For instance I have an unusual last name. A lot of times people will ask me for my last name and then promptly go Where are you from. Because evidently I can\u2019t be from the US because of my last name. That\u2019s when it bothers me. I\u2019ve even had people that after I\u2019ve told them I\u2019m from NY insist on asking me again where I\u2019m from.

For what it\u2019s worth, though, I usually ask: \u201cWhere is home for you?\u201d I learned to phrase it this way from a mentor, and I really like it.

When a new white employee joins the team, people assume they are from \u201chere\u201d unless they say otherwise and when it is asked of me, it\u2019s usually them treating me like I\u2019m a foreigner who couldn\u2019t possibly be from the Midwest (was born and raised here, just like them) and/or trying to figure out my ethnicity as if it somehow matters. Look up what happened to the woman, Ngozi Fulani, who visited the palace and then got asked multiple times where she was really from - that\u2019s the context in your coworkers\u2019 mind when she hears you say \u201cwhere are you from\u201d", "NAH. Another commenter brought up the point about intention vs. impact; although you asked from a place of well-intentioned curiosity, that question can be a microaggression to POC.", "While I personally wouldn't have gone to HR, I get where Kay is coming from. 9/10 times when people ask me as a POC where I'm from, they seem surprised or flustered when I say that I was born here, so it gets exhausting because it seems like people have already decided that I must be from somewhere else. Then it does make me defensive because what else are they assuming by my skin colour? I've had people question my English skills, despite the fact that it's my first language. \n\nI think being direct with wanting to give recommendations on things to do would've been best. \"Are you familiar with the area? I know a great restaurant!\"\n\nYou're NTA for trying to understand how to broach the question better.

Whether or not you are TA will be determined by your response to the situation. Kay has likely been dealing with micro aggressions all her life, so I can understand why she responded the way she did. Your intentions may have been good, but it\u2019s really important to understand intent vs impact. And how sometimes impact matters more than intent. \n\nAlso, you stating that you are shocked by the accusation because your husband is a person of color is a \ud83d\udea9 to me. You can be racist AND married to a person of color. The fact that you would think being married to a person of color automatically exempts you from being racist is concerning. At the least, it says you have a lot of learning to do and may not have taken enough time to examine if there are any racist beliefs lurking in your heart. NAH, but you have some learning to do. I hope you take this opportunity to do so.", "NTA \n\nThat is a typical get to know you question. She took it the wrong way and is hypersensitive. Now that you know she lies, avoid her at all costs.

She was unlikely to have made that assumption if OP had also been a person of color. What OP is stating by mentioning her husband is that she capable of suspending any inherent racism and accept people based on who they are. and it would be logical to make the further assumption that she also wants to divest herself of any inherent racist traits that she has in her unconscious. as should we all.

I have been asked that question all my life and never once felt uncomfortable with it. \n\nIf it is an ASSOCIATIVE trauma, then OP should be blameless because she has no way of knowing what triggers Kay has. One cannot be blamed for using innocuous phrasing in general conversation if one doesn't know such phrasing will trigger someone. \n\nWe cannot be responsible for another's emotional reaction to common phrases in conversation. I don't see it as anything more than a simple question. I live in an area with 7 military bases within 70 miles, I probably hear that phrase at least once a month because there are people from all over the place because of the high military population, nobody here sees that question as loaded with anything other than curiosity. \n\nI understand the question made Kay uncomfortable, and I also understand changing phraseology to be inclusive, or not insinuate anything offensive. I can see a \"Where did YOU come from?\" in a snarky way can totally create that vibe, but OP didn't do that. I think changing the way we word things is super helpful, but I also think people who get offended easily should be better at reading the intent behind something before going to HR. There is nothing wrong with being sensitive, but one must ALSO use common sense and not imply the first thing someone innocently asks is offensive, but WAIT to see if there is another incident, then judge that person is being offensive on purpose. \n\nWe ALL are responsible for handling our OWN emotions, we can't put that kind of power on someone's INNOCENT conversation.
