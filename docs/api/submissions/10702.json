And people sometimes respond poorly when insulted. Cousin called OP a gold digger. OP called cousin a whore. OP's added context (that current boyfriend of cousin is 27) is what pushes this to YTA territory.", "On no planet was cousin\u2019s comment a joke.", "And everyone is exactly like you!", "To a degree. Shes stillolder and knows better ways to handle a seventeen yr old", "It's why I'm leaning more towards nta, the cousin clearly knew she was insulting her, her own fault getting insulted back. 17 definitely isn't too young to not learn this life lesson.", "even if true, op is 24, not 20. they aren\u2019t peers.", "A 17 year old is a growing child. You\u2019re free to have your opinion but 17 yr olds are children- and commonly angsty ones at that, making posts like these", "There's a reason you have to be 21 to drink alcohol.", "Yeah, I mean... my comment was an exaggerated version of this. I think it's normal to test the waters of the dating world and have shorter relationships when you're starting out. But even if she ends up NOT aiming to have long, committed relationships, that should be okay too.", "She\u2019s damn near an adult and is old enough to know better. Granted, I would\u2019ve walked away, but I\u2019m not gonna get mad at Op for how she responded to being insulted. \n \nShe learned a lesson, sometimes the energy you put out is the energy you get back. Everyone doesn\u2019t have to take your abuse just cause \u201cyou\u2019re a kid.\u201d I can just imagine the kid of person she is to her peers at school", "maybe she shouldn't disrespect OPs relationship with her brother then...", "He told me", "And my business is my business. But that didn't stop her from insulting me", "She refuses to leave him. Can't stop mooching off that guys cash", "You bullied a minor dude, you're the asshole.", "Sounds like you need to learn that lesson at 24. Your immature actions have caused a rift in your relationship because your boyfriend probably expected his grown ass girlfriend to act like an adult. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And your actions had the consequence that your BF is mad at you. You could have corrected her without using that nasty word. You sunk to her level and then sank even lower. And you are supposedly an adult. Although come across as a maybe 14 or 15.", "YTA She's 17 and have had 2 boyfriends in 2 months, that doesn't make her any of what you called her.\n\nShe wasn't nice, with her comment, but you are seriosuly too old to react like that.", "What\u2019s your excuse?", "Clearly you need to learn that as well lol YTA", "Lmfao You are a child 24 year old immature AH", "No, the child being groomed and called a whore is not at fault here.", "I think calling someone a gold digger *unprovoked* is pretty much the same as calling someone a whore *in response to said gold digger comment*", "Whitewash?", "The only reason I don\u2019t say NTA is because OP was a little over the top (by no means out of line, but I think she should have toned it back a bit)", "She could be a month away from 18 and being able to join the army but sure she\u2019s a child lol. If she committed a crime she\u2019d be charged as an adult unless you were the judge apparently because that\u2019s just a child with an undeveloped brain \ud83d\ude44", "21 in America\u202618 in UK 19 in Canada, maybe American brains develop slower? But they still let you go to war, interesting\u2026", "Well, if this relationship continues, you\u2019ve just let him know that you can\u2019t be trusted to be told anything without using it to your advantage.", "That actually makes it even more of a violation that you weaponized this info. If SHE was boasting about this to you,  ok, it's somewhat fair game to bring it up,  bc yeah,  hypocritical if her to call you a good-digger.  But you also jeopardized your bf's relationship with someone he clearly cares about by revealing that he was gossiping about her to you. \n\nThe mature response to what she said (while still subtly making your point): \"Honestly,  that's really not funny.  I make my own money and that's not at all why I'm with him,  I really care about him. I would never be in a relationship with someone for money.\"", "The fact you're still not getting it despite all these responses doesn't bode well for you.\n\nYou don't live on the planet on your own neither are you it's most important occupant.\n\nGet over yourself and understand you are a grown up at 24!", "There are around 100 other things you could\u2019ve replied, instead you called her a slur.", "Exactly. And you should've kept it your business by knowing you're not a golddigger and refraining from lashing out on an unfounded insult.", "What are you 12? Act your age.", "But the repercussions of what you said can be huge. She can cry to her parents about what you said and they along with your BF's parents can hound on him to break up with you. Next time just tell people like her to shut the fudge up.", "She's 17 and immature. You're 24. Why are you going to the same petty level as her? If she's making questionable life choices, that's hardly your concern, but do you think you're any better than her for calling her a degrading name? Because it doesn't sound like you are. \n\nYou could have just explained how the fashion industry is an important expression of art and style or something. And if she's so unimpressed by it, she's welcome to just wear a potato sack rather than choose a fancy outfit. Please learn to argue better.", "She\u2019s a teenager being groomed/abused by adult men, what\u2019s your excuse? You\u2019re a 24 year old adult acting like an idiot and instead of fixing it you\u2019re doubling down on it \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I smell troll.....no longer believe this is real or you are truly the most uneducated human I've ever had the misfortune of communicating with!\n\nIf this is real, I hope you're single soon.", "That doesn\u2019t absolve cousin of her asshole behavior", "Again, you can have your own opinion, but imo a 17 yr old is a child.", "Legal aspects don\u2019t supersede the fact that 17 is still NOT an adult, and there are so many arguments as to why those two examples are horrendous (especially sending 15-17 yr olds to adult prisons). Brain development doesn\u2019t a give shit about what 17 or 18 year olds can legally do in society.", "Or maybe we could focus on voting ages?? Would that be more fun for you?\n\nShe's still a child, as you seem to be.", "Right, and it seems even more troll-like when you look at her post history, and it's just the same few posts reposted in different subs and comments from the last day or so.", "Yeah, the cousin rude as shit but the age & circumstances make OP\u2019s response 100x worse. She\u2019s supposed to be the adult, here but responded like she was a teenager herself.", "[deleted]", "You\u2019re pathetic lol. So when she has her birthday 3 weeks from now and turns 18 is she still a child to you? I\u2019m done wasting time debating with someone like you", "Factually wrong??? How so?", "\ud83d\ude02\n\nJog on then!"]}
