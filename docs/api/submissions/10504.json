There are similar posts where the husband is declared the AH because he's putting his wife on the back burner.\n\nI understand he's grieving. OP also understands he's grieving. She's right to ask if this means every year, her birthday will be about her husband's cousin. A lot of comments will say why she can't celebrate her birthday another day, why can he not visit the monument any other day? If it's a recent loss than I would understand a bit more, but it sounds like it's been at least 4 years since the death (since they started dating 4 years ago).\n\nI'm not trying to put a timeline on grief, but I think your own wife's birthday should also be prioritized. I understand the husband's POV, but to OP it probably feels like she always comes second to the cousin. Of course you should pay respects to the dead, but not at the expense of the living.", "YTA. I understand not wanting him to spend the whole day there, but he should be able to go in the morning, or during his lunch break if it\u2019s a work day, then spend the evening with you. Both events are probably important to him and he shouldn\u2019t be forced to choose.\nPlus, if you want the whole day, why can\u2019t y\u2019all celebrate your birthday the day after?", "NTA, but maybe you could celebrate your birthday the day before or after?\n\nThis seems really important to him, so come up with a compromise", "NTA. Speak gently to your husband about how you feel. From the sounds of it, his cousin passed away years ago. He can honour his cousin every other day, but he also needs to celebrate you on your birthday. Offer to go with him the day after or before.", "YTA. THE WHOLE DAY? Why?", "NTA.\n\nTalk to your husband and discuss a compromise. \n\n1) he continues to attend the cousin memorial on your bday. He needs to make a solid effort to make it up to you the weekend before or after. \n\n2) On rotating years, he goes to the memorial on your bday and then other years he visits his cousins grave a week before or after your birthday. \n\n3) scrap bday celebrations altogether. You celebrate your anniversary and the holidays. Neither person celebrates their birthday so fair is fair.\n\nPresent all three but aim for option 2 as you appear very focused on birthdays.", "Nta- it\u2019s been almost a decade. Not saying that the passing isn\u2019t important but what happens down the road if something does come first- sick child, sick wife, etc? Does the husband always get to go and spend the entire day there?", "YTA. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad and I share the same birthday. \nMy fianc\u00e9s dad died when my fianc\u00e9 was a kid. I knew even before we decided to be in a relationship that that day might be hard on him, for valid reasons, and I told him before we officially started dating that we can celebrate my birthday on a different day if he needs to mourn or grieve or just be sad that day. It\u2019s not hard to be accommodating to someone\u2019s hurt like that", "YTA, I guess I\u2019ll throw the question back on you, why can\u2019t he celebrate your birthday on any other day?  You don\u2019t get to control how someone else grieves and if this is something that important to him to do, then as his partner, you make it work.  Obviously he wants to honor both so making him choose is very AH-ish of you to do.", "Info:\n\n-how long since cousin passed?\n\n-how far away is the monument? And how much time does your husband want to spend there? \n\nIf the death is recent, you are the AH. \n\nIf he just wants to spend 1-2 hours at the monument and can also celebrate your birthday with you, then you are the AH for making a big deal about needing the WHOLE day. \n\nIf he is unwilling to do anything to honor your birthday that day, and the death is far enough in the past that you have reason to believe he will fail to recognize your birthday every year into the future, then you are not the AH to be concerned. \n\nThere are a lot of potential scenarios between those. You haven\u2019t provided any info about whether either of you had proposed to meet in the middle.

I choose to celebrate the life. But I understand both sides.", "YTA. This is a deeply held cultural tradition of the person you married. How do you not know this? And the whole day? Are you 10 years old? \nGood night this smacks of willful ignorance and immaturity.", "Info how long is he gone? An hour? Half the day?", "YTA. Consider that day sacred to him and celebrate your birthday the day after or plan something fun for the weekend. Hell, I haven't celebrated my own birthday in years because it's just another day.", "NTA. However, I think you need to gently discuss your feelings with your husband. Is there a way to slow for time early in the day that he can visit the memorial?", "NTA, but he\u2019s not going to stop, so plan your birthdays accordingly.", "YTA. You do not have to celebrate your birthday on the exact date. Most of us work on our birthdays anyways, and don't feel the entire day needs to be dedicated to us. And besides, grief trumps adult's birthday celebration.", "YTA. Holy shit. I thought this was going to be one of those \"husband prioritizes work over me\" sorts of posts, but this? Why not just celebrate your birthday on the following weekend? The date will always be a reminder of his cousin's death, but it isn't uncommon for people to celebrate birthdays days or even weeks after they occur. Your husband sounds like a great guy, honouring his deceased family member. He was close to his cousin, mind you, it isn't some distant relative. (And even if it was you'd still be TA.) Going to the monument any other day would not share the same significance.\n\nYou sound selfish and your husband is right, you don't understand him.", "I'm going YTA, it sounds like he goes to this monument for not very long, and then returns?\n\nIt's not like he's away the whole day?\n\nI'm guessing you're young and you think \"but it's my birthday!\" is still a valid response to not getting what you want.", "NTA- life is for the living. He should be celebrating you. \n\n(Especially if the day his family mourns is not the death anniversary and an arbitrarily picked day- not sure on that comment from above, it needs more clarification)", "INFO: Are you willing to spend half the day with your husband and he can have half the day to grieve his cousin?", "YTA I bet next it will be why do you want to see your mom on mother's day it should be all about me", "INFO: How long ago did cousin pass away? It's insensitive for him to spend all day at his memorial on your birthday, especially if its been a longer period of time since cousin's passing, but it's also insensitive to demand he spend the entire day with you as he's still mourning. I'm leaning ESH here simply because no one wants to reach a middle ground, it has to be one or the other, and I think both of you are being unreasonable.", "why can\u2019t you do both? Go to the monument say your prays or memory\u2019s or whatever and then do the fun bday things or the other way around. It is hard as I can completely understand both points of view.", "NTA His cousins death should not mean that the two of you can never celebrate your birthday on your birthday. But you will not win this.  He is doing what he thinks is more important.  It really sucks to have to beg your partner to spend time with you.  Sorry.  I hope in other ways he puts you first.  If you are always last then why are you together.", "INFO \n\nDoes he spend time with you after? Going off of your phrasing of \u201cwhole day\u201d I\u2019m assuming yes and if that\u2019s the case YTA", "if your husband wants to focus on the dead rather then the living why not book yourself and some friends and maybe their partners too if they are interested  somewhere nice take a few days i mean we had lockdowns for the last few years so why not go big on the celebrations  ..... maybe when you die he will start to recognise your birthday too.", "NAH. I\u2019d be bummed my day is like a depressed shadow day for him, and would also feel bad about not getting to celebrate. He also didn\u2019t ask for the bad thing to happen, and of course is grieving still. I could also see how him visiting a death monument in the morning and coming home to spend your bday with you could also be like\u2026not great vibes. No assholes in my opinion. You\u2019re allowed to want a celebration for yourself at any age.", "INFO\n\nWhy can't he go to the memorial for an hour or so and then spend the rest of the day with you?", "NAH. It\u2019s unfortunate that these anniversaries land in the same date and they are both important. However, i feel like he will be grieving whether he is with you or at the memorial so wouldn\u2019t it be better for all involved to perhaps celebrate your birthday on another date. I would hate for him to be preoccupied and then have neither of you have fun on your birthday anyway.", "Nta, people celebrate the dead more than they do the living which to me is so weird.", "Life is for the living. NTA.", "Unfortunately, YTA. Yes, this is probably going to be an every year thing because that's how anniversaries work. As long as he is not spending the entire day there and ignoring you, you should be understanding.", "YTA. That is a hugely insensitive and selfish request and shows that you completely and totally lack respect for him and his family.", "YTA!\nWhy don't you celebrate your birthday on another day then?  Oh, because that's the day that's special to you?  Same reason he wants to go to his cousin's memorial on that day.  It's unfortunate that it's the same day.  Learn to let him go for an hour or two or even three.  Make plans in advance so that he can work recognize both important events.", "YTA. \n\nYou can also celebrate your birthday on another day if it bothers you this badly.", "YTA. Just. YTA. He wants to go briefly to pay his respects to someone he loves and you're what? Jealous of that? You can have the whole rest of the day. Go with him. You sound incredibly self centered.", "NTA", "I'll make this very short as well, YTA, someone he loved died and he goes to pay his respects every year for a little bit of the day, stop being so selfish.", "NTA, you\u2019re not the ah for asking. Give him another year or two to grieve, shit sucks it really does but you didnt do anything wrong, you didnt choose to be born that day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's also the day someone very close to him died.

You said the cousin died 8 or 9 years ago, and one of you comments makes it sound like they don't do this on the cousin's death anniversary but another day they've decided to do it on. This isn't about grieving but about honoring a cousin on a day picked by the family, which I imagine puts him in the mood not to celebrated even though this is your birthday, which should be celebrated. Since this is his family's event and I'm sure they won't do it another time, and it doesn't sound like your husband will forgo it to spend a day with you, maybe ever. My advice is to make your own plans to celebrate your day without your husband. Plan something you want to do with family or friends.", "NTA, emphatically.  There are plenty of ways to pay one's respects.  The way he's doing it is being disrespectful of a day that should be celebratory in nature.  It's one thing if he had to work.

So all together maybe 3 hours out of the day", "Well, except that to the dead guy all days are pretty much the same so it really wouldn\u2019t matter what day he went to pay his respects and it\u2019s been almost a decade. Does she have to get new boyfriend just because of this bad coincidence? If it was his daughters bday would it be the same answer? Maybe he could start visiting on the guys birthday instead of deathday? Edit to add NTA", "He passed about 9 years ago.

Why should she have to celebrate it a different day just because her husbands cousin happen to die on that day? I understand wanting to grieve but but he\u2019s been doing this for years already.

How long does he plan for this to take precedence over OP\u2019s birthday?", "I said that because the death anniversary date is actually not the death anniversary.

She is his wife she can go too and boom she gets to spend the whole day with him and an hour isn't about her.

You don\u2019t mention the monument being far away from you, so the assumption is that it\u2019s local, and your husband just takes an hour or two to pay his respects.

Come on now, your comment does not convey that.", "When you join a partnership with someone you have to compromise.  We all do things we don't want to do for our significant others sake.
