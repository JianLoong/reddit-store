A lot of comments will say why she can't celebrate her birthday another day, why can he not visit the monument any other day? If it's a recent loss than I would understand a bit more, but it sounds like it's been at least 4 years since the death (since they started dating 4 years ago).\n\nI'm not trying to put a timeline on grief, but I think your own wife's birthday should also be prioritized.

Why?", "YTA.\n\nEdited due to the fact OP is complaining that her husband is gone for 3 hours of the entire day which comprises her birthday.\n\n3 hours without your husband while he goes to his family memorial isn't a big deal. \n\nBirthday or not, it's a childish response to pout about the fact OP's husband isn't with her for the entire day .", "Nta- it\u2019s been almost a decade.

Since this is his family's event and I'm sure they won't do it another time, and it doesn't sound like your husband will forgo it to spend a day with you, maybe ever.

Don't be surprised if she doesn't want to spend the rest of her life having her birthday overshadowed like this.", "Buddy, I made the suggestion, but would you consider doing something else to honour his memory? The two of you doing something together he would have loved, for instance?\n\nGrief has its place and I'm not telling you to move on, but perhaps it is better to try and make the remembrance of the fallen into a celebration of their life with those you now live with?", "I am sorry for your loss, and you nonetheless cleaved to your wife when you married her. Visit your cousin\u2019s memorial either the day before or the day after your wife\u2019s birthday.", "You sound like a nice, genuine person who is grieving and still trying to do the right thing by your wife. The only heartless actions taken here are by your wife and she should compromise - you already are.", "Do exactly what she wants spend the whole day with her on her birthday and that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t plan all these trips and such", "Why did you marry her knowing you were never going to focus on her on her birthday? Once you found out her birthday coincided with your cousin's memorial, you should've ended it.\n\nShe, poor thing, likely assumed your grief would subside and she'd get a birthday but no! Your dead family is more important to you than your living wife.\n\nYou'll never focus on her on a milestone birthday because the only important thing on her special day is your dead family.\n\nGoing on a trip \"for\" her birthday is in no way the same as taking a trip \"on\" her birthday.\n\nYou're acting like you just now found out she has a problem with you, 9 years later *still* grieving your cousin to the point this memorial takes precedent over your wife's birthday.\n\nYour focus on your dead family members are killing your relationship", "Sorry for your loss. A quote that helps me with the challenges of life:\n\n\"I think it would be foolish to believe that there are no problems - life is made of problems. They occur every day to just about everyone around the world and I think that it is important that we should simply accept that that is life and we must live it fully and courageously.\"\n\nSo remember your cousin and celebrate your wife on the same day.", "I am very sorry for your losses.  But I have a question for you....  at what point do you decide that life is for living, and for the living?  Because it is.  Dedicating a day every year to grieving will not change what was, focusing on your wife on her birthday can change what is.\n\nThe situation with your cousin, and it's after-effects are truly awful, but is there some other way you can honor him?  Was there something he was involved in that you could donate to in his memory?  Some way to put some good into the World in his name, rather than having honoring him taking something out of your life?\n\nI wish you and your wife a good solution, and happiness.", "So you're saying you spend money and time on her so you're not heartless. And you do \"everything\" for her?\n\nObviously not everything if you think she should be satisfied with what you think she should be satisfied with. \n\nI get you're grieving someone who's missing and presumed dead. But you might end up missing someone else, who isn't.", "It's the day he went missing. They don't know when he died, just when he disappeared from all their lives.", "Once. ONE day. Every single year on her birthday her husband spends half of it away and all of it grieving. You really think that's her being controlling and an asshole?\n\nIt's not that she won't. She HAS. Every year. I think you're downplaying this like it's some extra long lunch break from work. If this day of grieving is so important to him a decade later...you really think he's mentally just gone for a couple hours? That he can just switch off and all happy go lucky for her? \n\nNot to mention if he's gone that far with other family members, he's likely communicating to arrange that during the day too.", "In the middle of the day", "I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s BS it\u2019s completely unfair for his wife and the cousin passed away 9 years ago at some point there has to be a line drawn. What if a child was born on that day for the family? They would still celebrate the death vs the child\u2019s birthday? At some point grieving can be so much that it\u2019ll be affecting the relationships of your life and family. \n\nMy brother was killed by my dad with shaking baby syndrome and it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day anymore does it? No it doesn\u2019t grief just becomes bearable at times but it shouldn\u2019t overtake your life. I\u2019ve had so many deaths within my family that at some point I shouldn\u2019t let it overtake me. A lot of them were traumatic deaths due cancer. Would I look at thanksgiving the same way? No but I should also know that my FIL would preferred for us to celebrate.\n\nHell there was a Reddit post on here cuz a family was tired of not being able to celebrate their child\u2019s birthday due to a death of a grandma but guess what? It\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault nor the grandma\u2019s but the fault lies in those who want to keep hurting. I\u2019m not saying to ignore it but be mindful who is living and who is there for you. What would happen if OP had died guess the regret of never doing her birthday with her will come into play. \n\nLife is definitely for the living and grief has no time but it does need to have a line drawn where it shouldn\u2019t affect your life in a negative way. Almost everyday I still see my brother falling out of the casket but those days I tell myself it\u2019s okay cuz those wounds are still scars in their own way. How i deal with it has to be a more positive way that it won\u2019t jeopardize my relationships.", "Seriously I was feeling like I'm the crazy one. OP's husband lost a family member and in a \"we don't know when or if he died\" way that really doesn't offer closure. Isn't part of loving him offering him empathy too and understanding this is important to him as a way to honor his cousin's memory and be with family? Either OP was with him when this happened and saw how devastating it was for him or it happened before they got together and she knew from the beginning this was a day of mourning for him. I get why OP might feel upset and this is truly a NAH situation for me except people are acting like he's an awful person for...grieving?", "I can't even imagine an adult getting bent out of shape about their birthday.  Do none of these family members work in customer service or healthcare?  Even having Xmas on Xmas was uncommon as a kid cause my mom worked retail.  I've literally forgotten my birthday over the last few years cause I've been focused on my kids birthdays instead. What an infantile thing to get upset about.", "Agreed. Like, most years this is going to fall on a weekday anyway - is OP expecting her husband to take off work for her birthday? \n\nBecause the opinion in this sub right now seems to be that it's unreasonable to expect other people to prioritise your birthday when you're an adult...except when their family has suffered a massive collective trauma and then they really ought to be glued to your side all day to celebrate properly!", "God, yes. I'm upset for OP's husband and it's worse he's in this thread and people feel okay directly telling him how he should and should not process his grief and trauma. I feel like OP didn't sound as mad as some people do in this thread and I understand how she could be frustrated, but people are taking it to a new level and projecting idk what onto this situation.", "Do you assume he comes back or then leaves in a good mood. Seems like the entire day would be sad", "Absolutely mental to me that she's so inflexible. Sure, 24 hours of company is a reasonable request, but considering it coincides with a memorial, can't she ask him to celebrate it with her over the weekend / another day? Sure, you can't move a birthday any more than a death date annviersary, but one of those requires multiple parties to co-ordinate. Imagine if he approached his aunt and uncle with that request?", "I honestly struggle to understand how I overshadow her, truly. I go as early in the morning as we can for about 2 hours in total. Mostly around 7-9. She is usually not awake by then. I come back and later in the day we have dinner and do other activities, because we both of course have to go to work before that.", "Or...he can celebrate her birthday with her for most of the day and also attend his cousin's memorial. What grown adult needs to have someone spend all 24 hours of their birthday with them, especially when they apparently go on weekend-long trips to celebrate it too?", "Cleaved to your wife? What type of stupid ass bullshit are you on? Fuck all the off with that nonsense. She married him knowing this happened way before they met and is very important to him.  He\u2019s not spending the entire day and night away from her. \n\nHow about she stop being a brat over not being able to celebrate her birthday for a full 24 hrs?", "Who are you to tell this person how he should grieve? Have some empathy. For the record, I think it's a NAH situation (and just a difficult one). I can see why it's a frustrating situation for OP, but I think it's unfair to call this man an AH for grieving his family. OP's husband's feelings matter too. And also it's between him and OP to figure out a compromise that feels good to both of them.", "Wow, what d*ck comments to make. Which adult still celebrates their birthday for 24 hours? Why can't she accept and respect the fact her husband is grieving his family and can't he just be away for a couple of hours?\n\nSounds immature and selfish of her not wanting to compromise, especially as he still makes an effort to organise fun things for her birthday every year.", "Okay, this is quite a hurtful comment. Someone else messaged me saying I was a shit husband and should've died with my cousin so my wife wouldn't have ended up with me. \n\nI honestly don't know what else to say outside of what I've already said. I take a couple of hours in the morning to pay my respects to my lost family. You are of course entitled to your opinion but I think many people are forgetting I'm a real person with real feelings. Maybe I shouldn't have commented on here. \n\nI honestly hope no one here has anyone they know have their plane go missing with no answers, an entire family ruined and constant media intrusion so we can't forget even if we want to.", "Why did OP marry him knowing her birthday was a day of mourning for him? See how those are both ridiculous questions? Because there's hopefully so much more to this relationship than this one day. I'm going to be downvoted to hell but people are being so callous about this. This man just shared he lost three important people in his life in a short timespan and in a traumatic way. \n\nWhy is everyone acting like only her feelings matter and his don't? In a relationship, there are two people. He is trying his best to celebrate his wife and grieve at the same time. Why is her birthday more important than his grief? Sure it sucks and I get wanting it to be different but it's not and it's not some switch this man can just pull. It also sucks to lose family members without closure. It literally sounds ridiculous to me to say that she will never have her perfect milestone birthday, as if that's a greater loss than what he experienced. He, I'm sure, would prefer his cousin never disappeared and he didn't have to grieve him and the other losses.", "This is really really mean. Really mean. Poor thing? Bc he takes 3 hours away from her while she\u2019s asleep? I hope he doesn\u2019t see your comment that\u2019s freaking harsh and so off base.", "He already does. He takes 3 hours of his day, spends 2 of those driving, and stays with his family for 1 hour. Comes back and celebrates with his wife", "I'm more heated about this than I should be, but I can't believe how truly awful some of these comments are being to this guy. He goes in the fucking morning. They do their fun activities later on after they both get home from work. He plans trips to NYC and fucking Spain for her birthday because she wants to visit. She's a grown woman, she can't spare a couple of hours the morning of her birthday so he can pay respects to close family members who met a tragic end? (I'm not even going to say died because who knows what the fuck happened to that plane). Read some of the comments he made about you lot sending him awful messages.\n\nThis thread has so much compassion for a grown woman because she loses a couple of hours on the morning of her birthday without her husband, who pays his respects at a memorial. No compassion for the man and his family having to deal with this tragedy. But of course, life is for the living! The husband is totes giving marinara flags!", "The cousin went missing, and the trauma, stress and press intrusion were incredibly traumatic. The cousin's mom and fianc\u00e9e died very soon afterwards. In essence, the family are mourning three people.", "Not everyone comes back miserable from a cemetery. Speaking to loved ones that have passed can be healing and make you feel much better.", "All I'll say is that if this was gender reversed on this sub,  everyone would be saying this man has no empathy and doesn't even care about his wife and is insanely selfish. Not that the wife is putting the dead above the living. It's a pure double standard because men aren't expected to have emotions, and even though everyone pretends that they want men to have and show emotions, here we have a man that is dealing with his grief in a healthy and constructive way and is getting shredded for it because his wife doesn't want that, and neither do the rest of the women on this sub.", "So what? What if her Birthday falls on a work day? Is he supposed to take the day off every year to celebrate?", "What of its a milestone birthday on a Saturday? People celebrate milestones with friends and family but OPs husband and his family have other priorities", "Instead of upsetting a long standing family tradition rooted in terrible tragedy it seems way easier for wife to just pretend her birthday is 2 days later.  I promise no one besides her really gives a shit anyway.", "That is what people do? They get together and talk about you, and the love they had, and still have, and occasionally get a bit sad, but are with other people who also experienced the loss and shared the love. It's beautiful.", "Her husband expects his cousins deathiversary to be more important than his wife's birthday", "Haha, I\u2019ll take those demerits. I\u2019m personally in the camp  that birthdays aren\u2019t all that important after childhood, but I get that OP wants to celebrate. Just has to be on a day without husband\u2019s cousin\u2019s death looming over it.", "I'm gonna need your wife to confirm to us that she sleeps through you being away and that she's woken up in the way she wants to be woken up on her birthday. Your wife clearly cares about birthdays so I wouldn't be surprised if she wants to be woken up by you, some coffee and a croissant or something. That's what we do in this house. \n\nWaking up alone on your birthday when you're the sort of person who cares about birthdays and look forward to it would be really upsetting and would set you up for a bad day. It really would.", "First of all my condolences.\nI can only assume, but maybe you are not yourself after you visited the memorial and the fact you lost so many family members overshadows her whole birthday celevration.\nIt would be way too much to ask you to stop going to the memorial. On the other habd I can understand soneone not wanting to remenber all those desths a loved one had to suffer on a day that is there to celebrate life.\nIt is not really the same, but the birthday of my son is an awful day for me I can not be happy about because it remembes me of the day I almost lost him because he was born premturely and very sick. I try to put on a happy face but I feel more unhappy than any other day and everyone around me can feel I'm uncomfortable, sad and overall depressed. Maybe it's the same for your wife as it it for my family. She can't really help you and you gief and it hangs over her head on her birthday out of all days of the year.\nI'd say NAH. I can understand she us sad about you being sad, if you really go that early she probably assumes that if you'd be better if you wouldn't go to the memorial but I personally guess that won't be tge case. You of course can't help it, you are safmd about losing more than one person and not even knlwing what happened to your cousin.\nMaybe you two should go to a therapy to help you, it's not easy for both of you and you seem to have an overall good relationship. Talk with eachother, comfort eachother, be there for eachother.", "Uhm\u2026wanting to celebrate yourself for a full day on your birthday doesn\u2019t make you a brat. I\u2019m 38 and STILL CELEBRATE my birthday like no one\u2019s business. Why are y\u2019all so grump toward people who\u2019s birthday is their special day?!", "I can\u2019t believe some of these comments. They\u2019re heartless. Like so beyond f*cked up. The poor husband. What\u2019s three hours in the morning while she\u2019s sleeping??? I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one who thinks this is insane.", "The memorial cuts into the middle of the day and limits birthday options. \n\nWhy can't he just celebrate her birthday the way she wants to? Not secondary to a memorial? She will always be in second place", "It hurts because you see truth.\n\nDo you remember that your wife is a real person with real feelings?\n\nWas your cousin the pilot of flight 370?", "He's the only one who knew he'd never celebrate her birthday and that his cousins memorial would always take precedent.", "My mother died on my father's birthday- and we still held a big birthday party for him on his 75th birthday, 5 years later. He grieved deeply for the loss of his wife but he also appreciated that everyone he loved could be with him and celebrate his life. Does she need the entire day with her husband? I don't know, the husband should talk to her and find out how she feels instead. Look at things from her perspective for a change.", "Doesn't matter to me and my family doesn't really even celebrate milestone ones for adults either (like entire extended family).  I don't get it at all.  You're grown, not a child, and no one cares (nor should they) about your birthday past age 21.", "No one giving a shit about her is precisely the problem.", "Minor correction: it's not the day they learned he died, it's the day he went missing. He has never been found.", "From the sound of it the cousin went missing. ~~They found the body a long enough time later that no-one can tell whether he died the first day he went missing or whether he survived several days before dying.~~ They never found his body, and still don't know what happened. There was a lot of ghoulish speculation in the press, and the cousin's mother and fianc\u00e9e died very soon afterwards.\n\nAny way you look at it, that's significant trauma for the family.", "Absolutely!", "He takes her out for dinner at night and away on holidays for her birthday - she's not bad off at all.\n\nThat memorial was there before her and she knew what she was getting into, it's only a small compromise on her end. She is not 'second place' stop being so dramatic, it's one day of the year where he'll be away for a few hours. Part of marriage is give and take, he's doing both she just wants to take.", "Wow, Reddit has hit a new low. You guys are being incredibly rude to a guy who's being very open with internet strangers about his grief and it's obvious he's doing his very best. It does *not* cut into her princess day. He goes early in the morning, then they do their fun things later in the evening after they both get home from work. There are people saying some awful, awful things to this guy. \n\nYou guys are so compassionate towards his wife because her husband isn't with her for a couple of hours in the morning of her birthday (but is there for the rest of the day and plans trips that she wants), but don't have an ounce of the same compassion for a man who lost close family members in a very, very tragic way.", "Does she/he never work on her birthday? If my b'day is midweek, I often wait until the weekend to properly celebrate it. Her husband's morning arrangements don't even cut into the day, by the sounds of it.", "If someone loved me enough to plan a trip to Spain for my birthday I wouldn't be complaining that he only took me out for a nice restaurant dinner on my birthday. \n\nGrief doesn't follow a timeline, especially when there's no closure and it sounds like he still does a lot to celebrate his wife. Jumping to they should never have married is peak Reddit tho, marriage is supposed to be about compromising to make room for both partners' feelings, not one person giving up everything important for the the other.", "Thus trying to balance by having a memorial for his cousin then taking her out to dinner later - don\u2019t forget him setting money and time aside for her birthday trip.", "Agreed. On top of this, her birthday is the day they found out, not the actual date of death. Celebrate the living over the dead.", "I have a zoo pass and have drove over an hour to visit the zoo and wandered around by myself. I might just go on my birthday this year.", "A lot of people celebrate their birthday annually, whether just with immediate family or having a bif party. I know people of each sort. \n\nSome people care and there's nothing wrong with it", "An adult regarding their birthday like a child us the problem.", "Yeah it sounds absolutely awful. I'm really kinda upset for OP's husband the way people are continuing to talk about and directly to him even with this context.", "So she can choose between a late in the day celebration or celebration on a different day but not going on a day trip or to an event in the middle of the day?", "And she married into the family *knowing* that they had suffered a massive collective trauma when her husband's cousin went missing. Knowing that his disappearance killed his mother and fianc\u00e9e.", "In general I find it juvenile but have no real problem with it if that's what's important to them.  I do think prioritizing your own birthday over all other considerations is selfish and an asshole move when the family already has a long standing tradition of mourning a horrific loss."]}
