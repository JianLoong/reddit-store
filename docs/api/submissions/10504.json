A lot of comments will say why she can't celebrate her birthday another day, why can he not visit the monument any other day? If it's a recent loss than I would understand a bit more, but it sounds like it's been at least 4 years since the death (since they started dating 4 years ago).\n\nI'm not trying to put a timeline on grief, but I think your own wife's birthday should also be prioritized. I understand the husband's POV, but to OP it probably feels like she always comes second to the cousin. Of course you should pay respects to the dead, but not at the expense of the living.", "YTA. I understand not wanting him to spend the whole day there, but he should be able to go in the morning, or during his lunch break if it\u2019s a work day, then spend the evening with you.

Why?", "YTA.\n\nEdited due to the fact OP is complaining that her husband is gone for 3 hours of the entire day which comprises her birthday.\n\n3 hours without your husband while he goes to his family memorial isn't a big deal. \n\nBirthday or not, it's a childish response to pout about the fact OP's husband isn't with her for the entire day .", "Nta- it\u2019s been almost a decade.

I knew even before we decided to be in a relationship that that day might be hard on him, for valid reasons, and I told him before we officially started dating that we can celebrate my birthday on a different day if he needs to mourn or grieve or just be sad that day. It\u2019s not hard to be accommodating to someone\u2019s hurt like that", "YTA, I guess I\u2019ll throw the question back on you, why can\u2019t he celebrate your birthday on any other day?

This isn't about grieving but about honoring a cousin on a day picked by the family, which I imagine puts him in the mood not to celebrated even though this is your birthday, which should be celebrated. Since this is his family's event and I'm sure they won't do it another time, and it doesn't sound like your husband will forgo it to spend a day with you, maybe ever. My advice is to make your own plans to celebrate your day without your husband. Plan something you want to do with family or friends.", "NTA, emphatically.  There are plenty of ways to pay one's respects.  The way he's doing it is being disrespectful of a day that should be celebratory in nature.  It's one thing if he had to work.

You can celebrate your birthday with him ANY other day. I say this, because likely what\u2019s gonna happen if you force him to stay with you for your birthday, he\u2019s going to be sad and grieving even though he\u2019s not physically going to pay his respects.

That is a huge difference.  What's sad is someone that entitled. This tradition existed before she came into the picture.  If she's that concerned she can start a new tradition for the weekend before or after so she gets her day all about her and he gets to support his family.", "No she's selfish because her birthday is more important to her than his feelings, it's a family member he was very close to. Only a selfish person would make the person they love have to chose between them and the rest of their family", "I mean traditions around death gives some people sense of peace, not everyone likes a party.", "Could definitely also be that. I'm a air traffic controller so this was the first connection I thought of", "Dude, he can literally go the next day, especially since it happened 8-9 *years* ago. Everyone grieves differently but I can't imagine he'd be very upbeat or be able to put himself in a happy mood for her after that, which kind of puts everyone in a weird spot.", "Yes her birthday is more important than some dead dude, that's not selfish that's logic", "Any excuse to be sad ayy", "So he's gonna be automatically happy go lucky by...not going? Yeah, okay. So what if it's years?", "He can go the next day and ignore that it's a family grieving thing?\n\nI don't understand wasting years grieving, but haven't had to and I also don't understand people that think birthdays are an amazing celebration as an adult.\n\nI can't imagine he'd be in a very good mood either way, I'd be more down knowing the person I'm with would rather I stay by them all day than go grieve with my family for three hours.", "What you don't seem to be grasping is its not just him, yes if it was just him going alone every year then I would have said not the asshole however its his whole family.  A supportive loving spouse doesn't get in between family unless they are toxic.  3 hours out of a birthday being too much is ridiculous.  I would never treat my spouse that way. It is selfish.", "Important emotion to have."]}
