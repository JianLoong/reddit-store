If you want to spend time with her, pick some time to save for her, either at home or offer plans yourself.  You haven't mentioned her refusing to spend time with you.

Why would she? If she did make plans, would you choose her over them?", "YTA. When people ask me why I won\u2019t give younger men a chance (for dating), it\u2019s because they act like this. Your wife is an adult, doing adult things, and being rather mature about you ditching her to hang out with your friends when otherwise you would be able to spend quality time together (note: plans not required). *You* are acting like a toddler that can\u2019t sort out his emotional state.", "So you\u2019re throwing a hissy fit because your wife isn\u2019t demanding you spend time with her every minute of the weekend?

Your wife doesn't have to want to be out all the time.\n\nAlso, saying that you don't want to bail on your friends when you have nothing else to do is valid. BUT spending time with your wife is something you are doing. It just seems you don't view it as a \"plan\" so it's not important. \n\nIt sounds like you are looking for an overblown over the top reaction from your wife to prove she cares about it. Heads up, adults aren't usually super dramatic. That would be the reaction of an 18 yr old.

Now he's going out with friends every weekend and she never objects because she doesn't care if he's there or not. He's hurt because if *he* doesn't initiate time together or plan something then she can't be bothered and doesn't care if they do anything or not. He feels like she just doesn't care about him because she doesn't put forth any effort whatsoever to initiate time spent together. Basically he's hurt that he never has the opportunity to say \"Sorry guys, can't make it, plans with the wife.\" unless he makes said plans. He wants her to take some initiative and show she cares and values time with him.\n\nHere's the thing. She isn't \"punishing\" you.

If you're repeatedly complaining about this to her too, she might be less likely to make plans or attempt to ask for your time.\n\nI know it can be frustrating to feel like you're always the one making plans, but sometimes, people with ADHD need a little help setting things in motion and following plans through. \n\nYTA because it seems like you'd rather put effort into spending time with your friends and complaining about your wife rather than collaboratively making plans with her.", "YTA.
