If you want to spend time with her, pick some time to save for her, either at home or offer plans yourself.  You haven't mentioned her refusing to spend time with you.

Why would she? If she did make plans, would you choose her over them?", "YTA. When people ask me why I won\u2019t give younger men a chance (for dating), it\u2019s because they act like this. Your wife is an adult, doing adult things, and being rather mature about you ditching her to hang out with your friends when otherwise you would be able to spend quality time together (note: plans not required). *You* are acting like a toddler that can\u2019t sort out his emotional state.", "So you\u2019re throwing a hissy fit because your wife isn\u2019t demanding you spend time with her every minute of the weekend?

Your wife doesn't have to want to be out all the time.\n\nAlso, saying that you don't want to bail on your friends when you have nothing else to do is valid. BUT spending time with your wife is something you are doing. It just seems you don't view it as a \"plan\" so it's not important. \n\nIt sounds like you are looking for an overblown over the top reaction from your wife to prove she cares about it. Heads up, adults aren't usually super dramatic. That would be the reaction of an 18 yr old.

Now he's going out with friends every weekend and she never objects because she doesn't care if he's there or not. He's hurt because if *he* doesn't initiate time together or plan something then she can't be bothered and doesn't care if they do anything or not. He feels like she just doesn't care about him because she doesn't put forth any effort whatsoever to initiate time spent together. Basically he's hurt that he never has the opportunity to say \"Sorry guys, can't make it, plans with the wife.\" unless he makes said plans. He wants her to take some initiative and show she cares and values time with him.\n\nHere's the thing. She isn't \"punishing\" you.

Do you hate always being the planner more than you love her? Do you need her to hang out with your friends to have those friends?\n\nAnd no judgement, OP, those are genuine questions to consider. Sometimes you love someone but lifestyles don't make it work out. And other times you're just hoping a spouse will stop being who they are (and not accepting them as they actually are).\n\nEither love her for who she is or decide \"who she is\" isn't enough for you and move on.", "Booo", "If u were a female everyone here would be saying u are the one carrying the emotional load of the relationship, and be sympathetic.", "Sometimes you do have to \u201cmake plans\u201d because there\u2019s a lot going on. \u201cWhen do we have time to watch <show>?\u201d Or \u201cwhen can we go see this movie\u201d or go shopping or whatever. But in our house that\u2019s because there are three kids, only one of them can drive, and we all have places to be at different time.\n\nBut we have this one weird trick, and it could work for so many people! We *communicate about it*. Tomorrow, kid 1 has work, kid 2 has a class, and kid 3 has an event out of town. So we talked about it and ..made a plan. \n\nBut we also just hang out together when we don\u2019t have other stuff to do, because we like hanging out together. \n\nI feel like OP could just *ask his wife* what she\u2019d like to do, and find out \u201cdo you want to plan to do something\u201d. But it feels like he expects her to plan something without him *saying* he wants her to plan something. Which makes op TA for not communicating.", "Yeah exactly. If she's introvert and doesn't want to go out, then stay home and make her dinner or something!", "She doesn\u2019t need to read minds, as inept as he is, he has stated what he wants from her. She just gives a generic \u2018I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re happy\u2019 instead of actually talking it through and finding a middle ground. She\u2019s not engaging, she\u2019s attempting to skip it with that phrase. That\u2019s not how to communicate with your partner. \n\nHe is the bigger ah here, but she is not innocent.", "and all you needed was some brain cells and two thumbs to get it out to a bunch of people!\n\nImagine how easy it would be to get that plan to just ONE other person...that you live with... and are married to...", "There's nothing to get. This man is actually a small child.", "I think he wants her to put in effort and make plans for them because I think he does the planning for them \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Which load? He is not even communicating like an adult? Throwing tantrums is but the same as carrying the emotional load.", "That's the vibe I'm getting too. It sounds like he wants her to take the initiative on doing stuff instead of just doing nothing. Bad execution with the yelling, but that part I kinda get.", "She's probably super over going out every weekend. It happens around 30.", "I also think it's a maturity issue. She has hit a chill part of life and hes still wanting to go out. Plans to him are not staying at home and hanging out. He wants to go out or else it's a regular week night. She, on the other hand, works insane hours and probably enjoys the time to decompress. \n\nThey obviously have different needs and can't seem to find a good compromise and better communication skills.", "Yeah, more than anything, they need to talk this out from top to bottom. He's still TA for yelling, but wanting to do stuff with your spouse isn't a bad thing."]}
