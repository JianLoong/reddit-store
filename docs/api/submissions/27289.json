We don\u2019t live far from the school, but it\u2019s not really walking distance. My neighbor has work early in the morning and there\u2019s no one home when her son has to go to school so I\u2019ve always let him ride with me and my son. As for picking him up, my son has football practice directly after school so I don\u2019t need to pick him up. However, my neighbors son doesn\u2019t have any practices so I find myself going to just pick him up often. His dad can pick him up, but his dad also works a lot and goes on business trips almost every other week. So again it\u2019s mostly just me. \n\nEarlier this week, my neighbor was off work and I asked her if she minded taking my son to school with hers since I had a work call that morning I had to take. She said no, which kind of had me taken aback since I figured she\u2019d just do it. I asked her why and she told me \u201cYou\u2019re home, you can take him.\u201d I was honestly just speechless, and so I took my son that day and she took hers. I called her later that day and told her I thought it was pretty rude that she wouldn\u2019t take my son when I take hers every single day.  She told me that her son doesn\u2019t have any other option, while mine does. I told her she should show some appreciation for me because if it weren\u2019t for me, her son would be walking 3 miles to and from school every day. She still kept repeating the same thing, that I\u2019m home so I can take my son, and I told her if that\u2019s how she feels I\u2019m not taking her son anymore. She screamed at me but I just hung up. \n\nI stuck to my words, and yesterday I didn\u2019t take him to school so he had to walk. He ended up being late and my neighbor texted me an angry message about how I\u2019m ruining her sons attendance. My husband noticed the text and asked what it was about. I told him what happened, and he told me that although our neighbor was being a pain in the ass, I shouldn\u2019t just refuse to take her son because it\u2019s not his fault and it\u2019s too far to be walking. Now I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wrong or what to do. I feel like it\u2019s reasonable to not want to take him anymore since my neighbor doesn\u2019t value what I\u2019ve done for him, but I also see my husbands point of that it isn\u2019t her sons fault and 3 miles is a pretty long distance to walk.

It sounds like you've been a huge help, even going out of your way to pick him up when your own son didn't need a ride. The fact that she feels entitled instead of grateful says a lot about who she is. While I do feel bad for the kid, it's his mother's fault for being so unwilling to return the favor.", "Going with NTA\n\nYour neighbor has no issue taking advantage of your generosity letting her kid get rides all the time. When you asked for a favor in reciprocation, she was petty and rude.\n\nShe fucked around and found out. Sucks that the kid has to walk but that's also the consequences of his mom being a dick. I'd probably talk to the dad, since he probably needs to be driving their kid now.", "NTA\n\n>She told me that her son doesn\u2019t have any other option, while mine does.\n\nYour neighbor does have an option, commercial day care providers have before and after programs for \"latch key\" children and provide transportation to and from school. You giving her son a ride is more convenient and doesn't cost a thing. She can also reach out to other parents and try to start car pool. She can contact the School Board and request transportation.", "NTA\n\nIt really sucks for the kid, but that's a result of his parents actions, not yours.\n\nI might change my mind if the kid was really apologetic about how his mom acted. did he ever express his thanks for all you've done for him in regards to the rides?\n\nIf so, maybe you should keep taking him as he's not aping his parents behaviour.", "The kid can thanks his mother for needing to walk 6 miles every day.  He is in high school so its not excessive anyway.\n\nThe mother is a piece of work.  You do her so many favors and she talks to you that way.  Even if she didnt want to take your son to school, if she had responded that she was also busy or unable to do so, that was one thing.  \n\nBut to tell you \u201cYou\u2019re home, you can take him.\u201d smacks of rudeness.  There is no way Id ever talk to someone like this if they were doing me such a monumental favor.  Stick to your guns.

When the neighbor learns some manners then maybe drive the kid to school. Or she can pay for Ubers. Or she can pay you the uber rate for taking her kid to school.", "NTA. Your neighbor is treating you like you're her son's 3rd parent, and it's your obligation to take him. If she can't be decent enough to reciprocate even once,  then F her.  Her kid, her problem. Clearly, she's not your friend. It sucks for her son that his mom is an AH and ruined his rides to and from.", "I have the house where all the kids come and play. They\u2019ll be here for hours and hours and hours. We often feed them, give them drinks, bandaids if they\u2019re needed, etc. They also break things and make a mess. \n\nAnd that\u2019s all fine, we love the kids, but I realized not long ago that in like 6 years of this not one neighborhood parent has said so much as thank you, let alone offered to take the kids one day themseoves, or anything. Most of them don\u2019t even check on their kids. I end up texting them if it\u2019s been like 3-4 hours and making sure they know they\u2019re here and when do they want them home. \n\nIf I\u2019m in a good mood I\u2019ll assume they just don\u2019t understand the stress and mess and even costs of it all. Other days I think they\u2019re just selfish, ungrateful assholes.", "NTA - seriously stop being used. Now you know that the neighbor will never help out why go out of the way to help.

They do have other options - uber / lyft so they never have to reciprocate or they start a carpool with other families where they learn that they would need to help out.", "NTA.

Plus, walking 3 miles is not that unheard of and I used to walt about 2 miles to school every day. Had others who walked even further coz none of our parents had a car.", "NTA\n\nYou're being used. The kid just needs a bike and he'll be set. Their logistical issues aren't your problem, especially after it's clear your relationship only goes one way. \n\nStop being a doormat.", "NTA.  Stick to your guns. Kid is late enough parents will get notified and hopefully make a change. I am sure they are waiting for you to crack.", ">because it\u2019s not his fault and it\u2019s too far to be walking.\n\nIt's not your fault either and you're not his parent.  \n\n\nThis is a problem for his mother to fix. She *HAD* a solution until she became an AH about it. Now **she** gets to fix the issue some other way.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Her son isn't your responsibility.", "Nope. Nope. Nope. NTA\n\nI hope her kid has comfortable walking shoes.", "NTA. You informed the mum that you wouldn't take her son anymore. She was therefore responsible for making alternate arrangements. She refused to do so, obviously assuming you'd still take her son despite saying you wouldn't.\n\nI feel for the kid, none of this is his fault. But he wasn't late because of you, he was late because his mum refused to make alternate arrangements. \n\nMaybe explain to the lad why you've stopped agreeing to take him to and from school, so that he's aware it's not because of anything he's done. \n\nI'm half-tempted to say take the kid anyway, don't make him suffer for his mum's actions, but that's playing into her hands. She's banking on you feeling bad for the kid and going back to the original, unappreciated arrangement with zero reciprocation. So, I think you need to stand your ground on this one. \n\nI can't help wonder if you were getting paid for this? Obviously taking the kid to school means you'd have been going anyway, but you were also picking him up when you otherwise wouldn't be going to the school. So, were you getting money to pay for that? Because it seems very much about taking advantage of your generosity if not, and fits with her reaction to you going through with what you said about not taking him anymore.", "NTA\n\nLet your husband take him.", "It doesn\u2019t cost you anything to take him to school when you\u2019re dropping off your own son, but stop going out of your way and picking him up after school.", "3 miles won't hurt a kid. It's not torture. They will he fine. Stick to your guns and don't let people walk over you. NTA", "NTA! She's rich. Sorry her son will be late but she should've extended you the courtesy you have extended her.", "NTA\n\nI am sorry for the kids. Be also aware regarding insurance aspects. If something happens to the kid in your car, you maybe have to pay compensation.\n\nPersonally, I would still help that boy, especially when he is a friend of your son. But this boy needs to know that his mother is an AH.", "NTA\u2026but it sounds like his mom may be a jerk, but the kid is not.   I would take him and pick him if you are doing the same for your own child.  But I would not go out of my way when you do not even have to pick up your own child.", "NTA \n\n\nI think I would probably still take him to school because you are already taking your son.

If I was your neighbor and knew I would be home, I would call you and offer to take your son to school as I was available and I wanted to return the favor. Along with a batch of cookies.\n\nYour neighbor is entitled. Give it a few weeks. You can offer to take her child again, but because of gas, let her know it will be $10 a week, to help pay for gas and your time. I would probably use the money to buy both the boys a nice treat each week. The boy is innocent and has a crappy mom.", "NTA. He\u2019s a teenager.

So if she is going to treat you like an employee she should pay you like an employee.\n\nAnother option if you don't mind helping the kid but don't want help the mom you could set up a pick up drop off system with the kid.

My dad was an ahole and my friends parents always gave me rides if they were taking their own kids anyway. For the sake of the kid, I would suggest that if you're taking your kid anyway, take the neighbor. If it's an extra trip, dont take the neighbor kid (unless he makes a specific request). But make sure the neighbor kid knows that's the deal, so he can properly plan ahead if he needs to walk. He shouldn't miss school just cuz his dad's an ahole.

He's not even pressuring you to help him out. He is just quietly doing his best and always thanked you. He cannot control his mom's behavior.\n\nConsidering that teenagers should be sleeping in because their bodies naturally keep them up later, I'd tell him that as long as he is there when you are going, he can get a ride with you. It's not costing you much more in gas to take him, but it is a kindness that will help a good kid get a little more sleep that he needs. And if he is with your kid after school, irregardless of the time, he can hitch a ride home too. Not really skin off your back. Kindness makes the world a better place. \n\nI would stop the personal pickups though. That's ridiculous. You are not a taxi service.\n\nFinally, it's totally fair if you're done with the whole situation, but I suspect you're here because you don't like punishing him for someone else's douchery. Still.

My district drew a circle and if you were within two miles, you didn't get a bus. But, my walk was two and a half miles, because of bridges. Multiple bridges, at that.\n\nIt's not like they could just find different jobs or change work schedules. My dad commuted for an hour and a half and my mom worked at a bank as a manager. She legally had to be on-site for regulatory reasons and open valuts and stuff. Not just anyone could do it. They just didn't have time to be at my campus at 7AM.\n\nThere just weren't \"adjustments\" to make. There was a mortgage. And bills. And a stupid start time. I could've caught a ride with someone else had class started at a reasonable hour. But... it didn't. So, I managed.\n\nWhen you have a mortgage and bills, people can't just always 'adjust'.
