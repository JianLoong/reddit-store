We don\u2019t live far from the school, but it\u2019s not really walking distance. My neighbor has work early in the morning and there\u2019s no one home when her son has to go to school so I\u2019ve always let him ride with me and my son. As for picking him up, my son has football practice directly after school so I don\u2019t need to pick him up. However, my neighbors son doesn\u2019t have any practices so I find myself going to just pick him up often. His dad can pick him up, but his dad also works a lot and goes on business trips almost every other week. So again it\u2019s mostly just me. \n\nEarlier this week, my neighbor was off work and I asked her if she minded taking my son to school with hers since I had a work call that morning I had to take. She said no, which kind of had me taken aback since I figured she\u2019d just do it. I asked her why and she told me \u201cYou\u2019re home, you can take him.\u201d I was honestly just speechless, and so I took my son that day and she took hers. I called her later that day and told her I thought it was pretty rude that she wouldn\u2019t take my son when I take hers every single day.  She told me that her son doesn\u2019t have any other option, while mine does. I told her she should show some appreciation for me because if it weren\u2019t for me, her son would be walking 3 miles to and from school every day. She still kept repeating the same thing, that I\u2019m home so I can take my son, and I told her if that\u2019s how she feels I\u2019m not taking her son anymore. She screamed at me but I just hung up. \n\nI stuck to my words, and yesterday I didn\u2019t take him to school so he had to walk. He ended up being late and my neighbor texted me an angry message about how I\u2019m ruining her sons attendance. My husband noticed the text and asked what it was about. I told him what happened, and he told me that although our neighbor was being a pain in the ass, I shouldn\u2019t just refuse to take her son because it\u2019s not his fault and it\u2019s too far to be walking. Now I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wrong or what to do. I feel like it\u2019s reasonable to not want to take him anymore since my neighbor doesn\u2019t value what I\u2019ve done for him, but I also see my husbands point of that it isn\u2019t her sons fault and 3 miles is a pretty long distance to walk.

It sounds like you've been a huge help, even going out of your way to pick him up when your own son didn't need a ride. The fact that she feels entitled instead of grateful says a lot about who she is. While I do feel bad for the kid, it's his mother's fault for being so unwilling to return the favor.", "Going with NTA\n\nYour neighbor has no issue taking advantage of your generosity letting her kid get rides all the time. When you asked for a favor in reciprocation, she was petty and rude.\n\nShe fucked around and found out. Sucks that the kid has to walk but that's also the consequences of his mom being a dick. I'd probably talk to the dad, since he probably needs to be driving their kid now.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nIt really sucks for the kid, but that's a result of his parents actions, not yours.\n\nI might change my mind if the kid was really apologetic about how his mom acted. did he ever express his thanks for all you've done for him in regards to the rides?\n\nIf so, maybe you should keep taking him as he's not aping his parents behaviour.", "The kid can thanks his mother for needing to walk 6 miles every day.  He is in high school so its not excessive anyway.\n\nThe mother is a piece of work.  You do her so many favors and she talks to you that way.  Even if she didnt want to take your son to school, if she had responded that she was also busy or unable to do so, that was one thing.  \n\nBut to tell you \u201cYou\u2019re home, you can take him.\u201d smacks of rudeness.  There is no way Id ever talk to someone like this if they were doing me such a monumental favor.  Stick to your guns.

They\u2019ll be here for hours and hours and hours. We often feed them, give them drinks, bandaids if they\u2019re needed, etc. They also break things and make a mess. \n\nAnd that\u2019s all fine, we love the kids, but I realized not long ago that in like 6 years of this not one neighborhood parent has said so much as thank you, let alone offered to take the kids one day themseoves, or anything. Most of them don\u2019t even check on their kids. I end up texting them if it\u2019s been like 3-4 hours and making sure they know they\u2019re here and when do they want them home. \n\nIf I\u2019m in a good mood I\u2019ll assume they just don\u2019t understand the stress and mess and even costs of it all.

But he wasn't late because of you, he was late because his mum refused to make alternate arrangements. \n\nMaybe explain to the lad why you've stopped agreeing to take him to and from school, so that he's aware it's not because of anything he's done. \n\nI'm half-tempted to say take the kid anyway, don't make him suffer for his mum's actions, but that's playing into her hands. She's banking on you feeling bad for the kid and going back to the original, unappreciated arrangement with zero reciprocation. So, I think you need to stand your ground on this one. \n\nI can't help wonder if you were getting paid for this? Obviously taking the kid to school means you'd have been going anyway, but you were also picking him up when you otherwise wouldn't be going to the school. So, were you getting money to pay for that? Because it seems very much about taking advantage of your generosity if not, and fits with her reaction to you going through with what you said about not taking him anymore.", "NTA\n\nLet your husband take him.", "It doesn\u2019t cost you anything to take him to school when you\u2019re dropping off your own son, but stop going out of your way and picking him up after school.", "3 miles won't hurt a kid.

Sorry her son will be late but she should've extended you the courtesy you have extended her.", "NTA\n\nI am sorry for the kids. Be also aware regarding insurance aspects.

You can offer to take her child again, but because of gas, let her know it will be $10 a week, to help pay for gas and your time.

What sort of person tells you that it's your fault her child was late for school when you had informed her in advance you would no longer be taking her child? Her rude reaction when you asked her to reciprocate, shows a lack of rationality, because it was so clearly in her best interests to take your kid to school that one time, and yet she couldn't bring herself to do it, or even to see WHY she should do it.

Dentist dug it out of my tongue.\n\nUsed to walk home from work in heels because I chose to go drink and sing Karaoke with my friends. \n\nSnow was reserved for sledding, or pulling people out of ditches on X-mas eve.\n\nIf your gonna scoff, at least get it right!\n\nDoes your Mommy's neighbor take you to school, too?", "Really? I didn't. I just walked an average amount because my mother would never have harassed a neighbor into driving me.", "Yeah, congrats on mastering basic arithmetic. As I said, tons of kids walked further than me. But I'm glad to see you doing the very important work of protesting a teenager walking three miles.", "If people cared this much about student rest school would start later (as we have long figured out it should). Weather happens everywhere, get an umbrella and appropriate clothes.\n\nAlso, the kid might arrive sweaty and gross? Is this not the same school system that schedules gym first thing in the morning?\n\nAll these issues are the PARENTS problem. Not OPs.\n\nIn NYC, walking three miles to school means you lost your school MetroCard. You make it anyway and your parents don't try to make it someone else's problem.", "That\u2019s ridiculous. I used to cycle 40 kms a day. 20 kms to school and 20 kms back. You do realize getting sweaty or drenched with rain are things humans can survive, right? You just get a good rain jacket, rain trousers, and gloves for when it\u2019s cold.\n\nMy 14-year-old cycles 3,5 kms to her school, so that\u2019s only 7 kms each day. Through rain, wind, snow, sunshine, only when there\u2019s a dangerous storm her best friend\u2019s dad takes them both in his car.\n\nMy 12-year-old son cycles 15 kms a day, since it\u2019s approx. 7,5 kms to his school. He could take the tram/subway there, but cycling is faster and healthier. So he only uses public transport when there\u2019s a dangerous storm.\n\nMy 9-year-old walks, since her school is so close it\u2019s not necessary to hop on her bike.", "Average walking speed is 2 miles an hour.  So at a regular walk 3 miles is 90 minutes.", "Clearly kids shouldn't be walking/biking in very bad weather. The other points are just kind of fussy? It would be nice if parents took their kids to school, but tons of kids get themselves to school every day. It's not cruel or unusual for a kid to walk or ride their bike to school. (And if they're walking they're unlikely to be sweaty or gross.)", "Don't walk much, do you? My general clip is 5 mph.", "No one is saying OP \"lacks compassion\" if she doesn't. It's entirely understandable to few angry at the mum. But if everyone refuses to help each other, the world is a bad place. The son is not his mother, he's a separate person. Why not help him when it costs nothing?", ">Lot of folks on Reddit seem to think we should all suck it up, \"for the children.\"\n\nOh cut the crap. People here are 7X more likely to be on the childfree sub with hates children. Calling this place pro-children is like calling Texas pro-women.", "All of these people are the \u201cit takes a village\u2026\u201d types. But only when the kid doesnt live in their village. Ugh. Totally agree with your points, it\u2019s not OP\u2019s kid, not OP\u2019s problem", "Would you do it? It is easy to volunteer other people time and money. Of course you don't want to do it."]}
