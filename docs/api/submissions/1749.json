He intentionally dated younger because he couldn't get girls his own age, which shows he wants girls who will put up with him and his faults rather than doing the work on himself. His defense says a lot, too. Why bring up that he couldn't get girls his own age? If he really didn't see any issue, then wouldn't his argument just be that they were mature enough to be in a relationship with an adult? (Not that they were, but it's a better argument than admitting he only went after them because he couldn't get with girls his own age). \n\nI'm also not going to get into the ethics of what constitutes child grooming... But if you are already leaning that way, then yeah, he's apparently cool with it. \n\nPlus, let's be real. If all he needs is to know something is \"legal\" to do it, that doesn't bode well for his moral compass.", "NTA. You have your beliefs and morals. I agree with you, your BF is creepy.

I'm not against age gap relationships per se - my own husband was 17yrs older - but, I was a fully grown adult when I met him, with life experience, and it developed organically like a healthy relationship should.
