We all eat and my wife slides the bill (700+) and proceeds to say. \u201cThe man should  always pay for the wife and her friends.\u201d I laugh awkwardly saying why. She says because I\u2019m the man. I tell her that the only other person I would pay for would be you and me. Her friends proceeded to laugh at me calling me a broke husband. I stand up and put 2 one hundred dollar bills for me and my wife\u2019s food and leave. \n\nMy wife gets home and starts screaming at me. Saying I made her feel embarrassed. How she promised her friends I\u2019d pay. And that her friends made fun for her on the ride home for marrying a man who can\u2019t pay the bill. I decided to pack a bag and head to my friends house.

I\u2019m embarrassed that she thought she could treat you like that. She could have asked you politely prior to dinner like an adult partner. Instead she tried to flex to her friends.

You may need a post nup.", "If it was a remotely reasonable bill I might have a different opinion. But expecting someone to just casually pick up a $700 tab, and ASSUMING they're just gonna pay that?

If she wanted you guys to pay, she should have said so before hand. It\u2019s absolutely absurd that she sprung this on you. And then her reaction when you were in private!? Omg.

You should make it up to your wife and friends by taking them to McDonald\u2019s and saying \u201cIt\u2019s on me.

That was going to be a shifty night had you stayed.", "NTA You are under no obligation to pay for anyone else\u2019s meal when you haven\u2019t agreed to do so beforehand. One of the first things your new wife needs to learn is that you don\u2019t promise your husband  they will spend hundreds of dollars on them without checking in advance to make sure that\u2019s OK. I would also tell your wife that her comment about the man always paying is over the top sexist. If your wife is trying to show off, it backfired on her. Because she is the asshole here.", "Funny how they label you as the broke one, but they have to resort to cheap tricks to get a free meal. Do any of them have partners themselves?", "First of all, that was a cheap trick, her telling her friends you'd pay without asking you first. You're supposed to be partners in things. I mean, she tried to hook you into paying for a $700 meal without giving you the courtesy of asking you first??\n\nSecond of all, the \"the man pays\" thing was a clear attempt at manipulation. \"If you don't pay, you're not really a man. So either pay or feel humiliated.\"\n\nI'd say your wife dug her own hole by not asking you first, or not even asking you privately at the restaurant. Clearly she figured you'd have no choice but to pay. So if she was embarrassed it was her own doing.\n\nIf anyone should be mad, it's you.\n\nAnd I feel bad for you, if you're a newlywed, and this is how your wife treats you. Clearly she has no qualms about trying to manipulate you in situations. I'd be on the lookout for other such things down the road. And I'd definitely try to have a talk with her about how inappropriate her actions were -- once she calms down, of course.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Imagine if you said \u201cwell the woman should do the dishes\u201d etc\u2026 \n\nThat\u2019s disgusting behaviour.

Also WTF was ordered for a bill that high?", "Poor communication on her part does not constitute an obligation on yours. Tell her SHE can pay for her mistakes.", "NTA but your wife certainly is. She picked an expensive place and told her friends you'd pay without asking you. And \"the man\" does not always need to pay; that's garbage.\n\nThough if you intended to pay for you and your wife evenly splitting the bill, your math is a little lacking. 2 out of 6 people at the table with a 700+ bill means you should have paid a lot more than $200 (especially with tip).", "NTA. That is bullshit. Your wife want to look like a baller? She should pay with her own money.", "Why are men always the ones who have to pay when modern society says we are all equal? Fuck that old world belief. Especially paying for your wife's friends.", "NTA, I\u2019m glad you took a stand and didn\u2019t allow them to pressure you into something you did not agree too. \n\nThis happened to me once 4 years ago with my lady and her friend on Valentine\u2019s Day, she got dumped the day before and my lady wanted to be nice and included her in our plans without informing me. \n\nAfter we got home, in a calm and jokingly tone, I said I have no problem paying for your friend, but next time I pay for another friend without prior warning, I hope she plays with my Johnson a little.\nNever dealt with that issue ever again.\n\nI definitely suggest communicating with your partner and see how she would\u2019ve felt if the roles were reversed and you brought friends to your house unexpectedly, and then expected her to cook dinner for everyone. I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d be happy to do that. Also, it might be time to make new friends if they are making fun of her because her husband isn\u2019t a tool. I wish you the best my friend.", "INFO: What was the celebration?\n\nIf it were for you, your wife, or both (e.g. anniversary) and you invited people out somewhere fancy, that\u2019s different to a normal dinner out with friends.", "NTA - Your wife and you don\u2019t have the same values.\n\nShe sees you as her/her friends\u2019 ATM machine and doesn\u2019t respect you, mocking you.\n\nYou married the wrong person!", "NTA\n\nYou teach people how to treat you.  In this instance, you're teaching your wife that you aren't just her wallet.  Good job.", "NTA. This dinner was your wife's idea. If she expected you to pay for all her friends, she should have told you that before you went out, not put you on the spot once you got there. This is really disgusting behavior.

Either the post is fake or you married an unhinged and an idiot. How didn't you notice she's that crazy before actually marrying her?

Neither is acceptable.  \n\nNTA, because paying would have set a precedent.", "Sorry, but your wife seems to be in favor of toxic gender roles and stereotypes.

Is it just me, or does every wife's friends call out her husband by saying something along the lines of \"if you're broke, just say that\"? That pisses me off to the extreme. Her friends should've paid for their own meal. And to the wife who screamed at you when you got home, who tf is she to have a go at you just because you only paid for HER and yourself? She got a free meal didn't she? I guess her friends are more important to her than the husband in these situations which isn't very fair.

We will usually split the total cost between us because we are a partnership and we both have jobs (different story obviously for large pay differences or for SAHP).

If your wife is wealthy, or makes more money than you, then play along. Anyway, she should've discussed with you way in advance. If she didn't discuss with you, then my vote is ESH. If you both really had discussed this, there's always better options than a fancy steakhouse to show off your money. If you make less money than her and she were to see how you'd feel, you guys can have oysters, sushi, or Korean food, etc... Elegant and delicious food doesn't need to just be expensive alone.
