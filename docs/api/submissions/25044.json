We all eat and my wife slides the bill (700+) and proceeds to say. \u201cThe man should  always pay for the wife and her friends.\u201d I laugh awkwardly saying why. She says because I\u2019m the man. I tell her that the only other person I would pay for would be you and me. Her friends proceeded to laugh at me calling me a broke husband. I stand up and put 2 one hundred dollar bills for me and my wife\u2019s food and leave. \n\nMy wife gets home and starts screaming at me. Saying I made her feel embarrassed. How she promised her friends I\u2019d pay. And that her friends made fun for her on the ride home for marrying a man who can\u2019t pay the bill. I decided to pack a bag and head to my friends house.

If she wanted you guys to pay, she should have said so before hand. It\u2019s absolutely absurd that she sprung this on you. And then her reaction when you were in private!? Omg.

That was going to be a shifty night had you stayed.", "NTA You are under no obligation to pay for anyone else\u2019s meal when you haven\u2019t agreed to do so beforehand. One of the first things your new wife needs to learn is that you don\u2019t promise your husband  they will spend hundreds of dollars on them without checking in advance to make sure that\u2019s OK. I would also tell your wife that her comment about the man always paying is over the top sexist. If your wife is trying to show off, it backfired on her. Because she is the asshole here.", "Funny how they label you as the broke one, but they have to resort to cheap tricks to get a free meal. Do any of them have partners themselves?", "First of all, that was a cheap trick, her telling her friends you'd pay without asking you first. You're supposed to be partners in things. I mean, she tried to hook you into paying for a $700 meal without giving you the courtesy of asking you first??\n\nSecond of all, the \"the man pays\" thing was a clear attempt at manipulation. \"If you don't pay, you're not really a man. So either pay or feel humiliated.\"\n\nI'd say your wife dug her own hole by not asking you first, or not even asking you privately at the restaurant. Clearly she figured you'd have no choice but to pay. So if she was embarrassed it was her own doing.\n\nIf anyone should be mad, it's you.\n\nAnd I feel bad for you, if you're a newlywed, and this is how your wife treats you. Clearly she has no qualms about trying to manipulate you in situations. I'd be on the lookout for other such things down the road. And I'd definitely try to have a talk with her about how inappropriate her actions were -- once she calms down, of course.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Imagine if you said \u201cwell the woman should do the dishes\u201d etc\u2026 \n\nThat\u2019s disgusting behaviour.

Also WTF was ordered for a bill that high?", "Poor communication on her part does not constitute an obligation on yours. Tell her SHE can pay for her mistakes.", "NTA but your wife certainly is. She picked an expensive place and told her friends you'd pay without asking you. And \"the man\" does not always need to pay; that's garbage.\n\nThough if you intended to pay for you and your wife evenly splitting the bill, your math is a little lacking. 2 out of 6 people at the table with a 700+ bill means you should have paid a lot more than $200 (especially with tip).", "NTA. That is bullshit. Your wife want to look like a baller? She should pay with her own money.", "Why are men always the ones who have to pay when modern society says we are all equal? Fuck that old world belief. Especially paying for your wife's friends.", "NTA, I\u2019m glad you took a stand and didn\u2019t allow them to pressure you into something you did not agree too. \n\nThis happened to me once 4 years ago with my lady and her friend on Valentine\u2019s Day, she got dumped the day before and my lady wanted to be nice and included her in our plans without informing me. \n\nAfter we got home, in a calm and jokingly tone, I said I have no problem paying for your friend, but next time I pay for another friend without prior warning, I hope she plays with my Johnson a little.\nNever dealt with that issue ever again.\n\nI definitely suggest communicating with your partner and see how she would\u2019ve felt if the roles were reversed and you brought friends to your house unexpectedly, and then expected her to cook dinner for everyone. I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019d be happy to do that. Also, it might be time to make new friends if they are making fun of her because her husband isn\u2019t a tool.

In this instance, you're teaching your wife that you aren't just her wallet.  Good job.", "NTA. This dinner was your wife's idea. If she expected you to pay for all her friends, she should have told you that before you went out, not put you on the spot once you got there. This is really disgusting behavior.

Either the post is fake or you married an unhinged and an idiot. How didn't you notice she's that crazy before actually marrying her?

She got a free meal didn't she? I guess her friends are more important to her than the husband in these situations which isn't very fair.

We will usually split the total cost between us because we are a partnership and we both have jobs (different story obviously for large pay differences or for SAHP).

If your wife is wealthy, or makes more money than you, then play along. Anyway, she should've discussed with you way in advance. If she didn't discuss with you, then my vote is ESH. If you both really had discussed this, there's always better options than a fancy steakhouse to show off your money. If you make less money than her and she were to see how you'd feel, you guys can have oysters, sushi, or Korean food, etc... Elegant and delicious food doesn't need to just be expensive alone.

Sides run between $14-16. Appetizers are $18-25. Desserts are $12-15. So just with FOOD it's easy to get to $100 per person and more.

Oh, and probably details about how she's gained weight and/or doesn't put out or is cheating.", "Her sexist attempts at manipulation.....", "> We all eat and my wife slides the bill (700+) and proceeds to say. \u201cThe man should  always pay for the wife and her friends.\u201d\n\nThis is totally rediculous.  Unless it was discussed and agreed upon betwwen OP and his wife before hand.  It appears that only the wife told her friends that OP would be paying for everyone.  You had no idea that was coming and rightfully just paid for you and your wife.\n\nThen she screams at you for not paying the full bill??  She is projecting because she is embarrassed that she told her friends you'd pay, but then was shocked it didn't go over well with you.\n\nYou don't put your SO on the spot at the restaurant with a $700 bill and just expect him to pay.  That's absurd!!!\n\nNTA", "\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04", "Yes, but that\u2019s how I was raised\u2026if I invite someone, to ANYTHING, I pay for the thing, and same if they invite me. So if I invite you to dinner, I will pay for your dinner. \n\n\nThat doesn\u2019t say anything about other expenses though. If, for example, I was invited to a movie, I don\u2019t expect them to foot the bill for anything other than the ticket, \u201cthe movie,\u201d and I always offer the get their snacks, \u201csince they got the tickets,\u201d and do pay for my own.", "The friends are fuckheads too because they proceeded to ridicule him and insult him with \u201cbroke husband\u201d.", "Dude that would be insane \ud83d\ude02", "He shouldn't have paid for her is what I'm saying, he should have paid for his food, plus some for a tip and left.", "Not necessarily sexist. Well I was making $20,000 a year and living in Chicago and paying off a $300,000 School loan, my older sister, who lives in mexico, promised some people that I would allow two Mexican doctors to live in my house for free.\n\nProblem was, I lived in one single room. It was a three bedroom apartment and I had one of the bedrooms. Being in chicago, it wasn't a very large apartment.\n\nWhen I let my sister know that that wasn't possible she starts screaming at me. She had already promised people that I would do it.  I was amazed at how angry she was.\n\n Then a few years later I went to visit my younger sister. She had promised the people where she work that I would do free psychiatric evaluations for their clients. I\n\nI pointed out that I was not licensed in her state. She just blew up at me, saying she was going to be embarrassed at work because she had promised I would do it.\n\nAfter she calmed down a bit I pointed out that if she would have asked me first I could have told her that it was impossible and then she wouldn't be embarrassed.\n\nShe hung up on me.\n\nSo it's not necessarily sexist behavior. It is just straight up bullying. People with more power get away with bullying more that's why it seems sexist. Because men have more power in our society than women, men are more likely to get away with bullying women than they are with bullying another man if their same status.", "Agreed. The friends suck just as much here. Why would they even think this man was paying for their dinner. I wouldn\u2019t expect someone else to pay for me at a diner, let alone a (presumably) expensive restaurant. \n\nAnd then calling him cheap? These seem like the type of women that expect to be pampered and spoiled. If OP isn\u2019t into that sort of thing, he should cut ties with her now because this behavior will only get worse"]}
