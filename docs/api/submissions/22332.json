You do sound a bit controlling though, I don't know what's up with how you raise your kids word for word, but from what i read, i think you see your kids more like property or trophies, which can be really hurtful to young kids and teenagers.

Judge never ordered visitation and these aren't HIS relatives and he clearly does not like or respect them, but he sends them **every weekend** for stayovers? That's a lot even if you have a great relationship with them. Also makes me wonder - is he allowing visitation with his ex's family primarily as a way to dangle the kids in front of his ex? The parents clearly talk to her about the kids.\n\nPlenty of people do get full custody, but in my experience those who brag about it in this \"look how awful the other parent is, the fact that I got full custody proves it!\" way are usually abusive. Men who are accused of domestic violence statistically get custody at higher rates. It's not like the judge is like \"oh, he's abusive, sounds like a great dad!\", it's just that vulnerability begets abuse, and it's not unusual that a DV victim has enough vulnerabilities that make them subject to abuse, that they also aren't capable of providing. A woman fleeing a DV situation might not get custody because the situation has left her homeless, without income, etc.", "That and the text sent. YTA vibes.
