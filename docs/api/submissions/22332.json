The parents clearly talk to her about the kids.\n\nPlenty of people do get full custody, but in my experience those who brag about it in this \"look how awful the other parent is, the fact that I got full custody proves it!\" way are usually abusive. Men who are accused of domestic violence statistically get custody at higher rates. It's not like the judge is like \"oh, he's abusive, sounds like a great dad!\", it's just that vulnerability begets abuse, and it's not unusual that a DV victim has enough vulnerabilities that make them subject to abuse, that they also aren't capable of providing.
