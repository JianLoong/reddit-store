But is that the type of person you\u2019d want to be with?", "Also, that's not cheap. I get that shoes are insanely expensive nowadays, but that's still a hefty amount to just pull out. Maybe I'm stingier than I thought, but isn't that the case? Not disagreeing with you, just wondering if the GF didn't feel guilty about owing OP that much money out of nowhere (Like, in a single purchase, I don't mean to make it sound like it is an insane amount, but I'd feel guilty if I owed someone that much).", "I see why that thing about the bills was misleading but to be clear I\u2019m not paying any of her bills.

It was too expensive, but could he pay half pleeeease? Heart of gold, he agreed. Then whoops, her card declined on her half, can he get it and she'll pay him back next pay day? Of course he agreed. \n\n\nSpoiler, she didn't pay him back the half. Christmas comes around, he gives it to her as a gift anyway (I'm eye rolling as I type this) and she doesn't even remember to get him a gift!!

People like your girlfriend are notorious at taking out money in loans from people and establishments only to make a game of dodging their creditors. Expect this to be just how she behaves forever and consider whether that noise is worth your time.", "NTA   DUMP her she is not worth the hassle", "NTA she bought a Nintendo switch it\u2019s not like she used the last of her money on essentials or an emergency expense she knew what she was doing.  Dump this narcissist and count your blessings", "This is why Venmo and Zelle exist. NTA. She never intended to pay you back.", "NTA. If she really needs the cash she can return the switch and buy it back when she can afford it.", "Yep, this right here. Time to move on. But also why one should NEVER date a co-worker", "If he said, that's ok, it's on me. Then it's a gift.  She agreed to pay him back, and as a female, she makes  us all look bad.", "Just friendly advise for this or the next relationship: pay half of the dates and let her pay the other half. $40 a week is $2080 a year, you could spend it on a very nice all inclusive vacation, if you would save the $1040 she consumes.", "NTA and if she wants to threaten you with a break up, agree to it. She wasn't ever planning on paying you back, she's very comfortable lying to you, and she's both entitled and greedy. Adults (and Lannisters) pay their debts. You can do better.", "so she has a history of not paying you back and also threatened to break up with you bc of said payment. personally, I think its time to leave her in the dust. NTA", "NTA. She promised to pay you back, the two of you made an agreement that she would pay you back, then she reneged immediately after spending most of her paycheck on discretionary purchases. It's not like she had an unexpected emergency that wiped out her bank account, which would be an understandable circumstance for an extension. You also said this isn't the first time she's stiffed you. Do you see how obvious it is that she never intended to pay you back for the shoes? And instead of apologizing to you for breaking her promise after you held her to it, she doubled down and threatened your entire relationship over $60.\n\nSo... some major red flags here. Her words and actions show that she is a liar, she lacks integrity, she lacks any sense of fiscal responsibility, and she is willing to manipulate the people she supposedly cares about to get what she wants. 19 is old enough that you really can't excuse her decisions based on her age, and she is increasingly less likely to change the older she gets.\n\nRarely would I ever recommend that someone cut a person out of their life, but if what you shared here is the full and accurate truth, you need to break things off with her ASAP, then run, don't walk, the other way. She will leech off of you for as long as she can, until she has pulled you down and ruined your life, before moving on to someone else that she can fool.", "NTA. She bought herself a Switch, and yet couldn't pay you back $60. She doesn't even pay her own bills, and then threatened to break up with you. Do yourself a favor and breakup first. In today's age, you don't forget your wallet, unless you're intending to make someone else pay for you.", "NTA.  Now she's threatening to break up with you?  Absurd.  This is a definite red flag.  She has a history of not paying you back, so maybe you should stop lending her money.  If you continue to lend money, that would make you TA.   She needs to understand that it was a loan for the day, not for a week & a half.  And that paying you back is more important than getting her toys.  She needs to grow up & take responsibility.", "Do you love her or something?", "She is nineteen. Teen is in there. Date someone that is more adult. She bought a switch and games and yet didn\u2019t want to pay you back when she has no responsibility. NTA but you will be if you continue", "She is nineteen. Teen is in there. Date someone that is more adult. She bought a switch and games and yet didn\u2019t want to pay you back when she has no responsibility. NTA but you will be if you continue", "Yea I think that\u2019s the biggest problem really", "That has nothing to do with it?", "She spent almost $600 in three days, on stuff that sounds completely unnecessary (i.e., not bills/food). That sounds more than a little bad with money to me. If this is how she\u2019s acting when they aren\u2019t even living together I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like if they did and suddenly she was responsible for half the bills. Imo, OP needs to get out now while he can, because this will likely only get worse.", "Sure it does. They work together. If they break up, they still \nhave to work together. That will be uncomfortable at best.", "Very true"]}
