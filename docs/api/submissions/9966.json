My wife, \"Sarah\", has learned to process these things with grace, which I appreciate.

A very common tactic for her is to \"fake\"-whine that she's *not welcome here! I guess I'll just go outside!* With the obvious implication that we need to comfort her and tell her that she is welcome. \n\n(I suspect she has some abandonment issues. IANAtherapist.)\n\nAgain, my wife has learned to deal with this over her lifetime. It's \"just the way mom is\". Which is fine! I hate it and it is manipulative garbage, but I might do the same thing. \n\nMy wife and I bought our first home last year so we hosted Christmas. This is MIL's first time being a guest instead of the host, so I knew we'd need to be patient with her. She's out of control of the situation, that's hard. \n\nWell, it was Christmas dinner cooking time. Our kitchen can be generously referred to as *efficient*, and I was cooking for 12 people while Sarah played host. And my MIL found every excuse to park herself in my way as I was trying to roast a goose and make five sides. I had to ask her several times to move just to find space to chop.\n\nFinally, this exchange (recalled as exactly as I can) occurred:\n\n>me: hey mom, you can just go hang in the living room with everyone else. I got this!\n\n>>her: *oh I get it, I'm not welcome here!* [imagine this in \"fake\" drama tone]\n\n>me: well, yeah, but I figured it would be rude to say it like that. \n\nI think she was mad I didn't play along, because the facade dropped instantly. she said \"fine\" and went back to the other group.

Then next time she pulls this \"ohhhh I'm not welcome\" bullshit (which she will) you say \"I'm not playing this game with you anymore.

When I\u2019m cooking, I prefer to do it solo and without any distractions because I get in my groove and unable to provide you with attention.
