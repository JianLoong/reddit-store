It is not a right for anyone to be there, rather less if she's barging in there and not even helping in a way you ask her to.", "NTA.\n\nAlso... hilarious.  Good comeback.", ">It's \"just the way mom is\"\n\nWell, this is It's \"just the way you are\", so they should be perfectly okay with learning to live with you this way.\n\n>A very common tactic for her is to \"fake\"-whine that she's not welcome here! I guess I'll just go outside! With the obvious implication that we need to comfort her and tell her that she is welcome.\r  \n\r  \n(I suspect she has some abandonment issues. IANAtherapist.)\n\nThis is not abandonment issues, this is manipulation, plain and simple.\n\nNTA, and - \n\n>[Don't rock the boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimFamilySolutions/comments/di7npz/this_analogy_is_incredible_do_read_it/).\r  \n\r  \nI've been thinking about this phrase a lot lately, about how unfair it is. Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\r  \n\r  \nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\r  \n\r  \nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\r  \n\r  \nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\r  \n\r  \nBallast!\r  \n\r  \nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\r  \n\r  \nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .\r  \n\r  \nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\r  \n\r  \nNow you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.\r  \n\r  \nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\r  \n\r  \nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.\r  \n\r  \nYou know what would be easier? If they all just chucked the bitch overboard.\r  \n\r  \nThank you for letting me ramble. Thanks for the support, and advice, and humour. Thanks for just being here :)\n\nYou did not give in to her manipulation, and she's still upset about it.", "NTA. Your kitchen. You'd been ok to say worse.
