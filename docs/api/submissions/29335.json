He's never taken responsibility for himself and has always done whatever he wants to without thinking about other people. \r  \n\r  \nA few years ago, my grandfather passed away and both me and Jake inherited some money. I put mine in a savings account and planned to use it for college in the future (I'm working in my Dad's carpentry business at the moment). Jake had just finished high school and he decided to blow all the money on a gap year travelling to Thailand and Vietnam and who knows where else. As the months go by, we hear less and less from him. We all thought he would at least come back for Christmas but he doesn't even do that. A year turns into two. He told us he was deleting  all his social media accounts to \"really live in the moment\". One day his phone number stops working. Just goes straight to voice-mail. With no permanent address and no social media we had literally no way of contacting him. He could have been dead in a ditch for all we knew. \r  \n\r  \nThat was eight months ago. Last Thursday, totally out of the blue, Jake shows up on our doorstep. Turns out he blew all the money on parties and hookers in the first six months. Then started working odd jobs to get by. Eventually he turned to petty crime but ended up homeless on the streets of Laos. Don't ask me how he managed to scrape enough money together for the plane ticket home. I honestly don't want to know. \r  \n\r  \nSo what does my dad do when my irresponsible jerk of a brother who let us think he was dead shows his wretched face? \r  \n\r  \nMy dad threw him a party. My dad - who wouldn't so much as buy food for a BBQ with my friends for my birthday - threw this tosser a huge party. And he took him shopping and bought him designer trainers. He even got him a brand new iPhone.\r  \n\r  \nSo this is where I might be the asshole. I absolutely snapped at both of them. I said some rather choice words that while unkind were not untrue. I slammed the door in my dad's face when he tried to invite me to the \"homecoming\" party. Now, neither he nor my brother will speak to me. My mum keeps trying to get us to make up. I'd written my brother off as a lost cause but I honestly don't understand how my parents can reward his selfish behaviour. I've literally been working for my dad for years without so much as a pat on the back. \r  \n\r  \nSo reddit AITA? \r  \n", "created_utc": 1697822798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cgmqh/aita_for_shouting_at_my_dad_for_throwing_a_party/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You seem to resent that he came back alive.", "Brother,\n\nYTA\n\nYTu were the asshole from the very beginning.\n\nLet's start with the fact that your brother is also your dads son. What did you want your dad to do? kick him out and denounce him as a son? WTF? That's his son. Ofcourse he is going to celebrate the return of his son that has been gone for several years. That's a pretty natural reaction. A fathers love for his son is eternal. Something that you may understand one day when you have children. The love is different. I had never experienced a love like when I had my children. It's a pure, sincere, and virtuous love. They could want me dead and I would still forgive them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour brother did what he wanted to do with his money. In my experience, traveling is a phenomenal way to develop culture. I had a similar situation happen to me when I turned 18 and I took the opportunity to backpack Europe for 3 months. 15 years later and I still reminisce on my experience. It changed me as a person. It's something to experience. Its life. It's the world. Just because he doesn't want to follow your traditional view of how a life should go, doesn't mean his decision is wrong. He explored, probably discovered himself. He sounds like he has overcome adversity and hardship as well. These qualities you cant teach in a classroom. And it has great carryover to the real world.\n\nAnd from what I understand, it's been years since your dad has bought your son anything. Im pretty sure if you calculate the values, you would have extracted much more value from your dad than him. Your dad gave you a job and allowed you some work experience. Im sure your dad has bought you many things. But you fixate on the instance that he didn't give you what you wanted and used that as an example. That's pretty spoiled behavior. It shows that you don't recognize the value that your parents bestow on you. Maybe it's time to do some introspection and think to yourself how much your parents have contributed to your life.\n\nMaybe you need to welcome your brother back with open arms and embrace that he went on a journey of self discovery. Not a decision that you would have made, but something that he was able to make from himself.\n\nStop being so damn jealous and itemizing how much your parents give you and your brother. Get your hands out of your dads pockets, Its gross.", "YTA. Your dad probably thought your brother was dead so you shouldn't be angry that your dad is happy to see him.\n\nAs a side note: Jake sounds like a total badass.", "This is a lovely updated retelling of the Prodigal Son. NAH, per Jesus", "YTA. Your dad lost one of his child for YEARS, and got him back. OF COURSE he is going to welcome him and celebrate his return. What did you expect ?\n\nYour brother made life choices for himself. You don't have to approve of them : it's not your life.", "NAH, except your brother.  I understand why it would bother you that someone who has been irresponsible (and sounds like a jerk)  is being rewarded, but perhaps your parents  are just relieved that he\u2019s alive after not hearing from him for two years.", "NTA", "I always thought the story of the prodigal son in the bible was stupid and this post is just another example. As a parent I understand being overjoyed to see your wandering child return but as a sibling I totally get the resentment. NTA.", "NTA for feeling neglected and jealous that after everything you have done, and your continuous good behaviour , the son who did the opposite is rewarded. I get it!! Your father however, is celebrating the return of his son that for a while he most likely thought was dead. If your parents have continuously shown favouritism to your brother then you can't be shocked by this. If they haven't, then honestly they are probably just so grateful to have him back alive* that they want to celebrate that. You were definitely not wrong to be upset, but I also get where your dad is coming from. I hope like the parable your brother learnt from his mistakes and if there has always been favouritism then I hope for your sake that you take this as the sign to start living for you.

Really appeals to the argument because it debases the brother and makes what they did seem deplorable. When in reality, it was probably nowhere near as extreme as that.
