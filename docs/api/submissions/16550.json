I told her no and to please drop it, to which Jane replied with \u2018it\u2019s been over six years, you need to get over it and move on\u2019.

In your shoes, I would contact them via group text and say just that\u2026that they have continued in trying to force you into what they want and made you uncomfortable over and over.

That's different for everyone.\n\nI do wonder how Jane's children from her first marriage handled her remarrying a year after their father died.  From many posts here, it seems clear that a lot of children are not ready to \"move on\" that quickly when a parent dies, and not having enough time to mourn and recover can lead to resentment of both the surviving parent and the stepparent, plus any half or step siblings.  \n\nIf Jane's kids are not comfortable with her \"moving on\" as quickly as she did, and feel they were expect to accept a stepfather and half-siblings before they are ready, she may see your taking your time  as a silent criticism of her decision, and the kids might point to you as someone who has given their children the time they need.  \n\nI suspect the whole thing is much more complicated than just the two of you having different speeds at which you are comfortable \"moving on.\"", "NTA\n\nYou made that comment after a long stream of inappropriate comments from your sister.

I'm married and my husband and I are both aware our love is not huge or life altering. Like, we have love and are committed to our family, but it's not a big romantic thing if that makes sense. I'm pretty confident we would both move on eventually if the other passed. Whereas I know two women who experienced what you described. Ones my SIL and the other was my Grandma. For my SIL it's been almost a decade and her love is still her husband. My Grandma survived my Grandpa for twenty five years and never remarried. She was so in love with him even til the day she died.\n\nIt's not that your sister didn't love her husband ofcourse. But I think that kind of epic, life altering love is a rare thing. And I think it deserves respect.\n\nIt's possible your sister pushes it so much out of some misplaced guilt for moving on. Possibly your comment played on an already existing insecurity - but she was still way out of line.\n\n\nYour sister had every right to move on - just like you have every right to hold on to that wonderful love you shared. Both are valid and should be supported.", "Its none of their business and she singled you out first.  If she didn't want to take it, she shouldn't dish it.

They keep pushing their own ideas on to you, and that's not love. That's control. Even if they think they have your best interests at heart, that doesn't matter because they are ignoring the words coming out of your mouth.
