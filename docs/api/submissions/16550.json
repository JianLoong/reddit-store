I'm pretty confident we would both move on eventually if the other passed. Whereas I know two women who experienced what you described. Ones my SIL and the other was my Grandma. For my SIL it's been almost a decade and her love is still her husband. My Grandma survived my Grandpa for twenty five years and never remarried. She was so in love with him even til the day she died.\n\nIt's not that your sister didn't love her husband ofcourse. But I think that kind of epic, life altering love is a rare thing.

They probably just want to see you happy again and want what's best for you and your family.

The fact that you have drifted away from them probably added to that, as depressed people tend to pull away from their loved ones.\n\nIDK if you ever sat down to discuss this with them, or if you just said you're not interested in response to their comments and in a way that might have been perceived by them as potentially defensive. I think you should get your family together to calmly explain to them how much what they're doing is hurting you, that this is your decision and if they wish to continue to have a relationship with you, they need to be respectful of that.\n\nNow, on to the incident with your sister. No one has the right to dictate how fast someone else moves on, or what they do to get over their loss. Your sister doesn't have the right to judge you for choosing not to date, and you don't get to judge her for choosing to remarry relatively soon, which sounds like you do, tbh. She definitely shouldn't have made that comment, but the way you responded doesn't necessarily make you look better. It would have been ok if you hadn't thrown the timeframe in her face.

It sounds like you and OP both might need to go back to therapy.", "For some reason the family thinks it is fine to endlessly shame OP.", "It is cruel isn't it?

It's interesting how everyone is worried about you shaming Jane, but no one stood up when she shamed you for not moving on. They need to mind their business.", "Honestly, I feel like Jane might be putting so much pressure on because she feels like OP is making her look bad for getting remarried before grass even had the chance to grow on her husband's grave for more than a season. Rest of the family is probably feeling it, too. \n\nWhich makes it worse because then they aren't being AH because they want OP to be happy. They just want any awkward appearances to stop. \n\nNTA.", "I feel like the fact that OP hasn't remarried is what \"shames\" Jane (somehow, in her mind?)\n\nIt seems like Jane wants /u/Best-Quantity-9059 to remarry/find another partner for some weird reason when it's none of her business whatsoever, and that is all I can come up with.", "This reminds me of a guy who posted a while ago about his brother demanding he move on from losing his wife already. His brother felt like he was clinging to a fantasy after losing his wife so young (in mid-twenties if I remember right.) \n\nLike him, OP deserves the right to make decisions for her life. Its not her family's life that will be affected. Its her and her kids. In time she MIGHT decide to try dating but she might never want to and that timeline is entirely up to her and no one else.", "Yeah, I mean, was she already swiping right on dating apps during his funeral?", "OP didn't really dunk on Jane's choice though, she just stated that it happened. There's no real value judgement in her wording", "If Jane didn\u2019t want OP to point out that she had gotten over it and moved on then she shouldn\u2019t have told OP to get over it and move on. Jane dunked on her own choice, OP just repeated it.", "I absolutely agree. I think most of this argument is about Jane. I wonder how much of the push is about Jane too where it flipped from Jane married too fast to why won't OP marry again like Jane did (never mind the problems that caused) because OP's kids have had more time to deal or some similar notion.", "I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to call someone an AH for giving back what they receive.

Family probably feels the same.", "I think both Jane and OP have perfectly valid reactions to losing a partner (though I am a bit wary at how quickly she remarried, especially with kids that just lost their dad). Perhaps Jane has a a nagging feeling that she moved on too quickly (or moved on at all), and OP is a reminder of that insecurity.", "Too many people don't accept that a person can be single and happy or even want to stay single. So many people in good or bad faith think you need a partner to be whole. That's absolutely false, and I've gotten so sick of it. \n\nI'm currently engaged, but my parents could not accept when I was single and just wanted to be focused on myself and my studies. They insisted I needed a partner to be happy. Now they're doing the same to my brother because he broke a long-term relationship. \n\nThey've never been apart and are incapable of being alone. They are very dependent on each other, so they really struggle to understand how okay or healthy it is to be alone and fine with it. \n\nIn fact, my mom gives me shit for not being a crying nervous mess when my SO goes on a weekend trip for work or with his friends. I do miss him, but I'm excited to be completely alone in my home. It's a rare occasion, and I like to devolve for a bit lol\n\nIn fact, that's one of the main reasons I wasn't ready to be in a relationship.

It took my sister years to accept that I meant it when I said I had no interest in dating again.", "This is a generous point of view but I still disagree with  it. I think it\u2019s unhealthy to need a partner to be happy, and anyone with that kind of attitude is more likely to make bad choices in relationships just for the sake of not being alone.

So it was cruel if you to shame Jane but it\u2019s okay for her to shame you?   \n\nMoving on and dating again are not the same thing. You can have moved on and accepted your late husbands death and still not date again. As long as his absence hasn\u2019t halted your life you have \u201cmoved on\u201d. You can live a happy and fulfilling life without a romantic partner. \nIt sounds to me that Jane never actually dealt with her husbands death or she was only married because she wanted to be married not because he was the love of her life.

That one line really spoke to me too.", "you hit the nail on the head on trying to detract the spotlight from jane bouncing back so quickly. my grandmother was widowed at 43 and hasn't dated anyone since. she's 82 now and still wears her wedding ring, and that's totally fine. NTA, op", "> but in that moment, you chose not to respect her choice, either. \n\nI think the time frame is important. You're not wrong, but she respected it for 6 years while constantly being put down herself. Most people wouldn't last 6 years of disrespect without ever snapping back once.", "Glad this is here, too bad it\u2019s downvoted. I agree bc she\u2019s shaming her sister just the same way she is being shamed. The only difference is that a group of people agree with shaming her and not her sister. I feel for her in that sense but the point she\u2019s making is a bit hypocritical. \n\nI still don\u2019t agree with the family ganging up on her so i agree a good way to deal with it is to let them know they can either stop or just not see her anymore", "Dude... six years of this shit and you think she doesn't get a pass?

I lost my husband six months ago, and thankfully no one in my family has broached the subject of finding someone else (though many other people have, much to my annoyance).  My husband was my one big love too, and I cannot imagine being with anyone else, nor even wanting to.

That seems extremely soon to me, and shows a definite lack of loyalty to his memory and their relationship, imo. It was also an insult to his children, again imo, though OP said they were quite upset about it.

We are highschool sweethearts and grew up together. We have had our ups and downs, but he is the absolute love of my life. No one would even compare and honestly I wouldn't want anyone else. If he died I would be single the rest of my life. Dating again seems like a personal hell. Hook up culture? HELL NO.", "Moving on doesn't necessarily mean dating again though. If my mother passed away I wouldn't move on by finding a new mom. It's a false equivalency that a lot of people have that moving on from a breakup or death of a spouse means you have to find a new one.", "To be honest it sounds to me like OPs sister just immediately needed another husband to help with raising her kids. I've seen this with widowed men who get a new wife pretty fast to help raise the kids, and wouldn't be surprised if Jane was doing the same. I also just remembered my own aunt did this. Her husband died young and then she married his brother not long after because she didn't work and basically needed someone to help with her kids (they also had 2 kids of their own). Needless to say though that family had a lot of drama, although most of it was the kids being pissed off when my aunt divorced this husband years later because he had a bad drinking problem, not them upset she remarried.", "Yeah, I personally can't picture myself getting into a relationship so soon, but if someone does i don't think that says anything about how much they loved their partner. Even if something isn't for you, we shouldn't impose those expectations on someone else, particularly in a circumstance like this where there's nothing morally wrong with it. It's not cheating. For all we know, the extra support could have been beneficial in her healing and helping her and her kids feel like they weren't abandoned.\n\nWe also shouldn't make assumptions about the kids. It totally depends on the circumstance. I imagine some kids would really hate the idea of their mom dating, while others would be sad to see their mom be alone and would appreciate having another father figure.

It's making the choice of how you intend to live the rest of your life. \n\nJane chose to marry again. Valid choice. OP has decided that no other man could fill her husband's place, so she chooses to focus on her children and their life together. Also a valid choice.

MY husband died six months ago, and less than two months later people were telling me not to worry, I'll find someone else.  WTF?

Many are completely happy with their other relationships. What year will it be when people understand that??", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. People truly suck", "From what OP said Jane's kids, understandably, didn't take too well to their mother dating someone mere months after their fathers passing, while they were still in the process of grieving. My bet is that the family, at some level, feel uncomfortable with it, but don't want to cause conflict with Jane and her new partner. OP remarrying as well would reinforce that Jane was \"right\", so they go with it. \n\nThat's my two cents anyway, I'm not a psychologist, and even if I was, I'm not their psychologist.", "This is different, though \u2014 it\u2019s common for people who are insecure about their actions to try to push others into following suit, to validate them. That doesn\u2019t make someone\u2019s personal choices into unintentional criticism that they need to learn not to do.", "That's pretty good analysis from an non-psychologist. \n\nWe do see a lot of people justifying their choices by pressuring people to make identical choices.", "No I agree with you, but I'm making the point that despite not trying to be, and being right, you can still be the asshole unintentionally.", "This isn\u2019t one of those times"]}
