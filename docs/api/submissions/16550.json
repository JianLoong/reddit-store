I'm pretty confident we would both move on eventually if the other passed. Whereas I know two women who experienced what you described. Ones my SIL and the other was my Grandma. For my SIL it's been almost a decade and her love is still her husband. My Grandma survived my Grandpa for twenty five years and never remarried. She was so in love with him even til the day she died.\n\nIt's not that your sister didn't love her husband ofcourse. But I think that kind of epic, life altering love is a rare thing.
