Your current attitude must make her feel invalidated.\n\nJust from my observation, the newer generations are much more attentive and proactive regarding mental health. I'm kind of in the middle so I'm exposed to both sides a lot. My mom is almost 70. When I was growing up, she would constantly say things like \"wait till you have actual problems\" or \"that's nothing, when I was your age blahblahblah\" kinda similar to your words in that it just washes over the problem.\n\nI eventually told her that it's invalidating/condescending and doesn't help when she says those things because even though I know I'll probably have more important issues when I'm older, currently these are The Biggest Problems of my life and I'm learning to navigate them so that hopefully future problems will be easier to deal with as well.\n\nShe understood it. She stopped being so dismissive of my issues and instead learned to listen and offer appropriate advice based on her own experiences, and I consider her one of my best friends now because she actually takes the time to consider me.\n\nSometimes we can't help how we react, and your daughter has stress that's now manifesting into physical symptoms.

Well you're not very helpful, are you ?", "YTA, but I get where you're coming from.\n\nMy mom was the same way.I've dealt with anxiety and panic attacks for the majority of my life. I was always nervous. In my 20's, it hit extra hard. I went from just being internal anxious to presenting physical symptoms from the repeated trauma I was putting myself through being on-edge at all times.The entire time that was happening, my mom kept telling me to just \"get out of my head\", \"take up a hobby\", \"get more sleep\", \"just stop overthinking\", etc. This went on for long enough that I stopped telling her when things were wrong with me. I stopped trusting that she'd support me when I needed it the most. She was right, to a degree, that I did need to get out of my head. I needed to learn coping skills and ways to work with and understand where the anxiety was coming from. The last thing I need to be told was that I should just stop panicking.\n\nAbout a decade after I stopped going to her for support, right in the middle of covid, my mom has a heart attack. She has now spent the last two years an absolute nervous wreck. I've helped talked her down during panic attacks, chatted with her late into the night to make sure she is okay, helped work with her on developing coping skills while encouraging her to seek out someone to talk to so that she can start to unpack the trauma of almost dying. Never once in these 2 years have I told her that she just needs to get out of her head and stop overthinking. It took a little while, but she finally said that if she had known that this was anywhere close to how I felt all those years ago, she would have never once said the things that she said.\n\nIt can be really hard to understand where another person is coming from when you aren't someone that has the anxiety brain. If she could just step away from it all, I promise your daughter would. For now, as her mom, the best thing you can do is help her take her mind off things. Be her support. Don't just tell her to get out of her head, see if she wants to spend time together. See if she wants to see a movie, take a walk, something. If she wants to talk about it, just let her talk. Don't offer advice. Just listen. She needs your emotional support.", "This is giving me these kind of vibes \u201cOh are you depressed?

You were indeed dismissive, and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you've probably not had to deal with long term mental illness. Your post and the response to your daughter REEKS of ignorance and an unwillingness to try to learn and understand. \n\nPeople with mental health issues KNOW often deeply in their bones that their issues are in their head. But here's the thing, your head is a part of your body, your brain is an organ same as your stomach, lungs, kidneys etc. The thing is, the brain is the epicenter of the body, so it's no surprise that extreme mental distress, stress, and burnout will cause physical symptoms. For example, I will get horrifically physically sick if I'm anxious/stressed out past a certain point. \n\nIn this initial reaction you are indeed the A-hole. \nGoing forward, show some compassion. The worst things you can say are \"It could be so much worse, think about XYZ worse things\" we know. \"It's all in your head\" we know. \"Just snap out of it. What do you have to be so stressed about\" we can't. You can GENTLY suggest therapy and/or medication. But it is NOT your place to dismiss and belittle their symptoms because you don't get it, haven't experienced it, or just don't want to educate yourself about what she's dealing with.\n\nLast thing I'll say in this novella, your child sounds like a gifted kid and they are trying to plow through higher and post graduate education. That's a lot and those that do it are prone to burnout and developing anxiety disorders among other mental issues.

I was doing this to myself and needed to \u201csnap out of it\u201d. Then I had a screaming breakdown. \n\nI was in so much physical and mental pain. One of my girlfriends called my mom who was out grocery shopping at the time; she told my mom that I was breaking down and they couldn\u2019t figure out how to calm me down. My mom turned the car around, got on the highway\u2014ice cream, raw meat and all\u2014and drove 4 hours from my hometown to my university town to be with me. Seeing her daughter, break down the way I did, made her realize that this wasn\u2019t something I could control. After that, she became my biggest mental health advocate.\n\nRight now, YTA. Hell, my mother was the asshole. Until then, my mother had always been the person who thought \u201cthe brain can fix itself\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s stressing herself into a panic.\u201d But she did a complete 180. Most people don\u2019t change their beliefs in a lifetime; my mother did in months.\n\nIt\u2019s 8 years later, and any time I feel like life is getting to be too much or I\u2019m about to break down, I think about her swinging her car around, with the groceries sweating, and driving those 4 hours to be with me; just knowing she\u2019s there sometimes makes all the difference.

Anxiety is irrational. We KNOW it's all in our head and irrational. But we physically cannot stop worrying. It is a chemical imbalance in our brains. It's not possible to just 'stop worrying'. She needs therapy, support and medication to manage this. Not you telling her to suck it up. YTA. Huge. Massive.

I\u2019ve stressed myself into chest pains and anxiety attacks and even into the ER and I constantly live in my own head.  It cripples me.  I was professionally diagnosed with OCD years ago, as well as generalized anxiety, and after the doctors and therapists explained OCD, my mum said she wished she\u2019d known earlier as a lot of things I did or would be particular about as a child suddenly made sense.

I think you meant well, but she might not know *how* to not be in her head, so just telling her to stop isn\u2019t actually helpful.  I still haven\u2019t figured it out.  I lived years in my own head\u2014how am I supposed to stop now?\n\nYes, you\u2019re right.  Just because it\u2019s upsetting and she doesn\u2019t like it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.  But after a certain point you need to start offering solutions instead of just repeating the same thing.  Work with your daughter to help identity and ease stressors.  My OCD is incredibly schedule-oriented and I\u2019m liable to completely lock down and fugue for a bit, or I\u2019ll get hysterical.  Knowing what the stressor is and the cause, however, has helped me manage it.  I\u2019ll still get upset, but I know why so I don\u2019t feel crazy, and knowing it will pass helps.\n\nWork with your daughter, OP.

I was diagnosed with panic disorder and mild situational depression. I started medication and behavior therapy for when panic attacks kicked in. It's not as simple as \"stop worrying\". You can logically tell yourself to calm down all you want but your parasympathetic system has other plans. It took me a ton of work to get it under control.

Therapy and medication can help, but it\u2019s all about learning coping mechanisms - talking yourself off the ledge. Her brain lies to her all the time. \u2018Over-thinking\u2019 isn\u2019t a choice she\u2019s making, it\u2019s an automatic response to stimuli that sends her flight reflex into overdrive.
