Well you're not very helpful, are you ?", "YTA, but I get where you're coming from.\n\nMy mom was the same way.I've dealt with anxiety and panic attacks for the majority of my life. I was always nervous. In my 20's, it hit extra hard. I went from just being internal anxious to presenting physical symptoms from the repeated trauma I was putting myself through being on-edge at all times.The entire time that was happening, my mom kept telling me to just \"get out of my head\", \"take up a hobby\", \"get more sleep\", \"just stop overthinking\", etc. This went on for long enough that I stopped telling her when things were wrong with me. I stopped trusting that she'd support me when I needed it the most. She was right, to a degree, that I did need to get out of my head. I needed to learn coping skills and ways to work with and understand where the anxiety was coming from. The last thing I need to be told was that I should just stop panicking.\n\nAbout a decade after I stopped going to her for support, right in the middle of covid, my mom has a heart attack. She has now spent the last two years an absolute nervous wreck. I've helped talked her down during panic attacks, chatted with her late into the night to make sure she is okay, helped work with her on developing coping skills while encouraging her to seek out someone to talk to so that she can start to unpack the trauma of almost dying. Never once in these 2 years have I told her that she just needs to get out of her head and stop overthinking. It took a little while, but she finally said that if she had known that this was anywhere close to how I felt all those years ago, she would have never once said the things that she said.\n\nIt can be really hard to understand where another person is coming from when you aren't someone that has the anxiety brain. If she could just step away from it all, I promise your daughter would. For now, as her mom, the best thing you can do is help her take her mind off things. Be her support. Don't just tell her to get out of her head, see if she wants to spend time together. See if she wants to see a movie, take a walk, something. If she wants to talk about it, just let her talk. Don't offer advice. Just listen. She needs your emotional support.", "This is giving me these kind of vibes \u201cOh are you depressed?

You were indeed dismissive, and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you've probably not had to deal with long term mental illness. Your post and the response to your daughter REEKS of ignorance and an unwillingness to try to learn and understand. \n\nPeople with mental health issues KNOW often deeply in their bones that their issues are in their head. But here's the thing, your head is a part of your body, your brain is an organ same as your stomach, lungs, kidneys etc. The thing is, the brain is the epicenter of the body, so it's no surprise that extreme mental distress, stress, and burnout will cause physical symptoms. For example, I will get horrifically physically sick if I'm anxious/stressed out past a certain point. \n\nIn this initial reaction you are indeed the A-hole. \nGoing forward, show some compassion. The worst things you can say are \"It could be so much worse, think about XYZ worse things\" we know. \"It's all in your head\" we know. \"Just snap out of it. What do you have to be so stressed about\" we can't. You can GENTLY suggest therapy and/or medication. But it is NOT your place to dismiss and belittle their symptoms because you don't get it, haven't experienced it, or just don't want to educate yourself about what she's dealing with.\n\nLast thing I'll say in this novella, your child sounds like a gifted kid and they are trying to plow through higher and post graduate education.

One of my girlfriends called my mom who was out grocery shopping at the time; she told my mom that I was breaking down and they couldn\u2019t figure out how to calm me down.

It takes a nuanced approach to help someone accept their severe anxiety is causing them to be in a cycle of physical symptoms that cause more anxiety that lead to a worsening of symptoms, etc. The toll chronic physical illness has on her is just as real as the mental toll, and you need to validate that, not dismiss it.

She could be neurodivergent. She should look into autism/HSP. It often presents differently in girls, and it harder to pick up on and frequently gets misdiagnosed.

Her exhaustion could be autistic burnout, where you have no energy to do anything and life is just in the too hard basket.  Does she have meltdowns and cry? That's common too. \n Learning about polyvagal theory and ways to help shift her nervous system into feeling safe could be really helpful for her regardless.  For whatever reason, (even if she is neurotypical) her nervous system does not feel safe and the tummy troubles are the physical manifestation of that.  \nIf it is related to neurodivergence then managing the trauma of day to day life and sensory overwhelm will really really  help.\nR/aspergirls  is a great support resource and to just lurk and see if she can relate to any of the stuff the other girls and women are going through.", "YTA. your daughter is never going to tell you anything ever again.", "I\u2019m just gonna put in that I can make myself so anxious and stressed out that I get abdominal pain vomiting and can\u2019t stomach to eat for days.

I can see you (OP) likely responded to your daughter with good intentions, so my response is long but I hope useful for context. \n\nSome thoughts: Western medicine is a culture that sharply divides \u201cmental\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d illness in ways that are\u2026laughable. We can all imagine a lawyer who has a heart attack at 54 from stress. There is even a heart failure subtype called \u201cbroken heart syndrome\u201d or \u201cwidows heart\u201d, where emotional shock can cause heart failure severe enough to require the ICU. The treatment for these life-threatening conditions is not just \u201cstop worrying\u201d or \u201cstop grieving\u201d. Again, I know you said that because you want to see your daughter thrive, but I think it misses how profoundly her body may also need help.\n\nOur medical culture also routinely downplays young womens\u2019 concerns and pain, partly from just-beneath-the-surface everyday misogyny (\u201cyou\u2019re just anxious, stop bothering me\u201d) and partly from centuries long misogyny that\u2019s much harder to see (eg drug studies that exclude women, not teaching doctors womens\u2019 heart attack symptoms because we have taken mens\u2019 experiences as \u201cgold standard\u201d). It\u2019s not a perfect analogy, but I recommend reading \u201cBrain on Fire\u201d for some more insight into what happens for a young woman with a disease that she- and her doctors- don\u2019t fully understand, with both mental and physical symptoms.\n\nYour daughter is likely hyper aware of the stigma of having any mental health diagnosis, as well as how disempowering it can be to be\u2026her\u2026in that doctors office. After that, to hear from you that it is \u201call in her head\u201d likely does come off as dismissive. It is the phrase we (doctors, society) often use to dismiss and silence women when the medical establishment doesn\u2019t have a better answer and, instead, \u201cblames\u201d the patient.\n\nEspecially in pain, I would be the first to advocate psychological support/skills/psych meds for people suffering. I would also never phrase it as \u201cin your head\u201d. Instead, if you\u2019re looking for an example to speak about with your daughter, try the ones about the heart attack above. We can all culturally grasp the idea of someone who \u201cworked themselves into the hospital\u201d. Stopping a second heart attack, or abdominal attack, or pain attack, requires addressing the root causes, INCLUDING the mental part of the equation (eg the stressed to death part, or the so sad I could die part). In addition, anyone who has chronic pain (like your daughter) has physiologic changes to opioid receptors that also control mood- so the connection goes the other way as well. For patients, I say something like \u201cwe have studies that show pain alters the way your brain sends signals for both pain AND mood. Fixing pain signals requires addressing your mood signals as well, because they\u2019re part of the same system). \n\nMore than anything, your daughter needs your support and, if she wants it, your help advocating to be heard in the medical system. She needs to be heard and believed, and she needs agency to direct her medical care. If in doubt, I\u2019d recommend just communicating that you trust her (meaning you believe what she tells you about her symptoms and you trust her decisions) and that you\u2019ll support her.

Therapy for like anxiety if she's not in therapy - maybe look into CBT or MBCBT. Also might look into somatic therapy, where the point is to really involve how thought & emotions feel in the body (fluttering, heart palpitations, tightness or pressure in the jaw, neck, chest, etc, heat, pain, lightheadedness ) & working to calm down the body's reaction through the body, which then has a slowing effect on racing thoughts, etc. I know that some somatic therapists work with therapy dogs as well, who are specially trained to use their slow/calm/regular nervous system to slow & calm the nervous system of the patient....

I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being purposefully cruel, but the impact on your daughter was the same, regardless.\n\nSecond: I\u2019d like to share my own experience with similar circumstances. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll see this, OP, and I don\u2019t mean to project onto your daughter, but I hope I can give a bit of perspective from someone in a like position. I\u2019m a woman in my 20s, stereotypical \u201chigh achiever.\u201d I\u2019ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety with some obsessive compulsive tendencies, and I also started experiencing abdominal pain while I was in college. I was told that young women presenting with abdominal pain are some of the most difficult people to diagnose in day to day medicine. It can be anything, really (reproductive system, bowels, bladder, psychosomatic, and so on). I never got answers despite substantial testing and I still experience some pain. What I am grateful for is that no one involved in my medical care invalidated my pain. Even if the pain was a manifestation of my stress and anxiety, it was very much real and very much not my fault. And even if it was \u201cmy fault\u201d for worrying, what was someone telling me to chill out gonna do? Upset me more, probably.\n\nI say that because my parents definitely have done the \u201dget out of your own head\u201d method of trying to help my mental health. They\u2019re well-intentioned, but it\u2019s more harmful than helpful. What has been helpful for me personally has been meds (obviously not for everyone), and therapy to help me develop coping mechanisms. You\u2019ve mentioned in comments Eden was in therapy for depression previously and it didn\u2019t help. Consider encouraging her to try again now that\u2019s she\u2019s older and circumstances have changed. She may be able to learn more, or a different provider may be a better fit.\n\nLastly: I think you replied to a comment that suggested her worrying was picked up in childhood with something like \u2018if this was the case her brothers would be the same.\u2019 (Sorry if I\u2019ve misread). While this may be true and it\u2019s owing all to brain chemistry, there\u2019s always a possibility that your kids just didn\u2019t have the same lives despite your efforts to raise them the same. Perhaps she experienced some trauma she hasn\u2019t disclosed to you that is part of this. Or, she\u2019s a woman, and she\u2019s an eldest child, and these can sometimes cause parents to (even unconsciously) put different expectations or biases on a kid. She may even perceive certain expectations or favoritism toward boys/younger kids you may not intend. For me, I know I always perceived an expectation of super high achievement because I lived in a competitive household with smart/athletic/popular siblings. But my parents never actively put those demands upon me. You may be missing context that\u2019s important to her experience, and your comments will have felt dismissive of that.\n\nWishing Eden health and peace, and hope you will have the opportunity to sincerely apologize face to face. I encourage you to leave advice to the professionals and listen where you can, if and when she wants to talk.", "I have this same problem.

They finally took me back and the doctor walked in, and dismissed me right away saying it was shift change and I wasnt in need of immediate care, so the incoming doctor would see me. 2 hours later, the incoming doc comes in rolls his eyes and tells me it was heartburn. I lost my temper and told him it wasn't f** heartburn and he needed to do his job. He got an attitude and told me he could waste time and money running tests if I'd prefer. I told him to do it. They get me in for an ultrasound and an xray (yes. In my first trimester, he ordered an xray). A blood tech comes in and looks really confused. She asks if I know what they're testing me for. I tell her the doc doesn't know and she says it's the most random selection of tests she's ever seen. As if the doc just randomly checked boxes. I was exhausted by this point and didn't care. 7am, I'm peeing orange, my eyes are yellow, and I haven't seen the doctor since the first discussion. I tell my boyfriend to call my parents and let them know. My dad comes in, takes one look at me and storms the hall stopping every nurse and doctor that comes nearby demanding someone to see me. Finally at 830am, a team of doctors swoops into my room. The lady in charge says they're taking me for my surgery. I ask what is going on, and she asks if the doctor told me anything. I let them know it's clearly heartburn and I haven't seen any doctor since 3am. She looks really grim, and says if they don't get me into surgery in the next hour, I will die.

Then ask yourself if you sound like an AH? I\u2019ll give you an example. \u2018If you don\u2019t want to feel bad anymore, why don\u2019t you just stop having asthma attacks\u2019. See? You sound like an AH.", "This is what happened to my mom, she'd been having debilitating stomach aches and blood in her stool for months and her doc kept sending her away with \"it's just stress, try to relax more\". 11 months later she died from bowel cancer at age 53.", "\"Hey, you seem stressed. Are you ok?\" Then you just listen. Don't go into problem solving mode. \"I'm sorry you're going through that. That sounds really hard.\" Then ask if there's anything you can do to help, and accept it if they say no. \n\nThen you leave it at that because other people's personal problems are not your responsibility. If it's becoming an issue in the workplace, bring it up with your boss.", "True. It does cause physical symptoms. Mom's advice would not be helpful for that. I had \"anxiety attacks\" for a bit before a doctor said it was just acid reflux, which I knew it was not. Follow ups with a different doctor who ordered scans found my gallbladder was dying and causing some of my symptoms. Coworkers were dismissive, thought I was faking it, and the initial doctor too. It sucks when that happens and OP did exactly that to her daughter, dismissed her very real concerns. Real enough to go to the doctor repeatedly. Anyhow, she should defintely look into anxiety relief techniques, honestly everyone should, because they can be helpful even if that may not be the major issue", "Q:  What do you call the person who graduated last in their class from medical school?\n\nA: \"Doctor.\"\n\nYeah, don't accept BS diagnoses from bad doctors.  My sister is a doctor and has spent half her career at small clinics in the suburbs and half her career at a world-famous hospital.   Just the other day she said one of the huge differences is that at the clinics she can't trust that patients have been cared for correctly.  Like, you know, getting a head scan for severe and persistent head/neck pain.  People, if you've got something seriously wrong and your local docs can't figure it out, *go somewhere else*.  I hope you're doing OK, and glad you finally got a non-idiot for a doctor.  I also hope OP pulls her head out of her ass and actually helps her daughter.

Life is perfect. Every issue solved. Silly me choosing to have ptsd and adhd. NOW I JUST CHOOSE TO BE \"NORMAL\"!!!!\n\n(/s of it wasn't clear... I hate people)", "High jacking the top comment to add:\nI was told for 4 years that my symptoms were \u201cin my head\u201d.\nAnd I suppose the doctors were right. Turns out my brain is swollen and I\u2019ve had 2 brain surgeries so far with no improvement and more to come!\n\nDon\u2019t dismiss your daughter so easily! & YTA.", "I always tell people telling a depressed person to \"just cheer up\" is akin to telling a person with a broken leg to \"just walk\". Doesn't work that way.", "Oh I have a good one. Last year I had my 6th major knee surgery (29 at the time). I was having fevers, something wasn\u2019t right this time. My surgeon blew me off saying I was having stress fevers and was psychosomatic. I had MRSA. Ended up having two more surgeries, a wound vac, went super septic and now I have chronic leukopenia.

Was told my depression caused all that.\n\nTurns out i've had Lyme disease for years...", "There's also something called nociplastic pain. There's no identifiable tissue damage but the patient is definitely in pain. It's not psychosomatic and it's the kind present is a few different chronic pain disorders (eg elhers danlos is diagnosed based on other things and fibromyalgia is a diagnosis of exclusion messing you rule out everything else first, and there are others).\n\nI used to vomit and have awful stomach pain a LOT. Getting help for ptsd and adhd helped me a ton. This girl sounds like she has anxiety disorder at least. Is anyone checking her mental health? Meds and/or therapy might be really helpful for her.", "Also if it is anxiety leading to stomach ache that's not psychosomatic. That's a physiological pain caused by psychological triggers.", "It's exactly what psychosomatic means. Pain she feels is physical ( somatic),caused by psychological triggers.", "Yes, I think the term has changed here, but this was at least 10 years ago.
