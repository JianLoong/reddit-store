Well you're not very helpful, are you ?", "YTA, but I get where you're coming from.\n\nMy mom was the same way.I've dealt with anxiety and panic attacks for the majority of my life. I was always nervous. In my 20's, it hit extra hard. I went from just being internal anxious to presenting physical symptoms from the repeated trauma I was putting myself through being on-edge at all times.The entire time that was happening, my mom kept telling me to just \"get out of my head\", \"take up a hobby\", \"get more sleep\", \"just stop overthinking\", etc. This went on for long enough that I stopped telling her when things were wrong with me. I stopped trusting that she'd support me when I needed it the most. She was right, to a degree, that I did need to get out of my head. I needed to learn coping skills and ways to work with and understand where the anxiety was coming from. The last thing I need to be told was that I should just stop panicking.\n\nAbout a decade after I stopped going to her for support, right in the middle of covid, my mom has a heart attack. She has now spent the last two years an absolute nervous wreck. I've helped talked her down during panic attacks, chatted with her late into the night to make sure she is okay, helped work with her on developing coping skills while encouraging her to seek out someone to talk to so that she can start to unpack the trauma of almost dying. Never once in these 2 years have I told her that she just needs to get out of her head and stop overthinking. It took a little while, but she finally said that if she had known that this was anywhere close to how I felt all those years ago, she would have never once said the things that she said.\n\nIt can be really hard to understand where another person is coming from when you aren't someone that has the anxiety brain. If she could just step away from it all, I promise your daughter would. For now, as her mom, the best thing you can do is help her take her mind off things. Be her support. Don't just tell her to get out of her head, see if she wants to spend time together. See if she wants to see a movie, take a walk, something. If she wants to talk about it, just let her talk. Don't offer advice. Just listen. She needs your emotional support.", "This is giving me these kind of vibes \u201cOh are you depressed?

You were indeed dismissive, and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you've probably not had to deal with long term mental illness. Your post and the response to your daughter REEKS of ignorance and an unwillingness to try to learn and understand. \n\nPeople with mental health issues KNOW often deeply in their bones that their issues are in their head. But here's the thing, your head is a part of your body, your brain is an organ same as your stomach, lungs, kidneys etc. The thing is, the brain is the epicenter of the body, so it's no surprise that extreme mental distress, stress, and burnout will cause physical symptoms. For example, I will get horrifically physically sick if I'm anxious/stressed out past a certain point. \n\nIn this initial reaction you are indeed the A-hole. \nGoing forward, show some compassion. The worst things you can say are \"It could be so much worse, think about XYZ worse things\" we know. \"It's all in your head\" we know. \"Just snap out of it. What do you have to be so stressed about\" we can't. You can GENTLY suggest therapy and/or medication. But it is NOT your place to dismiss and belittle their symptoms because you don't get it, haven't experienced it, or just don't want to educate yourself about what she's dealing with.\n\nLast thing I'll say in this novella, your child sounds like a gifted kid and they are trying to plow through higher and post graduate education.

One of my girlfriends called my mom who was out grocery shopping at the time; she told my mom that I was breaking down and they couldn\u2019t figure out how to calm me down.

It takes a nuanced approach to help someone accept their severe anxiety is causing them to be in a cycle of physical symptoms that cause more anxiety that lead to a worsening of symptoms, etc. The toll chronic physical illness has on her is just as real as the mental toll, and you need to validate that, not dismiss it.

She could be neurodivergent. She should look into autism/HSP. It often presents differently in girls, and it harder to pick up on and frequently gets misdiagnosed.

Her exhaustion could be autistic burnout, where you have no energy to do anything and life is just in the too hard basket.  Does she have meltdowns and cry? That's common too. \n Learning about polyvagal theory and ways to help shift her nervous system into feeling safe could be really helpful for her regardless.  For whatever reason, (even if she is neurotypical) her nervous system does not feel safe and the tummy troubles are the physical manifestation of that.  \nIf it is related to neurodivergence then managing the trauma of day to day life and sensory overwhelm will really really  help.\nR/aspergirls  is a great support resource and to just lurk and see if she can relate to any of the stuff the other girls and women are going through.", "YTA. your daughter is never going to tell you anything ever again.", "I\u2019m just gonna put in that I can make myself so anxious and stressed out that I get abdominal pain vomiting and can\u2019t stomach to eat for days.

I can see you (OP) likely responded to your daughter with good intentions, so my response is long but I hope useful for context. \n\nSome thoughts: Western medicine is a culture that sharply divides \u201cmental\u201d and \u201cphysical\u201d illness in ways that are\u2026laughable. We can all imagine a lawyer who has a heart attack at 54 from stress. There is even a heart failure subtype called \u201cbroken heart syndrome\u201d or \u201cwidows heart\u201d, where emotional shock can cause heart failure severe enough to require the ICU. The treatment for these life-threatening conditions is not just \u201cstop worrying\u201d or \u201cstop grieving\u201d. Again, I know you said that because you want to see your daughter thrive, but I think it misses how profoundly her body may also need help.\n\nOur medical culture also routinely downplays young womens\u2019 concerns and pain, partly from just-beneath-the-surface everyday misogyny (\u201cyou\u2019re just anxious, stop bothering me\u201d) and partly from centuries long misogyny that\u2019s much harder to see (eg drug studies that exclude women, not teaching doctors womens\u2019 heart attack symptoms because we have taken mens\u2019 experiences as \u201cgold standard\u201d). It\u2019s not a perfect analogy, but I recommend reading \u201cBrain on Fire\u201d for some more insight into what happens for a young woman with a disease that she- and her doctors- don\u2019t fully understand, with both mental and physical symptoms.\n\nYour daughter is likely hyper aware of the stigma of having any mental health diagnosis, as well as how disempowering it can be to be\u2026her\u2026in that doctors office. After that, to hear from you that it is \u201call in her head\u201d likely does come off as dismissive. It is the phrase we (doctors, society) often use to dismiss and silence women when the medical establishment doesn\u2019t have a better answer and, instead, \u201cblames\u201d the patient.\n\nEspecially in pain, I would be the first to advocate psychological support/skills/psych meds for people suffering. I would also never phrase it as \u201cin your head\u201d. Instead, if you\u2019re looking for an example to speak about with your daughter, try the ones about the heart attack above. We can all culturally grasp the idea of someone who \u201cworked themselves into the hospital\u201d. Stopping a second heart attack, or abdominal attack, or pain attack, requires addressing the root causes, INCLUDING the mental part of the equation (eg the stressed to death part, or the so sad I could die part). In addition, anyone who has chronic pain (like your daughter) has physiologic changes to opioid receptors that also control mood- so the connection goes the other way as well. For patients, I say something like \u201cwe have studies that show pain alters the way your brain sends signals for both pain AND mood. Fixing pain signals requires addressing your mood signals as well, because they\u2019re part of the same system). \n\nMore than anything, your daughter needs your support and, if she wants it, your help advocating to be heard in the medical system. She needs to be heard and believed, and she needs agency to direct her medical care. If in doubt, I\u2019d recommend just communicating that you trust her (meaning you believe what she tells you about her symptoms and you trust her decisions) and that you\u2019ll support her.

They summarise one useful one as follows:\n\n\"a recent multicenter study of over 14,000 ASD individuals reports a higher prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (0.83% versus 0.54%) and other bowel disorders (11.74% versus 4.5%) in ASD patients compared to hospitalized controls\"\n\nAnd conclude:\n\n\"Despite the many studies on GI dysfunction in ASD, whether GI issues are more common in the autism population versus controls is unclear.\"\n\nhttps://journals.lww.com/hrpjournal/fulltext/2014/03000/gastrointestinal_issues_in_autism_spectrum.5.aspx\n\nThere was a study where gut bacteria of autistic children was injected into mice and behavioural differences apparently observed but that study has been heavily criticised due to large flaws in how behavioural differences are assessed as well as the use of mice to research autism in the first place.\n\nScience takes a long time for reliable consensus's to be drawn, no such consensus or reliable conclusion can be drawn from any of what's available on the issue. The only inference one can really make is \"hey, this might be worth further research\".", "Well the  way you are going about things is very definitely not helping, so maybe try shutting up unless you can be supportive? Perhaps if you had tried doing any ring other than ignoring her issues because out didn\u2019t want to deal with them, she\u2019d be in a better place now. It\u2019s not her fault she had an AH for a mother. You blamed her then, you blame her now, and you take no responsibility for your own behaviour.", "The thing you fail to understand is that emotions are not feelings, they are chemicals. Chemicals that greatly affect how the brain processes information and how it perceives reality.\n\nYour daughter isn't \"being negative\" she lives in a different version of reality where all of the irrational fears and negative outcomes are not only possible but probable.\n\nAnd no amount of telling her that they won't  is going to fix that, because to her, you just aren't seeing the world right.", "Telling her to be positive isn\u2019t going to do shit if you dismiss everything she tells you. Somatic symptom disorder is a real thing. We can trap trauma and stress in our bodies. These things literally create diseases. But you want to tell her it\u2019s in her head. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re one of those types who thinks you can cure cancer if you really believe", "How do you think this sounds to her? All you are doing with this \"advice\" is making her more anxious. Frankly, don't be shocked if she realizes you are the source of her stress and cuts contact.", "https://youtu.be/-4EDhdAHrOg\n\nThis, OP, and stop what you're doing and just LISTEN", "I\u2019m so glad my mom actually supports me and isn\u2019t like this. It\u2019s making me want to call my mom and tell her I love her.", "I am amazed she still talks to you at all. Her life would be so much more positive if she cut you out of it.", "Another former-gifted burnout here. Things that have helped me recover:         \n- psych meds        \n- therapy         \n- seriously, meds            \n- taking a full year during quarantine to do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and build my functionality up slowly from zero        \n\n>so I tell her as gently as I can that she needs to try to have a more positive mindset\n\nThings that helped me exactly 0% of the time:         \n- toxic positivity from my mom, who also does this\n- reinforcing academics as a measure of self worth, which my mom did almost by accident with the same mindset as the way you introduce your daughter\n\nIs your daughter on meds for her anxiety/depression? If not, that needs to be top priority. Maybe also tell her that stepping back from school is an option, and you'd still love her and be just as proud of her. (Maybe that's always been true, but how often do you SAY it?) I would encourage you to just listen when she vents instead of invalidating her worries, and leave the \"positive mindset\" redirecting to a therapist. It takes training to do that productively, and you're not a professional, you're her mom. You can be supportive and validating as her mom."]}
