Mary is my cousin and Lydia and Kitty are friends. They wanted to go earlier but I had exams during that time, so we pushed it back a bit. \n\nThis was meant to be a girls trip, but a couple of weeks ago Mary and Kitty both said they wanted to bring their boyfriends and it would be more fun sightseeing with a bigger group. I was a little annoyed because I thought it was just us girls, but Lydia was fine with it and I said sure, whatever. The original hotel situation was 2 rooms - me and Mary in one and Lydia and Kitty in another - but they said they're looking for separate rooms since they'll be staying with their boyfriends, and I'd probably have to bunk with Lydia. I had no issue with that so I didn't ask anymore questions.\n\nSo we arrive at our hotel in Vegas and it turns out Mary and Kitty didn't end up booking rooms. The plan was to arrive at the hotel then see if they can spare a room, but obviously given the holiday season (and it's Vegas) all the affordable rooms were gone. I was pissed because they never said beforehand they hadn't booked. Kitty then said it's not a big issue, we still have the 2 rooms originally booked and if we pay a little extra the hotel gives daybeds. Each couple takes a room, then me and Lydia bunk with one.\n\nI never agreed to this and I didn't feel comfortable third wheeling with Mary and her boyfriend, who I don't know very well to begin with. I suggested checking a nearby hotel to see if they had a room, but the others didn't want to be separated. I then said maybe we can put the boys in one room and the 4 of us can squeeze into one, but they shut that down too and insisted the couple plan was best.\n\nEventually I told them I'm not comfortable with this and I'm out, hope they have fun. Mary said it's really not a big deal and Lydia has no problem with it, she came by herself too so what's my issue. I ended up finding a place to check into for the night, and caught a flight back yesterday.\n\nWell all 3 of them are really pissed at me, saying they changed the timing for me and I've ruined the vacation, and if I really didn't want to go I should've opted out before. Kitty texted saying she didn't realize I was so prudish and \"gag at the sight of a man\" (doesn't make much sense because I'm married), and \"thanks for making this all about you\".\n\nSo reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1671106625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmjp6p/aita_for_leaving_a_vegas_trip_after_we_got_there/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't agree to share a room with a couple because that couldn't be bothered to book one.", "NTA.  The ones with the boyfriends were the ones that changed the original configuration of the rooms so they should have been the ones to deal with the rooming issue.  The two couples could have stayed in the same room,  you and Lydia could have had the other room.", "NTA. The conditions changed when you got there and you realized your friends had not done what they had promised they would do.

They should have left your and Lydia's room alone and shared the other room if they were too lazy to book a third.\n\nThe idea that you ruined a vacation by opting out of a situation you're not comfortable with is immature and frankly awful. You would have ruined it by pouting or complaining the whole time, but you are not required to be there for them to have fun. \n\nTheir guilt at putting you in an uncomfortable situation ruined their vacation. They're just mad at you for not absolving them of it by pretending everything was fine.", "NTA - besides the fact that you are married.

They changed the trip after it was arranged and then left some things to the last minute. They ruined it for you. You agreed to a girls trip. They stopped that from happening.", "NTA. You need better friends.", "NTA. Mary and Kitty were absolutely wrong in this situation. If anything, the two couples should have take the second room while Lydia and you shared a room as planned. Them inviting their boyfriends, then not finding additional rooms, and then trying to force you into a room arrangement that made you uncomfortable was all ridiculous. They failed every step of the way and ruined the trip. That wasn\u2019t what you signed up for.", "Nta\n\nThose 2 just wanted their boyfriends along for free.  Treating you and Lydia like mugs. Lydis angry because she's realised what a mug she's been.  That's on her.  Anyhow, after you said 'see ya, don't wanna be here', the 3 girls could have had one room and the boyfriends the other.

That was a huge change and not OK. Good for you for not just sucking it up.

They made the trip more complicated by wanting to bring their boyfriends, which is super rude in my opinion, and then didn't properly accommodate for those extra people, making you uncomfortable in the process.

That\u2019s complete BS, and I would have left, too. \n\nIt was bad enough to switch up a girls\u2019 weekend to a couple thing. I think you have more leeway than you should have. \n\nThey ruined the vacation, not you.", "NTA. They agreed to change the timing for you, & the original bookings were made to reflect that - I'm absolutely positive you all didn't pay for days you weren't even there! The agreement to adding boyfriends was that the people with boyfriends book their own rooms for that, specifically because the boyfriends were being added. They didn't book rooms to cover the extra people, leaving it so at the very last minute you were paying for the accommodation of a room but being stuck with a daybed in a room with a couple. That's absolutely absurd. If anyone 'ruined' the trip, it was the attached people who could neither leave their boyfriends behind nor book extra accommodations for them.", "NTA\n\nYour friends' lack of planning is not something you are obligated to cater to.", "Nta. You agreed to the original plan. And then the plan got changed after rooms were booked and no one bothered to find extra accommodations for the extra people. Then you tried to still be cool about it.

You're not a prude to not want to share a room with a couple. It IS an uncomfortable feeling. I know I hardly slept at all when I stayed in the same room as my friend and her husband. And I'm certainly not a prude. And they dropped the ball not you. If they keep it up you may need to find better friends.", "NTA They made changes to the plan, then didn't follow through on it. The ones that ruined the trip were the ones that didn't follow through on booking the extra rooms before hand.", "NTA. And never go on trips with them again. They changed the plans and knew this would happen. They just expected you to roll over.", "NTA. They don\u2019t make a lot of sense. First it was a girls trip, and then it wasn\u2019t by bringing boyfriends. If boyfriends were there, what difference would it now make if you weren\u2019t there? \n\nThey changed the plans without telling you and expected you to just go along with it. They sound exhausting and not people you would really want to waste your vacation time and money on again.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t agree to go on a trip and bunk with males you hardly know, you have no obligation to stay somewhere you don\u2019t feel comfortable and it doesn\u2019t make you prudish. I don\u2019t know many guys who would want to stay on a daybed with a couple either, what a dumb accusation.

I wouldn't be comfortable with that situation either.", "NTA.\nTheir boyfriends should have payed for an extra room for you and the other girl that was uncoupled, because they were inserted into the plan later. Nothing turned out to be a trip that you agreed to in the first place and their 'on the go' solutions were very disrespectful. I can't imagine someone wanting me to sleep on emergency bed like a hobo during what was supposed to be my vacation. Or to share a room with a couple.

Or stuck to the original girls trip plan.", "I'm actually pissy because I've never been to Vegas and was looking forward to it, but the hotel situation was a nope. I do feel kind of bad for up and leaving because I guess I could've sucked it up, but I felt weird staying with a couple. My husband said he'll take me to Vegas next year thought and we can \"stay at the Luxor, not a dinky daybed\" haha", "oh I think that was their plan all along to save money!", "Especially since you have a husband that you could have brought.", "Honestly I would have stayed, but been disappointed. Not worth leaving. You are so young though, there will be other trips. I am 36, you are still early twenties."]}
