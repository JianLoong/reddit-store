Mary is my cousin and Lydia and Kitty are friends. They wanted to go earlier but I had exams during that time, so we pushed it back a bit. \n\nThis was meant to be a girls trip, but a couple of weeks ago Mary and Kitty both said they wanted to bring their boyfriends and it would be more fun sightseeing with a bigger group. I was a little annoyed because I thought it was just us girls, but Lydia was fine with it and I said sure, whatever. The original hotel situation was 2 rooms - me and Mary in one and Lydia and Kitty in another - but they said they're looking for separate rooms since they'll be staying with their boyfriends, and I'd probably have to bunk with Lydia. I had no issue with that so I didn't ask anymore questions.\n\nSo we arrive at our hotel in Vegas and it turns out Mary and Kitty didn't end up booking rooms. The plan was to arrive at the hotel then see if they can spare a room, but obviously given the holiday season (and it's Vegas) all the affordable rooms were gone. I was pissed because they never said beforehand they hadn't booked. Kitty then said it's not a big issue, we still have the 2 rooms originally booked and if we pay a little extra the hotel gives daybeds. Each couple takes a room, then me and Lydia bunk with one.\n\nI never agreed to this and I didn't feel comfortable third wheeling with Mary and her boyfriend, who I don't know very well to begin with. I suggested checking a nearby hotel to see if they had a room, but the others didn't want to be separated. I then said maybe we can put the boys in one room and the 4 of us can squeeze into one, but they shut that down too and insisted the couple plan was best.\n\nEventually I told them I'm not comfortable with this and I'm out, hope they have fun. Mary said it's really not a big deal and Lydia has no problem with it, she came by herself too so what's my issue. I ended up finding a place to check into for the night, and caught a flight back yesterday.\n\nWell all 3 of them are really pissed at me, saying they changed the timing for me and I've ruined the vacation, and if I really didn't want to go I should've opted out before. Kitty texted saying she didn't realize I was so prudish and \"gag at the sight of a man\" (doesn't make much sense because I'm married), and \"thanks for making this all about you\".\n\nSo reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1671106625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmjp6p/aita_for_leaving_a_vegas_trip_after_we_got_there/", "score": 270, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
