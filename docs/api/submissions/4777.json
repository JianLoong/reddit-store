Mary is my cousin and Lydia and Kitty are friends. They wanted to go earlier but I had exams during that time, so we pushed it back a bit. \n\nThis was meant to be a girls trip, but a couple of weeks ago Mary and Kitty both said they wanted to bring their boyfriends and it would be more fun sightseeing with a bigger group. I was a little annoyed because I thought it was just us girls, but Lydia was fine with it and I said sure, whatever. The original hotel situation was 2 rooms - me and Mary in one and Lydia and Kitty in another - but they said they're looking for separate rooms since they'll be staying with their boyfriends, and I'd probably have to bunk with Lydia. I had no issue with that so I didn't ask anymore questions.\n\nSo we arrive at our hotel in Vegas and it turns out Mary and Kitty didn't end up booking rooms. The plan was to arrive at the hotel then see if they can spare a room, but obviously given the holiday season (and it's Vegas) all the affordable rooms were gone. I was pissed because they never said beforehand they hadn't booked. Kitty then said it's not a big issue, we still have the 2 rooms originally booked and if we pay a little extra the hotel gives daybeds. Each couple takes a room, then me and Lydia bunk with one.\n\nI never agreed to this and I didn't feel comfortable third wheeling with Mary and her boyfriend, who I don't know very well to begin with. I suggested checking a nearby hotel to see if they had a room, but the others didn't want to be separated. I then said maybe we can put the boys in one room and the 4 of us can squeeze into one, but they shut that down too and insisted the couple plan was best.\n\nEventually I told them I'm not comfortable with this and I'm out, hope they have fun. Mary said it's really not a big deal and Lydia has no problem with it, she came by herself too so what's my issue. I ended up finding a place to check into for the night, and caught a flight back yesterday.\n\nWell all 3 of them are really pissed at me, saying they changed the timing for me and I've ruined the vacation, and if I really didn't want to go I should've opted out before. Kitty texted saying she didn't realize I was so prudish and \"gag at the sight of a man\" (doesn't make much sense because I'm married), and \"thanks for making this all about you\".\n\nSo reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1671106625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmjp6p/aita_for_leaving_a_vegas_trip_after_we_got_there/", "score": 765, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have been the third wheel in a hotel room before but ours had 2 beds, the couple disappeared during the day when we return to the room later my BED was rumpled. when i asked them WTF why my bed their reply was \"sorry it was the closest to door; we thought the cleaning crew was gonna clean it once we left, sorry\" When, if they had already clean the rooms and they put a \"do not Disturb\" sign up ,smh. i made them request clean sheets and make my bed and lesson learn, I only do solo rooms from then on.", "NTA. \n\nYou planned and paid for a room, and agreed to share that room with ONE other person, a woman, and a woman you know. \n\nI would be out too, and I'm certainly not a prude when I think back to the things that went on in vegas hotel rooms when we went there as big groups. But who wants to sleep on a rollout bed with a couple?\n\nThe solution should have been - the two couples share a room and you and Lydia get a room- and they just suck it up and deal since they didn't book an additional room for the guests they wanted to bring.", "NTA.   It would be extremely uncomfortable sharing a room with a couple, especially if you hardly know the boyfriend.  They neglected to make reservations and have no right to accuse you of ruining their trip.  THEY reuined the trip by changing the parameters and not making reservations.", "NTA.  Your friends giving you grief about this are total hypocrites.  Pushing back the timeline of the trip due to exams is one thing, them steamrolling the group because two of them brought their BFs is entirely different.  Who wants to share a hotel room with someone they don't know, and with a couple, to boot?  If you were good friends with them both, maybe, but that was never the plan.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "If they were both double rooms why didn't both couples stay together and the other two girls room together? NTA\n\nThe couples sound ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nMary and Kitty are NOT friends.  Time to expand your social circle.", "NTA.  They changed the plan and lied about it.  You weren't obligated to make them comfortable and save them money at your own expense.", "NTA - They changed plans and didn't tell you. Not your job to make people comfortable when you aren't and they didn't make their own plans. Sounds like they were trying to do a cheap trip with their boyfriends.", "NTA - these people and their BF totally treated you badly.  They didn't book rooms and expected to have accommodations anyway?!  They are strangely unable to vacation without bf and THAT ruined the break.\n\nSurely the people who booked and planned in advance should have the bed and the late additions sleep on the floor or find another hotel", "NTA we're planning a guys trip to Vegas right now, if o e henpecked guy decides to bring his woman, I'm out!! Your Boyfriends don't have money to get rooms? ( the not wanting to be split up is B S.)", "NTA. If it was no big deal they could very well have told you sooner. The truth is they knew you wouldn\u2019t go for it. And I\u2019m sure your husband wouldn\u2019t be a fan of it either. And lastly, those daybeds suck to sleep on.", "NTA. They kept changing it and who wants to sleep with a couple in the same room. You had every right to leave.", "NTA. I would never, ever, ever share a hotel room with someone I do not know, male or female, but especially male. nope nope nope. \n\nalso, I would've backed out the second it was mentioned the boyfriends were coming. this kind of situation never ends well. if a girls trip turns into one of the girls bringing a boyfriend, just back out. it usually ends up being a mess.", "op=NTA\n\nThey changed plans. You offered compromises after they fafo about the lack of rooms.  \n\nHow much was this about \"Saving\" money.  and why do I feel like you were expected to pay the same amount even tho two more people were added to the expense of four peope(ie 1/4th not 1/6th)\n\nI don't think I'd feel that comfortable sharing rooms without some sort of warning and choice first.", "NTA. The girls who fucked it up by bringing bfs are the assholes. Oh yeah and didn\u2019t book an extra room.", "NTA the entitlement from those girls bringing bfs then being like yeah sleep in the same room with one you don\u2019t know. Then being like you gag at the sight of a man if you don\u2019t want to sleep next to one you don\u2019t know. Good for you just leaving that weekend wouldn\u2019t have been fun even if you did all their demands", "NTA.  Find more mature friends.", "NTA. Having the boyfriends along was not what you signed up for. And having to share a room with a couple is DEFINITELY not what you signed up for. Mary and Kitty were the ones who ruined the trip by not booking rooms in advance. \n\n(And I love your choice of fake names! You must be Elizabeth, because Jane would have just gone along with the new plans.)", "NTA. I would have just not shared my room and would have had a fun vacation by myself.", "NTA, why did your husband not come as well? Why bring only 2 boyfriends on a girl trip? I think your friends don't quite get the concept and they are stupid for wanting to 'wait till they get to the hotel, to book extra rooms for the same price. That is just laughable, they obviously don't get out much.... They should have stuck to the plan and pay for the more expensive room.", "NTA sometimes learning that people aren't actually your friends can be expensive sounds like this might fit that category", "NTA. You never have to spend the night in a situation that makes you uncomfortable.", "Yeah that sounds like an awesome trip. How quickly and how often would you get locked out of your room so Mary and her boyfriend can bump uglies?\n\nNTA", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable either. I\u2019m not paying money to sleep on a daybed and in a room with a couple. That\u2019s a hard pass", "NTA they didn't really plan that out well at all, did they?\n\nI would have been just as frustrated and would have left too", "NTA they changed the plan and wonder why you don't want to room with a couple one of which you don't know?  You need better friends.  No way would I stay in the same room with a couple!", "NTA\n\nAre you sure that wasn't the plan all along?  It seems really odd to me that two beds per room wasn't the plan from the start when those are usually easier to book than singles.", "I hate when people dismiss someone's concerns by saying, \"it's not a big deal\".  Once when told this I replied you need to add two words to the end of your sentence to make it complete, \"to me\".  This is because that is exactly what the person is saying, it's not that big a deal to me.", "NTA and these are not your friends. Time for a new friend group. They don\u2019t respect your boundaries and then get mad when you didn\u2019t let them trounce all over them ! \n\nGood riddance. You deserve better.", "NTA so your girls trip where you booked and paid for a real bed in a hotel room turned into a couples trip with you sleeping on a cot like a child?  I'd have left too.  They didn't respect your choices at all for the trip, why stay?", "NTA- it was a girls trip. It's not your fault 2 of your friends couldn't go a few days without some dick.", ">Eventually I told them I'm not comfortable with this and I'm out, hope they have fun. Mary said it's really not a big deal and Lydia has no problem with it, she came by herself too so what's my issue.\n\nYour issue is that Lydia and Kitty are Mary's friends. Not yours. So Mary might actually know the boyfriends, whereas you probably do not. I also would not want to sleep on a cot with a strange man and a girl I know just a bit having sex in the big bed... \n\nNTA at all. And I love it that your husband will take you another time!!", "NTA\n\nMainly because if I were to go on a vacation and dishing out the money for a hotel room, I would expect to sleep on an actual bed not a cot. And sharing a room, I would need to be in agreement on sharing that room before leaving knowing with whom instead of musical rooms that anyone else seems to be playing at. \n\nAnd if I sign up for a girls' trip, it is supposed to be a girls trip. No boyfriends.", "Your friends suck. Just because they were \"fine with it\" doesn't negate your right to have different feelings. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nThey could have found another room.\n\nThey planned this from the start to save money.\n\nI wonder how the men felt about it.  I can't see any perspective that this sounds reasonable. The only way this arrangement could be feasible is if it was a one night crash pad situation.", "NTA. Can you explain how you not being there \"ruined\" the vacation? Doesn't it save the vacation because now there is more room? Are you the only fun one of the group?", "NTA. You are always allowed to leave situations if they make you uncomfortable.", "NTA", "Umm OP if only you and  Lydia are the only ones who booked rooms, is your credit card attached to either of those rooms you left? I'm concerned you might get stuck with a bunch of charges. Absolutely NTA btw!", "NTA you are not obligated to share a room with ANYONE whether they\u2019re your best friend or someone you barely know\n\nI really hope they didn\u2019t seriously think they could show up and get a room during the holiday season\nThey probably planned it this way to make the room cheaper\n\nHas Lydia and or Kitty done this type of thing before? Insist on bringing their boyfriends to what\u2019s supposed to be a girls\u2019 night out? Either they are super clingy or there\u2019s other issues at hand\n\nMight be worth taking a hard look at your friendships with them and decide of you want to keep being friends with them or not.", "NTA\n\nYou need new friends.", "NTA they should have planned better.\n\nAre you Lizzie or Jane?", "NTA.  They don't get to be rude and then complain about it.  They were being cheap and just didn't want to pay for the extra room.   I would've left to.  They ruined YOUR trip.", "NTA. Your friends don't seem to consider your feelings at all. Sorry - but your friends are AH except maybe Lydia.", "NTA. You don't have to go along them just because everyone else is. There's this cool saying my mom used use about all of my friends and a bridge that really applies to this. I'd have gone home too.", "Nta they didn't make it clear that they didn't book a room a head of time and then try to force you into a situation your not comfortable with? You might want to look into getting new friends.", "NTA whatsoever.", ">Well all 3 of them are really pissed at me, saying they changed the timing for me and I've ruined the vacation, and if I really didn't want to go I should've opted out before.\n\nNTA OP but now you've learned. When \"friends\" unilaterally alter the deal (plans) you should just nope out before they alter it any [further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpE_xMRiCLE)\n\n(OP I would recommend sending them the clip and letting them know you weren't interested in dancing to their tune or wearing clown shoes because you don't think theirs would fit you)", "NTA. Although I would have pulled out when they wanted to bring the two guys. That instantly changed the trip into a couple's trip and two single people coming along.\n\nOP, I would have left too. They're trying to make it your problem, when it's not.\n\nI would text back. \"You guys turned a girls' trip into a couple's trip, then didn't book the room you needed to book, then tried to make it our problem. The nicest thing I could have done was leave. Don't turn around and make this into my problem when you should be apologizing.\"", "Yeah not planning ahead of time drives me crazy and they put the burden on everyone else.", "I went searching for this comment!", "And anyone else think that if OP had stayed and gone along, she\u2019d have been woken up in the middle of the night to\u2026 \u201cnoises\u201d in the other bed?", "This - and of course OP would still have to pay the full price for the room that she was originally paying for - no discount for her at all.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I'd recommend the Linq.  Right in the middle of the Strip.  Easy access to the monorail if you want to use it.  And some decent places to eat inside (Hash House A Go GO) and on High Roller Promenade   \nAs for shows, KA at MGM is favorite of the Cirque shows.  And Zombie Burlesque is hilarious", "NTA. \n\nThey don\u2019t sound like particularly good friends. The two women made it all about them and their boyfriends which was probably the plan all along. They showed a total lack of respect and did not care about you and your feelings.", "I\u2019ve had to share a room with a couple many many times and hated it each time (college trips, I was the only single friend, etc). You totally got shortchanged. Also I love the names. Hope you and Mr. Darcy/Bingley have a great time at the Luxor \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09 almost as good as Pemberly", "Your husband is a prince. As for your friends, yikes. Changing the terms of the trip and then (a) not adjusting the accommodations to the new parameters and (b) not telling you about that is ... cheap.

I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a twin bed anywhere there. I\u2019ve booked economy rooms in hotels there many times and a queen bed is always the norm.

That was obviously the best plan. If you want to fuck get your own room. Seriously though there are so many hotels in Vegas.

Weird, but that's how they do it", "Doubles in the US usually means two full or two queen beds in the room. And only a few hotels that cater to families with small children offer single/twin size beds in any configuration. So a room with a single bed usually has a king, but sometimes a queen."]}
