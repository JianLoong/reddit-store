They\u2019re willful decisions to hurt your partner. She\u2019s right not to tolerate them, and you shouldn\u2019t either. \n\nIn a long term relationship with someone, it is inevitable that they will eventually upset you in some way. Being willing to work through hurt feelings/tough situations is NOT the same as accepting disrespect, abuse, or willful disregard for your well-being.", "LMAO right? I dont think I could be friends with another woman that had this sort of mindset. Sound like a walking door man for men.", "Yeah \u201csending a car\u201d means sending Uber or Lyft or a private car. Not car as a gift or something.", "I sincerely doubt that. But my standards are much higher than yours.", "I wouldn't, and I have full access to his phone, email accounts and everything else. Just like he could go through mine if he wanted. \n\nCommunication, trust and understanding builds relationships. \n\nI don't know who hurt you, but hopefully you'll get help for that and realize not all men are cheating lying assholes", "K. Keep accepting being cheated on then. \n\nHow was she wrong?\n\nETA: I Will say it's no one's fault to be cheated on. Thats the assholes decision. But if you choose to stay after being treated poorly you have shown that person how you will accept being treated going forward", "No.. because no every man is like that. Do I go through his phone? No. Do I know that if I asked he'd say sure and hand it to me? Yep. I wouldn't find anything worse on his phone than I would find on my own. It's about having standards from the beginning and finding someone you can trust and rely on - and that feels the same way for you. Your complaining about your friends rules - but what you're really complaining about is the fact that she's confident enough to demand to be treated right and unafraid to walk away if she isn't. In a lot of relationships people are treated the way they allow the other person to treat them - which is why having standards and holding to them is healthy.", "So how do you expect to not die alone? Your own requirements are no lying or cheating and you\u2019re convinced every man does both.", "Why are you being so snippy with everyone?", "It's lots of stuff. \n\nIf they tell you they will do something, do they follow through? Do they show up when and where they say?   How do they treat their friends, how do they handle work? Are they takers or givers?\n\nWhat about past relationships- are they honest? When my husband and I got together he had just been off with an on and off again girlfriend. He would tell me if they had talked and would show me conversations when I asked. \n\nDoes he ask your input on things and then value that input? When you disagree how does he treat you? If he does fuck up- does he own it? \n\nI'm not saying it's always easy or that you won't ever have someone make a mistake- yourself included. But you will know with how they treat you and everyone around you if its a pattern or a mistake. \n\nMy husband and I will take walks together just to check in- 2/3 times a week. We are busy, we have kids but I dont think successful relationships are a huge secret. You have to pick a person who picks you and then you both decide that you want to be together and keep working on it.\n\nI'm sorry you are getting so much shit on this thread. I get the feeling you have been treated badly and don't know how to change what you don't feel you can control. You're right- you don't make choices for other people but you do get to decide your reactions. If someone makes you feel like crap- you have to love yourself more than the fear of being alone. Being alone and happy is so much better than with someone and miserable. You are worth it, I promise.", "And the stress of listening to her complain with absolutely no adjustment. I wanna say she's young but I know teens don't think this way. \n\nDisney fantasy and struggleships. Sorry to be harsh but man.... lol", "Ooooooooooh. That makes more sense.", "Finding someone who is respectful about it. People are flawed, thats how we were made, striving for perfection isnt reality", "I\u2019m only two years older than her and I could and would never. These are the women that always end up ostracized from the friend group for a reason", "Oh so you\u2019re okay with being respectfully lied to and cheated on?  \n\nSo your bar is just non existent? Have fun with that!", "Yup! The \"my man needs meeeee/my man is my best friend\" type that wonders why her friends don't \n call her to go out any more.\n\nI hope she wises up for her own sake."]}
