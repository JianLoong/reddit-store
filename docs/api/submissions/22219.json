I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t grow up in a two parent household. However, staying in a relationship with someone when you know 1) there\u2019s no love there anymore 2) he doesn\u2019t care for the baby.. is ultimately unfair to your child. You can\u2019t force something that\u2019s not there and certainly cannot convince that man / near deadbeat father to take care of a child he doesn\u2019t want to. It sucks but your child will grow up to resent you for staying in a home with someone who doesn\u2019t love you or her. You deserve better, your child deserves better. At least if you leave him, the child will know on its own will how shitty the father is instead of forcing something that\u2019s not there and will hurt her even more. Love from 1 person is more than enough. It\u2019s better than 2 with 1 not caring at all. Do better for your child. Don\u2019t project your childhood onto your child or force things you know in your heart shouldn\u2019t. Maybe one day you\u2019ll meet someone that will love your child and you unconditionally but for right now, prioritize you and your child\u2019s true needs and health. I grew up in a two parent household with a parent that was emotionally unavailable and it definitely tore me apart more than not having a parent physically not be there. Please reconsider a divorce/separation. You can do it! NTA", "Why are you still with this guy, seriously?", "The relationship with your husband is a whole other can of worms I won\u2019t comment on, but answering just the question: NTA. My name has an usual spelling that almost everyone mispronounces when they first meet me. I love my name, but I wished it was spelled more typically because it\u2019s so annoying to have to correct people or live with a mispronounced name all the time.", "It sounds like your husband didn't really want a child, but for whatever reason, decided to go along with the IVF, maybe believing it would fail. NTA for changing the child's name to make it easier to pronounce. As someone whose name is frequently mispronounced, I commend you. Staying with this man could be a major mistake, though. Your child will be able to tell very quickly that their father doesn't care. Please get counseling to see if this can be turned around, but please don't stay with him for the sake of the child.", "NTA.", ">Your kid growing up with a bad dad isn't better than growing up without one\n\nUh, no. I've personally witnessed the absolute hell children go through when a woman stays with an ass. The \"children\" are both over 50 now. There are lingering effects to this day, including resentment of their mother for staying. A shit father absolutely is NOT better than no father. Besides which divorce doesn't remove the father from the child's life completely unless that is what *he* wants or he is so bad the court severs his parental rights. If the former do you think the child won't pick up on that undercurrent? If the latter, well, I prefer not to be banned, but it ought to be obvious the child would be better off.", "He got her pregnant ON PURPOSE. Dude had to sign a literal contract for IVF", "The goal was to have a husband who loved his child. HE was the one who didn't hold up his end. HE needs to take accountability.", "Dude they did IVF he had to sign a literal contract stating that a child was EXACTLY what he wanted. HE WANTED THE CHILD AND EVEN PAID A FUCKTON OF MONEY TO GET THE CHILD", "Dude signed a literal contract saying he wanted the baby.", "It was IVF. Dude signed a literal contract for that baby", "Uhh he did when he paid a Dr to impregnate her. He is the dysfunctional one.", "AITA is not for shaming over reproductive autonomy.", "He wanted the child until they had one.", "Please, please do not force a terrible relationship just to have a 2 parent home.  That does more harm than good.\n\nI wish you all the best with an obviously stressful time.  Take care of yourself.", "I said exactly that, a bad that isn't better than no dad.", "Most people do not have about an equal number of \"going well\" and \"why\" days.", "In full disclosure, I took the story at face value and see in the comments from OP later that they actually planned this child with IVF. The concept of having IVF (paying thousands of dollars in my country), then requesting an abortion from your wife would simply be unheard of, the actions of a crazy person. Telling OP that he (the husband)  needs to take responsibility isn't really helpful because that is outside of OP's control.", "Adoption is way less traumatic than a literal lifetime of bad parenting", "When I commented she had not yet clarified that it was IVF. And I never said he didn\u2019t have agency. She never mentioned anything in they way of using or failing to use birth control, so I was just going off of what I read.", "As I said in another comment, when I originally commented she had not included the edit stating that the baby was conceived through IVF. You would think that would be an important piece of information to include in the original post.", "Reproductive autonomy goes both ways.", "Her husband bailed during the pregnancy.  A bit late to not become a mother.", "Doesn't say anywhere in the post they were trying to conceive. It says right there that he was against it and wasn't supportive throughout the pregnancy. If she's thrown it in some comment somewhere, she should edit it into her post. If she hasn't thrown it in a comment, you need to say where you're getting the idea that they were trying to conceive from.\n\n\n>that doesn't mean individual people must be ok with the idea of abortion done on their own bodies\n\nThen she can ask for a divorce and ask for the father custody or to relinquish paternal rights if she wants to avoid all hassle. Or she can give the child up for adoption if she still wanted to keep the marriage. \n\n>You're guilting her for the \"choice\" of keeping the baby, that's essentially the opposite of the intent with pro choice movement\n\nShe has the right to make a choice, but she doesn't have the right to be free of judgement for her choice. She can do what she wants, but that doesn't mean people can't say it's dumb to pick the path of most resistance and then complain she's facing resistance. \n\nAnyone could see from miles away that having a child with someone who doesn't want children would lead to problems. Children are a 2 yes, 1 no situation. And when one person overrides the other, it's unsurprisingly going to damage their relationship beyond repair and negatively impact the upbringing of the child. \n\nShe only has herself to blame because her husband made it clear he wasn't interested in having a child.", "Yes but unless you assumed OP was willfully misleading her husband about her birth control, which would be a really extreme assumption, then any pregnancy would have been a two person effort.", "And neither of those is allowed on this sub.", "I agree the pudding was cooked at that point. I just think choosing to pursue IVF given the volatility of their relationship as explained was extremely unwise.", "You CLEARLY are blind because there is a whole paragraph about doing IVF. That or you're a Misogynist who hates women", "Reproductive autonomy for all genders is most definitely allowed, and encouraged, in this sub.", "Please read the rules.  No one is allowed to ask for judgement or to judge someone based on their decision to conceive, abort, give birth, etc.", "You\u2019re misconstruing my comment. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m judging OP for. I\u2019m judging OP for planning to have a child with someone who did not want one. I didn\u2019t mention anything about any of those things.", "She had a child by conceiving and birthing one, which you've admitted you are judging her for.  This is not allowed on AITA.", "Again, nope. Planning to have a child with someone who has made it explicitly clear they do not want one is unethical.", "ESH. Why did you bring a child into this mess? You admit to only staying with your husband so you can have a family unit. Do you even hear how crazy that sounds? Your poor kid is going to be raised by two people who don\u2019t even like each other and it sounds like you\u2019ll be arguing non stop. Nothing about this is healthy or good for your child.", "ESH\n\nThis kid\u2019s name is the least of anyone\u2019s problems.", "ESH y\u2019all are both bots", "Your child is an newborn. if you are cooing to change the name, do it NOW.  It is more complex the older the cild gets.", "File the paperwork and while you're there file for divorce, custody, and child support because you two are clearly awful together. Get this shit sorted before the kid is old enough to know what's going on. ESH", "Product of a toxic marriage, and agree 100%. I used to beg my mom to leave my dad.", "She did edit the post. Last paragraph as of right now, starting with FYI", "Fair, and infertility can put a healthy marriage on the rocks before they even get to IVF.  But I don't think she could have expected her husband would turn on a baby after everything they went through to get one.  \n\nAll things considered, this is a mess.  OP should take the kid, leave, and change *both* of their names."]}
