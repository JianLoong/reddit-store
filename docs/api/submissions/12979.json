Things have gone well; we get along well so far and I really care about her and hope things work out with us.\n\nAnyway she recently invited me to come over and have dinner with her parents at their home.  She still lives with them for now. We are getting more serious and they wanted to meet me. If it's relevant her parents are Indian immigrants to the US and I am white.\n\nSo, I thought it was a completely casual meeting and I wore an Iron Maiden T-shirt. I do happen to like the band but that's not even why I wore it; that's just how I dress and that shirt just happened to be clean that day. I went and met her parents and thought we'd had a good meeting.\n\nHowever my girlfriend is NOT happy with me. She feels as if me dressing in a T-Shirt rather than a nicer button-up shirt was bad enough, but that wearing a shirt with skulls on it was--in her words--\"just obnoxious.\"\n\nI honestly just dressed for the meeting the way I usually do and didn't even think about it. I think that if she had certain standards that she should have communicated them to me beforehand. But she thinks that what I did was \"obviously stupid and inappropriate\" and that I should have known better. Is she right or is she being too critical?", "created_utc": 1679566085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zfpm0/aita_for_wearing_an_iron_maiden_tshirt_to_my/", "score": 12312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Surely you own a nicer shirt than an Iron Maiden tshirt, being an adult and all.", "YTA. Try to put a bit more thought into your attire when meeting people for the first time. Especially a girlfriend's parents. \n\nShe didn't need to communicate her standards. You need to address your standards. Don't blame her for your lack of them. It's all on you.", "YTA.   Yeah, dude.  C'mon.   High school kids have more sense than that.  I realize the world is in \"take me as I am\" mode, but the reality is meeting the parents is a big deal.  If you don't even put the most basic effort into it, you're just telling them, and your gf the relationship isn't that important to you.", "YTA. 1. You always ask the new girlfriend what to wear to meet the parents. It shows you care. And 2. whether you like it or not, you didn\u2019t do your homework on Indian parents. They are EXTREMELY conservative when it comes to such things (have you never been to the movies or watched The Office?). Tradition is a huge part of their DNA, as their culture goes back over 10,000 years, whereas American culture only goes back 250 years. Tell her you\u2019re sorry, and have her go with you to pick out some nice clothes for you to wear next time. It will show her and the parents you care and are making the effort.\n\nEDIT. I apologize if any of this is offensive. I was trying to be humorous. Obviously, I don\u2019t think Indian culture can be summed up by the media, but some Indians got it and like my comment. I was trying to help the poor guy think about it a little deeper, that\u2019s all.", "Yeah she is right. Wearing whatever happened to be clean, without thinking through the social significance of meeting her parents for the first time, is kind of an arsehole move. It says you don't care enough about her to be conscious of the impression you make. YTA for the thoughtlessness.", "Lol my husband would love it if our kids date showed up in a Maiden shirt. He'd probably be in one too. But I'm guessing most parents won't think the same.", "NAH. Sounds like you wore your usual clothes and your girlfriend expected you to dress more formally. My partner (white Australian) would do the same! This seems like a miscommunication of expectations from both sides. Having said that, as an Indian woman, I can tell you that Indian parents are super overprotective of their daughters and can have rather odd hang ups about things that wouldn't occur to a white person. The incident re the t shirt is a case in point. You may benefit from a discussion with your girlfriend about her expectations when meeting her family, attending cultural events etc. And by the way, you seem to have great taste in music!", "I\u2019m amazed at the people acting like meeting the parents is a one way street here and that he is expected to be 100% deferential. \n\nIf there was an expectation it should have been communicated to him. \n\nAnd in the absence of that, it is perfectly valid for an adult to dress however they feel comfortable. They\u2019re all adults. They don\u2019t get to dictate how other adults dress, not do they get to dictate who she dates (and if they do, well I\u2019d like to get that out in the open as soon as possible personally). \n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP, and the people insinuating that what you did was childish are the ones ironically being most childish.

There's nothing wrong with wearing an Iron Maiden tee unless you were meeting at a nice bar or restaurant (because then it should be obvious to dress a bit smarter).\n\nHaving said that, girlfriend isn't *really* TA for hoping you'd dress smarter. That's reasonable. She probably should've just said something beforehand though.", "I mean. There is a thing called first impression. But a small bit communication would helped for miles. I say both parties are at fault. To a degree", "I don't see the problem. Plenty of people wear casual clothing the first time they meet someone.

If the genders were reversed a lot of people would call the guy controlling and policing what the girl was wearing. \nWe\u2019re in a modern society where formalities, etc don\u2019t matter as much as they used to.

She should have mentioned it beforehand if she wanted you to dress more formally.", "I'm 48 and if my daughter brought home a boy wearing such a shirt I'd give him a good talking to...about the Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. Methinks those calling OP immature need to grow up and move into the 21st century.", "NTA  Looks are just pretentious.. I would much rather have someone show up the same way as they would when with my daughter. That way I can actually judge what type of person my daughter is with, whether she's in good hands and whether they align in interests and have potential for a future. Of course it's nice to try and impress me as the parent in this situation but yeah Im not dating  my daughter is and if she's fine with him looking like this then I have nothing to say to that. \n\neveryone saying they're adults and supposed to do adult things like dressing up for parents, but tbh holding on to old school cultural nonsensical values is more immature and closed minded.\n\nthen again if OP doesnt want to deal with this stuff then he shouldnt date this type of person.\nIn the end you should've asked what the expectations were that I agree on. \nBut yea dressing up for an impression like it's a job interview imo is just misleading and not true to your character.\n\nThe impression should be a representation of the person that their dealing with, not just an image that fits their framework.\n\nIf they have a problem with the band or your taste of music then they are not the one for you as music, looks, taste, etc  don't say nothing on whether you're a good or bad person.", "NTA - really surprised at how many are calling you TA. As long as your clothes were clean and ironed, I don't see the problem. Surely GF's parents would care more about whether you're a nice person and polite?

Every family and culture is different, as are how they view first impressions (Especially with parents, and ESPECIALLY with standards for prospective male and female partners). Different people look for different things, and in general, wearing nice clothes (And not a band tee) gives at least a good first impression. That's first impressions 101.\n\nEspecially considering your GF is Indian, which as some wise commenter pointed out is a 10,000 year old culture, this is a very important thing as this first meeting will stick in their mind for awhile as their impression of you, until you do something more outstanding to prove otherwise. It's not even just a culture thing as well, most people are wired like that.\n\nView it like a concert. Everyone needs a ticket to get in, and nice clothes are the ticket. You can then show how awesome you are as a person once you get in. Believe me, I hate dressing up in most nice clothes and prefer to wear what's comfortable myself, but you have to know that some occasions call for you to appear nice to others.", "Nobody is the asshole. Your gf shouldve told you before not after, if she wanted you to do something different. And you should obviously bare in mind first impressions n all that. That being said, everyone's acting like we live I a simulation. I've known partners parents to be tatted up and wear dope shit themselves.", "NAH you simply should\u2019ve known better. dressing nice to meet a significant others parents isn\u2019t a new concept.", "i don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole but i do think it was a bit stupid of you. i wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to wear anything besides their normal casual clothes to meet *my* parents but i think you know your girlfriend and if you had thought about it had probably come to the conclusion that she might have different expectations of you. \n\nso NAH but apologise to her and moving forward  just be aware that not all families/cultures work the same and ask her beforehand what she expects of you so you can act accordingly", "ESH. Families and cultures are different and expect different things. If you came to meet my parents for the first time in an Iron Maiden tshirt, my dad would marry you before I could. She knows how you dress, so if she had a concern, she could have told you this. You also could have asked. Neither of you made the effort to set expectations.\n\nYou guys are still pretty young and people in general aren't always great about communication, so it is understandable, but avoidable. If you want this to work (or any relationship in your future) you BOTH need to do more of it. The problem is that you both made assumptions and neither of you thought to talk to the other. As someone with 21 years of successful marriage under my belt, I can tell you that you can't assume ANYTHING. Talk, talk, talk- even if something seems obvious.\n\n I'm a 42 year old white chick from a small, non religuous family in Texas and my husband is a 50 year old black man from Chicago with a huge family, most of whom are Jehovah's Witnesses or Baptist. As much as we have in common, we are from fundamentally different worlds. If neither of us had bothered to learn about each other and made assumptions colored by our own backgrounds, we would not still be together and happy. \n\nBOTH of you need to stop making assumptions and start asking each other, even if it seems silly. You're early in, so ask about everything-small and large. Truly get to know each other, deeply, as human beings. Get out of your own behinds and realize that people are different and not everyone thinks like you.", "NTA *however* you do need to make the effort when meeting your partner's parents for the first time. It's not a casual affair and you should have put a bit more thought into it. With my family, that would have been perfectly fine, but your girlfriend has Indian parents so the culture is different. Wearing something with fiery skulls on it was not the best choice. Just shoving on a nice ish shirt would have shown you cared, gave some consideration and demonstrated respect. Best apologise and put on something smarter.", "Wow. Maybe where I\u2019m from it\u2019s different but unless you\u2019re meeting the parents in a fancy restaurant or some other formal setting, it\u2019s expected that you just turn up as you normally would. Dress how you dress any other day. My parents want to meet my boyfriend. Not a version of him that only comes out when he\u2019s expected to play pretend.\n\nThis is wild to me.\n\nHowever, this could be what\u2019s expected in her culture. And while that\u2019s fine, maybe she could have warned you. I\u2019m gonna go with NAH.", "NTA. But maybe lacking in a sense of social nuance, LOL. You should be able to come back from it if you generally treat them with respect. The sense that you don't respect them is the problem, not the shirt.", "NTA you are right she should have used her words about her expectations", "I agree a shirt with skulls on is a little much, but I would never expect a partner to wear a button down just to meet my parents if that wasn\u2019t something they wear normally. Both my ex and my husband met my parents wearing a T-shirt and shorts because that\u2019s what they wear. Hell, my husband owns exactly one button down that came out for our elopement and that\u2019s it. \n\nPeople make the \u2018meeting\u2019 into way too big a deal in my opinion, my ex met them in passing because he was picking me up and I wasn\u2019t waiting outside, not arranged, just hey there, I\u2019m new bf, nice to meet you. The only reason my husband met them in an arranged way is because we live overseas and they were coming to stay with us.", ">If it's relevant her parents are Indian immigrants to the US and I am white.\n\nThis is probably the most important information.  From that alone, you can assume that they're probably more conservative in terms of dating/courting.

I wear band t shirts. We're both in jeans or t shirts most of the time, if not something more casual. But you're supposed to go with the \"Sunday best\" approach when meeting family members. I wore a sun dress when I met my husband's family (every time, because I met them in stages) and my husband wore khaki slacks and a tucked in golf polo when he met mine. It's the go to for every event at that level, so we don't even have to think about it.\n\nIf you're not sure what to wear to a social event, Google it. There are guides on this. Do yourself a favor, as soon as you can, go out and buy:\n- 2 short sleeve button up golf polos\n- 2 long sleeve button up dress shirts, preferably white\n- 1 pair of khaki slacks\n- 1 pair of navy slacks\n- 2 pairs of black slacks", "I can\u2019t imagine meeting a significant other\u2019s parents and NOT being worried about first impressions.", "Yeah, you lack some common sense.

You're 28, why would you think meeting a gf's parents for the first time would be appropriate to wear an Iron Maiden t-shirt?  Unless of course you don't see this relationship going anywhere, then you probably don't care what her parents think of you.  To her, introducing you to her parents is probably a big deal and feels that your relationship is hoping to go somewhere other than dating.  She has every right to be unhappy with you.  Any person with half a brain should not have to be told how to dress when meeting someone's parents.

Here in the US, you have people wearing club attire to weddings and jeans to funerals. No one says anything to your face, but they talk about you behind your back. Your gf actually had the courtesy and respect for you to tell you that your lack of care came off as disrespectful. Again, think of it like any other event.

Even as an American, I'd have questioned your choice, so if they were fully \"Americanized\" culturally, it would likely be less important but still relevant. You could have gotten away with a more basic or bland shirt, but a polo would have been best. I mean, it was dinner, not a cookout. I agree you shouldn't be ashamed of who you are, but this was important to her. She obviously cares for you, so I'd apologize and put it to rest.

BUT, and here it is FIRST IMPRESSIONS MATTER.\n\nYou done gone fucked up, and you know it. If you really cared for your gf, and you knew they were traditional Indian parents,  you should of thought ahead and planned to wear something nice.

I'd have said NAH but she didn't have to be so rude about it. Y'all have different expectations is all. And you both could have communicated better. You could have asked more about what to expect and she could have told you, especially if she thought it needed to be different than normal. \n\nMy partner wears exclusively t shirts in his free time and I'm 99.9% sure he was dressed casually when he met my family for the first time. Didn't bother me, didn't bother them. They're not very formal folks, really. I probably did dress up a bit when meeting his family, but at the time I was into being dressy on the regular. I don't think they'd have blinked if I'd shown up in yoga pants and a t shirt. \n\nBut that's us and how our families are. So I think the idea of \"people SHOULD dress up when meeting parents\" is a bit silly, at least in a very general sense. Not everyone is going to have the same \"requirements\" and that's why it should be discussed beforehand. (Though imo I think it's silly to have judgments based on people's clothing, so even if my parents had had an issue with it, I sure wouldn't have. I'd have said \"dad, it's a t shirt, take a chill pill please.\") And we were 24 (me) and 34 (him) when we got together. \n\nAll that to say there's nothing inherently wrong with wearing an Iron Maiden t shirt.

I called up my gf (now wife) and asked what her mom's favorite flowers were AND her dad's favorite beer. I showed up with a bouquet of red roses for my gf (again, now wife), a bouquet of yellow roses for her mom, and a six pack for her dad.

Cut to I'm at Walmart with my friend back in our high school days. She's a big time Christian as I was too but she was more a fundamentalist hard core Christian. So at Walmart I see Danny. He approaches eating bologna straight out of a pack he just bought. I hug him and introduce him to my Friend. He hugs her (he's a hugger) and I notice his tee. It had an image of two naked women, one giving the other oral. Most graphic tee I ever saw, eating his raw bologna out the pack, he offered her a bite and the most mortified look washed over my friend's face. I still get a kick out of that memory.

Best case, he upset just gf. Neither option is good.\n\nFor me, it's a respect thing. Like, I'm not expecting him to wear a tux or a suit, even a full sleeve dress shirt could be a lot. He doesn't need to *not* be himself, he just needs to look like he put in the effort. Like a job interview, I don't expect the person to wear black tie, but I do expect them to look like they give a shit about getting the job.

She didn't say anything to you beforehand either. I'm not sure why everyone is so mad at you for not telepathically inferring what your girlfriend's standards are.

There is nothing wrong with being yourself when meeting parents, especially since you are a grown adult and not a kid. However, that is also not going to be for everyone. Some people will always expect you to present a more formal face in these types of situations. Neither side is wrong, it\u2019s just preferences.

So long as you ain't rolling in mud right before you come in and shake hands, it doesn't matter. \n\n\nMeeting the parents, even in a serious relationship, is not always considered a monumental event. Where I'm from it's not uncommon to just accidentally run into each other at the store and have an impromptu introduction. No preparing or anything.

Anyway, they never shut up about it.\n\nOne day the millionaire's son invited some people out to idr what sort of event (I was maybe 12 at the time) and afterward we were going to go out to eat at a 2x Michelin starred restaurant. To my parents, that meant it HAD to be fancy. They dressed us all up in the most formal attire they could rent. My mom's in an evening gown. Stepdad is in a literal tux.\n\nThe place was... a little fancy, but not formal. Most men are wearing regular workaday business suits or sport coats. Women are wearing day dresses or pantsuits (yay 90s). No one blinked an eye when we all met up outside but my mother was visibly uncomfortable. \n\nTo make matters worse, she'd wanted to *prepare* us for the rich-folks lifestyle so she'd warned us about all the exotic foods we'd see on the menu, and to \"maybe just order a steak or something\". Well... her horrible description of escargot terrified my then 5 year old sister that lil sis didn't want to *think* about a menu.\n\nThere was plenty of foods that we'd had a million times so if my mother hadn't panicked there would have been no issue. \n\nMy sister sees the waiter and immediately demands a peanut butter sandwich, koolaid and a cookie.\n\nThe waiter says he doesn't know if there is any peanut butter and jelly, but he'll check.\n\n*No one else cared* but mother was so embarrassed, she starts *hissing* across the table at my sister that she'll eat whatever mama orders for her, or \"so help me God...\"\n\nSo of course baby sis doubles down and starts demanding pb&j.

(I'm trying to pretend I'm a princess, dressed in my gown, who doesn't notice any of these lowly peasants I'm unrelated to.)\n\nWaiter comes back over looking more and more terrified as he realizes what's happening. Says they unfortunately do not have any peanut butter. \n\nMillionaire's son whispers something to the waiter, then says \"don't worry it's handled\". My mother is *fuming* but doesn't want to embarrass herself any more so she shuts up. MS tells little sis she's going to have the best ever pb&j. And everyone else orders.\n\nWhen the food comes out... Millionaire's son had sent the waiter off with a couple hundred dollars to \"run to the store for anything you don't have\", and they'd come back with groceries... \n\nSis got a pb&j. It was three layers of the thickest, freshest bread I've ever seen, pan fried. Between the layers, regular old peanut butter, but also 4 kinds of jam. All garnished with chopped peanuts and some sort of drizzle over it. \n\nAnd koolaid and a cookie.\n\nEveryone gets their food, waiter walks off, and lil sis looks at the sandwich. Just stares at it for like 5 minutes. Then she says, \"Ew.\" And she pushes it away. My mother snatched her up and disappeared outside. \n\nEveryone else ate their food, and they never came back in.

Women who were merely well-off saved up and bought dresses made of silk edged with lace and pearls, but Lady Ramkin was so rich she could afford to stomp around the place in rubber boots and a tweed skirt that had belonged to her mother. She was so rich she could afford to live on biscuits and cheese sandwiches. She was so rich she lived in three rooms in a thirty-four-roomed mansion; the rest of them were full of very expensive and very old furniture, covered in dust sheets.\"\n\n\"The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an *affordable* pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and *would still have wet feet*.
