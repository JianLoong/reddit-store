Things have gone well; we get along well so far and I really care about her and hope things work out with us.\n\nAnyway she recently invited me to come over and have dinner with her parents at their home.  She still lives with them for now. We are getting more serious and they wanted to meet me. If it's relevant her parents are Indian immigrants to the US and I am white.\n\nSo, I thought it was a completely casual meeting and I wore an Iron Maiden T-shirt. I do happen to like the band but that's not even why I wore it; that's just how I dress and that shirt just happened to be clean that day. I went and met her parents and thought we'd had a good meeting.\n\nHowever my girlfriend is NOT happy with me. She feels as if me dressing in a T-Shirt rather than a nicer button-up shirt was bad enough, but that wearing a shirt with skulls on it was--in her words--\"just obnoxious.\"\n\nI honestly just dressed for the meeting the way I usually do and didn't even think about it. I think that if she had certain standards that she should have communicated them to me beforehand. But she thinks that what I did was \"obviously stupid and inappropriate\" and that I should have known better. Is she right or is she being too critical?", "created_utc": 1679566085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zfpm0/aita_for_wearing_an_iron_maiden_tshirt_to_my/", "score": 1043, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Surely you own a nicer shirt than an Iron Maiden tshirt, being an adult and all.", "YTA. Try to put a bit more thought into your attire when meeting people for the first time. Especially a girlfriend's parents. \n\nShe didn't need to communicate her standards. You need to address your standards. Don't blame her for your lack of them. It's all on you.", "YTA.   Yeah, dude.  C'mon.   High school kids have more sense than that.  I realize the world is in \"take me as I am\" mode, but the reality is meeting the parents is a big deal.  If you don't even put the most basic effort into it, you're just telling them, and your gf the relationship isn't that important to you.", "YTA. 1. You always ask the new girlfriend what to wear to meet the parents. It shows you care. And 2. whether you like it or not, you didn\u2019t do your homework on Indian parents. They are EXTREMELY conservative when it comes to such things (have you never been to the movies or watched The Office?). Tradition is a huge part of their DNA, as their culture goes back over 10,000 years, whereas American culture only goes back 250 years. Tell her you\u2019re sorry, and have her go with you to pick out some nice clothes for you to wear next time. It will show her and the parents you care and are making the effort.", "Yeah she is right. Wearing whatever happened to be clean, without thinking through the social significance of meeting her parents for the first time, is kind of an arsehole move. It says you don't care enough about her to be conscious of the impression you make. YTA for the thoughtlessness.", "Lol my husband would love it if our kids date showed up in a Maiden shirt. He'd probably be in one too. But I'm guessing most parents won't think the same.", "NAH. Sounds like you wore your usual clothes and your girlfriend expected you to dress more formally. My partner (white Australian) would do the same! This seems like a miscommunication of expectations from both sides. Having said that, as an Indian woman, I can tell you that Indian parents are super overprotective of their daughters and can have rather odd hang ups about things that wouldn't occur to a white person. The incident re the t shirt is a case in point. You may benefit from a discussion with your girlfriend about her expectations when meeting her family, attending cultural events etc. And by the way, you seem to have great taste in music!", "I\u2019m amazed at the people acting like meeting the parents is a one way street here and that he is expected to be 100% deferential. \n\nIf there was an expectation it should have been communicated to him. \n\nAnd in the absence of that, it is perfectly valid for an adult to dress however they feel comfortable. They\u2019re all adults. They don\u2019t get to dictate how other adults dress, not do they get to dictate who she dates (and if they do, well I\u2019d like to get that out in the open as soon as possible personally). \n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP, and the people insinuating that what you did was childish are the ones ironically being most childish. Adults don\u2019t whine about what other adults they know are wearing. Better to set the expectation that you don\u2019t dress up in formalwear in casual settings.", "I don't think anyone's the arsehole here.

Unpopular opinion but NTA.", "YTA.  Dude you are meeting her parents for the first time, these are people you want to impress and want to show them that you take them seriously, you could\u2019ve worn something better.

A dinner in-home just doesn\u2019t seem like a formal event worthy of dressing up to me, unless it\u2019s specified. My SO and I are in our mid 20s and I wore a t-shirt/leggings to meet his parents while he wore a t-shirt/jeans to meet my dad. We\u2019re long term, cohabitating, and actively planning our future so it definitely isn\u2019t that we weren\u2019t serious enough to dress up when meeting families.

I\u2019m from Australia so maybe it\u2019s different.", "NTA for the outfit necessarily (a lot of parents wouldn't be judgemental) but YTA for not asking your gf what might be appropriate to wear.\n\nEdit: no I've changed my mind, she knows her parents and their opinions and she also knows how you dress day to day.

It must have crossed your mind.\n\nUnless you are absolutely oblivious in regards to social to conventions it *did* cross your mind, but you decided against it, because that shirt is what *you* are most comfortable in. And if they had not liked you, you'd have had a wonderful, failsafe defense: \"I was just being myself, I won't play a character for them.\" \nIt sounds good on paper, but it is just insecurity speaking. \n\nWhen meeting your maybe-future-inlaws it is courtesy to make an effort. \nIt's not even about the inlaws, it's about  your *partner*.

I'm almost 40, work a very professional corporate job and own like 20 band T shirts, Dr who and anything else I like. I dress how I want on my time. If people want me to look like something else, they should communicate it or set expectations. If this is how he dresses and she knows it, she should have mentioned it. It's weird people think you can't wear cool t shirts anymore because you're an adult.", "NAH. South Asian in his late 30s here. I think your girlfriend sees this as her being relatively more invested in the relationship, because you wore whichever clean t-shirt you had lying around to meet her parents for dinner. For you, it's just how you dress to meet anyone. I can see both sides.", "I am very confused at all the Y T A votes. My parents wouldn't give a fuck. Neither would I. Maybe it's because I'm aromantic and don't date. Or some cultural difference.\n\nNot giving a judgement because this whole thing is just confusing me.", "NAH. Cultural differences sometimes come up this way.", "NTA I hate people that judge others by the way they dress, it's not a fucking job interview and if it was so important she should have told you before hand.\nI just can't fathom expecting my newly found gf to wear heels and a fucking dress to meet my parents, even more so, why lie and dress like the person you clearly are not?", "NAH everyone freaking out over a t shirt if it was a big deal she should have said something, be yourself dude I wouldn't want to be with someone who made me dress a certain way what a double standard.", "NTA.\n\nIf your girlfriend expected you to dress a certain way, perhaps she should've communicated that to you?", "NAH\n\nWhy dress a way you wouldn't normally, unless advised to? There's nothing wrong with wearing an Iron Maiden tee unless you were meeting at a nice bar or restaurant (because then it should be obvious to dress a bit smarter).\n\nHaving said that, girlfriend isn't *really* TA for hoping you'd dress smarter. That's reasonable. She probably should've just said something beforehand though.", "I mean. There is a thing called first impression. But a small bit communication would helped for miles. I say both parties are at fault. To a degree", "I don't see the problem. Plenty of people wear casual clothing the first time they meet someone. I might have stuck a shirt over the top but that's just me, I definitely wouldn't consider you an asshole for it, and I DEFINITELY wouldn't overreact like that if my daughters boyfriend turned up in a t-shirt.", "NTA. If the genders were reversed a lot of people would call the guy controlling and policing what the girl was wearing. \nWe\u2019re in a modern society where formalities, etc don\u2019t matter as much as they used to.

She should have mentioned it beforehand if she wanted you to dress more formally.", "I'm 48 and if my daughter brought home a boy wearing such a shirt I'd give him a good talking to...about the Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. Methinks those calling OP immature need to grow up and move into the 21st century.", "NTA  Looks are just pretentious.. I would much rather have someone show up the same way as they would when with my daughter. That way I can actually judge what type of person my daughter is with, whether she's in good hands and whether they align in interests and have potential for a future. Of course it's nice to try and impress me as the parent in this situation but yeah Im not dating  my daughter is and if she's fine with him looking like this then I have nothing to say to that. \n\neveryone saying they're adults and supposed to do adult things like dressing up for parents, but tbh holding on to old school cultural nonsensical values is more immature and closed minded.\n\nthen again if OP doesnt want to deal with this stuff then he shouldnt date this type of person.\nIn the end you should've asked what the expectations were that I agree on. \nBut yea dressing up for an impression like it's a job interview imo is just misleading and not true to your character.\n\nThe impression should be a representation of the person that their dealing with, not just an image that fits their framework.\n\nIf they have a problem with the band or your taste of music then they are not the one for you as music, looks, taste, etc  don't say nothing on whether you're a good or bad person.", "NTA - really surprised at how many are calling you TA. As long as your clothes were clean and ironed, I don't see the problem. Surely GF's parents would care more about whether you're a nice person and polite?

Dress how you want dude. She should have communicated to dress up nicer. Don't listen to these people against you. You did nothing wrong.", "I genuinely think this is a little culture difference. I don't know how americans do it, but what might come off as some casual just-being-myself moment of dressing is not similar in eastern cultures when it comes to meeting parents. You could have asked her what she expected, but she could have communicated it. I'd go with ESH", "I wouldn't call you an asshole, just a naive fool.  First impressions are huge and unless she told you her parents are old metalheads an Iron Maiden shirt is not going to make a strong one.", "Umm, Idk if you are technically the asshole, but that was very very dumb.", "More info: Was it, at least, the GOOD Iron Maiden t-shirt, the one without the holes?", "I will say slight YTA here, only because you should have asked her in the first place if casual clothes were ok. Every family and culture is different, as are how they view first impressions (Especially with parents, and ESPECIALLY with standards for prospective male and female partners). Different people look for different things, and in general, wearing nice clothes (And not a band tee) gives at least a good first impression. That's first impressions 101.\n\nEspecially considering your GF is Indian, which as some wise commenter pointed out is a 10,000 year old culture, this is a very important thing as this first meeting will stick in their mind for awhile as their impression of you, until you do something more outstanding to prove otherwise. It's not even just a culture thing as well, most people are wired like that.\n\nView it like a concert. Everyone needs a ticket to get in, and nice clothes are the ticket. You can then show how awesome you are as a person once you get in. Believe me, I hate dressing up in most nice clothes and prefer to wear what's comfortable myself, but you have to know that some occasions call for you to appear nice to others.", "Nobody is the asshole. Your gf shouldve told you before not after, if she wanted you to do something different. And you should obviously bare in mind first impressions n all that. That being said, everyone's acting like we live I a simulation. I've known partners parents to be tatted up and wear dope shit themselves.", "NAH you simply should\u2019ve known better. dressing nice to meet a significant others parents isn\u2019t a new concept.", "i don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole but i do think it was a bit stupid of you. i wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to wear anything besides their normal casual clothes to meet *my* parents but i think you know your girlfriend and if you had thought about it had probably come to the conclusion that she might have different expectations of you. \n\nso NAH but apologise to her and moving forward  just be aware that not all families/cultures work the same and ask her beforehand what she expects of you so you can act accordingly", "ESH. Families and cultures are different and expect different things. If you came to meet my parents for the first time in an Iron Maiden tshirt, my dad would marry you before I could. She knows how you dress, so if she had a concern, she could have told you this. You also could have asked. Neither of you made the effort to set expectations.\n\nYou guys are still pretty young and people in general aren't always great about communication, so it is understandable, but avoidable. If you want this to work (or any relationship in your future) you BOTH need to do more of it. The problem is that you both made assumptions and neither of you thought to talk to the other. As someone with 21 years of successful marriage under my belt, I can tell you that you can't assume ANYTHING. Talk, talk, talk- even if something seems obvious.\n\n I'm a 42 year old white chick from a small, non religuous family in Texas and my husband is a 50 year old black man from Chicago with a huge family, most of whom are Jehovah's Witnesses or Baptist. As much as we have in common, we are from fundamentally different worlds. If neither of us had bothered to learn about each other and made assumptions colored by our own backgrounds, we would not still be together and happy. \n\nBOTH of you need to stop making assumptions and start asking each other, even if it seems silly. You're early in, so ask about everything-small and large. Truly get to know each other, deeply, as human beings. Get out of your own behinds and realize that people are different and not everyone thinks like you.", "NTA *however* you do need to make the effort when meeting your partner's parents for the first time. It's not a casual affair and you should have put a bit more thought into it. With my family, that would have been perfectly fine, but your girlfriend has Indian parents so the culture is different. Wearing something with fiery skulls on it was not the best choice. Just shoving on a nice ish shirt would have shown you cared, gave some consideration and demonstrated respect. Best apologise and put on something smarter.", "Wow. Maybe where I\u2019m from it\u2019s different but unless you\u2019re meeting the parents in a fancy restaurant or some other formal setting, it\u2019s expected that you just turn up as you normally would. Dress how you dress any other day. My parents want to meet my boyfriend. Not a version of him that only comes out when he\u2019s expected to play pretend.\n\nThis is wild to me.\n\nHowever, this could be what\u2019s expected in her culture. And while that\u2019s fine, maybe she could have warned you. I\u2019m gonna go with NAH.", "NTA. But maybe lacking in a sense of social nuance, LOL. You should be able to come back from it if you generally treat them with respect. The sense that you don't respect them is the problem, not the shirt.", "NTA you are right she should have used her words about her expectations", "I agree a shirt with skulls on is a little much, but I would never expect a partner to wear a button down just to meet my parents if that wasn\u2019t something they wear normally. Both my ex and my husband met my parents wearing a T-shirt and shorts because that\u2019s what they wear. Hell, my husband owns exactly one button down that came out for our elopement and that\u2019s it. \n\nPeople make the \u2018meeting\u2019 into way too big a deal in my opinion, my ex met them in passing because he was picking me up and I wasn\u2019t waiting outside, not arranged, just hey there, I\u2019m new bf, nice to meet you. The only reason my husband met them in an arranged way is because we live overseas and they were coming to stay with us.", ">If it's relevant her parents are Indian immigrants to the US and I am white.\n\nThis is probably the most important information.  From that alone, you can assume that they're probably more conservative in terms of dating/courting.

I wear band t shirts. We're both in jeans or t shirts most of the time, if not something more casual. But you're supposed to go with the \"Sunday best\" approach when meeting family members. I wore a sun dress when I met my husband's family (every time, because I met them in stages) and my husband wore khaki slacks and a tucked in golf polo when he met mine. It's the go to for every event at that level, so we don't even have to think about it.\n\nIf you're not sure what to wear to a social event, Google it. There are guides on this. Do yourself a favor, as soon as you can, go out and buy:\n- 2 short sleeve button up golf polos\n- 2 long sleeve button up dress shirts, preferably white\n- 1 pair of khaki slacks\n- 1 pair of navy slacks\n- 2 pairs of black slacks", "I can\u2019t imagine meeting a significant other\u2019s parents and NOT being worried about first impressions.", "Yeah, you lack some common sense.

Did you at least take a gift to the parents for hosting and being in their home for the first time?!?!", "ESH, you both lacked communication. She could have expressed her expectations, and you could have asked her what her parents are like. These are basic communication skills that could have saved you both from this issue. Granted, I personally would have assumed to dress nice casual. I think a lot of people would automatically do the same. That doesn't mean dress up completely, but don't wear a band t-shirt.

You're 28, why would you think meeting a gf's parents for the first time would be appropriate to wear an Iron Maiden t-shirt?  Unless of course you don't see this relationship going anywhere, then you probably don't care what her parents think of you.  To her, introducing you to her parents is probably a big deal and feels that your relationship is hoping to go somewhere other than dating.  She has every right to be unhappy with you.  Any person with half a brain should not have to be told how to dress when meeting someone's parents.  The only exception I would make is if you were actually a famous rockstar then it could probably be passable.

I don't think they'd have blinked if I'd shown up in yoga pants and a t shirt. \n\nBut that's us and how our families are. So I think the idea of \"people SHOULD dress up when meeting parents\" is a bit silly, at least in a very general sense. Not everyone is going to have the same \"requirements\" and that's why it should be discussed beforehand. (Though imo I think it's silly to have judgments based on people's clothing, so even if my parents had had an issue with it, I sure wouldn't have. I'd have said \"dad, it's a t shirt, take a chill pill please.\") And we were 24 (me) and 34 (him) when we got together. \n\nAll that to say there's nothing inherently wrong with wearing an Iron Maiden t shirt.

You\u2019re trying to make a good impression and that\u2019s how you thought you could do it? Also another loss of points for not understanding how much Indian culture puts on impressions (right or wrong); a poor first impression can be hard to come back from.

The phrase \"dress to impress\" should come immediately to mind. If you want to have a long term relationship with your GF, it is extremely important to make a good impression on those whose opinions she values, which goes doubly for parents. When I met my wife's parents for the first time, we had been dating about 2.5 months (iirc). I dressed up in khakis and a rugby long-sleeved polo-style shirt. I called up my gf (now wife) and asked what her mom's favorite flowers were AND her dad's favorite beer. I showed up with a bouquet of red roses for my gf (again, now wife), a bouquet of yellow roses for her mom, and a six pack for her dad. I immediately earned favor with both her folks and became a family legend.", "YTA. You're 28 not 18.

I grew up with a kid named Danny in the American South. He's from a small blink if you miss it rural community called Rosine and he's a real character. He's out there but a nice guy. Cut to I'm at Walmart with my friend back in our high school days. She's a big time Christian as I was too but she was more a fundamentalist hard core Christian. So at Walmart I see Danny. He approaches eating bologna straight out of a pack he just bought. I hug him and introduce him to my Friend. He hugs her (he's a hugger) and I notice his tee. It had an image of two naked women, one giving the other oral. Most graphic tee I ever saw, eating his raw bologna out the pack, he offered her a bite and the most mortified look washed over my friend's face. I still get a kick out of that memory. Now that was an an appropriate tee shirt.

I could absolutely respect the fact a guy came over and said this is me sir nice to meet you.", "I agree with you. While OP was oblivious, it was also the GFs responsibility to communicate her family's expectations. \n\nIn the end this is a situation of bad communication on both sides and should be easy to resolve.", "\"Blood which my parents might think is cool\" was your husband 13 lol?

And I have their concert t-shirt. But there is a time and a place to wear it. \n\nWhen I am meeting my kids in-laws for the first time, that\u2019s not time. For a casual meeting a pair of jeans a blouse and for me a pair of boots, husband wore jeans, and a polo shirt and tennis shoes.   If we were out hiking I might wear Cheap Trick, or Night Ranger or even Judas Priest. I wouldn\u2019t wear something that would shock them or insult them.", "I don't think the \"immature\" refers to the actual band t-shirt. My husband and I are wearing them a lot and we are in our mid 40s. But at 28, first you should have grown out of the mindset that your identity depends on your clothing (which wasn't the case here, but is often - not always - in teenage years). And second, you should have grasped the concept of situational clothing, as its considered a sign of respect that you put some thought into the way you dress because you see the occasion important. So, yes, if OP wanted to show that he respects the parents, he should have put some thought into it and dressed differently.

I guess if your best is a t-shirt that\u2019s just a difference in values. Regardless, OP is an adult and if it needs to be communicated to him to dress nice then he needs to grow up himself. His girlfriend is not is parent.", "Ha! They may not be Christian and don't care about others' popular belief in Satan. The skulls however mean death regardless of belief system.", "The key part of this is that the part that was visible was dressy, because you understood the social etiquette of the situation. \n\nSame with meeting (particularly Indian!) parents. There is a social etiquette behind that. You can whine about it, but if you want a good impression you follow the etiquette.", "Ew no. If that's not what my partner usually wears (which it's not) a polo shirt, jeans, and boots is gonna be so off putting. To me at least!", "Meeting parents is no way in the same ball park as a Funeral, wedding or Interview. It\u2019s hilarious that people care so much about a t-shirt when just meeting someone", "While I can agree there are more aggressive symbols/graphics than zombies, skulls, tanks and Satan just existing on a t shit. \n\nI can also recognize that those characters alone are aggressive for a large percentage of the population. lol they don\u2019t need to be violently ripping each other apart to be aggressive.", "It\u2019s always better to accidentally overdress than to show up looking like you couldn\u2019t give a shit. Plus the jokes provide good icebreakers lol.", "I knew my dude friend was serious about a girl when he asked our friend group if his outfits/hair/style were looking good. Pretty casual guy with a very casual workplace but willingly asking for help to appear mature and fashionable for his SO's family is pretty dang mature.", "My friends oldest daughter just brought a boy home for the first time last November. He wore a dress shirt and nice slacks and was overly polite and formal. The whole family absolutely cracked through his anxiety but for those initial meetings it's nice to show he cared and they're still together. My friend and his wife adore the kid, because he put in effort\n\n\nSomething OP doesn't seem to get.", "Weird or not, I would think that's so sweet because it shows you're nervous and care!", "Add to it that this is an inter-cultural relationship. Has he done *anything* to learn about the culture that she is coming from?", "I've heard that before. The most common saying around here is \"Were you raised in a barn?\" Lol.", "He upset his gf. That's kinda the definition of a relationship event \"not going well\".", "OP isn\u2019t very self-aware so his interpretation of the meeting isn\u2019t reliable. We do know his gf was extremely upset. To me that\u2019s pretty clear evidence he committed a social/cultural blunder. She knows her parents best so her being upset is pretty indicative it didn\u2019t go well. \n\nI defer to Indian people in this sub, but my experience with my Indian friends and neighbors are that they are incredibly kind and hospitable. They would never be rude directly to OP, but they will have something to say after the meeting. \n\nAlso, the sense I get are that her parents may not have been thrilled she was dating a white guy. Why? Because OP made a point of sharing ethnicity if it\u2019s relevant. It is. Her parents were probably very skeptical about him even before the meeting and he did nothing to help his situation.", "Absolutely. I need to treat my relationship with her with more love and care.", "So far we seem to have gotten past this. But if your prediction comes true I will certainly take my mistakes to heart.", "Agreed.  I'm 52, and my taste in music is pretty eclectic.  Plus I'm pagan, and a hot mess.  \nBut i definitely have taught both of my kids about dressing to the occasion and that first impressions are huge.", "Hell my husband AND myself do this even meeting our friends\u2019 family members and parents, especially with cultural differences, because *we care and want them to like us*. So I dress a bit more modestly, we hide a few more tattoos than we normally would, and wear something better than a tshirt! \n\nIt\u2019s not a colossal challenge to put in a smidge of extra effort when meeting new people who you want to like you", "That is not at all what OP did. Are you kidding me?", "I'm sure that seems noble in your head, but that's not how it works. Most people have higher standards than you and OP.", "Which was totally fine with me. I wear clothes to Not Get Arrested and that\u2019s it. No fashionistas here. But my parents are a little more appearance oriented, so I knew from the get go I\u2019d have to intervene if I didn\u2019t want him to wear his favorite grey sweatshirt and bloodied carhart lol\n\nHe\u2019s a simple country man with simple tastes.", "This is a modest approach and I don't have any reason to disagree. I still don't get why someone would feel insulted, but I do get why some parents would be shocked.\n\nI have to say though that both my husband and I would approve if our future son in law wore band t-shirts. \ud83d\ude01", ">I suspect you are typing this from your mom's basement while thinking that you are a victim of society.\n\nAh, how lovely. The good old redditor who throws ad hominem just because someone disagrees with them. I guess *that* is very respectful and considerate, huh, and you're typing it while you're riding your fancy high horse.\n\nJust FYI:\n\n1. I have already said that he could have worn something different, albeit still casual, which you have chosen to ignore. If you still think this is indicative of lack of consideration, then you have some pretty distorted ideas about what being considerate and respectful means.\n2. Many people here are voting NTA. Are we all typing from our basement, blaming society?\n3. I can't think of anything more respectful than 'live and let live' or else don't judge someone by their choice of clothing.\n4. I am a 42-year old female academic, also married to an academic. We both like our band t-shirts. We also teach our daughter, from the view of our 4th floor apartment in Greece, that they should not judge people for their appearance; also, that she should not insult people when they disagree with her.\n5. My mother, a 72-year old retired academic, never paid attention to what her SIL wore. She is the one that taught me not to judge others.\n\nCould he have worn a different t-shirt? Sure. Is he an inconsiderate asshole for not doing so? I'm frankly scared of a society that superficial.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Could you connect the dots for me? I fail to see how wearing a t-shirt is disrespectful or inconsiderate, but I'm clearly in the minority here.", "I don't understand what is so disrespectful about being casual to begin with. Some families are casual. My in laws would be weirded out if I showed up to meet them in fancier clothes I'm sure. \n\nTo me, when it comes to appearance, being respectful means being clean, brushed hair, not wearing too much perfume.", "I'd rather my parents look at my partners personality, how he treats and talks to me and them, rather than focus on a band tshirt? I'd rather him be respectful to them and personable than worry about a fucking top. \n\nHe's not going there naked, shoeless etc. Isn't his personality and how he respects their daughter more important?", "You can do that with literally any band. The \"don't wear the band x shirt to the band x show\" rule is silly", "It\u2019s an example, there are other ways to dress appropriately to an important event thats more than just \u201cI threw on whatever band shirt that was still clean\u201d.", "Not saying it's in the same ballpark. I'm saying if someone is a functioning member of society, who doesn't struggle with understanding social etiquette, you generally understand that certain situations often expect a certain type of dress. Let's not pretend otherwise. This isn't rocket science.", "Plus it's easier to dress down in the fly if you're overdressed.", "It's usually pretty cute too, like \"Oh they REALLY want to appear fresh, how flattering.\"", "Not like he's weird but like the situation is always weird lol", "Oh, you meant for the relationship? My bad, I thought you meant that he didn\u2019t leave a good impression on the parents", "Always nice to see someone take the verdict of this sub seriously.\n\nGood luck in the relationship, if you mean what you said you'll be just fine", "INFO: Were you the only one dressed so causally?", "Sorry to say but her parents are 100% shit talking you.", "You can't change what you already did, you already dressed like that and gave them certain first impression wearing a band t-shirt for their first meeting... In a dinner... At their home...", "Exactly! It\u2019s not that hard to make an effort. And it shouldn\u2019t have to be demanded of you, to show common respect for the people in your life you claim to care about.", "But skulls scary! oooOOOooo", "I like that.  You think because you made your insult generalized, that you weren't engaging in an ad hominem attack.  Very amusing.  \n\n\nAnd yes, being an academic does explain some of your attitude.  Not quite the same as being in your mom's basement, but certainly a subculture that often prides itself on eschewing societal norms in a demonstration, no matter how symbolic, of how independent you are in your thinking.", "You know how lawyers wear suits and not jeans and an offensive Cradle of Filth t-shirt? Or how you look nicer for your job interview than you do after you've been working there for six years and hate the place? It's like that.\n\nYou wear nice things as an outward expression of how you wish to make a good impression, and also to highlight that you think an event is important and thus 'worth dressing up for'.\n\nLike I see my fiancee every day, she sees me first thing in the morning, she sees me looking my worst, but if we're going out on a date I shave and look nice to signal to her 'you are important and today is important, looking good for you is important today'. It's just one of those little cultural cues. Non-verbal language.\n\nI'm a scruffy guy and I always hated wearing a suit but I still like to pull out a collared button-up for the big days out.", "Somewhat formal events require somewhat formal attire. Dressing out of the respectful attire for a given situation is disrespectful. This was a meeting that requires nicer clothing. A screen printed band t-shirt is a very long way from khakis or nice jeans and a clean, ironed button down.", "Typically one's parents are among the most important people in their lives. If your SO wants to introduce you to their parents they're saying \"Hey, I like you enough that I want you in my life for a long time, I want to demonstrate to my parents why you are worth keeping around and possibly marrying.\"\n\nWearing a T-shirt, especially one described as 'clean that day' means you don't recognize that this is a significant social event. You're telling your SO that you view the relationship as casual, when the 'meet the parents' event typically signals that you're moving past a casual relationship. You don't wear a Band T-shirt to a job interview, do you? Think of meeting her parents as an interview to join the family.\n\nEdit to add: I actually did wear a band T-shirt to meet my future Father in law, but he was a biker from Arkansas and wearing a button-up and slacks would have gone over just as poorly as OP's band t-shirt with the Indian parents. the key (as always) is communication. I asked my wife what I should wear, what the expectation was and dressed accordingly.", "I love band t-shirts myself, but I think, as others have said before, meeting parents for the first time is definitely a reason to dress up a little bit. To show them and the partner that you actually care. For people with no connection to this kind of music it might actually be sort of disrespectful. People are different", "I personally wouldn't wear a band t-shirt, especially not one with a fairly gruesome design on it, to meet a partner's parents for the first time. But I don't see the problem with wearing a clean, neat, well-fitting t-shirt.", "Would you wear a band tshirt and jeans to a job interview?", "i just feel like meeting parents for the first time has an air of slight formality that you should dress for. i don\u2019t think wearing a band t shirt around your SO\u2019s family is inherently wrong but for a first meeting wouldn\u2019t most people want to look their best to show they care about making a good impression? it takes ten minutes to button up a shirt and put on a nice fitting pair of pants, and that little effort can save you a lifetime of headache with your future in laws. i\u2019m a second generation immigrant and my partner just met my dad in november and i know if my partner wasn\u2019t cleaned up, dressed well, with a fresh haircut and a lined up beard, my dad would have been so annoying about it and that\u2019s not worth getting to wear a t shirt out.", "Put it this way.  You wear those t-shirts because they are comfortable and maybe you like the band  These are purely self centered motivations.  They are not generally seen as formal or considerate.  So, when you wear them, you are saying 'I don't care what you think or how my look appears to you, I only care about me'.  This is, definitionally, disrespectful.  \n\n\nThis is either intuitive or something you will never understand", "THIS! My in-laws are from a very rural area and do NOT dress up. Like blue jeans for weddings are cool\u2026. If I showed up wearing fancy clothing I would look like a snob. However, my husband told me very early on how his family was religious and so I would never choose clothing that had any curse words on it, which would offend them. I truly think that if the GF mentioned the fact her parents weren\u2019t as casual (as potentially the OP\u2019s family might be) it would have made this situation a non-issue.", "Must just be an American thing then, never heard of anyone dressing up to meet family. You seem to be generalizing that social etiquette is the same everywhere.", "That\u2019s a very good point.", "For sure", "I mean, either way, honestly. Worst case, he upset all 3 of them. Best case, he upset just gf. Neither option is good.\n\nFor me, it's a respect thing. Like, I'm not expecting him to wear a tux or a suit, even a full sleeve dress shirt could be a lot. He doesn't need to *not* be himself, he just needs to look like he put in the effort. Like a job interview, I don't expect the person to wear black tie, but I do expect them to look like they give a shit about getting the job. I'd expect OP to look like he gives a shit what gf's parents think of him, and like he cares enough to want it to be positive thoughts because he *cares about gf*. \n\nOnce you get to know them better, then yeah, you can dress more casually if you find out the family tends to be more casual. You still act like yourself from the get-go, so your behavior *shouldn't* take a sudden change or anything, but you can behave the same in an iron maiden shirt as you can in a polo or even just a nice, plain t-shirt. Just like with a job, you may wear a suit to the interview, but slacks and a polo is totally fine once you have the job for your day to day office look.", "I'm a computer programmer so\u2026 totally?

I also dont have to dress up at work and can wear a band t if I want, but I still wore a nice outfit to the interview.", "You do realize America isn't the only country with Indian Immigrants? just because they do it that way doesn't mean every Indian person does too. I have plenty of friends whose parents came from India, never seen or heard any of them dress any differently to meet parents.", "Yes, I do realize that. Do you? Since you\u2019re the one who decided it must be an American thing. \n\nThe parents in question are Indian immigrants, OP didn\u2019t mention what country he is in, and you have no clue whether or not the people in the comments are American.
