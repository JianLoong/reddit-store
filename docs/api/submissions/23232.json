Tipping in the US is out of control.  If YOUR standard is 15%, then pay 15%.  I personally think tipping solely base on price of the meal is very flawed.  It should a specified dollar amount per dish/drink, not a percentage.  A higher price of a meal does not necessarily equate to the waiter/waitress working harder.", "YTA - at least in the US, a 20% tip is considered the minimum standard and anything less than that is only justified if you experienced some sort of substandard service.", "I\u2019ve lived in the US my whole life, I think 15-20 is standard\u2026.. I generally tip 20 but many people I know tip 15%", "I start at 15% and depending on service you go up to 20%. Lowest would be 10%. \n\nIt\u2019s getting out of control, your employer should be taking care of you, not me, anything I give as a tip is extra and you should be grateful.", "NTA, you were tipping what you thought was standard and you apologized and corrected your tip once you found out it wasn't.\n\nThe real AH in this situation to me seems like the manager, I get that this is in the US where the tipping system is fucked up but who in their right mind thinks they have the audacity to interrogate customers for not tipping their staff enough when they're the ones employing them. Just seems like a common courtesy to not do that, regardless if you think the customer is being cheap or not.\n\nEdit - Unless the manager isn't actually in charge of their payrolls. Where I live it's standard to associate the manager with the one who's manning the paybooks, but either way it doesn't seem right to be confronted like that nonetheless. But I guess the US has different rules and etiquette when it comes to this situation.", "YTA, but only lightly.\n\nWhen I started reading etiquette books and websites regarding the USA, even more than a decade ago, it was always explained there that a tip should be 20% or more (less only for bad service). \n\nSo the manager was right about that.

In my 20s I\u2019d wrangle the bill because she couldn\u2019t understand 15 was standard. 20 is crazy considering the cost of meals and drinks these days especially on top of tax. Guess I will continue not to eat out anywhere but Chinese and pubs as I\u2019m old and not fancy enough.", "Businesses that rely on customers to tip to make up for the low wages they pay employees don\u2019t have a viable business. Raise the prices if you need to, but do not pass the buck to customers because you failed to set your business up properly. 15% is standard, 20% is generous, anything more is at discretion. \n\nDon\u2019t get me started on grocery stores wanting customers to donate to charities so they can claim the tax benefits.", "I've heard that 15% used to be the standard but now it's 20%. I'm sure that change didn't happen across America simultaneously, so maybe it happened more recently in your community\n\nTipping culture is total bullshit, but you were right not to take it out on the waitress or the manager.

We ordered more than a simple meal (appetizers, drinks, main course). The whole time, the waitress was very nice and responsive\u2014 nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nAt the end of the meal, I got the receipt. Suggested gratuity was in 18%, 20%, and 22% increments. I decided to just pay (what I thought was normal) 15%.\n\nLater that evening, the manager comes up to us with the receipt going, \u201cwas everything okay?\u201d I just said \u201ceverything was perfect,\u201d not thinking anything of it. \n\nShe then goes and says \u201cwell you tipped really low. And I feel bad for the waitress.\u201d A little taken off guard, I said \u201cI paid 15%. That\u2019s pretty standard, I think.\u201d She said, \u201cno that\u2019s low\u2026 it should be at least 20%.\u201d\n\nI apologized and increased the tip to 20% and let it go. I didn\u2019t want to make a big scene, especially around my friends.\n\nI asked my friends afterward whether or not I was right. They replied that \u201c15% is standard. That lady was a bit much\u201d and then talked about how tipping culture in the US is pretty awful.\n\nWhen thinking about it, I wish I responded, \u201cif you really felt that bad, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be paying your employee so low that she would rely solely on tips.\u201d OR maybe I should have just ripped up my receipt and said \u201cNow you should explain to ur employee how you lost all her tips from us.\u201d\n\nAITA for paying 15% for tip instead of 20%?

(Northern Illinois- Chicagoland area.) However, the manager bringing that up to you is SUPER rude.", "NTA. Tips are *extras*, you aren't required to give a certain amount. You could, technically, give no tip at all, but I think that would be an asshole move unless the whole experience was a disaster. The standard is usually 10% minimum and anything above that is for very good service. Most people think 20% is for great or excellent service, and I would agree, but I still don't think people should be made to feel bad for giving less than that. 15% is a perfectly acceptable tip.\n\nAnd before anyone jumps in about wages, that is a separate issue. If the salary for these jobs is too low to live off of, then the government should be raising the required minimum wage to a living wage. It should *not* be the customer's responsibility to financially support someone providing a service. Their salary is supposed to cover all the responsibilities of their job, and the tip is a bonus that a person gives out of kindness because they thought the service was *above* average. If you have an issue with minimum wages, take it up with the government, not with the random person buying a dinner. The fact that every place seems to ask for a tip, even when they're literally doing nothing other than the bare minimum of their job is not helping anyone. So many people are struggling financially right now. This is just robbing Peter to pay Paul.", "NAH. You tipped what you thought were normal and then increased it when it was pointed out that it was not. Regardless, I wish restaurants just included the tip in the bill as a standard charge of 20% or whatever is the norm instead of making a big show about it where the patron has to guess the socially acceptable amount of tip and get shamed if they are incorrect and also this whole charade of the customer leaving a tip and the server acting grateful. Just put it in the bill why the whole drama.", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have bulge", "20 is standard now for good service, but 15 isn't so low that it warrants a conversation or manager interference. And yes, the culture sucks but it's hard to break without hurting the individuals who rely on it. Vicious cycle.", "Sigh. 20% is standard so you insisting it\u2019s 15% which it isn\u2019t makes YTA. Debating tipping culture and the merits is really besides the point since this is how things are and under tipping a waitress because you \u201c don\u2019t like the system\u201d is just an AH move", "NTA, Anyone saying you're an asshole, are slaves of capitalism. Ask anyone outside the US lol", "ESH. Manager shouldn\u2019t have said anything. \n\nIf the suggested tip amounts were right there why didn\u2019t you choose one of them? I\u2019ve never heard anything besides 20% being standard for a tip. And in this economy I tip 25%. If I can\u2019t afford to tip I stay home or only frequent establishments that pay their staff a real wage.", "YTA\n\n\u201cif you really felt that bad, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be paying your employee so low that she would rely solely on tips.\u201d\n\nYeah, manager's don't have the ability to raise their employees salaries beyond what the owner sets the maximum at. You're trying to make a stand to someone who has no ability to change their salaries. If you really think that waiters should be paid more, and not have to rely on tips, that's something to bring up to restaurant OWNERS or congress. Not a manager who is just trying to keep everything running smoothly. \n\nIf I can't tip 20%, I make myself dinner.", "It use to be 15% before the pandemic. During the pandemic everyone felt bad for service workers having to work during those times so started to over tip and eventually caused the average tip to increase from 15 to 20%. I don\u2019t like it at all\u2026", "I agree. I would say in the US, 15% WAS standard when I was waiting tables (and I was always excited to get 20%), but the standard has crept up since then to 18-20%. That said, there\u2019s still a lot of Americans used to 15% so surely the manager would have just interpreted his original tip from that lens rather than making him worry he might have got the waitress in trouble\u2026", "Wtf are you reading.", "It is helpful to note that the standard was 15% and then 20% for excellent service. It has changed in my lifetime (and adulthood). I think around a decade ago or maybe a little longer.", "So if the cost of meals are going up so are people\u2019s bills which means they should be paid more which means tipping more.

TBH, I didn\u2019t really put up a fight. \n\nI didn\u2019t really realize what she meant when she said the tip was low, so I just explained how I thought my tip was standard.

If you\u2019re a European good for you nobody gives a fuck, glad y\u2019all have wage regulation. Over here we tip. And one person not tipping doesn\u2019t change the culture so the comments are unnecessary.", "Depending where you are it increased well before the pandemic, it has been the norm here in California for at least a decade or more even. I can\u2019t remember when it changed, but it has been 20% for a while. But I also remember it being 15%.", "No they are already getting twenty percent on the pretax amount since tips are now added by machine. They are also getting more because it\u2019s a percentage so when the cost goes up the tip goes up. What it means is the increasing number of people in the middle will not go out to these establishments that are enforcing the new minimums and will stick to restaurants that still have the default 15 on their machines (and some in my area still have 10). If they can make it with the increasingly narrower customer base good for them. If any restaurant behaved like that I would never be back nor would they want me back so it works out but then don\u2019t complain your business isn\u2019t making it. NTA OP.", "The server will be compensated with minimum wage, not $2.13 or whatever. In a lot of states, the minimum wage is higher excluding tips, for example in California it s $15.50/hr + tips \n\nAlso, manager didn\u2019t \u201cinquire\u201d about the service, the agenda was to push for more tip", "Fine I\u2019ll adjust to NAH. 15% in the US would mean seriously substandard service so the manager would be required to enquirer what went wrong.
