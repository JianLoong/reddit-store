I called them a few times and one of them finally picked up and said ''We're around El Toro, come around''.

We had a flashpass and they kept it even though I paid for it too.\n\nI told them to get out of the line and intercept with me so that we could all move as a group. 2 of them saw the message and left me on read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy this time, almost 2 hours had passed between me waiting for them/calling them and them ignoring me  pretty much.

I actually even realized that I was happier without them around and having solo fun is also cool. I just did not like having to wait in line even though I had paid for a flashpass but they kept it\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stayed there for 7 hours and none of them ever called me back again until around 6 pm, which is because I was the one who drove them there. Guess what? I didn't pick up and just left them to figure it out\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey kept calling me until 7:30, which means they waited for me and I was almost home by then anyways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am usually a chill person so I did not blow up and give them the reaction they possibly wanted to get out of using me and instead I just texted their group that I want my share of the flashpass money back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for leaving them there and asking for my little bit of money?\n\nEdit: I asked for the money back because they took the flashpass with them so I had to wait in regular lines the whole day even though I also paid for it.

They avoided you all day, you brought the karma by avoiding them at the end. They're obviously selfish and you're better without them.", "NTA, they took advantage of you and thought you would just take it. Also, I doubt you'll see any of that money back", "NTA. These people are not your friends and I hope that it cost them more than the flashpass to get home individually. Lost their contact details and find some real friends.", "NTA They ignore you, leave you by yourself for hours and then expect a ride back? No. Im glad you had some fun without them.", "Nta, i would have left them as well, but you shouldn\u2019t ask them for money back because they obviously won\u2019t give it back.  Also, I\u2019m assuming they spent quite a bit on a taxi so they\u2019re definitely not giving it back. \nBut good for you for having a backbone and leaving them.

You ALL paid for it. YOU used it. THEY chose not to, and while it sucks that they ditched you for other friends, it was to *their* financial detriment, not yours. You still used it to go on rides and have an awesome solo time.
