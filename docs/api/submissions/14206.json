Also whats the chance that maybe they were going to ditch you anyways at the park once you all got there?

And its another reason I'm not crazy about going in big groups. I'm more of a 4 or 5 and even with that, gotta be people I really like and can compromise. Bigger the group, the less you can do especially paying that much.\n\nIt's a longer drive (6flags is like 30minutes away via Monmouth road/537) but I rather go to dorney than 6flags.

They purposely didn't want you to find them. What AHs. And for them to take the flash pass with them KNOWING you could not use it. Their school friend they ran into used yours, I'm pretty sure that's why you were ditched. These are grown-ups acting like nasty bully kids.
