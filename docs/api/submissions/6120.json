You\u2019re her child, and she\u2019s the parent. She needs to be responsible enough to do these things for herself. She needs to get an alarm and to get her lazy ass up to make her own breakfast.\n\nShe should be waking *you* up and cooking for you in the morning to make sure you have a great day at school. You\u2019re still young and you might feel more appreciated and loved if your mom made the same effort that you do for her.\n\nHonestly, you need to break this habit of doing this for your mom. I don\u2019t know how long this has been a routine for you, but this isn\u2019t normal, and this is not your responsibility. You shouldn\u2019t be taking care of your mom- she should be taking care of you. I don\u2019t even make my own kids do this stuff for me, and I have teenagers too. I would never make them do this. This is not appropriate parenting, and you shouldn\u2019t be brought up to believe that it is because that\u2019s simply not true.\n\nYou\u2019ve made your point, and you were right. She should be embarrassed because she\u2019s in the wrong. I fully appreciate the effort you went through to prove a point to your mother that she\u2019s treating you like a maid, and even if she doesn\u2019t get it, you should go further to stand up for yourself and refuse to be treated this way, beginning with not allowing her to use you anymore for her own personal gain.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIf I had a kid who made breakfast for me just one day a week, I'd be over the moon.\n\nYou're not the parent here.

Stop waking your mom up and making her breakfast and speak to a guidance counselor at school about what you\u2019re being made to do if you need backup.  Too bad if she\u2019s stressed; she\u2019s an adult and made adult choices and she doesn\u2019t get to make you the adult. Where are the dads in this picture?

You talked to your mom multiple times about the situation being a problem and she did nothing but continue to be disrespectful towards you. As a parent in order to be respected you actually have to act like a parent which means not expecting your 16-year-old daughter to get up and make you breakfast in the morning, and then bitching about it when it isn\u2019t up to your standards.

What about your father, does he help around the house, with your little brother?", "YTA, \r  \nYou may have been trying to make a point, but you went about it in a disrespectful way. You embarrassed your mom in front of her family, and that's not acceptable. You could have tried talking to her or confiding in another family member instead.

You ordered an outfit (hopefully not an inappropriate one..), you researched and practiced French accents, and waited for a day when multiple people would be able to witness it.\n\nShould you be in charge of waking your mom and preparing breakfast? No, you're still her responsibility while you're underaged. But your mom also sounds like she's going through some shit and also has a one year old to look after, which is not an easy task. She's exhausted. She's on edge. It doesn't excuse her comments to you about the food and what not, but damn your calculated response to embarrass her is crazy.", "Info: When you describe your brother as (1M) do you mean he is 1 month old?", "YTA.

I've expressed how I feel like she's taking out her stress on me and that it's not fair. It always ends in some rendition of \"you're being dramatic,\" though, and nothing ever changes.

Stopped making breakfast. No where does it seem that the mother is forcing her to make breakfast and wake her up.

When I say 1M, I mean one year old.", "Just because this is how it is in your house, don't assume everyone is like you.

And in this particular case, if we talk duties, then it is definitely the mom's duty to make her daughter's food, not the other way round.", "I didn\u2019t mean she should be making her teenager breakfast every single morning. Sometimes parents do this out of love to set their kids up in the morning to ensure they eat a good breakfast and to have a great day, and it doesn\u2019t have to be an every day thing. Sometimes it\u2019s a spontaneous effort to make your kids feel special before they leave for school or because they just woke up and breakfast is already cooked, and teenagers also do the same at times to show that they love their parents and want to cook them breakfast.\n\nThe difference is that this mother is *expecting* this every morning. The daughter should be allowed to make herself breakfast every morning if she wants to, but it shouldn\u2019t be an expectation from her mother.\n\nThis mom isn\u2019t teaching responsibility. She\u2019s just teaching this kid how to be an entitled asshole and a bad parent someday.", "Then NTA she just wasn\u2019t listening to you.  Instead of being grateful for your help she was rude.  If she\u2019s stressed there are other ways to channel it that don\u2019t involve emotionally abusing her teenage daughter.", "So she's a narcissist. I'm getting some real Mother Gothel vibes here, and it's unsettling. \n\nIt might be time to stop the morning routine, you're enabling bad behavior. Maybe find an activity that takes you out of the house before she wakes up. She can't blame you for being dramatic if you've just made other commitments, and it'll force her to deal with her own shit attitude in the morning. \n\nNTA btw", "Well, it sounds like you\u2019re definitely doing your share to help around the house. I might have done the maid bit when family wasn\u2019t around, though.", "Ok- then NTA.", "So not everyone is raising their teenagers to be independent? Worrying....", "Not at all. Just that parents take care of their kids as long as they're under their roof. Just because they make their food, that doesn't mean they can't also teach them to be independent. The two aren't mutually exclusive."]}
