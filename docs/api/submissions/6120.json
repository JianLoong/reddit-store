I understand the pressure of a newborn but you\u2019re not her alarm clock and if you\u2019re getting ready for school you need to do that. For you to make breakfast and get put it down when you work hard on it is just rude. I\u2019m proud of you for making your point. The fact you perfected an accent just for that, *chefs kiss*", "NTA respect is mutual. If she expects it from you, she needs to give it to you. Also, who complains when their kid makes them breakfast!?! She\u2019s kind of ungrateful.", "NTA\n\nMaybe not the best way to handle it (although certainly a hilarious one) but you are 16, so that\u2019s comprehendible. In the end, your mother needs therapy, I don\u2019t know what happened in her life to make her treat her daughter like this and getting so stressed out, but she needs to work on that, professionally.", "OP you are NTA.  You are, however, hardworking and absolutely brilliant! I'm ready to be president of your fan club!", "NTA", "This is real.", ">She said that she was the parent...\n\nPerhaps she could also make an attempt to act like one. NTA.", "If she is the parent, then she needs to start acting like it...for BOTH of her children. NTA.", "NTA\nThat\u2019s honestly hilarious", "NTA; remind her who's going to be deciding on the quality of her retirement home someday.", "OP as someone who went through something similar, it\u2019s not your fault don\u2019t go blaming yourself. One day she\u2019s gonna be wondering why you don\u2019t come around and she\u2019ll wake up to see that it\u2019s her fault for treating you like a servant rather than daughter", "NTA. I would stop the breakfast and waking up too... Not your job not your issue. If she only has complaints about what you're doing then give her something to actually complain about. \nMaybe when \"I'm angry because my child doesn't serve me breakfast in bed daily\" comes out of her mouth she'll realize how entitled and batshit she sounds...\n\nPS: I love the flair you added to make a point! So funny so good! Hit em where it hurts!", "NTA! I feel so sorry for you! Why are YOU BEING THE MOM? She needs to learn how to do this stuff since surely in two years you are outta there! I would be!", "NTA \u2014 your mom is so out of line that the line is invisible at the point. I don\u2019t care that she\u2019s stressed about Xmas. People choose to do that and make a huge deal out of Xmas even though it obviously affects their mental health. You\u2019re a sweetheart. Turn 18 and get as far as you can from her. I did that with my abusive mom and I\u2019ve never looked back", "Naw f that. Tell her if she wants the respect a parent deserves then she needs to do the job and stop forcing her kid to do it. Stop taking on her responsibilities.", "NTA. Arrange to leave soon this abusive woman", "NTA.", "NTA\nYour mother is using and abusing you.\nShe is unhappy and dissatisfied and she is letting you take the flak for all of it, in spite of you being her maid.", "NTA but ILMAO how you prepare the maid thing.", "NTA\n\nShe can't treat you like a maid and then get mad that you dress and act like one", "NTA.\n\nIf you were my daughter I would have laughed and gone along with it for a bit and then apologized for having been so grumpy lately.\n\nI have teens and sometimes they do funny things to make a point and I just have to roll with it. :)", "NTA. I think it's messed up that she expects you to do those things for her in the morning. The snarky comments just make it worse; and they're something that can chip away at you. A parent should never take our their stress on their own kid, that is not okay.", "NTA but a simpler solution would be to stop making her breakfast. Tell her you\u2019ve stopped because you\u2019re sooooo bad at it. \n\nSorry your mom is so mean to you. Let her starve.", "NTA and well played.", "NTA.  You really should have addressed the problem when it occurred.  \u201cThis takes like\u2026\u201d.  \u201cWell then, you can go back to being the parent in the morning, fix your own breakfast, and take care of YOUR one year-old.\u201d", "Yta. You know you\u2019re wrong or you wouldn\u2019t have posted.    Don\u2019t try to embarrass people in front of company. It will always backfire on you.   You could\u2019ve done the same thing on a different day.   She probably is taking advantage of you. You\u2019ve got two years left assuming you live in America hang in there you sound like an amazing daughter to me.   Things will get better.!!!!", "YTA for intentionally embarrassing your mom and you mom\u2019s TA for parentifying you.  Just inform her calmly but firmly that you\u2019re not making her breakfast anymore.  You\u2019re hilarious. \ud83d\ude03", "YTA but I'm okay with it. Please continue.", ">You didn\u2019t ask her to give birth to you, she did that.\n\nAww come on, that was ONE TIME!!!\n- Source, OPs mum... probably", "Seems like OP is the parent in this situation. A grown ass adult acting like a pissy tween and expecting her teenage daughter to be her parent. What a weird situation. \n\nOP stop making her breakfast and waking her up. She's an adult. She's the parent, not you. She needs to act like it. What a sorry excuse for a mother.", "Yea, when I was a teenager, my brother and I would make my parents breakfast on special occasions (birthdays, mother\u2019s days, fathers days, and some random weekends when we felt like being nice). And my parents were always thrilled and grateful. \n\nI\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve been really happy if we\u2019d done that every day, but I usually left ages before anyone got up so it couldn\u2019t have happened.\n\nThe mom\u2019s reaction isn\u2019t cool and OP deserves some gratitude and appreciation for the work he\u2019s been doing.", "I couldn't agree more. This is not a good sign for OP. If there's any way OP can start preparing to get away from her narc mom sooner than later, I really recommend it.", "Ha ha ha ha!", "An emotionally immature woman like this isn\u2019t going to pay any attention unless she\u2019s embarrassed in front of others. This was an excellent tactic on OP\u2019s part. She likely didn\u2019t WANT to embarrass her mother but OP has already tried speaking with her without success. \n\nThis mother is emotionally and verbally abusive and is forcing her daughter into a parentified role. Do you really think that if her daughter had done this in private she wouldn\u2019t have been berated, yelled at and dismissed? \n\nEmbarrassment is the least this woman deserves.", "OP said she spoke to her mother already about it but she wasn\u2019t listening.", "Eww. Did you see the age here? You expect a 16 year old not to act like a 16 year old? Also, \"future sweetie\" - objectify women much?", "You had me up until the last paragraph. Because you didn't read the text, and most likely didn't have parents that treated you that poorly. Anyone who thinks their child owes them dependent services like being an alarm clock or a personal cook is at least a little narcissistic, talking to them won't do squat, you have to bite back or your point won't get across.", "Can you stop making her breakfast and waking her up since she clearly doesn\u2019t appreciate it? Or will she treat you worse? (I can\u2019t believe I have to ask if someone\u2019s mom will treat them worse if they don\u2019t do something they shouldn\u2019t be doing in the first place. That\u2019s so unacceptable on your moms part)", "Do you have any other family nearby that you can stay with for a time? Maybe it will help the two of you to have some space and to help her realize how much you really do to help her out. If not now do to the school year, maybe during the summer?", "Is it the shit hawks?", "I think that if a conversation won\u2019t work, a public humiliation is guaranteed to be a flaming shit show. That\u2019s not how you make a point, that\u2019s how you get revenge.", "Super gross comment, agreed. Commenter willing to admit there\u2019s abuse going on but having issues with how the 16 year old goes about trying to cope with it and get some of her own needs met in an abusive family environment? \n\nAnd then suggesting the maids outfit be used in a sexual way to a 16 year old who is in an abusive situation and likely will have issues determining what a healthy partner is in the first place due to forced codependency as a teen\u2026", "Ok, point well taken about the maid\u2019s outfit, I apologize and will remove it.  I still think she got her point across in a hilarious way.", "Take it from someone who literally grew up with a clinical narcissist\u2026. that\u2019s the reason I wrote what I did.", "Then by that metric, making breakfast could be a very reasonable chore for a teen.\n\nIts the moms crummy attitude thats the issue.", "Exactly, and count down the days until you're able to GTFO! And to piggy back on this comment, def get into activities so that she can't use you as a free babysitter either.", "Have you been in a parentified abusive situation as a teen? I have. \n\nAnd I can tell you that drawing attention to the situation public through some minor embarrassment is probably the best thing OP could have done to protect herself.", "Why are you so mad and judgmental?", "How are getting mad and judgemental when I am asking a question?", "Man, your username really checks out", "Nah, your tone and choice of words went a long way, stop digging", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
