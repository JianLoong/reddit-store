He should be ashamed... and if he can't realize that and apologize fully and properly (including never doing anything like that again), you should consider leaving him.", "NTA - tell him you\u2019ll tell if they compare testicle diameter", "NTA that's gross as fuck and saying \"my GF's boobs are bigger than yours\" isn't self-deprecating in any sense, it's misogynistic and childish. Self-deprecating humor puts down the person speaking and can often be a sign (among other things) of major self-esteem issues (I say this as someone who used to and still sometimes but less so made self-deprecating jokes).", "NTA but your boyfriend and his brother are. What are they, like 14?", "Reverse it and ask them who has the bigger dick size, I highly doubt they've ever compared and watch them shrivel up and avoid it.....then say your supposed to support eachother.", "NTA, that's not support, just exploitation", "INFO: How old is he, 12? Tell him they both need to grow up. Are they going to compare penis sizes next?", "Info:  how old is everyone?  If older than 18, these people are all awful and I\u2019d stay far away permanently. If you are young (which I assume from this childish-ness) your boyfriend has a lot to learn about respect. He owes you an apology. NTA.", "NTA. Your BF is right, couples support each other. His pissing contest with his brother is not more important than your privacy or comfort. You said you didn't feel comfortable sharing that information, and he should've backed you up.\n\nThat's not even mentioning the fact that he and his brother are brazenly using parts of yours and this other woman's body as some kind of weird bragging rights. I wouldn't be okay with that, and if your aren't, you should let your boyfriend know.", "NTA \n\nYour boyfriend is. The competitive thing is normal, but comparing bra size is the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. And a real red flag is him lecturing you for not saying it.", "NTA. Funny how a conversation about bras reveals how unclear he is about support.", "NTA\n\nThis weird objectification just makes me feel uncomfortable tbh. You're well within your rights to shut it down but withholding the information and not playing they're silly games. Both your BF and his brother need to grow up tbh", "NTA, you should have asked why he wasn't supporting you when his brother was being extremely inappropriate", "NTA, but you should really consider buying your BF a good bra so he gets the support he needs.  \n\nPersonally I find crude joking around like your BF and his brother was doing to be funny, but if everyone isn't laughing then it isn't funny.

Maybe it\u2019s just me but WTF are wrong with them for comparing something like that. What prize do they get? That\u2019s something private and shouldn\u2019t be shared around especially without your consent.", "Your BF and his brother are a bunch of idiot morons, who waste their time on this non-sense bragging and comparing their partners like they're pieces of meat. You're smart not to share your bra size with these immature assholes. And as for your BF lecturing you about supporting each other, pfft, tell him to look in the mirror. I mean seriously, what kind of support is comparing your partner's body parts? That's just dumb...", "NTA. That entire conversation was gross, and you were right to not enable it.

How old are these boys? Why is life a competition to them?

Your boyfriend and his brother are sexist jerks. I would never in a million years compare my partner\u2019s breasts to another person\u2019s, but especially not as a competition. \n\nYour boyfriend sounds like a loser. The fact that he thought he had any right to lecture you after that is absurd. Might want to just throw the whole boyfriend away.", "NTA.  Tell him that you get more support from your bra than from him and BTW, he won't be seeing your bra anytime soon.", "NTA. Next time they should cut to the chase and measure their penises.", "NTA but you sound very young. Time to place a boundary. They can play their competition game but don\u2019t get to use you as part of it, especially when it comes to your body.\n\nIf he refuses, then he might be too young to be in a relationship.", "Nta", "NTA, he should have whipped his dick out and said mine is bigger.", "NTA and he would no longer be my boyfriend.  He isn't old enough to handle a relationship.   If he is so thick, he can't see how crude and vulgar that was ... ditch him.", "NTA.  we're supposed to support and encourage the good parts of our partners, not this nonsense.  he's not owed blind support; you're perfectly allowed to rescind your backing when he's doing something that's uncomfortable to you.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't give ages, but uh, is your boyfriend 14??\n\nBoys are immature, but if you guys are adults, then yikes. I'd find a new boyfriend.", "Whip out your erect penis boys, let's go. Urgh. NTA. Gross.", "Tell them to just pull their dicks out, measure, and then stfu.", "Definitely NTA! I personally wouldn't take kindly to a joke about private matters of that sort (the my girlfriend's boobs are bigger than your's comment). But if you and your boyfriend's brother's girlfriend weren't upset by it, that's ultimately what matters. Your boyfriend is definitely TA here! He was getting mad at you for having boundaries for yourself, which is not ok. If you set boundaries, then a good partner will accept them without throwing a fit. Let alone lecturing you over it! I personally get the feeling that you're supportive of him. Yet he doesn't support you in having boundaries so that you feel comfortable. He's happy to let you be uncomfortable if it means that he gets to win some lame argument with his brother, which is definitely not ok or healthy! Not respecting boundaries is a big red flag, and you shouldn't ignore it. If he doesn't accept that you're uncomfortable telling people the size of your chest, then what else will he ignore you being uncomfortable with in the future. It starts with small things, but it gets bigger. So it will probably only get worse down the line about what he's lecturing you on when you have every right to set boundaries. I would dump him if I were in that situation because that's just toxic behavior and you deserve better!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
