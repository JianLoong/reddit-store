After school I moved back home where I struggled to find job opportunities in a small town. Her and her fiance picked a date for their wedding and she asked me to be the maid of honor. We began planning the wedding. I decided that the best thing to do was to move to a bigger city (3hrs away) where I would have more job opportunities. I told my BFF I would be leaving but would still perform my MOH duties, even making trips back home so I could be there for her. She said she understood why I had to leave.\n\nAfter the move I noticed she wouldn't answer my calls or text. I asked to be reminded when she wanted to go dress shopping so I could plan to be there. I asked her a few times if she was upset with me about anything and she said no. One day she told me she was adding two more MOH. I told her that its her wedding, I didn't mind. Weeks later I get a call from BFF saying she needed my dress size and money for a deposit on the bridesmaids dress she and the other MOHs picked out! I didn't have the money on such little notice. She said it was fine but I could tell she wasn't happy. I asked why she didn't mention they were dress shopping and she said she didn't want to bother me. I found out her and the other girls excluded me from her plans to shop for bridal gowns. I didn't want to be one of those bridesmaids that makes things about themselves so I let it go.\n\nAfter this we didnt talk much. She rarely took my calls. I planned a surprise bachelorette trip. I found fairly priced plane tickets and a hotel for the bridal party. Made a budget that would allow me to pay for the brides travel expenses and my own. I tried to surprise her about the trip she shut the idea down saying she didn't want a bachelorette party. She later mentioned that she was going on a cruise. I know her and fiance love to go on cruises so I didn't think anything of it. The NEXT day I'm scrolling on FB and see she posted about being excited for the cruise shes taking with her MAIDS OF HONOR! I called her and she brushed it off saying it wasn't a bachelorette party and that I could get a ticket on the same cruise I wanted too! I asked her why she hadn't told me anything about it she didn't really have a good reason.\n\nFound out once I moved she began hanging out with these girls more often, and became resentful that I left. They talked crap about me in my absence. She texted me soon after this and asked if I was going to pay for the dress or not. While I was able to get the money together for the dress deposit, I'd have to work extra OT to finish paying it off. I was sick of intentionally being excluded and getting heat for trying to make a better life for myself. I ended up telling her I couldn't afford the dress and wouldn't be able to be in wedding party. We've hardly spoken since.

It really hurts to find out that someone we care about just doesn\u2019t care that much back and there\u2019s really nothing you can do about it. Her excluding you from everything including a cruise and then having the audacity to ask for dress money? I\u2019d tell her where she can stick her wedding right quick and block her on everything.", "She\u2019s not your BFF, she\u2019s your NFF\u2014nearest friend (for now). You moved too far away for her to not have to plan around travel times, making you an inconvenient friend.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you weren\u2019t exactly lying about not having money, since you\u2019d have to work a lot of OT to pay for it. People drift apart, it\u2019s just a fact of life. She should have been more upfront about needing a MOH closer to home and for sure she\u2019s an A H for talking trash about you behind your back. Move on with your life, you now know what kind of person she is when push comes to shove.", "NTA - she doesn't seem interested in including you, you don't seem interested in putting up with her. \n\nOne bit of unsolicited advice though - if you don't want to do something, try not to claim it's because of money (unless that is actually the only thing that keeps you from doing it). While you're trying to be nice and spare feelings, someone might surprise you by paying for it (or worse, buying it \"for you\" and expecting you to pay it back). It can end up much worse than if you just say (nicely) that you're not going to be interested.", "NTA\n\nShe obviously didn't have the guts to say to your face that she no longer wanted you to be a bridesmaid at her wedding, so she took the mean girl route and made you out to be the bad guy. I would've pulled out of her wedding, too.\n\nAlso, she's very clearly not your friend anymore, much less a BFF. A true friend wouldn't treat you like this.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she resents that you're living and thinking independently of her - how dare you move to another town for better opportunities!\n\nThis gal sounds like a Queen Bee controlling personality and now its hatching out and showing its true colors -- and claws. \n\nThose other girlfriends of hers who are trash talking you seem like her flying monkeys.", "NTA. She should have asked how much you coukd afford to spend, selected styles in the price range everyone can afford and given you notice to get the dress (expecting a bridesmaid to buy a dress more than 4-6 months from the wedding is very inconsiderate) and she excluded you from activities.\n\nLet this friend go. She thinks bridesmaid means bride\u2019s MAID\n\nPS - the duties are to get the dress and show up sober for the wedding. Anything else is your choice and your gift to her. Wedding planning is her job and her groom\u2019s", "NTA. She's punishing you for moving to have a better life.  You reached out to her multiple times and she couldn't be bothered to tell you about the important things. Don't feel guilty, just decide on whether you want to accept her apology or not if she ever gets her head out of the sand.", "NTA.", ">I called her and she brushed it off saying it wasn't a bachelorette party and that I could get a ticket on the same cruise I wanted too!\n\nOk, this REALLY bothers me.

She clearly was upset and acting insecure cutting you out.", "NTA Tell her you'll come to the wedding if she wants but you're not going to be one of the bridesmaids, because you simply can't afford the dresses.", "NTA,  but there's nothing to lose by not being totally honest.   This friendship didn't survive the distance.   Let her know the real reason for dropping out, even if it's just showing her this reddit post.", "NTA \n\nShe purposely pushed you out. She isn't your friend.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't lying about not having enough money for the bridesmaid dress.   People move on from friendships, seem you two have.   Move on with your life, she was being cruel excluding you.", "NTA. But please understand this: you are not her best friend.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nFor whatever reason, she was clearly excluding you and being passive aggressive af about it. There's zero excuse for excluding you from the cruise and posting about going with the MOH while knowing you weren't there is likely deliberate, or at best means she forgot about you. Neither option is great. \n\nDon't play games. Remove yourself from the situation. She's going to blow up the friendship over whatever issues she has without talking to you, so it's best to step away because she clearly has zero issues making you uncomfortable, and the wedding is very unlikely to be different. Honestly, there's a decent chance it'll be worse because she knows you can't publicly say anything during it without causing drama.\n\nFocus on making friends in your new city and taking care of yourself.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't drop out, you were excluded.", "I had 2 girl best friends from school. Both became resentful towards me when I moved to a big city for higher studies. One got married and excluded me from everything when I was studying engineering. I was invited few days before her wedding and it was on my exam date So I said I can\u2019t not attend her wedding. She was kind of relieved but cut the contract with me. Another time I already landed on a high paying job in big company, my other best friend excluded me from her wedding all together. She stopped taking call few months before the marriage. I came to know from other friends that she didn\u2019t invite me because I was the talk of the town and she didn\u2019t want others to congratulate me for my job and achievement on her wedding. I cut the contract and moved to Canada for couple of years for job. After returning I threw a huge party for my own wedding and did not invite both of them. They saw the photo in Facebook and congratulated me. They are no longer my best friends but only fb friends!", "NTA but why lie? You've got clear issues with how you've been treated. Either address those issues with her, or drop her as a friend. Your choice, but putting it all on not being able to afford the dress doesn't solve your issue(s).", "NTA - She's shown you what she thinks about you and you responded appropriately.", "NTA - As it didn't seem that she really wanted you there either since she was excluding you from literally all of the activities. I know it sucks to lose a life long friendship but really she wasn't a very good friend if she started talking about you behind your back just because you moved so your could find yourself a good job. And you continually still tried to come home and take time to help her / plan with her so it's not even the fact that you got to busy and started ignoring \"your duties\". She really had no other reason to act this way other than you moved and didn't live in close proximity anymore.", "NTA.\n\nShe is no longer your friend - she is resentful you left and has discarded you for new friends and is essentially 'punishing' you for moving.\n\nI bet the second you stop contacting her, the next time you will hear from her is when she needs/wants something, the day of the wedding or really, never again.\n\nBecause she was too immature to talk to you and say that she no longer wanted you in this role or to talk through her feelings about you moving.", "Eh screw her. You don't need her. Just tell her she's awful and cut her off. NTA", "Your only mistake was not dropping this so-called friend on top of dropping out of the wedding.\n\nNTA", "What\u2019s crazy is that when I previously moved away for school we were still close. But with you putting it like that, I was always the one picking her up and driving her places when we first started planning the wedding.", "You\u2019re right I should\u2019ve told the truth. The only reason why I didn\u2019t was because as angry and hurt as I was, she\u2019s still my friend. I didn\u2019t want to take away from her moment and add unnecessary drama before the wedding. With her acting like this I felt it would\u2019ve been better to have a conversation with her after the wedding.", "Honestly, I'd disagree a bit because it kinda feels like she's looking for drama. I'd just keep things as short as possible with as little info as possible.", ">she\u2019s still my friend\n\nWhy? The way she's treated you is absolutely abysmal and certainly not conducive to friendship.", "I'd go easy on OP here. Friend breakups are hard, and it's less socially acceptable to grieve/have issues vs a romantic breakup. In short, there's just less outside support for most people through it. OP isn't ready for a blow up, though it feels like it's heading that way. If OP needs time and a softer fade to process, it's best not to push."]}
