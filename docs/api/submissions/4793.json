After school I moved back home where I struggled to find job opportunities in a small town. Her and her fiance picked a date for their wedding and she asked me to be the maid of honor. We began planning the wedding. I decided that the best thing to do was to move to a bigger city (3hrs away) where I would have more job opportunities. I told my BFF I would be leaving but would still perform my MOH duties, even making trips back home so I could be there for her. She said she understood why I had to leave.\n\nAfter the move I noticed she wouldn't answer my calls or text. I asked to be reminded when she wanted to go dress shopping so I could plan to be there. I asked her a few times if she was upset with me about anything and she said no. One day she told me she was adding two more MOH. I told her that its her wedding, I didn't mind. Weeks later I get a call from BFF saying she needed my dress size and money for a deposit on the bridesmaids dress she and the other MOHs picked out! I didn't have the money on such little notice. She said it was fine but I could tell she wasn't happy. I asked why she didn't mention they were dress shopping and she said she didn't want to bother me. I found out her and the other girls excluded me from her plans to shop for bridal gowns. I didn't want to be one of those bridesmaids that makes things about themselves so I let it go.\n\nAfter this we didnt talk much. She rarely took my calls. I planned a surprise bachelorette trip. I found fairly priced plane tickets and a hotel for the bridal party. Made a budget that would allow me to pay for the brides travel expenses and my own. I tried to surprise her about the trip she shut the idea down saying she didn't want a bachelorette party. She later mentioned that she was going on a cruise. I know her and fiance love to go on cruises so I didn't think anything of it. The NEXT day I'm scrolling on FB and see she posted about being excited for the cruise shes taking with her MAIDS OF HONOR! I called her and she brushed it off saying it wasn't a bachelorette party and that I could get a ticket on the same cruise I wanted too! I asked her why she hadn't told me anything about it she didn't really have a good reason.\n\nFound out once I moved she began hanging out with these girls more often, and became resentful that I left. They talked crap about me in my absence. She texted me soon after this and asked if I was going to pay for the dress or not. While I was able to get the money together for the dress deposit, I'd have to work extra OT to finish paying it off. I was sick of intentionally being excluded and getting heat for trying to make a better life for myself. I ended up telling her I couldn't afford the dress and wouldn't be able to be in wedding party. We've hardly spoken since.

People drift apart, it\u2019s just a fact of life. She should have been more upfront about needing a MOH closer to home and for sure she\u2019s an A H for talking trash about you behind your back.

While you're trying to be nice and spare feelings, someone might surprise you by paying for it (or worse, buying it \"for you\" and expecting you to pay it back).

She should have asked how much you coukd afford to spend, selected styles in the price range everyone can afford and given you notice to get the dress (expecting a bridesmaid to buy a dress more than 4-6 months from the wedding is very inconsiderate) and she excluded you from activities.\n\nLet this friend go.

She isn't your friend.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't lying about not having enough money for the bridesmaid dress.   People move on from friendships, seem you two have.   Move on with your life, she was being cruel excluding you.", "NTA. But please understand this: you are not her best friend.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nFor whatever reason, she was clearly excluding you and being passive aggressive af about it. There's zero excuse for excluding you from the cruise and posting about going with the MOH while knowing you weren't there is likely deliberate, or at best means she forgot about you. Neither option is great. \n\nDon't play games. Remove yourself from the situation. She's going to blow up the friendship over whatever issues she has without talking to you, so it's best to step away because she clearly has zero issues making you uncomfortable, and the wedding is very unlikely to be different. Honestly, there's a decent chance it'll be worse because she knows you can't publicly say anything during it without causing drama.\n\nFocus on making friends in your new city and taking care of yourself.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't drop out, you were excluded.", "I had 2 girl best friends from school. Both became resentful towards me when I moved to a big city for higher studies. One got married and excluded me from everything when I was studying engineering. I was invited few days before her wedding and it was on my exam date So I said I can\u2019t not attend her wedding. She was kind of relieved but cut the contract with me. Another time I already landed on a high paying job in big company, my other best friend excluded me from her wedding all together. She stopped taking call few months before the marriage. I came to know from other friends that she didn\u2019t invite me because I was the talk of the town and she didn\u2019t want others to congratulate me for my job and achievement on her wedding. I cut the contract and moved to Canada for couple of years for job. After returning I threw a huge party for my own wedding and did not invite both of them. They saw the photo in Facebook and congratulated me. They are no longer my best friends but only fb friends!", "NTA but why lie? You've got clear issues with how you've been treated. Either address those issues with her, or drop her as a friend. Your choice, but putting it all on not being able to afford the dress doesn't solve your issue(s).", "NTA - She's shown you what she thinks about you and you responded appropriately.", "NTA - As it didn't seem that she really wanted you there either since she was excluding you from literally all of the activities. I know it sucks to lose a life long friendship but really she wasn't a very good friend if she started talking about you behind your back just because you moved so your could find yourself a good job. And you continually still tried to come home and take time to help her / plan with her so it's not even the fact that you got to busy and started ignoring \"your duties\". She really had no other reason to act this way other than you moved and didn't live in close proximity anymore.", "NTA.\n\nShe is no longer your friend - she is resentful you left and has discarded you for new friends and is essentially 'punishing' you for moving.\n\nI bet the second you stop contacting her, the next time you will hear from her is when she needs/wants something, the day of the wedding or really, never again.\n\nBecause she was too immature to talk to you and say that she no longer wanted you in this role or to talk through her feelings about you moving.", "Eh screw her. You don't need her. Just tell her she's awful and cut her off.

The only reason why I didn\u2019t was because as angry and hurt as I was, she\u2019s still my friend. I didn\u2019t want to take away from her moment and add unnecessary drama before the wedding. With her acting like this I felt it would\u2019ve been better to have a conversation with her after the wedding.", "Honestly, I'd disagree a bit because it kinda feels like she's looking for drama. I'd just keep things as short as possible with as little info as possible.", ">she\u2019s still my friend\n\nWhy? The way she's treated you is absolutely abysmal and certainly not conducive to friendship.", "I'd go easy on OP here. Friend breakups are hard, and it's less socially acceptable to grieve/have issues vs a romantic breakup. In short, there's just less outside support for most people through it. OP isn't ready for a blow up, though it feels like it's heading that way.

You could \"earn\" the money, but why work overtime for that?  \n\nBut this friendship may have reached is expiration/best use by date.\n\nPS: I hope you didn't lose money on that bach party you planned.", "NTA. And you didn't drop out, you were silently push out. She hasn't been a very good friend to you.", "NTA. Why if she was so ambivalent to your existence in her life did she want you as a MOH. It's almost like she wanted to make sure to leave you out of things to punish you for leaving. Time to be done with that high school mean girl crap.", "NTA, your bff does not sound like a bff at all. I get that she is planning HER wedding and everything is about her, but there is no need to be cruel towards you. If she resents your move, she could have just said so, no need to create all this drama.", "Honestly, I would be tempted to say something to her but since she's blowing you off and making it clear she doesn't think you're worth anything to her, I would just drop her butt and not contact her again.

You busted your butt to get the money, I think you should spend on yourself and not her wedding.", "Read NFF as Not Friends Forever...", "> I didn\u2019t want to take away from her moment and add unnecessary drama before the wedding.\n\nShe already did by adding 2 MOH's (really, she called them MOH's rather than bridesmaids?) and then going on a trip with them after shooting you down when you offered one.

Focus on YOU and let the stress go.", "This has already been posted. I have read this exact story before. Why are you reposting this with ANOTHER profile?", "NTA.  I would have outright told her the truth. That you decided not to participate because they already decided that for you. They/ she are not your friends. They are catty and disgusting. You deserve better. Much better. Good on you for bettering yourself. They are jealous of you. So be it.", "NTA. That\u2019s not a friend, that\u2019s someone who\u2019s jealous you got out of the small town and she\u2019s likely gonna be stuck there for life.", "No, you are not. And technically you\u2019re not lying because you can\u2019t afford it out of your regular pay. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you but feel zero guilt about dropping out. She basically forced you to. NTA", "NTA - she's already cut you out of everything else, might as well skip the wedding too.  She is not a good friend at all.", "NTA, I'd absolutely drop out of the wedding. She doesn't care about your friendship, let her other MOH's handle everything.. I wouldn't have even lied, I'd tell her due to her shitty behavior I wouldn't be interested in throwing away anymore of my time or money on her wedding, good luck and good riddance", "NTA. She was excluding you", "NTA \n\nGet new friends!", "You're too good for her.", "NTA but also it\u2019s time to just walk away from the friendship. Send a text, \u201cit\u2019s clear that something has happened between us where our friendship no longer feels very friendly. I want you to have the wedding of your dreams and that seems like it no longer involves me. I wish you best, I\u2019m sorry our friendship is ending this way, but I think both of us will be better off if we just go our separate ways.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t drag out the drama. It really isn\u2019t worth it.

She obviously doesn't want to be friends with you anymore but is too afraid of confrontation to break things off properly. She's pulling the classic move that fuckboys pull when they don't want to be with their girlfriends anymore - hang you on by a thread until you get fed up and break it off. That way, YOU'RE to blame, not them, for the relationship ending.", "NTA, don\u2019t waste your money and time on people like that", "NTA.  She actually dropped you out of her wedding party when you moved out of town but didn't have the courtesy to put that into words.  Let it go.", "She's not your friend (anymore).
