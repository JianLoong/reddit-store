There\u2019s certainly more demands behind this one.", "NTA...Your day, your way.  It seems that you saw this sort of situation on the horizon and planned for it by not taking money from your mother. What she did at her own wedding  is not important to how you plan yours.  Stand firm and feel no guilt.", "Absolutely NTA, OP. You\u2019re completely reasonable and should stick to your boundaries.

Good for you for not taking the money from her and sticking to your decision. If she wants to invite people you don\u2019t know she is welcome to have her own party. I would just say something like \u201cwe can only have a certain amount of people as guest and we have already reached capacity. The only way this relative of yours is coming is if you give up your invitation so they can\u2019t be here in their place. Which I would accept. Other than that drop it. Because if you keep trying to create drama I will take away your invitation. My wedding is suppose to be about me and so and that\u2019s it. Quit being selfish and trying to make it about you.

But be keep a tight hold on those invitations.  I'm betting your mom is going to invite a few people anyway.  My parents invited folks to my reception without my permission despite hubs and I paying for everything for ourselves.  I just moved on and ignored those people because I didn't want to let it ruin my wedding day, but yeah definitely hurt my trust with my family. Amazing how someone can allow appearances with distant family friends to trump a relationship with your own child.", "I don't even need to read this to know you're NTA.

It's not even a question.", "NTA- you're paying for this event yourself and you don't want extra guests.\n\nIt sounds like you believe it won't stop with just one person.

I'd have said let your mom invite one person, but from your post, it looks like your mom has some issues respecting your boundaries in the past, so good play to keep everything to what you're comfortable with and refusing to let her get leverage over you.", "NTA. -  It\u2019s your day, your way.  \n\nTell mom that things are changing, Covid and all that.

I get the feeling your mum has probably told this person all about it and is now having to backtrack. Hold firm. She can arrange a vow renewal for herself if she wants control of the guestlist.", "NTA. It's your wedding and it sounds like you're paying for most of it.

This is your wedding, not hers; you do you.", "Are you going to know everyone's plus one. Is this a hill to die on, sounds like she is wanting to invite one couple, person, whatever. What is it going to hurt to allow this extended family. Now inviting a few people or more is excessive.

They lived in a small Midwest town where they knew everyone and were related to half the county. People from the local farmers to the church ladies pitched in on food. Big Polish shindig. People loved that wedding. When we married in \u201889, it was a much smaller affair far away from our original hometown, and I was frustrated when random distant relatives showed up. They happened to be in town visiting and my parents brought them along. Oh well. They were so proud to show off their daughter and new son. And tbh, those people really ponied up the dough.

Mom is having a hard time with this boundary and accepting your no answer that has been given more than once.

My husband and I had a very intimate wedding - we invited less than 80 people, and because we planned it for a Tuesday morning only about 40 came, which is exactly what we were expecting and hoping for. About a year after the wedding, my grandfather\u2019s brother and SIL came to visit to support my grandfather through some health issues. I don\u2019t have a relationship with these people - they live out of state and rarely if ever visited, and when they did they were far more interested in my brothers and male cousins than me. My great aunt asked me how I was, and I mentioned I had gotten married the year before. Her answer was a very snotty \u201cYes, I noticed we didn\u2019t get an invitation.\u201d I think she expected an apology? What she got instead was a raised eyebrow and \u201cNancy, this is literally the only conversation I can ever recall having with you in my two and a half decades of life. Why on earth would I have invited two complete strangers to the most important event of my life?\u201d She was incredibly offended, but frankly I didn\u2019t care - I don\u2019t tolerate people who feel entitled to my life.\n\nYou have no reason to invite people you don\u2019t know to your wedding. Your mom needs to back off.", "NTA. Don't feel bad. It's your wedding. Invite who you want. Your parents have no say. You were smart to reject their money to help with the wedding.", "NTA. My mother was like this, but since my parents paid for most of our wedding expenses, I wasn't able to say no. She even went so far as to call the reception venue behind my back and try to change the seating so her friends could sit closer to the front\u2014pushing my husband's relatives further to the back!

This person is important to your mother (for whatever reason), and it doesn't cost much to offer your mother this small kindness. \n\nWeddings are not only about families coming together; they are also about renewing and strengthening bonds within your own family. Inviting this long time friend of your mother does just that. \n\nBite the bullet. Agree to this one invite. If you're worried your mother will try and take the proverbial mile if you give her an inch, tell her that you're going to issue the invitation, but that she should not take this as license to do \\[whatever it is you're afraid she'll do\\].", "So what a lot of people on Reddit don\u2019t seem to understand is that there are other people who helped raise you that you probably don\u2019t know. These people have been there for your parents, supporting them when parenting is tough. These people have seen you grow up. Maybe they\u2019ve prayed for you. \n\nI have very dear friends who my children didn\u2019t know, but they sure knew my children. It gave them great joy, and me support, to see my children marry. And now that my kids are grown and gone, they are still there for me. \n\nThis is one reason why your mom may want this person at your wedding. Someday, if you have children, you\u2019ll understand. \n\nSo I hope you\u2019ll reconsider and see where she\u2019s coming from.", "If it's a single person, I would probably just let them come, but NTA if you don't do it.", "Look, it's your wedding, so it's your call on who gets to come. But, a NTA vote on Reddit is unlikely to change your mother's mind about wanting this friend of hers to be invited. Nor will it make her less upset. Try asking her why she wants this guest. And try to explain why you don't want someone you don't know at your wedding (practically speaking, your case will be stronger if this is a small wedding). However, if your mother persists, then you will have to decide if this is a hill worth dying on for you. What would be worse, a stranger at your wedding or an upset mother (and potentially other family as well)?\n\nNTA", "Exactly. Weddings aren't intended to be family reunions.

My husband and I paid 100% for our wedding. One day, my MIL asked us for \"extra invitations\" - ummm, what? Ended up she wanted to invite some of FIL's business associates and some distant relatives, people my husband either hadn't seen in 20+ years or never met at all. We certainly  had no interest in them attending our wedding. MIL was insistent.\n\nSo, we told her we'd give her the \"extra invitations\" IF she gave us $75 up front for each person she was inviting. We'd gladly refund her for anyone who declined.

It's also a strong justification for denying an unwanted request, especially when it could cost OP hundreds.\n\nThe friend is not even known to OP.  Doesn't seem appropriate for an intimate wedding.", "How is this not relevant to what you're saying, you want OP to add this one person to the guest list because the cost would be \"nominal\" (do you mean minimal?), and im asking you who this day is about that OP should try to appease her mom\n\nEdit: Aw cant handle a discussion?", "It's OP's wedding day (that she's paying for)not mom's.  That's about as relevant as you can get.", "Oh, good grief. Did you not read what I just wrote. It's a justification, but not a strong one or even a good one.

If I wanted to write \"minimal,\" I would have written \"minimal.\" \n2. Your rhetorical question doesn't go at all to the reasons OP is the asshole.\n3. You're not going to change my mind, and I'm not interested in a discussion or debate with you. Therefore, I'm blocking you now.", "Yeah, I just disagree. OP certainly *can* control the guest list. But the question is not \"can she do something\" but \"is she an asshole for doing something.\" Yes. Yes she is for reasons stated."]}
