We had close to 200 guests.

Our son got married.  We paid for the wedding.  (Yeah, I know, not traditional, but that's of no consequence.)  Again, I had the same argument with HIM.  There were about 60 guests (about 100 invited, but it took place in the bride's state, and we are from a different state that's a two-day drive away).  I went around and around with my son about the guest list.  He insisted he didn't want anyone he didn't know.  ME: \"But these are my cousins!\"  SON: \"I never heard of this person.\"  UGH.  We came to a compromise on a few names.  We ended up having precisely 12 people from our side who actually made the trip.  BUT: A bunch of my friends and relatives sent lovely gifts even though THEY WEREN'T EVEN INVITED.  My son called me: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSON: \"Who is this person?\"  \n\nME: \"Oh, that's my friend of 50 years.\"  \n\nSON: \"She sent us a really expensive gift from our registry.\" \n\nME:  \"Well, send her a nice thank-you note.\"  \n\nSON: \"But she wasn't even invited!\"  \n\nME: \"Yeah, remember that argument we had?  I would have put her on the guest list, but you wouldn't let me invite anyone you didn't know.\"  \n\nSON (sheepishly): \"Oh.  Yeah.  Well, we could send out some more invitations ....\"  \n\nME: \"It's too late now.  You didn't even send out the first bunch of invitations until four weeks before the wedding.  Now it's only two weeks away.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo ... these are just some things for you to think about.
