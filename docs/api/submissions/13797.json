I received a phone call from an exes family member telling me he had been in a serious crash and was in intensive care and that I was welcome to visit. They said it was a miracle he was alive as he was ripped out of the vehicle by passerby seconds before the car had caught fire. For backstory, I was in a relationship with this person for a quarter of my life, care for him deeply, and have maintained a close relationship with his mother as I was as close to her as my own, maybe closer. I wanted to go not only for him, but for the family I knew needed support. That being said, I was concerned about how my current boyfriend would feel about it, so I let him know what was going on and asked if I could go. He said go be with him you don\u2019t need permission, but when I got to the hospital, he flipped the script. Telling me he\u2019s done with me, I still love this person, I should be with him, etc. and that it was inappropriate to visit an ex in the hospital.

My ex was sitting in the corner by the window with a tiny teddy bear (he knows I love them) and some gift shop flowers.  He drove my husband to the hospital, and he drove my husband home.  His wife?  Texted to keep tabs on how I was doing, and we went out as a foursome to dinner once I was home and well into recovery.    \n\n\nThat jealousy green is never a good look on anyone.", "NTA\n\nJust because you break up doesnt mean you have to cut all connection, especially when you were so close with his family and when you were together for so long.

Him \u2018testing\u2019 you to see if you\u2019d go **even after he said it\u2019s okay** is a huge huge huge red flag. You didn\u2019t even have to ask how he felt about it, but you did which shows a lot of compassion and empathy for him. This controlling behavior will only escalate. He\u2019s extremely immature too. It\u2019s understandable to be concerned about someone you once loved even if you\u2019re not in each other\u2019s lives anymore. You deserve better than this weirdo.", "Nta - you hardly went there to reconcile and you have the courtesy to speak to your bf about it beforehand.\n\nFlipping like this is a mega red flag - so mega, there is no unseeing it and pls don't ignore it.", "NTA. He really had the best open window for comunication and yet he chose to be childish", "NTA. You are providing emotional support to the family and not visiting him as a lover.  your boyfriend is jealous", "NTA.  You were informed by the family of your Ex\u2019s condition because they obviously felt you had a right to know and because they wanted you to visit.  Breaking up with someone doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t allowed to care about them or their circle of family and friends that became your family and friends.  Your current boyfriend was given opportunity in advance to understand the situation, and then flipped out after you went?

It sounds like you and your ex left the relationship on amicable terms, so it\u2019s natural to still care about that person. And it\u2019s not like you went to go have dinner with him.

I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable that you visited him, and you informed your current bf, so it\u2019s not even like you were being secretive.", "NTA your current (soon to be ex I hope) is though.", "NTA. I agree with his first statement. You don't need his permission. Just to give him a heads up. Of course you still care in some capacity for your ex, and it's reasonable for you to go check on him. It doesn't mean you want to be with him. Though if he is on his way to recovery, it might be a good idea to distance yourself once more. It's not a healthy dynamic if you are visiting him every day or helping to nurse him back to health. A quick follow up text to see how he is recovering would be more appropriate.", "You sounds like a mature, caring person, but your current bf (hopefully soon-to-be-ex) is not, and to the degree that would be incompatible with you.

A quarter of your life is a significant amount of time and if you ended on decent terms, of course you\u2019re going to support the family. \n\nYour current boyfriend is gaslighting you which is a form of emotional abuse.

A partner says they don\u2019t mind X. Then decide they do and moves the goalposts to make YOU feel bad. Then it branches out to other things/conversations and blossoms into full on gaslighting.\n\nI would say he just started to feel insecure and it came out wrong \u2026. but with everything he said - that wasn\u2019t the case. He was flexing to see how much control he could have over you.", "NTA. You\u2019re currently in an unhealthy relationship.

NTA. He\u2019s a friend. His family is people you care about. Of course you went.", "You are not! Simply because that you went and visit him is not saying that you want to be back it just means that you care and want to give support. As if it was an old friend. And even more, that you asked him. He could have gotten jealous or whatever but not to the point of breaking up!", "NTA. Of course you would want to go see him in the hospital - given your relationship with him and his family, it would be like seeing any other close friend/family friend.\n\nYour bigger problem is not going to see him, though - it\u2019s your current BF.  He is clearly gaslighting you, and this is pretty reflective of somebody who is manipulative and potentially/probably abusive.  Do not cave to this. In fact, I would probably walk away. Abusive people like this are bad enough already, but when it involves an ex, it has the potential to go to the next level, which can be very very bad.", "I don't think either of you are AH. You've got a right to maintain contact with exes. He's got a right to not be in a relationship with someone that does. \n\nQuestion: if you leaned over and kissed your ex on the mouth, would he push you away because you're just friends? If the answer is no, you have to understand why your current bf might be hesitant about you maintaining contact.", "Your current bf has no intention of breaking up with you, he\u2019s trying to \u201cget the upper hand\u201d in the relationship.

I didn\u2019t want to include backstory on my current relationship to prevent negative bias to the answers. Impressed for you to have got that impression of him so soon", "This is the only answe", "I feel like the BF\u2019s actions made this an easy dunk so I\u2019m curious. In a world where the boyfriend didn\u2019t say anything until after OP had some time to process the situation and the ex is making a full recovery. Then informs OP that her relationship with her ex/ex\u2019s family makes him feel a little uncomfortable. Would he still be 100% the AH? \n\nImo if the situation was handled correctly by both parties no one is really the asshole. If I was in a relationship I feel like it wouldn\u2019t be an unreasonable request from my partner if they asked that I not see my ex anymore. That being said I also don\u2019t think it would be unreasonable if I decided I didn\u2019t want to make that kind of accommodation and we went our separate ways. \n\nIdk maybe people will just say I\u2019m insecure but, like is anyone that confident in themselves that they wouldn\u2019t be worried at all if they were in the BF\u2019s situation? I\u2019m not defending the BF\u2019s actions. As I said he obviously handled the situation poorly.

We share parenting tips, trade fandoms, and otherwise have healthy grownup relationships.  I am sorry your current boyfriend is incapable of such things.", "What he did is a major screaming red flag. And chances are where one is, there are more.", "If knowing more about your relationship would bias us against your bf, I think you know that this is not a good situation.", "Your bf said it was cool and then screamed at you once you were at the hospital...massive red flag.

Take care x", "I think its just become an (incorrect) catch all word for EA or even just disagreeing sometimes.", "No, that isn't gaslighting !
