He's been kinda stuck in the same position making the same amount of money for over 2 years now and things aren't really bright for him. I just graduated recently and because I'm more skilled in particular areas I was able to get a job that pays double the salary that he's been getting for a while now right from the get go. \n\nSo, I felt really awkward when he asked me how much I'll be getting paid and I didn't wanna tell him that it's double the amount that's he's making because I didn't want him to feel bad and I didn't want to see any envy or bitterness from his side since it's something that I experienced with him in the past, so I kinda downplayed it a bit. I still told him that I'm making more than him but I didn't tell him the right number I just downplayed it a bit.\n\nSo here's the issue, he knows the name of the company that I'm working for and it happened that he came across an ad that they posted, looking for applicants that are in the same position as I am and the company disclosed the average salary for that position. So he confronted me about it and was quite mad and upset that I lied to him about how much I'm making and I had to come up with a bunch of bs about how it's not the same position or whatever and he let it slide but I can still feel that he didn't quite buy it as he still made some snarky comments a couple of times in our conversation.\n\n Something that I also wanna share is that I'm a very private person when it comes to money and it's a touchy subject for me. No one knows how much I'm making, not even my parents (I'm living with them for the mean time until i save enough money to move out in the near future) and when my friend asked me I couldn't really just tell him \"it's none of your business\" since we're best friends and really close to each other, so I just chose to lie. \n\nSo AITA here?", "created_utc": 1691171486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15i6uid/aita_for_not_wanting_my_bestfriend_to_know_how/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
