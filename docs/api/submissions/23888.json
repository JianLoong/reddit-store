I still told him that I'm making more than him but I didn't tell him the right number I just downplayed it a bit.\n\nSo here's the issue, he knows the name of the company that I'm working for and it happened that he came across an ad that they posted, looking for applicants that are in the same position as I am and the company disclosed the average salary for that position.

If you wonder why your worker protections are shit, why your minimum wage is shit then you need to first look at the shit job unions in the US did at protecting those rights.  You are now 50-60 years behind the 8 ball and the way your political system has evolved over that time I seriously doubt that a lot is going to change in our lifetimes.\n\nHave a look at unions and working conditions in the EU, UK, Australia, New Zealand etc. to see the protections and working conditions your unions *could* and *should* have been fighting for back in the 50's to 70's to protect workers rights.\n\n> Pay transparency is a very good reason, and that's why it's a legally protected right.\n\nI absolutely don't dispute that pay transparency should be a legally protected right and that companies that retaliate against workers that *wish* to discuss their personal finances with each other should be held accountable.
