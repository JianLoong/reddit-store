Do you disagree with that?\n\nMy point is by not bringing up the primary salient feature the patient doesn't know how to properly fix the problem.\n\nLike you suggested you can drug people into being less stressed out, you can also do breathing exercises, you can also get something like an emotional support dog to break out of bad trains of thought when reliving trauma.\n\nThose solutions aren't apparent unless you are trying to reduce stress.\n\nYou cannot reduce past trauma.  \n\nFrom what I got from OP it seemed like she just wanted to accept headaches as symptom of past trauma.  You can't fix the past trauma though, you just have to live with it.  You can fix stress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso Jesus is a legit technique: Convince people that their own worldly problems aren't as big because their is larger purpose to life.  That living to that larger purpose is the most fulfilling act a human can do.  To the point where the larger purpose is more fulfilling than drugs or alcohol.  It literally works this is in \"The Big Book\" of AA.", "For sure"]}
