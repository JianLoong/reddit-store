Or not call them out for being stupid?", "Well as this sub likes to say \"fuck around and find out\". If you are financially dependent on someone else for your living arrangements then you have to accept that if you do something to upset them then it might result in you getting kicked out. You get same leeway if you're a minor since they can't legally kick you out although they can make your life hell in other ways. So if you're in a living situation where you can't afford to move out then sometimes you have to accept other people's assholishness in order to avoid homelessness. Yeah it sucks, but unfortunately that's how capitalism works.\n\nSo in the example you give the best policy would be to protect yourself by getting vaccinated secretly but not rub it in their faces until you're in a position to no longer need to live with them. Sometimes you need to not rock the boat in order to protect yourself.", "Incomparable.\n\nNot getting vaccinated can be a huge risk to health.\n\nSucking up your dislike for your mum\u2019s preaching in exchange for free housing is not that hard.", "I thought we were talking about a mother and son relationship and not a corporation. What's next? Draw up a contract when a child is born and list every penny the parents have paid with a repayment plan?", "Are you new to this sub or something? Like half of the posts here are about parents who treat their kids poorly. Yes, parents shouldn't get mad at their kids for disagreeing with them, but many of them do. Denying reality doesn't help anyone.", "Are you the entire sub? I was asking you a question. And i am struggling to find relevance in what you have said. I am not trying to be a smart alec. I am really not getting the context. The guy played a harmless joke on his mother. That's all there's to it.", "Ok, I honestly did read your comment as being a smart alec which is why I replied as I did. If you're generally trying to understand then I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe problem with the joke was that it wasn't harmless, it was mocking his mother's religious beliefs. I'm not of the opinion that you can never make fun of religion but mocking someone's beliefs (religious or not) is something that is very dependent on context whether it's funny or just you being an asshole. In this particular situation I think that OP was justified in the mockery due to his mother repeatedly pushing her beliefs on him against his will (essentially the \"she started it\" defense).\n\nHowever, just because something is morally ok that doesn't always make it a smart or sensible thing to do. Justified or not he was mocking her beliefs in a situation where he was living in her house apparently rent-free. Her kicking him out over this wasn't necessarily morally right on her part but it was something that she is legally able to do and a predictable response in the circumstances.\n\nSo the moral judgement on this hovers somewhere between \"NTA\" and \"ESH\" depending on personal feelings but whether or not it was a moral action on OP's part it was still a stupid action. Actions have consequences and being right doesn't insulate you from them. When I was a kid my mum used to use a poem about making sure to check for traffic before crossing the road, it's not a perfect analogy but I think the sentiment still fits here:\n\nHere lies the body of John Grey,   \nKilled exerting his right of way,  \nHe was right of course he was right all along,  \nBut he's just as dead as if he'd been wrong."]}
