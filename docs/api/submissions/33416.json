For instance, it can help children develop their socialization and communication skills by encouraging them to interact with others during tea parties. It can also help children learn about manners and etiquette by teaching them how to pour tea, use utensils, and serve food. Additionally, playing with a toy tea set can help children develop their imagination and creativity by allowing them to create their own stories and scenarios.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess that's what I would explain to my sister if I were you. \n\nAs far as buying it and having it at your home, would Alex tell his mom he played with a tea set at his uncle's house?", "Weak bait. \n\nPlus, YTA if you don\u2019t get him a drum set.", "It wouldn't be smart.

Don't undermine her parenting! You can argue with her and tell her your point, or you can go with Alex and look for something 'less girly' his mother would aprove.\n\nAlex is a young child, they change their minds rapidly. so he will not even remember that he wanted that toy, when he gets tons of other cool stuff for christmas.

It will set up a negative dynamic, and you may not get the same chance to be a positive role model. But if you don\u2019t upset your sister, you can show your nephew that toys, and nearly every other object that exists, have no relation to gender. I\u2019m a mom, and have been a teacher, and a nanny. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time around a lot of kids, and toys, colors, clothes\u2026none of that stuff changes who a child is.

He used the doll as a missile and the pushchair as a battering ram! \ud83d\ude01 He still enjoyed playing with them though, so as long as he didn't cause any injury or damage with them, he could do what he wanted and I didn't tell him how to play with them. I used to play make believe with my dad's chess and draughts set - same thing. It's a toy, there are no rules.", "YWBTAH for going against Moms wishes but the MOM is also the AH for being sexist.

Tell her you\u2019d expect her to support her son, regardless of whether he complies with gender norms and that honestly, you\u2019re kinda disappointed in her reaction to a very normal and age appropriate gift. \n\nYou can get him the tea set to play with at your house but I really feel like this is something worth having the big conversation on (assuming your sister is mature enough to listen to you).", "NTA. Perhaps you could get him a little cook set as well and tell your sister how all prominent chefs de cuisine are men. Then your sister will not bully the little one hopefully.", " . . . As the recipient of a IMPRESSIVELY failed multi-front attempt to infuse masculinity into my person in ways that bordered on abuse, NTA.  \n\nFirst off, he's a damn kid. He wants a tea party. I don't get the problem. Kids don't stay at the tea party age long. He'll probably be bored with it in no time.  \n\nSecondly, it can be very... Harmful. To the child. To have these imaginary lines they don't understand and suddenly get punished for crossing. Trust me. I've got the therapy bills. Good on you. Maybe try to talk with your sis and explain that \"he's just a kid that wants to have a tea party. You might have a better relationship with him if you grab a seat and join us and actually listen to why he wanted the tea set\".", "NTA but with your sister's attitude,  it sounds like if you were to buy it it will potentially cause issues for Alex - get him in \"trouble\" or lectured by bigotry, etc. Honestly, buy it for *yourself*, you can play with it when he's around AND show him that men can have things of any color too, which sounds like it's gonna be a valuable lesson with him growing up around your sister", "NTA but it is likely to cause your sister to be mad at you and if she\u2019s toxic, she may retaliate by either throwing out your gift (causing your nephew pain) or limiting the time you get to spend with him (which will also cause your nephew pain.) You know your sister best, so you will know if it is in any way a possibility. \n\nMaybe you should inform your sister that she pink used to be considered a masculine colour due to how \u201cstrong\u201d it is and blue was considered feminine because it is more \u201cmuted.\u201d But then Hitler decided to put pink triangles on suspected homosexuals in the army and suddenly it wasn\u2019t considered a masculine colour anymore. (The point being: colours are not gendered, it is entirely subjective and could easily change, the only reason people have gendered associations to colours is because they\u2019re taught to.) \n\nYour nephew would benefit from not having too much gendered bias affecting/limiting his ability to discover who he is and his likes and dislikes. Making him feel less of a boy because of the colours he likes is only going to make him internalise shame. \n\nEither way, I advice that you try to reason with her or at least inform her in advance that you will be gifting your nephew the tea set if that becomes a reality.", "NTA but she will not allow him to keep it.  It will be disposed of.  Another way to share it with him though is to have it in your vehicle and bring it with you when you visit.  Let it be special to the two of you to play with.

I should caution you, this would just be undermining your sister and will again lead to seeing your role in his life be reduced. \n\nThere is a golden midway here, though: you can tell her that it's not that he wants \"girly\" toys, but that he likes the idea of feeding others. How about a toy grill set? My nephew has one like that and it comes with its own utensils and some hamburgers. Hell, buy him some small plastic cups to go along with it so he can offer imaginary beverage to his guests along with the delicious plastic hamburger.\n\nThis is not the time and the place to start a discussion about \"should boys wear pink\" or something of that sort.
