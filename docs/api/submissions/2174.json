Just because a will names you as a beneficiary doesn't mean that asset automatically goes to you after the death. You can't just show up with a copy of the will, especially years later, and attempt to claim possession of an asset. A will needs to be tested via the process of Probate, where anyone who believes they may have a claim on the estate (can be personal entities or financial creditors) are given the opportunity to lodge their claim. The distribution of assets can be revised as the court sees fit and Probate is granted, which then allows the executor of the will to execute it. This process can drag out for months or longer and generally involves mandatory advertising in media for anyone who believes they may have a claim on the estate to come forward and lodge it. \n\nI find it impossible to believe that the ex-wife was permitted to just show up after the death, kick the OP and her mother out and take unofficial possession of this house. I would surmise that the most likely scenario is that during the process of Probate the ex-wife made a successful claim on the property and was legally granted ownership. As the OP's guardian her mother would have been party to the Probate process and as such, has lied to her for all of these years, making her believe she has ownership of this house when she never did. The OP did point out in the comments that over the years her mother has always been evasive about the property, discouraging the OP from making queries or visiting. Therefore this would totally make sense.", "NTA, speak to a lawyer.

With your dad still being married there might have been some issues with you even gaining the property. Maybe the prenup or default marriage structure where you live makes everything go to the longest living spouse. A will specifying otherwise doesn't trump marriage contracts or law. So even if he did will it to you, a lore strong contract ( marriage contract or general law ) moght have nullified the way the will wanted to split the inheritance. Hell even the way the 'trusts' were transferred/ inherited might have made for some weird implications.

The statute to contest is long gone. Your dad could have written a hundred letters in his last weeks, but unless these were properly executed,  they mean nothing.  \n\nI'm not sure where you are, but since you mentioned social security,  I'm assuming US.  In most states,  the legal wife is always awarded the lions share of the estate if there isn't a will.  And most states do not allow you to disinherit a spouse for cases just like this where there is another partner on the side.  After the spouse's share, the kids then split equally, unless there is a will, children can be disinherited and are not automatically entitled to anything.  If there is no will, then it will be an equal split of what's left AFTER the state minimum spouse's share (my state is a minimum of 60%) \n\nYou could have had a share, but only if your dad was on the birth certificate. If he was not, then it would have been up to your mom to prove that you are his kid and to fight for your share.

Your father's lawyer set this up and if there are problems with it, they aren't going to want you to know that. They could face malpractice claims. This should all have been resolved a long time ago and everything you inherited including the house (if you actually did) should have been in trust for you and managed by the trustee.

Is OP the AH if he exercises his rights to the house his father left him when Father died, if by doing so it causes his half brother to go to prison for outstanding warrants? The answer to this is no. If half brother did criminal things, he needs to be held accountable for those things, and it is NOT OP's fault. Also, how sure are you OP that there really ARE warrants and criminal charges? These people have lied to you and thwarted every attempt to get you the property you are legally entitled to. Everything your half brother said may be a lie. In any case, you are NTA for exercising your rights and getting the property your father wanted you to have and that you deserve. If your half brother DOES have criminal charges, it would be in his best interests to expedite your claim to keep them below the radar, dont you think?\n\nThe second part is sorting out the legal part of getting your house back to you. That will take paying an attorney to figure out exactly where you really do stand. It may be as simple as filing some paperwork.

The person who did wrong here was the executor of the estate (assuming OP's right and the house really should have been passed on to him) for not ensuring that it was kept in a way that OP had access to. (Brother could still go to jail for open warrants, but that doesn't mean that he's the one legally responsible for the house thing.)\n\nThe way I see it, there are two likely scenarios here: OP's father could have passed the house along to him, had the paperwork in order, and someone along the way really fucked things up. The worst case for the paternal family is if they committed fraud, but if there was an external executor who didn't preserve the asset, they're probably not at fault for trusting the executor. It's also possible that OP's mom dropped the ball and never asserted a claim to probate on OP's behalf, and in that case, the statute of limitations might have run already, so OP might not be able to make a claim. \n\nOr, the one I find more likely: OP's dad didn't really pass everything along to him. First of all, he was still legally married, and in many states you *can't* entirely disinherit your spouse, especially for assets that accumulated during your marriage. So OP's comment that he got everything aside from the siblings' trust funds raises alarm bells for me. (Caveat: some states might allow this, or might allow it if the spouses are legally separated, or they might have had a prenup that allowed this. But it's not common. OP also might mean that he inherited everything except the spousal share.) And crossing over with my first theory, if the paternal family made a big legal stink about things, and properly raised this issue during probate, but OP's mom never responded to the claim, and a court legally ruled in their favor, without any fraud, it might just be that the avenue to challenge this has closed. \n\nI still recommend that OP talk to a lawyer and figure this out, and also figure out whether there's any jurisdiction-specific rule about whether he could reopen probate since he was a minor at the time, but I really don't think it's fair to say that the brother actually stole the house from OP when we don't know what the hell happened.\n\nThe one thing that I feel pretty confident of is that OP doesn't have the house in his name currently, because otherwise he'd be dealing with property taxes and upkeep charges, or he or his mom would at least know how that was being paid for.", "Unless he forged OP's signature it's a civil matter, not criminal.", "I think the brother already has a warrant out against him so squatting nor the lawsuit is what actually gets him in jail if that\u2019s the outcome.", "Except he was still married to the brother\u2019s mom.

If not, then too bad for them.", "NTA, sounds like your brother isn't fit for anything and so is his wife so you may end up doing a favour to the kids.", "NTA. Your brother has warrants for things HE has done, that have nothing to do with you. \n\nI would absolutely take your house back. It belongs to YOU, not him, he\u2019s a nasty thief. Just because he wants it doesn\u2019t mean he gets it. \n\nTalk to a lawyer ASAP, ask about what you can do to be sure he doesn\u2019t destroy the house before he leaves, and then I would personally fix it up a little and sell it. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want any of your family members to know where you were living, to prevent them from harassing you or vandalizing the property.", "NTA, and definitely get the lawyer involved.", "Well maybe he shouldn't have stolen the house.  Consequences have actions.  Since he has active warrants out, it seems he has chosen to not learn that lesson.  Take your house back.", "NTA. Contact your fathers lawyer and get him out. He would have done the same. His and his wife criminal records are their own fault.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is playing a very dangerous game knowing he has active warrants. This is not your fault or responsibility because whatever he has done before, he probably needs to own up for it, anyway and face court. But that is not your problem and separate from your issue. I suggest if anyone asks, you claim ignorance on the warrants for your own sanity tho", "NTA. Talk to a lawyer. Get the house", "I\u2019d drop the dime because I\u2019m petty like that", "Civil matter. Evicting someone from your property doesn't come with jail time.\n\nNTA", "NTA but honestly you need to talk to your dads lawyer and get your own lawyer. Also the legal advice sub is probably better suited for you.", "send him to jail, he will be there anyway, those warrants will catch up with him.", "Thier legal troubles (warrants) have nothing to do with you. Those are from thier own choices.\n\nI would sell the house and move on with the $ as they would never leave you alone. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "You need a real estate lawyer. Also call LEO and inform them a fugitive is squatting on your property and you know he has active warrants. He can fight the eviction and properry seizure from jail.", "NTA. Your property.", "NTA\n\nWhy do you think someone with that sort of record would make a decent father either way?", "NTA. It's not your fault your brother's made some bad decisions in life. If he did the crime, he has to do the time. He can't avoid it forever. The house is rightfully yours. Make sure if you do decide to pursue getting it back, you take photos from the very first moment you set foot in the house so that if anything is in need of repair or needs to be replaced, it's on your brother and he can't try to say that he wasn't the one responsible for it.", "Kids or not, you do the crime, you do the time.

OP, listen to yourself. You seem more concerned about your brother and his kids and his wife than HE is. If he could go to jail for the stuff he's pulling, THEN HE SHOULDN'T BE PULLING IT. It's like if someone who has a warrant beats up someone else and then they end up serving a bunch of time... maybe don't beat up someone if you're trying to fly under the radar.\n\nYou tried to talk to him. He didn't want that. Your only option is to go a legal route, so do it! His consequences are HIS consequences.", "In my state, any property purchased while married belongs to both spouses whether or not both names are on the deed. One party cannot legally will it or sell it without the permission of the other. \n\nIf they were married when the house was purchased, the wife would have sole ownership when the husband died. That ownership cannot be willed away without the wife legally relinquishing ownership interest.", "> This has likely already occurred, if the ex-wife made a claim and was successful then the house would be hers.\n\nThe probate would be invalid if they falsified or omitted to give all the documents to the court.   If that can be proven, the property reverts to the intended beneficiary.", "The property would have been under the control of the appointed trustee until they reached their majority (or later if specified in the will)", "Catching people with warrants is actually why a lot of cops spend so much time pulling people over for small things, especially in high crime/low income areas.

So even if hubby left property to someone else, his widow has the right to live in the house until they die or move.", "> If the ex-wife was granted ownership of the property via the Probate process at the time of the father's death then there's nothing that can be done now, years later. \n\nNot true.   The court's primary interest is in protecting the minor child from this kind of thing.  It doesn't matter how long ago it happened or how others were able to evade presenting the documents.   If the guardian violated her duty as a trustee, that would be an additional crime to be prosecuted.", "That's not the way inheritances work.   If the court was deceived and not given full, accurate documentation, or if the minor child's trustee violated the provisions of the trust, the property reverts to it's intended owner.", "If he does have to spend any amount of time living in the house, he needs to change the locks, change his contact info, make sure the siblings, his in-laws, and possibly their kids, are blocked on social media. Block as necessary, be wary of anyone who suddenly is trying to talk to him nicely, and invest in a fire breathing dragon robot for the yard.", "> Let\u2019s say- the wife inherited after probate. \n\nIt doesn't matter if the probate process was corrupted by the wife's malfeasance.   The property would revert to the intended beneficiary.", "She could only be granted it though probate if she hid pertinent information from the court...in which case the house would revert to the OP.", "> The ex-wife may have made a claim on the father's estate and was rightfully granted the house via the process of Probate.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"rightful grant\" when essential documents were not presented to the court.  The OP was a minor and was cheated out of their rightful inheritance -- that's what the court will be looking at.", "That depends on where they are. If say op is in the US it's far more than 10 years. And if op is the owner even then they have to do it openly and malicious. Meaning it would need to be in the legal owners face. Right now op needs to speak to a lawyer hired by them. Generally it's about 20 years in the states and it does have to be out in the open meaning the legal owner must know of it for adverse possession to happen.", "Possibly, however, if the spouse was just a trustee, it is also possible OP is owed compensation for the house if the will put the house into OP's possession but the deed was not updated. OP's age will factor in here, as well, as he was legally unable to challenge himself.\n\nIf there was a legal sale, OP may not have rights to the house, but the mother's assets may be able to be siezed.
