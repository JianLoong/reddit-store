IT is more probable that the wife was joint-owner  (otherwise, I doubt your mom would have left).  Now that the ex is dead, it makes sense to sue her estate, but is that really your brother?

Just because a will names you as a beneficiary doesn't mean that asset automatically goes to you after the death. You can't just show up with a copy of the will, especially years later, and attempt to claim possession of an asset. A will needs to be tested via the process of Probate, where anyone who believes they may have a claim on the estate (can be personal entities or financial creditors) are given the opportunity to lodge their claim. The distribution of assets can be revised as the court sees fit and Probate is granted, which then allows the executor of the will to execute it. This process can drag out for months or longer and generally involves mandatory advertising in media for anyone who believes they may have a claim on the estate to come forward and lodge it. \n\nI find it impossible to believe that the ex-wife was permitted to just show up after the death, kick the OP and her mother out and take unofficial possession of this house. I would surmise that the most likely scenario is that during the process of Probate the ex-wife made a successful claim on the property and was legally granted ownership. As the OP's guardian her mother would have been party to the Probate process and as such, has lied to her for all of these years, making her believe she has ownership of this house when she never did. The OP did point out in the comments that over the years her mother has always been evasive about the property, discouraging the OP from making queries or visiting. Therefore this would totally make sense.", "NTA, speak to a lawyer.

They clearly know its not their house and they obviously know what they are doing is wrong. Zero pity.", "NTA, first of all go to a lawyer to review everything that has happened. With your dad still being married there might have been some issues with you even gaining the property. Maybe the prenup or default marriage structure where you live makes everything go to the longest living spouse. A will specifying otherwise doesn't trump marriage contracts or law. So even if he did will it to you, a lore strong contract ( marriage contract or general law ) moght have nullified the way the will wanted to split the inheritance. Hell even the way the 'trusts' were transferred/ inherited might have made for some weird implications.

The statute to contest is long gone. Your dad could have written a hundred letters in his last weeks, but unless these were properly executed,  they mean nothing.  \n\nI'm not sure where you are, but since you mentioned social security,  I'm assuming US.  In most states,  the legal wife is always awarded the lions share of the estate if there isn't a will.  And most states do not allow you to disinherit a spouse for cases just like this where there is another partner on the side.  After the spouse's share, the kids then split equally, unless there is a will, children can be disinherited and are not automatically entitled to anything.  If there is no will, then it will be an equal split of what's left AFTER the state minimum spouse's share (my state is a minimum of 60%) \n\nYou could have had a share, but only if your dad was on the birth certificate. If he was not, then it would have been up to your mom to prove that you are his kid and to fight for your share.

That isn't the case. The only thing that will send the brother or anyone else to jail/prison, is their own actions. \n\nOP, trust why you were left with the possessions you were left. There was a reason for this. Your estranged family doesn't seem to give any hoots about your welfare or well-being. They haven't given any effort at a basic relationship.

Have any of them tried to have a relationship with you? Ugh.", "But it's not technically in the OPs name.
