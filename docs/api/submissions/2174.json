Just because a will names you as a beneficiary doesn't mean that asset automatically goes to you after the death. You can't just show up with a copy of the will, especially years later, and attempt to claim possession of an asset. A will needs to be tested via the process of Probate, where anyone who believes they may have a claim on the estate (can be personal entities or financial creditors) are given the opportunity to lodge their claim. The distribution of assets can be revised as the court sees fit and Probate is granted, which then allows the executor of the will to execute it. This process can drag out for months or longer and generally involves mandatory advertising in media for anyone who believes they may have a claim on the estate to come forward and lodge it. \n\nI find it impossible to believe that the ex-wife was permitted to just show up after the death, kick the OP and her mother out and take unofficial possession of this house. I would surmise that the most likely scenario is that during the process of Probate the ex-wife made a successful claim on the property and was legally granted ownership. As the OP's guardian her mother would have been party to the Probate process and as such, has lied to her for all of these years, making her believe she has ownership of this house when she never did. The OP did point out in the comments that over the years her mother has always been evasive about the property, discouraging the OP from making queries or visiting. Therefore this would totally make sense.", "NTA, speak to a lawyer.

With your dad still being married there might have been some issues with you even gaining the property. Maybe the prenup or default marriage structure where you live makes everything go to the longest living spouse. A will specifying otherwise doesn't trump marriage contracts or law. So even if he did will it to you, a lore strong contract ( marriage contract or general law ) moght have nullified the way the will wanted to split the inheritance. Hell even the way the 'trusts' were transferred/ inherited might have made for some weird implications.

The statute to contest is long gone. Your dad could have written a hundred letters in his last weeks, but unless these were properly executed,  they mean nothing.  \n\nI'm not sure where you are, but since you mentioned social security,  I'm assuming US.  In most states,  the legal wife is always awarded the lions share of the estate if there isn't a will.  And most states do not allow you to disinherit a spouse for cases just like this where there is another partner on the side.  After the spouse's share, the kids then split equally, unless there is a will, children can be disinherited and are not automatically entitled to anything.  If there is no will, then it will be an equal split of what's left AFTER the state minimum spouse's share (my state is a minimum of 60%) \n\nYou could have had a share, but only if your dad was on the birth certificate. If he was not, then it would have been up to your mom to prove that you are his kid and to fight for your share.

Your father's lawyer set this up and if there are problems with it, they aren't going to want you to know that. They could face malpractice claims. This should all have been resolved a long time ago and everything you inherited including the house (if you actually did) should have been in trust for you and managed by the trustee.

Is OP the AH if he exercises his rights to the house his father left him when Father died, if by doing so it causes his half brother to go to prison for outstanding warrants? The answer to this is no. If half brother did criminal things, he needs to be held accountable for those things, and it is NOT OP's fault. Also, how sure are you OP that there really ARE warrants and criminal charges? These people have lied to you and thwarted every attempt to get you the property you are legally entitled to. Everything your half brother said may be a lie. In any case, you are NTA for exercising your rights and getting the property your father wanted you to have and that you deserve. If your half brother DOES have criminal charges, it would be in his best interests to expedite your claim to keep them below the radar, dont you think?\n\nThe second part is sorting out the legal part of getting your house back to you. That will take paying an attorney to figure out exactly where you really do stand. It may be as simple as filing some paperwork.

I know about your warrants and I don't want anything to happen to you or your family, so let's work this out.\"\n\n If you want the house, give him however much time you think is reasonable to move out. If you're okay with him living there, maybe begin to act as landlord and get rent from him, idk the world is your oyster. But he's a grown man and he has to live in reality and with the consequences of his actions. If this escalates and he refuses to be civil about it, take him to court.", "NTA. Sue that MF!", "NTA. It's your house. Good luck.", "NTA at all. I don't know why you mother let the ex push you both off since that house was left to you to be honest. This should have all been sorted out years ago. Sadly your brother clearly doesn't care about you at all. If the shoe was on the other foot do you think he would hold off suing you? Take him to court and get your property back and then sell it", "NTA,  i have zero sympathy for someone who acts like a jerk.  Even if he didn't have a criminal record, he has no right to the home.", "NTA, your brothers actions got him the warrants not you.  Serve him papers and have him removed.", "Sell it...\nNTA", "NTA: Your brother built a house of water soluble glass (sugar glass) and started a pissing war.\n\nHad he acted like an adult or just been less of a dick or not been a criminal him not going to jail would have been avoided.", "NTA go to court. He blocked you, he could have avoided this but he decided to be a jerk without taking into account the legal ramifications of this. Just because he has a kid does not give him a pass on his past behavior.", "NTA it\u2019s literally your house. You are not responsible for his actions that led to those warrants. He made those decisions. Sue him, get your house back.", "NTA if I were you I'd tell him that if he doesn't leave I'm going to pursue legal action which would result in his warrants putting him in jail.  \nThat way you have him the ends up to turn tail.", "NTA. To be fair, you are not the one putting his kids ar risk of anything  - they are by illegally squatting even though they have criminal records. Just go through the lawyers and leave yourself out of it - don't make any more personal contact. They blocked you because they are hoping this will all just magically go away.", "NTA. Your father left you that house in legally binding documents. Let your brother live with the consequences of trying to steal it out from under you.", "Well, that or the other outstanding warrants.", "I'm wondering if the house was paid off or not too. Even if it does belong to OP, 14 years of someone else paying the mortgage and taxes on the house is bound to make this less clear cut...", "FACTS! I work in Wills, Trust, and Probate Administration. The ex wife(which if they were never divorced is his ACTUAL wife) must have had some legal ground to stand on to claim possession of this property. Truthfully, OP needs to find the original title to the deed of this house. If Dad and his wife owned the house as Joint tenants with right of survivorship, then OP is super out of luck because the house will automatically transfer to the surviving the tenant. If they owned as it Tenants in Common, the dad\u2019s share would have to be transferred according to his Will. However, since it seems that it wasn\u2019t, and if OP was a minor when this happened then his mom would be the person responsible for signing a Private Family agreement that would give away their share to the legal wife. If this is US based, deeds can be viewed through the county register of deeds in which the property is located in. A lawyer can do it, but regular people can do it just as easily on their own.", "Seems like mom dropped the ball.", "Imo I think the lawyer is stringing him along. I don\u2019t see how OP has a legal claim, 14 years after the close of probate, specially given that the stepmom was still legally married to OPs dad. It also sounds like OPs mom never challenged probate on OPs behalf. I think he\u2019s SOL.", "I had a lawyer let me know what the bigger picture would look like for someone I was going to take to court a few years ago. I\u2019m glad they did, because as much as I didn\u2019t like the person who screwed me over, and they did screw me over, I didn\u2019t have an interest in them losing their job (which def would have happened) and potentially being deported (roughly 75%  chance it would happen). In my specific situation, those consequences were far greater than their crime. A good lawyer will let you make an informed decision.", "The state does probate. My guess is his mom dropped the ball in challenging the claim during the probate period. I doubt his claim, 14 years later will go anywhere.", "That\u2019s not how it works. You can\u2019t be too young to inherit.", "People here aren't lawyers so be wary of what they say. They don't even know what jurisdiction you are in and therefore don't know what laws apply here. Talk to an actual lawyer.\n\nI do note that in some countries the widow has the right to live in their dead spouse's home even if it was willed to somebody else. That doesn't necessarily apply if they're separated and living apart (so high chance of something fishy going on with his wife taking over). But the widow does not own the home, they just have a right to live there. If this is how it is in your jurisdiction, then she never had the legal right to pass it on to your brother. It's still your property. All this stuff they claim is probably legal nonsense, so talk to a lawyer. \n\nAs for him going to jail... You already lost your brother. As long as he lives there he won't be part of your life. Your brother doesn't want you around anymore because it makes him extremely uncomfortable. He chose to break with you so why care what he thinks? Your brother's wife can get help from relatives, benefits from the government and simply move somewhere else. Ask your lawyer about what her options are if that's bugging you. \n\nIf you do not push the issue, then years from now you are likely to regret it a lot. You're in the early years of your adult life so you probably feel insecure about your rights. It can be tempting to shy away from it all and rationalize giving up as generosity. Once you experience things a bit more your unwillingness to stand up to your brother will start to really gnaw at you. That's a lot of wealth he is stealing from you.", "Thank you for saying she was his wife. Depending on where the OP is located, the wife (whom the OP is calling the ex-wife) may have had rights beyond the will. I'm sorry, OP, that you were told your dad made sure he had everything in order. It doesn't sound like he did. You're NTA because you're going on what you've been told. Your dad's TA because he never got a legal divorce but started a second family, leaving everyone in this mess.", "He put up a fight beige doesn\u2019t want the legal headache. most people don\u2019t want that kind of stress in their lives even if they know they will win.", "how would an action to quiet title on the house result in someone going to jail?   It's a civil, not criminal action.   If he doesn't act soon, he will loose the house (if he hasn't already) to adverse possession.", "This would entirely depend on OP's jurisdiction. In my jurisdiction all courts and judges are considered a part of the judicature, and as such \"mandatory reporters\" of any criminal behavior they obtain knowledge of. So if a judge handles a case where someone might have committed a crime, said judge is supposed to forward the files to the district attorney's office. Which could lead to people going to jail.", "The brother has active warrants out.  If he goes to court, he would be arrested for having unserved legal process by the bailiffs.  If he fails to appear and a default judgment is entered in favor of OP, then local sheriffs would assist with the eviction and would then arrest brother for active warrants.\n\nThe only way going to court ends with brother not being arrested for his active warrants is that he avoids court and leaves the property of his own will before he is evicted.", "If the brother has warrants, wouldn\u2019t he get arrested as soon as the Trial was over?", "Ya. I don\u2019t see OP getting anything.", "Get an *independent* lawyer, not your dad's lawyer.", "Probably BEFORE. In the USA at least, you check in with a bailiff before the case and they are likely to run your name for warrants and have a police officer there to arrest you within minutes."]}
