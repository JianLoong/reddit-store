He has three older kids from his ex-wife, RJ(45m), Rain(47f) and Rose(49f). He was separated but not divorced from his wife when he and my mother (58f) got together. They had their own trust funds and when I was born he made me his sole beneficiary to anything and everything that was in his name (besides their trust funds ofc) and most specifically his house since his kids had their moms house. In my dads final days he made sure that all his assets were in order and that I\u2019d get everything I\u2019d need in life. He passed 7 days later. His ex-wife came to the property and kicked us out since they were still legally married. \n\nNow onto the problem: I\u2019m now of age and because of the housing market I want my house so I went to visit the area, for memories and to see if there way any damage since I haven\u2019t seen it since I was 6, but to my surprise, I found my brother on the property with his wife and family. \n\nI said hi and wanted to catch up because I do love my brother although he\u2019s never taken an interest in me, and instead of replying, told me to get off his property. Confused, I asked what he meant and he told me to screw off and he knows I\u2019m here for the house and that he and his family made it their home this year because his mother passed and unfortunately lost the house due to her gambling addiction (??) I asked if we could work out something but he again told me to leave. I don\u2019t know how he got the house. \n\nHe blocked my number, as did his wife, and refused to talk at ALL. I have it in writing that it belongs to me and only me, and my dads lawyer has been contacted and informed me that my brother has warrants and has a very bad criminal history, if I did take him to court he would serve a few years at least. He has a new baby and two kids under 6, his wife also has a criminal record, so I wouldn\u2019t want to do anything that would put his babies in danger or tear apart their family, but he won\u2019t reason with me and my other siblings don\u2019t like me so I have no one to talk to. WIBTAH?\n\nEDIT: hey! I know this post hasn\u2019t been up long but as many of you has suggested, I\u2019m gonna talk to my dads lawyer about everything, the possibility of squatting, the rightful ownership, my mother\u2019s involvement, everything, thank you so much, I\u2019m trying my best for someone who knows little to nothing and I really do appreciate every one of you especially those who\u2019ve raised concerns.", "created_utc": 1668317909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytszf9/wibtah_if_i_take_my_brother_to_court_even_if_itll/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not an arsehole for seeking your inheritance.", "So you\u2019re clear, you suing your brother will not send him to prison. That is not a possibility. The government would have to charge him with a crime. If you mean you making him come to the courthouse will get him arrested on his warrants, that is not your problem nor responsibility.

There is only one way, get your lawyer on it.", "NTA, kick him out.", "NTA sounds like good ol brother should've made sure his house was in order before trying to steal yours. I feel bad for the kids but that's on him and his wife.", "NTA. You're house. You owe him nothing.", "Evict him. If he doesn\u2019t leave and you have to take him to court then it really isn\u2019t of your doing if he ends up in jail, it\u2019s his. There is absolutely no reason for you to set yourself on fire to keep his thieving arse warm.\n\nETA: NTA", "INFO: how can the mom kick you out if it is under you name.\n\nOne last thing, you can do it to go down physically to the house and say it is under your name and what will happen if you take it to court. Of course, your brother will spew some vulgar words. But if he refuses to leave, you can take him to court and let him face his mistakes.", "This whole thing is a hot mess. \n\nINFO: How did your dad's widow sell the home if it is legally yours? It sounds like she inherited the home, not you and then sold it to her son. You may have a letter or such that gives you the home but without a probated will his legal wife would get the majority of the property. She wasn't an ex wife at the time of his death.", "You are NTA. Your father made sure that you would get the house, and your brother was provided for in a different way.\n\nAlso, if both your brother and his wife have a criminal history, chances are that their kids aren't too safe to begin with. I get that you feel responsible if either of them get locked up, but your brother knew the deal, and chose to go to war with you, instead of protecting his children.", "NTA. It sucks that the kids might suffer, but he messed up getting those warrants. You getting your house back won't send him to jail and had they just been reasonable all of this could have been avoided. He messed around, let him find out.", "NTA.\n\nHis prior criminal acts and warrants are not your problem.   He stole your house and you can and should take legal action to address that.", "INFO -- it is possible that the ex lost the house and had no assets for your brother to inherit.  It is possible that he took over multiple mortgages or had to outright re-buy the house.  We don't know. \n\n\nIt may have been yours when you were 6, but it sounds like no one actually put it in your name and never went after the ex to evict her, then it is very possible it STOPPED being yours long ago.  IT is more probable that the wife was joint-owner  (otherwise, I doubt your mom would have left).  Now that the ex is dead, it makes sense to sue her estate, but is that really your brother?  Did he actually get anything from her estate or was it all consumed in debt?   Again, we don't know.\n\nTo me, it sounds like he's being an asshole, but we also don't know what lies the ex told him about you, your dad and your mom.  He might think you are the problem.  \n\nSo here we are without enough information.  As far as you can see, he's being a grade A jerk ... if (and it is a big IF) it turns out that he paid for the house he grew up in, do you really want to take that away?  Would that change the equation for you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

The cops aren\u2019t reliable here. Sorry if it\u2019s confusing! I was kept in the dark for majority of this.", "That's where the OP loses me. That and not checking on the home or his guardian checking on the home in 14 years. If it really is the OP's home then it wouldn't have been under the wife's control for all this time.", "Ah, that might explain it, I was kept in the dark for majority of it seeing as my mother saw me as just a child being nosy, but from what my dads siblings told me, I was too young to inherit it and his wife ended up living in it for a bit, but moved out as she had her own house, I\u2019m not entirely sure of the situation and that\u2019s why I contacted my dad lawyer.", "Honestly, that\u2019s where I\u2019m considering dropping it, I need to know more things and that\u2019s why I want to talk to him, all I know is my father owned the house, it was fully paid off, it went to me. If it truly did stop being mine long ago why did he put up such a fight?
