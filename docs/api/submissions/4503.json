I can\u00b4t say I'm positive there's no reason, probably my sister was mean sometimes, but i think its too much.", "She's not actively mean, my sister really does not know my fiancee hates her, she thinks they\u00b4re good friends, she was a maid of honor at her wedding but couldn't attend because was living abroad, and was crazy expensive just to fly for a wedding. and yeah, ESH pretty much, I think is my fear of being alone that prevents me from running as fast as I can but today was the last straw, and I am currently asking opinions from strangers on the internet as one does lol.", "we were before she went abroad and I'm thinking of picking it back up.", "My sister was kind of a spoiled jerk a few years ago, but even then was never mean to my fiancee, I really don't know what is the issue", "Is it even a secret though!? It seems like she openly hates his family \ud83d\udc94", "All of this OP! NTA \n\nMarriage is about working together and compromising. \n\nPlanning your wedding out of pettiness to be the opposite of someone else\u2019s to this extreme is wild! Your fianc\u00e9e has some serious issues to deal with. \n\nYour family and her family sound very nice. Your fianc\u00e9e should be joyful that her family got along great with yours. Why is she so jealous of your sister?", "Thank you for your words, I really teared up a little bit, I do love her I can\u00b4t say everything has been horrible because it hasn't, we have had really great years even tho she always resented my sister, but it has worsened, I know she's under a lot of stress on her masters, but that's no excuse.", "I have asked several times and have never gotten past \"your sister is an asshole\" or \"she\u00b4s mean to me\" and well, they almost never spend any time together alone so I really don\u00b4t see it.\n\nMy dad gave us two small houses next to each other my sister and me, I\u00b4ve been living with my fiancee for the past 3 years in the house, and my sister started living next door just this week when she returned from her honeymoon, I believe this is what worsened everything, the idea that she\u00b4s our neighbor.", "My sister about 8 years ago was kind of a dick and she may have said something and apologized later, but as of late she\u00b4s been really nice to her, to all of her family at the wedding, and I guess she\u00b4s just jealous I guess, I have never gotten a straight answer", "Sorry English is not my first language I'll edit as best as I can", "By the fianc\u00e9\u2019s logic her own parents shouldn\u2019t be invited to her and OP\u2019s wedding since they attended the sister\u2019s.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Why are you marrying this person?  She sounds awful.", "I'm not going to call you an AH for it, but I'm going to say I think you're in for a world of hurt. Not only because she irrationally hates your sister, but because she's also showing you what a vindictive and jealous temperament she has. The chances this is a one-off are slim. You are setting yourself up for a lifetime of unhappiness by marrying someone who doesn't like your family when you love them. And I'd be terrified of who she might turn this venom on next. Your fiancee is definitely the AH, and you're NTA for wanting what you want, but you are being a real AH to yourself if you don't look carefully at this giant flapping red flag and evaluate what it means for you and your future.", "Do you think this will ever get better? Run. Run as fast as you can from this awful woman that you\u2019ve already wasted too much time with.", "It\u2019s your day too.", "The fact that your soon to be wife hates your sister for no reason at all is a BIG red flag. This is just throwing a dozen more at you. Please don't continue this relationship if she is not willing to reconcile with your sister and change/seek therapy. \n\nNTA. But you will be the AH to yourself and your family if you continue this relationship.", "Do you talk with your future in laws? Is there something from the wedding that may add context to this request? Or is this just your fianc\u00e9?", "You hope it was a made up story? You're the OP! Did you post a bunch of BS, then try to comment from your alt, but you're still on your main?!?\n\nDid you mean to say you wish it was a made up story, not hope it was a made up story?", "Honestly, I don't really feel comfortable with you guys marrying b/c either she is causing issues with your family OR she is not being forthcoming about a real issue.\n\nThis is obviously something that can happen, but sometimes when you are with someone so long, you forget that there are a million people out there who are potentially way kinder and less drama.  If your sister was the issue, I'd suggest minimizing contact, but it's your fiancee and you are not obligated to accept that (barring a very good reason).\n\nEDIT: You will be miserable, if this is how your life continues. AND THIS IS HER INFLUENCE WHEN SHE'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY!", "If you look back at your original post, you haven\u2019t said a single positive thing about your fianc\u00e9e. It makes me think she just isn\u2019t a very nice person but you feel obliged to keep going. Better to be happy and alone than miserable and married.", "Maybe make a list, write down all of the things you really like in your fiancee and then write all of the things you dislike. At the end, don't look at which side is longer, look at it and see which side means more to you. If one list is really long and the other very short, but made of the things most important to you, then listen to your heart. Don't think that 1. You will be lonely (it sounds as if you have a great family and you were able to live separately for a year now anyway), 2. That there will never be a new partner for you. If you're staying with someone because of the feeling of being together with someone, and not because you absolutely want to spend every moment of the rest of your life with this person, then it's not the best reason I fear.", "I\u2019m sorry, your fianc\u00e9 agreed to be the MOH of someone she secretly hates and then didn\u2019t even attend the wedding because \u201cflights are expensive\u201d?! How far in advance of your sister\u2019s wedding did your fianc\u00e9 tell her she wasn\u2019t attending?", "She not only hates your sister, but is two-faced as well, pretending to be friends with her. So much trouble here, OP. Don\u2019t let sunk cost fallacy make you waste the rest of your life.", "Jealousy", "Are you looking forward to a lifetime of never seeing your family if your sister is there?  The fact that there appears to be no justifiable reason to her hate is actually disturbing.  Who will be next?", "Very true. And if the family doesn't suspect, would you really want to be married to someone who could lie so easily or be that two-faced?", "Good luck, it's time to get to the root of the problem.  You cannot marry her until this is addressed, and her being away you have time.  Postpone the wedding planning until you guys have had a chance really talk.  This can cause a rift in your family and relationship that may damage you and your family.\n\nNo one should be treated this way.\n\nGood luck", "Do you have any idea why your fianc\u00e9e dislikes your sister so much?", "if you are not getting an answer and she keeps evading the question by the sounds of it.  then maybe tell her the engagement is off until she can answer what the reasoning is to why she cant stand your sister.  if it doesnt get resolved it will come to head and its coming sooner rather than later im afraid", "I could see not liking my future SIL if she was always rude to me, even if she changed later. I could also understand to not invite her and limiting contact, depending on the extend and actions of the future SIL. But to put that much energy into not having anything like her? That is just crazy. Is your fianc\u00e9e so jelous in other parts? Is your future wife looking for an excuse to make wedding planning as uncomfortable for you as possible so she is not the one to call it off? Long shot but this is just so off...", "Now that I can read it better: NTA. Your fianc\u00e9e sounds very manipulative, controlling\u2026and just plain mean. This is your wedding too, OP. If she can\u2019t give a little, then the wedding should be postponed. Don\u2019t become an unhappy guest at your own wedding.", "With his facts, yeah he is N T A, but I have a feeling he is leaving out some parts of the story, or maybe he is dense and just refuses to see why his gf hates his sister, I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out the sis antagonize the gf and OP doesn't sees it because she is family. Or he could be honest and the gf is just crazy, whatever it is I don't trust his story if he doesn't even know why the gf hates the sister, so much time together must've given him an ideas at least.", "OP wanted to say that he wished the story wasn't true because then he wouldn't be set to marry a person who is not good to and for him.", "yeah, I wish it was, sorry English is not my first language, and struggle with grammar.", "100% OPs fiance is the type that will get irrationally jealous of his family and cut him off as soon as the ring is on her finger. The things he's seeing here are only the beginning and I suspect she will start ramping up the trash talk now that he's shown he's willing to let her have her way (mostly). \n\nImagine raising a family with someone like that. No thanks.", "this"]}
