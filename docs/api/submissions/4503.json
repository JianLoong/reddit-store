If your fiance won't let you have these moments with your family she shouldn't be your fiance.  End of story.", "YTA for choosing to marry someone like this. Why are you okay with her being this way towards your sister? Good luck to you bc I\u2019m sure you can expect to have a whole lot of drama in your future.", "NTA\n\nDo you really want to marry someone who hates your sister??\nYour sister has no idea because she's done nothing to warrant it   \nIt's seems like your fianc\u00e9 either has an issue with you showing affection to others, or nice things happening to other people? Which isn't healthy for anyone\nYou should have a say in your wedding, it's your day too\nYou should dance with your mom to whatever song you want to. Love doesn't keep you away from any possible joyful and/or special moments \n- At least when those moments are safe to you and others, like dancing with your mom to a song that special or having a venue with any similarities to the wedding your fianc\u00e9 wasn't even there to experience", "Buh bye!NTA", "Your fianc\u00e9e may have drama with your sister. Fine. Not everyone is going to like each other, and as long as they're fairly civil that's reasonable. \n\nWanting to have a wedding day that's special and unique to you, also fair and reasonable.\n\nBut refusing to allow your SO to dance at his wedding with his mom to her favourite song, that's special as it reminds her of her dad? That's just wrong. It's 5 minutes of the day to acknowledge family. \n\nOP, NTA, but if this is not wedding behaviour and a pattern, really think about your relationship. You have put in the effort, and it's hard to let go after that long, but your happiness matters more.", "Just want a clarification. You\u2019ve been dating 10 years and her family hasn\u2019t met yours?", "Why would you willingly marry someone who hates your sis for no reason?", "Info: *why* does she resent your sister? Is something missing here?", "Why? Why bother trying to make things work, with someone who is terrible, and you even admit that she's mean, to your sister and mom.\nShe secretly hates your sister, which seems extremely immature for someone getting their masters and preparing to marry into the family.\n\nRUN!!!!!! \n\nDivorce is really fkkn expensive, and you don't want to waste your youth.", "This. Absofreakinglutely!  OP, get out while you can.  Maya Angelou said, \"when someone SHOWS you who they are, believe them.\"   These are not the actions of a rational person  or even a nice person. You are in for a lifetime of divided loyalties, turmoil, drama, and pain if you marry her.", "This OP, you need to understand exactly what it is about your sister she doesn't like, especially if you're going to be neighbours."]}
