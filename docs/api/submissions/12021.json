A miscarriage is a traumatic thing, and she should understand this.", "Nta. She is being very insensitive. Yes, it's a wonderfully exciting time for her. A time you both thought you would be experiencing together. She needs to be more understanding of what you are going through and that you can't just switch from grieving to cheerleader for her.", "NTA, your \"friend\" is being insensitive. Its kinda of normal, since miscarrying is an invisible thing thats not popular to talk about in society yet happens to a quarter of women.\n\nMy first reaction would be to ignore this \"friend\" and break off contact, but if you want to keep her you need to sit her down and explain to her that you are experiencing loss, and the lack of support she showed towards you will be answered with lack of support from your side.\n\nSource - went through 7 of these with my partner", "NTA and I think it\u2019s important to remind yourself that maybe it\u2019s not that you \u201caren\u2019t excited for her\u201d and more than you\u2019re sad for yourself which is expected and okay after what happened. She\u2019s an AH for saying you should be over it already I\u2019d ask her how she thinks it\u2019s fair to expect you to be happy for her when she\u2019s not equally sad for you. She needs to have some empathy because it can happen to anyone and we all would want some kindness in your position. I hope you\u2019re doing as okay as you can through this and I\u2019m sending you a big hug honey. I\u2019m so sorry", "Slightly appalled at the few \u201cN A H\u201d responses. Obviously it\u2019s super ok to tell someone, who lost a child recently, that they aren\u2019t excited for your own child and scold them for it. NTA.", "NTA all of your feelings are valid and SOME of hers are too. She should have never told you that you should be over it by now, and she\u2019s coming at it from the completely wrong way. It\u2019s just a really tough situation where there\u2019s not a lot to do to fix it except maybe distance yourself for the time being and be as supportive as you can from afar (unless you can\u2019t forgive her for what she said which is completely understandable because that was wayyyy harsh).", "NTA and you need better friends if she cannot understand how this is a hard time for you right now. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA- just as your friend was uniquely unqualified to support you, she should have recognized that you're not in a position to support her. This relationship needs distance", "NTA. Going through a miscarriage is hard as is, and dealing with one as a friend is pregnant is a rough thing to go through. If your friend wants you to be supportive, they should acknowledge that you also need support.", "A miscarriage is so much more then the loss of a foetus, it\u2019s the loss of your hopes and dreams for the little person your creating. \nNTA at all. Your so called friend is definitely the AH for being so insensitive. Giving you tips on how to conceive is very rude. \nI\u2019m So sorry for your loss.", "NTA I had a friend who lost a late stage pregnancy when I was pregnant she was about one month ahead of me,  I couldn't support her because I couldn't deal with the fear the same could happen to me, I sent my condolences then we stayed mostly away from eachother for a while (mostly till they were pregnant again)  I sure as anything didn't expect her to have any excitement over my pregnancy, I didn't want to be a constant reminder, I her supported where I could and expected nothing from her.  We are still friends and respecting the fact that the best thing we could do is give space given the situation is why we still communicate.  She shouldn't be expecting anything from you at this time, OK it was early but she doesn't get to decide how quickly you are ready to deal with things. Sorry for your loss.", "I\u2019ve had 6 miscarriages (and a few kids). Each one was very painful but the first was devastated and the stress from that loss affected my ability to conceive. \n\nYour friend is really insensitive, I\u2019m so sorry. Take a step back from the friendship, let her know you care about her but you need some space for a while. \n\nIf she can\u2019t accept that then maybe the friendship isn\u2019t worth hanging onto. I lost two friendships due to how they treated me while I was grieving.\n\nNTA", "NTA She isnt your friend. Stop calling this heartless person your friend and move on. She has no empathy or respect for you. This isnt friendship.", "NTA. \n\n>She told me that I should be over it by now\n\nWords fail me.", "Nta - if she can\u2019t understand how you are feeling then she\u2019s not a good friend and you should distance yourself from her", "NTA - your friend is though\n\nNobody has the right to tell you when you should or shouldn\u2019t be over something - especially that important\n\nYou lost your child\u2026 and I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that. \n\nPraying for your healing, and that you find better friends", "NTA. I'm sorry to hear about your miscarriage. I cannot imagine how difficult that must be.\n\nWhat I can say is this; if I had a friend that told me that I \"should be over it\" by now, they would no longer be my friend.", "NTA ---  what a horrible and cruel thing to say to you whether you were 8 weeks or 8 months you lost a baby and then to say you should be over it by now, this person is not your friend.", "NTA, pregnancy is a hormonal fucking slap in the clit. my miscarriages fucked me up more than any people that beat me or mentally abused me and it\u2019s a hell of a lot harder than pregnancy with birth. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss hun. I hope you get blessed with a rainbow baby when you recover and are ready for one", "NTA\n\nthis is not a friend. i would distance yourself further as this will not improve.", "NTA. You've had a huge loss. She should be supportive, compassionate, and understanding  -- things an actual friend would be. \nI am so very sorry for your loss.", "NTA x100000%", "NTA. Your 'friend' is a selfish, insensitive AH. Find more supportive friends. Dump her narcissistic ass. I'm sorry for your loss btw, miscarriage is awful at any stage in the pregnancy.", "NAH. People don't understand that there is a release of hormones in the brain that actually make you feel the loss. It's easy for someone to think \"just have another one\" but it's not that simple. She just doesn't understand that. \n\nJust do what makes you feel comfortable. But don't do anything you'll regret. Will you regret not being there for your friend? It's up to you.\n\nI hope you find a way to heal. Time will help!", "NAH here, just two women experiencing different outcomes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
