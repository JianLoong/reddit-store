A time you both thought you would be experiencing together. She needs to be more understanding of what you are going through and that you can't just switch from grieving to cheerleader for her.", "NTA, your \"friend\" is being insensitive. Its kinda of normal, since miscarrying is an invisible thing thats not popular to talk about in society yet happens to a quarter of women.\n\nMy first reaction would be to ignore this \"friend\" and break off contact, but if you want to keep her you need to sit her down and explain to her that you are experiencing loss, and the lack of support she showed towards you will be answered with lack of support from your side.\n\nSource - went through 7 of these with my partner", "NTA and I think it\u2019s important to remind yourself that maybe it\u2019s not that you \u201caren\u2019t excited for her\u201d and more than you\u2019re sad for yourself which is expected and okay after what happened. She\u2019s an AH for saying you should be over it already I\u2019d ask her how she thinks it\u2019s fair to expect you to be happy for her when she\u2019s not equally sad for you. She needs to have some empathy because it can happen to anyone and we all would want some kindness in your position.

It\u2019s just a really tough situation where there\u2019s not a lot to do to fix it except maybe distance yourself for the time being and be as supportive as you can from afar (unless you can\u2019t forgive her for what she said which is completely understandable because that was wayyyy harsh).", "NTA and you need better friends if she cannot understand how this is a hard time for you right now.

If your friend wants you to be supportive, they should acknowledge that you also need support.", "A miscarriage is so much more then the loss of a foetus, it\u2019s the loss of your hopes and dreams for the little person your creating. \nNTA at all.

We are still friends and respecting the fact that the best thing we could do is give space given the situation is why we still communicate.  She shouldn't be expecting anything from you at this time, OK it was early but she doesn't get to decide how quickly you are ready to deal with things.

Take a step back from the friendship, let her know you care about her but you need some space for a while. \n\nIf she can\u2019t accept that then maybe the friendship isn\u2019t worth hanging onto.

My friend and I were two weeks apart. I miscarried at 10 weeks. My husband is a Dr and we had discussed this possibility for various reasons and whilst I understood why it happens and coped quite well, it was still a sensitive subject.

Grief can last a long time, regardless of how far along you were. Please consider seeking therapy though, to help you process what has happened.  \n\n\nWhen I was expecting my first, my friend lost hers at around 10 weeks (I was about the same far along at the time).

She told me she was grieving, yes, but she was also happy for me too, and I shouldn't be afraid to mention it to her. However, I was still mindful of her loss and kept my pregnancy talk to a minimum (\"How are you and baby doing, No\\_mango8923 ?\", \"Oh yes, all going well thanks...\" and then I'd switch the conversation to how she was doing and other topics unless SHE wanted to talk more.) \n\nThere is no set time frame for grief.", "NTA\n\nShe is a horribly selfish friend. She doesn't care about you, she just wants attention.", "NTA. I have had 2 miscarriages,  my first and fourth pregnancies.  You need to put yourself first right now.  You get to grieve.  You get to yell it's not fair. You get to cry. If you're religious, I will give the advice I got from a nice nun I knew. Go ahead and yell at God, he has big shoulders.  \n\nI will pass.  You will still tear up when you think of them.  I still do and my children are all adults.", "Yeah. The friend immediately trying to give OP tips on how to conceive again is also heartless (OP said convince, but I'm sure it was a typo). \n\nFor starters, I think most people know how it's done and don't really need any tips. The bigger issue is that the friend trying to push OP to immediately get pregnant again is incredibly insensitive after what she went through and while she's still grieving.", "So she's not an asshole for saying she should be over it? Regardless of not understanding the loss, she should know that's a horrible way to approach her friend"]}
