(Or a little bit Y T A but only for the way you spoke to your wife)\n\nI\u2019m not sure if anyone has talked to you about this, but with Alzheimer\u2019s, it only gets harder for them to adjust to a care home, the longer you wait.  If they go into care while they\u2019re mostly still there, they can still learn that this place and these people are now their home.  They still have the ability to reason that much at least some of the time.  The longer it\u2019s delayed, the less they are able to adjust.  My mom\u2019s family kept my grandma in her children\u2019s homes as long as possible.  When she was finally put into care, every interaction with anyone she recognized involved her begging to go home.  Asking when we were taking her home.  Demanding to know why we weren\u2019t taking her home.  Sometimes meltdowns over \u201cthat place\u201d not being home.  She didn\u2019t have any ability to adjust left at that point.\n\nHaving said that\u2026choosing to be a caretaker is a CHOICE.  You\u2019re not wrong choosing to be her caretaker\u2026but your wife is also not wrong for not choosing the life of a caretaker.  It\u2019s a hard life with a lot of sacrifices.  The fact that you want to make them and she doesn\u2019t is simple incompatibility.  She\u2019s not childish for not wanting to sacrifice her life for your mother, and it was unkind and unjust to call her that.", "Question, did you talk to your wife about this before making the financial decision? \n\nAlso, where is your mom staying? In your home with a care nurse?", "INFO: Can you sustain the expense for the rest of your mother's expected life expectancy? Instead of quantity of time spent making memories, will quality suffice? Are you inadvertently willing to sacrifice your relationship to care for your mother?", "I sympathize with you, but I also work in elder care and understand fully how you\u2019re wrecking your wife\u2019s life. You should accept that she isn\u2019t willing to live this way, potentially for 5-15 years. I\u2019m too sad for all involved to pass judgment.", "NAH I'm very sorry about your situation. The life of a carer is very hard and it's a choice to make. You have all the right to make it and so does your wife. If you want a good life you cannot impose it on her as much as she cannot take you out of it. \n\nSome counselling could help to see if you can find some compromise, but it could end up that you'll be going different ways.", "NAH. I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I would do the same for my mom but I also understand your wives pov. You guys may not be suited anymore.", "Heartbreaking situation.  \n\nI've cared for an elderly parent, and one of the things that is most difficult is the uncertainty.  If your mother had a terminal illness and six months to live, I expect your wife would be on board with giving her all the love, care and attention you possibly could.  But your mother may live another ten years, getting gradually worse, as her personality crumbles away but her body continues to be strong.  Is what you are doing at present truly sustainable?  What if you get burnt out after seven years, at the point where your mother needs even more help?  You are looking at an intederminate but long-term future here.  Be sure you can deal with it, financially, physically and emotionally.\n\nI used to fantasize about murdering my parent.  A clean, quick death and an end to the constant tension, disruption, sleeplessness and fear.  It added to the burden I felt, because nobody wants to be wishing someone dear to them would die.\n\nYour wife has told you she cannot live this way any more.  This is undoubtedly not what she signed up for - she wants a partnership with you, not a situation in which the better part of your attention is elsewhere.\n\nIf you want to keep her, you need to have a re-think about how you are handling the situation.  A long, careful talk with your mother's doctor and/or other medical professionals *who are not personally involved* may be what you need.  Unbiased advice on the best way to care for her.  You are aware of the facts, but you are emotionally involved because she is your mother and you love her\u2014and good for you, being aware of how much she has done for you and wanting to care for her in return.\n\nThere are no good answers here.  But if you want to both care for your mother and keep your wife, something obviously has got to give.  If on the other hand you believe your wife is being unreasonable - which may be true - then the marriage is basically over.\n\nNAH.  Good luck.", "NTA. It's a horrible place to be, but suggesting you let your mother dwindle because \"you should be creating experiences\" is disturbing to me. \n\nI expected to be more sympathetic, but given that her reasoning appears to be larger about this being a big old downer (which it is!), and the fact it wouldn't actually be cheaper to move her, the request sounds like \"spend less time with her.\"\n\nI definitely am sympathetic to her looking down the gun of years of this, but it's still horrendous to ask that. Assuming your wife is a good person, I doubt she's really thought about what she's asking, because it's horrible. \n\nWould couples counselling be an option? This situation is pretty much perfect for it. I have to say, I wouldn't blame her if this was too much for her to stay. If not now, later. But I also couldn't live with myself not doing all I could in your position either.", "What a horrible situation to be in with your mother and I am so sorry her and you are going through that.\n\nNAH\n\nI believe firmly in what you\u2019re saying and agree with all of it. Homes like that won\u2019t make much of a difference while also bleeding much faster. I get your stance on this 100%. She\u2019s, for a lack of a better word, dying slowly in front of you and you\u2019re doing everything in your power to make sure it\u2019s a good experience for her. Did the same with my father when he passed away, the money did not matter and eventually we bounced back financially from that.\n\nBut I also understand where your wife is coming from in this, I don\u2019t agree with it, but I understand. If she is threatening divorce over you taking care of your terminally mother? That is uncalled for and, honestly would be childish. I wish I could give better words in all this, other than I wish you the best of luck and just hang in there.", " Info - this wasn\u2019t out of no where right? Did you discuss and make an agreement with your spouse before you took this, your mothers care,  on?

What would your wife say is the biggest concern right now and how are you working on maintaining y\u2019all\u2019s relationship right now?", "NTA but neither is your wife. You admit in the comments that although you\u2019d discussed caring for her mother, you also ultimately made the decision without really talking to your wife about it.\n\nMy aunt cared for my nana with Alzheimers for 11 years. She wound up having to give up work and was housebound and burnt out by the caring role - not to mention the financial impact. My nana wound up so high needs that getting her into a home was impossible and respite was v limited. You and your wife need to sit down and discuss what this means for you in the short and long term, and it has to be a joint decision.", "NTA. What you do should be totally normal", "NTA, she is being childish. Going into debt or sacrificing true essentials would be a bad choice, but giving up \u201cextra vacations and freedoms\u201d for your mother\u2019s quality of life, especially considering how hard she clearly tried to raise you, is a no brainer. \n\nThe only instance I could imagine of you being TA is if she vastly outearns you and is spending a significant portion of her money on this, but that doesn\u2019t sound like the case.", "NTA - I believe she is being selfish. Her frustration or sadness is understandable, but in the grand scheme of what\u2019s going on, there are more important things to handle. Vacations come and go, you only have one mom, and I think it\u2019s admirable to make sure she\u2019s properly cared for to the best of your ability.\n\nLife deals us a shitty hand sometimes, and as adults we have to roll with it.\n\nFull disclosure - I am a biased sort, I think western culture, in general, treats our old people shamefully. Sticking them in homes, rarely visiting because we\u2019re *so busy* with our lives, treating them as inconveniences to our more important lives. I\u2019m not saying people should devote their entire existence to their care and give up everything long term, but we should be willing to make sacrifices for those that sacrificed for us. \n\nI am very sorry you and your family are going through this.  Alzheimer\u2019s is a rough road. Be kind and compassionate to yourself and each other.", "NTA - you're paying with your own money, not hers. The bills etc are paid, she needs to mourn holidays she cannot pay by herself. So this part is selfish.\n\nBut I understand that she may want to pull out of the caregiver life.", "Nta", "INFO: Who is taking care of your mother when you're working those long hours? If it's your wife, then Y T A. If you're paying for a care taker, then N T A.\n\nEdit: given OP's answers to my question and his other comments, I vote NTA.

Hard to going from nearly no restrictions to having restrictions especially in the case of my wife since while we did split the expenses, my larger income did supplement a larger portion.\n\nThird question, I love my wife, and I also love my mother. I would not be the person I am today without either of them. I was never good with women or anything like that, and my wife is very special person to me and I do not want to lose her, but even still my mother is also a special person and I do feel it is unreasonable to ask someone to choose between important people.", ">Thankfully outside of the Alz she is in wonderful health with no other underline health conditions.\n\nOP's mother could live 20+ years.

As I told my wife, if she wants to divorce or take a break I do understand, no one expects to care for a parent with Alz and I get it. This is not how I expected our lives to go. \n\nI also do agree I do not think she meant what she said either or meant it in the way it came off as. I get she is frustrated, as am I. This is pardon my language a f--ked situation across to be in especially before hitting 30.", "My wife knew I was going to take care of my mother, I just never thought or expected it to become to such a degree at such a young age. As far as discuss I cannot say in good faith I had a fair discussion, as my mind was 100% already made up she is my mom and I am going to do everything I can do give her the best possible life. Just as if it was her family, I would also do the same, it would not even be a discussion it would more so be, well what can we do to help. \n\nIn terms of spending we have always operated on share everything, and since I do make more money and had less expenses I did cover a larger portion of costs related to outings and the like. We do evenly split housing costs though. I had no problem with this since I did not have student loan debt, and I did make more then my wife. As for current spending everything relating my mother's care comes out of mine income, I am also still contributing the same amount to our family saves, and retirement. I have broken one agreement that when we get raises we put the extra income into savings and retirement. Instead currently I am using the extra income to pay for my mother's care. \n\nTo be honest, I am as dense as they come, so I cannot even fathom what her largest concern is, though if I had to guess I would say a large part of it is the loss of time spent together. I also feel the same, and I also acknowledge I need to find a better work like balance cause right now I am pushing myself. I tend to hyper focus and thrust myself into that task in the moment and in consumes me. I do my best to make time for my wife, as an example I do have a trip already planned for her birthday in two months. I know it sucks that at times some of the free time I have left I do spend it with my mom, and I wish I could have my wife be part of it.

It's a marriage, they're supposed to talk about it and figure out how to make it work. It's equally wrong to just make a decision that's a financial strain, a time strain, and an emotional strain (which he did) without consulting and talking to your spouse.\n\nMy parents went through the same thing when my grandma got Alzheimer's. She moved in, we tried taking care of her but she needed 24/7 supervision, doors needed to be locked at all times or she'd wander off, she almost set the house on fire, she got progressively aggressive etc. The setup only lasted several months before she had to be put in a care facility for our and her own good.\nIt was hard on all of us but it needed to be done. \n\nThe same is inevitable for OP. I'm not sure whether he's aware what's ahead, because it won't be manageable if he wants to keep his sanity, marriage and so on.

If what she is doing is wrong, it is no more wrong than what he has already been doing to her.", "If your mind is made up to care for your mother yourself then you need to communicate that with you wife, and underline the fact that there is no room for negotiation here. If no other option for care exists outside your home (eg: no care facilities, not buying a flat and paying for a full-time carer to look after your mum, etc) then your wife needs to have that information so that she can decide if she wants to proceed with the marriage. It's the only fair option to her.\n\nYou are allowed to 100% control the type and level of care your mum receives, but you have to know that there will be consequences for what you choose. If you are unwilling to compromise in any way then you are faced with Sophie's Choice - choose your mum and you eventually lose your wife, choose your wife and submit your mother to the mercy of whatever care provider you select for her. As it stands right now you can't have both, unless you seek a compromise.", "Don't forget, regarding question two, if you guys were planning kids, that might be out of the question with your mom present, considering you've mentioned she's combative. That's a person who might hurt a child, so I wouldn't want to have kids around her, and I doubt your wife would either, if you guys were planning kids.", "We never put a hard yes or no to kids, we were both on the fence. I will admit I am more on the no side of the fence she is still in the middle. To be fair, I would understand if she wants to take a break, leave or what have you. My issue more so comes from the idea that she tried to make me choose, it came off as if she was trying to make this my fault.\n\nIf she is no longer happy with me fine, I get it.

You know it is going to change things even more in the future, right?\n\nIt will possibly (likely) affect your longer term decisions as a couple, including whether you have children, since that is still under discussion.\n\nYour wife has mentioned couples counselling as an option to you, so that suggests this topic has been a concern for a while and probably discussed more than once, so any \"ultimatum\" has not come out of nowhere.\n\nHere is my main concern - you've made this decision by yourself that will affect your wife and the choices she has available in her life, you're upset that she isn't as supportive as you want her to be after doing this without giving her any real input, *and you admit you don't even know what her main concern is*.\n\nHave you not asked her? You're mad that she is \"making you choose\", but you haven't given HER any choices on this, except either accept your decision or get divorced. \n\nYou've said you see no point in discussing this with her, because you aren't going to change your mind. You're taking on the responsibility of caring for your mum, and believe me, I know the work involved in doing that. But you aren't doing it by yourself. You've made this commitment for both you AND your wife, and you're essentially giving her no say in it *and* telling her that her opinion on how this is going to work is not worth listening to.\n\nIt is beyond dense (your own description of yourself) to be frustrated at her for being upset that you made this choice about your life together when you won't listen to her.", "My parents\u2019 house was the last stop for my grandmother before she went into care.  My mom was 8th of 11 kids I think (I have trouble keeping them in order).  Before moving in with us, she went through several living situations.  First, she lived in her own home but with one of my cousins (and her baby and boyfriend), which was intended to be a good situation for all involved - my cousin had a new baby and was unemployed, so the agreement was that she\u2019d have room, board, and a stipend (provided mostly by my grandma\u2019s retirement income, but the family supplemented it a bit), but my grandma became abusive to her and threatened the baby.  Crying babies and Alzheimer\u2019s impatience and low frustration tolerance was a bad mix.  My cousin really never gave any hint things were bad until she decided she had to leave, and we were all shocked by the changes in my sweet-natured, gentle grandma.  So then she lived with one of her middle sons (I think he is kid #6/11), but he and his wife were both working and after a couple years, she reached the point where she couldn\u2019t be left alone for a whole workday.  Then she went to another son (#5 I think) whose wife was a stay at home spouse.  That was a good situation\u2026.until my aunt had a series of TIAs (mini strokes) and needed rehab and a temporary carer for herself, and couldn\u2019t continue being her primary caretaker.  The family got lucky on the timing of that shift; it happened the summer before I started law school, and my dad was a middle school teacher, so there were 2 of us who could divide the day with her.  By that point, she couldn\u2019t be left alone at all - she was prone to wandering (and falling) and she\u2019d turn on the stove or the oven and forget she was cooking often.  But at the end of the summer, there was no one in the family able and willing to be a full time caretaker for her, so she had to go into a home.  At least we had 10 weeks to research and find a decent place near my parents.  And she really never was able to adjust/acclimate because of how advanced her condition was by then, which was\u2026.hard.", "As someone who actually looked after my mother for 8 years with dementia until she died, you\u2019re asking a lot of your wife.

Run and hide from you? It\u2019s a painful conversation but it\u2019s one that families have when dementias are diagnosed.

I never allow my mom to take part in our alone time that time is just for us.\n\nI refuse to put her in a Medicaid care facility, so that is a moot point. If I pay for less care that means I will have to make the difference in time, which then even means less time we can spend together. If I put her in a private facility that means I will be spending more money, so that is less money we have to to spend on us which means even fewer fun things.\n\nI personally do feel I have done all I have to be as accommodating as possible.

What struck me is that you mentioned you're on the spectrum, and many of your comments reinforce that you can't see from your wife's perspective, which is understandable. But the issue seems to be you haven't discussed your decisions and seem to have imposed them on your wife. Your argument is that you had made your mind up and that discussion was pointless - but that isn't how your neurotypical wife sees it. Discussion isn't always about changing minds - sometimes it's about talking out feelings and fears. It may not change the outcome, but it is reassurance for your wife that you care about her and the impact on her. \n\nSimilarly, you are very focused on the fact that she's asked you to choose between her and your mother, and that you can understand if she leaves but not why she wants you to choose. Again, for your neurotypical wife, this isn't about making you actually choose - its about you reaffirming your love for her, showing you understand her perspective and are listening to her. \n\nYou're seeing things in quite binary and simplistic ways - you still spend time with your wife, you have all basic needs catered for but you have fewer vacations. What you are not understanding, which makes sense if you're on the spectrum, is that your wife can still feel insecure even if everything is still paid for. Yes, you still spend time with her, but it's less than before and perhaps doesn't feel the same as before - perhaps it's less carefree, perhaps there's more discussions of your mother etc. The point is that talking and discussing these feelings are an opportunity for you to listen to her fears and see if you can reassure her. Dismissing her feelings as childish isn't helpful as it's ignoring the subtext of what she's saying - she is scared, her marriage has changed and her future has changed. You keep saying that she can leave if she wants to - I think she wants to try and talk to you and find a solution that doesn't end the marriage and that's the point she's making by asking you to choose. \n\nIt's really possible this marriage won't survive. But I think your neurodiverse brain means you aren't fully recognising that your wife NEEDS to talk about these issues and have her voice heard and her opinions listened to. If you listen to her and try to ask her about what she wants, rather than telling her your decisions and expecting her to deal with it, you may find this marriage has a chance of survival. But you need to recognise that being entrenched in your position and telling her that this is the situation, like it or lump it, is not effective communication. Ultimately the outcome may not change but marriage is about being a team and solving problems together- its you and her vs the problem, not you vs her. That requires discussion and an acceptance that she has a say in matters that you think only affect you. Try talking, and more importantly, listening and acknowledging her feelings and you may find a way forward. \n\nNAH.", "We are not struggling but let me explain all the ways we are actually struggling????

Or is it because you don't want to come home to a messy house and cook for yourself after taking care of your mother after your wife leaves? \n\nYou said that you are more of a type person who doesn't want kids and your wife is not yet sure whether she wants or not. I think it is because she is afraid that if she ever gets pregnant then she is afraid that you will leave her just because you are so stubborn that you don't even want any kind of compromise like now and care about her.\n\nI have never seen such a stubborn person who wants their way no matter what.", "Wait- OP.

Protecting someone from worrying/feeling bad is something you do for a child, not a partner.

You've said multiple times that you plan to give her whatever care she needs, but have you envisioned what that actually means? At what milestones (which is an awful way of putting it) will mark a change to what care she gets? You're still in a relatively early stage of dementia, yet its already effecting your marriage and life right now. At what point will you accept that what you are able, let alone willing, to care for her stops? Because, unless you're literally willing to give up everything, wife, work, life, everything, she will need to have a higher level of support thsn simple in home care will give her. \n\nAnd, to be a bit manipulative, doesn't it completing waste all your mum's hard work raising you, if you sacrifice your life for her end of life care? I don't believe your mum is likely to want you not to fulfill your own life goals.\n\nIf you wait till your hand is forced to make changes to her care, you may not find the support she needs, at a quality that you'd like, so you do need to think about the future, abojt what point marks where she will need to be in a care facility, and discuss with her doctors or other experts, when the best time for that is to reduce the distress for your mum.\n\nAnd that's without taking into account your own family.

My family collectively chose to care for my grandparent in their own house as much as safely possible. Those who could, took shifts. Those who could not or did not want to (equally valid, caregiving is hard), did not. When I helped care for my parent at the end of their life it was brutal: I woke up about 6am for work, got off at 5pm, cared for my parent until midnight and did it all again the next day.

Instead, you are definitely choosing your mom over your wife and ruining your marriage to 'save' your mother, you aren't married to your mother....well, soon you won't be married at all.  You are letting down your family because your family is your WIFE.", ">we should end it or take a break.\n\nYOu seem really hell bent on your wife ending the marriage so you can blame her for it. \n\nIf you dont like the ultimatum why don you end the marriage", "> Why try to frame it in such a way like you have to choose between one or the other.\n\nYou already made your choice. You just don't want to feel like the asshole for it.\n\nYOU are the reason your marriage is falling apart. Only YOU. \n\nYOU unilaterally choose to siphon > 6k dollars a month to take care of you mother, without consulting your wife, without her approval and without listening to her concerns. This makes you an asshole.\n\nYOU ended this marriage. Her ultimatum is she trying a last time to salvage this. Yet you already made your choice. \n\nYou are not an asshole for taking care of your mother. It's commendable. But don't pretend you are not the one destroying your marriage. Because you are.\n\nAccept that. Tell your wife you want a divorce so you can dedicate yourself to your mom. Accept this responsibility.", "Yes it does sound like you are assuming your knowledge and experience is universal. It isn't. I am sure there are lots of situations others are prepared for that you may not have thought of, but if something bad happened to you I'd call them an asshole for sneering at you for being unprepared.", "Hence NAH. Horrible situation, neither are unreasonable but their needs differ.", ">I do care if she leaves, I do not want her to leave and I do not want to leave her.\n\nYou keep telling her to leave though", "YOU keep telling her to leave. Also everyone is telling you what you are wrong about. Yet you refuse to listen at all.\n\nSecondly YOUR wife is 100% correct and her saying \"This cannot go on and that you need to choose either your mom or her\" Is 100% valid.\n\nIt is valid whether you like it or not.\n\nIt is not that difficult at all. Either choose your mom or your wife. If you choose your mom then give your wife a divorce and let her be free. If you choose your wife well then you know what to do and that is your mom needs to go.\n\nYTA for making a huge unilateral decision on the shared income you and your wife has. Newsflash, you do not have the right to make a unilateral decision with the combined finances without consulting your wife. Also you cannot do that without your wife's approval whether you like it or not.\n\nYes, you are TA, because your wife is not childish nor unreasonable according to any mature criteria:\r  \n\r  \nshe wanted to have an equal discussion with you where the outcome was not predetermined. That isn't childish or unreasonable.\r  \n\r  \nshe has concerns about the future of your marriage. That is something most spouses would treat seriously and not call \"childish\".\r  \n\r  \nshe has not been consulted on financial decisions that affect her too. That is how children are treated, but it does not make her a child to point out how inappropriate that is.", "Gods above us you are so deliberately obtuse. Your reasons for not wanting children make ZERO sense. There is always a chance a child might not be what this world perceives to be normal. You\u2019re scared for the WRONG reasons. \n\nEveryday there is a mass shooting here in the USA and children were some of the casualties. Do you really believe the parents of those poor angels are thinking \u201cwow I shouldn\u2019t have had kids because they might DIE\u201d. People are brought into this world as a risk of so many things but we still LIVE. We still LOVE. There is so many things to be scared of but one should always basque in the moment. A child born with any sort of society based abnormality are still meant to be LOVED. Do you think your mom regrets having you despite the chance of you having early onset Alzheimer\u2019s? No, you asinine toolbar. She gave you life so you can live and thrive. Not to be afraid of any potential dour outcome. \n\nHave kids or not to have kids is a legitimate discussion to be had. But the reasons you gave despite being somewhat legit, that\u2019s a risk even when choosing a partner. And your wife chose you despite knowing you might have early onset Alzheimer\u2019s. And you\u2019re taking her feelings about a legitimate issue and trashing them. You\u2019re the juvenile one. Not her.", "You\u2019re not dense, you\u2019re just not willing to see anyone else\u2019s side but your own. \n\nYou and your wife are a team and the way you talk about just letting her leave if she wants to leave doesn\u2019t make it seem like you love you wife at all.", "Are you still able to contribute your part to the household? Or has that fallen to your wife? If it is impacting her financially then yes, you DID need to discuss and come to an agreement before proceeding. Otherwise it\u2019s just a fundamental difference that you aren\u2019t willing to compromise on. It\u2019s sad but you cannot expect her to give up the prime years of her life to devote to your mother.", "YTA you are choosing to sacrifice your life to care for your mother, you can not ask the same of your wife. This may go on for the next 20 plus years. If she wants children or to spend any time with you she is SOL. Didn\u2019t your mother have any savings? A home with equity? Retirement savings that can be used to hire a caregiver? You are choosing all or none at the expense of your marriage.", "I agree. Except I believe in this case it should be self-wife-mom (with no children in the mix). In this case self can\u2019t live without helping Mom. So there is a huge conflict. But I do feel he\u2019s been relegating wife to the third position and likely Mom to the first.", "He's free to decided about HIS mother. His wife wants her in a care home, he doesn't. No discussion Will solve that. If wife is not okay with that, she should just divorce him.", "Do you have any idea, how her life would be there...?", "Yeah. Don't be selfish OP. Do your wife a favor and just let her go. It seems no amount of talking will make you change your mind or compromise to take your wife into consideration.", "That's actually a common and very good interim solution, as long as the facility is vetted, the patient quality of life won't decrease and might actually increase (enrichment etc)", "You're basically a dictator in your home. You made all the decisions and told your wife to deal with it. She has been, because she obviously loves you, but her quality of life has diminished and she is not willing to spend the rest of her life like this. You're unwilling to have a discussion to reach some sort of a compromise to keep her happy. I understand wanting to care for your mom, but once you're married you also have equal responsibility for the wellbeing of your wife. She's unhappy and you don't seem to care. Therefore, YTA.", "OP, I think you\u2019re in a panic on this.\n\nYou\u2019re scared about your mom, you\u2019ve moved into \u201csurvival mode\u201d with tunnel vision and doing whatever you have to do. When your wife tries to be bring you out of this, you feel like your mom\u2019s life is on the line, and you emotionally react like she\u2019s trying to kill your mother, or get you to kill your mother.\n\nCaregiving can break relationships. This is because because we live in a shitty society and it costs so much in financial and emotional support.\n\nCouple\u2019s therapy may help bring you out of panic mode. It may not save your marriage, but it will bring you out of this traumatized space you\u2019re in. \n\nMy heart breaks for all three of you. Your mom for losing control of her mind, your wife for losing control of her life, and you for trying to one-man the impossible.", "That\u2019s what it\u2019s come to. The discussion is she an ah for doing so? No not really. And he is not an AH for wanting to care for his mother. It\u2019s a shit situation NAH they can go their separate ways.", "But it isn't just vacations. And anybody who's actually experienced something of this calibur knows that. Kindly, you clearly speak from naivety.", "Okay but the problem is is that OPs wife is his family too. Why is her wants/needs being put absolutely last. She\u2019s communicating that what\u2019s currently going on is no longer working for her, and instead of trying to compromise somewhere, OP is digging his heels in. The ultimatum seem to come after she tried to communicate and OP basically said \u201cnah\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not saying OP has to toss his mother aside, but he does have to take his wife into consideration when doing these thing or else HE has no business being married. They\u2019re a team, he doesn\u2019t get to unilaterally make huge decisions like this. \n\nYou\u2019re stuck on the fact that vacations were brought into the story. It\u2019s so much deeper than that. OP is essentially putting his wife and their life on the back burner and telling her to deal with it. Her wants and needs matter just as much as OPs.", "Do you know you get to visit? That patients that have family members checking on them get better care? I speak from experience. \n\nDo you know how it feels when you spouse is either working or taking care of a parent? I also know how this feels. Yes, I help were I can. I don't see my DH from 6:30AM to 7:30PM 4 days a week. The rest of the week he's trying to recoup. It's hard emotionally and physically. It's hard on a spouse to watch.", "My mom lives in a facility that takes Medicaid.  She is very well-cared-for.  She gets fed three hot meals a day, they do her laundry, make sure her hygiene is taken care of, that she's safe and she's visited by medical professionals regularly - from podiatrists to general practitioners to geriatric psychiatrists.  Not all facilities that accept Medicare are bad.", "This YTA because you made unilateral decisions about your mother. You don\u2019t get to do that when you\u2019re married unless you\u2019ve decided you don\u2019t want to be. \n\nYou have chosen you mother as the person you put first above everyone else and that position should be held by your spouse. By doing this you\u2019re telling your wife she\u2019s not worthy of her rightful position everyday. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want a wife, divorce her but don\u2019t string her along in a weak relationship where\u2019s she\u2019s deprioritized and can\u2019t be happy.

You're 100% on it", "It also depends on state, quality of care and funding vastly differ from state to state. NY city medicaid facilities are dog shit. My mother use to work in one and sometimes she would be the only nurse on a floor one person watching 24 beds.", "He respects that. He told multiple times that he understands If she wants a divorce.", "for somebody who seems so aggrieved with your spouse making an ultimatum, you absolutely laid down the first ultimatum. \"This is the way it is, take it or leave it\" is absolutely an ultimatum.", "From your reply, it seems you're not willing to listen at all. What good will it do to your wife if she says her piece but you're not willing to listen because your mind is already made up that you've already thought of all possible solutions and you've unilaterally selected the best choice in your opinion. You seriously shouldn't be married.", "We are in PA.  I was in the situation where I had to tell the hospital I wasn\u2019t coming to get her.  Believe me, I was nervous as hell to see where she was going to end up at the height of COVID.  But she ended up in a fantastic place.  They even helped walk me through the Medicaid application process.  Although I no longer visit my mom (she no longer knows me and gets aggressive), I am constantly in touch with the staff."]}
