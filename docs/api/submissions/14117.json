(Or a little bit Y T A but only for the way you spoke to your wife)\n\nI\u2019m not sure if anyone has talked to you about this, but with Alzheimer\u2019s, it only gets harder for them to adjust to a care home, the longer you wait.  If they go into care while they\u2019re mostly still there, they can still learn that this place and these people are now their home.  They still have the ability to reason that much at least some of the time.  The longer it\u2019s delayed, the less they are able to adjust.  My mom\u2019s family kept my grandma in her children\u2019s homes as long as possible.  When she was finally put into care, every interaction with anyone she recognized involved her begging to go home.  Asking when we were taking her home.  Demanding to know why we weren\u2019t taking her home.  Sometimes meltdowns over \u201cthat place\u201d not being home.  She didn\u2019t have any ability to adjust left at that point.\n\nHaving said that\u2026choosing to be a caretaker is a CHOICE.  You\u2019re not wrong choosing to be her caretaker\u2026but your wife is also not wrong for not choosing the life of a caretaker.  It\u2019s a hard life with a lot of sacrifices.  The fact that you want to make them and she doesn\u2019t is simple incompatibility.  She\u2019s not childish for not wanting to sacrifice her life for your mother, and it was unkind and unjust to call her that.", "Question, did you talk to your wife about this before making the financial decision? \n\nAlso, where is your mom staying? In your home with a care nurse?", "INFO: Can you sustain the expense for the rest of your mother's expected life expectancy? Instead of quantity of time spent making memories, will quality suffice? Are you inadvertently willing to sacrifice your relationship to care for your mother?", "I sympathize with you, but I also work in elder care and understand fully how you\u2019re wrecking your wife\u2019s life. You should accept that she isn\u2019t willing to live this way, potentially for 5-15 years. I\u2019m too sad for all involved to pass judgment.", "NAH I'm very sorry about your situation. The life of a carer is very hard and it's a choice to make. You have all the right to make it and so does your wife. If you want a good life you cannot impose it on her as much as she cannot take you out of it. \n\nSome counselling could help to see if you can find some compromise, but it could end up that you'll be going different ways.", "NAH. I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I would do the same for my mom but I also understand your wives pov. You guys may not be suited anymore.", "Heartbreaking situation.  \n\nI've cared for an elderly parent, and one of the things that is most difficult is the uncertainty.  If your mother had a terminal illness and six months to live, I expect your wife would be on board with giving her all the love, care and attention you possibly could.  But your mother may live another ten years, getting gradually worse, as her personality crumbles away but her body continues to be strong.  Is what you are doing at present truly sustainable?  What if you get burnt out after seven years, at the point where your mother needs even more help?  You are looking at an intederminate but long-term future here.  Be sure you can deal with it, financially, physically and emotionally.\n\nI used to fantasize about murdering my parent.  A clean, quick death and an end to the constant tension, disruption, sleeplessness and fear.  It added to the burden I felt, because nobody wants to be wishing someone dear to them would die.\n\nYour wife has told you she cannot live this way any more.  This is undoubtedly not what she signed up for - she wants a partnership with you, not a situation in which the better part of your attention is elsewhere.\n\nIf you want to keep her, you need to have a re-think about how you are handling the situation.  A long, careful talk with your mother's doctor and/or other medical professionals *who are not personally involved* may be what you need.  Unbiased advice on the best way to care for her.  You are aware of the facts, but you are emotionally involved because she is your mother and you love her\u2014and good for you, being aware of how much she has done for you and wanting to care for her in return.\n\nThere are no good answers here.  But if you want to both care for your mother and keep your wife, something obviously has got to give.  If on the other hand you believe your wife is being unreasonable - which may be true - then the marriage is basically over.\n\nNAH.  Good luck.", "NTA. It's a horrible place to be, but suggesting you let your mother dwindle because \"you should be creating experiences\" is disturbing to me. \n\nI expected to be more sympathetic, but given that her reasoning appears to be larger about this being a big old downer (which it is!), and the fact it wouldn't actually be cheaper to move her, the request sounds like \"spend less time with her.\"\n\nI definitely am sympathetic to her looking down the gun of years of this, but it's still horrendous to ask that. Assuming your wife is a good person, I doubt she's really thought about what she's asking, because it's horrible. \n\nWould couples counselling be an option? This situation is pretty much perfect for it. I have to say, I wouldn't blame her if this was too much for her to stay. If not now, later. But I also couldn't live with myself not doing all I could in your position either.", "What a horrible situation to be in with your mother and I am so sorry her and you are going through that.\n\nNAH\n\nI believe firmly in what you\u2019re saying and agree with all of it. Homes like that won\u2019t make much of a difference while also bleeding much faster. I get your stance on this 100%. She\u2019s, for a lack of a better word, dying slowly in front of you and you\u2019re doing everything in your power to make sure it\u2019s a good experience for her. Did the same with my father when he passed away, the money did not matter and eventually we bounced back financially from that.\n\nBut I also understand where your wife is coming from in this, I don\u2019t agree with it, but I understand. If she is threatening divorce over you taking care of your terminally mother? That is uncalled for and, honestly would be childish. I wish I could give better words in all this, other than I wish you the best of luck and just hang in there.", " Info - this wasn\u2019t out of no where right? Did you discuss and make an agreement with your spouse before you took this, your mothers care,  on?

What would your wife say is the biggest concern right now and how are you working on maintaining y\u2019all\u2019s relationship right now?", "NTA but neither is your wife. You admit in the comments that although you\u2019d discussed caring for her mother, you also ultimately made the decision without really talking to your wife about it.\n\nMy aunt cared for my nana with Alzheimers for 11 years. She wound up having to give up work and was housebound and burnt out by the caring role - not to mention the financial impact. My nana wound up so high needs that getting her into a home was impossible and respite was v limited. You and your wife need to sit down and discuss what this means for you in the short and long term, and it has to be a joint decision.", "NTA. What you do should be totally normal", "NTA, she is being childish. Going into debt or sacrificing true essentials would be a bad choice, but giving up \u201cextra vacations and freedoms\u201d for your mother\u2019s quality of life, especially considering how hard she clearly tried to raise you, is a no brainer. \n\nThe only instance I could imagine of you being TA is if she vastly outearns you and is spending a significant portion of her money on this, but that doesn\u2019t sound like the case.", "NTA - I believe she is being selfish. Her frustration or sadness is understandable, but in the grand scheme of what\u2019s going on, there are more important things to handle. Vacations come and go, you only have one mom, and I think it\u2019s admirable to make sure she\u2019s properly cared for to the best of your ability.\n\nLife deals us a shitty hand sometimes, and as adults we have to roll with it.\n\nFull disclosure - I am a biased sort, I think western culture, in general, treats our old people shamefully. Sticking them in homes, rarely visiting because we\u2019re *so busy* with our lives, treating them as inconveniences to our more important lives. I\u2019m not saying people should devote their entire existence to their care and give up everything long term, but we should be willing to make sacrifices for those that sacrificed for us. \n\nI am very sorry you and your family are going through this.  Alzheimer\u2019s is a rough road. Be kind and compassionate to yourself and each other.", "NTA - you're paying with your own money, not hers. The bills etc are paid, she needs to mourn holidays she cannot pay by herself. So this part is selfish.\n\nBut I understand that she may want to pull out of the caregiver life.", "Nta", "INFO: Who is taking care of your mother when you're working those long hours? If it's your wife, then Y T A. If you're paying for a care taker, then N T A.\n\nEdit: given OP's answers to my question and his other comments, I vote NTA.

Hard to going from nearly no restrictions to having restrictions especially in the case of my wife since while we did split the expenses, my larger income did supplement a larger portion.\n\nThird question, I love my wife, and I also love my mother. I would not be the person I am today without either of them. I was never good with women or anything like that, and my wife is very special person to me and I do not want to lose her, but even still my mother is also a special person and I do feel it is unreasonable to ask someone to choose between important people.", ">Thankfully outside of the Alz she is in wonderful health with no other underline health conditions.\n\nOP's mother could live 20+ years.

As I told my wife, if she wants to divorce or take a break I do understand, no one expects to care for a parent with Alz and I get it. This is not how I expected our lives to go. \n\nI also do agree I do not think she meant what she said either or meant it in the way it came off as. I get she is frustrated, as am I. This is pardon my language a f--ked situation across to be in especially before hitting 30.", "My wife knew I was going to take care of my mother, I just never thought or expected it to become to such a degree at such a young age. As far as discuss I cannot say in good faith I had a fair discussion, as my mind was 100% already made up she is my mom and I am going to do everything I can do give her the best possible life. Just as if it was her family, I would also do the same, it would not even be a discussion it would more so be, well what can we do to help. \n\nIn terms of spending we have always operated on share everything, and since I do make more money and had less expenses I did cover a larger portion of costs related to outings and the like. We do evenly split housing costs though. I had no problem with this since I did not have student loan debt, and I did make more then my wife. As for current spending everything relating my mother's care comes out of mine income, I am also still contributing the same amount to our family saves, and retirement. I have broken one agreement that when we get raises we put the extra income into savings and retirement. Instead currently I am using the extra income to pay for my mother's care. \n\nTo be honest, I am as dense as they come, so I cannot even fathom what her largest concern is, though if I had to guess I would say a large part of it is the loss of time spent together. I also feel the same, and I also acknowledge I need to find a better work like balance cause right now I am pushing myself. I tend to hyper focus and thrust myself into that task in the moment and in consumes me. I do my best to make time for my wife, as an example I do have a trip already planned for her birthday in two months. I know it sucks that at times some of the free time I have left I do spend it with my mom, and I wish I could have my wife be part of it.

It's a marriage, they're supposed to talk about it and figure out how to make it work. It's equally wrong to just make a decision that's a financial strain, a time strain, and an emotional strain (which he did) without consulting and talking to your spouse.\n\nMy parents went through the same thing when my grandma got Alzheimer's. She moved in, we tried taking care of her but she needed 24/7 supervision, doors needed to be locked at all times or she'd wander off, she almost set the house on fire, she got progressively aggressive etc. The setup only lasted several months before she had to be put in a care facility for our and her own good.\nIt was hard on all of us but it needed to be done. \n\nThe same is inevitable for OP. I'm not sure whether he's aware what's ahead, because it won't be manageable if he wants to keep his sanity, marriage and so on.

If what she is doing is wrong, it is no more wrong than what he has already been doing to her.", "If your mind is made up to care for your mother yourself then you need to communicate that with you wife, and underline the fact that there is no room for negotiation here. If no other option for care exists outside your home (eg: no care facilities, not buying a flat and paying for a full-time carer to look after your mum, etc) then your wife needs to have that information so that she can decide if she wants to proceed with the marriage. It's the only fair option to her.\n\nYou are allowed to 100% control the type and level of care your mum receives, but you have to know that there will be consequences for what you choose. If you are unwilling to compromise in any way then you are faced with Sophie's Choice - choose your mum and you eventually lose your wife, choose your wife and submit your mother to the mercy of whatever care provider you select for her. As it stands right now you can't have both, unless you seek a compromise.", "Don't forget, regarding question two, if you guys were planning kids, that might be out of the question with your mom present, considering you've mentioned she's combative. That's a person who might hurt a child, so I wouldn't want to have kids around her, and I doubt your wife would either, if you guys were planning kids.", "We never put a hard yes or no to kids, we were both on the fence. I will admit I am more on the no side of the fence she is still in the middle. To be fair, I would understand if she wants to take a break, leave or what have you. My issue more so comes from the idea that she tried to make me choose, it came off as if she was trying to make this my fault.\n\nIf she is no longer happy with me fine, I get it.

You know it is going to change things even more in the future, right?\n\nIt will possibly (likely) affect your longer term decisions as a couple, including whether you have children, since that is still under discussion.\n\nYour wife has mentioned couples counselling as an option to you, so that suggests this topic has been a concern for a while and probably discussed more than once, so any \"ultimatum\" has not come out of nowhere.\n\nHere is my main concern - you've made this decision by yourself that will affect your wife and the choices she has available in her life, you're upset that she isn't as supportive as you want her to be after doing this without giving her any real input, *and you admit you don't even know what her main concern is*.\n\nHave you not asked her? You're mad that she is \"making you choose\", but you haven't given HER any choices on this, except either accept your decision or get divorced. \n\nYou've said you see no point in discussing this with her, because you aren't going to change your mind. You're taking on the responsibility of caring for your mum, and believe me, I know the work involved in doing that. But you aren't doing it by yourself. You've made this commitment for both you AND your wife, and you're essentially giving her no say in it *and* telling her that her opinion on how this is going to work is not worth listening to.\n\nIt is beyond dense (your own description of yourself) to be frustrated at her for being upset that you made this choice about your life together when you won't listen to her.", "My parents\u2019 house was the last stop for my grandmother before she went into care.  My mom was 8th of 11 kids I think (I have trouble keeping them in order).  Before moving in with us, she went through several living situations.  First, she lived in her own home but with one of my cousins (and her baby and boyfriend), which was intended to be a good situation for all involved - my cousin had a new baby and was unemployed, so the agreement was that she\u2019d have room, board, and a stipend (provided mostly by my grandma\u2019s retirement income, but the family supplemented it a bit), but my grandma became abusive to her and threatened the baby.  Crying babies and Alzheimer\u2019s impatience and low frustration tolerance was a bad mix.  My cousin really never gave any hint things were bad until she decided she had to leave, and we were all shocked by the changes in my sweet-natured, gentle grandma.  So then she lived with one of her middle sons (I think he is kid #6/11), but he and his wife were both working and after a couple years, she reached the point where she couldn\u2019t be left alone for a whole workday.  Then she went to another son (#5 I think) whose wife was a stay at home spouse.  That was a good situation\u2026.until my aunt had a series of TIAs (mini strokes) and needed rehab and a temporary carer for herself, and couldn\u2019t continue being her primary caretaker.  The family got lucky on the timing of that shift; it happened the summer before I started law school, and my dad was a middle school teacher, so there were 2 of us who could divide the day with her.  By that point, she couldn\u2019t be left alone at all - she was prone to wandering (and falling) and she\u2019d turn on the stove or the oven and forget she was cooking often.  But at the end of the summer, there was no one in the family able and willing to be a full time caretaker for her, so she had to go into a home.  At least we had 10 weeks to research and find a decent place near my parents.  And she really never was able to adjust/acclimate because of how advanced her condition was by then, which was\u2026.hard.", "As someone who actually looked after my mother for 8 years with dementia until she died, you\u2019re asking a lot of your wife.

Run and hide from you? It\u2019s a painful conversation but it\u2019s one that families have when dementias are diagnosed.

I never allow my mom to take part in our alone time that time is just for us.\n\nI refuse to put her in a Medicaid care facility, so that is a moot point. If I pay for less care that means I will have to make the difference in time, which then even means less time we can spend together. If I put her in a private facility that means I will be spending more money, so that is less money we have to to spend on us which means even fewer fun things.\n\nI personally do feel I have done all I have to be as accommodating as possible.

What struck me is that you mentioned you're on the spectrum, and many of your comments reinforce that you can't see from your wife's perspective, which is understandable. But the issue seems to be you haven't discussed your decisions and seem to have imposed them on your wife. Your argument is that you had made your mind up and that discussion was pointless - but that isn't how your neurotypical wife sees it. Discussion isn't always about changing minds - sometimes it's about talking out feelings and fears. It may not change the outcome, but it is reassurance for your wife that you care about her and the impact on her. \n\nSimilarly, you are very focused on the fact that she's asked you to choose between her and your mother, and that you can understand if she leaves but not why she wants you to choose. Again, for your neurotypical wife, this isn't about making you actually choose - its about you reaffirming your love for her, showing you understand her perspective and are listening to her. \n\nYou're seeing things in quite binary and simplistic ways - you still spend time with your wife, you have all basic needs catered for but you have fewer vacations. What you are not understanding, which makes sense if you're on the spectrum, is that your wife can still feel insecure even if everything is still paid for. Yes, you still spend time with her, but it's less than before and perhaps doesn't feel the same as before - perhaps it's less carefree, perhaps there's more discussions of your mother etc. The point is that talking and discussing these feelings are an opportunity for you to listen to her fears and see if you can reassure her. Dismissing her feelings as childish isn't helpful as it's ignoring the subtext of what she's saying - she is scared, her marriage has changed and her future has changed. You keep saying that she can leave if she wants to - I think she wants to try and talk to you and find a solution that doesn't end the marriage and that's the point she's making by asking you to choose. \n\nIt's really possible this marriage won't survive. But I think your neurodiverse brain means you aren't fully recognising that your wife NEEDS to talk about these issues and have her voice heard and her opinions listened to. If you listen to her and try to ask her about what she wants, rather than telling her your decisions and expecting her to deal with it, you may find this marriage has a chance of survival. But you need to recognise that being entrenched in your position and telling her that this is the situation, like it or lump it, is not effective communication. Ultimately the outcome may not change but marriage is about being a team and solving problems together- its you and her vs the problem, not you vs her. That requires discussion and an acceptance that she has a say in matters that you think only affect you. Try talking, and more importantly, listening and acknowledging her feelings and you may find a way forward. \n\nNAH.", "We are not struggling but let me explain all the ways we are actually struggling????

I think it is because she is afraid that if she ever gets pregnant then she is afraid that you will leave her just because you are so stubborn that you don't even want any kind of compromise like now and care about her.\n\nI have never seen such a stubborn person who wants their way no matter what.", "Wait- OP. How many hours a week do you work? \n\nThis sounds like a lot of your limited spare time. A normal 9-5 this I would say is an acceptable time to spend away from your spouse but if you\u2019re working overtime on top of long hours as a physician to cover the cost of care that\u2019s a HUGE reason your wife is at the end of her rope. I would figure out a way with her caretakers to set up FaceTime sessions or Skype on a tv to talk to your mom and spend time without needing to be physically present. Shift your focus on being present more with your wife where you can", "So the entire discussion was you saying, \"This is going to be our future, deal with it or get out\"?", ">I did it that way cause I did not want her to worry or feel bad\n\nThis is a very patronizing way to approach things with your partner.  Protecting someone from worrying/feeling bad is something you do for a child, not a partner.  It is treating them as less than your equal.\n\nIt also shuts them out, which is the last thing you want in a situation that strains relationships.  It exacerbates the feeling that you and she are not a team.", "Honey, tell her everything you've written here, *she needs to hear it*.", "You're making it all about you and what you want. That's not marriage. YTA and you'll be lucky she doesn't divorce you fir proving how selfish you are and how little you care for her.", "Op, dementia is a b*tch, but you need to look at the long term play. You've said multiple times that you plan to give her whatever care she needs, but have you envisioned what that actually means? At what milestones (which is an awful way of putting it) will mark a change to what care she gets? You're still in a relatively early stage of dementia, yet its already effecting your marriage and life right now. At what point will you accept that what you are able, let alone willing, to care for her stops? Because, unless you're literally willing to give up everything, wife, work, life, everything, she will need to have a higher level of support thsn simple in home care will give her. \n\nAnd, to be a bit manipulative, doesn't it completing waste all your mum's hard work raising you, if you sacrifice your life for her end of life care? I don't believe your mum is likely to want you not to fulfill your own life goals.\n\nIf you wait till your hand is forced to make changes to her care, you may not find the support she needs, at a quality that you'd like, so you do need to think about the future, abojt what point marks where she will need to be in a care facility, and discuss with her doctors or other experts, when the best time for that is to reduce the distress for your mum.\n\nAnd that's without taking into account your own family. And your wife is your family, she is the one you chose and committed to. Your wife needs to be included in the care plans for your mum, because it is affecting her too.\n\nI'm glad you appear to be listening to others. This is a complex situation, but it isn't a black and white one, you both need to listen and tackle this issue together. She must see some worth in a future with you, otherwise she would have walked already. She wants you to pick her, so please listen to her, choosing her doesn't necessarily removing all care support for mum, it means taking your wife into consideration.\n\nGood luck op. You've got a tough future ahead, I hope you find the love and strength you need, when you need it.", "Agreed. Parents are not owed care but to leave them when they require our help is heartless. Also marriage means sticking by each other in tough times. Not giving up when vacations reduce. However having said that, if the wife wants a particular life, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s ok to think about yourself. It just makes them incompatible", "Exactly this! My partner is the only local child of their surviving parent. We had many conversations before deciding to get married about what that means to my partner and how that will impact our relationship. I had the choice BEFORE tying my life to this person to decide if I was willing to provide this level of care or not. \n\nIf my partner came home and told me \u201cthis is how things are going to be\u201d, I would take that as a clear message that they do not consider me a partner and that my feelings and needs are not important to them. That is a deal breaker for me. Period. \n\nI have been a caregiver. For both a grandparent and parent. My family collectively chose to care for my grandparent in their own house as much as safely possible. Those who could, took shifts. Those who could not or did not want to (equally valid, caregiving is hard), did not. When I helped care for my parent at the end of their life it was brutal: I woke up about 6am for work, got off at 5pm, cared for my parent until midnight and did it all again the next day. I had NO LIFE. And that was only for a short term (1-1.5 months). \n\nOP\u2014-YTA for making a decision that significantly impacts your spouse\u2019s life for the next 20 or so YEARS  without even the courtesy of a frank discussion. You showed that you do not consider your partner an actual partner but also that you tend to believe things are \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d. As your spouse is relatively young, I hope they see you as you ARE and move on with their life.", "Of course she asked you to choose. That\u2019s part of being married. You\u2019re supposed to value her needs, happiness, etc with at least the same passion that you value your mothers. You\u2019ve shown that she is not at equal player in your marriage. \nI get that you\u2019re completely stuck, but the fact that you\u2019re so readily willing to dismiss your wife\u2019s needs for what is possibly decades is sad.", "Sorry, might be just me, but being a single kid to a single mother you always (always :D) are aware that things can happen with your parent, and those things can range from light to debilitating. Especially kids with single mothers. \n\nRegarding, the wife co-living with the mother - OP states that the mother does not live with them and the wife can have 0 contact with his mother if she chooses so, he has no problems with that. So there is no catering and the mother being abusive towards the wife is not currently happening and has a large chance of never happening, cause they are seperated from each other. OP also states (in the comments, I think), that he does not want his mother to go to a facility YET, while she is able to live with a standart carer. \n\nLast, I am not getting the feeling that OP thinks that his wife's thoughts are not relevant or do not matter. (He states that they have had conversations about this.) However, if you are putting an ultimatum on your SO where it is literally you or your SOs mother with Alzheimer instead of trying to be accommodating of more work hours and looking for compromises like a few less vacations during the year... Yeah, I agree - you have no business being married to this person.\n\nAm I saying the husband is a bunny ray of sunshine? Probably could have handled the situation better, we just won't know, cause this is reddit and we never have the full info... :D But kudos to a person, who takes care of their sick mother. :)", "But what choice does he have - leave his mother?... Is she offering to, for example, help with payments so he does not work that many hours and \"waste only his prime\"? \n\nI agree, that it is normal to question the situation. However, it is not normal to make ultimatums like this. Ultimatums like this are for persons, who cannot handle making their own choice of leaving and instead put all of the pressure on the other person.", "Okay, I'm not denying that. What option besides putting the mother in a facility does he have?", "I do appreciate this, after spending the last six hours reading over all the posts it has helped me understand the situation better. I will admit I am still a little confused, but that is where the marriage counseling will come into play. \n\nAll that being said, reason I am more on the no side when it comes to children because I want my kid to be normal, and have a healthy life. I do not want my wife to have to explain social ques to me around other parents. I want to be able to enjoy my time with our kids if we had. Would never want to come too tried to hangout with my kids. My mother has early onset Alzheimer's that is not a good sign either, I do not want to pass that chance on to my kids, or even run the risk I have kids but then I die not even being able to recall the name of my kid. That is why I am on the no side of the fence of kids I am scared. \n\nYou are right though I am dumb, I did not see what she was trying to say, I just focused on the how she said it and not the why. I do care if she leaves, I do not want her to leave and I do not want to leave her. I will not stop her if she leaves, but I understand that was also a mistake reading all of these replies I understand that her giving me a choice was a form of opening up dialog with me. Overall I do agree thank you for helping me understanding.", "So you didn\u2019t even give her a choice you told her how it was going to be. Her only choice was your way or she can leave\u2026. But you think it\u2019s unfair that she asked you to choose her instead? \nTake a step back for a second.", "You are spending all of your time and money on your mother, your wife doesn't get a choice, but you think she's the one who gave the ultimatum? \n\nIf she never sees you why bother being married anyway. That's way bigger than the financial parts.", "He\u2019s made it very clear that her thoughts and feelings had no impact on the matter.  He acknowledged in multiple comments that they never had a discussion of equals about how to handle this - he decided, and he told her.", "He has a choice. Put her in a managed care facility.", "Well he had 2 options that he could have discussed with his wife, rather than making all the decisions unilaterally  affecting their life together. I honestly hope the wife divorces him, because you cannot make these life altering choices and expect the other person to go with it.", "Love that last paragraph-- OP is going hard at justifying but everyone can see this is the biggest problem.", "I see you state here and other places that you don't know what you'd talk about. That your mind is made up. That you've done your best. \n\nHowever a big part of having a talk with someone is actually listening and understanding. It's not about listing facts but hearing their worries, experiences, thoughts and feelings as well as some facts, sure. Listening and understanding are the backbone of communication. This is what the talk would be about. This is a talk that it would be reasonable to have regularly. \n\nYou seem very able to share your plans however you seem to have very little insight into what your wife thinks and feels. This is where you need to focus. Take time, have a talk, have 10 talks but just start trying to listen and understand.", "Have you considered less expensive options than a round-the-clock PCA?  Adult daycares often handle dementia patients, and they\u2019re not doing 1 staff per patient, so that ought to be less expensive.  It may be covered by Medicaid, which would mean cutting your supervision/care costs by as much as a third.", "if you can\u2019t see what there is to talk about, get a marriage counselor! it\u2019s INCREDIBLE what a difference it makes to have someone help with the conversations!!!", "Well if her thoughts are \u201cI want your mom to live in a state funded home right now so I don\u2019t have to give up some of my vacations a year\u201d then her thoughts definitely don\u2019t matter. Seriously that is just cruel. OP is watching their mother slowly slip away in one of the worst way imaginable and their wife is just \u201cWHAT ABOUT MY VACATIONS???\u201d", "What would a talk like that even look like? What would she even able to say?\n\nHow about sitting together, listen to her and find out? You stated, that she is free to say whatever she wants. But honestly it sounds like you don't want to hear it anyway and she can feel that. What's the point talking to someone who doesn't want to listen. \nSo sit her down, explain your thought process and listen to what she has to say, what she feels and thinks about your situation.", "Notice that you say that to *you* this is about money and time at its core?  You\u2019re saying that because you\u2019ve stonewalled your wife so completely that you hardly have a clue why she\u2019s upset.", "At it's core, this is caused by you *refusing to have a conversation with your wife about it*. \n\nYes, your mind was made up but as your wife, you should have wanted her input! You could have made a plan *together*! That's what partners do.\n\nI hope you approach counselling with an attitude of looking inside yourself to see where you are shutting out your wife, and why.", "But it's not just about the costs (but also it is) in the long run. It will take an emotional toll on you and everyone involved. It's mentally draining and all this for probably a decade or longer depending how old and far she is. That's a lot of time and it's understandable if your wife isn't okay to spend years like this. It also is financially draining - you have to spend quite a bit for the right equipment and care that could be spend on a house or other things.", "When you put it that way, I guess you can say that.", "This!  Wish I had an award to give you.\n\nMy husband got one offer in the field that is more a calling than a job for him.  We\u2019d picked the places he applied to together (as my health issues limit where we can live), so we\u2019d already agreed that we were both good living in any of the cities where he put in applications, but once he finished jumping around and cheering, we still sat down together.  The big decision was completely obvious (of course he should take the job), but there were a thousand small decisions to hash out related to the big decision", "You keep telling yourself you didn\u2019t make a choice, but that\u2019s a lie.\n\n\u201dI made the only choice I could live with\u201d could be a more honest version.  And you know what?  It would be totally, 100% okay and acceptable for that to be your response.\n\nBut when you say you didn\u2019t make a choice, you abnegate your responsibility.  You make it something that happened rather than a choice you made. And that?  That\u2019s part of why you keep saying that there is nothing to talk about.  Take ownership of the decisions you made.  Accept responsibility for making the choice.  You can\u2019t have an honest conversation about this with your wife until you\u2019re honest with yourself.\n\nIt also sounds like you are avoiding listening to your wife about her concerns, wants, needs, etc.  You\u2019ve stonewalled her.  It sounds like you\u2019ve done that because you\u2019re overwhelmed and feel cornered, but for her it means she doesn\u2019t get a say in her own life, it\u2019s your way or the highway.  It\u2019s impossible to have a healthy relationship with a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d dynamic.  You\u2019re also projecting your guesses about why she\u2019s upset onto her instead of listening to her, and I\u2019ve gotta say, the way you speak about her seems to indicate a great deal of contempt and very little respect.", "I mean it\u2019s exactly what you did- you said this IS the way it\u2019s going to happen she can get on board or get out. Sounds like she\u2019s done and giving it back to you now and you don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s fine if your mom comes first, but I don\u2019t think you have a right to be personally offended by her giving a last ditch effort before she walks away. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings for sure, but being offended for doing the same thing you did to her? Sounds really hypocritical", "How do you see it any other way?!", "You are again missing the point. It is not about letting her say her piece-- it is about a conversation. Those should not be as one sided as you think. \n\nI hope the marriage counselor can get through to you. If not I hope you eventually realize that the problem isn't your mother, it's 100% you.", "Honey, part of *choosing to be married* is accepting that your partner deserves the opportunity to have an opinion about things that will impact your life. She is your partner. *You chose her*. Why are you acting like her feelings are a burden on you?\n\nYou think there's nothing she could say, but she probably has 100 things she'd like to talk about. You're very stuck on the language that she's using. You need to give her an opportunity to say *what she really means*. Yes, she said the word \"choose,\" but she meant so much more! Talking with her will give her the opportunity to clarify. Her mind doesn't work the way that yours does. Give her a chance.\n\nDo you normally believe that conversations are pointless or only when you want to get what you want? \n\n*Why aren't you fighting for your marriage?* Do you want to be divorced?", "So the entire discussion was you saying, \"This is going to be our future, deal with it or get out\"?", "Tbh, I mentioned in another post I have a very black and white view of the world and situations. In my head all I saw it my mom is sick and I have the means  so I am going to care for her. I often do not think past the one of one needing help or what it  precedent it may set in terns of expectations or feelings. I have gotten a lot of flack for this in the past. \n\nIt probably did not help matters much I also told her if her family needed help I would not even bat an eyelash. I can see how what I said is an ultimatum and also belittles her own feelings. \n\nBest way I can put in my head it is less about if I can help and more so what I am going to do. Which makes having a talk hard because, because it does put my wife in a weird spot which I can see now. I can also see how I framed her in a negative light which was not m y intent. Reading different viewpoints and stuff helps me piece together what I did wrong sometimes it takes a bunch of people telling me the same thing for it to click."]}
