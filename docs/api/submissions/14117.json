(Or a little bit Y T A but only for the way you spoke to your wife)\n\nI\u2019m not sure if anyone has talked to you about this, but with Alzheimer\u2019s, it only gets harder for them to adjust to a care home, the longer you wait.  If they go into care while they\u2019re mostly still there, they can still learn that this place and these people are now their home.  They still have the ability to reason that much at least some of the time.  The longer it\u2019s delayed, the less they are able to adjust.  My mom\u2019s family kept my grandma in her children\u2019s homes as long as possible.  When she was finally put into care, every interaction with anyone she recognized involved her begging to go home.  Asking when we were taking her home.  Demanding to know why we weren\u2019t taking her home.  Sometimes meltdowns over \u201cthat place\u201d not being home.  She didn\u2019t have any ability to adjust left at that point.\n\nHaving said that\u2026choosing to be a caretaker is a CHOICE.  You\u2019re not wrong choosing to be her caretaker\u2026but your wife is also not wrong for not choosing the life of a caretaker.  It\u2019s a hard life with a lot of sacrifices.  The fact that you want to make them and she doesn\u2019t is simple incompatibility.  She\u2019s not childish for not wanting to sacrifice her life for your mother, and it was unkind and unjust to call her that.", "Question, did you talk to your wife about this before making the financial decision? \n\nAlso, where is your mom staying? In your home with a care nurse?", "INFO: Can you sustain the expense for the rest of your mother's expected life expectancy? Instead of quantity of time spent making memories, will quality suffice? Are you inadvertently willing to sacrifice your relationship to care for your mother?", "I sympathize with you, but I also work in elder care and understand fully how you\u2019re wrecking your wife\u2019s life. You should accept that she isn\u2019t willing to live this way, potentially for 5-15 years. I\u2019m too sad for all involved to pass judgment.", "NAH I'm very sorry about your situation. The life of a carer is very hard and it's a choice to make. You have all the right to make it and so does your wife. If you want a good life you cannot impose it on her as much as she cannot take you out of it. \n\nSome counselling could help to see if you can find some compromise, but it could end up that you'll be going different ways.", "NAH. I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I would do the same for my mom but I also understand your wives pov. You guys may not be suited anymore.", "Heartbreaking situation.  \n\nI've cared for an elderly parent, and one of the things that is most difficult is the uncertainty.  If your mother had a terminal illness and six months to live, I expect your wife would be on board with giving her all the love, care and attention you possibly could.  But your mother may live another ten years, getting gradually worse, as her personality crumbles away but her body continues to be strong.  Is what you are doing at present truly sustainable?  What if you get burnt out after seven years, at the point where your mother needs even more help?  You are looking at an intederminate but long-term future here.  Be sure you can deal with it, financially, physically and emotionally.\n\nI used to fantasize about murdering my parent.  A clean, quick death and an end to the constant tension, disruption, sleeplessness and fear.  It added to the burden I felt, because nobody wants to be wishing someone dear to them would die.\n\nYour wife has told you she cannot live this way any more.  This is undoubtedly not what she signed up for - she wants a partnership with you, not a situation in which the better part of your attention is elsewhere.\n\nIf you want to keep her, you need to have a re-think about how you are handling the situation.  A long, careful talk with your mother's doctor and/or other medical professionals *who are not personally involved* may be what you need.  Unbiased advice on the best way to care for her.  You are aware of the facts, but you are emotionally involved because she is your mother and you love her\u2014and good for you, being aware of how much she has done for you and wanting to care for her in return.\n\nThere are no good answers here.  But if you want to both care for your mother and keep your wife, something obviously has got to give.  If on the other hand you believe your wife is being unreasonable - which may be true - then the marriage is basically over.\n\nNAH.  Good luck.", "NTA. It's a horrible place to be, but suggesting you let your mother dwindle because \"you should be creating experiences\" is disturbing to me. \n\nI expected to be more sympathetic, but given that her reasoning appears to be larger about this being a big old downer (which it is!), and the fact it wouldn't actually be cheaper to move her, the request sounds like \"spend less time with her.\"\n\nI definitely am sympathetic to her looking down the gun of years of this, but it's still horrendous to ask that. Assuming your wife is a good person, I doubt she's really thought about what she's asking, because it's horrible. \n\nWould couples counselling be an option? This situation is pretty much perfect for it. I have to say, I wouldn't blame her if this was too much for her to stay. If not now, later. But I also couldn't live with myself not doing all I could in your position either.", "What a horrible situation to be in with your mother and I am so sorry her and you are going through that.\n\nNAH\n\nI believe firmly in what you\u2019re saying and agree with all of it. Homes like that won\u2019t make much of a difference while also bleeding much faster. I get your stance on this 100%. She\u2019s, for a lack of a better word, dying slowly in front of you and you\u2019re doing everything in your power to make sure it\u2019s a good experience for her. Did the same with my father when he passed away, the money did not matter and eventually we bounced back financially from that.\n\nBut I also understand where your wife is coming from in this, I don\u2019t agree with it, but I understand. If she is threatening divorce over you taking care of your terminally mother? That is uncalled for and, honestly would be childish. I wish I could give better words in all this, other than I wish you the best of luck and just hang in there.", " Info - this wasn\u2019t out of no where right? Did you discuss and make an agreement with your spouse before you took this, your mothers care,  on?

What would your wife say is the biggest concern right now and how are you working on maintaining y\u2019all\u2019s relationship right now?", "NTA but neither is your wife. You admit in the comments that although you\u2019d discussed caring for her mother, you also ultimately made the decision without really talking to your wife about it.\n\nMy aunt cared for my nana with Alzheimers for 11 years. She wound up having to give up work and was housebound and burnt out by the caring role - not to mention the financial impact. My nana wound up so high needs that getting her into a home was impossible and respite was v limited. You and your wife need to sit down and discuss what this means for you in the short and long term, and it has to be a joint decision.", "NTA. What you do should be totally normal", "NTA, she is being childish. Going into debt or sacrificing true essentials would be a bad choice, but giving up \u201cextra vacations and freedoms\u201d for your mother\u2019s quality of life, especially considering how hard she clearly tried to raise you, is a no brainer. \n\nThe only instance I could imagine of you being TA is if she vastly outearns you and is spending a significant portion of her money on this, but that doesn\u2019t sound like the case.", "NTA - I believe she is being selfish. Her frustration or sadness is understandable, but in the grand scheme of what\u2019s going on, there are more important things to handle. Vacations come and go, you only have one mom, and I think it\u2019s admirable to make sure she\u2019s properly cared for to the best of your ability.\n\nLife deals us a shitty hand sometimes, and as adults we have to roll with it.\n\nFull disclosure - I am a biased sort, I think western culture, in general, treats our old people shamefully. Sticking them in homes, rarely visiting because we\u2019re *so busy* with our lives, treating them as inconveniences to our more important lives. I\u2019m not saying people should devote their entire existence to their care and give up everything long term, but we should be willing to make sacrifices for those that sacrificed for us. \n\nI am very sorry you and your family are going through this.  Alzheimer\u2019s is a rough road. Be kind and compassionate to yourself and each other.", "NTA - you're paying with your own money, not hers. The bills etc are paid, she needs to mourn holidays she cannot pay by herself. So this part is selfish.\n\nBut I understand that she may want to pull out of the caregiver life.", "Nta", "INFO: Who is taking care of your mother when you're working those long hours? If it's your wife, then Y T A. If you're paying for a care taker, then N T A.\n\nEdit: given OP's answers to my question and his other comments, I vote NTA.

I was going to care for my mother, I did tell her I would not use any of her income or ask her for help with the care of my mother. If she wants to help that is fine, but I would never take money from her since I do understand this is a choice I am making. \n\nMy mother is staying in her home, Medicaid covers 35 hours of PCA service a week and I cover the remaining 133 a week out of my pocket, plus I cover all of her other expenses.

Hard to going from nearly no restrictions to having restrictions especially in the case of my wife since while we did split the expenses, my larger income did supplement a larger portion.\n\nThird question, I love my wife, and I also love my mother. I would not be the person I am today without either of them. I was never good with women or anything like that, and my wife is very special person to me and I do not want to lose her, but even still my mother is also a special person and I do feel it is unreasonable to ask someone to choose between important people.", ">Thankfully outside of the Alz she is in wonderful health with no other underline health conditions.\n\nOP's mother could live 20+ years.

As I told my wife, if she wants to divorce or take a break I do understand, no one expects to care for a parent with Alz and I get it. This is not how I expected our lives to go. \n\nI also do agree I do not think she meant what she said either or meant it in the way it came off as. I get she is frustrated, as am I. This is pardon my language a f--ked situation across to be in especially before hitting 30.", "My wife knew I was going to take care of my mother, I just never thought or expected it to become to such a degree at such a young age. As far as discuss I cannot say in good faith I had a fair discussion, as my mind was 100% already made up she is my mom and I am going to do everything I can do give her the best possible life. Just as if it was her family, I would also do the same, it would not even be a discussion it would more so be, well what can we do to help. \n\nIn terms of spending we have always operated on share everything, and since I do make more money and had less expenses I did cover a larger portion of costs related to outings and the like. We do evenly split housing costs though. I had no problem with this since I did not have student loan debt, and I did make more then my wife. As for current spending everything relating my mother's care comes out of mine income, I am also still contributing the same amount to our family saves, and retirement. I have broken one agreement that when we get raises we put the extra income into savings and retirement. Instead currently I am using the extra income to pay for my mother's care. \n\nTo be honest, I am as dense as they come, so I cannot even fathom what her largest concern is, though if I had to guess I would say a large part of it is the loss of time spent together. I also feel the same, and I also acknowledge I need to find a better work like balance cause right now I am pushing myself. I tend to hyper focus and thrust myself into that task in the moment and in consumes me. I do my best to make time for my wife, as an example I do have a trip already planned for her birthday in two months. I know it sucks that at times some of the free time I have left I do spend it with my mom, and I wish I could have my wife be part of it.

It's a marriage, they're supposed to talk about it and figure out how to make it work. It's equally wrong to just make a decision that's a financial strain, a time strain, and an emotional strain (which he did) without consulting and talking to your spouse.\n\nMy parents went through the same thing when my grandma got Alzheimer's. She moved in, we tried taking care of her but she needed 24/7 supervision, doors needed to be locked at all times or she'd wander off, she almost set the house on fire, she got progressively aggressive etc. The setup only lasted several months before she had to be put in a care facility for our and her own good.\nIt was hard on all of us but it needed to be done. \n\nThe same is inevitable for OP. I'm not sure whether he's aware what's ahead, because it won't be manageable if he wants to keep his sanity, marriage and so on.

If what she is doing is wrong, it is no more wrong than what he has already been doing to her.", "If your mind is made up to care for your mother yourself then you need to communicate that with you wife, and underline the fact that there is no room for negotiation here. If no other option for care exists outside your home (eg: no care facilities, not buying a flat and paying for a full-time carer to look after your mum, etc) then your wife needs to have that information so that she can decide if she wants to proceed with the marriage. It's the only fair option to her.\n\nYou are allowed to 100% control the type and level of care your mum receives, but you have to know that there will be consequences for what you choose. If you are unwilling to compromise in any way then you are faced with Sophie's Choice - choose your mum and you eventually lose your wife, choose your wife and submit your mother to the mercy of whatever care provider you select for her. As it stands right now you can't have both, unless you seek a compromise.", "Don't forget, regarding question two, if you guys were planning kids, that might be out of the question with your mom present, considering you've mentioned she's combative. That's a person who might hurt a child, so I wouldn't want to have kids around her, and I doubt your wife would either, if you guys were planning kids.", "We never put a hard yes or no to kids, we were both on the fence. I will admit I am more on the no side of the fence she is still in the middle. To be fair, I would understand if she wants to take a break, leave or what have you. My issue more so comes from the idea that she tried to make me choose, it came off as if she was trying to make this my fault.\n\nIf she is no longer happy with me fine, I get it.

You know it is going to change things even more in the future, right?\n\nIt will possibly (likely) affect your longer term decisions as a couple, including whether you have children, since that is still under discussion.\n\nYour wife has mentioned couples counselling as an option to you, so that suggests this topic has been a concern for a while and probably discussed more than once, so any \"ultimatum\" has not come out of nowhere.\n\nHere is my main concern - you've made this decision by yourself that will affect your wife and the choices she has available in her life, you're upset that she isn't as supportive as you want her to be after doing this without giving her any real input, *and you admit you don't even know what her main concern is*.\n\nHave you not asked her? You're mad that she is \"making you choose\", but you haven't given HER any choices on this, except either accept your decision or get divorced. \n\nYou've said you see no point in discussing this with her, because you aren't going to change your mind. You're taking on the responsibility of caring for your mum, and believe me, I know the work involved in doing that. But you aren't doing it by yourself. You've made this commitment for both you AND your wife, and you're essentially giving her no say in it *and* telling her that her opinion on how this is going to work is not worth listening to.\n\nIt is beyond dense (your own description of yourself) to be frustrated at her for being upset that you made this choice about your life together when you won't listen to her.", "My parents\u2019 house was the last stop for my grandmother before she went into care.  My mom was 8th of 11 kids I think (I have trouble keeping them in order).  Before moving in with us, she went through several living situations.  First, she lived in her own home but with one of my cousins (and her baby and boyfriend), which was intended to be a good situation for all involved - my cousin had a new baby and was unemployed, so the agreement was that she\u2019d have room, board, and a stipend (provided mostly by my grandma\u2019s retirement income, but the family supplemented it a bit), but my grandma became abusive to her and threatened the baby.  Crying babies and Alzheimer\u2019s impatience and low frustration tolerance was a bad mix.  My cousin really never gave any hint things were bad until she decided she had to leave, and we were all shocked by the changes in my sweet-natured, gentle grandma.  So then she lived with one of her middle sons (I think he is kid #6/11), but he and his wife were both working and after a couple years, she reached the point where she couldn\u2019t be left alone for a whole workday.  Then she went to another son (#5 I think) whose wife was a stay at home spouse.  That was a good situation\u2026.until my aunt had a series of TIAs (mini strokes) and needed rehab and a temporary carer for herself, and couldn\u2019t continue being her primary caretaker.  The family got lucky on the timing of that shift; it happened the summer before I started law school, and my dad was a middle school teacher, so there were 2 of us who could divide the day with her.  By that point, she couldn\u2019t be left alone at all - she was prone to wandering (and falling) and she\u2019d turn on the stove or the oven and forget she was cooking often.  But at the end of the summer, there was no one in the family able and willing to be a full time caretaker for her, so she had to go into a home.  At least we had 10 weeks to research and find a decent place near my parents.

Run and hide from you? It\u2019s a painful conversation but it\u2019s one that families have when dementias are diagnosed.

I never allow my mom to take part in our alone time that time is just for us.\n\nI refuse to put her in a Medicaid care facility, so that is a moot point. If I pay for less care that means I will have to make the difference in time, which then even means less time we can spend together. If I put her in a private facility that means I will be spending more money, so that is less money we have to to spend on us which means even fewer fun things.\n\nI personally do feel I have done all I have to be as accommodating as possible. That is why I feel the whole we need to discuss this as kind of moot, cause I am going to care for my mother and she knew I would care for her.\n\nThe discussion at the core would boil down how much will I spend on my mother's care more or less.", "What else can I do?

That being said, to try and get me to choose between her or my mother just seems to be borderline manipulative. \n\nI do understand if she does not want any part of this, that is fine. I will be sad and heartbroken but I will understand. Part I doubt I will ever understand is the nature of trying to get someone to pick between two important people in their lives.", "I get what you\u2019re doing, but a marriage is a partnership- you need to talk together & figure out if you\u2019re lives are still compatible. It sounds like you\u2019ve made a lot decisions completely on your own- about finances, your time, energy & even love- which would be fine if you weren\u2019t married. Make time to sit & be with your wife- it\u2019s true it might end up with you going separately but it\u2019s also possible to figure out how to manage together."]}
