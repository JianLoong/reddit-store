Keep that backbone shiny!", "NTA Why the hell would you pay insurance for a car you no longer have any access to?

Change the locks, send his calls straight to VM and password protect your utilities and mortgage, so he can't make changes.", "NTA. It sounds like you might have some self-esteem issues. I think you dodged a bullet with the breakup.  He's an adult. Treat him like one. You aren't responsible for his life.", "NTA. Did you call the police when he sold your car? He should have been forced to give you that money (actually a bit more since buying one back needs more money than you get from selling).

Will you go out with me please? :)", "NTA. \n\nYou have no insurable interest in HIS vehicle. You cannot legally insure it. \n\nRegarding the MOT, it's always his responsibility to do this.

Your. Fault.  \n\n\nYou're not his mummy.", "I applied for child maintenece and they contacted him and he has now kicked off over that.

Do not store anything of his. \n\nWhat peace are you protecting? At what cost? Protect yourself. You are worth the investment in yourself.", "NTA.  You're not together anymore.  Why on earth would you pay anything that would benefit him?", "NTA! As a man who also split from his wife when we had a young child, believe me when I tell you that he has brought all of this on himself.

I\u2019m so sorry this has happened to you \u2013 I hope you\u2019re able to get the support you and your kids deserve.", "So far we are better off without him. My older child is more relaxed and the baby is finally sleeping through the night since he left. It isn't that my other child didn't like him.

It\u2019s a roadworthiness certification which has to be done yearly.", "As per the explanation that Eichmil has given. You don't need one for a new car, but once it is three years old, you have to have it tested every year.", "He didn't tell me. He just said he isn't happy and was leaving.

So she he said he was leaving I told him if he wants to leave then I wasn't stopping him.", "In the US that would be the \"Inspection sticker\" which can be tied to the registration.

He broke up with you, so you're not financially responsible for him anymore. \n\n3.

Is he in your will or a beneficiary of any life insurance policies you have?

It's an agreement we have had since I was first diagnosed with my physical and mental health problems. My will leaves everything to my kids so far with my mum and brother as the executor of the will. All this predates our relationship as in this case my mother knew best \ud83e\udd23", "He put it up for sale without me knowing.

My baby is his 4th child and he can't remember any of their birthdays", "Why on EARTH would you handle the MOT on a car he took, leaving you with no car?\n\nYour responsibilities for him ceased when he left, other than to collect your child maintenance check.

Keep records of ANY Contact he has with you.  \n\nPlease stay safe.", "That makes me so sad. Good riddance there. It may seem tough now but I think I\u2019m the long run you will be better off without him. Definitely remove him from anything else- streaming services and other subscriptions that you pay for.

Just listen to her.", "In Tennessee and I've never heard of car inspections until today. I guess that just goes to show how different individual states are", "if you mean the insurance, why would she keep auto insurance when she has  no auto?", "yup. In Texas you MUST have a front license plate. Florida, nope. Every  state has their  thing and I was always trying to get Texas to do away with their front plate law but after working for the state I learned that they are pushed by the Dept of Public Transportation to keep the front plates so it will never be abolished even though there is a push every 2 years to get is removed.", "It may or may not be too late for this, but you should could report the car stolen. If you didn\u2019t authorize the sale in any way then it was stolen property being sold and in most places that could be jail time."]}
