You told him but for whatever reason he wouldn't believe you. Sounds like it's his circus and monkeys not yours. He took the only car you guys owned after selling YOURS. He is being ridiculous here. He ended the relationship, took the car and expects you to keep paying the insurance on a car He took? Umm no", "NTA you shouldn't be paying insurance for car in his possession.\n\nPlus even if he had insurance he would have been stopped because he didn\u2019t have MOT. He only haa himself to blame.", "What did I just read? He sold YOUR car, took the family car, left you with a 6 month old baby,  no money and no means of transportation, and he still has the nerve to blame you about the insurance thing? That you even told him about but he decided not to believe you because... what? it wasn't convenient to him so he pretended it didn't happen? Block this major AH from your life, he's toxic to a degree that can't be fixed or worked around.\n\nNTA obviously", "NTA. He left you in financial difficulty and sold YOUR car. Why would you continue to pay his car insurance? You told him that you'd done this. It's entirely his own fault.", "NTA...why would you pay for something he's using? You even had the courtesy to tell him. Nope, he did this to himself.", "Nta. You notified him, and he failed to deal with it. Is the car in his name or yours?", "NTA. Classic case of fuck around and find out", "NTA\n\nThis is 100% on him.", "NTA.  His car, his responsibility.", "NTA. He wants to drive the car he can pay the insurance. He sounds like a self entitled prick for expecting you to pay.", "NTA thats his problem, an why you should feel guilty because some narcissist took the car. Clearly his fault, don't let him guilt you into thinking it was yours. When he calls whinging, press the hangup button, when he calls back press decline", "He really did a number on you if you think you should keep paying insurance on a car you can't even use because he took it.  He did you a favor when he broke up with you.  You deserve better!!! You deserve a partner who treats you as an equal, not an ATM machine.", "NTA. If he's driving the car he gets to pay the insurance, just like if you've kept the house you'd pay the rent. You told him you weren't paying the insurance it's on him that he didn't take you seriously. Let him sort out the monkeys in his circus", "NTA....screw him", "NTA, you got no responsibility to your ex. Fuck em.", "NTA\n\nNo MOT would have invalidated the insurance anyway.\n\nYou told him you cancelled it meaning it was his responsibility to insure (and MOT) It.\n\nHe sounds like a wet wipe tbh.", "NTA sounds like a him problem", "NTA  - he took the car and you told him you had cancelled the insurance. If he's driving it on the road it's his responsibility to ensure its insured correctly. I presume that the registration documents were in his name also....", "Pay to keep the peace even though it's financially difficult for you and it's not your responsibility? I don't even understand that logic.", "NTA. He owes you!!!", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He sold YOUR car, took the family car (his?) and expected you to sort out roadworthiness and legality of use on his behalf? what a spunk trumpet he is... enjoy your life going forward and forget about him. Definitely NTA, but he's special.", "You have no car but he expects you to pay car insurance.  No way. NTA", "NTA and I hope he gets 9 sweet points on his license, feels like some well-deserved karma. Good luck for the future.", "NTA. Why on earth should you pay for his insurance?", "NTA. It\u2019s his car he should be paying for it.", "NTA Nothing was your responsibility once you broke up. The contract between you is finished. That means the moment you break up you can stop paying any bills for him and being his personal secretary and calendar reminder.", "I have been a mug and paid it for everything because he wouldn't", "See I also feel bad about the mot. That's something I would usually sort out but with a 6 month old to look after it slipped my mind.", "Not just a 6 year old. I have other children who are autistic", "The car is in his name", "I refuse to take calls from him because I know he will get away with verbal abuse. I will only let him message me so I have proof", "Yes he is the registered owner", "He gave no reason why he left that was just what was happening in that moment when we got back into the house. While we where away there were high winds and I hadn't anchored it before we left", "If you aren\u2019t together anymore, why would you still be paying his bills? He left you, let him deal with his own finances.\n\nETA Just saw in one of your comments that you have a 6 month old. He should be paying you money, as in child support, not the other way around.", "How is it your problem that your ex hasn\u2019t changed after he left you? He left you what sounds like an irresponsible controlling asshole - and he\u2019s still that. But now he\u2019s no longer your asshole. You\u2019ve got to figure out a co parent relationship, but that involves him paying child support to your child, not you paying child support to your ex, who is acting like a child.", "Dude left you with a 6mo and no car? Oh boy what an ah", "No, he was - even after he broke up with you - expecting you to do all the mental work. Dude was taking advantage -he's grown and can take care of himself.  You are better off without him. Focus on yourself and your kid.", "He's an adult, he should've checked that everything was in order before driving on public streets. Unless he's incapable of doing so because of disabilities (that probably means he shouldn't drive at all), that's his own negligence.", "You have nothing to feel bad about. Once he ran off with the car he became solely responsible for anything relating to the car. He can't have it both ways.", "You are absolutely not responsible for this. Don\u2019t let him try to put this on you. He\u2019s a grown adult and need to take care of his own business. Sounds like it\u2019s time for you to limit conversations with him to only talking about your child. Everything else is not your concern.", "Get child support started today. Notify whoever you receive any government benefits from of your change in circumstance. Change the bank details to one solely in your name if it isn't already. Make sure he has no access to your bank accounts, change passwords, and change banks if needed. Make sure he doesn't have access to and bill accounts.\n\nDo this today.\n\nTommorow talk to lawyer about a custody agreement. This man has clearly dome a number on you. You need the lawyer to deal with your ex. There will be no fair amicable agreement.", "Not your responsibility then, for neither the insurance or the MoT.\n\nYou have nothing to feel bad about at ALL\n\nNTA", "So it's completely his responsibility, you are 100% NTA in my opinion.", ">he's grown and can take care of himself\n\nThe evidence would suggest otherwise...\n\nOP - definitely not the AH here; if he's broken up with you, then your responsibilities towards him are also ended.", "I did a majority of this the moment he left but thank you for thinking of me \ud83d\ude01 I was giving him a week to sort out a private child support agreement but he didn't so I contacted childmainance and they where calling him within the hour and that caused him to blow up as well", "Good for you.
