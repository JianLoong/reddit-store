You didn\u2019t shoot first.", "Eh, I'd say maybe either NAH or a light YTA.\n\nI had a roommate who was vegetarian.  Even when she offered to pick up things for me from the store, I didn't ask her to pick me up any meat, because I knew it would bother her to do so.  I chose to be considerate.  When she asked me to pick up vegetarian stuff at the store, I would - it did me no harm.\n\nGetting eggs legitimately bothers your roommate: to them, it goes against their personal moral feelings (which they are not forcing you to follow, presumably - like, they wouldn't scream if you yourself bought eggs).  Most likely, getting a beyond meat thing doesn't legitimately bother you, doesn't go against your personal moral feelings.\n\nIt's not really comparable, at least to me. You're mad they wouldn't go against their own feelings in this one particular instance, by doing something they have no obligation to do, which would have made them feel crappy. So in response you're refusing to do something that you also have no obligation to do, but for no good reason really. Just because you want to be mean to them. \n\nSomeone offered you a kindness, said they were unable to fulfill part of your request, and now you're all angry at them, refusing to do a harmless kindness simply to be petty and hurt them.  That's... veering a little close to choosing beggars, man.\n\nI dunno.  If you want to have a decent relationship with your roommate, then I think you're being petty for no point. This person did you *no* harm.  You could just go \"Hey, sorry, I was being kind of a jerk\" and continue on to a good relationship.\n\nOr you could stay all mad and have a shitty relationship with someone you *have to live with*... because you didn't get eggs.\n\nJust like with my roommate, it does you no harm to be considerate of their feelings.", "NTA, he wants to have his cake and eat it. And I'd be willing to bet they wear something or use something that \"involves animal cruelty\" or whatever nonsense he tried to use.\n\nEggs man like that's where he drew the line?

So for there to be balance, you take something away as well, you won't get him whatever fakemeat thing it was.\n\nIf he can't handle that, he's an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nVegans are insufferable, intolerant assholes and it's best to not share living arrangements with them.", "NTA but why would you ask a vegan for animal products? That's not their thing", "I saw something like this in the vegan subreddit, what if its the same situation lol? I think it depends on who you ask but I think NTA.", "NTA. The vegan \"entitlement syndrome\" has gotten completely out of control. My wife's \"best friend\" wouldn't even offer her a traditional option at their wedding. Nope, she has to eat vegan for the day or go hungry.  Cool. Fast forward two years and that same \"best friend\"  had the balls to ask my wife for a vegan option at our wedding. Watching my wife laugh her entitled ass off the phone was fucking priceless. She still came, but she didn't have anything to eat. Funny we don't hear from her much anymore. I guess it isn't any fun when the shoes on the other foot. Tell your roommate to grow a brain. He isn't special, and neither is his diet.", "NTA that is hilarious to me that karma worked that swiftly. If he was well-balanced he would understand", "YTA. While veganism isn't a religion, if the roommate is vegan for moral reasons, asking him to get eggs is like asking a muslim to get pork.
