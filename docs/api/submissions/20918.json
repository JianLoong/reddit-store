I would suggest a clean break for your wellbeing.", "NTA that\u2019s obviously a very unfortunate situation he\u2019s in, but you have to put yourself first. Going to his appointments with him is important and you should do that if he wants you there, still living together isn\u2019t necessary.", "NTA\n\nYou need to worry about your health just as much as he needs to worry about his.

I may seem a little harsh here but do you have proof of this pea-sized tumor that he\u2019s refusing to do anything about or could it be a line he\u2019s throwing you to guilt you into letting him stay? He is your ex for a reason. By all means give him moral\nsupport if he is doing something to help himself but stick to your guns and kick him out. You don\u2019t owe him a mental breakdown.", "NTA - First of all, I call BS on his pea-sized mass. I am betting that he is making that up. Second, if it is real, then he is an idiot for ignoring it.

You have to protect your own mental health first.\n\nIf he\u2019s giving you crap about him moving out then you can serve him a formal eviction and have the police remove him after the deadline passes.

That would've been the first thing I did in that situation.", "NTA", "NTA. He's your ex as of three weeks ago. His problems are no longer your concern.

Magically, he has a growth that he won't follow up on, and so he needs to stay.\nHe's probably lying. If he isn't, he still needs to move NOW, before treatment begins.\nDon't fall for this. He's training you to accept all excuses and lies so he can stay.  Don't be owned because you don't want him to think/call you a heartless bitch.

I'm also looking askance at  the \"pea-sized mass\" story, as I can't believe anybody would refuse follow-up medical care for something affecting the brain.\n\nRelated story that might or might not be applicable: A good friend of mine was married once, but her husband's behavior went way downhill, making baseless accusations against her and causing other issues. They wound up getting a divorce, but she later found out that he had a brain tumor that caused his behavioral issues.", "NTA\n\ntell him he has 3 days and after that the locks will be changed and his stuff will be on the curb", "and i just read more of your story, please get far away from him and don\u2019t have any more contact. \n\nWishing you all the best.", "Exactly.

If he has a mass, could that have caused it? You're still fine for doing what you're doing, but you might let him know that you'd be more open to helping him if he followed up and was treated (unless that would be dishonest--in which case you're still good).", "NTA and have you seen a medical letter confirming this or is it just his word???", "INFO: Did you see proof of the tumor?

This guy sounds super controlling. To the point where it would not surprise me if he was laying about a brain tumor to get her to take back the breakup.", "Wow BIG yikes on this guy. Absolutely kick him out OP!"]}
