He\u2019s very dangerous", "How convenient that the diagnosis completely explains his shitty behaviour. Being the better person is overated. You don't need to continue to support him if he treated you like crap in your relationship. If you feel the need to do something good do some charity for people who actually deserve it.", "There is a book called The Gift of Fear and that gut feeling is valid and should be listened to.", "Think of it this way, if it's true, you leaving gives you immediate space without having to fight. If it's a lie and your worse fears are founded (approaching you when you're separating is crossing is harassment either way) then you want to be somewhere new where he doesn't know your address then block him.\n\nI don't want to give a judgement but in either case it is probably better that you move for your comfort and safety.", "\u2026 what? Checking post/comment history is not stalking at all. It\u2019s right there. You click on their username and bam, history for the world to see. I don\u2019t do it often unless something really doesn\u2019t add up, or unless another commenter mentions it being interesting. But a lot of the time it does add greater context.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s just juicy.\n\nOne time I saw a post by a man who was on r/parenting basically saying that his wife gained a bunch of weight, he doesn\u2019t find her attractive, she barely tolerated him, his eldest son was just downright nasty and the daughter was too young to really have an impact on the story. The son gave the father a gift on his birthday after no one acknowledged him or did anything the whole day, and the gift was something stupid like the sons mostly empty deorodrant can. His wife laughed in his face about it.\n\n At face value, the relationship needed work or was doomed, the son was way out of line, all sorts.\n\nOh boy but look at the post history of the OP? Soliciting young women on Reddit, posting his own nudes and kink pictures, bashing on his wife for \u201cbeing fat\u201d whilst he was \u201ca total stud\u201d or w/e he said in one post.\n\nBasically, he was a cheating ass who felt entitled to every one else\u2019s time and complain and everyone has enough of his crap. His original post painted it as a \u201cyeah we have issues but my family stepped over the line!\u201d \n\nContext is everything, and ESPECIALLY on subs asking for judgement in people\u2019s lives, commenters like to know a bit more backstory before passing judgement.", "Interesting.  I just never knew that.   Not to be an a-hole, but I guess I never cared enough to know all that.  I just came for the snark, aww, laughs and that's enough for me.  I'm a night owl and a huge reader, so I find this fun.  I do see where if I thought someone was really funny or witty or maybe had similar tastes, I could take a peek, just out of curiosity, so thanks for sharing how to do so!", "Eh every now and then someone posts something and I think \u201cthis must be the type of person to also\u2026.\u201d So I check. \n\nIt\u2019s mainly for drama like, okay did this person post this before or leave out information? Just stuff like that. That\u2019s if I\u2019m incredibly bored. \n\nI also love reading those petty little arguments that you have to tap/click \u201ccontinue this thread\u201d six times to see what they still went on about. \n\nJust stupid little shit. Like I\u2019m not trying to find out who anyone is in the real world. \n\nBut no, that is not something I frequently do (look at someone\u2019s post history. I do read the petty arguments six lines over quite frequently)", "It is not uncommon at all.\n\nIf someone's in real trouble, often a younger person (I am also \"mature\"), before replying I will sometimes look at past history to make sure my answer is appropriate. Sometimes I get an entirely different picture from past posts than what I had imagined.\n\nI also might check past posts of an occasional person who posts really interesting things."]}
