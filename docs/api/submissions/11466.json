Who doesn\u2019t even know who i am or what\u2019s going on in this life? Like Op said, his brother is just a body at this point and yeah this might sound cruel but it\u2019s the harsh truth.

Maybe OP should clarify that.", "NTA. Perhaps talk to your Mom about not bringing your brother to the wedding.  You can tell those who question his absence at your wedding as being too difficult/stressful for him to travel.  Then, have a family party at home where you renew your vows and make your brother an integral part of the ceremony.

Its your wedding do what you want.", "NTA - you are the sibling of a severely disabled brother, you seem to have accepted this with grace. Most posts regarding this family situation, the able-bodied sibling is usually not happy at being forced to be a caregiver and/ or being ignored. Yours is different.

Whether you parents want to take him is on them. And they aren\u2019t AHs either if they don\u2019t want to that\u2019s a lot of work. They sound a bit too worried about what others think and so are throwing you under the bus instead of admitting it would be too hard to take him.", "No, you are not.  You may have your wedding however and wherever you wish. You invited him, your parents have made his needs their life work, so be it.    They are obviously ready, willing and able to do what is necessary to see to your brother\u2019s needs, I do not think you are imposing on them in the least.  It is their choice to do this.", "You invited him. If your mom wants him there she can make the arrangements and pay. You should have the wedding you and your fianc\u00e9 want. Congratulations. NTA", "NTA - Your parents would have had to pay for a care assistant for the day of your wedding anyway, unless they planned on spending your wedding day taking care of him. There's always something that someone will criticize about any wedding plan (some criticisms are more valid than others, but there's always something). Have the wedding you want. You aren't being unreasonable or unkind.", "NTA. They've included him in everything and even if they didn't plan to bring him, they'd complain if you didn't invite him. Whatever you did was going to be wrong.\n\nINFO: Does he have  passport?", "NTA. Your parents always included your brother, so you did too. \n\nIt's totally reasonable of them to say, \"It's not feasible to bring Bobby. I'm sure there will be other guests and family who won't be able to make it, too. We're happy for Roofie and their upcoming wedding.\"", "NTA, you can\u2019t center everything around your brother. If your parents want to center their life around him that is on them. You have a right to have your wedding where you would like. You did invite him and now it is up to your parents whether they want to bring him or not.", "NTA. You have given up childhood experiences to go sit with someone who can\u2019t even engage with you, just because your parents wanted you to. Your life has been defined by his existence, and you don\u2019t even seem bitter about it. You sound like a really loving person. I don\u2019t think I would have had it in me to live that life and not be embittered and angry about spending so much time with somebody who didn\u2019t even know I was there. (I\u2019m just guessing that based on your description.) You gave up a lot to make your parents happy and to bond with him in the off-chance that maybe he could.\n\nYou can have the wedding you want. You have a right to that. You invited him, and if he has awareness of that, he will appreciate it. I agree with the suggestions to live stream it for him or get video. I also think you\u2019ve earned this. Have your dream wedding. You\u2019re clearly keeping your brother in mind, and that matters.\n\nI think you sound like a great person and I don\u2019t think I could have accepted that life with anywhere near the grace you have.", "Can I respectfully ask what was the tragic accident that made him that way? Doesn\u2019t matter for purposes here, just curious. So sorry that happened to your family.", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding, and it was nice you invited him. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re in this position.", "NTA. Your family needs to quit thinking about what other people will think. I think it's fine for your mom to tell people, \"We decided not to bring \\*brother\\* who'd be happier staying at the facility\" and leave it at that. What are people going to do? Stick their noses up and say, \"I can't believe they left their disabled child in care and didn't drag him to Jamaica.\"  If they do - then that tells you what kind of people they are. You did the right thing inviting him to be polite. And you and your family don't owe anyone explanations of your choices.  Your mom and dad need to get over worrying about other people's opinions at this point, because it probably will be safer and more comfortable for your brother to stay in care, and for your parents to get away for awhile and not go broke trying to keep up appearances.", "NTA\n\nWell played. If he ends up being excluded, it\u2019s because of your parents and not you.", "Definitely NTA, if there\u2019s any day where you should have more say than anyone it\u2019s your wedding! I honestly don\u2019t blame you at all for the situation and it certainly seems like your parents have kinda made you take on the role of a carer for him.\nDoesn\u2019t make you a bad person for not wanting to take on any of that responsibility on your wedding day.", "NTA - while you may not feel like you love him.  Apparently there's a piece of you that does and respects the relationship he has your parents too.  Sounds like your parents was looking to attend something for you without him being there and getting a small break from him.  (That's not a bad thing either)  I think everyone who knows you and them can understand the situation if they say \"we've talked about traveling with him but at this time it's not feasible for this trip.\" and leave it at that.  Why do they have to explain their finances or choices with other people?", "NTA - absolutely positively not!! You grew up with having your brother included in your life including trips even though no one really knows of he understands. Your parents made this normal for you. So you did what you were brought up to do which is included your brother in events. It\u2019s on your parents wether they bring him or not. The only thing I will say is maybe you should have asked your moms opinion before you invited him.", "I think this is a crappy situation all around. I also think your parents were jerks by trying to put the blame at your feet. \n\nPersonally, I don't think the situation should have even involved finger-pointing. It's a destination wedding in Jamaica, that costs money. To bring a severely disabled person and hire a caregiver is also hugely more expensive on top of things. There's no shame in saying that. And most rational people would sympathize and understand. Only jerks would judge you or your parents. Your parents should realize that by now.\n\nSure it'd be great if he could come but sometimes things don't work out the way you want them to. \n\nHave a beautiful wedding!\n\nNTA", "NTA. And, you need to really understand that, because you are in an position where *someone* is going to claim you are an asshole, no matter *what* you did.\n\nIf you *hadn\u2019t* invited him you would be called an asshole for excluding him. Additionally, excluding him would have sent the message that he was unwelcome, and you would be (and, in fact, were) called an asshole for that.\n\nThis is of your parent\u2019s making. They wanted a close family? Well, you\u2019re close enough that he is welcome at your wedding. That\u2019s closer than a lot. They insist on taking him everywhere they go? That\u2019s their choice. (Does **he** even get a choice?) If that\u2019s the pattern they have set for themselves, it\u2019s up to them to decide what to tell people if they break that pattern. (They also, in that case, should have been planning on taking him to your wedding all along.)\n\nYour mom initially called you out for excluding him. But, by including him, you\u2019ve now put her on the spot to explain to the rest of the family why **they**, not you, are excluding him, if they don\u2019t bring him along. So, in her eyes, you\u2019re an asshole either way. Your mother is not a nice person. You are not responsible for the pattern of expectation she set.\n\nWhat your mother *wanted* was for you to plan your wedding around your brother. That is the *only* thing that you could have done to satisfy her. But, this wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9, not your brother. As long as you are okay with people declining to attend, and don\u2019t push for reasons and whine that they should make it work, the decision of where to hold it is entirely up to the two of you. \n\nIf mom wants to host a reception for you after you get back from your honeymoon, and bring your brother, she should absolutely do that. But, in no way are you an asshole for inviting your brother to your wedding. She can bring him, or not. Either way, it\u2019s *her choice*; both to make, and to explain.", "NTA.

I think if op wants to find a happy middle ground she can do something down the line as a small gathering for those who couldn't make it there.
