Who doesn\u2019t even know who i am or what\u2019s going on in this life? Like Op said, his brother is just a body at this point and yeah this might sound cruel but it\u2019s the harsh truth. They needed therapy to accept that and life with that instead of \u201ewasting\u201c their money and include someone who is \u201edead\u201c.

Maybe OP should clarify that.", "NTA. Perhaps talk to your Mom about not bringing your brother to the wedding.  You can tell those who question his absence at your wedding as being too difficult/stressful for him to travel.  Then, have a family party at home where you renew your vows and make your brother an integral part of the ceremony.

Its your wedding do what you want.", "NTA - you are the sibling of a severely disabled brother, you seem to have accepted this with grace. Most posts regarding this family situation, the able-bodied sibling is usually not happy at being forced to be a caregiver and/ or being ignored. Yours is different.

Whether you parents want to take him is on them. And they aren\u2019t AHs either if they don\u2019t want to that\u2019s a lot of work. They sound a bit too worried about what others think and so are throwing you under the bus instead of admitting it would be too hard to take him.", "No, you are not.  You may have your wedding however and wherever you wish. You invited him, your parents have made his needs their life work, so be it.    They are obviously ready, willing and able to do what is necessary to see to your brother\u2019s needs, I do not think you are imposing on them in the least.  It is their choice to do this.", "You invited him. If your mom wants him there she can make the arrangements and pay. You should have the wedding you and your fianc\u00e9 want. Congratulations. NTA", "NTA - Your parents would have had to pay for a care assistant for the day of your wedding anyway, unless they planned on spending your wedding day taking care of him. There's always something that someone will criticize about any wedding plan (some criticisms are more valid than others, but there's always something). Have the wedding you want. You aren't being unreasonable or unkind.", "NTA. They've included him in everything and even if they didn't plan to bring him, they'd complain if you didn't invite him. Whatever you did was going to be wrong.\n\nINFO: Does he have  passport?", "NTA. Your parents always included your brother, so you did too. \n\nIt's totally reasonable of them to say, \"It's not feasible to bring Bobby. I'm sure there will be other guests and family who won't be able to make it, too. We're happy for Roofie and their upcoming wedding.\"", "NTA, you can\u2019t center everything around your brother. If your parents want to center their life around him that is on them. You have a right to have your wedding where you would like. You did invite him and now it is up to your parents whether they want to bring him or not.", "NTA. You have given up childhood experiences to go sit with someone who can\u2019t even engage with you, just because your parents wanted you to. Your life has been defined by his existence, and you don\u2019t even seem bitter about it. You sound like a really loving person. I don\u2019t think I would have had it in me to live that life and not be embittered and angry about spending so much time with somebody who didn\u2019t even know I was there. (I\u2019m just guessing that based on your description.) You gave up a lot to make your parents happy and to bond with him in the off-chance that maybe he could.\n\nYou can have the wedding you want. You have a right to that. You invited him, and if he has awareness of that, he will appreciate it. I agree with the suggestions to live stream it for him or get video. I also think you\u2019ve earned this. Have your dream wedding. You\u2019re clearly keeping your brother in mind, and that matters.\n\nI think you sound like a great person and I don\u2019t think I could have accepted that life with anywhere near the grace you have.", "Can I respectfully ask what was the tragic accident that made him that way? Doesn\u2019t matter for purposes here, just curious. So sorry that happened to your family.", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding, and it was nice you invited him. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re in this position.", "NTA. Your family needs to quit thinking about what other people will think. I think it's fine for your mom to tell people, \"We decided not to bring \\*brother\\* who'd be happier staying at the facility\" and leave it at that. What are people going to do? Stick their noses up and say, \"I can't believe they left their disabled child in care and didn't drag him to Jamaica.\"  If they do - then that tells you what kind of people they are. You did the right thing inviting him to be polite. And you and your family don't owe anyone explanations of your choices.  Your mom and dad need to get over worrying about other people's opinions at this point, because it probably will be safer and more comfortable for your brother to stay in care, and for your parents to get away for awhile and not go broke trying to keep up appearances.", "NTA\n\nWell played. If he ends up being excluded, it\u2019s because of your parents and not you.", "Definitely NTA, if there\u2019s any day where you should have more say than anyone it\u2019s your wedding! I honestly don\u2019t blame you at all for the situation and it certainly seems like your parents have kinda made you take on the role of a carer for him.\nDoesn\u2019t make you a bad person for not wanting to take on any of that responsibility on your wedding day.", "NTA - while you may not feel like you love him.  Apparently there's a piece of you that does and respects the relationship he has your parents too.  Sounds like your parents was looking to attend something for you without him being there and getting a small break from him.  (That's not a bad thing either)  I think everyone who knows you and them can understand the situation if they say \"we've talked about traveling with him but at this time it's not feasible for this trip.\" and leave it at that.  Why do they have to explain their finances or choices with other people?", "NTA - absolutely positively not!! You grew up with having your brother included in your life including trips even though no one really knows of he understands. Your parents made this normal for you. So you did what you were brought up to do which is included your brother in events. It\u2019s on your parents wether they bring him or not. The only thing I will say is maybe you should have asked your moms opinion before you invited him.", "I think this is a crappy situation all around. I also think your parents were jerks by trying to put the blame at your feet. \n\nPersonally, I don't think the situation should have even involved finger-pointing. It's a destination wedding in Jamaica, that costs money. To bring a severely disabled person and hire a caregiver is also hugely more expensive on top of things. There's no shame in saying that. And most rational people would sympathize and understand. Only jerks would judge you or your parents. Your parents should realize that by now.\n\nSure it'd be great if he could come but sometimes things don't work out the way you want them to. \n\nHave a beautiful wedding!\n\nNTA", "NTA. And, you need to really understand that, because you are in an position where *someone* is going to claim you are an asshole, no matter *what* you did.\n\nIf you *hadn\u2019t* invited him you would be called an asshole for excluding him. Additionally, excluding him would have sent the message that he was unwelcome, and you would be (and, in fact, were) called an asshole for that.\n\nThis is of your parent\u2019s making. They wanted a close family? Well, you\u2019re close enough that he is welcome at your wedding. That\u2019s closer than a lot. They insist on taking him everywhere they go? That\u2019s their choice. (Does **he** even get a choice?) If that\u2019s the pattern they have set for themselves, it\u2019s up to them to decide what to tell people if they break that pattern. (They also, in that case, should have been planning on taking him to your wedding all along.)\n\nYour mom initially called you out for excluding him. But, by including him, you\u2019ve now put her on the spot to explain to the rest of the family why **they**, not you, are excluding him, if they don\u2019t bring him along. So, in her eyes, you\u2019re an asshole either way. Your mother is not a nice person. You are not responsible for the pattern of expectation she set.\n\nWhat your mother *wanted* was for you to plan your wedding around your brother. That is the *only* thing that you could have done to satisfy her. But, this wedding is about you and your fianc\u00e9, not your brother. As long as you are okay with people declining to attend, and don\u2019t push for reasons and whine that they should make it work, the decision of where to hold it is entirely up to the two of you. \n\nIf mom wants to host a reception for you after you get back from your honeymoon, and bring your brother, she should absolutely do that. But, in no way are you an asshole for inviting your brother to your wedding. She can bring him, or not. Either way, it\u2019s *her choice*; both to make, and to explain.", "NTA.

They made sure your childhood centered around him and want your wedding too as well. A wedding near home would make it easier to include him. But it\u2019s YOUR wedding and you DID include your brother. Now it\u2019s on your parents to do their part.

I think if op wants to find a happy middle ground she can do something down the line as a small gathering for those who couldn't make it there.

Whether or not they should then bring him\u2026 only they can know if it\u2019s worthwhile if he really has NO awareness and would really only be there for your parents. \n\nThe only reason this isn\u2019t N A H, because it really is just a tragic situation with no good answers, is that your parents are trying to turn this into making you the bad guy and also them trying to get you to completely change everything about your wedding.", "NTA - didn\u2019t have a destination wedding - I got married in my local town in the UK - but I still posted an invite to my Aunty and Uncle that lives in Australia, even though I knew they couldn\u2019t come due to COVID travel restrictions - it\u2019s really sweet that you still invited your brother :)", "NTA but I am curious, if you\u2019re willing to share, what happened to your brother that made him go from any other kid to being completely incapacitated?", "NTA.  Your mom and dad don't want to let go of the idea that their son is their son, but all he is is a body.  That suck so fucking hard for them. You can't make him be aware.  I'm so sorry.", "NTA", "NTA. Your parents don't get to dictate where you have your wedding, especially if they aren't assisting with it financially. They're putting you in a no-win situation. They're saying you're inconsiderate for inviting him. But from everything you've said about their relationship with him, I imagine they'd have been upset for you excluding him if you hadn't invited him. I get the impression the invite/lack of invite isn't even the real issue here, they're just pissed you're having a destination wedding and didn't have it in town like they wanted.", "They took him to Disneyland. Why are they getting bent out of shape over taking him to destination wedding?", "NTA for inviting your brother.\n\nHowever, I saw that you used the word mauldin. I've never seen it before so I looked it up. It doesn't seem to fit because in the definition it says it means \"self-pitying or tearfully sentimental, especially through drunkenness.\"  It didn't add anything to your post and it was awkward because the sentences around it were just explaining how your parents feel. Anyway,  good luck with this and enjoy your wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou deserve the wedding of your dreams. Your brother's condition shouldn't guilt you into anything less. I don't understand why your parents aren't happy for you. That son will never get married, so why not celebrate their other child's wedding without the drama? What are they even thinking?", "Nope, NTA. It's your day, your wedding you are paying for. If your parents are going to get bent out of shape about it they can stay home. You have your own life to live.", "NTA for this but you are in general", "I don\u2019t understand. You are very vague about your brother\u2019s disability. What does it entail? Can he be in a wheelchair? Why couldn\u2019t he come to your wedding? If your parents want to pay for him to come and pay for a caregiver for the party part why not have him there. Your brother may be disabled and non verbal but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have feelings or can\u2019t enjoy thing. He has limitations, but I am assuming he isn\u2019t in a vegetative state. \n\nThis could be your chance to make a new connection with your brother. Meet him where he is at, read to him. Ask your parents if there were books he enjoyed or what he like to do. Those haven\u2019t changed. \n\nAfter my grandmother had a stroke she was bed ridden and her brain was damaged. She was not the woman she was before, and I understood that. I also knew she liked to look good and always wore makeup. So I did her nails and brushed her hair and helped her put in her signature red lipstick. She loves it and talked about that girl for weeks. \n\nI didn\u2019t do that for my other grandmother when she had Alzheimer\u2019s, and I regret that I wasn\u2019t able to do that for her. \n\nNTA, but I hope you change your mind.", "NTA but I hope you know that just because your brother is seemingly noncommunicative doesn't mean he's not in there. I clearly can't say 100% because I do not know him or his situation, but I work with lots of people whose caretakers have said are just \"husks\", when the reality is they haven't had the supports to figure out a means of communication that works best for them. This includes people who are disabled from birth and from accidents later in life. \n\nI'm sure your brother understands he was invited and he appreciates you thinking about him. I do understand it can be very difficult to bond with someone in that situation, and considering him as a guest at your wedding despite your lack of a connection was a good thing to do. I hope maybe one day your relationship with each other can improve.\n\nETA I should have read your replies to other people before I wrote this, now I feel like an AH. So sorry, I just get passionate about the subject and wasn't trying to shame you in any way. I see more details on his condition now and I have a better understanding of what's happening. Definitely doesn't change my NTA decision.", "NAH. Keep the course, your parents will have to decide if they want to bring him.", "nta.  sounds like you dont mind either way if your brother comes which allows parents to choose whether they will bring him or not.  \n\nThe parents wont be the ah either if they choose to bring him or not.  I cant imagine how much they have had to bear for your brothers condition including expenses.  Im glad they can afford to do so much for him.  Whether he is a shell or prisoner in his own body, Im glad he gets to be present for more than the bare-minimum.  If he does come to the wedding, I hope you have a chance to share a special moment with all of them.\n\nI wish you a lovely wedding.", "My God, yes, YTA.  In fact, that's FAR too lenient to say YTA.", "I think this is a good idea. It seems like it would mean something to the parents and can be done for little cost if it\u2019s scheduled for a time you\u2019re visiting parents anyway. If it\u2019s impractical to wear your actual wedding clothes get a cheat white dress.\n\nFeels like a win/win. Parents can tell people brother is getting this private ceremony, they get to feel he was included, and if he has any awareness left he gets to have the moment.", "Yep, that's what I was thinking. A nice, small, intimate gathering for those who couldn't go. But as someone who's on the verge of eloping - you do you OP, don't feel pressured.\n\nEdit: NTA", "I\u2019m sorry that your parents have put your brother through what they have, and more so that they\u2019ve made you continually sacrifice for and work around a brother that can\u2019t even understand that\u2019s happening. Death with dignity shouldn\u2019t be so taboo. Again, I\u2019m truly sorry. I completely empathize with them and am not trying to sound cruel. I\u2019ve just seen it happen countless times and it\u2019s always so hard on the siblings.", "Great idea!!", "Exactly.", "This is why end of life planning is so important! You need a living will, advanced directive, and a medical power of attorney who is someone you trust to make the right decisions when you can\u2019t.", "Right, so it's a damn if u do, damn if u don't", "Yup!!! Because it isn\u2019t OP\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the parents.", "Jahi McMath. What a sad case that was.", "It's to postpone or temporarily alleviate the grief of the parents :/", "There was no throwing involved. Mom walked in front of the bus then complained it was there.", "Read OP's other comments. They say he had 1/3 of his brain removed.", "Or he could have just discussed it with them before sending invitations.", "Yes, but it's unclear exsactly what they mean. Especially considering the response about the brain dead woman. Basically wasn't a clear question or answer. So now I'm just over all confused.", "There is one option: have a reception closer to home for all the people who can't make it to the destination, which can include the brother but still mom has to decide where brother fits in.", "There is one option: have a reception closer to home for all the people who can't make it to the destination, which can include the brother but still mom has to decide where brother fits in.", "many high support disabled people are aware of their surroundings,", "Agreed. But if the parents don't want them to pass even if they are fully brain dead... Can't really make them in America. Apparently in Britain the state dose have a say in ending care in brain dead situations.", "NAH\nYour brother is not just a body. Talk to the professionals around him, I am sure they can tell you a lot about him.\nI am a professional working with disabled people and NONE of them was ever just a body. This is so hurtful and he doesn't deserve that.\nAnd yes, you are bitter. Which is ok, your childhood was partly taken from you.", "Nta....if you hadnt invited him.your parents would even upset about that. Now, I'm going to tell you something you probably don't hear often but need to. Do not feel guilty about not loving or feeling indifferent towards your brother. What happened to him is tragic and i feel so bad for your parents but really should have let him go. Its cruel to him to keep him alive and its cruel to you and to them. They'll never heal or get past it if his body is still there but he isn't. He's not truly alive, He's a vegetable and always will be and wasn't fair to you to have to miss out on important childhood events because of it. Don't feel guilty or bad if you feel resent either, even if you have never said you do, you've probably felt it at some point and that's ok. You were a child when whatever happened happened. You should not have been expected to devote so much of your time and energy to someone that doesn't even know you're there. So please, don't feel bad,guilty,or like you've done something wrong.", "Nta\n\nThey tried to SET YOU UP as the bad guy and now their friends are making them feel like crap cause they don't want to take him to the destination wedding, they know how stressful it will be but they have money they can hire a carer.", "Nta. I gave birth to a daughter who ended up extreme special needs, and my biggest fear was having another child and them feeling I didn't love them as much because she occupied so much of my time daily. Your family put you in a no-win situation because you could forgo your dream wedding so it's revolved around your siblings' needs or have the wedding you want. Your relatives haven't lived your life, and they haven't had to deal with it, so 100% NTA. You love your sibling, but there is a balance between loving them and sacrificing your wants for them l.", "NTA", "NTA\nit\u2019s you and your partners wedding. Do what the two of you want. To change the location of your wedding just to make your mom happy would be a shame and you\u2019d probably regret it. I respect what you did for putting thought into planning your wedding and inviting him. I also think (maybe this is weird) your brother would want you to be happy and understand your choice. Watch a slide show or video of the wedding with him after. You are not the asshole. It\u2019s your day", "Nta.\n\nParents of the bride and groom have a minor part in the wedding, maybe your mum is trying to increase her audience by having a bigger wedding nearer home?

Your mum has made an issue out of nothing, and I can only see that whichever way round it is, she's trying to make all the attention be on her.", "NTA- Your brother would need a passport and be medically cleared to travel. I think your mom knows that, and he probably doesn't have either. She just wanted to guilt you.  Ask her if she's taken care of those requirements next time she brings it up. Good luck on your beautiful destination wedding.", "If he\u2019s not really aware of anything? Then your parents only have to leave him in the facility while away. And your invitation to him was more a \u201cpro forma\u201d thing than an actual expectation that he\u2019d go. \n\nSo, NTA.", "NTA it's your wedding and you decide if he can go or not", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.   I feel sorry that this happened to you, the entire situation.  It\u2019s tragic that your brother didn\u2019t get the life he should have had, but it\u2019s also incredibly sad that you grew up in his shadow.  Your parents lives revolved around him and the charade of treating him as if he was the same as you, so as not to deprive him of anything you did as a family. They simultaneously ignored the child who could have enjoyed the experiences but who was lost in all their performative parenting of a child who was unable to know what was going on in his own mind, and unable to express an opinion or appreciate their efforts.  \n\nI can only imagine what that felt like to you.  There must have been times when you felt a certain level of despair.  Even if you didn\u2019t resent him or felt bitter towards him it can\u2019t have been easy.  It would have been better for them to do things with each of you that were kind and pleasant for your brother, and some activities that were yours alone to enjoy.  You missed out.  You shouldn\u2019t have to do that anymore. For all of their actions, your brother is a stranger to you.  \n\nNow, this is your wedding, your day, and since you are paying for it as well, you kept it small and decided to make it a destination wedding.  Everyone in your family knows that your brother will not benefit from the experience, and are probably only enquiring about it as they are chatting.  I doubt anyone expects your parents to bring him.  On the day he can be remembered in speeches and prayers, your not being disrespectful of him, just realistic.  NTA", "Why are they TA I\u2019m confused of what they did??", "It wouldn\u2019t have been petty since it sounds like he won\u2019t know anyway. But inviting him wasn\u2019t wrong either. Your mom should have just said they weren\u2019t bringing him. BTW, you\u2019re one of the few people not upset by your childhood in this type of a situation. Most people are very understandably hurt and upset by having to give up everything during their childhood for a disabled sibling. Don\u2019t feel guilty. If anything is actually getting through, you gave hom something to hold onto. If he registers absolutely nothing, then you missed out on the Bridezilla mentality.", "Thank you! :-)", "i don't think any family situation like that can ever be free of manipulation and cloaked resentment and other toxicities of an emotional nature. NTA but i think even manipulative mum should be left off the hook, money does nothing for permanent anguish and everyone involved should be assumed to be damaged by the sorry situation. grab your happiness op, its your day.", "Y T A", "Parents see the wedding as something the brother HAS to attend. \n\nBut to do that, they would have to pay for brother to not only go (and whatever special accomodations may need to be made for that), but for a full time carer as well for the duration. \n\nI\u2019m gonna guess they can\u2019t afford that. \n\nSo the simple solution is to just not go (or maybe even organise to \u201cgo\u201d via zoom or something). \n\nBut no, parents insist the brother HAS to be there, so they\u2019re angry at OP for making this so difficult on them. \n\nI can understand the parents mindset, there\u2019s clearly a lot of guilt over their disabled child, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s at all a healthy mindset.", "This is the perfect answer.", "Wow.
