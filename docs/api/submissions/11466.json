So I mentioned that my brother had been invited and left it at that.  \n\nNow my mom and dad are pissed off at me because people are asking them if they are bringing my brother to the wedding.

This post did not go how I thought it would. I thought perhaps your title was wrong and you didn't invite him. But you did. Your mom should not have tried to shame you for having your wedding the way you want. Now it is on her to either make arrangements for his travel and care or explain to everyone why they aren't doing it.", "NTA. You did literally everything right here - you may not love your brother, but you're not blaming him for his disability. You were polite and made an effort to make him feel included by inviting him. The fact that your parents don't want to pay the extra expenses that come with attending is not your fault, and your mother was definitely TA for trying to make you look bad. You're doing great OP, I hope you have a great wedding!", "NTA\n\nYou are right to give your brother an invitation to the wedding. Your parents could quite easily take him to Jamaica like they took him to Disneyland, So they shouldn't make you take the blame for his non-attendance.", "NTA. \n\nEven though he won't attend by being invited shows that it's not because of you not wanting him there.", "NTA, it's your wedding and you get to do what you want. It's too bad your brother can't go but it's not your fault.  Have a great time, I love Jamaica.", "NTA if your mom hadn't run her mouth this wouldn't have started.", " NTA; awful situation, but you\u2019re trying to make the best of it.  Sounds like your parents were setting you up for a \u2018heads I win, tails you lose\u2019 situation anyway.\n\nHope you have a good wedding and a long and happy marriage (and that your brother gains what joy he can from jt).", "NTA, he's your brother and he hasn't done some horrific thing that would warrant not being invited. also just bc he's non commutative doesn't mean he's unaware", "NTA - you have done as your parents always insisted, and treated your brother as an equal part of your family, even if you don't (can't) have a meaningful relationship with him.\nEven if he will not be able to go, you have done more for him with this simple gesture than a lot of his fellows in the facility get from their families! And you are in no way obligated to pay for or accomodate _anyones_ participation, not him, your parents, siblings or friends. Throwing together a wedding is expensive and stressful enough, don't take it on yourself to feel any \"blame\" for his non-participation. \nCongratulations on your wedding, hope you will have a wonderful celebration!", "NTA. Your mom thought she could publicly shame you and it didn\u2019t go according to plan. That\u2019s on her, not you.", "NTA and I bet if you had an invited him, they would be yelling at you for excluding him. It\u2019s a very difficult situation for everyone, but all your mom has to say to anyone asking is \u201cno, unfortunately it\u2019s too difficult for him to travel at the moment.\u201d", "NTA. You have done the compassionate thing to include your brother with an invitation. \n\nYour mother created the tension by first trying to convince you to modify your wedding plans for their convenience and then by trying to shame you in the family chat. \n\nIt's an unfortunate situation, but not of your creation. Enjoy your wedding with a clear conscience.", "NTA\n\nYou did exactly as you should have. Your parents have tried to give him as much of a \"normal\"  life as they could, perhaps sometimes at the detriment of yours? That includes including him in life events. This is a life event and it's only right for you to plan your wedding as you and your future spouse want it to be and to invite those nearest and dearest to you. \n\nIt is not your fault if he cannot come for whatever reason. You would have gotten so much crap if you hadn't even bothered inviting him", "You are definitely NTA.", "NTA at all and that\u2019s some 4D chess right there. I hope you have a lovely wedding and your parents can go jump in a lake.", "NTA you did nothing wrong. You have the right to have your wedding where you want", "NTA", "NTA - didn\u2019t you do exactly what your parents taught you to do?  You invited him to the wedding.  All the rest is on them.", "You\u2019re not the asshole. I work in APD group homes and it\u2019s sad that a lot of my clients don\u2019t go to these big events that their families have, but they get to see pictures and hear about it. \n\nYou did the right thing by inviting your brother because he deserves to watch you get married as well. He deserves to experience these type of activists regardless of his disability.", "NAH. It\u2019s sad the condition your brother is in, but it is reality and does not need to be treated as taboo. \n\nI would feel differently if he lived with your parents and they could not travel without him, but in this case he can be safe and comfortable in his home.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely appropriate that your parents would want this to be an occasion the whole family can attend too. Those moments a parent can just feel \u201cnormal\u201d are precious, and this unfortunately won\u2019t be one. Whether they hold it in or express it, they will be feeling a sense of loss at the wedding that your brother is not there, so you may want to think about how you can be understanding of that.", "Is there any room for compromise? ie:  when you return, can you and hubby don your wedding clothes and visit brother to take some photos with him?", "NAH.\n\nI agree with such suggestions as to visit him in your wedding attire,  or even set up with his carers to do a \"Live\" so he can watch the wedding on a device.\n\nYou did the right thing in inviting him. Your mom is dead in the wrong to shame you about it", "Good for you inviting your brother, it's a lovely thing and something to share with your family. My only thought though is do you not think at least some of the cost of bringing him should fall on you rather than your parents?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Enjoy your destination wedding!", "I thought about not inviting him. But it seemed petty.", "NTA, this wouldn't have happened if your mother hadn't opened up.", "My husband and I did this for his grandmother who lived in a care facility and it meant so much to her and his parents.", "But why do? His brother is half dead, it\u2019s just his body who is here and not himself. He wouldn\u2019t even know that it\u2019s a wedding or that someone is taking pictures with him.

I accepted it and moved on.", "Why would it?", "She gave up her entire fucking childhood for him. Why the hell is she responsible for paying his way now?\n\nNTA.", "It was kind of you to invite him. No way should you move your wedding that\u2019s crazy.", "The difference is, it sounds like your mother had the mental capacity to appreciate it. It doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s brother does. So, it would just be for OP\u2019s parents. Not saying it\u2019s a reason not to do it, but the circumstances are different.", "The parents would like him to be included. This is really for his parents. The family photos are something for the parents to have with their son and daughter to remember an important family event.", "What an awful way to talk about someone who is disabled", "Yeah, the idea of you helping your parents pay for his trip is silly. They pay for ALL KINDS of similar things for him. And it's not like hosting a wedding is cheap.\n\nI agree with everyone who said you did everything right. NTA. And your mother owes you an apology on the group chat since she implied you were being unkind to a LOT of people.", "I would agree that the situations are different, but I can tell you the response from his parents and his aunts were enough to make it worth it. This would absolutely something that OP and his wife would be doing for his parents.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like the parents wanted to take him to the destination wedding though, they\u2019re feeling pressured now that people know he was invited.", "His parents need actually therapy and should accept the fact that their son is half dead and not there. It really sounds like they neglected OP and gave all their attention to a \u201edead\u201c person. That\u2019s not healthy and completely wrong. It sounds cruel but why would i neglect my other child/children who is/are there, who feels something who is healthy for my son who can\u2019t feel anything? Who doesn\u2019t even know who i am or what\u2019s going on in this life? Like Op said, his brother is just a body at this point and yeah this might sound cruel but it\u2019s the harsh truth. They needed therapy to accept that and life with that instead of \u201ewasting\u201c their money and include someone who is \u201edead\u201c. Might be an unpopular opinion \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It sounds awful but it\u2019s the truth. You should put your feelings aside and accept and realize the basic facts here. He is not there, he is just a body, he IS half dead that\u2019s literally what OP says so yeah i assume that he can\u2019t do anything and that again, his body is just there and nothing else. \n\nYou should start thinking rationally and not bring your feelings into it.", "The problem is for all we know the brother could be aware but unable to communicate it as has been cases with similar patients in vegetative states who later were able to recover. \n\nHe could be dead, or he is stuck in a situation of being a prisoner in his own body. Which then turns this even without feelings into a messy ethical debate", "Yeah it COULD be like that, that\u2019s why i said that i assume that he is \u201edead\u201c. Maybe OP should clarify that."]}
