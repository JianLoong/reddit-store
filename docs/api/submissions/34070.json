Still, I stayed close to the budget.\n\nAbout a week before Christmas, my husband came home with a bag from Target and said not to look because my stocking stuffers were inside. I panicked and said \u201cI thought we weren\u2019t doing stockings\u201d. He had forgotten about that part of the conversation, and said he just bought a few things. So, I went out and got stuff for his stocking. The thing is, I love buying stuff for stockings, it\u2019s my favorite part of Christmas, so I went a little bit overboard and ended up spending about $200 on his stocking.\n\nOn Christmas morning, when we emptied our stockings, he had gotten me just a few things like he said, and felt guilty when I opened mine.

They took that a lot better.\n\nHowever, when my father mentioned to my husband that he got me a really good gift with the CrossFit classes, my husband now feels like I lied because I didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed by his lack of gifts.

Why did you feel the need to talk about CrossFit with your family, after you already talked to them about being broke? And now you've lied to your family and made your husband feel bad. And a little unsolicited financial advice: If you agree to keep it under $50, and you spend more than $250, this is an unsustainable spending style. Look online for some budgeting advice and look at your income and outflow written on a spreadsheet; set a budget based on reality. You may \"love to use it to show love,\" but spending like this when you're broke enough to talk about it with your family is in no way helpful.", "YTA, not because you lied about him getting it for you, but because you spent way more than you and your husband budgeted for when you\u2019re trying to save money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't even have to tell the family about the cross fit classes to begin with. Why do people think they have to tell everybody everything? If you have been telling your family about your financial trouble, then it is no surprise that they would wonder how you can afford it. Keep your business to yourself if you don't want to get feedback.", "If you're having financial issues, how are you not only spending an extra $200 on gifts for your husbands and also a Groupon for CrossFit? I'd be mighty confused if I were your family, too. And it sounds a little like you're addicted to spending. \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nBe honest with yourself: you lied to cover your over-spending. Which is a sign of a problem.\n\nFirst: that you went overboard on his stocking with the excuse that he forgot and bought a few things for you. \n\nSecond: that you went further outside budget and bought something for yourself that you made clear to *everyone* that you do not have the money for. (Thus your family asking about it.)\n\nThird: you then lied to pin the blame on your husband, instead of taking responsibility for your overspending on yourself.\n\nThe whole Christmas agreement/his forgetting/etc is window dressing at best; red herring to distract from the real issue at neutral; or an attempt to shift blame to your husband at worst. And your husband is internalizing it.\n\nYou both need to sit down and commit to a budget. If it takes cutting up cards with your name on it and only giving you your part of the budget in cash or pre-paid credit cards, YOU MUST GET YOURSELF UNDER CONTROL. I\u2019d suggest therapy to work in *why* you have this issue but I suspect that\u2019s not in budget right now either.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "Just tell him that you said that to get yourself out of trouble not because you were ashamed of his gift.\n\nNTA", "YTA for not telling your family to mind their own business.", "NTA. I tell people my husband bought me stuff all the time even though I bought it myself. He gets credit for being awesome and I get my stuff. If your husband is that upset about it, I'd tell him to just go tell the truth if he wants them all in your business. If your family isn't paying your bills, I'm not sure why either of you care what they think anyway. This is a nothingburger and he is being ridiculous. And next time anyone who asked me to explain myself like that would be stuffed with their own pudding.", "yta. get your spending under control and why did you throw your husband under the bus that you where driving", "YTA. You can't afford the $200 in stocking stuffers (how???) and you can't afford CrossFit. I don't get why your parents would be happier about your lie version anyway, because it's still coming out of the same household pot. And if you want to involve your husband in a lie, you have to tell him first so he's not blindsided when your dad brings it up.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA though I think it came from a good place.\n\nBut more importantly you and your husband need to sit down with a financial planner (or someone to help you) and figure out how to stick to a budget. You clearly struggle with budgeting and it\u2019s causing you problems which are likely to get worse unless you get it under control.", "NAH. I do agree that you and your husband should find someone to help y'all budget a bit better, and you *might* have a spending problem (since I don't know how you've worked out your budget I don't know if the CrossFit was already planned for) but definitely not the ahole for saying what you did to get your family off your back. I can see why your husband might interpret it the way he did, but since you genuinely weren't meaning it that way, NAH. Sit down with him now that some time has passed and explain you just wanted your family off your back about the CrossFit and you knew if you said it was a gift they leave it alone", "> Why did you feel the need to talk about CrossFit with your family\n\nWell, we all know CrossFit is the opposite of Fight Club. The first rule of CrossFit is that you must always talk about CrossFit!", "Also OP is YTA for not telling their family to mind their business \n\nUnless the family have loaned their money, they have no reason to comment on how it's spent\n\nGenerally shouldn't be lying to family or husband!", "This should be the top comment. OP went over budget on a stocking ($200 over budget in a stocking??). Then after OP spent the first paragraph detailing how tight their budget is she then says she purchased a Groupon for CrossFit classes for herself (there are so many videos/free plans online to do CrossFit at home or outdoors so this seems unnecessary for someone trying to save money). \nAnd then when talking about it with her family she lies to cover up her own spending and says it was her husband.\n\nThis all sounds like someone unable to control their own spending. \n\nYTA", "> We moved to a new city, and both ended up taking lower paying jobs than usual, and have had a hard time budgeting with our new salaries\n\nI agree with your post and contextually it doesn't seem that husband is struggling to budget at all. If so, this is likely more deflecting.", ">The first rule of CrossFit is that you must always talk about CrossFit!\n\nYep! It's like keto. OP is whinging to his family about being broke and then telling them about his CrossFit trial. Treat it like Fight Club, dammit!"]}
