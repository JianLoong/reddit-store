You just blatantly ignored her and then told her to fuck off.\n\nIt isn't her place to call you childish, but ignoring someone talking to you *is* kind of childish. Use your words like an adult.\n\nIt is rude to ignore people when they are visiting. Here are a couple of different ways you could have handled the situation:\n\n1. Say hello then politely excuse yourself and go to a different space.\n2. Say hello, briefly engage with her conversation, then change the subject. When she says \"not everything is about you\" you can directly confront her about her behavior. \n3. Say hello then immediately bring up how you have been feeling about your interactions with her \"Actually, I was hoping to talk to you about something else. In our conversations we spend a lot of time talking about things that you are interested in, but when I try to talk about my interests you ignore me. Would it be possible to have a more even split in what we talk about, or to try to find subjects that are interesting to both of us?\"", "You can tell her you are sorry for cursing but that you would rather she not pester you in the future, and NO you will not babysit.", "YTA It is understandable that you don't want to talk to her only about herself.

Just shut down the conversation with one or two word replies. Go to another room. I would set some clear boundaries on babysitting and just say politely, \u201cthat\u2019s not going to happen. That because in younger, I\u2019ll be free labor isn\u2019t appealing for me\u201d.", "So, she likes hearing herself talk and nobody else is allowed to speak?\n\nNTA, she sounds like a narcissistic begging for attention.", "Nta.
