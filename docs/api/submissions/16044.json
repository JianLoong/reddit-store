Also my family has never really been big on birthdays, unless they are big numbers like 18,21,30,40,50 (ect).\n\nAnyways comes to the night before my birthday and my mom(45F) comes up to em and says \u201cyou didn\u2019t want anything for your Birthday right?\u201d I was confused cause I had already said a couple things that I wanted/needed. So she noticed I look confused and was like \u201cwell did you want toys or clothes?\u201d (She knows I\u2019m not a kid and she also knows I hate when people buy clothes for me, so stupid to even ask that) I say no but said I would like to have Burger King for dinner, immediately she turns down the idea because she doesn\u2019t want it. So oh well, not a big deal I can live with whatever it is she wants. \n\nComes the day and I offered to work all day considering it was a public holiday and I wasn\u2019t doing anything else. This pissed my mom off for some reason (don\u2019t know why) so she was salty with me up until I left for work. Once I got home I was looking for my brother (20M) as he said he was gonna come, turns out mom told him not to bother as I was gonna be at work all day. That upset me a bit as we don\u2019t see each other as often as we used to and it\u2019s always fun to just talk. Anyways everyone else wants to go to bed as it was around 830 so there was me, my mom, dad (48M) and one of moms friends (F29) standing around the table as mom brings out the cake. The cake is caramel flavoured. I\u2019m not a picky eater at all but there are a few things in which I despise and just can\u2019t seem to like, one of them being caramel. So they sing and mom is handing out the cake asking who wants a piece and as she hands one to me I politely decline saying how I don\u2019t like caramel. Wrong this to say apparently cause she goes off. Saying how nothing is ever good enough for me and that I\u2019m an AH for not even trying it and what not. \n\nSo I\u2019m thinking was I the AH?
