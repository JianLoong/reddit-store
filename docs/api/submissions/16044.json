(And happy birthday! \ud83c\udf89)", "Op is male, but I don't think she is even considering him at all.", "Agree. It sounds like she was trying to punish him for wanting gifts, for wanting BK, for working. AND she wanted to give herself an excuse to get pissed off even more and \u201cjustify\u201d to herself her idea that OP is an ingrate", "Tell Mom you are learning so much from her. When s birthday of hers is up for celebration, you will know exactly how to celebrate it based on her approach to yours.", "NTA. You told her what you wanted, and she said no because she didn't want that and then got you something you don't like and didn't want and then was mad when you politely declined.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re 16. If you hate caramel that much your parents should be aware of that by now. Also they should have just asked you what flavor you wanted because that\u2019s the norm. Don\u2019t let your dad off the hook here. From what you wrote it looks like he wasn\u2019t a direct part of the problem but he enabled it by not stepping in. Especially regarding your gift (or lack thereof).\n\nAlso happy birthday!!\n\nEdit for typos", "NTA,\n\nHappy Birthday OP, not sure of your geographical location, but if you are able to set up an amazon wishlist (they can be anonymized) and throw in a BK or some other gift card in there. It would be cool to get you a burger or some other non-caramel or apparel related stuff :)", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, happy belated birthday!!!\n\nI think the thing that really saddens me here is that your mom doesn\u2019t seem to know you. Know you as in your taste, the things you like and don\u2019t like.\nThen she gets frustrated when her attempt at doing something good for you backfires. \nHer heart seems to be in the right place but she didn\u2019t make the effort to find out what you actually wanted.\n\nHopefully, you\u2019ll have another opportunity to celebrate your birthday.", "NTA, but there is def some family dynamic back and forth passive aggressive salt  \n\n\n\"She knows I\u2019m not a kid and she also knows I hate when people buy clothes for me, so stupid to even ask that\" (grow up)\n\n\\-and-\n\n\"This pissed my mom off for some reason (don\u2019t know why) so she was salty with me up until I left for work. Once I got home I was looking for my brother (20M) as he said he was gonna come, turns out mom told him not to bother as I was gonna be at work all day.  That upset me a bit as we don\u2019t see each other as often as we used to and it\u2019s always fun to just talk.\" (You said you were working all day and she told your brother you were working all day. K...)", "NTA.  You would think your mom would know your preferenc.  She made your day about her sorry to say.  BTW. Happy Birthda!", "> your mom doesn't know what kind of flavor cake you like\n\nGetting the 1 flavour he hates shows that his mom knows exactly what he likes.", "I\u2019m so sorry. Some people have no business being parents. You deserve better.", "OP you're being super nice, but on your birthday, it's OK to have the cake you want. It's your day. \n\nThe way your mom treats you is not normal. She completely disregarded your birthday and anything you wanted and made it all about herself. She sucks dude.", "Blows my mind that your mother did that. Perhaps she\u2019s too distracted by\u2026whatever\u2026to remember your likes and dislikes. That\u2019s perhaps understandable. But if that\u2019s the case, she could at least freaking ask you what you wanted for your BIRTHDAY cake! I\u2019m sorry this happened, and NTA.", "Here: [PDF version](https://www.ernstchan.xyz/b/src/1570719797-658.pdf)", "Well. If you were mine, I'd have saved for the last 6 months to save up to give you that big day. And that would and did go for both my son and daughter.... Mom's should go out of their way to make you feel special... As I'm reminded of that all the time by her. I chose to have her, she didn't choose to have me.", "This is pretty textbook manipulative behaviour.  She stirs the pot so she can get angry and blow of steam because she can\u2019t/won\u2019t self-regulate her emotions. She uses other people to do that for her. \n\nIn this case, OP is the scapegoat; the reason everything goes \u2018wrong\u2019. So OP\u2019s mom can be \u2018righteously angry\u2019 with him for causing problems and rid herself of any negative feelings she can\u2019t/won\u2019t cope with. So she does consider him but as an object to be manipulated so she can get her needs met."]}
