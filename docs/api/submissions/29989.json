He lost part of his hand and foot, not life threatening, but basketball ending. This happened last year and my son has been in a deep depression that we're desperately trying to bring him out of, but he feels like his entire identity got ripped away in the blink of an eye. He's been in counseling and prescribed medication but it has not helped thus far.

I told him the important thing is that he's with us, but he can bring that up with his doctor next visit.\n\nFast forward about 2 weeks.\n\nI'm upstairs looking for something in my room and I heard my daughter talking to her friends on her phone about college. The conversation turned towards her brother and she said she \"can't wait to be gone, I'm tired hearing (her brother) cry every day\" and saying his hand is gross I knew \"spirits\" in the house has shifted since he became injured, but I didn't think she felt this type of way.

I told her she should be ashamed of how she's talking about her brother and he might do something permanent if he heard you talking about him like that.\n\nWhen my wife got home, we talked about what happened and while she's proud of the way I stood up for my son, she thinks it's too far to also not pay for her college, since we could easily do so.\n\nWIBTA if I don't pay for my daughter's college?\n\nEdit: Fairly unanimous that this would be too far and I think I knew that, but I just can't calm down. Maybe I'm stunned that it was my own daughter saying it, but it's rare that I harbor something like this.\n\nAlso, many comments hinting that I'm alienating or neglecting my daughter are completely unfounded. The post was about my son's condition, so I talked about my son.

Your son had a life-changing event a year ago and you've understandably been focused on him and helping him get through it. Siblings of a child with a serious injury or illness often feel left out or marginalised while the parents spend more time with that child. Your daughter is only 17, and what happened to your son will have had a huge impact on her as well, if only due to the change in the family dynamic.\n\nYou punished her already. Now try talking to her about how she's feeling about things. You might be surprised at what she says, if she's willing to open up (she may not be). But taking away a college education is a step WAY too far.", "ESH. That's not the move dude. A 17 year old being an asshole (granted, a big one) should not go from 0 to tons of debt or no college. Especially if the expectation is set that you're paying, so she hasn't been saving like she would if she knew it would be on her.\n\nShe also said these things in private. I've been in her shoes, sort of. Had a family member go through a major medical event when I was young and it does affect you too. Sounds like she hasn't had a good avenue to work through her own feelings so it's coming out in a shitty way.", "I agree with your wife. Your daughter needs to have empathy but I don't think making this unilateral decision out of anger is the way to go about it. Seems like she needs some therapy as well", "YTA. So you found your dream son, and your daughter had to take a back seat to your amazing new \"son.\"  He's the golden boy, and she's just a girl.\n\nWas what she said okay? No. Was she unkind and resentful? Yes.  The fact that you WANT to destroy her life because she was unkind to your precious son  shows her very clearly exactly who you are and how little you value her.\n\nWhat was she doing during all the hours you spent coaching and mentoring your shiny new son? Who was mentoring her? Who was listening to her struggles? Who was laughing and joking with her while you were bonding with your new best buddy?\n\nEven your wife values your daughter far more than you do.  Why not just drop ger off at the nearest bus station and be done.  That way, she can't interfere with your precious boy.", "YTA You need to figure out why your daughter is so resentful and mean-spirited. Not paying for college makes no sense. How is that reasonable or even logical as a punishment? Family therapy is likely in order.", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t at least help pay for schooling. (Sorry for the long answer but this one kinda struck a chord) \n\nIt\u2019s very likely that your daughter is feeling jealous / left out / forgotten bc of all the attention your son is getting. I\u2019m NOT saying you should stop paying attention to him, because what he went through is terrible and I really hope he feels better \u2764\ufe0f I have been in similar spots myself and I can say that depression is not fun to deal with, for anyone. I\u2019m really glad that you\u2019re being so supportive of him.\n\nI\u2019m not a therapist lol but I do have similar experience it seems to your daughter - I think that since you and your stepson were able to bond SO WELL over basketball and because it became so important, it maybe created some distance between you and your daughter. I could 100% be wrong, but I think what started as small issues snowballed. Teenagers are notoriously bad at dealing with emotions, and she probably doesn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nSo yeah, YWBTA if you suddenly announced you wouldn\u2019t pay for her schooling. Instead, I may suggest spending more time with her and talking in a non-judgemental space. I wish the best for you and the whole fam", "YTA. Your daughter shouldn\u2019t have made fun of him obviously but she\u2019s only 17. Frankly, it\u2019s his own fault he got hurt so if he can be forgiven for doing something stupid then so should she.", "Dude, 17 year old girls talking to their friends are trying on personas. She doesn\u2019t fully know who she is yet, and eavesdropping on conversations with her peers is going to give you a skewed view. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to deal with a family member getting maimed, and to be around but powerless while that person mourns their complete and healthy body.  What she said was heartbreaking and heartless, yes, but it isn\u2019t all of who she is.", "YTA. It's a heavy-handed response that isn't going to help anybody.\n\nI would try to think of some other consequence, or at least make it a partial reduction in financial help, because flatly refusing to pay for any of college just hurts her future and will cause her to resent your son further.\n\nThe accident affected her too, and she would likely benefit from therapy - she could be either lacking empathy, or be protecting herself in an unproductive way.", "YTA but I\u2019m tempted to let it slide because she is far worse. I don\u2019t think step siblings are required to treat each other like siblings but they should at least not be assholes to each other. Good for you despite yea sort of being the asshole since she is 17 and doesn\u2019t have much time to figure out how to pay for school now.", "YTA.\n\nNormal and healthy for teenagers to complain about things to their friends.", "YTA. Now that you\u2019re taking absolutely everything away from your daughter, for what was terrible behaviour but still not a life-ending mistake: what future do you see your relationship having? \n\nDo you even care about having a relationship with your daughter ever again? Are you going to be happy seeing her struggle, to not go to college or to be crushed under debt when she\u2019s done, and feel for years or decades that this is what she deserves for having once been an ignorant teenager?\n\nWhy don\u2019t you just kick her out as soon as she turns 18 and drop all contact? It sounds like you want to throw her away.\n\nYou should never punish in anger.", "Sorry to hear about your daughters serious lack of empathy. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for instilling consequences. Perhaps theirs another way to address this. Because of her disgusting behavior and immaturity I would say she can attend community college while she matures and could then possibly take her associates to larger school for her bachelors when she\u2019s mature enough for it. As of right now I wouldn\u2019t trust her not to be an evil, judgy little monster. Actions have consequences. Withholding an education is a tough one to justify though.", "Your initial punishment was fine. Taking away her college fund is too far. Sometimes, teenagers do not think before they speak.", "YWBTA to refuse to pay her tuition at this point.\n\nShe\u2019s been of the belief that her tuition will be paid for a while, so she hasn\u2019t had the time to save or anything. Your daughter DEFINITELY deserves a punishment for acting that way. Her brother is suffering a lot and mocking him for it is NOT okay. But taking away her ability to pay for her education, which is the key to her future, is not a punishment that fits the offense.\n\nYou need to garner some empathy in her. Taking her tuition will not do that. Maybe you can make her do some volunteer hours to help disabled people or something, idk. She shouldn\u2019t get away scot-free, but taking her tuition is not the punishment she needs.", "YWBTA.  Taking away college funding for a first offence is way over the top.  Ground her , take away her electronics and give her a warning that a second offence could see you paying for her college tuition and books but not living expenses.\n\nA third offence could see you only paying part of her tuition.  And ffs get everyone into counselling/therapy.", "YTA. Most likely you and your wife have, since the accident, ignored or treated your healthy, uninjured daughter as an afterthought. That all too often happens in cases like this. You all need family therapy. She is suffering too, she has lost the brother she knew, and she deserves some TLC as well.", "YTA.\nYou were eavesdropping on your trenage daughters conversation who quite obviously feels pushed asode because you A bonded so much with your son  over basketball and B now the attention being on your son again for being injured out of stupidity and being depressed over the only thing he liked - which is in itself awful but no reason your daughter should be invosinle to you unless she says something wrong and vents to her friends because she geels unseen. This happens often, siblings of sich or disabled children often turn into glass children, all the attention gets focused on the in your case injured child, the whole family suffers under the depression of one member but only the deprrssed child gets therapy and gets basically pampered to make them feel better. Your daughter is jealous you all turn your attention to your son and probably already was jealous over her dad bonding more with his step son than his dead wifes daughter.\n\nTalk to your daughter, offer her to go to therapy, spend timr with her and bond over something she likes like you bonded with your son. If she can't wait to get away from the situation at home then you are the one in the wrong and should try to do better because currently she doesn't want to live with you guys because she feels unimportant and you not being intetested in her and her problems", "YTA stop referring to him as her brother when he\u2019s not. Do you also refer to your wife as her mom?", "NTA as long as you pay for part if it.  He no longer can get a scholarship so part of the college fund should go to him if and when he wants it.  Part of her learning the hard way will be that she will now have debt from college and maybe she should not have made fun of someone who suffered an injury.  Motorcyclist here - for the love of the two wheeled beasts, please stop letting others try a bike without any classes unless it\u2019s a tiny one on dirt.  So many people wreck them the first time they get on.  I don\u2019t even trust experienced riders on mine.", "YTA. You daughter is immature and sucks, sure. \n\nConfiscate her electronics, ground her, finda suitable punishment.\n\nCompromising her whole future is NOT a suitable punishment.", "YWBTA. Taking college away is too far.\n\nShe's 17 years old. Her brain is not fully formed. The last part to form is responsible for impulse control. \n\nGo ahead and threaten her maybe. Tell her college is on the line. But this is a first time offense. \n\nAlso. Therapy for everybody. I know everybody says it but therapy is gooooood.", "YWBTA. You\u2019re upset and considering making the emotional choice of trying to hurt her as much as she hurt you. Doing that would be setting the example for her that when she\u2019s hurt she should hurt others\u2026a never ending cycle of cruelty. She won\u2019t learn the empathy you seem to want her to have that way. \n\nI think when you\u2019re calm it\u2019s worth having a discussion with her about why you\u2019re upset and hurt, find out what compelled her to feel that way, and if you feel she still deserves a \u201cpunishment\u201d consider having her do some community service like volunteering at a hospital.", "You really have to ask? YWBTA. Not necessarily for the money, even, but for dumping the weight of your step sons injury, recovery, and depression onto your daughter. Your fear that your stepson may do something permanent isn't necessarily unfounded, but that's not your daughters issue to handle.\n\nOF COURSE she doesn't want to hear him cry daily. No one wants to hear someone cry all the time. That's natural. She can't fix the issue, so bailing is also a reasonable thing to want. Her step-sibling isn't her responsibility to rebuild. Her laughing about his new ED is cruel, but she's 17.... of course she's going to laugh at ANYONE she finds that out about. I think the overwhelming majority of 17 y.o.s would do the same. It's an issue you only grow to have an understand of, or sympathy for, with age, first or 2nd hand experience, or an education that covers the how and why. A 17 y.o. thinks \"that's something that happens to 90 year Olds and losers\" not \"oh wow, his new meds must be really screwing him up.\"\n\nYou encouraged your stepson to have no identity outside of basketball. Probably some form of living your dreams of being good at it, but I digress. He's old enough he should have had other interests and things instead of \"Me son. Me play basketball.\" single mindedness. His identity crisis is 75%+ *your making.* You should really be doing what you can to get his mind off of his new reality instead of making every action around your house revolve around it.\n\nIt might be worth looking into a trauma counselor for the whole family. A major thing like that rarely *only* traumatizes the person it happened to. It creates wounds for the people around them too. Maybe you all just need to process.", "YTA it's too far. As others have said, she's still young. She's still old enough to know better, shouldn't have said those things and I'd be extremely disappointed in her too but another punishment would be more appropriate. I'd have a long gentle discussion with her. I wouldn't be surprised if your stepson has heard her saying these things before or maybe knows by the way she's treating him. \n\nI'm surprised there wasn't a reallocation of funds (definitely not as a punishment) since brother won't be receiving any basketball scholarships though. I'm sorry you're going through this. I'll be thinking of your son \u2763\ufe0f", ">he might do something permanent if he heard you talking about him like that\n\nI understand your anger, and she was definitely being cruel, but it was shitty to put this on her.", "YWBTA\n\nIf you don't pay for her college.\n\nYes she was rude about him to her friends but your reaction is disproportionate.\n\nedited", "Friendly FYI: A widow is a woman. A widower is a man.", "NTA, but mostly because you financially can't afford to send her without loans on her/your part.  Just let her know you won't be able to cover everything, that she'll be expected to take loans and to repay (informal agreement) loans that you may need to pay.  \n\nThat was the agreement I had with my parents because while on the FAFSA at that time, it looked like they should have saved something but it didn't take into account my father's business going under several years before and that my parents still had 4 kids at home.  I had the federal maximum loans under my name and another $20k my parents needed to take out to cover the parent contribution, which I repaid them for.", "Do you actually want a relationship with your child in the future?", "YTA\n\nThis is not a proportionate response. Your son did something very dumb, and unfortunately he's dealing with lifelong consequences from that. But his actions are also having immediate and lifelong consequences for your daughter. She's lost a lot of your attention during an important transitional point in her life (preparing for college, completing high school) and she may now start her life with a lot more debt because college funds are now likely to be split. Your daughter needs to work on empathy, but so do you - you seem to have no clue the extent to which your son's actions are impacting your daughter.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCollege is not a requirement in life and student loan exist and scholarships exist.", "YTA\n\nWhat she did was bad, but taking away college is a punishment too far. Grounded, no phone, car, and TV for a while is fair.", "YTA for outing your son\u2019s boner problem to the whole world.  I hope at least some of the details were changed, as anyone who knows him would instantly recognize him from this post.", "YWBA, your daughter is wrong..good for standing up for your son. That sounds like a very difficult time. But, a stupid conversation with a friend shouldn't have an impact on your child's entire life. I would try to talk to her to find out why she felt that that was okay to say..what made her feel this insensitive. Maybe she is missing attention from you, as a parent, ever since the accident happened....", "I get it that you\u2019re mourning the loss of your son\u2019s originally planned future. But don\u2019t take away your daughter\u2019s for a few careless words. \n\nIt honestly sounds like you took her making fun of his erectile function way too personally, which either makes me think you\u2019re way too invested in your golden child\u2019s genitals or you\u2019ve got some worries in that department and it felt emasculating to you to hear your daughter laughing about it. \n\nI don\u2019t think it was an appropriate joke\u2026 but some people deal with grief with dark humour. Maybe that was part of her thing. She could be very angry that her dad ignored her in favour of a son who could play basketball, or angry that someone risked not only their own life but that of others by operating a deadly machine that they had no idea how to ride around other people. Either of those things could lead to schadenfreude around his accident. \n\nAnyway, you were over the top and it\u2019s gross that you didn\u2019t let her know you were eavesdropping sooner.", "YTA. Take some time out to think about everything. Your daughter was an AH, for sure, but she\u2019s a teenager and teenagers can be horrible.

Clearly disproportionate reaction to what she said to her friend. I am amused that what ENRAGED you was that she mentioned her step brother can't get it up. Such a typical reaction from a man! Nothing is worse than being impotent, right? You clearly are closer to your ex-jock step son than your actual daughter and that is why she resents him. Your step son (who ruined his own life by being reckless) has his mom and you in his corner, your daughter has no one. You are an awful father to her.", "NTA \n\nToo many people making excuses for a person who\u2019s old enough to know not to be this shitty about other people, much less their family. \n\nNow is the time to be hard with the consequences so that this doesn\u2019t become a permanent part of who she is.

She may be feeling a certain way about all of the attention your stepson gets. She might not fully understand the big picture of his depression and / or how serious it is. She does need to understand these things. She also needs to understand that she has to be respectful and not gossip about his private information. She might be frustrated with the situation as well and was venting to a friend but what she said specifically was not okay.

Even if he was not guilty of any mistake, he probably cannot stop replaying the event in in his mind and wondering about 'what if?'. He needs therapy and support, not just pills.

It's about your daughter's treatment of your son and your reaction to that. \n\nRegarding the situation you are actually posting about, you could have cut the second and third paragraphs down to 'My son was a tremendous athlete in basketball, so when my son was getting scholarship offers for basketball, I realized we could pay for my daughter's college in full and neither of them would have any student loan debt when they graduate. A plan that I shared with my daughter, which I think was a mistake to begin with. These plans changed when my son tried riding on someone else's motorcycle and got badly injured in a ensuing crash. He lost part of his hand and foot, not life-threatening, but basketball ending. This happened last year. He has since been suffering from depression and experiencing side effects from medication', and nothing would have changed a bit. That extra focus on your son, that you even acknowledge, is showing everyone here the golden child situation that's been going on, likely since you started coaching him.\n\nWhat's your daughter planning on studying, by the way? Can you name any of her extracurricular interests? Do you know the name of a single one of her friends? Favourite TV shows and films? How often do you do things with her, just her, not both your kids, and how often did you before your son's accident?", "YTA, On several fronts you have failed the daughter. First, she is not \"Divison I\" level good and so doesn't have a father for her coach. Secondly, the son recklessly injures himself and sucks all the oxygen out of the room with his need for help. The ignored daughter doesn't even have that luxury as her private phone conversations are listened to in such a way that the clueless father decides to take the rest of the daughter's freedom away. Do better for your daughter as she deserves some scintilla of POSITIVE attention and it isn't listening in on her private conversations. You seem to be involved at least vicariously with your step son but haven't engaged at all with your biological daughter.", "Would you want your mom or dad hear your conversation with you and your buddies when you were 17?", "I suggest you take a deeper look at why you are so upset. \n\nYour response is way out of proportion to what your daughter was saying.

Life is unfair. Over time your son will heal. He has a loving and supportive family.\n\nI just hope that your daughter has one as well.", "Good update Dad. That's what this forum can help with.   \n\n\nNow the important thing is to concentrate on healing. Healing your son is a priority, but so is healing the family. Yes, punishment of your daughter for her thoughtlessness is both valid and should be followed through on until she can come to a better frame of mind. Family therapy is important, but also one-on-one time with her, as my guess is that because of her step-brother's injuries she feels neglected and of less importance.   \n\n\nThe other thing to do is of course to help your son. Here is where I can help - I was in a literally life-threatening car accident. I spent 2 weeks in a coma, three months in and out of hospitals, and overall about two years before the last of the dozen plus surgeries were done. Along with a list of minor things I had spinal surgery, and lost parts of my foot and had to have my ankle fused. During my hospitalization I kept being warned that I might not walk again, or might have lifelong pain, and might lose my foot, and so on. I was kept alive on pain meds, serious dosages of morphine and the various opiods (Hydrocodone, Oxycontin, Percocet, etc.). So on top of the rest I had to worry about becoming addicted.   \n\n\nWith all of the things I was trying to recover from and worrying about, I kept focusing on the fact that I was lucky. I survived the accident, as your son did. I was injured, but still had another hand and leg, I had my eyesight, and the list goes on.  So I focused on my recovery, my therapy was always more than just sessions of PT and OT. To me therapy was getting to do something I hadn't done since the accident, from being able to walk again on crutches, then to using a boot. Then as I recovered and the pain subsided to cut back on the pain meds, from 40mg of Morphine plus a dozen opiod pills daily, to less, to just the pills, to just as needed for peak pain, etc. All the while I focused on how lucky I am. I had spinal surgery and can stand on my own. I can walk, ride a bike, I'm not in constant pain. But I also can't do some things - I cannot run; I can't lift as much as I once could. Walking takes more effort than it did, and I get tired and am in pain if I overdo it. Despite that I still feel that I am lucky.   \n\n\nI get it that to your son the life he expected right now, being a college hoops athlete, that is gone. But that sports dream had a limited shelf-life so that he had to face the end of the \"Glory Days\" now or in a few years. Since you know basketball, you know that the number of collegiate players who go on to play professional sports is small, and the number who last more than a year or two at that level is even smaller. That accident stole a few years of athletic achievement from him. The focus now should be on what's next. What does he want to study and then do with his life going forward? Get him talking about that, and maybe that can help move his mind past what he can't do to considering what he can do.", "I have 2 sons, neither of them are athletes but the older one has multiple special needs.  They are both adults now.  My younger son was in a serious accident and also lost part of his foot. He had other very serious injuries so he was in the hospital for quite a while, and then took several months to rehab.  I can relate to the part that while my younger son was in the hospital and recovering, my older son who has normally had more of the family\u2019s focus started to complain that we weren\u2019t paying as much attention to him.  He didn\u2019t specifically make negative comments about his brother though.  My younger son also went through a period where he was depressed as he was worried about his future.  He was able to rehab well enough to return to his job.\n\nI think you and your daughter need to work through this together.  Going through this type of traumatic accident as a family is hard on everyone, and some counseling may be called for.  Your daughter\u2019s reaction might be because she\u2019s having a hard time dealing with what happened to her brother.  Her comments were mean and cruel, and there does need to lesson in empathy for your daughter.  It\u2019s also important that your daughter knows that you still love and value her the same as your son.", "The more I read OPs replies the more I dislike him and the sorrier I feel for daughter. I honestly hope she cuts off this sorry excuse of a parent and saves herself a lot of worry and heartache. YTA", "To start with, I get why you're upset. I think we all hope that our kids will always be compassionate to others. \n\nKeep in mind that from the POV of your minor daughter, she was venting with friends about  her adult stepbrother, and her dad eavesdropped on her private conversation and went nuclear in the stepbrother's defense.\n\nWhen I was a 17 year old girl, I did not see 19 year old boys as my peers.  I saw them in a completely different stage of life from myself, with all kinds of privileges I didn't have yet. To you, they're both your kids and two years age difference probably doesn't feel like that much; you probably feel your daughter was kicking your stepson while he's down.  But your daughter probably doesn't see it that way at all.  \n\nEvery teenage friend I've ever had who had a brother would vent about them sometimes, make fun of them, and/or speculate about their private lives.  It's not ideal, but it is a very normal teen behavior.  Teens' empathy also isn't fully developed and they tend to see things in black and white.  I don't know if they had an antagonistic relationship before the accident, but if they did, that would add to the reasons why she probably sees this situation from a completely different outlook than you do. \n\nI highly doubt she's as familiar with the details of his wellbeing as you are, so she likely doesn't understand as well as you do how hard of a time he is having, either, making joking around or oversharing about his condition seem more appropriate to her from that angle as well.\n\nWhile this can absolutely be a teaching moment for your daughter about where the lines are in talking/joking about your relatives, or even the importance of ensuring she can't be overheard if what she's venting about could be hurtful, it's also important that she knows you value her as well as her stepbrother and care for her wellbeing.  Would you be this protective if the roles were reversed?  If so, she needs to know that.  It sounds like she's frustrated with her stepbrother, and if she feels he's more cared for by her own parent than she is, that frustration will only deepen.", "Taking away college is not the natural consequence of her actions. Making her do some volunteer work for a said # of hours for those less fortunate and having her understand and gain sympathy for people in bad circumstances would be a natural consequence.

But when she combined denigrating his physical deficits, including his manhood with the typical immature venting, she crossed the line and her father was right to burst in and put a stop to it and take everything away. A calmer conversation could be had a day or two later about compassion and human decency. As far as college goes, op needs to qualify WHY there may not be any money for her anymore due to the onset of unexpected and long-term expenses surrounding this tragedy and when it happens to one family member, it happens to all.", "Teens are dumb and cruel sometimes. Probably should have paid more attention to fine-tuning her moral compass, but you were too busy because you had finally got a boy who was also good at basketball, your favorite game. Sad your daughter isn't good at it, but she is just a girl, am I right?\nShe'll grow out of her mean streak, that's for sure, but you will forever be the asshole for screwing her future up over a conversation that wasn't even meant for you to hear. She can't confide in you, after all", "Anyone saying that he's the asshole is nuts.", "YWBTA.\n\nSure, punish her. She deserves it. Your poor son has gone through a life-shattering, traumatic accident and that's bullshit for her to make fun of him. But condemning your daughter to literally *decades* of student loan debt because she was talking shit with her friends is not a suitable punishment for the crime. Shit-talking is what 17 year olds do, and teenage girls are some of the most brutal and ruthless humans alive. That doesn't make it okay by any stretch, but she was probably just saying this stuff because she's trying to be cool in front of her friends and trying to brush off the impact this has had on *her* life. Once again, it's pretty horrible what she said, but not \"$100,000 of debt\" horrible.\n\nBut I would find a suitable punishment for her -- perhaps making her volunteer somewhere to expose her to more people who have suffered injuries that have altered their lives -- and make it *very* clear that if you get wind of any other talk of this that the consequences will be dire. Once, you use it as a teaching lesson. If you hear it again, you drop the ax and perhaps make her pay for her own college then because at that point it shows a blatant disrespect towards you, a complete lack of empathy towards him, and an unwillingness to be a kind, compassionate human.\n\nSide note, and I wish I could have told this to your son before that accident; Every. Single. Person. *Every one of them* that I know who rides or rode for any significant amount of time has dumped their bike at least once and I know several who have had significant injuries including one friend who died while riding at age 21.

Her private conversations should not be up for examination and punishment when you don\u2019t like the content. That\u2019s just crappy parenting behavior. It\u2019s the same as reading her diary and punishing her for what you read! Even if a parent feels justified in these situations, it\u2019s a violation of trust. This is how you wind up with kids who never communicate with you about anything real or important. \n\nSo, the appropriate reaction to this was not to punish\u2014 it should have been to find out what was driving that talk in the first place.

I wanted to be supportive, but the energy was more than I could bear. What your daughter said was cruel and I get the dear of suicide, but she's not experiencing this as a parent, she's experiencing it as a teen who had something terrible happen and a lot of people don't realise how long the terrible feelings last for, for everyone close.

Not that I'm saying she was right in what she said, how she said it, or in her attitude at all, but I think you're right in that part of it could be jealousy based, even if it's subconscious. The 'spirit' has shifted, sure, but her dad's showing a lot of favoritism towards her step brother and then he just storms in there on a private conversation that she was having, not directed at her brother or her father, and reacts as if she just spat in both their faces and kicked them in the junk. \n\nDad is super over reacting and he needs to maybe go to therapy himself and help him figure out how to empathize with his son and daughter in healthier ways that don't cause emotional overreactions towards someone who's still a legal minor saying something where she didn't think he'd hear it.

We can\u2019t control how we feel most of the time, but we can find acceptable ways to deal with those feelings.

I'm sure this father would rather find an outcome where his daughter and son can both come home for Thanksgiving at the same time, rather than alternatives such as where she goes no contact or his son commits the unthinkable, or many other possible negative outcomes.
