His mom, MIL, was initially sympathetic but when AP got pregnant, she moved to their country to be closer to her grandchild. He and AP later got married and had another baby.\n\nIt did felt like a betrayal at the time from Zoe's POV, she lost her dad as well as her grandma. She would visit her dad on some school breaks and part of summer and see her grandma there, and we'd keep in contact via FaceTime, but it wasn't the same. However, by that point I was marrying my 2nd husband whose family adores Zoe so that softened the blow. We also moved to a different state.\n\nMy ex passed away in 2021, which was devastating for all of us. Initially MIL stayed on to support her young grandsons and my ex's poor grieving wife. But without my ex there, there are some immigration/visa issues, so she's \"choosing\" to move back to the US.\n\nShe called me and said that she had decided to move to our state to be closer to Zoe [now 12]. She has no other connections here. I said we'll be happy to invite you to bdays and maybe get together for Christmas Eve, but that our family is busy these days and Zoe is about to enter her teenage years so she should take that into account. She started talking about wanting to spend a lot more 1:1 time with my daughter. I said frankly she'd lost the right to demand 1:1 access years ago and she should bear in mind that Zoe was ambivalent at best about her and with her entering her teen years that prob wasn't going to change. MIL said she was grieving and this was her late son's old daughter and her blood. I said she had all but abandoned Zoe just as her son had, and she couldn't expect to just pick up where she\u2019d left off and that Zoe now had step-grandparents who played a part in her life that MIL had effectively left vacant. I said she could move where she wanted, that was her choice, but don't count on this relationship.\n\nShe was very upset and accused me of trying to erase her Zoe\u2019s father and paternal family to make room for her stepfather/stepfamily, and has said that I\u2019m alienating her Zoe against her. For example, she's upset that I told Zoe in passing that she was having visa issues months ago, because it interferes with her \"I'm coming back just for you\" narrative. And the truth is that I've always made sure Zoe is nice/civil but even before my ex died, I haven't done much to encourage Zoe to deepen the relationship with her grandma. It was hard for her to visit her dad and see MIL being her half-siblings' grandma. She also has complex feelings toward her half-siblings and stepmom. She knows MIL is moving back but I didn't tell her that MIL wants to move here yet. As a parent I don't know if it would be healthy for her, especially since I don't think MIL can be trusted to stick around if she gets a better offer. But maybe it wasn't my place to tell her not to move.", "created_utc": 1684866532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pwjct/aita_for_telling_my_grieving_exmil_not_to_move/", "score": 573, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For the first year he barely saw her but then the next few years she went there on some school breaks and a month in the summer. When her school went remote in 2020, I let her finish out the school year there even.

Never happy where she is or who she\u2019s with in life. In my case she followed my aunt and cousins around the country. She lived in the next town over seeing us regularly until I was about 10. After that I would usually get birthday cards, and occasionally birthday calls (usually on the wrong day because my bday is Aug 25 and my cousin, one she followed, is Sept 22 so she would usually call me on Aug 22 smh) but those stopped probably around the time I turned 18. She didn\u2019t come to either college graduation even tho I was promised she was coming to my graduate degree graduation. What she DID do was call me after that graduation and had the audacity to tell me a relationship went both ways. Lmfao. Tell that to 12 year old me. Anyways I\u2019m 33 now and because of life I\u2019m currently living with my mom and said grandma (my mom\u2019s relationship with her is also very complicated. Always came second to her sister). She\u2019s lived with us for 2 years almost now and I have absolutely zero emotional connection to her even now. She talks to my cousins and aunt for HOURS daily. Literally every single day throughout the entire day she\u2019s rotating through the 3 of them. I\u2019ve never had and honestly at this point don\u2019t even want that kind of relationship with her. She\u2019s just someone who happens to share dna with me. \n\nAnyways. It can be complicated to have a grandparent like this. Maybe talk to your daughter and see what see wants? Maybe get her to a counselor to help process those types of emotions as they come up? I think those may have helped me when I was younger. I also didn\u2019t have a good relationship with my other grandma, she severed the relationship with me when I was 13 and she wrote me a scathing 3 page hand written letter that absolutely tore me as a person to shreds for a perceived slight.

I can even understand wanting to move to a new place after her loss, maybe a start over for a fresh start away from memories of him and choosing a place because at least some kind of family is there. But she can't just expect your daughter and her to go back to the way things were. \n\nYou tell them you're interested and would like to try and reconnect and have it be on their terms. You start over from introductions.", "You didn't tell her not to move, you just tried to make sure she is taking all the relevant information into account when she makes her choice. It doesn't sound like you plan to forbid Zoe from seeing her or anything, just that you're warning her Zoe may not choose to focus on that relationship even if she lives nearby.\n\nIf she decides to move near to you anyway--which if she doesn't have any particular connection to any other state seems very possible--you'll likely have a number of battles ahead of you. But you sound ready to set clear boundaries and stick to them!\n\nIf she does move nearby, I think the important thing is to emphasize to Zoe that it's totally up to her how much she wants to see her grandmother. Grandma shouldn't guilt her into it, but imo you also shouldn't try to talk her out of it. It doesn't sound like you would consciously, but if you don't want her to then kids can pick up on those things. If I were her I wouldn't be particularly interested, but I think it's not uncommon for some teens who have lost a parent--even if it was a complicated and/or not great relationship--to want to strengthen the connections they have with that side of the family.", "NTA your daughter deserves to know the truth and deserves to be surrounded by unconditional love that your ex mil never provided. She chose her path, she can deal with the consequences. Don\u2019t force your daughter to build a relationship with her, no matter how persistent the old bat gets. That\u2019s years of feeling unloved and unwanted that she can never make up for especially during such critical years of her life. She may get triggered having to be around her so much. If she moves into the same city, do not allow her into your home, that\u2019s both of your safe place that shouldn\u2019t be disrupted. If she wants to meet, you can do strictly lunch/dinners at a restaurant, but that\u2019s also up to your daughter if she chooses to do so.", "She can do what she wants but that doesnt mean you also have to do what she wants.NAT", "And it wasn\u2019t your responsibility to \u201cdeepen the relationship with her grandma.\u201d She had a father who could have done that, and he chose not to. Grandma herself could have done that too, but she didn\u2019t.", "Zoe is old enough to decide herself what type of relationship she wants to have with her paternal GM. I wouldn't tell zoe that it's because of visa issues at this stage, but would act as a buffer between PGM and Zoe if she wants one.  Zoe doesn't need to be pressured from her.", "GREAT analogy!", "Yeah and it\u2019s not like she made a decision over her head she told her to not count on having as close of a relationship with them as MIL did before she went to go be with her son and his affair partner because you know he cheated on his wife then abandoned his child. \n\nRegardless of how many times she called or tried to contact her granddaughter she abruptly left do you know what it feels like to be 6 years old and watch your dad abandon you and move to a different country to live with his new family and your grandma do the same thing?", "That's exactly what she would say, her son needed her and her grandson needed her. But honestly when she left I was still a single mom working long hours while my ex was already married so I think you can make a practical argument that we did need her. I also think she had been getting itchy feet since retirement and wanted a life change like a new country. Which is valid but still", "Tell her slowly and help her by probably getting some therapy", "Zoe is old enough to decide herself. She\u2019s also old enough to know grandma has to return due to visa-issues, and not to reunite with Zoe. Well done by op to tell her this so grandma can\u2019t make her own truths.", "The end let Zoe decide she's not a baby, that mil needs to hear this hard truth from Zoe to accept it.NAT", "Well, you're not an asshole for letting MIL know the facts as they stand currently; she certainly should consider all that before she relocates.  There were probably kinder ways to say it. \n\nHowever, it does sound a little like you are going on \"offense\" here to  prevent them having a better relationship.  Even if she moves to your area, you're not compelled to upend your life to accommodate MIL, but why not leave the door open to possibilities?", "ok fair enough!"]}
