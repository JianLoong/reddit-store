His mom, MIL, was initially sympathetic but when AP got pregnant, she moved to their country to be closer to her grandchild. He and AP later got married and had another baby.\n\nIt did felt like a betrayal at the time from Zoe's POV, she lost her dad as well as her grandma. She would visit her dad on some school breaks and part of summer and see her grandma there, and we'd keep in contact via FaceTime, but it wasn't the same. However, by that point I was marrying my 2nd husband whose family adores Zoe so that softened the blow. We also moved to a different state.\n\nMy ex passed away in 2021, which was devastating for all of us. Initially MIL stayed on to support her young grandsons and my ex's poor grieving wife. But without my ex there, there are some immigration/visa issues, so she's \"choosing\" to move back to the US.\n\nShe called me and said that she had decided to move to our state to be closer to Zoe [now 12]. She has no other connections here. I said we'll be happy to invite you to bdays and maybe get together for Christmas Eve, but that our family is busy these days and Zoe is about to enter her teenage years so she should take that into account. She started talking about wanting to spend a lot more 1:1 time with my daughter. I said frankly she'd lost the right to demand 1:1 access years ago and she should bear in mind that Zoe was ambivalent at best about her and with her entering her teen years that prob wasn't going to change. MIL said she was grieving and this was her late son's old daughter and her blood. I said she had all but abandoned Zoe just as her son had, and she couldn't expect to just pick up where she\u2019d left off and that Zoe now had step-grandparents who played a part in her life that MIL had effectively left vacant. I said she could move where she wanted, that was her choice, but don't count on this relationship.\n\nShe was very upset and accused me of trying to erase her Zoe\u2019s father and paternal family to make room for her stepfather/stepfamily, and has said that I\u2019m alienating her Zoe against her. For example, she's upset that I told Zoe in passing that she was having visa issues months ago, because it interferes with her \"I'm coming back just for you\" narrative. And the truth is that I've always made sure Zoe is nice/civil but even before my ex died, I haven't done much to encourage Zoe to deepen the relationship with her grandma. It was hard for her to visit her dad and see MIL being her half-siblings' grandma. She also has complex feelings toward her half-siblings and stepmom. She knows MIL is moving back but I didn't tell her that MIL wants to move here yet. As a parent I don't know if it would be healthy for her, especially since I don't think MIL can be trusted to stick around if she gets a better offer. But maybe it wasn't my place to tell her not to move.", "created_utc": 1684866532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pwjct/aita_for_telling_my_grieving_exmil_not_to_move/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You told her she could do what she wanted, but not to count on Zoe's mandatory attention. That's just setting a healthy expectation for a teen who might feel abandoned by her grandma.\n\nYou could have said it more gently, but you have every reason to feel heated on your daughter's behalf too. At the end of the day, you're just setting expectations so MIL can make the right decision for herself.", "NTA - as you said, she can do what she wants but that doesnt mean you also have to do what she wants. \n\nYou cant just erase those feelings of abandonment", "NTA - I would have told her a lot more than that!  Good for you!", "NTA. She made her choice long ago, and good on you for making her live with the consequence. You COULD have done her over by not saying anything, and then once she was there limit her access and she'd be upset because she \"moved there under false hope of seeing her granddaughter.\" But you didn't, you basically gave her fair warning, which was more than decent of you. I would say, let it be Zoe's choice if she wants to see MIL or not, if she wants to, I wouldn't interfere. But good on you not forcing it! : )", "NTA. I suspect Zoe's father did more to \"erase\" himself and his family than you could accomplish. \n\nIf you were truly being just spiteful I might say E-S-H, but you were willing to allow her some sort of relationship on yours and your daughter's terms. She not only wanted more but tried to play the victim when you put up reasonable boundaries. She sucks, do what you gotta for you and your kid.", "NTA. You told MIL that she and her son abandoned your daughter. Make sure you emphasize that. If she wants grandma rights and goes to a judge, you and your granddaughter should tell him the same thing. That should end things.", "NTA,  sod that!  She dumped Zoe to chase the new grandkids, now she can't stay there she wants to come crawling back? Nah.

She chose Zoe's half siblings over her and presumably did not prioritize 1-on-1 time with Zoe when she visited. MIL single-handedly created a grandmother-sized vacancy in Zoe's life that has since been at least partially filled by people who have spent more time with Zoe in recent years.\n\nMIL doesn't get to pretend that the last six years never happened. You are NTA at all. Good job sticking up for Zoe and watching out for her. She mostly lost her father and grandmother years ago. She completely lost her father recently.

The only one who alienated her was grandma herself. In my opinion she lost all rights to be Zoe's grandmother.", "NTA\n\nGrandma made a choice and has to live with it.", "You are absolutely correct that your daughter might not want to spend much time with her. It's also good to set boundaries because MIL might feel very entitled to you and your daughter's time. Which, in the end, might leave MIL lonely and frustrated. Now, if she's OK with limited time and is able to create a fulfilling personal life, then there shouldn't be a problem there. Good luck and NTA.", "NTA - ex husband and all his family have abandoned Zoe and deserve no opportunity to re-enter her life on any terms but Zoe's.\n\nGood for you for standing up for your daughter!", "NTA.

I had a job at 14 that took up a lot of my time outside of school, there\u2019s friends, clubs , sports , a lot of things happening around that age that leave less time family in a teens life. As her mother you should be capitalizing on the time you have with her, not trying to force her to share her free time with her grandmother she has complicated feelings towards", "NTA. Stand your ground and protect your daughter. Your EX MIL is her grandmother, but that's something she should have thought about too when hotfooting off to her son's new family, leaving you and your daughter in the dust. Good for you for building a new life and it's a reach for MIL to expect a big warm welcome.", "NTA \n\nYou're giving a reality check. She essentially killed that relationship herself.", "NTA but get ready for the shit storm that\u2019s rolling into town. MIL isn\u2019t taking no for an answer, I don\u2019t envy the hell she\u2019s about to bring to your life. Hate to say it but you better prepare your daughter and in-laws", "NTA  cant leave and pick up where you left off...your daughter  is older now there are other things she rather do", "Nta\u2026 honestly she chose not having a relationship long ago. She could\u2019ve flew to visit her a few times a year but she didn\u2019t care about that relationship because she had 2 other grandkids, now that she\u2019s having visa issues she\u2019s just the most convenient one", "You didn't even tell her not to move.

NTA", "NTA, so, your ex-mil took your cheating partner's side when she saw fit, and now that her son is no more she wants her gran daughter back? nope. To me, that is a big no-no, imagine if she has another opportunity to abandon her, she has been left out twice already, do not let this happen to your daughter again", "NTA. MIL made her bed; made it clear that she prioritized the other grandchildren. Too bad for her.", "NTA she abandoned her granddaughter because she\u2019s trash and now she gets to reap what she\u2019s sown. This is how it always happens the dads entire family abandons the child then play victim. Trashy people abandon kids it\u2019s that simple.", "Exactly what I was going to say, that if the ex hadn't died then the MIL wouldn't have made any effort to get close to Zoe, probably ever. I totally understand wanting to be close to what you have left of your son, but it doesn't mean you get a pass", "I don't think OP is hostile to the *idea* of grandma seeing Zoe more, she just has reasonable concerns about how it would work out.\n\nThe fact is that there is no way for anyone to maintain the same sort of relationship they had before while seeing someone just during summers/breaks. That's not even counting the understandable resentment that Zoe would feel at being abandoned. That doesn't mean MIL did anything wrong by following her son, just that her diminished relationship with Zoe is an unavoidable consequence. \n\nZoe may decide that she does not want to spend lots of 1-on-1 time with grandma, in which case it would be foolish and a recipe for disaster for ex-MIL to move close to them expressly for that purpose.", "He was a very involved dad during the first 6 years of her life and if he'd stayed in the area he absolutely would have gotten 50/50 maybe more even, but the fact that he moved countries was not a good look and of course no judge was going to uproot Zoe to a country where she didn't speak the language or make a 6yo fly internationally twice a month. For the first year he barely saw her but then the next few years she went there on some school breaks and a month in the summer. When her school went remote in 2020, I let her finish out the school year there even. The legal agreement heavily favored her primarily residing in the US, but I was always open to visits and him having a relationship with her. He did love her, he just didn't love her enough to prioritize her, if that makes sense. And of course he thought he'd have years and maybe when the boys were a little older etc etc. During that time, MIL lived with them so she would see MIL when she was with her dad. For MIL it was out of sight out of mind, Zoe got the sense that she wasn't a priority. Zoe and I went there when her dad died and Zoe stayed a little longer, but since then she hasn't seen MIL at all. If she expressed an interest in seeing her half-siblings/stepmom/MIL I'd have been open to it but she did not."]}
