His mom, MIL, was initially sympathetic but when AP got pregnant, she moved to their country to be closer to her grandchild. He and AP later got married and had another baby.\n\nIt did felt like a betrayal at the time from Zoe's POV, she lost her dad as well as her grandma. She would visit her dad on some school breaks and part of summer and see her grandma there, and we'd keep in contact via FaceTime, but it wasn't the same. However, by that point I was marrying my 2nd husband whose family adores Zoe so that softened the blow. We also moved to a different state.\n\nMy ex passed away in 2021, which was devastating for all of us. Initially MIL stayed on to support her young grandsons and my ex's poor grieving wife. But without my ex there, there are some immigration/visa issues, so she's \"choosing\" to move back to the US.\n\nShe called me and said that she had decided to move to our state to be closer to Zoe [now 12]. She has no other connections here. I said we'll be happy to invite you to bdays and maybe get together for Christmas Eve, but that our family is busy these days and Zoe is about to enter her teenage years so she should take that into account. She started talking about wanting to spend a lot more 1:1 time with my daughter. I said frankly she'd lost the right to demand 1:1 access years ago and she should bear in mind that Zoe was ambivalent at best about her and with her entering her teen years that prob wasn't going to change. MIL said she was grieving and this was her late son's old daughter and her blood. I said she had all but abandoned Zoe just as her son had, and she couldn't expect to just pick up where she\u2019d left off and that Zoe now had step-grandparents who played a part in her life that MIL had effectively left vacant. I said she could move where she wanted, that was her choice, but don't count on this relationship.\n\nShe was very upset and accused me of trying to erase her Zoe\u2019s father and paternal family to make room for her stepfather/stepfamily, and has said that I\u2019m alienating her Zoe against her. For example, she's upset that I told Zoe in passing that she was having visa issues months ago, because it interferes with her \"I'm coming back just for you\" narrative. And the truth is that I've always made sure Zoe is nice/civil but even before my ex died, I haven't done much to encourage Zoe to deepen the relationship with her grandma. It was hard for her to visit her dad and see MIL being her half-siblings' grandma. She also has complex feelings toward her half-siblings and stepmom. She knows MIL is moving back but I didn't tell her that MIL wants to move here yet. As a parent I don't know if it would be healthy for her, especially since I don't think MIL can be trusted to stick around if she gets a better offer. But maybe it wasn't my place to tell her not to move.", "created_utc": 1684866532, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pwjct/aita_for_telling_my_grieving_exmil_not_to_move/", "score": 2268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For the first year he barely saw her but then the next few years she went there on some school breaks and a month in the summer. When her school went remote in 2020, I let her finish out the school year there even.

Never happy where she is or who she\u2019s with in life. In my case she followed my aunt and cousins around the country. She lived in the next town over seeing us regularly until I was about 10. After that I would usually get birthday cards, and occasionally birthday calls (usually on the wrong day because my bday is Aug 25 and my cousin, one she followed, is Sept 22 so she would usually call me on Aug 22 smh) but those stopped probably around the time I turned 18. She didn\u2019t come to either college graduation even tho I was promised she was coming to my graduate degree graduation. What she DID do was call me after that graduation and had the audacity to tell me a relationship went both ways. Lmfao. Tell that to 12 year old me. Anyways I\u2019m 33 now and because of life I\u2019m currently living with my mom and said grandma (my mom\u2019s relationship with her is also very complicated. Always came second to her sister). She\u2019s lived with us for 2 years almost now and I have absolutely zero emotional connection to her even now. She talks to my cousins and aunt for HOURS daily. Literally every single day throughout the entire day she\u2019s rotating through the 3 of them. I\u2019ve never had and honestly at this point don\u2019t even want that kind of relationship with her. She\u2019s just someone who happens to share dna with me. \n\nAnyways. It can be complicated to have a grandparent like this. Maybe talk to your daughter and see what see wants? Maybe get her to a counselor to help process those types of emotions as they come up? I think those may have helped me when I was younger. I also didn\u2019t have a good relationship with my other grandma, she severed the relationship with me when I was 13 and she wrote me a scathing 3 page hand written letter that absolutely tore me as a person to shreds for a perceived slight.

My daughter isn't stupid, has spent six years thinking about this between calls and visits, and probably realizes she's not that important to you.\" I'm sure OP would be glad to set these things up **if her daughter wants them, which she probably doesn't.**", "You seem to be responding to hostility that OP just isn't demonstrating. The OP clearly outlines that she isn't trying to prevent the woman from moving close, but that she should temper her expectations. It's the grandmother who is pushing and expecting something and now throwing tantrums because OP isn't actively facilitating her attempt to bond with a girl who is probably no longer interested. The girl has spent half her life probably contemplating just how she places within her fathers, and grandmothers, priorities and rightly assessed that she didn't place very high, so...of course she's indifferent. These things happen.", "Sounds like that might be due to some sort of visa issue. Meaning she *has* to leave that country.\nAnd she\u2019s trying to ply it off as moving back for Zoe. Which is gross.", "It absolutely is your place to protect your daughter by being honest with your MIL about the realities (and dangers to your daughter's emotional well being in a plenty fraught time) you perceive and she doesn't. \n\nI think you've masterfully and empathetically been realistic with the ex MIL (and I couldn't have been nearly as diplomatic). \n\nShe was fine leaving her \"blood\" behind when she left and doesn't get to pop back into your daughter's life as a consolation prize, no matter hiow much she's grieving. That's not your daughter's cross to bear. Your boundaries, all for your daughter's sake, are more than reasonable. She's not thinking at all about what's best for your daughter.\n\n Definitely NTA.", "I would absolutely correct the misperception if Grandma tries to tell Zoe the lie- and that's what it is, an outright lie- that she came back just for Zoe. I would deny contact just on those grounds alone. Grandma came right out and shamelessly said she intends to start the relationship with an emotionally manipulative falsehood. That is a massive, *massive* red flag. \n\nNobody should ever be angry at a parent for telling their child the truth about something like this. Let alone being openly upset because the truth interferes with your plan to guilt trip a child and try to make them feel like they're in your debt for something *you never actually did.* That's so messed up I can't even properly express how unhealthy it is.", "Exactly", "\"Don't speak ill of the dead\" is a concept that really needs to die. Like, time and place, yes. But \"this person is dead so we can never again mention the shitty, harmful things they did\" is poisonous garbage. If they didn't want people to talk about the pain they caused they shouldn't have caused it.\nEdited because my stupid fat fingers hit post too early", "How much you want to bet that when grandma moves back and gets low to no contact with Zoe, she starts claiming \"grandparent alienation\" and threatening court action?", "As harsh as it sounds, MIL has prioritized her son and grandsons over her granddaughter for the past 6 years. She can't be trusted.", "Totally agree about the son.  She considers the granddaughter as leftovers cause other options have closed.", "Don\u2019t you hate those, spelling issues?", "She might try it but it\u2019s be there\u2019s a pretty obvious paper trial. They can see she left. They can check phone records to see how infrequently grandma reached out, they can see that grandma only started showing an interest in Zoe when she had visa issues and had to leave her preferred\u2019 grandkids.\n\nI think grandparent alienation only works when the grandparents actually were and actively tried to be a part of the grandkids lives", "Yep", "I think some are being harsh here. Including potentially op. Once her son was having another child she had a grandchild in both places. It was not possible for her to live in both places. Choosing to be in the location where she had 1 grandchild and 1 son over the place where she had only 1 grandchild is frankly logical. It became even more so when her son had another child there. She had already been there 8 years for Zoe. The new grandchildren were no less deserving of their grandmother. Was that hard for Zoe? Of course it was. That doesn't mean it wasn't the best of the bad choices available to her. \n\nThat she is moving back now may be largely down to Visa issues, but presumably she has a whole country she can live in. That she wants to move to a city where the only connection she has is Zoe as opposed to the one she lived in before where she would presumably have some connections or community speaks to her love for Zoe. That she is a priority. No, she isn't choosing her over her siblings, but that's really not a fair thing to ask or a reasonable expectation. Her relationship with one grandchild isn't more important than with another. \n\nZoes feelings ultimately are the most important thing here. She's allowed to feel hurt by her grandma leaving, it was hard for her regardless of whether it was potentially the best of some rather bad options available. That doesn't mean though that Zoe isn't important to her grandma or she doesn't love her very much. The very fact she wants to move there suggests she does. Zoe certainly shouldn't be forced to have a close relationship with her grandma but I see nothing here that suggests it should be discouraged either.", "Stunned how many people are attacking the MIL because she chose the option that maximized the time she got to spend with all her grandchildren and her son instead of focusing on one grandchild", "YTA, I\u2019m sure this will be an unpopular opinion here but don\u2019t deny your daughter a better relationship with her grandma over your spite. I started spending a lot of time around my grandma around that age and that was one of the most important relationships in my life. If your daughter feels betrayed that her grandma moved to be near her son that\u2019s bc you put that on her. You\u2019re mad at your mother in law and you\u2019re going to ruin your daughter\u2019s relationship with her.", "NTA. You're managing expectations in advance. If my own parents announced they were moving to my town, I would do the same.", "NTA you are protecting your child from a woman who seems to be becoming a \u201cserial abandoner\u201d. She abandoned her granddaughter when her son left the country, became involved in her son\u2019s new family, is now abandoning that family and returning to you. And she things she\u2019s going to just pick up with your daughter like nothing happened? Make that make sense. It sounds like it\u2019s a good time to be a protective mama bear", "NTA", "NTA- your instincts are right about this. You are doing the right thing here protecting your daughter and being honest with her grandmother. Maybe consider enlisting the help of an adolescent  therapist who can help your daughter navigate dealing with all of these feelings and relationships.", "you are not the asshole periodtttt", "NTA Zoe isn\u2019t an emotional support animal. No such effort would have gone into spending time with Zoe if your ex hadn\u2019t died and her visa hadn\u2019t run into difficulties.", "NTA Zoe isn\u2019t an emotional support animal. No such effort would have gone into spending time with Zoe if your ex hadn\u2019t died and her visa hadn\u2019t run into difficulties.", "NTA protect your kid. Your MIL is going to try and force something that isn\u2019t there and then probably guilt her when she doesn\u2019t feel love for her. Also she\u2019ll probably make Zoe feel bad about her complex feelings about her father. I\u2019m getting the feeling that MIL will make it so Zoe can\u2019t say anything bad about her dad or she\u2019ll try to make a wedge between Zoe and her step family to give herself space. Limit and supervise their interactions.", "MIL thinks Zoe is a toy she can put down, then pick up when it's convenient.\n\nI really appreciate the way you're handling this. Protect your daughter.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn't tell her not to move. You warned her that the support animal relationship she has envisioned having with Zoe will likely not be happening.", "I'm not sure I believe grandma wants a relationship with Zoe as much as she doesn't have any other place to go.", "NTA-- Your and your daughter's life doesn't have to stop just because a relative moves nearby. If your daughter wants to fit in some time with her late father's mom, then she can; if your daughter is busy, she's not obligated to rearrange her life for anyone.", "NTA. It is fine if your ex-MIL wants to move near you to build her own life and try to reconnect with Zoe, but it sounds like she is putting all of her interest in Zoe without creating her own life.\n\nThe truth is Zoe is going into her teen years and will eventually be moving out on her own. Your ex-MIL needs to be making choices for her own future. I don't know how old your ex-MIL is, but I would strongly recommend her moving near her family or friends from the past. She needs to create a network to support her in her older years. \n\nSuggest she rent an Airbnb for a couple of weeks near you. She can check out the area and she may realize how busy your family is and how Zoe is no longer the little girl she left years ago.", "When my son moved across the country, before there were any grandchildren, I had a choice regarding the relationship I would have with the grandchild to come.  My Grand-baby, the love of my life, my pride & joy.  I could have gone with face time calls, photo books & phone calls.  I made it my business to travel to them, at least every 3 months.  I overcame a fear of flying & traveling alone, because my spouse simply couldn\u2019t come with me every time.  We eventually relocated, to them.  We now live within walking distance, attend every athletic event & spend most weekends together as a family.  A relationship with a child begins at birth.  You really can\u2019t expect to drop into the picture a decade later & expect there to be a connection or warm fuzzy feelings.  I like to believe my son & D-I-L appreciate the family net, given we\u2019re here to help with transport, house/pet sitting, etc, hell I know they appreciate it they were instrumental in getting us down here.  LOL", "NTA. I think it's kind to warn your exMIL that she shouldn't bank on Zoe immediately opening up to her/treating her as a grandma. Better that you let her know now than after she's put a down payment on a house/chosen to move to your town. You didn't tell her she couldn't move there; you just let her know about the consequences of her actions on the relationship she has with her granddaughter and that you're not going to force anything.", "Nta", "NTA and thank you so much for protecting Zoe by telling her the truth and not forcing a relationship. If my grandma chose my half sibling over me (in a situation like this) I'd never fully forgive her and forcing me to hang out with her would be torture.", "Be real with yourself. If you hadn\u2019t said it, you would have regretted not getting it off your chest. Of course your little girl comes first but I\u2019m sure you have some real feelings toward ex MIL that feel personal as well. Good for you standing up for yourself and your daughter. Keep taking care of the two of you and keep a little bubble around you both. Let everything else happen as it will. You can\u2019t predict the future.", "YTA", "Well said", "Happy\ud83c\udf82day!", "I was thinking the same. I think OP should consider having the step dad adopt Zoe (if Zoe is agreeable) to try avert potential rights claim.", "Zoe flew to granma every year.", "Totally! Were it not for her visa issues she would have stayed in the life she had established with 2 of her grandchildren instead of starting over in a new place, where she knows no one and has no support system so that she can be near her third grandchild", "6 years? Gramma saw Zoe multiple times a year every year and facetimed in between.", "Why does gramma deserve it? She didn't cause the situation. She figured out a way to spend the most time possible with her three grandchildren and her son. As far as I can tell, she didn't live near Zoe before the divorce, and moving where the ex-husband is helps to ensure that Zoe and her grandmother can maintain the relationship. To me it sounds like OP is upset that gramma didn't choose Zoe over the new grandchildren.", "What\u2019s your point? Planes fly both ways and she was there to visit her father, her grandmother was just there. If she actually cared about her or the relationship she\u2019s fly to see her a few times a year.. but she didn\u2019t\u2026 but now that she\u2019s having visa issues she\u2019s the convenient grandchild who she didn\u2019t care about having a relationship prior because she had two other grandchildren.", "Did he or ex-MIL come visit Zoe much? I know he had two young children, but it's definitely preferable (to my mind) for an adult to travel to visit their child than that child travel to another country where she doesn't speak the language.", "My point is that Zoe saw her grandmother several times a year. That we know. We don't know if gramma could afford to spend money on an international flight simply to spend money on an international flight. We don't know if mom would have put her up or if she would have had to spend additional money on a hotel. We know that OP remarried, so we can't assume that she could have stayed with them. Gramma came up with a way to see all of her grandchildren as much as possible.  When she couldn't see her in person she made time to video chat with the girl. There is zero evidence that she didn't care about having a relationship and plenty of evidence that she made an effort to keep in contact with Zoe.", "I really think don\u2019t speak ill of the dead should be reserved for funerals and for shortly after the person died. \n\nLike the day they died not the time to speak ill of them especially if it was sudden. And then at the funeral don\u2019t speak ill of them. If you have nothing nice to say at those two points don\u2019t be present. After that just check what company you\u2019re in before you go balls to the walls with it. And use some common sense. Little kid who didn\u2019t really know the person keep it vaguish or just not mention it. \n\nOlder adult who keeps singing the persons praises correct them. Vent with your safe people if you wanna go full throttle into the I had a shit relationship. But other wise be polite about it but don\u2019t sugar coat it. \n\nSo say someone died and they were the shittiest partner imaginable. Instead of wording it that way put it as \u201che was the worst partner I\u2019ve ever had for these reasons\u201d", "Oh I'm not saying she'd be successful or that any lawyer would even take the case.\n\nI said she'd threaten. She sounds like the type.", "And it's a much harder sell than parental alienation. Courts really want to make sure that kids can see their parents, and if OP's ex had come back to the country and said he wanted to spend more time with Zoe, he probably would have been given something, but I can't see the courts giving ex-MIL much. \n\nAlso, I just hate the \"but we're blood!\" argument - you were blood when you moved country and let your son move country and basically never see his daughter too, but that didn't stop you. The fact that the step-grandparents have been loving and filled this role without blood relationships makes them all the better, to my mind."]}
