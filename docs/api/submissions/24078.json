I used to nanny a 6 yo with ADD and some days were HELL - I\u2019m talking violent tantrums (he drew blood on multiple occasions) and his older sister unfortunately often got pushed off to the side because of it. Thankfully with a few changes in his schedule (and some medication/diet trials) that kept him engaged and active, we were able to get a good rhythm and I would now not even consider his ADD a hinderance at all.\n\nI ask (and give this example) because honestly, no one here in the comments knows if you or your MIL is at fault here. Yes, it is absolutely important that you don\u2019t allow her to play favorites. However, 100% equal treatment isn\u2019t the solution to that - 100% love and attention to each is. For your daughter, depending on her behavior, that could look very different.\n\nMaybe OPs daughter is very mildly ADD and MIL is just being a weird mean old lady. Maybe OP is being willfully ignorant to the struggle it is to supervise the daughter. Maybe (most likely) it\u2019s somewhere in between. No one knows these answers but you OP, so I hope you take a nice honest look at the situation before moving forward in whatever way is best for both your children and their unique needs.", "ESH but your kids.  I have ADHD and I know I was a handful.  Yeah your MIL for evidently favoritism but I really have to wonder what else your son may miss out on or if he ends up getting less attention than his sister because you're so focused on her.\n\nI get it if you don't want to medicate her but you need to at least have her in some for of behavioral therapy", "If Y T A, then I am also. Same situation. Husband and I never let his mother keep our kids because they only wanted the one. I will not do this to my grandchildren.", "I have an older daughter we adopted who is now 22. My MIL does nothing with her. She has a son she disowned and with it 2 grandchildren she never sees. My husband agrees with me. We let it go on for awhile because she blamed my FIL for why my daughter couldn\u2019t come over. He works and can\u2019t handle the energy. Doesn\u2019t want a chatterbox. When he died, she suddenly changed her tune. My son has a room there with gaming, computer and everything he wants. It\u2019s paradise he\u2019s treated like a king. And my daughter gets, sorry sweetie. When your older.", "I\u2019m also afraid your son will grow to resent his sister. I\u2019m also afraid that you might be playing favorites in your own home.  Your daughter probably gets more attention from you and your husband.  I totally get this because she has disabilities and you have to give her more attention.  Your son might even grow to resent you for taking away a person who loves him and gives him the undivided attention he wants.", ">Your mil has told you that she can't handle your daughter. Believe her\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, ADHD kids can be a real handful, especially for someone who is not used to it. And it's pretty awful for the kid as well because people get impatient with them, and sometimes snappy, out of sheer frustration.\n\nI'd recommend this: spend an afternoon with your kids at MIL's house. Leave your son there and take your daughter out for ice cream, and then take her home and watch her favourite movie with her. Besides everyone spending time together and your son getting his sleepover, your daughter will get one on one time with you  - and you'll have a chance to observe how she is at MIL's house.\n\nNAH.", "I wonder if the daughter gets all the attention because she has ADD.The son gets attention from his grandmother.", "But she's not using grandma as childcare so I don't really see how the grandma is helping her. And while grandma is allowed to set boundaries so is the mom and moms boundary is no favoritism that will hurt my kids. Why is it OK for grandma to have a boundary but not op?", "But this isn't about childcare. This is about grandma giving only one child one on one time. The younger kid is now at an age that she noticed it. That means hurt feeling. Possibly core memories of rejection by an important family member her brother always gushes about. \n\nMaybe the three of them can do a girls' day together, but I'm a bit unsure from this if the grandma is completely refusing to form a relationship because the girl is much or if she just doesn't want to be the sole adult responsible for her at this point. I can't blame OP at all if it's the first case. The second one is just sad, but if you can't handle a child alone you can't, and OP should make sure there is another adult around to support grandma.", "How ridiculous! Your MIL seems to be the problem- there is a reason why there are so many people who are no longer in her life and if she isn\u2019t careful the four of you are next. \n\nOf course your son wants to go there! What 8 year old boy wouldn\u2019t want him own gaming center?? She probably brings him freshly squeezed lemonade and holds the straw up to his mouth too while he is playing. \n\nI\u2019m sorry OP that you and your family have this tough decision to make. Hopefully one day your son will understand.", "Probably. My son's needs end up taking up a lot of my time. I live with so much guilt about it. I do try and make time for just them but I know that one day they will justifiably call me out on it and how it made them feel. That said, if they get special time with an aunt or grandparent I'm happy for them to get some special personalized attention for this reason.", "Because grandma is older and not the parent. Grandma is being SO RESPECTFUL by saying she can't handle the ADD child. She cares more about the child's health and safety than her own ego\n\nEdit: \n\nFurthermore, a babysitter would charge more for a child with special needs"]}
