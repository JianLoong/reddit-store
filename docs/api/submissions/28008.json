You refused to sit down and insisted it was \"unnatural\", but you're a grown-ass man who couldn't manage to pee without doing it all over the seat and the floor, so clearly you do, in fact, need to sit your ass down to pee until you potty train properly. \n\nAnd then you didn't even clean up after yourself? Are you feral, peeing all over someone's bathroom and then acting like it's NBD? You should be way more embarrassed than you apparently are.", "Obviously YTA, even without being asked to sit, you pissed on your friend's seat and floor and didn't clean it up.\n\nYou're not a child.

You blew your chance to debate anything the moment you pissed on his toilet and floor.", "Kinda seems like you demonstrated the exact reason they wanted you to sit.

I never knew most men are inconsiderate when it comes to piss all over the bathroom until I moved out because my dad always sat for his morning piss. He didn't want to have to clean it either.  Tell me you don't clean up after yourself at home without telling me.", "YTA. You peed on the seat and floor and failed to clean up after yourself.

Your friends request to sit down would only be unreasonable if you were an adult who knew to clean up his own urine after being unable to keep it in the toilet. You\u2019re obviously not grown enough to be able to use a shared bathroom respectfully, so you\u2019ve got to sit.

YTA", "Is this story for real ? Lmao. YTA for not checking for urine on the toilet/floor, esp given you were drunk as shit and might miss the toilet as you apparently did. Your friend thought ahead and knew his friends likely won't take it upon themselves to clean up and thus instructed u all to sit while peeing. It would seem he was correct in his assumptions.", "If you cant aim you need to sit. Shorter guns are typically less accurate, so theres that too", "YTA.

And an ASSHOLE.", "You were dunk and made a poor life choice.  Instead of manning up, apologizing for your mistake, you blamed your host.

It was a simple rule and you couldn't follow it. And then you argued about it when you made a mess and didn't clean it up. Drunkenness is not an excuse for poor behaviour.

Correct response would have been to apologize and then clean it up. \n\nI wouldn't expect to be invited over again either, especially since you doubled down by arguing with him about your right to piss all over his bathroom.\n\nOP, YTA.

I don\u2019t know why sitting to pee can\u2019t be a thing for men.  My husband has always sat to pee.  So when we have male guests I cringe knowing they are peeing standing up and splattering pee in my bathroom.  It bothers my husband too.  We clean and sanitize the toilet and floor after they leave.", "YTA \n\nNo one is going to ask me to sit, but on the rare occasion I fire 10\u00b0 off I check then clean up. My guess is you've been missing often and just can't bother because someone has cleaned up after you for a while.", "Did you put ketchup on your steak yesterday?", "YTA If you had peed standing up and not made a mess, that's one thing. But you did the thing you were asked not to do, made a mess, and didn't clean it up. Even if they hadn't asked you not to pee while standing up, leaving pee on their floor is still a jerky move.

Apologize, explain you were drunk and forgot, clean up your mess and move on. Maybe offer to clean the toilet daily for the rest of your stay to show your sincerity and that you\u2019re not trying to disrespect your friend in his place. IMO this is no different than taking off your shoes in someone\u2019s home and this issue came about because you made it an issue by not cleaning up after yourself. Your inability to make good decisions because of alcohol is not your friend\u2019s problem.", "so the bathroom floor at your house is just caked in piss or what? YTA, obviously", "Since when was a man sitting on the toilet to pee unnatural!?! LOL", "Think a rule to aim good and clean up after yourself and disinfectant wipes within reach.

As a woman I would not expect my male relatives to urinate when sitting because that\u2019s probably not how they were taught to go as a child.

I\u2019ve heard this is pretty common practice in Europe as well.", "Also the PURE splash factor. If you wore clothing reactive to piss and went to piss into the toilet, you would come back bespeckled from your thighs to your knees.", "This is definitely YTA because OP didn't listen to his friend, furthered by the fact that he didn't clean up after himself. \n\nWhy do you think everyone should sit in general though?

Most men, around 70%, stand up.", "Nobody\u2019s sitting to piss in a toilet unless they also plan on shitting. I bet OP wasn\u2019t the only one standing and pissing in that cabin.

You'd be told to pack your things and fuck off in a second.", "or just learn to aim seriously its not that hard.

I don't care if a man stands or sits or does cartwheels as long as his piss gets in the actual toilet.", "I hope it isn't, but I guess it is. Im a grown man and if it's night time I will sit down and pee if I woke up even in my own home.

Last thing I want is to be woken up by her stepping in it and freaking out because of it. Plus, I was taught to clean up after myself... if I missed the toilet, I would clean up after myself.

Cool, I can join. \n  \nI\u2019ve never seen a man make as big a mess of a toilet as women who crouch on top of the toilet. I used a one-hole, genderless bathroom after a middle-aged woman a few weeks ago, and I think she got more pee OUTSIDE the bowl than inside it. And just walked out without cleaning anything.

Everyone has missed before, albeit extremely rarely. You know what you do?! CLEAN IT UP!

I just don't understand how you're ever capable of using a toilet sitting down if you have such an absurd irrational fear.", "If someone asks you to sit while peeing in their house and you refuse to, the reasonable thing isn't to lie and do it anyway - it's to not use their bathroom. Wiping piss up is not \"cleaning\" and unless you magically aim for the bowl and not the water only, there is splashback and I very much doubt you're looking for bleach in a stranger's home to clean it up.\n\nWhat you do in your own home is your own business tho.

Help me understand.", "When I found out from my German friend that that's a thing, it made me so happy/sad. Even men without any toxic masculinity to speak of would not sit most of the time, because we teach them to piss standing up basically from as soon as they can stand (Aotearoa here.)\n\nMy partner perceives it as easier/faster, and I guess it is, nominally. But there are enough useless men (and most men lose pressure as they get older) that it would be nice if it was not the norm.", "To be fair, the 5yo\u2019s peeing device is awfully close to the bowl.

Don't clean the bathroom floor for a month and see what it smells like. I didn't say they PISS on the floor. I said they all get it on the floor.

When I worked in retail and had to clean the gentleman's bathroom. There's always pee all over the place. I'm not talking to drop or two. I'm talking puddles. Makes me wonder that it couldn't even be done on accident.
