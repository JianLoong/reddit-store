You refused to sit down and insisted it was \"unnatural\", but you're a grown-ass man who couldn't manage to pee without doing it all over the seat and the floor, so clearly you do, in fact, need to sit your ass down to pee until you potty train properly. \n\nAnd then you didn't even clean up after yourself? Are you feral, peeing all over someone's bathroom and then acting like it's NBD? You should be way more embarrassed than you apparently are.", "Obviously YTA, even without being asked to sit, you pissed on your friend's seat and floor and didn't clean it up.\n\nYou're not a child.

You blew your chance to debate anything the moment you pissed on his toilet and floor.", "Kinda seems like you demonstrated the exact reason they wanted you to sit. Also idk why everyone doesn\u2019t just sit to pee. You get to sit. No mess. It grows the economy. Benefits everybody. Hurts nobody!", "Yes YTA . I never knew most men are inconsiderate when it comes to piss all over the bathroom until I moved out because my dad always sat for his morning piss. He didn't want to have to clean it either.  Tell me you don't clean up after yourself at home without telling me.", "YTA. You peed on the seat and floor and failed to clean up after yourself. You are exactly the reason everyone was asked to sit when peeing.", "YTA for not cleaning up your own piss. Your friends request to sit down would only be unreasonable if you were an adult who knew to clean up his own urine after being unable to keep it in the toilet. You\u2019re obviously not grown enough to be able to use a shared bathroom respectfully, so you\u2019ve got to sit.

Drunk or not you should still be able to clean up your own piss", "Wait, it\u2019s lame to agree to sit and then not, but even if you do piss standing up, don\u2019t you lift the seat?!? YTA", "Is this story for real ? Lmao. YTA for not checking for urine on the toilet/floor, esp given you were drunk as shit and might miss the toilet as you apparently did. Your friend thought ahead and knew his friends likely won't take it upon themselves to clean up and thus instructed u all to sit while peeing. It would seem he was correct in his assumptions.", "If you cant aim you need to sit. Shorter guns are typically less accurate, so theres that too", "YTA.

And an ASSHOLE.", "You were dunk and made a poor life choice.  Instead of manning up, apologizing for your mistake, you blamed your host.

It was a simple rule and you couldn't follow it. And then you argued about it when you made a mess and didn't clean it up. Drunkenness is not an excuse for poor behaviour.

Correct response would have been to apologize and then clean it up. \n\nI wouldn't expect to be invited over again either, especially since you doubled down by arguing with him about your right to piss all over his bathroom.\n\nOP, YTA. To put it quite bluntly, you sound like an entitled toddler throwing a tantrum wrapped up in a blanket of 'needing to defend your rights as a man'. Grow up.", "YTA.  I don\u2019t know why sitting to pee can\u2019t be a thing for men.  My husband has always sat to pee.  So when we have male guests I cringe knowing they are peeing standing up and splattering pee in my bathroom.  It bothers my husband too.  We clean and sanitize the toilet and floor after they leave.", "YTA \n\nNo one is going to ask me to sit, but on the rare occasion I fire 10\u00b0 off I check then clean up. My guess is you've been missing often and just can't bother because someone has cleaned up after you for a while.", "Did you put ketchup on your steak yesterday?", "YTA If you had peed standing up and not made a mess, that's one thing. But you did the thing you were asked not to do, made a mess, and didn't clean it up. Even if they hadn't asked you not to pee while standing up, leaving pee on their floor is still a jerky move.

Apologize, explain you were drunk and forgot, clean up your mess and move on. Maybe offer to clean the toilet daily for the rest of your stay to show your sincerity and that you\u2019re not trying to disrespect your friend in his place. IMO this is no different than taking off your shoes in someone\u2019s home and this issue came about because you made it an issue by not cleaning up after yourself. Your inability to make good decisions because of alcohol is not your friend\u2019s problem.", "so the bathroom floor at your house is just caked in piss or what? YTA, obviously", "Since when was a man sitting on the toilet to pee unnatural!?! LOL", "Think a rule to aim good and clean up after yourself and disinfectant wipes within reach.

As a woman I would not expect my male relatives to urinate when sitting because that\u2019s probably not how they were taught to go as a child.

People are welcome to sit if they want, but I find it much more comfortable standing up.

I just don't see any issue with other people standing.\n\nI'll give an example of a \"why\" even if it borders on TMI: when I wake up in the morning or even in the middle of the night, I usually really have to pee and also have morning wood, so it's almost impossible to sit comfortably. I also have to go pretty bad and don't want to wait around.\n\nI also just find it more comfortable and easier to relax that way. Sometimes after I shit I'll stand up to finish peeing.
