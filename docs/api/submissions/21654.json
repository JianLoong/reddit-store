They're cool kids and I love having them over. However one of them, \u201cErik\u201d (14m) has a gigantic appetite. Like, literally every time I see this kid he's wolfing down food. You wouldn't think it because he's super lank, but I guess he's at that age where it's normal, I've been there. \n\nAt dinner last night we had a nice meat loaf and some mac and cheese. I gave everyone big servings, and the other two kids were happy with it, but naturally Erik wanted more. I told him he should probably just save room for dessert and he did. But he still wanted to eat another serving of dinner after dessert. I wanted to save some food for our dinner tomorrow, so I told him he couldn't have anymore. \n\nBut my wife (26f) went over my head and told Erik he could have more if he wanted, and he went on to eat so much he almost instantly fell asleep on the couch, where my other nephews were playing video games.\n\nIt was overall a really good day but I was miffed that my wife went over my head over the food thing, and when we went to bed I told her I felt like what we'd served was reasonable. She argued that since Erik is a guest he can have as much food as he wants, and she can always buy more (she usually stocks the kitchen). She thinks I'm being a jerk for thinking I can control how much we do or don't serve and that it's weird I would have told Erik he can't have another serving without at least checking with her first.\n\nI haven't been able to stop thinking about it since.

Eating is highly personal and tied to physical as well as mental health. \n\nYou say you have a good relationship with your nephews so I\u2019d let them eat so you can preserve that relationship. Some day they may be in a position to feed or help you and you wouldn\u2019t appreciate being controlled I\u2019m sure.\n\nAlso I think I\u2019d let them choose how much to put on their plates rather than you deciding and giving a serving. They\u2019re not toddlers.\n\nTry not to be controlling regarding food or other aspects of your life. It\u2019s a really bad habit/characteristic and it is extremely hard on relationships.\n\nThank goodness your wife saved the day. I\u2019d do some serious self reflection because controlling people rarely see their behavior for what it is and other people can tire of it quickly even if the controlling person has some good characteristics.  \n\nTbh controlling people are just not enjoyable to have in one\u2019s life long term.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nGrowing kids needs lots and lots of food at different times of their growth cycles.

Yes teenage boys eat a lot. I currently feed a 17 year old who is 6 ft 5 and 280 lbs so I understand where you are coming from. But he is not your child and this is not your business.

That's just bad host etiquette. Your wife is right.", "There's a reason they say teenagers will eat you out of house and home. This is that reason.
