They're cool kids and I love having them over. However one of them, \u201cErik\u201d (14m) has a gigantic appetite. Like, literally every time I see this kid he's wolfing down food. You wouldn't think it because he's super lank, but I guess he's at that age where it's normal, I've been there. \n\nAt dinner last night we had a nice meat loaf and some mac and cheese. I gave everyone big servings, and the other two kids were happy with it, but naturally Erik wanted more. I told him he should probably just save room for dessert and he did. But he still wanted to eat another serving of dinner after dessert. I wanted to save some food for our dinner tomorrow, so I told him he couldn't have anymore. \n\nBut my wife (26f) went over my head and told Erik he could have more if he wanted, and he went on to eat so much he almost instantly fell asleep on the couch, where my other nephews were playing video games.\n\nIt was overall a really good day but I was miffed that my wife went over my head over the food thing, and when we went to bed I told her I felt like what we'd served was reasonable. She argued that since Erik is a guest he can have as much food as he wants, and she can always buy more (she usually stocks the kitchen). She thinks I'm being a jerk for thinking I can control how much we do or don't serve and that it's weird I would have told Erik he can't have another serving without at least checking with her first.\n\nI haven't been able to stop thinking about it since.

Eating is highly personal and tied to physical as well as mental health. \n\nYou say you have a good relationship with your nephews so I\u2019d let them eat so you can preserve that relationship. Some day they may be in a position to feed or help you and you wouldn\u2019t appreciate being controlled I\u2019m sure.\n\nAlso I think I\u2019d let them choose how much to put on their plates rather than you deciding and giving a serving. They\u2019re not toddlers.\n\nTry not to be controlling regarding food or other aspects of your life. It\u2019s a really bad habit/characteristic and it is extremely hard on relationships.\n\nThank goodness your wife saved the day. I\u2019d do some serious self reflection because controlling people rarely see their behavior for what it is and other people can tire of it quickly even if the controlling person has some good characteristics.  \n\nTbh controlling people are just not enjoyable to have in one\u2019s life long term.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nGrowing kids needs lots and lots of food at different times of their growth cycles.

Yes teenage boys eat a lot. I currently feed a 17 year old who is 6 ft 5 and 280 lbs so I understand where you are coming from. But he is not your child and this is not your business.

But for the most part, as others have said, he's a growing boy with, it appears, a high metabolism and he needs the caloric intake.", "I mean, I would say YTA, but not really. Just it would be nice of you if you could be omre accomodating. Some perspective:  \n\n\nI have been the kid in this scenario. I was a super lanky kid that ate an absolutely unreasonable amount in my teens. I could EASILY polish off an entire box of cereal for breakfast. I sometimes would throw 10 eggs into a pan and make myself a 10 egg omelette on the weekends for breakfast. I could NOT stop eating.\n\nVisiting certain friend's houses sucked sometimes, because of parents having their own ideas about what a respectful amount of food to eat is. They would serve me what I considered to be an absolutely miniscule amount of food. As in I would take one look at the plate and would know beyond a shadow of a doubt that eating that food would have no impact on how hungry I feel. If i asked for more upfront, I would get denied (sometimes with derision, as if I was being greedy). If I tried to say that this isn't enough food for me or whatever, it would be a touchy subject and i was risking causing some sort of offense. So I would eat the food and ask for more. Then I would get hit with the \"No. Save space for desert\" like you did. It is very odd being confronted by someone pushing their own ideas about how much food you can eat onto you and denying you food because of it. Like \"No, you've eaten enough\", when you are literally still hungry as hell.\n\nI would lie in bed feeling really unsatisfied and hungry after dinner. I would start daydreaming about getting home and eating something. I would look in the kitchen to see if there is any food lying around that I could conceivably eat. Maybe they have some cereal. I know that if I ask for cereal they will hit me with \"No you just ate dinner\" or something (literally sometimes they would even get angry and rude about it). If they are especially stupid they will hit me with \"you can't eat cereal at night\".\n\nIf you can afford it without any hassle, it would be great if you could just accomodate this dude. It doesn't mean you need to give him more dinner if you wanted to save some for tomorrow. But if you were just like \"We want to leave some leftovers for tomorrow, if you're still hungry, I can offer you <cereal, fruit, nuts, other food>\".\n\nObviously, if money is an issue, then that's a discussion you would need to have with your wife. I can't imagine how expensive it must have been to raise me when I was going through that phase, good grief.", "I don\u2019t second my spouse in front of kids. I would have convinced my spouse to have a change of heart, then be the one to let the kid eat.", "I don't think YTA, but rather just bad at planning. He's 14, so he eats everything. Prepare additional food. The fact that you wanted to have some left over for the next day with additional mouths to feed was wishful thinking. Let him eat all the food he wants, and cook again the next day.

In the grand scheme of things this aggravation isn't worth giving a second thought. She shouldn't of gone over you, but you shouldn't get so upset.  People handle thing different. If over riding you becomes a pattern then give it some thought, and set some rules.", "It seems my opinion is slightly different to the majority. \n\nIf he was your child, then as an adult looking after a child I think it is important to control portion size. Although he is now a slim lad and and extra portion today is not going to make him obese overnight, if he continues to eat not only a large portion size and then go back for seconds to make it a supersize portion size it could quite easily become the norm for him to eat large amounts of food which in time will have an effect on his weight, health and understanding of a sensible diet. Providing you feed him enough to keep him healthy then a little control to give him a better understanding of healthy portion sizes is not a bad thing imo. \n\nHowever he\u2019s not your full time responsibility and in this situation you probably should have sided with your wife and treated him as a welcome guest that can eat as much as he desires \u263a\ufe0f", "Sounds like the beginning of a food addiction.

I always told kids to wait half an hour and if they are still hungry, they can make themself a sandwich. Mac and cheese and meatloaf is a high fat, high calory meal and he shouldn't eat too much of it, a sandwich is still not exactly healthy but at least not as bad. This way you could have saved some food for tomorrow and he still wouldn't left hungry.", "Guess I'm going to go against the grain here, but a light NTA here.

I personally would have lied and said there wasn't anymore and hid it lol. \n\n I have teen girls and when they have their friends over they are all on binge mode, it's insane how much food they can put away.  Groceries are expensive and I think after a point overeating (I don't care if he's lank) the body can only handle so much in a sitting and the extra food all goes to waste (hence his food coma after).  My girls and their friends will especially go through those large $10 pound plus containers of chopped fruit from the grocery.  I was TA recently when I saw they had gone through THREE  in a couple of hours on top of dinner(etc etc)  and were starting on a fourth one.  I had hidden it in the garage fridge so we'd have it for breakfast the next day so I was livid when I saw they had started in on it .  I actually went and took it and put it away.

He actually wanted to save some for later. And the child may have still been hungry but it\u2019s not like he would\u2019ve gone without a meal.\n\nIt comes down to different households with differing attitudes about food.
