I have great coworkers and the work environment is generally positive. However, there is this one coworker, let's call her Sarah (32F), who has been increasingly crossing boundaries.\n\nA bit of background, Sarah joined the company around a year ago, and we were initially friendly. We would have lunch together occasionally and chat about random things. I didn't think much of it, and it seemed like a normal office friendship. However, over time, I noticed that Sarah had started to use my belongings without asking for permission. For example, she would take my stapler, pens, or even my phone charger without asking. At first, I brushed it off as her just being forgetful and not realizing that these were my personal items. I tried to be understanding and not let it bother me.\n\nBut then, things started to escalate. One day, I brought in a special lunch I had prepared as a treat for myself. It was a dish that my grandmother used to make for me, and it had a lot of sentimental value. I had placed it in the fridge with a note clearly stating it was mine. When lunchtime came around, I discovered that Sarah had taken and eaten my lunch. I confronted her, and she apologized, claiming that she thought it was meant for the whole office to share. I didn't buy it, but I let it go to avoid causing a scene.\n\nOver the next few months, Sarah's behavior continued to worsen. She began using my personal laptop without asking, even though we all have our own work computers. She would also use my coffee mug and other personal items, despite me having my name on them. I tried to address it politely and asked her to stop, but she would just laugh it off and say she didn't mean any harm.\n\nFinally, I reached my breaking point last week. I had bought a new, expensive pair of headphones to use at work, and I had left them on my desk overnight. When I arrived the next day, I found Sarah using them at her desk. I was furious and asked her to hand them over immediately. She tried to play it off as a joke, but I had enough. I told her that it was not funny and that she needed to stop using my personal belongings without permission. I said it was disrespectful and a violation of my privacy.\n\nThe rest of the office heard the commotion and some of my coworkers agreed with me, while others said I was overreacting and should let it go. Sarah hasn't spoken to me since, and the atmosphere has become tense. A few coworkers have even suggested that I owe Sarah an apology for embarrassing her in front of everyone.\n\nSo, AITA for telling my coworker to stop using my personal belongings?", "created_utc": 1683369844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139jd3m/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_to_stop_using_my/", "score": 2145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The way you describe it, it sounds like you used properly clear, firm language and there could be no question about the situation, but if you hinted and were gentle about this, it could\u2019ve been an instance culture conflict - some folks are raised to understand that subtle hints are the polite and proper way to communicate, while others are raised with more direct communication, and I\u2019ve ended up on the wrong side of that kind of conflict a time or two.  Ask vs guess culture is another instance of this - I was raised in ask culture, where it\u2019s appropriate to ask for things pretty directly, where in guess culture you\u2019re supposed to hint politely and hope the other person will offer, because it\u2019s rude to refuse a direct request.  I trampled a friend\u2019s feelings pretty badly because I would ask about doing things together or borrowing things, and she was raised in guess culture and felt uncomfortable saying no until she was so frustrated she blew up at me (this happened in high school, and was really my first introduction to the idea that there was this cultural divide, but I was solidly an adult before I read a piece that laid it all out in a way I could clearly understand what my friend\u2019s expectations were back then - at the time, I just trimmed waaaay back on what I asked or suggested, and didn\u2019t really understand why she didn\u2019t ask for or suggest what she wanted more clearly)", "NTA - I would have exploded over the dish stealing.

She\u2019s clever and interesting\u201d\u2026 great!   \n\n\nExcept\u2026. Within a couple of weeks she\u2019d joined an after work club I went to, she was inviting herself around for my group dinners (twice a week I\u2019d have mates over for dinner in my inner city pad, after work), and she started to arrive and deliberately miss the last bus home\u2026 asking to stay on my pull out sofa bed (and saying it\u2019s fine, don\u2019t bother making it up, I can just crash in your bed with you - nope never!)  \nOne night I had a hot date coming, it was also a party with booze, bad movies and fun\u2026 and she showed up (uninvited, but it was a party, with a wider group\u2026 whatever, I wasn\u2019t going to have a scene). (She knew I had a date there that night, and no, she and I were never intimate or romantic in any way)\u2026 she went into my room and through my wardrobe and came out in my clothes - a corset and jeans - matching outfit to what I was wearing\u2026. Um..>!   \n\n\nI was talking to a friend/colleague at work the next day, complaining about this and she turned to me and said \u201cYou have to break up with Sarah\u2026\u201d and I was like \u201cWTH? I\u2019m not DATING her!\u201d And my friend said \u201cNo, but she\u2019s dating you\u201d. Sheesh. She was right. Sarah was dating me, and I was oblivious.   \n\n\n(And my friend was very right, because as soon as I tried to explain to Sarah we were just friends, nothing more, and I was seeing someone and wasn\u2019t interested in her she slammed out of my life with a speed that was breathtaking.
