You should cut contact with your sister,  this relationship only benefits her when she wants and how she wants.  It's not worth your mental health or your mom's health to have such a bad relative being a mean judgmental witch.", "Nta. Your sister created her situation by lying and using y'all.  If she doesnt want to have a productive relationship then cut her off. Shes grown and needs to learn there are consquences to your actions.", "NTA, You\u2019ve unfortunately described a very abusive family dynamic. Your mother was right about distancing yourself, I think your only mistake was contacting your sister with this information. Sometimes people aren\u2019t capable of reciprocating the kindness we treat them with. It is not our responsibility to accept that abuse just because they are family. Family doesn\u2019t desert one another. They also don\u2019t spread vicious/destructive lies about people they should love and protect. If family counseling is something you have access to I\u2019d recommend you and your Mom go without your sister or grandmother(s). People who are manipulative and deceptive on this level have to want to change and feel bad for their behavior. They haven\u2019t indicated they\u2019re willing to take a shred of accountability. From what you\u2019ve described your sister is only interested in being able to use your Mom when she needs her and attack her character for sport the rest of the time. That\u2019s not someone it\u2019s healthy to be in contact with. I would seriously consider cutting off contact with them. I\u2019d also recommend reading up on codependency. The dynamic you\u2019ve described can create codependent coping mechanisms in victims of this sort of abuse. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve both experienced such hardship and mistreatment. No one deserves that from people who are supposed to be your family. I wish you and your mom health and healing!", "INFO: Why did your sister and grandma make up lies about your mum? \n\nThere seems to be a lot missing, or you might not have known everything at the time since you were so young. But I think it really depends on the relationship between your mum and the others, my mum always came off as an angel to me until I grew up and spoke to the people she didn\u2019t like and realised half truths don\u2019t tell a whole story. I don\u2019t think its wise to mediate something that we dont understand", "Thank you for your answer!! \nI\u2019ve tried so many times to just cut the ties, but it is so hard, because no matter what she is still my sister, and I would like to make sure that she understands why this is happening and that the working on the relationship shouldn\u2019t only be one sided", "This is a problem - my grandma or my sister never told me why they said those things, but my dad told me a couple years ago that he would come to visit us, just to check if we were taken care of, because my grandma and my sister told him things.\nHe was pretty upset, because he told me that he had to believe them and go check because we are his kids and he cares about us.\nI tried asking my sister and my grandmother, they never answered, and always just changed the topic, or told me that I was just imagining this happening", "Also my mom has always been kind to all.\nShe took care of my grandma, she took her around the world with her because at the time we could afford that. With my sister as well, both my parents love her very much, and my mom had to go through a lot with my sister, since my sister\u2019s dad left them when she was a baby, and my mom had to fend for herself and my sister.", "Is anyone close to your mum (other than you)? Or does it seem like everyone ends up in an argument with her eventually?", "Me, my brother, even my dad and all her friends are very close to her, and we barely have arguments", "I feel like you're trying to lead OP down a path that isn't there, based on your own prejudices, perhaps towards mother's. Someone can have two different people be horrible to them and it not mean they have BPD or whatever it is you're insinuating. \n\nI get where you're coming from but I don't think it's food.", "I\u2019m very sorry you have to deal with this. Sometimes people aren\u2019t going to budge, and it\u2019s ok to take your mums side. I hope things get better, and I hope your sister and grandma one day see what they missed out on. NTA, good luck!", "Just trying to paint a bigger picture is all. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s leading anywhere and that\u2019s ok. My questions could have had answers that were key to the story but it seems not, and that\u2019s perfectly ok :)"]}
