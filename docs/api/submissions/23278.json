I'm Janice I'm your new neighbor so good to see you, I just wanted to introduce myself I live right next door to you with my daughter and we just moved in etc\" and then she shaked my hand and walked off. All good. The owner of that house is named \"Gary\" he's a great guy, he's in his 50's. And I've known him for ages. So he usually rents out that house and so these are his new tenants. He used to live in that house, but for the past few years he's been renting it out.\n\nSo everyday, around 6-7PM I go take a dive in my pool. I take my shirt off just wearing my swimming trunks, and go right in my pool and start swimming. Everyday, I see a lady sitting on her balcony just watch me swim. I don't care, or so just mind my business swimming/or I might sit on the chair on the pool just relaxing, minding my own business. \n\nYesterday, while I was swimming at 7PM, I hear a loud banging knocking noise on my door.

And I know how this goes\". I then told her \"Janice, I'm not luring anybody and Im minding my business\". She then said \"I don't care about all that, but listen put some clothes on and stop swimming at your pool we have children over here\".
