After a long day of work etc. I love taking a dive in my pool (In my backyard) and have a nice swim for a while. I just find it soothing, relaxing and helps me sleep better and I feel much better and it's something I look forward to every day. \n\nA week or so, while I was walking my dog out a lady came up to me and said \"oh Hi! I'm Janice I'm your new neighbor so good to see you, I just wanted to introduce myself I live right next door to you with my daughter and we just moved in etc\" and then she shaked my hand and walked off. All good. The owner of that house is named \"Gary\" he's a great guy, he's in his 50's. And I've known him for ages. So he usually rents out that house and so these are his new tenants. He used to live in that house, but for the past few years he's been renting it out.\n\nSo everyday, around 6-7PM I go take a dive in my pool. I take my shirt off just wearing my swimming trunks, and go right in my pool and start swimming. Everyday, I see a lady sitting on her balcony just watch me swim. I don't care, or so just mind my business swimming/or I might sit on the chair on the pool just relaxing, minding my own business. \n\nYesterday, while I was swimming at 7PM, I hear a loud banging knocking noise on my door. I get up from my pool dry myself put a pair of clothes on and go to the front door and say \"Hey Janice, how's it going?\" she said \"What's going on is you're trying to lure my innocent daughter into your trap. And I know how this goes\". I then told her \"Janice, I'm not luring anybody and Im minding my business\". She then said \"I don't care about all that, but listen put some clothes on and stop swimming at your pool we have children over here\". I then just say \"It's my pool, and it's my property Janice, I'm not doing anything\" and I just go inside and close the door. \n\nAITA?

My question is what does Janice and her daughter do when they got a public pool? Also Janice and her daughter doesn\u2019t have to watch you swim that\u2019s kind of creepy, what is this a lifetime movie where we watch people swim by themselves???", "Unless you are doing anything illegal, there is nothing wrong with enjoying your pool on your property.

There's only one solution: start wearing the skimpiest speedo you can find.", "NTA.\n\nGet some cameras and have them pointed at the pool and you front door. \n\nIf your neighbor does this again, report them to the police for harassment, give the footage of them at your door and footage of you just swimming and minding your own business.", "NTA \n\nWow the cheek of it! I'd be tempted to skinnydip in future!! (Seriously that is bad bad advice, don't do that, in some states that is illegal if minors can see you)\n\nYou can use your pool how you like and Janice (I'm picturing the one from Friends) can keep her daughter busy when you are swimming if she feels her daughter is being inappropriate.", "Why are you even posting this here?

Janice is out of her fucking mind.", "NTA. \n\nI'd be prepared for more of this if I were you, though.  Janices don't tend to go back into the woodwork once they've crawled out of it.", "NTA.  Does she set an alarm so she can be on her balcony when you go swimming? Have you even SEEN her daughter? Definitely tell Gary.", "I wouldn\u2019t say that it is creepy. I used to enjoy watching people (men or women) doing laps because it was very relaxing.", "I fully second this.", "You need to tell Gary his tenant is harassing you. I\u2019d also file a police report to create a paper trail, you have no idea what accusations this woman may dream up.", "The woman does not sound like she is in her right mind.\n\nYou have the right to swim in your pool.  you are not violating any decency laws.\n\nYou might start documenting everything that happens with this person.

That would be considered discriminatory in even the most conservative state since women are freely allowed to wear bikini bottoms and even thongs in public. A private swimming facility could prohibit it, but that's it.\n\nWhere I live, you can be nude on your property all you want as long as you're not aroused nor doing it with the intent to harass. If Janice was my neighbor though, I'd probably stop all of the nude sunbathing I do since she'd obviously claim I was harassing and trying to seduce her poor innocent child.\n\nEdit: I was slightly wrong. You can even be nude in public and it's not considered public indecency where I live unless you commit a \"sexual intrusion\" (not sure what that is), commit a sexual act or are nude \"with the intent of arousing the sexual desire\" of yourself or or another person.", "I\u2019ve lived here for 30+ years and can tell you that is not true.
