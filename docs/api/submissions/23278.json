After a long day of work etc. I love taking a dive in my pool (In my backyard) and have a nice swim for a while. I just find it soothing, relaxing and helps me sleep better and I feel much better and it's something I look forward to every day. \n\nA week or so, while I was walking my dog out a lady came up to me and said \"oh Hi! I'm Janice I'm your new neighbor so good to see you, I just wanted to introduce myself I live right next door to you with my daughter and we just moved in etc\" and then she shaked my hand and walked off. All good. The owner of that house is named \"Gary\" he's a great guy, he's in his 50's. And I've known him for ages. So he usually rents out that house and so these are his new tenants. He used to live in that house, but for the past few years he's been renting it out.\n\nSo everyday, around 6-7PM I go take a dive in my pool. I take my shirt off just wearing my swimming trunks, and go right in my pool and start swimming. Everyday, I see a lady sitting on her balcony just watch me swim. I don't care, or so just mind my business swimming/or I might sit on the chair on the pool just relaxing, minding my own business. \n\nYesterday, while I was swimming at 7PM, I hear a loud banging knocking noise on my door. I get up from my pool dry myself put a pair of clothes on and go to the front door and say \"Hey Janice, how's it going?\" she said \"What's going on is you're trying to lure my innocent daughter into your trap. And I know how this goes\". I then told her \"Janice, I'm not luring anybody and Im minding my business\". She then said \"I don't care about all that, but listen put some clothes on and stop swimming at your pool we have children over here\". I then just say \"It's my pool, and it's my property Janice, I'm not doing anything\" and I just go inside and close the door. \n\nAITA?
