I've seen a lot of comments on this thread and I have a lot of opinions on this subject that would amount to a wordy novel. As someone who lives in Colorado, I can attest that it is pretty expensive to live here. OP is well within their rights to ask their adult child and partner to pay towards living expenses. The child has other options than living with her parents if she doesn't like it. But OP needs a serious reality check if they think that 30K is a lot. So let me help you out: \n\nThe \"low income\" apartments in my area go for $900/month for a 1 bed 1 bath. You have to qualify for these apartments, and they can vary in quality and safety. Groceries, gas, and utilities have gone up significantly in the last couple years, blame whatever you want for that. I know plenty of people making 100K/year who are still living paycheck to paycheck, not because they're irresponsible, but because that amount of money does not have the same value it did 20 years ago. \n\nNow keep in mind that being poor is fucking expensive. Check out the Boots Theory of socioeconomic unfairness, and this can give you a good picture of what I'm talking about. If your daughter and her fiance are blowing all their money on weed, video games, not saving anything, and they do nothing all day then yeah they're immature and need to learn some financial responsibility. But be honest with yourself: how many people who are 20 years old or older, WANT or LIKE living with their parents? I don't know any.  I do know some that do it out of necessity or to reach a financial goal with every intention of leaving ASAP based on the reason.  Generally young people don't actually like mooching off their parents, they want to be independent. \n\nI live in a house where there are 4 adults and we split the rent, and I still don't have enough left over every month after necessities to really save money. At the rate I'm going, I will never be able to afford a home in the town I grew up in. When my parents bought their first house out here they paid 60K for it in 1985. That exact house is now worth over 450K, even though no significant updates have been made to it. So tell me, OP, genuinely, how much buying power do you THINK 30K has? Has your daughter expressed interest in moving out, but talked with you about the serious hurdles involved in that? Or maybe why she's living at home, if maybe for another reason? \n\nAgain, you're well within your rights to ask them to contribute financially to the house.

(I bet I sound like such an entitled child expecting everything served to me on a silver platter)\n\nAlso. Calling you a boomer, kinda shitty. She's right about it but I chalk that one up as disrespectful. that comes from raising, whoever brought her up likely shares some of the blame there. She says nobody pays rent to their parents? That's entitled sounding, she's not necessarily *right* everybody's situation is different of course. Plenty of people pay rent to their parents, plenty of people live rent free for both valid *and* shitty reasons. They're paying for their food and personal items and not dragging down your purse raiding the fridge and finishing the milk or whatever, that's something. If you want them to help with electric and water and heat, that's completely valid, I don't have any problem with that.\n\nIt's the way you're going about it and your excuses. You say you paid rent, what portion of your monthly take home pay did your first apartment cost? How much was that take home pay, how close was it to the median income in your area? You're going to \"teach her responsibility\"? Didn't you have 20 years to do that already? Or \"teach them how rent works\" they know how rent *works*, but get on Zillow or apartment finder or rent dot com, look at rentals in your area, 30k is 2,500 a month. Go see what apartments in your area cost. The historic general rule of thumb has been usually don't spend more than \u00bc  of month's salary on housing. That works out to 625 bucks a month. Go see if you can find a place *you* would accept living in for that price instead of telling them they should rent a spider infested dump. \n\nAnd that's if you're talking about 30k net. Does he *bring home* 30k? \n\n\"If you make $30,000 a year you will be taxed $4,985. That means that your net pay will be $25,015 per year, or $2,085 per month. Your average tax rate is 16.6% and your marginal tax rate is 25.2%.\"\n\nSo 25k, thats 2k a month. Going by the \"no more than a quarter\" rule, (which, again, has historically been the general consensus that financial advisors would say is not over extending yourself)  try to find a place you'd be happy living in in your area for 500 a month. Gas, groceries, car insurance, cell phone, for 500 a month, they're likely not going to find a place with in unit washer and dryer so laundromat, other incidentals, need to buy clothes every now and then, do they have their own furniture? Or would they need to furnish a place? Used furniture is fine, free furniture is gross, some form of entertainment, can't just sit and stare at a white wall during all of your non-working hours. Maybe not every streaming service but maybe one.\n\nGenerally (and I don't know what your parents were like but) part of the American dream has been wanting your kids to do better and have more chances than you did at the same age. Based on what you've said, I really don't think you understand the obstacles today's 20 year olds are staring down. What year did you enter the work force? Because back then, all you had to show up for 40 hours a week, do your part and for that, you were handed a reasonable living wage on a silver platter. Did you attend college? Did you have to do a side hustle? Did you have to drive people around or deliver food on nights and weekends? Did you ever have to set up your own store to sell jewelry or anything hand made? Did you ever have to set up your own porn channel and market all over social media? How much did your first car close and what portion of your annual income did it cost?\n\nIs your daughter in school? Do either of them have plans to attend higher education? If so, I'm only 36 but I do agree with what some people think of as \"boomer mindset\" that a college degree needs to be marketable, I do think there are some completely nonsense silly degrees but I won't go into it. If she goes to college, would you help financially? Or would she have to do it all on grants and loans? How much do you make and what's your net worth? If you are in a pretty good place financially, she is going to be eligible for much less or possibly no need-based pell grants. There's no way anybody is going to be able to pay for college on 30k a year.\n\nYou want to charge her rent? Go ahead, fine. I'm taking all bets, even money, you say shit like \"my roof, my rules\" and that's fine, whatever. But yeah, you're out of touch.
