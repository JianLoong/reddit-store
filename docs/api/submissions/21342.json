This never l bothered me as I am quite an introverted person. Anyways skipping to my birthday. We have been planning this party for a long time as I have been really depressed the past couple years and this was my first big gathering with all my friends and family who were also there to support my recovery. \n\nI was sending out the invites and was really excited. We were ordering in pizzas and KFC which are my two absolute favourites. Anyways I tell everyone in the group-chat that we will be ordering this and everyone is excited but then Leah messages and says she \"can't have that\" because she is Vegan. She then went on to say it was disrespectful that I wasn't being inclusive to everyone. In private messages she started going on about how it was really rude of me to not have asked before organising food and that I was \"discriminating against her being a vegan\" so I got really stressed and didn't know what to do. I then said I would order her some food separately from a Vegan place and that I would pay and she went quiet. \n\nThe day before the party I got a message in the group from her saying \"@everyone Can't wait to catch up with you all this weekend. I have some exciting news of my own I would like to share!\" Confused about this, I message her personally and asked what this was about as I didn't quite understand as to why she had to announce it on MY birthday. It also pissed me off how she was texting the groupchat as if she was the one who was organising the party. We have quite a lot of mutual friends but at the end of the day it was MY GROUPCHAT and she was treating it like it was some mass gathering for her.\n \nLeah said she was \"planning on telling everyone about her pregnancy\". I was shocked. Not only did I feel like she was purposefully trying to ruin my birthday but I was even more hurt she didn't even ask me first. After all it was MY birthday party..\nI told her I did not want her to announce it on my birthday and that I found it really rude of her to not have asked me first. She then went OFF at me and started complaining about how this was her \"only opportunity to do it\" as \"everyone would be there\" and the \"timing was so perfect\" and that I had \"ruined her plan\" and that I am a\n\"selfish and bad friend\" for not being happy for her. She then said she can do \"whatever the f she wants and I can't stop her from announcing it\" I was too stressed that I sent her a text uninviting her to my party and then blocked her. All day I got calls and texts from her family saying I was \"selfish and rude\" and that I \"was narcissistic\" and that I was a \"bad friend\". They all basically called me am asshole for uninviting her and for being really \"mean\" to her too. All these texts made me feel really guilty and like an asshole, so here I am reddit...

Or I would be petty and make an announcement and tag everyone invited about Leas pregnancy.", " NTA, this is your b-day one day a year when it's just about you. You're throwing a party, making all the plans. She has no right to take that from you. Sounds like early on she wanted you to feel guilty by causing an issue with the food. When you fixed that, she had to find another way to make it about her. NTA 100000% NTA. Keep her blocked, block her family. She doesn't sound like a real friend and, more like a person who needs YOU to make her feel more important in her unimportant life.", "You're NTA. Your ~~cousin~~ friend sounds insufferable and self absorbed. If you were as spiteful as I am, you would block her from the chat and tell everyone her news for her before your party.\n\nETA- okay, maybe I wouldn't announce the news. Bur I would block her from chat, uninvite her from the party, and reschedule it so she couldn't crash it.\n\nFurther edit- now I see you already did most of that. I hope you stand your ground.\n\nLast edit (I hope)- called her friend her cousin because... I have no excuse. Probably my mind merged this one with another post.", "Don\u2019t feel guilty about this person. If anyone is being narcissistic, it would be her. It\u2019s YOUR party, and you put in a very obvious boundary that she told you she planned on breaking. You preemptively told her that she wasn\u2019t welcome to the party. This makes you NTA.

The audacity to call you narcissistic when she's literally using your birthday party to announce her pregnancy and somehow you're the bad friend? Also, if she truly was a good friend, she would know what you like and not only be happy for you to be celebrating your birthday with the people who love and support you and quietly get her own food instead of acting like a spoilt brat and throwing a hissy fit. Don't let her family guilt you into feeling bad about uninviting her or make you doubt what a good friend you can be to people. Instead of pointing fingers at others, they should take a look at what their own daughter's up to. All I can say is that maybe instead of blocking her immediately you could have sent a clear message that what she's doing is not nice and you would rather not surround yourself with such negativity. You don't have to of course, this would just get the message across that she can't walk over you like that.", "NTA. After reading all this AITA posts, I came to realize that I'm really mean because I would send a group message saying, \"Atention all, Leah is pregnant! Congratulations, Leah!!\" But that's just me being mean.\n\nThis Leah is not your friend. A true friend cares about you and your feelings, but she doesn't give a sh*t about your feelings. I know it sucks and it hurts, but the most important person in your life is yourself (as it should be)\n\nIf she wants to announce her pregnancy, she can organize her own party. \n\nShe is mean rude.

And frankly the rudeness regarding the food already tells me enough to know she\u2019s a very entitled sort of person, it\u2019s your birthday but she wants the spotlight (without asking you first). \n\nYou might well be getting a toxic person out of your life.", "Announce it on social media LOLOL.

Where do they all come from?\n\nShe'll come to your party anyway, so you'd better arrange for door security.\n\nIncidentally, was she always like this?
