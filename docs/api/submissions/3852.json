Last night I craved for a chicken sandwich with chilli and I asked my mother in law whether she wanted any. She said no she wasn't hungry and since my husband doesn't eat at that time, I only made one.\n\nI quickly gobbled it up and when my mother in law came into the kitchen again, the plate was already wiped clean. She asked me in shock you're done that fast?! I was pretty embarrassed and told her it's my favorite. Then she said and you didn't think to at least offer people staying in the house with you a bite? I was confused and told her but you said you weren't hungry and Jake (my husband) doesn't eat at this hour. \n\nShe said you didn't think to store some in the fridge in case I DO get hungry?! I told her I'm sorry I really didn't think that far ahead. I'll make a new one. But then I remembered that we were all out of chilli and sheepishly told her imma go buy some. She told me not to bother but I insisted. \n\nBut even after looking at several convenience stores, I couldn't find the brand I was looking for and since it was nearly midnight by then, I didn't have many options. I called Jake and asked him what I should do and he told me to just get one from a snack near us.\n\nWhen I got home though and brought it to my mother in law, she refused to eat it and said I told you to forget it I don't eat takeout. She insisted she didn't want it nor did she want anything else as she wasn't hungry, that she had just smelled the chilli earlier and wanted a bite. \n\nI told her okay if you need anything let me know. I went back to the kitchen and..... ate that sandwich too. The next day, Jake and I wake up to find mother in law gone with a text sent to my husband that says she won't be putting her foot in our house ever again for the amount of disrespect I showed her. Apparently she did get hungry later and went looking for the sandiwch and couldn't find it.\n\nJake was livid that I ate that one too and told me this is my fault and I should go with him to apologize to her. I got angry too and told him why couldn't she have just asked directly instead of going around all these circles in the first place?

Now, if it were me, I'd think \"*here we go again - she'll say she doesn't want it, but will come back for it\"*. At most, I'd eat half and make sure to leave her something.\n\nThis wasn't \"being a mindreader\", but more like \"I've seen this move before\".\n\nBut you left her exactly nothing, knowing that this is the game she plays.

You were almost entirely in the right, but I\u2019m side eyeing you for eating that second sandwich - could your really not have left it in case she changed her mind, especially since you knew there was nothing else to eat unless she cooked? Both your husband and you are in the wrong for that. If you have guests, you should have food they can access and eat.

The hard thing, often very hard, is how to refuse to tolerate bad behavior without invalidating those feelings.\n\n\nI'd suggest opening a line of communication when things have calmed down some. You can honestly, I assume, apologize for the fact that she felt disrespected, that it wasn't intended, and in fact it wasn't about her at all. And you can push back (probably gently, given what she sounds like) that working on improving communication both ways would be helpful. For the second sandwich, not only did she decline it, she implied she wouldn't eat it even if she was hungry, which she claimed not to be. You can offer to compromise in the future by putting aside some food in the house that is solely for her, or at least the ingredients for a few of her favorite snacks or something, maybe? \n\nOr if your husband is ok with a lessened relationship with her, you can send a note saying you're sorry she felt disrespected and will try to fix that by respecting her decision to never come see her again.", "NTA.

We don\u2019t eat donuts so I keep a box in the freezer and pull it out an hour before she arrives.   Find her food weakness and exploit it. \n\n3. Stop offering.  Just tell her to help herself to whatever she wants.  \n\n4. Redirect her complaints.  She wants attention.  Be zen.  Remind her that she\u2019s welcome to help herself or ask her son to get her some food.  \n\nAnd tell your husband to apologize to you for expecting you to bow and cater to his mom.
