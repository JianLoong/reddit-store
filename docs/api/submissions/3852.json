Last night I craved for a chicken sandwich with chilli and I asked my mother in law whether she wanted any. She said no she wasn't hungry and since my husband doesn't eat at that time, I only made one.\n\nI quickly gobbled it up and when my mother in law came into the kitchen again, the plate was already wiped clean. She asked me in shock you're done that fast?! I was pretty embarrassed and told her it's my favorite. Then she said and you didn't think to at least offer people staying in the house with you a bite? I was confused and told her but you said you weren't hungry and Jake (my husband) doesn't eat at this hour. \n\nShe said you didn't think to store some in the fridge in case I DO get hungry?! I told her I'm sorry I really didn't think that far ahead. I'll make a new one. But then I remembered that we were all out of chilli and sheepishly told her imma go buy some. She told me not to bother but I insisted. \n\nBut even after looking at several convenience stores, I couldn't find the brand I was looking for and since it was nearly midnight by then, I didn't have many options. I called Jake and asked him what I should do and he told me to just get one from a snack near us.\n\nWhen I got home though and brought it to my mother in law, she refused to eat it and said I told you to forget it I don't eat takeout. She insisted she didn't want it nor did she want anything else as she wasn't hungry, that she had just smelled the chilli earlier and wanted a bite. \n\nI told her okay if you need anything let me know. I went back to the kitchen and..... ate that sandwich too. The next day, Jake and I wake up to find mother in law gone with a text sent to my husband that says she won't be putting her foot in our house ever again for the amount of disrespect I showed her. Apparently she did get hungry later and went looking for the sandiwch and couldn't find it.\n\nJake was livid that I ate that one too and told me this is my fault and I should go with him to apologize to her. I got angry too and told him why couldn't she have just asked directly instead of going around all these circles in the first place? He ignored me and grabbed his jacket and keys and left.\n\nAm I really in the wrong here?", "created_utc": 1670083043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbjgln/aita_for_not_leaving_my_mother_in_law_anything_to/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You asked her if she wanted anything, she said no, changed her mind probably knowing you already ate and then had the nerve to still throw a tantrum after you went out trying to make it up to her. I\u2019m shocked you even did this much. She was clearly looking for a reason to start something", "MiL seems uber confused. She wanted you to make her a sandwich just in case she got hungry later?

Passive-aggressive BS doesn't deserve respect.", "NTA - She probably left so she could hit the drive-thru.", "NTA its not your fault since you took her at her word every step of the way. \n\nShe said she wasn't hungry so you made enough for one.

He is solely responsible for any shopping, cooking and entertaining for his guest.", "ESH - and I'm ready for the down arrows.\n\nAfter she said she \"didn't want\" the first sandwich - but then went looking for it anyway - you knew that that's what she does... says \"*no*\" at the moment, but then looks for it later. (my hunch is it's not the first time you've heard her do this).\n\nSo then you went and got her a second sandwich. She said the same thing - she \"didn't want\" it. Now, if it were me, I'd think \"*here we go again - she'll say she doesn't want it, but will come back for it\"*. At most, I'd eat half and make sure to leave her something.\n\nThis wasn't \"being a mindreader\", but more like \"I've seen this move before\".\n\nBut you left her exactly nothing, knowing that this is the game she plays. I'm OK if you eat both, and there's other stuff around. If it's the case that there was nothing more to eat in the house.... yeah ESH. If there's plenty of other stuff for her to eat, then N T A.\n\nWhy isn't it your husband's responsibility to make sure there's food for his mother?", "Now did you really have to eat the second one????? I still think NTA, you\u2019re just greedy lol.", "ESH she most of all because of the ridiculous mind games. Your husband is next for not trying to see your side of things. You were almost entirely in the right, but I\u2019m side eyeing you for eating that second sandwich - could your really not have left it in case she changed her mind, especially since you knew there was nothing else to eat unless she cooked? Both your husband and you are in the wrong for that. If you have guests, you should have food they can access and eat.
