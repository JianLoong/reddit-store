Last night I craved for a chicken sandwich with chilli and I asked my mother in law whether she wanted any. She said no she wasn't hungry and since my husband doesn't eat at that time, I only made one.\n\nI quickly gobbled it up and when my mother in law came into the kitchen again, the plate was already wiped clean. She asked me in shock you're done that fast?! I was pretty embarrassed and told her it's my favorite. Then she said and you didn't think to at least offer people staying in the house with you a bite? I was confused and told her but you said you weren't hungry and Jake (my husband) doesn't eat at this hour. \n\nShe said you didn't think to store some in the fridge in case I DO get hungry?! I told her I'm sorry I really didn't think that far ahead. I'll make a new one. But then I remembered that we were all out of chilli and sheepishly told her imma go buy some. She told me not to bother but I insisted. \n\nBut even after looking at several convenience stores, I couldn't find the brand I was looking for and since it was nearly midnight by then, I didn't have many options. I called Jake and asked him what I should do and he told me to just get one from a snack near us.\n\nWhen I got home though and brought it to my mother in law, she refused to eat it and said I told you to forget it I don't eat takeout. She insisted she didn't want it nor did she want anything else as she wasn't hungry, that she had just smelled the chilli earlier and wanted a bite. \n\nI told her okay if you need anything let me know. I went back to the kitchen and..... ate that sandwich too. The next day, Jake and I wake up to find mother in law gone with a text sent to my husband that says she won't be putting her foot in our house ever again for the amount of disrespect I showed her. Apparently she did get hungry later and went looking for the sandiwch and couldn't find it.\n\nJake was livid that I ate that one too and told me this is my fault and I should go with him to apologize to her. I got angry too and told him why couldn't she have just asked directly instead of going around all these circles in the first place?

Now, if it were me, I'd think \"*here we go again - she'll say she doesn't want it, but will come back for it\"*. At most, I'd eat half and make sure to leave her something.\n\nThis wasn't \"being a mindreader\", but more like \"I've seen this move before\".\n\nBut you left her exactly nothing, knowing that this is the game she plays.

You were almost entirely in the right, but I\u2019m side eyeing you for eating that second sandwich - could your really not have left it in case she changed her mind, especially since you knew there was nothing else to eat unless she cooked? Both your husband and you are in the wrong for that. If you have guests, you should have food they can access and eat.

The hard thing, often very hard, is how to refuse to tolerate bad behavior without invalidating those feelings.\n\n\nI'd suggest opening a line of communication when things have calmed down some. You can honestly, I assume, apologize for the fact that she felt disrespected, that it wasn't intended, and in fact it wasn't about her at all. And you can push back (probably gently, given what she sounds like) that working on improving communication both ways would be helpful. For the second sandwich, not only did she decline it, she implied she wouldn't eat it even if she was hungry, which she claimed not to be. You can offer to compromise in the future by putting aside some food in the house that is solely for her, or at least the ingredients for a few of her favorite snacks or something, maybe? \n\nOr if your husband is ok with a lessened relationship with her, you can send a note saying you're sorry she felt disrespected and will try to fix that by respecting her decision to never come see her again.", "NTA.

I\u2019m sorry but this is hilarious. She really be expecting you to be a mind reader here. That, or she doesn\u2019t like you so she\u2019s trying to make you out to be the bad guy.

You are not responsible for guessing what others really mean when they give mixed messages.  You went way beyond what a typical person would do by trying.

Expecting you to just magically know that is beyond crazy.  \n\nI live with someone who reflexively says \"no thank you\" when I ask if he wants something I am making. About half the time it all of a sudden sounds good to him about 30-60 min later. Now, I could always make extra, but I do not want to encourage that behavior, so I don't make extra.

But it\u2019s my MIL so I have to at least try to get along for my family\u2019s sake.  Here are a few tricks to I\u2019ve learned:\n\n1.  Ask your husband to find out what she likes and then stock that in the fridge.  It\u2019s always there for her to nibble on. \n\n2.  Stock things she\u2019ll never admit to wanting but will always eat.  With my MIL it\u2019s donuts.  She has never asked for a donut, and will never admit to wanting a donut, but when she leaves I find half the box is empty.  We don\u2019t eat donuts so I keep a box in the freezer and pull it out an hour before she arrives.   Find her food weakness and exploit it. \n\n3. Stop offering.  Just tell her to help herself to whatever she wants.  \n\n4. Redirect her complaints.  She wants attention.  Be zen.  Remind her that she\u2019s welcome to help herself or ask her son to get her some food.  \n\nAnd tell your husband to apologize to you for expecting you to bow and cater to his mom.  Next time he can do a midnight chili run.  \n\nNTA", "NTA", "I got halfway through and realized you deal with insufferable human beings.\n\nNTA.\n\nAnd consider running far away.", "NTA, but you made things worse by trying to fix it. You lost when you offered to make a new one, that makes it look like you're assuming the guilt for it. \n\nYou offered, she declined. You have no further obligation. If she wants something after that, it's her responsibility. What are you supposed to do, disbelieve her when she says anything at all in case she changes her mind? If she says she doesn't like chocolate cake, are you supposed to bake her a chocolate cake just in case she decides she does like it now? What if she hates pets? Are you supposed to buy her a dog, a cat, a bird and a lizard in case she decides she likes one of them? It's ridiculous and so is she.", "Wow! Your mother-in-law is a manipulating, gas lighting piece of work. Does she have a mental illness? She sure acts like she does. NTA", "NTA.  And your MIL sounds like a cat  LOL  I don't want what you have until it's gone. Then you offered me something again, and I don't want that either, but now I want it because it's gone. And I'm mad because I'm hungry but I won't eat anything you have.", "So she *does* it take out? Looks like she was just waiting for any little thing to cause this scene. A bummer you are now related to this person and their shitty son. NTA", "NTA This makes me want to take my MIL to lunch. Because she would never act this way. He should be standing up to her. She seems like the type that will never be pleased.", "You're wrong because you believed what she told you?? What? NTA!", "\\> The next day, Jake and I wake up to find mother in law gone with a text   \nsent to my husband that says she won't be putting her foot in our house   \never again for the amount of disrespect I showed her.\n\nWow! Easy win! NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry, but why exactly are you running all over town trying to satisfy this whining, entitled nightmare of a person?\n\nWere her hands broken? She\u2019s incapable of making food for herself?", "This is a whole lot of words for \"I asked if she was hungry and wanted something to eat. She said no.

No, you were right, and you can not read minds or know anything in advance. and why didn't your husband stand with you in this, is beyond me too.", "You went to multiple stores late at night and then she had the audacity to refuse the sandwich you bought her because she \"doesn't eat takeout\". But yet she gets mad when you wat the sandwich she refused to eat in the first place.

This is so ridiculous it\u2019s funny. Each time either one kicks off at you, say that you\u2019re going to keep believing what they say.

People are always joking how when they were kids their moms would complain that no one ever helps them around the house but when the kids ask if anything needs to be done, she tells them no. Apparently it means \"Yes but I shouldn't have to ask\" but if you do it without asking, she gets upset if they don't do it exactly the way she wants them to.

Again.\n\nYou also dignify it further by allowing your partner to entertain it. \u201cI\u2019m not a mind reader. And I won\u2019t be walked over.
