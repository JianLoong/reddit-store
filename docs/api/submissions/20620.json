Before officially moving in, all he requested of me was to pay 40% of the monthly mortgage and utilities payment and to take turns buying groceries. I gladly agreed and have consistently done that. I\u2019ve also been paying for everyday necessities such as toilet paper, soap, papers towels, etc and we use my car 95% of the time because he\u2019s pointed out that my car is more gas efficient (I always pay for gas too). I estimate these extra monthly costs to be around $400-500 and never complain.\n\nSince the beginning of our relationship, he\u2019s shared his home renovation plans starting with the bathrooms which he estimates to cost at least $10k. I like the idea because the improvements would be nice to have (floor-to-ceiling marble, glass shower doors, new windows to add natural night). There are currently no issues with the bathrooms but he insists we should get it done before we have kids and would like me to contribute.\n\nI\u2019ve always been upfront about my hesitation to contribute large amounts to a home I don\u2019t own because we aren\u2019t married yet and I\u2019m not on the deed. I also don\u2019t want to be like his ex who contributed to similar expenses and obviously that didn\u2019t work out. I told him it would give me comfort in knowing I contribute large amounts to something I also own and also shared my insecurity about ending up like his ex which he thinks is ridiculous because nothings guaranteed anyway (we could marry and divorce).\n\nHe recently had other improvements made to the house which cost over $10k. I didn\u2019t help pay or request these things but I have made previous comments about how these upgrades would be nice to have eventually.\n\nLately it seems my boyfriend has been building resentment towards me for not contributing more because he\u2019s made comments that my monthly mortgage contribution doesn\u2019t help a lot and that he feels like \u201che will always be alone in this\u201d. I\u2019ve told him I have no issues with contributing more once I\u2019m on the deed.\n\nEdit: \nThank you all for the comments received thus far. I\u2019m a little overwhelmed because I wasn\u2019t expecting this many. I wanted to provide a little clarification/extra info in response to some of the comments.\n\nThe 40% I pay is towards the mortgage and utility bills and by his calculations the total for that is $800. That plus the extra $400-500 I spend brings my monthly contribution to ~$1200-1300. According to a quick google search the average cost of a 1br apartment in my city is ~$1560. We\u2019re both aware that I pay less than the average and I\u2019ve expressed my gratitude for not having to pay that much anymore (I rented a 1br apartment before moving in and have done this for years). Also aware that utilities like electricity and gas can fluctuate so I\u2019m also grateful to pay a fixed amount towards that every month. Although we mostly use my car and I always pay for gas and the monthly city parking, he is very experienced and handy with cars and has done my oil changes so I have not had to bring my car in for maintenance at a shop.", "created_utc": 1687760046, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14j922c/aita_for_not_contributing_to_my_boyfriends_home/", "score": 1032, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's no reason you should pay for renovations on his house unless he puts your name on it too and you own part of it. I applaud you for having really good boundaries. \n\nEspecially since he makes so much more money than you, it sounds like you pay for too many things. Costs should be pretty equal, especially if you care for your partner enough to think about having a family with them. He should want to pay for half of what you pay for.

You are already going above and beyond in terms of splitting those costs.  But to expect you to share in the costs of upgrades to **HIS** house that increase the value of **HIS** house while your only benefit is though a nicer living space?  Ridiculous.\n\nYou are essentially a tenant in **HIS** house and apparently don't have any legal rights beyond what the law where you live dictates as one should he chose to kick you out of **HIS** house.

She had do have expected the same kind of returns you're being promised or there is no way she would have paid for renovations to **HIS** house. See this as the pattern it is and demand that he put everything in writing, including a return on your \"investments\" in **HIS** house before you give him any more money that you already do.  If he won't, you know the reality of where you stand and insist that monthly expenses be split 50/50 from now on too.\n\nI have a feeling you already know he will balk at that as well and if he does, GTFO as fast as you can before this USER continues to take advantage of the generosity you already show him on a monthly basis. \n\nTLDR--NTA with a previous pattern to support your position.", "NTA. Right now you are already paying more than him. 40% mortgage + only using your car and gas is not a fair split. Basically you pay half the mortgage while not having a house in return. Hell no to even paying for renovations without being a part owner. I would offe for him to make you part owner and then split all costs equally", "NTA\n\nNo, you're not the asshole for not contributing to your boyfriend's home renovations. You already agreed to pay your fair share of the mortgage, utilities, and everyday expenses. It's understandable that you have concerns about investing in a property you don't own and you've expressed those reservations. Your willingness to contribute more once you have ownership rights shows your commitment. It's important to have open and honest communication with your boyfriend to find a compromise that addresses both of your concerns.", "There are several ways to fix this, including marriage, domestic partnership or an equity sharing contract.

Generously & with love?\n\nOr would he make you justify every penny you spent of \u201chis\u201d money, so that you weren\u2019t able to buy new bras when your breasts changed size after feeding his babies - or afford to go for a coffee with friends once a month?

In other places , you have zero rights to the house. The second scenario is more common, but it's worth checking.   \n\n\nStep 2) Get yourself on the deed. If he wants to protect his initial investment in the house, that can be done. Visit a lawyer and divvy up the house.

I'd pay attention to his reaction. Splitting up and divorce are two separate scenarios. I don't see why you, with a dependable track record, asking to be put on the deed *while you are also contributing financially* and *planning on having his children* is \"ridiculous.\" And yes, nothing is guaranteed, but you still go into creating a family together with a sense of hope and goodwill. Perhaps going with him to a lawyer under the umbrella plan of creating a will (because you are planning to be parents after all) would be an eye opener for your partner and allow a third-party to explain the situation to him. Property becomes a whole 'nother subject when there is marriage (a legal contract) and/or children involved.\n\nFWIW: When my husband I got married he already owned his condo and therefore only his name was on the mortgage. He has a child and we found out that under the laws of our state, if he died the house would go to his child. But at the time his child was underage, so the house would go to his ex-wife. I asked him what the probably was of his ex-wife working with me to keep the house and he said none. He promptly put my name on the deed and when I told him this was huge because I'm not on the mortgage (it would have been costly for us at the time), he told me that knowing I would be cared for was important and his financial obligations to his son were and would continue to be met concurrently. I'll never forget my husband did that for me but I do think it made a difference that we had been together for awhile and I had contributed to the mortgage (\"rent\") and had shown I was dependable.
