If he \u201cfeels like he\u2019ll always be alone in this\u201d then he should formalize your partnership.", "Your boyfriend is wanting to take advantage of you. The fact that he blows off you paying 40% of his mortgage, despite him earning twice as much, is concerning. Tell him you legally are just a renter, and renters do not pay for home remodeling projects a landlord wants.   NTA", "NTA\n\nThe little detail of taking your car but not contributing toward gas says a lot about where his heart is. Sure it\u2019s more gas efficient, especially since it\u2019s completely free for him. He wants you to contribute big $$$ toward his house, but he won\u2019t contribute small $ toward gas, plus wear and tear. Small detail, but big \ud83d\udea9.\n\nAnd now you know why his ex is an ex, and why you should probably be one too. He\u2019s all take and no give.", "NTA. Don\u2019t pay for work on a house you have no legal claim to. Quite honestly you need to take a step back from paying the amount you do in my opinion. \n\nI could see covering/splitting utilities and groceries, but why are you paying any amount of money to a mortgage you\u2019re not on? And in addition to that you\u2019re the one putting all those miles on your car, and if he doesn\u2019t contribute to gas I\u2019m assuming he doesn\u2019t contribute to maintenance either. \n\nAnd you\u2019re not even the first partner he\u2019s pulled this shit with? Idk bestie, the red flags are starting to pile up.", "NTA - Your current contribution agreement is more than fair. Saying covering 40% of the monthly mortgage payment plus utilities among other things is not contributing enough is laughable. Certainly more fair than some arrangements I've seen r/ relationship advice that's for sure.\n\nYou can worry about paying for renovations after you get married.", "\"I told him it would give me comfort in knowing I contribute large amounts to something I also own and also shared my insecurity about ending up like his ex which he thinks is ridiculous because nothings guaranteed anyway (we could marry and divorce).\"\n\nThis right here is a red flag to me. If he is vocalizing the possibility, I find that to be a bad sign in a relationship. NTA. There's no reason you should pay for renovations on his house unless he puts your name on it too and you own part of it. I applaud you for having really good boundaries. \n\nEspecially since he makes so much more money than you, it sounds like you pay for too many things. Costs should be pretty equal, especially if you care for your partner enough to think about having a family with them. He should want to pay for half of what you pay for. You followed his stipulations for living there, which I think are pretty fair. You're basically paying rent until you are married and/or have your name on the house.", "NTA\n\nYou are being completely reasonable and rational.\n\nIf or when the two of you do get married, I suggest getting a prenuptial agreement.\n\nIt seems like your boyfriend has some slightly skewed perspective on what shared finances should look like.", "> I also don\u2019t want to be like his ex who contributed to similar expenses and obviously that didn\u2019t work out.\n\nSo he's already done this to an ex before and he thinks he can get away with it again? \n\n>he\u2019s made comments that my monthly mortgage contribution doesn\u2019t help a lot and that he feels like \u201che will always be alone in this\u201d.\n\nDon't fall for this crap. Don't pay more than 50% of his mortgage. There's two of you living there so the split shouldn't be more than that. NTA.", "NTA.  He increased his home value with those improvements, so he put that money in future him\u2019s pocket when he spent it on the house.  You shouldn\u2019t be expected to contribute to improving the value of his home unless you\u2019re benefitting from shared ownership (or sharing the increase in value).", "Lol. If he doesn\u2019t want to feel alone owning a home he can put you on the deed. NTA.", "NTA. Even if you did not mention the Ex, I would of said it\u2019s weird since you are not on the deed. But the whole ex paying, red flags everywhere!", "Nta. Seems like he wants you to pay for a lot of the house lol.", "NTA. One thing, wouldn't it be possible for him to just sell you equity in the house in exchange for your contribution? I mean, if the house is worth 500k, and you contribute 5k for renovations, then he'd sell you 1 % of the house in exchange for your contributions. Just put it in writing, with a proper contract. Then if you split up, you're guaranteed to get the money back, if you don't, well then all is well.", "NTA--He is and it's not even close.\n\nIt's perfectly fine for him to want someone living in **HIS** house to contribute some form of rent (your 40% of his mortgage) and to share the monthly expenses reasonably equally.  You are already going above and beyond in terms of splitting those costs.  But to expect you to share in the costs of upgrades to **HIS** house that increase the value of **HIS** house while your only benefit is though a nicer living space?  Ridiculous.\n\nYou are essentially a tenant in **HIS** house and apparently don't have any legal rights beyond what the law where you live dictates as one should he chose to kick you out of **HIS** house.  If you lived in an apartment and it needed upgrades, those would be your landlord's responsibility, not yours and it is clear this is what your situation is even as you don't have a written lease.  \n\nYou already know he scammed his previous \"future wife\" into \"investing\" in **HIS** property and in the end she go nothing for her \"investment\".  She had do have expected the same kind of returns you're being promised or there is no way she would have paid for renovations to **HIS** house. See this as the pattern it is and demand that he put everything in writing, including a return on your \"investments\" in **HIS** house before you give him any more money that you already do.  If he won't, you know the reality of where you stand and insist that monthly expenses be split 50/50 from now on too.\n\nI have a feeling you already know he will balk at that as well and if he does, GTFO as fast as you can before this USER continues to take advantage of the generosity you already show him on a monthly basis. \n\nTLDR--NTA with a previous pattern to support your position.", "NTA. Right now you are already paying more than him. 40% mortgage + only using your car and gas is not a fair split. Basically you pay half the mortgage while not having a house in return. Hell no to even paying for renovations without being a part owner. I would offe for him to make you part owner and then split all costs equally", "NTA\n\nNo, you're not the asshole for not contributing to your boyfriend's home renovations. You already agreed to pay your fair share of the mortgage, utilities, and everyday expenses. It's understandable that you have concerns about investing in a property you don't own and you've expressed those reservations. Your willingness to contribute more once you have ownership rights shows your commitment. It's important to have open and honest communication with your boyfriend to find a compromise that addresses both of your concerns.", "There are several ways to fix this, including marriage, domestic partnership or an equity sharing contract.  It sounds like his plan is a scam, which has already worked once for him.  NTA", "NTA. For all the stated reasons.", "Nta you make more than reasonable contributions. He sounds like a spoilt entitled child, that noone has said no too. He has now thrown his toys out the pram. I would be asking myself is this relationship worth the hassle.", "Nta\n\nDon't contribute when you have nothing to gain. \n\nAnd your bf sounds like leech. \n\nIt makes sense that he wants to have marble bathrooms, since you're paying for most of the things.", "So he \u201cfeels like he will always be alone in this\u201d. \n\nPoor guy, if only there was a solution to that. /s\n\nLike, say, putting you on the deed. \n\nOr marrying you. \n\nYou are very much NTA here. \n\nHis attitude to using your car would be a red flag to me though. It seems like a small thing in the big picture - but he\u2019s basically saying he will sneakily push any costs onto you that he can, in addition to what you\u2019ve agreed. \n\nHe sounds very ungenerous with his money. \n\nIf you were to marry & have these children you\u2019ve both talked about - and your earning power would reduce at various points (possibly long term due to cumulative effect of dipping out of the job market for a period of time, possibly from long term health problems for either you post-birth or a child being born with additional needs) - do you trust him to take care of you? Generously & with love?\n\nOr would he make you justify every penny you spent of \u201chis\u201d money, so that you weren\u2019t able to buy new bras when your breasts changed size after feeding his babies - or afford to go for a coffee with friends once a month? Or join a gym to try to keep your health a priority even with small children. \n\nSomething to seriously consider!", "NAH  I was with you but then I realized that you want your name on the deed but haven't mentioned buying half of what he already purchased (the house) So I do kind of see why he wants you to help with renos that you also benefit from. \n\nYou need to sit down and hash these details out as yes, he may be building resentment.

While it's highly dependent on the area you live in and his mortgage, generally, the costs you're talking about should add up to rent + utilities were you to be renting an apartment.  Though, honestly, there are things you give up as you don't have a formal tenancy (for example, he could theoretically kick you out immediately if you break up - again, law of the area dependent), so I would think it would be more reasonable if the car was taken out of the equation/he contributes towards the gas and wear & tear or reduces your contributions accordingly.
