There's no reason you should pay for renovations on his house unless he puts your name on it too and you own part of it. I applaud you for having really good boundaries. \n\nEspecially since he makes so much more money than you, it sounds like you pay for too many things. Costs should be pretty equal, especially if you care for your partner enough to think about having a family with them. He should want to pay for half of what you pay for.

You are already going above and beyond in terms of splitting those costs.  But to expect you to share in the costs of upgrades to **HIS** house that increase the value of **HIS** house while your only benefit is though a nicer living space?  Ridiculous.\n\nYou are essentially a tenant in **HIS** house and apparently don't have any legal rights beyond what the law where you live dictates as one should he chose to kick you out of **HIS** house.

She had do have expected the same kind of returns you're being promised or there is no way she would have paid for renovations to **HIS** house. See this as the pattern it is and demand that he put everything in writing, including a return on your \"investments\" in **HIS** house before you give him any more money that you already do.  If he won't, you know the reality of where you stand and insist that monthly expenses be split 50/50 from now on too.\n\nI have a feeling you already know he will balk at that as well and if he does, GTFO as fast as you can before this USER continues to take advantage of the generosity you already show him on a monthly basis. \n\nTLDR--NTA with a previous pattern to support your position.", "NTA. Right now you are already paying more than him. 40% mortgage + only using your car and gas is not a fair split. Basically you pay half the mortgage while not having a house in return. Hell no to even paying for renovations without being a part owner. I would offe for him to make you part owner and then split all costs equally", "NTA\n\nNo, you're not the asshole for not contributing to your boyfriend's home renovations. You already agreed to pay your fair share of the mortgage, utilities, and everyday expenses. It's understandable that you have concerns about investing in a property you don't own and you've expressed those reservations. Your willingness to contribute more once you have ownership rights shows your commitment. It's important to have open and honest communication with your boyfriend to find a compromise that addresses both of your concerns.", "There are several ways to fix this, including marriage, domestic partnership or an equity sharing contract.

It seems like a small thing in the big picture - but he\u2019s basically saying he will sneakily push any costs onto you that he can, in addition to what you\u2019ve agreed. \n\nHe sounds very ungenerous with his money. \n\nIf you were to marry & have these children you\u2019ve both talked about - and your earning power would reduce at various points (possibly long term due to cumulative effect of dipping out of the job market for a period of time, possibly from long term health problems for either you post-birth or a child being born with additional needs) - do you trust him to take care of you? Generously & with love?\n\nOr would he make you justify every penny you spent of \u201chis\u201d money, so that you weren\u2019t able to buy new bras when your breasts changed size after feeding his babies - or afford to go for a coffee with friends once a month? Or join a gym to try to keep your health a priority even with small children. \n\nSomething to seriously consider!", "NAH  I was with you but then I realized that you want your name on the deed but haven't mentioned buying half of what he already purchased (the house) So I do kind of see why he wants you to help with renos that you also benefit from. \n\nYou need to sit down and hash these details out as yes, he may be building resentment.

Sounds like BF is trying to manipulate you.", "NTA. You are his tenant. You are paying him rent. Therefore upkeep and maintenance (let alone improvements) are his responsibility. Also, yes nothing is guaranteed but if got married an divorced, you would have a claim on the house. So yeah, I would not contribute to the capital value of an asset that was not mine.", "NAH you don't need to be on the deed, all you need is a legal doc stating that you will be paid back plus interest for contributing but that if you marry within x amount of time the affect becomes void.", "If he makes twice as much as she does why are they splitting household bills 60/40.

If you're 100% sure he makes twice your income than he's being devious - or financially savvy depending on your POV - and getting his gf to contribute so much so he can build his savings. \n\nI've been with my partner for 3 yrs. It's his house, I'm not on the lease. So I contribute to utilities, groceries but he pays for his mortgage and any renovations he wants. You're doing a lot for a relationship that hasn't even hit the 2 yr point yet, and a house that isn't yours. You have no guarantee this man actually wants to marry and start a family with you. Realistically sounds like he's gonna move on to his next tenant - I mean gf- as soon as the bathroom is renovated. NTA", "NTA\n\nWhy are you contributing to his mortgage?", "NTA. This is a red flag. If you are contributing to the mortgage, you should have an agreement on paper, that the house becomes partially yours. Same if you contribute to renovations. What\u2019s happening now is that he will f*ck you over if you separate.\n\nTell him, if you get everything arranged in a legal contract with stipulations for how much of the house is yours per your contributions, then you\u2019ll happily contribute.\n\nMy husband and I had a similar contract before we got married. He had an inheritance when we bought our house, I didn\u2019t. So we had a notarized contract in which we agreed that I was paying off most of the mortgage in the beginning and that after x years one third of the house would be mine, and after x more years it would be 50/50.", "I honestly think you need to consult a lawyer. Your contributions to the mortgage may already entitle you to a (small) share of the property. I would recommend that you two get a new property to live in together. Your partner can rent out this one which is in his name and you can purchase a second one that is in both your names. That way, you won\u2019t be left with nothing should the relationship go pear shaped. Your partner seems to be a bit out for himself if I may say so. NTA. For example, why is he contributing nothing towards gas and upkeep for your car? Has he suggested you paying him an amount in exchange for part ownership of the property?", "YTA- planning to get married in a year, shacked up, splitting bills, utilities, and food bills, as well  as using the same car.. but fuck paying for this bathroom renovation idea I think sounds awesome! Yeah. YTA, OP.", "NTA. You're technically having a rentl agreement. It doesn't matter if he pays his mortgage with that money or maintenance. That's on him, but that's what rent money is for. You don't own him any extras.", "NTA\n\nHe will always be alone in it as he is making improvements to his home.", "NTA  \n\n\nHe *feels like \u201che will always be alone in this\u201d* because he has chosen to be alone in the ownership of the home!  \n\n\nIt's been two years, you plan to marry. That's long enough.   \n\n\nStep 1) Check the laws where you live. In some places you already are common law and any appreciation to the house is already yours-regardless of your contribution. In other places , you have zero rights to the house. The second scenario is more common, but it's worth checking.   \n\n\nStep 2) Get yourself on the deed. If he wants to protect his initial investment in the house, that can be done. Visit a lawyer and divvy up the house. This will depend on where you live, but you can be joint tenants (always equal) or tenants in common (unequal shares possible). Ideally you want the initial investment carved out and then joint tenancy for the rest.   \n\n\nStep 3) Do not, for the love of all thing holy, have a child until the housing/financial situation is sorted. Women almost  inevitiably take a hit to their career and earning potential and future pensions when they have children. Once children enter the equation, joint finances and joint investments are a must. If your partner plans to be a stay-at-home dad the same would apply.", "NTA and die on this hill.", "NTA", "NTA. At this point, you are a tenant and he is your landlord. When a landlord starts to renovate their property, tenants do not pay an additional fee towards those renovations.

Do not sink money into a house you aren't on the title to, no WAY. All the other costs, other than your car (which seems unbalanced if he's not even paying for gas) equate for rent, which is fair. Renters dont have to pay for home maintenance or renovation.", "NTA he wants to take advantage of you like he did his ex.  You\u2019re smart. Don\u2019t do it unless he adds you to the deed.

It's his almost constant use of your car. It's your purchase of the groceries half the time. It's also your covering the utilities.

You are exactly right about the entire situation. You would be a fool to pay for renovations on a home you have absolutely no claim to in any way and would likely involve legal wrangling to get any of that money back if at all if a break up or other situation should happen.", "NTA, when my SO and I lived in a place that I owned, he paid me half the running costs, utilities and groceries. When I did improvements I paid as they increased the value of my asset. I also got final/only say in colors, styles etc. When we bought a place together we halved those costs because we both own the apartment (but agreeing on anything style wise is impossible)", "NTA. You\u2019re not on the mortgage, consider him a landlord.

Is everything else in your relationship okay? Or is he subsidizing his life with girlfriends? \n\nTell him you need a contract about ownership or rights to overvalue or anything else before you will contribute to his house. Yes, it\u2019ll probably start a fight\u2026 but you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything right now. \n\nTo put it another way, I moved into my husband\u2019s home when we were dating. He paid for everything related to the house, and when we got married, the house stayed in his name but we signed an agreement that half of any proceeds would be mine if we sold the house for any reason. \n\nThis took lots of painful conversations that started with him accusing me of wanting to steal the house from him or steal the inheritance from his kids. It took lots of time for him to realize that we\u2019re a partnership and that the kids will get everything after both of us are gone. \n\nWell, we sold the house and bought a new one, which is now 50% mine.\n\nHe said that he wouldn\u2019t have made the profit without me contributing expenses along the way because he wouldn\u2019t have been able to stay in the home without me. \n\nMy husband had a lot of issues from his previous relationships, but he realized that he wanted our relationship to succeed. One of the biggest steps was us agreeing that we\u2019re both coming from a place where we aren\u2019t trying to get one over on the other\u2014everything we do and say is given the benefit of the doubt.\n\nI wish you luck!", "Toilet paper, papers towels, etc. are groceries. and how on earth do you spend 500 a month on gas?  Do you commute for New York to Virginia for work?", "Funny how everything works out for him while you pay the bill.", "NTA. He used the last partner, now he\u2019s trying it with you.

My partner insisted I live with him for free and his  take on it was that he\u2019s going to have to pay his mortgage regardless of whether I live with him or not  because he chose to purchase a home and since he purchased the home based on his income and what he can afford, it doesn\u2019t make sense to factor my income into it so asking me to pay into his mortgage in his opinion didn\u2019t make sense.
