There's no reason you should pay for renovations on his house unless he puts your name on it too and you own part of it. I applaud you for having really good boundaries. \n\nEspecially since he makes so much more money than you, it sounds like you pay for too many things. Costs should be pretty equal, especially if you care for your partner enough to think about having a family with them. He should want to pay for half of what you pay for.

You are already going above and beyond in terms of splitting those costs.  But to expect you to share in the costs of upgrades to **HIS** house that increase the value of **HIS** house while your only benefit is though a nicer living space?  Ridiculous.\n\nYou are essentially a tenant in **HIS** house and apparently don't have any legal rights beyond what the law where you live dictates as one should he chose to kick you out of **HIS** house.

She had do have expected the same kind of returns you're being promised or there is no way she would have paid for renovations to **HIS** house. See this as the pattern it is and demand that he put everything in writing, including a return on your \"investments\" in **HIS** house before you give him any more money that you already do.  If he won't, you know the reality of where you stand and insist that monthly expenses be split 50/50 from now on too.\n\nI have a feeling you already know he will balk at that as well and if he does, GTFO as fast as you can before this USER continues to take advantage of the generosity you already show him on a monthly basis. \n\nTLDR--NTA with a previous pattern to support your position.", "NTA. Right now you are already paying more than him. 40% mortgage + only using your car and gas is not a fair split. Basically you pay half the mortgage while not having a house in return. Hell no to even paying for renovations without being a part owner. I would offe for him to make you part owner and then split all costs equally", "NTA\n\nNo, you're not the asshole for not contributing to your boyfriend's home renovations. You already agreed to pay your fair share of the mortgage, utilities, and everyday expenses. It's understandable that you have concerns about investing in a property you don't own and you've expressed those reservations. Your willingness to contribute more once you have ownership rights shows your commitment. It's important to have open and honest communication with your boyfriend to find a compromise that addresses both of your concerns.", "There are several ways to fix this, including marriage, domestic partnership or an equity sharing contract.

It seems like a small thing in the big picture - but he\u2019s basically saying he will sneakily push any costs onto you that he can, in addition to what you\u2019ve agreed. \n\nHe sounds very ungenerous with his money. \n\nIf you were to marry & have these children you\u2019ve both talked about - and your earning power would reduce at various points (possibly long term due to cumulative effect of dipping out of the job market for a period of time, possibly from long term health problems for either you post-birth or a child being born with additional needs) - do you trust him to take care of you? Generously & with love?\n\nOr would he make you justify every penny you spent of \u201chis\u201d money, so that you weren\u2019t able to buy new bras when your breasts changed size after feeding his babies - or afford to go for a coffee with friends once a month? Or join a gym to try to keep your health a priority even with small children. \n\nSomething to seriously consider!", "NAH  I was with you but then I realized that you want your name on the deed but haven't mentioned buying half of what he already purchased (the house) So I do kind of see why he wants you to help with renos that you also benefit from. \n\nYou need to sit down and hash these details out as yes, he may be building resentment.

I asked him what the probably was of his ex-wife working with me to keep the house and he said none. He promptly put my name on the deed and when I told him this was huge because I'm not on the mortgage (it would have been costly for us at the time), he told me that knowing I would be cared for was important and his financial obligations to his son were and would continue to be met concurrently. I'll never forget my husband did that for me but I do think it made a difference that we had been together for awhile and I had contributed to the mortgage (\"rent\") and had shown I was dependable. Like you have done.\n\nedit: clarity", "Why don\u2019t you compromise? He pays for the improvements now since he wants them now even though they aren\u2019t needed immediately. You put aside a fair amount into a savings account that you will turn over to reimburse him only after you\u2019re married.", "NTA. You pay too much even now. 40% of mortgage for house that is not yours? Other payments also mostly from your pocket? While he has twice your income? That's crazy! It think he is using you and pretends having financial trust issues. This payment division is completely unfair to you.", "NTA.  He is the one benefiting from the added value to the home.  I wouldn't be helping with the mortgage, either, until we were married AND I had a written agreement granting me ownership of the equity I was paying for.", "You paying 40% of his mortage is already way too much. I would not be ok with even that.", "NTA. Ya'll need to have a sit down about finances. If we look at the whole pot of money, your BF makes twice what you do, so logically, he should pay 2/3 of the expenses if making things equitable was the goal. \n\nYou have expressed interest in future plans and he wants them to happen now, but he doesn't want to put a ring on it first. You don't have to have kids the minute you get married. He could assign part of the title to you at any time (usually), but he hasn't. So he's done nothing to assuage your fears that you're improving and adding value to a high value asset only he will gain from should anything happen to your relationship. \n\nIf he wants to renovate his home, you're not stopping him, but you're not encouraging or contributing to it (although, I bet you are letting in trades people, arranging food/water around electricity and water outages etc). \n\n\"I'm not comfortable paying for renovations prior to a formal commitment from you and your dismissal of my concerns is not encouraging. I'm saying these things would be nice in the future and you doing them now is fine, but it's not expected or encouraged and I feel like you resent the fact I am uncomfortable paying into unnecessary improvements to this house when we're not married.\"", "NTA - it all comes down to the fact that it isn't your house, and it will continue to fall that way until he makes you an equal partner in writing. Fuck giving him 10k and just being out all that money if you break up.", ">I also don\u2019t want to be like his ex who contributed to similar expenses and obviously that didn\u2019t work out\n\nSo you're saying there's a pattern of this?", "adding windows to bathrooms for \"natural light\" is some of the dumbest shit i've heard of people doing recently. Windows are a disaster in a bathroom and you will get mold inside your walls.", "Here's the thing - as he bought the property prior to the marriage, it could conceivably remain his after the marriage - unless you use marital funds on it, at which point it's a shared asset.\n\nSo, until you are married, don't toss money into his $$$ renovations. Or, he can draw up some legal document that says that if you split up prior to the marriage, you get your renovation funds returned. Make a prenup - outline expectations and responsibilities. Meet with a financial planner or someone who can outline some fair way of approaching marriage and money.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like what's his is his and what's yours is his. Many divorces are over money, so you should figure it out prior to saying \"I do\" as it's way cheaper - both financially and emotionally if you can get on the same page, or jump to a new book, before there's a wedding and children.", "NTA. No More letting him decide whose car you two take, either. Take turns or don't go at all.", "NTA. No ring, no ownership of the house, no money towards improvements. Yes, they benefit you, but it's his house. I live with my BF as well and all the projects he's done he's paid for. I told him I'll pay when I'm married but I'm not investing in a house should things not work out (and that's not meant to be a negative outlook on the relationship - we both believe we'll last - but till then it's his house, his improvements, his money problem lol)", "NTA. Not something I would do if the person wasn't my spouse.", "NTA. \n\nYou are discussing marriage and children, but are not engaged and have not furthered the plan. You need to have a very frank and honest conversation; at what point do you have any entitlement to the home, what does your contribution look like in comparison to your value if your relationship ends and how does this look when you are marriage with kid(s)\n\nWhile nothing is guaranteed, your renovations are an investment in your home and should you end the relationship you should not have to walk away without a portion of that investment. If he does not want you to have any access to the property value, then you do not contribute...but, how does that look as your relationship progresses to marriage and children. \n\nThere is a larger issue here, he wants to the control and ownership - but also wants your money. Before children are involved, this is a MUST to be discussed.", "NTA. It's his house. You aren't on the deed. If you were renting you wouldn't pay the landlord for renovations. He can use the 40 percent you are helping out with to pay for that himself.", "AITA at it again with double standards. Take a look at how many comments would be calling this OP a deadbeat and freeloader if genders were reversed. [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrzesx/aita\\_my\\_boyfriend\\_doesnt\\_want\\_to\\_pay\\_his\\_portion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrzesx/aita_my_boyfriend_doesnt_want_to_pay_his_portion/)\n\nLook how many people argue for paying rent when the owner of the place is a woman and look at how many argue for not paying any rent when the owner of the place is a man.", "Nta he should put a ring on it then", "**\u201che will always be alone in this\u201d.**\n\nNot always, just until your name is on the deed to the house (which IMHO should absolutely not happen until you're actually married OR you pay him for half of his current equity in the house).  (ALSO if he makes TWICE what you do your total contribution (including the gas for the car and household items) should be split in a 2:1 ratio NOT 60/40 PLUS the extra $500 a month for gas and household supplies.", "NTA\n\nYour landlord is fully responsible for renovating and maintenance.", "NTA if I had to pick something, but I also don't think this is as simple as \"my name is not on the home deed, I don't pay for any renovations\" considering you will be able to benefit from those renovations directly by living there with a man you want to marry and have kids with.\n\nIf you don't trust him, why would you want to marry him and have kids in 2023 when it's probably never been easier and more acceptable for a woman to never get married or have children? If you do trust him, you can work out a legal agreement as a stipulation of part of the prenuptial agreement where, in the event of divorce - he pay you back for the money spent or something. I'm not a lawyer, I'm just saying. There's nothing wrong with having trust but also not allowing yourself to be taken advantage of.\n\nIf you want to say it isn't about trust, I'm not sure I understand why you're living with someone you have a verbal agreement with and state you have intentions with at building a life when you have a dollar amount of contribution you will not contribute to a life you intend to share. What happens in the future with this mindset? You contribute less than the man, is that because you're paid less? I imagine that would be a real turn off if a man did this to you if the roles were reversed? Would you be in the reverse? Like, would you let your man live with you, contributing 40% or so of some of the bills? What if he haggles about what he's responsible for? Your home, you take out your trash? As if marriage without a prenup protects him from you from claiming half his home anyway?\n\nMan, relationships get real complicated the longer they go on.", "NTA. If you\u2019re paying 40% of the mortgage, all the expenses (plus use of your car = wear and tear, maintenance, miles, gas) and he makes *twice* as much as you!? You\u2019re being taken for a ride girl. You make half as much and contribute an equal share for zero equity. That\u2019s pretty shite.", "NTA don\u2019t pay for the renovations and also check what your rights are regarding paying into the mortgage. \n\nIn the UK at least if you live with your partners and pay into their mortgage you gain equity in their home even if you aren\u2019t on the deed. In the event of a separation you could sue for your share of the equity. They would have to get you to sign some kind of rental agreement to make that not the case effectively making them your landlord, which seems a very gross dynamic for equal partners.\n\nBut yeah as others have said, huge red flag that he has already got an ex to pay to do up his home, did he pay them back when they separated? \n\nAlso he can complain all he likes about \u201cbeing alone in this\u201d, he is the one choosing to keep sole ownership and not put you on the lease, so yeah, he is alone by choice.", "Sounds like he's taking the piss unless the marriage will give you entitlement based on mortgage contributions and investment in renovation. Not an expert on the matter so don't no if it is a thing.\n\nNTA to say no. You should use this conversation as a springboard discuss your proprietary rights. My general feeling is that, unless the divorce laws will protect you, you're shooting yourself in the foot by continuing to pay rent whilst having no stake in the property. He is able to make an investment, you are not.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to get any of the profit when he sells the house, so why the hell would you pay for them?? He\u2019s basically your landlord - all upkeep on the home itself is legally in his care. Keep it that way.", "NTA.  Without some agreement covering the home you are investing in someone else's property at this point.  And paying 40% of the mortgage certainly \"helps a lot!\"  If he wants you to improve his home he needs to give you an ownership interest in it.  BTW, if you have joint accounts and have comingled funds you may have already established some ownership interest in assets in some states.", "Not to mention that if they get married, she will likely go on the deed and be entitled to some (if not half) of the house\u2019s value if/when they sell. Even if they get divorced it will be a marital asset she has some claim on. But as just the girlfriend? No claim!", "And his comments about divorce don't help his position: if they were married she would have more rights than a live in girlfriend, especially if they had kids.\n\nNTA OP, do not contribute to renovations /capital improvements unless he puts a ring on it and your name is on title.", ">but why are you paying any amount of money to a mortgage you\u2019re not on?\n\nThat's called rent, buddy. You pay it when you don't own the place you live.\n\nOP is NTA. Paying the mortgage is juat you paying part of the rent. Buying necessities is a nice gesture, but maybe reconsider how often you do it.\n\nHowever, you should not pay for any modifications unless you're on the deed or get a contract signed that if you can no longer live in his house for whatever reason he has to recompense you for the modification costs.", "They need to work out a deal where she gets equity in the house proportionate to what she's contributing towards it. Personally I think in a relationship one person paying rent to the other is ridiculous. The partner who owns the house should either let the other live there rent-free (contributing to utilities, food and other running costs, of course, but not mortgage) or they should have an agreement where the other person contributes to the mortgage (and renovations etc.) and gets put on the deed. A romantic relationship isn't the same as a tenant-landlord situation.", "Charging rent for a mortgage is such a backwards american thing. Either you are on the deed or you don't pay a thing. The boyfriend is enriching himself at the expense of his girlfriend.", "that is a stupid take. if she was renting elsewhere her landlords will use what she pays in rent to pay off the mortgage. why do you feel she is obligated to live rent free?", "THANK YOU. As a European, I don't understand this either. If I owned my house 100% AND I made twice my partner's income, I would not charge him rent, and he would not contribute to the mortgage. If I'm the only one benefitting from having my name on the deed, I pay. He would just cover half of utilities.", "oh yes because they should be living rent free just because they are sleeping with the \"landlord\"", "As opposed to renting a house from someone and paying 100% of their mortgage?", ">The current setup of paying 40% of his mortgage plus utilities, plus the wear and tear and gas of her car usage is wayyy more money than if she just rented a room like a tenant.\n\nDoubtful. 40% of my mortgage when I bought my house would have been like $400/month. Bedroom rentals in my neighborhood were about $500/month minimum at the time in much more run down houses.", "A tenant should never have to pay for renovations, so I wouldn\u2019t even offer up that math, as he could use it against her with future larger renovations.", "She's not getting a whole house, she's paying to share one.", "If you're renting as a house share you're still paying per room.", "It\u2019s becoming more popular. Often it\u2019s because, historically, women end up unable to leave a bad marriage if the man holds the purse strings and a lot of moms told their daughters \u201ckeep some money for yourself\u201d when married.", "Tenants essentially pay for all renovations, it's just collected in the form of rent which should be higher than any owning costs.", "So she\u2019s not paying full price, she\u2019s paying less than half. Seems reasonable? Especially considering we don\u2019t know - maybe bf had a roommate before to offset costs", "People who rent a room in a house ALSO have full access to the rest of the house, lol.", "Part of the mortgage goes toward building equity, so 50% wouldn\u2019t be fair, as she is not getting any of the equity.\n\nIt also does really depend on the mortgage payment vs market rent. The mortgage could be a 15-year at 7%, or it could be a 30-year at 3%. The payments would be dramatically different, but the \u201crent\u201d should be the same and dictated by the market rate for rent.", "Rent should be market rent for a comparable property (i.e., sharing a house with another tenant).\n\nIf the landlord wants to make improvements, that\u2019s their decision, and it comes out of the landlord\u2019s pocket. They can then decide to raise the rent if the improved property warrants it.\n\nThat\u2019s how it works.\n\nTry as a landlord to have your tenant pay directly for improvements (even partially), and you will just get laughed at.", "65.5 cents per mile includes gas, taxes, and insurance. Wear and tear is only a fraction of that value.", "Yeah on hindsight that wasn't really clear lol. In her case she doesn't rent a room and has access to the rest of the house, she's renting a full house with a 2nd person living there. Would be like a BF/GF moving into a rented house, not really like roommates renting rooms in houses.", "Of course she's not getting equity, just like she wouldn't by paying rent to a landlord. The only difference is her landlord is het BF and it might one day really be hers for 50%. Most renters never really move to that step. Even if they rent a place for their whole life. She's just a renter at the time, they aren't even married so of course she's not getting any equity out of his ownership. That's just normal.\n\nWe'd have to know first to make a judgement. But lets stick to averages and on average mortgage is lower than renting the same housing.", "> If the landlord wants to make improvements, that\u2019s their decision, **and it comes out of the landlord\u2019s pocket**. They can then decide to raise the rent if the improved property warrants it.\n\nThe same pocket that has been filled with, you got it, rent!", "No, it\u2019s exactly the same as roommates renting rooms in houses, lol.  If I rent a room in a house, I still have full access to the rest of the house.", "Their situation is not like roommates renting a room, please, this is not even a discussion. It's a simple fact. Maybe my explanation is wrong, but you can't seriously mean to compare a couple living together in a house to roommates renting rooms. You just can't."]}
