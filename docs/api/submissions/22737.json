Some others then chimed in and said how easy it all was before kids and how easy I have it and my body is nothing special. I didn\u2019t say anything because I am pretty uncomfortable with body talk in general.

Pregnancy can change your physical structure. I would imagine they meant that it would be even more difficult, most likely, for you\u2019re body to return to its current state had you given birth. But they said it poorly, and honestly it wasn\u2019t something that needed to be said either.

After children it is a little difficult to lose as quickly as a person used to, but it is still doable if you're willing to put forth the effort.  Even if you do have children someday, if you keep up with working out, you'll still look as good as you do now.

By the time you added up baby\u2019s weight, amniotic fluid, increased blood volume and placenta you\u2019re looking at 12-15 pounds. So I gained about 5 pounds. Every pregnancy is different.

I've got a few stretch marks, but nothing that bothers me. \n\nI am also 20 years into parenting, and one thing I've realized is actually present in some of the replies to this comment. People really seem to need to believe that cases like this are some alien freak show of outlier genetics. Nobody wants to have the conversation about how there's a pretty big correlation between fitness levels and how we look post-babies. Of course some things like skin elasticity are less able to be controlled, but I really didn't appreciate the way people wanted to just pin everything on genetics when I actually was playing rugby competitively and working out really hard between my pregnancies. If I mentioned this during any of these conversations, like, \"yeah, hidden benefits of playing rugby, I guess lol\", people would get offended and some would actually argue with me that genetics were all that mattered. \n\nI think it's a self-protection mechanism the brain has. Like, people know they don't like what they look like postpartum, so the more they can believe it was inevitable and anyone who is in better physical condition than they are is simply carrying freak genes, the more at peace with their own reality they can be. If they actually saw what went into being in the kind of physical condition that tends to recover from pregnancy more easily, they would have to admit they had a choice to some degree.\n\nOf course in reality there are all sorts of barriers to achieving high levels of fitness, cost, time, disability. Even so, it is equally true that especially in the US, most people are pretty sedentary and could choose to be more physically active in some way, which in this sense, could have possibly improved things for them. Nobody wants to think about that, so they default to \"this is what happens to everyone when they have babies and if it didn't happen to you, you're not normal\". \n\nOP is definitely NTA. I've started making similar comments when people tell me how \"lucky\" I am to be in the shape I'm in at my age (40's).
