Some others then chimed in and said how easy it all was before kids and how easy I have it and my body is nothing special. I didn\u2019t say anything because I am pretty uncomfortable with body talk in general. But at some point it became a bit much and I said that I don\u2019t think my body is just from not having had kids but that I also work out a lot.

I can name tons of people including myself who are obese and never had kids, I can also name tons of people who have had multiple kids who are in great shape.", "NTA. She was just being a jealous hag.", "oof vanity. NTA.", "They sounds pretty jelly.\nI hate how many times I have to say this, but it\u2019s rude to comment on appearances. Positive and negative.\nNTA", "NTA. Typical jealous chicks blaming their kids for all their problems.", "NTA - in fact I would say thank you for saying it. I mean most married men would just nod along and their Mrs comments how women with kids have it easy to maintain their body", "Lol, I have had 3 kids and am fairly slim and petite. Then again, every one of my kids likes to pull the running game. So no NTA. I met women who had never had kids and were overweight due to depression and having an unhealthy relationship with food. Not all bods are mom bods. For some, sadly, it comes from bad habits encouraged by the previous generation.", "NTA and clearly that person was speaking out of shame of their own body issues. The work you put into your health and fitness shouldn\u2019t be tossed out flippantly in conversation. \n\nHowever, I read the \u2018has it easy\u2019 comment, as a woman who has given birth twice, to mean that regardless of the time and effort I put into my health and fitness I won\u2019t ever look like I did when I put the same effort in pre-children. Pregnancy can change your physical structure. I would imagine they meant that it would be even more difficult, most likely, for you\u2019re body to return to its current state had you given birth. But they said it poorly, and honestly it wasn\u2019t something that needed to be said either. I am inclined to believe these women are still struggling with the current reality and state of their own bodies and how to embrace the current. It\u2019s a struggle for sure but doesn\u2019t need to be taken out on others", "NTA. That's just a wake up call that they didn't want to hear.", "Having known many women who aren't \"fit\" at all despite never having been pregnant, the parents' comments to the non-parent seem out of touch and self-serving.  Go to our town pool and you will see many \"fit\" women with kids.  NTA", "\u2026. I had a kid and was back to my pre-pregnancy body in 6 weeks, but with bigger boobs (breastfeeding) and some stretch marks.\n\nI think your comments were accurate and see nothing wrong with them.\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t see where you belittled or downplayed anything. This should have been just some talk among coworkers. Unless you said it very rudely or snobby, they are probably just jealous.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let anyone dismiss your efforts. Exercise is good for the body and the mind. Being a parent doesn\u2019t mean you have to let yourself go or whatever they were saying. Having kids is what really motivated me to take better care of myself. I want to be a healthy example for them. \n\nMore importantly, commenting on someone else\u2019s body, even as a compliment, is just ick to me. Everyone is different, we have different needs and different speeds and different shapes. Do groups of guys talk about each others bodies this way?", "NTA - I have 3 children and I could tell you that if I had worked out after I had them, I would look just as good as I used to, but I didn't so that makes it my own fault. Too me there is nothing worse than people who makes excuses for how they don't look. After children it is a little difficult to lose as quickly as a person used to, but it is still doable if you're willing to put forth the effort.  Even if you do have children someday, if you keep up with working out, you'll still look as good as you do now. Honesty doesn't always sit right with people that feel inadequate about themselves around others, but it is always the best policy!!", "NTA. Not at all. They were jealous you got a compliment and instead of acting like adults they behaved like immature jerks.", "Nta. Not one on so many levels. There comments were highly inappropriate. You worked HARD to have the body you do. I had a pregnancy (that was complicated and ended with me in heart failure)\u2026I gained 50 pounds. With my second pregnancy I gained 17 pounds bc I ate extremely healthy and worked out 4-5 days a week out of fear I would go into heart failure again. By the time you added up baby\u2019s weight, amniotic fluid, increased blood volume and placenta you\u2019re looking at 12-15 pounds. So I gained about 5 pounds. Every pregnancy is different. But pregnancy doesn\u2019t magically give you a bad body. It gives you a body that is stretched and needs time to repair itself on so many levels but pregnancy doesn\u2019t mean bad. They are wrong to throw your lack of children on why your body looks the way it does.", "Nope NTA; while some things can't go back to normal after having kids; they're ALOT you can do to help it. \n\nI had a severe diastasis that could only be corrected with a Tummy tuck.... so I got a mommy makeover to just knock it all out at once.... if someone makes a comment I tell em I'm after market!!!", "No, but they were. You work out, walk exercise and dance -all of which keep the body tone and you probably eat healthy and not a ton of kick food but a lot less f women would choose to blame pregnancy and motherhood instead of lack of exercise, too much caloric intake and poor nutrition for the condition of their bodies. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing and let the haters over eat/skip exercise and hate.", "I mean if these were men commenting on your body you'd hear all sorts of comments about them being creeps and misogynists, so why do these women get a pass?\n\nRock that bikini as long as you enjoy wearing it.

Typical for the average American", "NTA\n\nThey projected their insecurities on you, it is very uncomfortable", "No they are assholes and went too far in general but it may be a hot take and mom's don't want to hear it but they have a baby and take that as a pass to let themselves go for the rest of their lives. \n\nWhat that lady said is not true. Plenty of people get in better shape post pregnancy than before. It's not the same body for many reasons but they are taking a lazy cop out. If they don't want to be fit that is fine but don't use the same excuse cause you had kids 3 4 5 or 10 years ago", "NTA - people often speak from a position of insecurity or chime in to pile on.

Your co-workers just sound jealous, bitter, lazy, and judgmental. \n\nNTA", "NTA and I appreciate you sticking up for mom bodies. That was what we call a pack of haridans, they are jealous and projecting. I've had 4 children, my body isn't the same, that doesn't make it bad, I love myself as I am.

They\u2019re just making excuses for their own laziness etc. There are PLENTY of moms with rocking bodies.", "I\u2019m 2 sizes smaller in everything except boobs since I had kids. Nursing helps. \n\nThey\u2019re idiots. NTA", "Obviously NTA. You got a compliment, accepted it gracefully, and they felt the need to attack; \"your body is nothing special\" is crazy when you're not fishing for compliments.\n\nI get it, the looking-good-in-a-swimsuit compliment is held in high regard as many people are insecure about their swimsuit body. It probably stung to hear ego cookies were being given out and then not recieve one.
