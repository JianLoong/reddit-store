I work a job that pays 60K a year and he is unemployed and collects 'benefits' off of his parents. He's been unemployed since covid when he was fired and never got round to finding a job again. \n\nRecently I've been looking into buying a house. He's been supportive of this and getting us out of the crazy renting market. I managed to find a house I love and talked to him about it. We visited together and decided this is the one. \n\nNow it gets to paperwork and mortgage stuff and I complete it and pay the deposit. I tell him that it's all gone through and we should be on track to moving in a couple of months. He asks to go through the paperwork and I agree. 3 days later he confronts me and asks why everything is in my name. I reply because it's my money and I'm the one paying the mortgage, you're not putting any money or effort into the property. He retaliates saying I'm being financially abusive and says that I can't expect to own everything. \n\nLater on we talk again and we discuss our issues with it. I agreed that in my will the house is left to him, as well as most of my savings. He says it's not enough and if we split up he's left with nothing. It gets heated and I tell him of he wanted a house he should have worked for it, not stayed at home and relied on me. I said if he wanted to be on the mortgage it means he will have to find a job that pays the same as mine. \n\nThe argument hasn't really resolved itself and I'm wondering now whether I am being inconsiderate of him.

You are not financially abusing them. Mooching off others is the absolute opposite of that.

Are you still under contract, or did you already close? By deposit, are you talking about earnest and/or closing costs? Or are you referring to the down payment when you say \"deposit\"? Im confused on where in the process you are in the home purchase, since move in day is months away.\n\nPersonally, it sounds like you already closed, and already have the house, in which case, the argument is truly already resolved anyway. You would need to go through a refinance, etc, to get his name on the house after the fact.\n\nBut this is NTA, because he hasnt contributed financially at all in the process it sounds like, and his claim that this is \"financially abusive\" is complete hogwash, because for the fact is that he contributed nothing, so why should he expect something if you and him were to split up. \n\nI feel that hes only entitled only to what he contributed, and since he contributed nothing, he is entitled to nothing.

His parents supported him and he lived with you and you paid all the bills. \n\nYou need to make some decisions how to proceed here.  If he is adamant in wanting to be on the house deed, then you are going to be put in a tough situation.  What he calls financial abuse is really you trying to protect what you have earned on your own merits.  Really, what he wants is a form of financial abuse.  I'm afraid your partner is turning into a choosing beggar.  Don't let him get a foot in here.

That's why it's called \"work.\" What we do enjoy is being able to pay the bills for ourselves and our families.\n\nHow has he brainwashed you into believed the best option is his not working ever  bc he doesn't enjoy school or work?  How awful!  No one else has ever not enjoyed going to school or work!  The rest of us just love it and CAN'T WAIT for Monday mornings to come again!\n\nWhat most adults do is find work they like well enough or don't hate, that pays their bills, so THEY WON'T BE HOMELESS.  Honestly, there are benefits to work in addition to pay -- self-respect, and the confidence you can take care of yourself without manipulating your SO into putting you on a title (s)he's 100% paying for.\n\nIn the long run, that might make him happier/more secure -- and if not, and he genuinely prefers to keep sponging off of you, is that something you're okay with and will be able to afford indefinitely, esp if you might want children or retirement at some point?  What if one of you gets sick, esp you?  Would he support you the way you're supporting him?", "To bad?  I hate my job, but I have bills to pay.", "Wait, this is insanity. So you take on the debt, the financial responsibility of the mortgage, taxes, repairs etc. and he does.....nothing?! But expects to be on the paperwork? Huge red flag!! No, no, and no.", "Well, I think you were wrong to get this far into the process without discussing money and ownership. And it sounds like you were pretty cutting in your communications with him (although after the financial abuse suggestion). And I think you take some of the AH title for that. \n\nBut you don't owe him half of your house for dating him! Maybe suggest that living rent free with you could allow him to save up some money to put into his ow property, or a future property that you buy together.", "According to google if you are commom law (living together for 2 or more years) or financially supported the other then you can be. I would recommend getting in touch with a solicitor to have a cohab agreement done up.", "That\u2019s the definition of lazy. We\u2019d all like to not work. Sorry you\u2019re too deep in to see what a horrible situation you\u2019re in. \n\nI\u2019ve got an Aunty who did all the work because her husband doesn\u2019t like working. We all feel sorry for her. It\u2019s not a life I would wish on anyone. They\u2019ve got children. Try to imagine how that life would be with him if you want them.", "So then as far as im concerned no you didn't actually have a conversation as to what owner ship would look like yall danced around it while making assumptions your partner making assumptions based on the fact you are partners sharing your lives with other and ideally engaging in equal partnership.\n\nAnd you assuming you get more in the partnership because of money.\n\nIf you arent okay with your partner being a home maker instead of a professional of some capacity then you need to bring that up and realize that resenting that will be a relationship killer.\n\nOr\n\nIf you are okay with them being a homemaker the. You cant hold them not having a paid job against them for ownership of their own home.", "What is he bringing to your relationship? He\u2019s not working. He\u2019s demanding. You\u2019re supporting both of you. Honestly, why are you with him?", "He agreed it would be a good idea so he could continue to mooch off of you. He has no motivation to find a job because you are supporting him. If you add him and you split up, he\u2019d be entitled to half without contributing a dime. \n\nYou deserve better.", "Thank you lol, I'm getting alot of people forgetting gays exist here", "If that's true, I wouldn't want him moving in. \n\nWhile I understand that relationships aren't necessarily 50/50, I don't understand someone putting up with an able bodied \"partner\" who doesn't bring any money to relationship, but gets a pass because he does the dishes. I'm guessing OP does plenty of house work as well.", "Thank you for the laugh!", "Housekeeping is a responsibility of everyone who lives in a house, u/TryComfortable4289 does he do ALL housework?", "Sugar Daddy* theyre both male.", "Is he a \"homemaker\" tho? It sounds like he just doesn't work.", "I don't think you understand what a conversation is", "I agree. I would definitely want a cohabitation agreement in place", "No but he does a good share of it", "Thank you, fixed.  Apologies.", "Historically thats what people say about homemakers. Without understanding that their labor around the home enabled and subsidized the other partners professional efforts because they didn't have to focus on the home. \n\nIt is traditionally considered feminine work and therfore just not valued appropriately.", "Pretty sure this is your loser bf's account, ignore this horrible take.", "An exchange of thoughts and ideas usually in real-time between two or more participants through either verbal or written forms of communication.\n\nYou're not as clever as you wish.", "Your relationship is your business, I personally would not be into your partner for that reason but it's your business. But he shouldn't own half the house while contributing nothing. His parents should really cut him off so he can grow up but again, not my life.", "I do a good share of the housekeeping. Oh yeah, I also work being the sole provider. Your partner is lazy. Stop defending his behavior.", "Ok, then charge him slightly less rent.", "What? No. It would be different if OP said he & his partner had a conversation at some point and decided his bf would SAH bcuz OP could support them both financially & agreed with it. That IS NOT what happened here. The bf lost his job during covid, got on unemployment and now his parents give him money? OP says he just doesn\u2019t like to work. Cool if he chooses not to work & his parents want to support that nonsense but that DOES NOT mean he\u2019s some under appreciated stay at home partner. He\u2019s an entitled mooch that expects all of the reward with none of the work. And you just sound salty and are trying to make a case for a homemaker that DOES NOT apply here.", "That's what we did, we talked about it in person, and detailed our thoughts and hopes.", "And clearly you weren't specific about what the real world expectations and practicalities were going to be. You have to be exceedingly specific. Talking about what you hope for isn't enough. Thats not actually establishing a real plan or real expectations.", "If OP said \u201cI am buying a house\u201d not \u201cwe are buying a house\u201d it was made pretty clear."]}
