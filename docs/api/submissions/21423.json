I work a job that pays 60K a year and he is unemployed and collects 'benefits' off of his parents. He's been unemployed since covid when he was fired and never got round to finding a job again. \n\nRecently I've been looking into buying a house. He's been supportive of this and getting us out of the crazy renting market. I managed to find a house I love and talked to him about it. We visited together and decided this is the one. \n\nNow it gets to paperwork and mortgage stuff and I complete it and pay the deposit. I tell him that it's all gone through and we should be on track to moving in a couple of months. He asks to go through the paperwork and I agree. 3 days later he confronts me and asks why everything is in my name. I reply because it's my money and I'm the one paying the mortgage, you're not putting any money or effort into the property. He retaliates saying I'm being financially abusive and says that I can't expect to own everything. \n\nLater on we talk again and we discuss our issues with it. I agreed that in my will the house is left to him, as well as most of my savings. He says it's not enough and if we split up he's left with nothing. It gets heated and I tell him of he wanted a house he should have worked for it, not stayed at home and relied on me. I said if he wanted to be on the mortgage it means he will have to find a job that pays the same as mine. \n\nThe argument hasn't really resolved itself and I'm wondering now whether I am being inconsiderate of him.

He just forced it on you by not finding a job?\n\nYeah, someone\u2019s committing some financial abuse here, but it\u2019s not *you.*", "NTA.  Your partner has not contributed in any way.  You are not financially abusing them. Mooching off others is the absolute opposite of that.  If they can come up with a portion of the deposit and split the mortgage then they may have a resaon to request it. Otherwise... no way.

Are you still under contract, or did you already close? By deposit, are you talking about earnest and/or closing costs? Or are you referring to the down payment when you say \"deposit\"? Im confused on where in the process you are in the home purchase, since move in day is months away.\n\nPersonally, it sounds like you already closed, and already have the house, in which case, the argument is truly already resolved anyway. You would need to go through a refinance, etc, to get his name on the house after the fact.\n\nBut this is NTA, because he hasnt contributed financially at all in the process it sounds like, and his claim that this is \"financially abusive\" is complete hogwash, because for the fact is that he contributed nothing, so why should he expect something if you and him were to split up. \n\nI feel that hes only entitled only to what he contributed, and since he contributed nothing, he is entitled to nothing. Your request to him to get a job and contribute financially to the home if he wants to be on the mortgage and title is very mature and valid.", "NTA\n\nHe's a bit of a  mooch plain and simple.\n\nYou did the right thing.\n\nDon't be emotionally bullied into things.", "NTA and get a Cohabitation Agreement ASAP.", "NTA.

Don't let him manipulate you into putting his name on it -- IF you split, you'll have to divide the property with him, deal with all that mess, and either buy him out or move.\n\nI'm concerned that he's young, apparently able-bodied, not working, and living off you (housing and probably other expenses) and his parents.  If anyone in your relationship is being financially abused right now, it's you.  Is this a situation you're happy to have continue?

Again not a thing in all states but I would double check.", "NTA for putting only your name on it.  You are an AH for letting an unemployed leach move in with you.

You are with a person who would rather sponge off of other people - his parents, you, and anyone else he can - than to be a contributor to a partnership.

He's been unemployed for over 3 years now - and much of that time finding a job was not a difficult thing to do.  What has he been doing for all this time.  Let me guess, playing video games and hanging out with his pals?  He hasn't gotten \"around to finding a job\" because no one forced him too.  His parents supported him and he lived with you and you paid all the bills. \n\nYou need to make some decisions how to proceed here.  If he is adamant in wanting to be on the house deed, then you are going to be put in a tough situation.  What he calls financial abuse is really you trying to protect what you have earned on your own merits.  Really, what he wants is a form of financial abuse.  I'm afraid your partner is turning into a choosing beggar.  Don't let him get a foot in here.  He's afraid of breaking up and being left with nothing, but nothing is what he is putting into this purchase.

Alternatively, do you two plan to not get married but to live as lifelong partners (as in, you\u2019ve committed to this together verbally as you build a life together)? \n\nThis makes the difference to me on the situation. In the case of marriage or a committed and planned lifelong partnership (versus seeing how it goes and one day you look back and realize you have been boyfriends for 40 years), then I view everything as 50/50. A life intentionally built together, where sometimes one person\u2019s contributions cannot be assigned a number value but provide a significant contribution to family life that allows the other partner to focus on making the money they can. So, by default I extend this view to the 2 of you if it\u2019s how you view your relationship. \n\nHowever, if you 2 are still in the stage of being boyfriends that live together (versus looking at this as a family unit - you are young, it\u2019s very reasonable to have not made the ultimate commitment yet\u2026plus some people never want to make that commitment, which is also valid) then I don\u2019t think he should be on anything. You aren\u2019t purposefully building a life together yet and he isn\u2019t putting money into the purchase. He would never have an ownership stake if you guys were renting and had a landlord. So if you broke up, he would be left without anything because that\u2019s how renting works and how being boyfriends and/or girlfriends works. I don\u2019t understand in this situation why he would think he should have ownership. He isn\u2019t putting time into a family aspect *instead* of working on his career (that would be a sacrifice for the good of the family, which would deserve an ownership stake). Alternatively, if you guys view this as building a life together and one of you is facing physical or mental challenges at the moment which require time away from working to heal or because he can\u2019t or because he can but it makes life way more stressful - then in a lifelong commitment I also think this person deserves ownership stake. If he is going through what I just described but you guys don\u2019t view yourselves as a family unit yet, then you can still be a supportive partner that gives him a break by discounting his rent or covering it for him. He doesn\u2019t need an ownership stake in this case for you to be supportive of him. \n\nSo I lean towards NTA but if you guys have verbally committed to eachother as a family unit, that changes the situation for me.\n\nBest of luck and congratulations on your home!", "Nta-sounds like he\u2019s using you as housing and an atm-like he\u2019s using you as a sugar daddy- imo he shouldn\u2019t shouldn\u2019t be moving in with you till he has a job and has held it done for a while.
