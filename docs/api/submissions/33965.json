Well, not Maliyah or Jonathan (they're not really part of the conflict), just you and your wife.\n\nKarla should be paying her half of the bills, her ex should not have to chase her for money. She also shouldn't be letting her pride speak so loudly. She *never* should have potentially affected Maliyah's care because she's insulted. Karla also shouldn't be making large (unnecessary) financial decisions without consulting you. I don't know about the working situation that Karla has going, but if she's not paying her share and she's also not going to see her daughter enough, then there's a real issue there.\n\nBut you married a woman with a child with a child who has complex health needs. There was *always* a chance that Maliyah's medical bills would become the sole responsibility of your household. Children's health costs are a household bill like any other. You don't get to opt out completely just because not paying it doesn't affect *you*. \n\nYou need to communicate. Your wife needs to get over her pride, apologise to her ex, get the 50/50 deal back (or negotiate something else), and keep up with it. You need to sit down and have a serious look at both your financials and consider your future needs. You both need to have hard looks at yourself to decide what about you is willing to let a child potentially suffer for pride and money.", "NTA\n\nYour Karla sounds like a hot-head with an ego problem. You are absolutely not the A to refuse to cover her bets.", "NTA, I think you said it badly but I understand what you meant. She's been too far in her argument with her ex : they are talking about their child and she's ill. She can't includ you and your finances in her problems with her ex. She didn't pay the last time : she must apologize to him. \n\nShe's probably tired and she'd like you to be onher side but she's unreasonnable. If you can't financially handle it, she can't put your family into troubles to prove her ex she's financially able to take care of her child !", "YTA\n\nYou chose to marry a woman with kids. You chose to be a stepfather. A part of being a parent, step or not, is seeing to it your kids get the medical attention they need. This is part of the household expenses that you should have *always* been budgeting for.\n\nAnd you haven't been paying that 50% you owe. How hypocritcal to now insist on it when you're the ones that welshed.\n\nThis is quite literally what you signed up for.", "I honestly get the vibe that Johnathan wouldn\u2019t be mad if she couldn\u2019t afford the surgeries, but not coming to them recently as well? She\u2019s acting like a grade-A deadbeat. \n\nOf course, she boucles down when being called out and goes for the ever-classic approach of full responsibility even though the whole problem is her avoiding taking any to begin with.", "INFO: was Karla struggling to make the payments financially, or was she flaking? I do have to wonder at a 50/50 split if one parent makes significantly more than another, even with OP's added income. 50/50 may not be sustainable which means Karla needs to be an adult about this, and if she CAN'T pay, another arrangement may have to be considered. Is this part of a court ordered custody agreement? because that's going to limit the care her daughter needs based on HER income falling short. Dad could pick up the slack, so if that was the argument, then I have no idea why Karla would do the least logical thing to fix it.", "OP you married a woman who won't go support her daughter after surgery. She volunteered to pay full price so she wouldn't have to go support her daughter after surgery. She already won't pay even her part of the medical treatments.\n\nI honestly don't see how you can watch this and go \"I love this person.\" She won't even care for her own daughter, what's going to happen if you become ill? \n\nNTA, but this situation really should trigger a conversation of her reasoning and whether this is a red flag you're ignoring.", "IMHO, Jonathan played your wife, manipulating her into paying for all the medical expenses. \nInstead of just stopping to help her, it might be a better idea to convince her going back to the old agreement,  not letting wounded pride get in the way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they don't have the bills, call the hospital and ask for copies. \n\nUnless Jonathan already did that and is correct about Karla not contributing her share. In that case she's TA for trying to save face by making you pay for everything", "Wait what? What was the original argument. Was the ex paying 100% of the medical bills. This caused an argument so instead of going 50:50 she said screw you I'll pay for it on my own without you and without asking you? Is that correct.\n\nYou are right bill splitting should be 50:50 or if the ex is earning significantly more and is happy to pay more you pay portionately. Ie you pool the entire earnings and work out the percentage of how much each person earns and do an equal percentage of salary. So if ex earns 60% of the pooled income and is happy to he pays 60%.\n\nBut your wife seems to have been freeloading and now has had a hissy fit and taken all the expense without consulting you and expects you to now pay. If that is the case NTA. \n\nIf you are helping to pay you get a say in the discussion. Therefore the three of you come up with a decision together. If she doesn't let you have a seat at the table to discuss a huge financial burden and takes the full cost on the both of you without talking to you...you are NTA. For refusing to be a part of a decision you did not agree to. She doesn't get to make a huge decision on your shared income without consulting you first. So she takes on the burden alone. Absolutely a hill to die on. Personally I'd tell her she is bang out of order. And the three of you sit down together to make a reasonable agreement", "NTA\nTheir both being childish their child's medical expenses are not a game.", "NTA Karla needs to swallow her pride for Maliyah's and your sake so that Maliyah's medical expenses are covered with no issues. Karla has no right to put financial stress on you or to cast any doubt on whether Maliyah's medical expenses can be covered or not just because of her pride over one argument.\n\nThis a problem all of her own making.  Jonathan is at fault for accepting her prideful offer (assuming he did). You should not have to be the one who pays for your wife's prideful foolishness.\n\nThis is not a case of Maliyah being left to suffer, but your wife having to acknowledge that she acted irresponsibly and having to swallow her pride. Don't accept any framing of this as you putting Maliyah at risk. You didn't do that -- your wife did, and her ex is enabling it if he is going along with it.", "I don't understand your wife's logic.\n\nHer ex accused her of not paying her share or spending her share of time with her kid.\n\nShe insisted that she does.\n\nTo \"prove\" that to him, she insisted she'd take 100% responsibility for their child.\n\nWhy... why not start documenting expenses on their child and time spent with her and use that to prove she does her share?\n\nUnless she doesn't...", "Are you saying that your wife wasn\u2019t pulling her weight with her own daughter, not paying and not even emotionally and physically supporting her daughter during hospital stays?
