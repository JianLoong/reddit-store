You should not have to be the one who pays for your wife's prideful foolishness.\n\nThis is not a case of Maliyah being left to suffer, but your wife having to acknowledge that she acted irresponsibly and having to swallow her pride.

The mothers lower income could delay procedures, force doctor changes, and cause other extreme changes if she can't afford to keep the daughter where she was before.\n\nIf a child has extensive medical issues, I'd think a parent would want to give that child both a high standard of care and keep them as happy as possible.

That relationship could make a medical condition that is both incomprehensible and life altering for a child a bit more bearable because they trust those who are treating them.\n\nNot to mention, a child would be treated with Pediatric doctors. Pediatrics is a completely separate class because it deals with a child's constantly changing body instead of an already finished growing adults body. I'll use cardiolgy as an example. Pediatric cardiology is different from adult cardiology. While adults may have issues with blocked coronary arteries or valve diseases, Pediatric cardiology usually works with congenital heart defects or structural issues within the heart.\n\nIn addition, Pediatric doctors have been scarce since before COVID for many reasons. They're not as profitable as regular doctors, might not get as good of a wage or as much respect as their adult treating equivalents, and hospitals have been cutting out their pediatric divisions en masse. COVID made this even worse, so Maliyah could potentially require care from a hard to find specialized pediatric treatment center that is booked with patients out into the next year.
