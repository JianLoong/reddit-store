She told me that she wished she'd gotten to taste my cooking skills instead. I was like I can't cook well at all. She said I should jusy return her kindnese and not try to buy my way in. I was speechless and I just froze in my spot. The lady didn't say anything else and left. \n\n\nI was really upset and no matter how much I want to let go of this I wasn't able to.

We don't give gifts to get them in return and you'd already returned the kindness. Great if she wants to make pies for her neighbours but that doesn't mean everyone else will or can. Honestly I'd refuse any future gifts from her as they aren't really a friendly gesture if she expects something in return each time", "NTA\n\nThe first pie seems like a normal \"welcome to the neighbourhood\" gift, but there was no reason for her to give you a second pie other than to make the comment about your thank you gift.  \n\nIf she brings a third pie I'd make it clear to her that she won't be receiving any pies from you in return no matter how many baked goods she tries to foist on you.", "Ew what? Absolutely NTA. Buy your way in to what?? What a weird neighbor. She didn\u2019t HAVE to bake you anything just like you didn\u2019t HAVE to get her a gift. \n\nMaybe your wife has the better idea of not liking social interactions \ud83d\ude02 \n\nBut no seriously you are not in the wrong at all. Either leave another little gift and talk to her about what she meant\u2026.or cook her something disgusting in return lol", "NTA. You didn\u2019t have to give anything back at all and you were nice enough to get her something. Trying to dictate a gift like that is wild", "NTA but that neighbor sounds judgmental and that second gifted pie comes across as passive aggressive. I would limit my interactions with her in the future", "NTA\n\nIt was nice of her to bring you a pie, but when you give an unsolicited gift to someone you don't really know, it's kind of crazy to expect anything in return, and you certainly don't get to dictate what they do give you (if anything at all) back.  \n\nNot everyone likes baking or has time for it.  You got her a gift, that's plenty.", "NTA just ghost her. Literally don\u2019t give her the time of day or any explanation. She sounds so set in her ways and you already explained you don\u2019t cook well! And the fact that she think you even have time to try to cook her something is extremely annoying imo", "NTA Your neighbor sounds like an unpleasant person, especially since you did give her a gift in return. Not everyone can bake.", "NTA. Yikes! What a train wreck of an allegedly kind act on her part ruined by her discourteous words. Did you eat the second pie?\n\nWhen you leave the neighborhood, return her \"favors\" by giving her a parting gift, an etiquette book for dumb people, maybe with relevant sections tabbed and highlighted.", "NTA She gave you the pie first without you knowing she wanted something in return. It seems like since you have her something in return for the first pie, she's trying to see if you'll give a little more since she \"gifted\" you a second one.\n\nIf she tries to give you another pie reject it. Tell her she can't cook her way into your family", "NTA.  It wasn\u2019t necessary to buy her anything, a nice thank you note would have been more appreciate.  But her reaction was still very odd, bringing another pie over seemingly as a pretense for asking you to cook/bake something for her and then making such an unfounded judgment of you.", "No, you were not a jerk and you're NTA. We all have different abilities. This lady likes to cook. You can not cook. You returned her kindness in a different way. Her looking up her nose at that was just OTT ... rude? Entitled? I don't know the word I'm looking for. Let's go with \"bad.\"", "NAH, I think this is just a misunderstanding. My guess is that she was saying that *if* you felt like you needed to give something in return, she would prefer that you cook her something rather than buy something. I give people a lot of homemade food, and I would feel weird if they bought me a gift in return. If they don't give me anything that's totally cool, and if they give me something they made (not necessarily food, could be a drawing or something) then that's great.", "NTA\n\nMy goodness, your neighbor is extremely passive aggressive.  Returning a gift was thoughtful.  Yes, custom is that you return a baked item for a baked item, but her reaction is over the top.  \n\nPeople here are going to have lots of suggestions about how to respond.  Just remember that whatever you do will color your relationship with this neighbor. Are the other neighbors just as crazy?  Or is she the designated crazy neighbor on your street?\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis sounds *exactly* how Christian culture was when I was growing up. She is trying to one-up you with kindness and establish a moral dominance. It's definitely her own game she is playing, you don't have to participate.", "Holy crap, NTA!! AND HOW RUDE OF THE NEIGHBOR. \n\nNot everyone can cook. And not everyone has the time to cook for people outside their home. I would NEVER have expected someone to return my cooking with theirs, and would have been delighted to get anything in response at all. She's made this transactional all on her own.\n\nI would ignore her and if she tries to offer you another pie, politely refuse and say that you'd rather she doesn't try to buy her way in again.", "NTA.  Return the kindness and make her a pie.  You can\u2019t cook. It will be inedible.   She won\u2019t be able to say a thing due to \u2018manners.\u2019 \n\nBe saccharine sweet about it.  \u201cWhy, golly me, I took your advice and I tried reeeeeally hard to make you this pie.  Spent hours on it!!\u201d\n\nDo yourself a petty favour and over salt the pastry.", "Well, NTA, but custom dictated that you return the plate with goodies on it.  I\u2019m an old bat, and I barely remember this social etiquette rule.  The \u2018lady,\u2019 and I use the term loosely, is a jerk.", "NTA I doubt she wants to taste your cooking out of curiosity, she probably wants to judge and gossip about it like it's 1954.", "NTA. This lady seems really horribly judgmental and insulting. But hey, if she insists, you could always make her a very \"special\" pie, like in the book/movie \"The Help.\" \ud83d\ude01", "Nta, but you know you totally have to make her a pie now, right? A terrible, tasteless, disgusting pie full of nonsensical ingredients that don't go together, spent feelings and passive aggression\ud83d\udc4c", "NTA\n\nI don't know if this is a Midwestern thing, but I was taught that you never return a dish empty. I've also never known anyone who does that in real life.", "NTA.  Everyone gives what they can and this lady was insulting.", "NTA. But, hear me out....make her a pie. At your absolute lowest skill level. Burn that crust. Leave lumps in the filling. Do your worst. \"I told you I can't cook, but you insisted, so...\"", "When you can\u2019t let something go through the emotional/intellectual route, you have to let it go the mechanical route. Go punch a pillow, take a drive and just scream, or my personal favorite, get a cardboard box and a stick and play home run derby with the box. Use some mechanical means to get it off your mind.\n\nThis whole thing is so small, it\u2019s below the level of nanoassholes. Just don\u2019t worry about her, and do whatever you need to get over it. I totally understand the frustration, but there is no winning here. And no losing, except for time lost worrying about it.", "NTA. A gift with strings attached is not a gift.", "NTA, the neighbor was.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As in, did we somehow get off the list?  We are really missing your food-item!\n\nIt's nice if people return jars, but I don't think anybody's ever given me anything back in return, except for when people start dropping off large bags of pickling size cucumbers. Which is a welcome gift because they are expensive.  (I live in a rural area. So a lot of people grab stuff from farm stands or grow it themselves and drop stuff off at the house.)\n\nWhile people do think of me, and buy pickle sized cucumbers, they also share other kinds of produce, again because I live in a rural area.  \n\nI have never considered my sharing of food to be a tit for tat relationship.
