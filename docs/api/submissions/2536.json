However, this morning, I mentioned how I love how my nipples feel now and he asked how did I come to the decision to retire them. \n\nI explained that when I had them pierced, it was because I didn\u2019t like how I looked - but now, I do. \n\nHe said \u201cso my opinion doesn\u2019t matter?\u201d \nI said \u201cit does but when I saw you the day after taking them out, you said you liked them so I thought you approved.\u201d \n\nHis tone changed and he said, \u201cso everybody got to have them and play with them before and now I\u2019m the one who has to do without them.\u201d \n\nMind you - he\u2019s been with me the longest and only 2 other people has seen my piercings before him. \n\nI hung up on him after he said that and he called back immediately and apologized but scolded me for doing it anyway. \n\nI keep replaying this in my head but I can\u2019t help but wonder if I\u2019m an asshole for not making it clear that I don\u2019t want to put them back? \n\nI also have multiple other piercings that I have grown tired of - and plan to retire.
