{"id": 10285, "submission_id": "115h37i", "title": "AITA For making my mother lose custody of my nephew?", "selftext": "This morning, I (29M) had a rude awakening by my mother (61F) pounding on my bedroom's door telling me to \"get up\". Got up, went to the kitchen and she told me to sit down, and then she explained how just 15 minutes ago she was visited by 2 police officers and 2 agents from CPS to take my nephew (1M) to a municipal shelter. I was already expecting this to happen but figured I would have a few weeks more of lead time.\n\nIn any case, what happens is, my sister (28F) had a son early last year, and since she was admitted to the hospital giving premature birth, had not done any prenatal care whatsoever and was involved in substance abuse, the hospital reported it to CPS, who took her son away to a shelter. I knew this would happen eventually and I knew my mother would step in because \"he's blood and flesh and you don't separate blood and flesh\". However I didn't expect it would go as bad as it did. \n\nFor starters, my sister decided not to name the father in the birth certificate, despite the guy owing up to it. He helped out for a few months and when he saw he was off the hook, he vanished. At the same time, my mother quit her job to look after my nephew, leaving he brunt of the house's expenses with me. She said my sister would be moving in and would be getting a job. She did move in, put 0 effort in getting a job and even less in helping around the house. Bear in mind, this is old style shared living (boarding house), which is much less than ideal but you play the cards you're dealt.\n\nFast forward to April, my mom has been granted custody over my nephew and he is living with us. Fast forward again to November and my mother has another relapse into alcoholism, skips out on 15 days of work and I report it to the CPS agent responsibly for my nephew's case. Come December I am once again with my finances severely strained and just after new years, again my mother decides that \"a little drink couldn't hurt\", and skips on a whole month of work. Again I reported it to CPS.\n\nIt's now early February, somehow my mother hasn't lost her job, and has started (FINALLY!) seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist, meanwhile we get a court summons to speak to the court's social assistant regarding my nephew, his care and the current living arrangments. I tell the truth about my mother's alcoholism, how I'm worried that properly caring for my nephew is beyond her capabilities (she's 61 years old, smokes, has trouble with alcohol), how I also cannot look after him (I'm almost 30, barely make enough to keep my head out of water) and how my sister is still unfit (hasn't even bothered getting a job and it's not clear wether she's still abusing substances or not).\n\nThe social services person told me it was very likely they would step in and take him back to a shelter and in the long run, he will likely be up for adoption. This morning they came and took my nephew and I've finished burrying whatever relationship I had left with my mother and sister.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1676732175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115h37i/aita_for_making_my_mother_lose_custody_of_my/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t know how things will go, but in my experience as a therapist working with a lot of people that are involved in CPS cases, if you want to get your kid back they will work with you to make a plan to get your kid back. You will have to show and prove with home inspections, drug tests, parenting classes, keeping jobs etc, but if they want it they can do it.", "NTA.

You told the truth about what you saw that could endanger your nephew's safety. She made herself lose custody based on her own poor choices. Maybe she will start making better choices so she can stay in his life. \n\nIf I was an adoptive parent, I like to think that as long as the child's relatives didn't endanger his safety, I would let them remain in contact.

You should however move out as fast as you possibly can, these two women are wearing you down and preventing you from having a 'normal' life.
