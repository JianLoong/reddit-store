Tell her that you're happy to start planning her Sweet Sixteen with her next year.\n\nIf she keeps pushing back, I think you might also want to talk to some of her friends' mums--the parents who've thrown the quinces she's been going to--and see what they have to say about a quince vs a Sweet Sixteen for your daughter. I'd also ask her why a quincea\u00f1era specifically rather than just a birthday party. Is it the big fancy dress? The specific traditions like food, music, etc? Is she just feeling bad that she's been invited to all these big fancy parties and she won't have the opportunity to return the courtesy?", "NTA\nI am not Hispanic and my knowledge about Hispanic beliefs is very lacking, but wanting one because the daughter thinks of it as just a party is quite a faulty thought process, as she probably only sees it as a cool party with no cultural background, but\u2026\nAt the end of the day, only a Hispanic person or party can make the right call, as it\u2019s their tradition and their right to say who can celebrate for what reasons.", "NTA\n\nThe quince\u00f1era is meant to be a celebration of a child turning into a young woman. They used to be only for the wealthy then they became more common. Part of the reason families are able to afford these extravagant parties is because they ask people to be god parents, padrinos or madrinas. These individuals, usually couples, pay or subsidize part of the cost. Usually you\u2019ll get a godparent to pay for the dress, another for the venue, etc. Then, similar to a wedding, there\u2019s a court and they do a valz, basically it takes a lot to plan. \n\nI suggest you have a conversation with your daughter and ex and explain all of that. As well as talking about what you can do to celebrate her birthday, if you don\u2019t want to celebrate turning into a woman. You can do a sweet 16, some teens are also into exclusive type events like renting out a bowling alley, so there\u2019s options since quince\u00f1eras are usually for Latinos/Latinx individuals.\n\nEdit: I read all the comments and some people are saying yes there\u2019s cultural appropriation and some saying ask the families of her friends, there\u2019s one that mentioned quince\u00f1eras being a celebration for the birthday with no cultural anything tied to it.\n\nMy family is from Mexico, all of the quince\u00f1eras I\u2019ve been to (I didn\u2019t get one) had a religious component to it. There was always a mass beforehand that the family and guests attended. Of course all the Spanish speaking countries have different traditions so this is just one piece of the whole puzzle. I still suggest to go another route u less the families don\u2019t feel offended.", "NTA. If she's not Hispanic, then this is cultural appropriation. It's like throwing a bat mitzvah if you're not Jewish.", "The NTA is a very American response. I\u2019m first generation Guatemalan and I  love that she loves our culture and wants a Quince. Traditionally it\u2019s tied to the Catholic religion including a mass prior to the reception.

I didn't care much so we opt for a sweet 16. \n\nNTA but also slightly AH because yes it's a cultural thing but also not a big deal people. It's a big deal if you make it one and this case it isn't.

Sounds like she wants a \"princess for a day\" party before her wedding day, basically. Tell her she can have \"just a party,\" or a Sweet Sixteen next year (which begs another question, is she expecting a quinceanera this year and a Sweet Sixteen next year?), but she can't pick and choose aspects of other cultures just for fun. She's old enough to learn that people can get deeply hurt and offended by this, and to be respectful of other people's feelings and cultures.\n\nEDIT: Guys, y'all are missing the point lol. Yes, it's no longer seen as announcing a woman is ready to be married. However, that doesn't mean it's not still seen as a coming-of-age party to a lot of people, much like a Sweet Sixteen. The part I found potentially worrisome was that it sounds like daughter has no interest in following Hispanic culture, she just wants to pick and choose this expensive thing from culture a, and this expensive flashy party from culture b just because she wants to feel spoiled for a day. That's the definition of cultural appropriation, which some people can have really, really strong feelings about. I think teaching our kids to be sensitive to other people's feelings about their cultures is not a bad thing. That was my main point.\n\nTake me, for instance. My family has enough Native American blood on both sides that we could be registered, if we had all the appropriate paperwork. But if little blond-haired, blue-eyed me were to dress in buckskin for Halloween, I'm pretty sure I'd get side-eyed and judged for it.", "Info: are you or your ex Hispanic? \n\nIf so, it seems appropriate.

It traditionally signifies when a girl is ready for marriage, maybe explain to her the history and learn some things about it together, go out for some traditional food and celebrate but explain to her how because it\u2019s not part of her culture it may not be entirely appropriate even though she has the best intentions at heart \ud83d\ude42", "NTA I'd equate it to would you be the A for not throwing your daughter a bat mitzvah if you're not jewish.", "NTA.

I approached far too many deeply important and meaningful cultural traditions as just being fun party or as an excuse to hang out with my friends. I didn\u2019t *feel* like I was appropriating their culture and I genuinely cared about the people I was with, so it didn\u2019t seem inappropriate.

But that person's parent or grandparent may be offended to hear that because it meant something different to them.", "The term \"white\" is confusing because it means the perception of the color of someone's skin, but it's also a culture. White people culture is things like boy scouts or girl scouts, Christmas but not church, going camping as a free or low cost activity, or believing that capitalism is the same thing as democracy. It's weird and uncomfortable to acknowledge the existence of \"White people culture\" because it only exists because there are people living in America whose ancestors were forcibly relocated and now they're known as \"black people\" and so it feels a little gross to even acknowledge. But quincineras are not a White people culture thing, and that's why it's possibly culturally inappropriate for her to ask to have her own. It's nice that she wants to participate in other cultures festivals and ceremonies, but it's also a little insensitive for a White person to want to own another cultures traditions. I would probably ask my daughter's friends' moms for their guidance on handling this with my daughter since all the girls are going to be talking about it anyway.", "Just so you know, there are plenty of people who would look white who are actually Hispanic or Latino. I mean Spain is Hispanic and white. Skin tone doesn't really signify if you are Latino as much as where you are actually from. Kinda like the movie Encanto. I know it is a cartoon and Disney but they did a pretty good job of showing that Latino families can come in many different colors. \n\nAlso, Quinceaneras are more of a Latino thing and not Hispanic thing. Someone please correct me if I am wrong, but I am pretty sure they are celebrated in Brazil but not typically in Spain unless it is a Latino immigrant family.", "That\u2019s a better answer.   Because saying we don\u2019t celebrate this because we are white implies that there being white excludes also being Hispanic", "Because one can be both white and Hispanic at the same time.", "Not saying the person is racist but the remark shows a level of not understanding.", "Una quincea\u00f1era pertenece a una cultura de que ella no es. End of discussion \u2764\ufe0f", "Yeah in Brazil we kinda have that weird split. I grew up learning it that way in school. Still fucks me up to have to constantly remind myself that Brazilians are included when others speaks of Latinos...", "I'm very much Hispanic and literally had a quincea\u00f1era lmao you don't know me so sit down and don't try it. Talking about me saying nonsense when you're going this hard to defend white girls having a quince, who are you to decide they can have it?", "Again, no one blocked you. Maybe in your imaginary world where you think you're always right, but not here. \ud83d\ude01 And nope they aren't the same, next.", ">Quinces are not the same as bar mitzvahs, damn.\n\nThey're both coming of age events only practiced by their own cultures. It may not be a 1 to 1 comparison but it's still apt.\n\nI grew up in a small farming town that was majority Hispanic and if some white girl had tried to throw herself a quincea\u00f1era hands would have ended up being thrown.\n\nI'm glad you have no problem with this girl wearing your culture like it's a halloween party but there are plenty who would have a problem with it.", ">Her brushing it off and being dismissive calling it \"just a party\n\nI'm saying the same damn thing, am I being disrespectful? \n\n>especially of younger generations\n\nIt has nothing to do with younger or oler generations.", "Nobody said a person can\u2019t be both. OP literally just stated she was not Hispanic and is white. You are jumping to imply she stated that they are mutually exclusive", "No, no es el fin de la discusi\u00f3n. Quincea\u00f1era es una fiesta de quince y nada m\u00e1s. \n\nYo, c\u00f3mo latina que soy le doy permiso \ud83d\ude18", "I re-read her response and I stick with my first instinct.   \u201cNeither of us are Hispanic.  We are white\u201d.", "Yo,otra latina,y litera nacida y criada en Am\u00e9rica Latina, tambi\u00e9n le doy permiso."]}
