Should she have to now split it up to give op\u2019s daughter an equal share? Can\u2019t have her feeling left out, now can we? After all she\u2019s the girl\u2019s stepmother, the girl has every right to her money, right?\n\nWRONG!!! The only people financially responsible for a child, legally or other otherwise, are their 2 parents. A stepparent is NOT a parent or an adoptive parent. It is a social title bestowed on the spouse of a parent. This person has no legal standing in this sense. \n\nWhat happens if there\u2019s no money to send the boys to college? Should op refuse to send his daughter to college? Or should he be forced to pay for all 3? \n\nThe boys have 2 functioning parents. What they can and cannot afford is their problem. If it\u2019s not enough, both of them need to get better paying or second jobs. Those boys are THEIR responsibility. The daughter is OP\u2019s responsibility. The family may be blended but finances shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s a totally different dynamic from an intact original family.\n\nI\u2019ve seen many single parents marry again to a wealthy spouse just to get a piece of that pie. For God\u2019s sake, future stepparents, if you have money and insist on marriage with a parent who doesn\u2019t have money, make it clear up front they will be getting a job and supporting their own kids. And get a prenup. I\u2019ve seen too many people (mostly men) end up supporting their spouse, their spouse\u2019s kids, paying off their spouses debt, possibly even their child support, and end up with their nest egg depleted to the point of nonexistence.\n\nWhat\u2019s with these people who think they have a right to someone else\u2019s hard earned money to take care of THEIR responsibilities?? What\u2019s with you people that think this is ok?? If you have a child it\u2019s your and the other parent\u2019s responsibility, I don\u2019t care who you\u2019re married to.", "Why even marry someone with kids if you\u2019re going to behave this way.

Your wife wants you go either pay for her kids to go to private school ( which her kids don't even care about) or make your daughter go to a public school.\n\nThey aren't young children..they are older teenagers established at their schools and with their friends.\n\nDO NOT REMOVE YOUR DAUGHTER FROM HER SCHOOL\n\nYour wife and her ex need to pay for private school if that's what they want for their kids. Demanding you pay for it or sacrifice your daughter is wrong. Don't listen to others on here telling you that's okay and needs to be done to be fair. They are not your kids. They came into your life much later. Both of their parents are still alive and are making no effort to get or buy the things they want for their kids ..instead they see you have some money and want a share of that at the expense of your child. That's not okay on any level.", "YTA - my mother married a man like you when I was young. Always spoiled his daughter rotten. My brother and I got hand me downs, and told not to eat anything tasty because it was his and his daughters (by tasty I mean real cheese on a sandwich rather than the processed crap bought for my brother and I). By the age of 15 I had to start working 25+ hours a week plus school so I could provide clothing and pay for school things myself. His daughter's stuff was always bought. The kicker, she got school loans for college that I was denied, because even though he never supported my brother and I, I lived in the same house as her father.\n\nIt caused lots of resentment and fights between my step sister and I.

If you were not doing as well as you are, would she still have married you? \n\nShe is totally going to expect you to give her children the life you give your child. But they are not your children.\n\nBefore getting married did the two of you sit down and talk about who is responsible for what relating to your children? Did she know going into the marriage that she is responsible for her children (along with her ex) while you and your ex are responsible for your daughter? Or was there no conversation ahead of time on financial expectations relating to the children and she is expecting you to add her kids on your funding plan?\n\nIf there was no discussion before getting married there should have been. Did you get a prenup? This could get ugly real quick. You need to step back and evaluate everything and think about the future.", "NTA & I don\u2019t understand why so many think you are. The boys have 2 parents who are alive and responsible. Your daughter has 1. Its on them to care for their kids and ensure they live within their means & sometimes that means no luxuries for a while but that\u2019s okay as long as they\u2019re taken care of otherwise (necessities like food, clothes, school etc). If you\u2019re rubbing in the boys faces or mistreating them on purpose then you\u2019d also be an AH. \n\nI do want to know if your wife has contributed to your daughters anything as well because if she wants to be blended + have 2 men provide for her children then she needs to step up for yours too.", "NTA\n\nOP is right, in my opinion. Just because you blend families doesn't mean you are reponsible for your spouse's children, particularly when their other parent is in the picture.

Your daughter was already used to this type of lifestyle and you even went so far as to get a vasectomy to ensure she would remain your only child so that you can maintain that lifestyle. You are under no obligation to pay for her children to go to school. If she wants better things for her kids, then she can go get a better job. This is something that your wife knew before you married.

You can\u2019t want someone to be hands off with your kids but still want them to spoil them. Your wife sounds like my step grandmother, her grandkids lived with my grandpa and her but heaven forbid he tried to discipline them or set rules in his own house. That was simply not allowed. If I were you though I wouldn\u2019t have married a woman who wants you to just be an atm to her kids and not a stepdad so maybe it\u2019s more of an ESH if you didn\u2019t discuss this before hand.", "NTA.  While the tone of this comes across poorly, I think the general idea of parents financially supporting their own kids in a blended family isn\u2019t uncommon.  Is the wife\u2019s ex going to support OPs daughter? I\u2019m guessing of course not because it\u2019s not his kid and he has no connection.  So that would mean the 2 sons have 3 adults supporting them while OPs daughter has 1 (maybe 2 if the wife does, but it sounds like she doesn\u2019t.)\n\nAnd while the Y T A are overwhelming, I think if OP did what so many are suggesting and the daughter posted her side, everyone would be going overboard to support her.

I would treat her kids nice & with respect, but they are not entitled to what you do for & give to your daughter.\nEdit to add: if it was the boys' father posting saying that the stepdad should be paying for his sons to go to private school & paying for brand name clothes, etc, everyone would be telling him that he & his boys aren't entitled to the stepdad's money & what the stepdad does for his own daughter.", "NTA, but maybe a bit\n\nI understand your daughter is special to you, and you don't have the same bond with your wife's kids.

If you are expected to parent them by providing financial resources, it is also expected that you get to be a parent in settings household boundaries, rules, and responsibilities.

We *do* all have an innate instinct to protect children, or at least want them to be safe, because that promotes the continuation of our species.

The fact that this attitude is common amongst the childfree community makes me wonder if there\u2019s something more that this adds than society acknowledges.

It's not always easy, but like...it's actually fairly fun. He's both a friend and my kid, but like I know a big part of that is personality. He warmed up to me after I told him I grew up playing roblox too.

The point is, your life now revolves around three other people, and at least one of them \nprobably wishes you weren\u2019t there.) \n\nPlus, you have no say in anything regarding the child, even when they\u2019re in your home. Kid is overtired and needs to go to bed early? It\u2019s not bedtime and you\u2019re not the parent. Kid is being a little jerk and you\u2019d like to do a timeout? Nope.

Tough luck, buttercup; the clothes belong to the child (which is fair). What Mommy chooses to send her back in is none of your business. \n\nI\u2019ve heard there are couples that can actually behave like adults in custody situations and keep everything cordial, at least for the kids\u2019 sake, but clearly that hasn\u2019t been my experience.

I\u2019m an auntie to eight bonus nieces and nephews, and it\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m actually closer to some of them than some of my blood niblings. (I hate that word, but it is useful.) Two of them are also my godchildren, which was *such* an honor. Plus I get to be that adult that they know they can turn to, no matter what, no matter when, no judgement and no questions asked. Unless it\u2019s something their parents *need* to know (like s3lf h@rm, etc), whatever we talk about stays between us. \n\nThe eldest is in college now, and calls me when she gets homesick, or when she needs advice about something she doesn\u2019t want to ask her mom about. One of the younger ones just started middle school and is having a rough adjustment, so I make sure we text at least twice a week and he knows I\u2019m thinking about him. \n\nA stepparent is, IME, a different animal. You have to walk a fine line between parent and babysitter. You don\u2019t have the same level of leeway that you do as an auntie or a \u201cfuncle.\u201d Let\u2019s face it, kids have big mouths and zero filters. They never mean to squeal on you, but they get excited and things just come out. Lol! Having donuts for breakfast or going on an adventure are really fun things to do, but once they gets back to the parents, (and they will eventually), chances are good at least one of them is going to have something to say about it.", "I am great friends with my daughter\u2019s step mom- we had a girls weekend last weekend and had a blast.  She is good to my daughter and I love her for that!", "Honestly the stepparents sub is definitely a mixed bag - but it\u2019s also a good, unfiltered look at what life is generally like being a stepparent. \n\nOf course it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s situation but the reality is relationships between people who share  children rarely end well or amicably. Sure it happens, but it\u2019s the outlier. Usually one or both parties involved is bitter about the relationship ending, and the child(ren) become tools to hurt the other parent and any other adult who becomes involved with either parent.\n\nObviously people have good experiences, but the sad reality is more often then not it\u2019s not the case. Plus the people who *do* have these good relationships don\u2019t realize they\u2019re only one bad situation from things blowing up at any given moment. All it takes is one conversation, one conflict between the bio parents, one of them breaks up with their partner and wants to get back with your spouse, and whatever cordial balance you thought you had flies out the window.\n\nStepparenting *only* works when both bio parents are healthy, well adjusted adults, and people forget that if they *were* both mature people, they probably wouldn\u2019t have split in the first case. Again, of course there are outliers, but they are the exception, not the rule. So odds are at least one of the bio parents is going to be a headache.\n\nThat\u2019s not even including split custody. Your life is not your own. Other parent has a last minute emergency, but you and your spouse had out of town plans? Not anymore you don\u2019t. You found the perfect house but the other parents take you to court and stalls the move and the house gets sold to someone else? Sucks to be you. Say anything about any of it and you become the villain, because it\u2019s easier to focus the frustration on you, not the other parent they can\u2019t control.\n\nI would *never* suggest a child free person become a step parent. NEVER. \n\nEven if the kid is absolutely great, you lose so much control of your own life I don\u2019t think people grasp what that actually means until they are multiple years into it. And your right, usually one party absolutely hates your guts simply for existence and people have no idea how that wears you down. Giving control of your life to someone who hates you is a recipe for failure and people fail to realize in most cases that\u2019s *exactly* what you\u2019re doing.\n\nIt\u2019s not the kids fault, but it doesn\u2019t change it.", "I'm 14 years into raising 2 amazing kids that I didn't give birth to. My story is way different than most, though. Their bio mom dropped them on my FILs porch and said she couldn't \"do this.\" \n\nThose babies were 2(f) and 9mo(m). Literally just babies. My husband has had full custody since. Bio will pop up once in a while, asking my oldest (25 now) for money or ask our son (23 now) to watch his half brothers who live 4 hours away. \n\nMy husband and I added our own bio 10(f), and I've never treated any of them differently other than age appropriate things. Our girls are best friends. Our son is an amazing rugby player on scholarship. I love being a mom. None of us even say \"step x\" anymore.\n\nMy story is definitely an outlier in these cases, though. I recognize that, and I'm super grateful for our little family we've built. \ud83d\udda4", "And the reality is our situations are much more common then the people who have the fairy tale everyone\u2019s happy blended families. They either haven\u2019t been in the relationship long/don\u2019t live together, both bio parents have long since separated and the animosity is over and both have new partners, both bio parents are mature adults and don\u2019t parent from a place of guilt or jealousy, or the kids are either still very young or older teenagers.\n\nI genuinely hope they all continue to thrive in their happy blended families.\n\nBut they are the exception. Off the internet almost all step parents I talk to (I\u2019m in a front facing hospitality job so I talk to *alot*) at the very best had no clue what they were signing up for and given the chance most would not do it again.\n\nPeople underestimated how much having little to no control over your own life erodes you over time.\n\nEven if you love your spouse, the situation often still results in a break up because the stress of a constant 3rd party involved in your every day life who most likely can\u2019t stand you and kids or who may or may not like you is untenable.\n\nI\u2019ve been with my SO most of a decade now, and we\u2019ve only survived because I ended up getting my own apartment. If I was still having every moment of every day dictated by a woman he dated for like a year 13 years ago and by proxy their child I would\u2019ve shot myself into a black hole by now.\n\nI envy the people that are happy as clams, but I wish they would acknowledge their situations aren\u2019t how it usually works out, and be honest with people considering getting involved in these types of relationships. The irony is most of them don\u2019t realize they have literally no power in their own relationship and a few fights between the bio parents, or sudden problems with the child is all it would take to completely blow up their lives. \n\nIt\u2019s like we all are living in a minefield, but only some of us seem to realize it\u2019s full of landmines while others just walk through oblivious.", "My opinion on this probably isn't worth very much since I absolutely want kids, but I would think childfree refers to someone who *intends* to be permanently without kids. Not necessarily that there is no situation ever that could change that, but they are not open to changing their mind as far as their free choice in the matter.\n\nMost childfree people don't hate kids, many of them are happy to be involved with the children of siblings or friends on a temporary basis that doesn't imply long term responsibility. People who don't want children because they outright dislike them would also be childfree, but a minority of the group, and further described by other labels like antinatalist depending on the extremity of their views.\n\nBut I feel like it would be extreme to say someone can't be childfree unless they're unwilling to take responsibility for a kid under any circumstances. If someone says I don't want to make a kid, I don't want to adopt a kid, I don't want to take on a stepkid, I think it that is enough to make them childfree. They could still speculate that if a *specific* child they already know came into extreme need such as by being orphaned, and there were no good alternatives, they might step up rather than let them go into a worse situation. But that's the duress of an extreme event."]}
