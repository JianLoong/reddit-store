{"id": 17928, "submission_id": "13oubxj", "title": "AITA for over reacting over a harmless mosquito prank?", "selftext": "I (21f) am terrified of mosquitoes. I hate them, don\u2019t want to be anywhere near them. I was with a group of my friends recently, when \u201cNed\u201d decided to play a prank on me. He kept telling me there\u2019s a mosquito near me, and I started panicking on instinct. He stopped pretty soon because I think seeing me scream and panic scared him. \n\nBut then he said it was a harmless prank because who is so scared of mosquitoes? You can just crush them. It doesn\u2019t make sense to him. It was all in good fun. \n\nI had a few choice words for him. \u201cHow could you\u201d and \u201casshole\u201d being among them. \n\nBut I\u2019m from a tropical country, which means dengue and malaria exist. When I was 10, I got both simultaneously. Yes, you can get dengue and malaria at the same time. I almost died. 0/10 experience, do not recommend. My parents were told on multiple occasions to prepare for the worst. \n\nThat was so traumatic for me that even at 21, I\u2019m terrified of mosquitoes. I will cry and panic if you tell me there\u2019s one near me and I can\u2019t see it/ get rid of it.  \n\nWell Ned didn\u2019t know all of this extra information, he just knew I\u2019m terrified of mosquitoes. He says he wishes I told him all of this before because he wouldn\u2019t have done it if he knew. \n\nIm of the opinion a friend (or even a decent person) wouldn\u2019t need to know why you\u2019re scared of something in order to deem that fear acceptable. \n\nMy friend group is pretty evenly split. Some of them are on my side and others think I should cut him some slack because mosquitoes are a \u201cniche\u201dfear.", "created_utc": 1684769878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13oubxj/aita_for_over_reacting_over_a_harmless_mosquito/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ned was being AH, trying to bother you. Whether or not he knows the reason for your aversion to mosquitos - and I'd say it's a darn good reason - when somebody is going out of his way to bother another person he doesn't get to complain about your (reasonable) reaction to being bothered.", "NTA. You should never make fun of or pull pranks on someone else's fear, regardless if you think it's real or rationalized or not. He didn't need to know why, being your friend means respecting someone's boundaries, including fears. He should be the one apologizing, not you. He isn't a friend if he is going to make fun of your fears like that.", "nta, I hate a \u201cyou should\u2019ve told me the full extent of your trauma so I could\u2019ve truly respected you\u201d trope", "NTA.  It doesn't matter if something is a \"niche\" fear, it's still a valid fear, and it's never OK to use someone's fear as the basis for a prank.", "Nta. Pranks in general are AH behavior. Why do you need to have fun at someone\u2019s else\u2019s expense? Some of Your friends are jerks.", "I hate the entire concept of \u201cpranks\u201d that are based on fucking around with someone\u2019s fears. It\u2019s a dick thing to do. You\u2019re NTA.", "Because of your experience, I can understand why you are afraid of mosquitoes.\n\nBut it is seems like a true phobia.  You literally cannot avoid them in the warm months, even in the daylight if you just happen to walk by a small pool of water or bush.\n\nYou should go see a therapist and try to work through this past-traumatic experience.\n\nMosquitoes are EVERYWHERE, and there are other bugs that fly and bite even worse, like horse flies.\n\nFor the vast majority of people mosquitoes are an annoyance (even as they are a disease vector), not a phobia. IMO cut your friend some slack now that you have explained it to him.", "NTA", "NAH. He played a relatively harmless prank. You freaked and then told him why. He acknowledged his screw up due to lack of knowing and (assuming) apologized. The other side of the friend group is right, you should cut a bit of slack. Just make it clear going forward that it's serious for you and your not ok with it. If he's a real friend he'll respect that. If not, cut him off.", "You are from a tropical country, but where do you live now?  I ask because we have mosquitos in North America, but they do not carry dengue fever and/or malaria (and I think a person with your fear would know how dangerous or harmless the mosquitos are in the area you currently live in).\n\nBut bottom line?  NTA.  Your friend is an AH for playing on your fear, but educate yourself and know better if you have something to be fearful of.", "NTA\n\nPranks are the worst", "NTA! Ned knew that you were scared of mosquitoes. It doesn't matter that he didn't know why. He was actually not entitled to that information. He didn't pull a prank on you. He terrorized you. \n\nFYI: You might benefit from desensitization therapy. It helped me a lot with my snake phobia.", "To be clear, exploiting someone\u2019s phobias is absolutely not harmless. \n\nNTA.", "I bet old Ned is afraid of *something*. It would be a shame, a *shame*, I say, if you ever found out what it was-and played a  little \u201cprank\u201d on Ned. \n\nBecause a prank is \u201charmless\u201d. Ned even *said* so. NTA", "NTA. \"...seeing me scream and panic...\" Doesn't sound harmless. Generally, pranksters = AHs.", "I call bs on your friends and their \"niche fear\" comment. I am 100% with your opinion, OP: You don't need to give someone your list of phobias or the backstory of why you can't eat \\[insert food connected to traumatic event/intolerance/that gives you so much gas, etc.\\]. It is enough that you have a problem with it. \\[Minor rant\\] I wish people will stop with the f\\* pranking, already. It's not funny, it's hurtful, it feels like borderline hazing. I hope Ned and your friends learn something positive from this. NTA, OP, NTA.", "NTA it was a shitty prank", "NTA. Why do people think these \"pranks\" are anything other than bullying or at the very least being just plain mean? Are we all so desensitized that we think any negative reaction to being scared is an overreaction?", "If there is something that just thinking about makes you cry and panic you should take it upon yourself to fix that.\n\nHe is an asshole though, because you are right, he shouldn't have to understand the why of asking him to stop fucking with you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re exactly right. You shouldn\u2019t have to tell Ned why you\u2019re so afraid of mosquitoes for him to not pull a stupid prank. His mentality would\u2019ve allowed him to have found something else to torment you with if it weren\u2019t mosquitoes.", "So she has to reveal her trauma so her friend will respect the fear she was upfront about? Is that really what you're saying, that people need to give the dirty details of every phobia they have otherwise it's okay to prank them with their fear? Do you think that maybe this could backfire, such as it did here? \n\nWe should respect people when they tell us they're afraid of something instead of being a jerk about it, without demanding details. I don't need to know someone's backstory to treat them with respect, even if I think the phobia is silly. He is not owed slack, if someone says they'll only treat you kindly if you explain the trauma behind the fear, then they're not kind.", "Right?  I mean if she\u2019s in the US, she\u2019s seen/been around/been bitten by mosquitos and not even known it.  Any friend here would likely see a fear of mosquitos as being ridiculous UNLESS told of the full circumstances.", "Mosquitos in the US can still carry other diseases- in my state (Massachusetts), West Nile and EEE occur and there's seasonal surveillance and testing of mosquitos, and sometimes spraying is done.", "I knew a girl who had a phobia of cucumbers which is of course ridiculous and silly and funny, but her terror was very real, she would cry and have to leave the room when she saw one and even knowing it was absurd didn't help her it just made her feel worse, people who purposefully taunt others with the subject of their phobia are always the AH no matter whether the phobia is justified or not. Fears aren't logical, going out of your way to torment someone with theirs isn't cool.", "It doesn't matter if it's a \"niche fear\", it's a fear he knew you had. He took advantage of your fear to get a rise out of you. It isn't funny to purposefully trigger a person's phobia.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nWhen I was studying at the TAFE College (we were all adults there) there was an idiot woman in her 50s who liked to snap my braces.\n\nI was on blood-thinning medication so when I developed massive bruising all over my back and chest, she offered her lack of knowledge of my blood thinners as an excuse.\n\nIt was no excuse.\n\nNeither is your \"friend's\" lack of knowledge of your history.\n\nWhat he did is unjustifiable, cruel, immature and disrespectful.\n\nHe found your distress funny. What sort of \"friend\" does that make him really?", "NTA\n\nYou told him you were terrified of mosquitos. That should have been enough. Instead, he thought it was funny to bully and frighten you. This is NOT a friend and I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him.", "Personally, I think pranks are always a shitty thing to do. I don't care how inoccuous the prank is. Only assholes prank people. NTA.", "I can't wait until some days he says,\n\n\"Your honor, I meant to steal a counterfeit purse! She should have walked around announcing it was real so I wouldn't commit grand larceny by mistake!\"\n\nEdit: /s of course. Also NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt is literally NEVER acceptable to weaponize someone's weaknesses, triggers or phobias.\n\nNEVER. \n\n(By the way,  if you are in the US, there's a body oil called \"Skin so Soft\" made by Avon that works surprisingly well as a repellent and smells wonderful. )", "I have friends who are scared of dogs.  I would be the AH if I brought a dog to them and insisted they interact.  I don't know if there is something behind their fear, jus that they are scared of dogs.\n\nNed know you were scared of mosquitoes.  He provoked you.  He was the AH because he knew your fear.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This guys needs to grow the fuck up.", "NTA.\nFears can be rational (based on real risk or past trauma, etc.) or irrational (just plain fear/phobia), but in the end, it doesn't matter, because both types of fear are real.  Mosquitoes are your real fear and he didn't respect you and your fear, and now he's trying to deflect blame to you by making it 'your fault' for not telling him your complete medical and trauma history because if he 'knew' your  trauma then he would 'approve' of your fear. He didn't need that info and doesn't deserve that info considering how little he respects you. You don't need him to approve your fear, he needs to learn to respect people.", "Reminds me of a boy at school when I said I didn\u2019t like crane flies / daddy long legs, he got a handful of them and threw them in my face. He thought it would be funny, his friends thought it was funny, he said \u2019This will cure you\u2019. I wet myself in fear as they were all over my face and in my mouth. For 30 years I had a phobia of them, which also included moths and those tiny fruit flies that bounce off you. \nNTA - why don\u2019t people take, \u2018I don\u2019t like / I\u2019m scared of them\u2019 at face value?", "Yeah, but this guy didn\u2019t \u201ctorment\u201d the OP.  She admits that he stopped very quickly when he realized she was actually scared.  How many people say they are scared of this or that or have a \u201cphobia\u201d when it\u2019s nothing of the sort?  Probably the same number who say they have OCD when they actually just like things tidy.  I\u2019d say NAH.", "The fact he guilts her for not telling him the details of her phobia/ptsd's backstory afterwards and how he gets his friends (because c'mon that's the most likely explanation) to tell her she should apologise/guilt her afterwards pushes him FIRMLY into AH territory."]}
