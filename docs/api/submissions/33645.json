This rarely happens. The older dog may be excited about the puppy at first, but that initial excitement wears off fast. The puppy wears out the older dog, and almost invariably pushes it into an earlier grave. I've seen it time and again; the elderly dog declines quickly and unexpectedly due to stress.\n\nAnd the older dog will not train your puppy.
