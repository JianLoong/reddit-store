To give all the necessary background information, my fiance is South Asian and I am White, born and raised in America. His family is Muslim and mine is Catholic, but neither of us are religious. We are planning on having a (mostly) traditional Bengali wedding, which involves multiple events over multiple days, so we are currently planning on having the wedding next year on the weekend between Christmas and New Years. No wedding events would actually be on Christmas. The first might be on the 27th, but is probably going to be on the 28th.\n\nWe are not planning on having a Church ceremony, since it's not really important to me. Because of that, I also am not planning on wearing a white dress for any of the events, including the reception.

My grandmother decided to show me her wedding dress. Apparently my grandmother had saved her it for me to wear. I told her that I wasn't going to be wearing a wedding dress, and that I'd either be wearing a sari or a lehenga instead. She asked me if I didn't think I would look wearing \"such ethnic clothes\" (this is a direct quote) in a church. I got really upset about that, and just flat out told her that we weren't going to have a church ceremony.\n\nI guess my family all assumed we would have a church ceremony, and that I'd wear my grandmother's dress. They got really upset, but mainly my grandmother. She started talking about how I was already \"ruining Christmas\" with my wedding, so the least I could do is give them the wedding ceremony that they want and get married the \"proper\" way. She told me how my grandfather was really looking forward to walking me down the aisle since he never got to do so for my mom. I've never met my father and he is not in my life, so my grandfather assumed he'd be the one to do it. I told her that there was no way he was giving me away because of comments he had made in the past.\n\nAfter I said that, my grandmother basically said that they weren't going to pay for the wedding at all if I was going to be so ungrateful. I told her that that was fine, but that if she was going to try blackmailing me with money, she wasn't going to be invited to any of it, since the rest is to \"ethnic\" for her anyway.\n\nTL;DR: My family is upset that I don't want to wear my grandmother's wedding dress because I'm not planning on wearing any sort of white wedding dress at all.

Your family is being incredibly racist and manipulative with the whole situation. Plus you wearing a lehenga or sari would be much more meaningful to your husband and his family who seem to appreciate you much more than your own family. When I attended my cousin\u2019s wedding I was one of the few people wearing traditional clothing (he\u2019s Indian and so are some of my family, so I wore a sari) and it meant a lot to him since he didn\u2019t have family with him and was in a different country.\n\nEdit: spelling error", "NTA.

Your fiance's family sounds lovely.", "NTA, it seems she had expectations, and you didn't write that she had shared any of these expectations with you. It also seems she doesn't really know you very well because she had her own image of who you were. \n\nTimes have changed, and yes, before there was an element of doing things for your family. In centuries past, we also had a different life expectancy.\n\nIf you knew a great tailor and designer, you could take her wedding dress and redo it so it was incorporated into the events. However, I think your grandmother would freak out if a stich was cut in her dress. It could turn out amazing to take the dress and make it into a hybrid being a bridge between cultures.", "NTA. they are mad they can\u2019t bully you and that they won\u2019t get to use u as a dress up doll. you could always offer to incorporate a piece of fabric from gramas dress into your outfit. but they really need to grow up and realize that people do things differently and it\u2019s okay to not be racist", "NTA\u2026.your wedding, your choice. \n\nWould people flip their shit if you dyed the dress and wore it to one of the events?", "NTA.

Your grandmother is acting entitled and she's super racist. She can stay home, in fact it's probably better that she does. What is it about weddings that make family members feel like they have the right to dictate how the ceremony goes? It's about what the couple wants.

To most people, tradition is very important - you seem like the odd one out in your family. It's especially important for the elderly - they were born in VERY different times, and you should respect their feelings. Sure, your wedding your rules, everything should be your way, and everyone who disagrees can kindly go do something in private. But you could at least see their perspective. It doesn't seem like you even tried to do that.\n\nAlso, for practical reasons only, the week between Christmas and New Year is the worst time to organize a wedding. Not just because you're most likely to collide with all your guests' plans, but also because the Christmas-New Year time is such a staple every year it's hard to get in mood for anything else. But... it's your wedding. If you want it at the most inconvenient time, you have every right to. I'm just saying I see how that could be a little upsetting to your family.", "NTA but I highly suspect a neutral party observing the entire exchange might vote for everyone as this seems highly likely the full exchange was probably a bit heated in every direction.", "Maybe ever-so-slightly inconsiderate with the timing between Christmas and New Year, which is a bad time for people to travel but \u2026\n\nOh you mean about your racist Grandma and co.?

What colors will you go toward?\n\nI realize your grandmother is a bit borish, but I think you should consider cutting them some slack.  In America it's typical to dream about an American wedding.  It's all Americans know to dream *about*.  What they expected isn't above the norm.\n\nLet the news sink in.  Show them how beautiful these outfits are.

Nanna had her wedding day where she could have done as she pleased.  Tell her to butt out of trying to tell you what to do with YOUR day!  She doesn't get to have a choice and please don't feel obliged to please her with what you decide.  You do you and make your and fiance's day something that you both want and will remember with fondness.\n\n\"wearing a lehenga\"\n\nDo it, you are right, there are some absolutely spectacular ones out there.  When I was in Mumbai a few years ago, I saw an elaborately stunning red one in a shop window.  I'm a massive red fan and told my husband (we're both European white) that if I had have seen that before we got married, that gown is what I would have chosen for my wedding day.", "NTA\n\nWhether or not the wedding is held in a church is irrelevant the attire is somewhere between formal and cheerful either way. (Looks up what a lehenga looks like... definitely looks closer to the formal side to me.)", "I am continually flummoxed by people who believe they can dictate other people's weddings. It's YOUR wedding. Don't do ANYTHING you don't want to do, and disinvite any shit stirrers. Racist-ass grandparents can stay home. NTA.", "You are NTA.  The only confusing part for me was, was she originally paying for your wedding?  That doesn't sound like an arrangement that would work for you or her.", "NTA and your family sounds awful. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this, and I hope you have the most AMAZING wedding!", "NTA.  It's you and your fiance's wedding. It's supposed to be representative of you guys as a couple. Do what's best for you both. Anyone who doesn't like it can stay home. Definitely NTA in anyway, shape,  or form. \nPs. Congrats!", "NTA\n\nYour family sure makes a lot of assumptions about YOUR wedding! \n\nAnd I'm sorry but grandma's dress is probably nothing you'd want to wear even if you were doing a church wedding. I can't imagine how outdated that dress is two generations after the original use.", "Exactly. If these things were critically important to them, why didn't they make them happen at their weddings?\n\n>She told me how my grandfather was really looking forward to walking me down the aisle since he never got to do so for my mom.\n\nWhy are his and your mother's choices your (OP's) problem? I would think any remorse from their choices is their responsibility?", "Interestingly enough, we actually chose that time period because it would be the most convenient time for everyone involved. My entire family always comes to my grandparents' house for Christmas, and most of them stay until New Years'. That way it won't be any extra travel for most of my family. It's also a bit more convenient for my fiance's family, since they don't celebrate Christmas, so they'll be able to not have to take as many days off. If anything, it'll be inconvenient for our friends.\n\nPlus, that time is very special for us because of our anniversary.\n\nI appreciate your comment anyway!", "I think I was unclear in my post. I never asked my grandmother for money for the wedding, and I wasn't counting on it either. She just assumed that I would want her to pay for it because my family is extremely wealthy and they paid for my other cousins. I was upset that she thought she could financially blackmail me, when I'd never even asked for her money in the first place. \n\nAlso, they aren't like explicitly racist. They're just a bit close-minded and backwards. At the end of the day, they are my family, and they aren't bad people. They like my fiance and always ask to bring him around.", "I interpreted this as \u201cyou don\u2019t have to give me money at all, but if you\u2019re going to be racist I don\u2019t want your money.\u201d \n\nMy pick is NTA, OP doesn\u2019t have to invite anyone to their wedding they don\u2019t want to and doubly so for assholes who are making her day about themselves.", "Why should she cut these bigots any slack? So what if they had certain expectations? Their expectations are irrelevant because it's not their wedding! OP shouldn't have to invest any effort whatsoever in convincing these people to accept choices that are none of their business to begin with.", "Thank you so much! His mother told me the traditional colors are red, pink, and gold so I think I'm personally leaning towards pink!\n\nI understand that. I guess I've kind of always known that I was going to marry him, since we've known each other since we were little kids. His mom would show me Bollywood movies growing up, and I just sort of fell in love with the big, extravagant Desi weddings! But I know most people aren't like that.", "Kind of crappy to say that. Some dresses are more timeless than others but why throw gma's under the bus like that?", "Agreeing with the commentor below and jumping in to add that just because you're white, doesn't mean you don't have a culture to uphold.  It is 100% your decision in the end but can you understand a little bit why your family might be upset that the wedding will be only Bengali?  This isn't only about racism; you are picking your future husband's culture over yours and expecting your family to be thrilled that the only traditions they'll see will be someone else's, maybe in a language that don't understand.  This is not the way to ensure future harmony and get them interested in the culture of your future in-laws.  This is perfectly fine if that's what you want but don't be surprised at the fallout.  At the very least, don't change plans but show some empathy.", "Um... it doesn't really work that way. Your family doesn't just happen to be all at your grandparents in the last week of December. They come to your grandparents FOR CHRISTMAS. Big difference. And the fact it's a regular thing makes it even more jarring. I'm going to take some guesses here, but it looks like everyone expects to be able to spend some quality family time and wind down in relative peace and quiet after the whole year. Throwing a wedding at them would be the opposite of winding down.\n\nExtra travel really isn't a problem. Wedding (if you're a traditionalist like your grandmother) is quite literally the most important day of your life. And it's very important for the entire family, too. It's barely an inconvenience that they have to travel to participate in it. I know you meant well, but you're making wrong tradeoffs. I'm willing to bet everyone in your family would agree taking away the Christmas week is far worse than making them travel around the state/country/world one extra time.", "She's not trying to blackmail you, she's trying to bribe you. If she was trying to blackmail you, she would be threatening to release some information about you that you want kept secret. Offering to give you money if you do what she wants is an attempt to bribe you.", "So what exactly where you saying about your grandmother attending your wedding in the quoted bit?", "These people are her Family.  They are likely sheltered in a white town and a white church.  They only know American ways.  It can't hurt her to try and open that dialogue.   I think they are more ignorant and hurt because they don't understand. \n\nIf her family refuses to change THEN we can call them racists names.\n\nI think we should always try to seek peace until it becomes clear peace is impossible.  Then RUN, lock the *door*, and throw away the key.\n\nThis ladies wedding is going to be Stunning!  I'm so excited for her!", "Girl!  I'd do BOTH.  haha  Except never a catholic wedding. They are so oooo long and I don't like kneeling.  Lol\n\nI wish we were friends so I could watch this fall into place and all the beautiful things you'll have on, and around, you!  Will you do Henna?\n\nClearly, some of your family will never accept this,  but HOW you approach it will make all the difference.\n\n\"Grandma, I'm sorry you are disappointed.   Your dress is beautiful,  but it isn't something that I am going to wear because we have very different taste.\"  Suggest maybe a piece of her wedding dress be sewn into yours so it Is with you?\n\nTell them what you've grown up loving about the culture.  Maybe if you show them your heart/dreams it'll be easier?\n\nHOWEVER,  if none of that works then draw boundaries and do *you*.\n\nTruly.  Their marriage dresses are stunning!", "I was saying that I don't want someone who's going to blackmail me with money and be close-minded about my wedding to attend it.", "If she is getting married to the guy I would assume they have been dating quite a while. How much time does the family need to learn/change? \nOr is that they haven't even bothered to learn his culture at all and assumed their traditions would take precedence? Bold of them to assume so. Are proper weddings only church weddings - so beach weddings in grandma's white dress would also be unacceptable? Or is it cos it's a Bengali wedding is unacceptable?\nDid grandma question how it would look if she wore lehenga in church because it would look out of place? Or because she's looking down at it cos it's not good enough for a \"proper\" wedding? What things did grandpa say that he wouldn't have place in the wedding?\n\nHow much of it adds up before ignorance is racism?", "Okay I'd give that a NTA, though a bit rash."]}
