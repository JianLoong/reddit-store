Some background, I (40M) and my wife Kay (38F) have been married for a year and together for 3. She has been married twice before, and has twins (14F) with her first husband who she divorced and one kid (9F) from her second husband who passed away 6 years ago. I am also divorced and have a daughter (11F). Kay is also currently 5 months pregnant.\n\nNow on to the issue at hand. My wife is working on a slideshow for her youngest sister\u2019s wedding and was going through pictures for it on her laptop. Last night she fell asleep with her laptop open and even though I shouldn\u2019t have I went through her pictures.\n\nMost of it was family stuff. There were some family pictures of her and her first husband with their kids from before they were divorced but none of them as a couple or of just him. There were a lot of pictures of her second husband which is fine because I know she wanted to keep his memory alive for herself and her daughter. But then I found multiple extremely explicit videos of them together. I was super upset but instead of waking her I decided to sleep on it and talk to her about it.\n\nToday before work I asked my wife why she still had her sex tapes with her husband. She said she doesn\u2019t watch them she just has them there. I asked her if she was planning on deleting them and she said no. We got into an argument and she said it\u2019s not like she\u2019s passing them on to her kids and she has plenty of other pictures and videos of him which I don\u2019t have an issue with. It\u2019s just the sex tapes. She said that she felt like she would be deleting a memory and once those videos are gone, they\u2019re gone for good. I demanded that she delete the videos or I would leave because this feels like cheating. She called me an asshole, took her laptop to work with her and changed the passwords, and I\u2019m now at my mother\u2019s house. I asked a few people and it was pretty split about whether I was wrong or not.

To her, they are moments in time that mattered with someone she thought she'd be with for longer. Memories can fade, and maybe holding onto the videos gives her more of a grasp.\n\nAs the new husband, I can understand feeling unsettled or threatened... but it's not cheating ffs. She's not harming you by keeping the tapes. And she's not harming herself either -- they just exist.  Just like her past with her late husband will always exist.\n\nI do think YTA for going straight to threatening to leave if she didn't delete them and not having an adult conversation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Also the asshole for invading her privacy.  You wouldn't even know this if you'd kept out of her files.", "On reflection... I know this is a somewhat crazy conclusion, but NAH.\n\nExes by death are a very, very different thing to exes by separation. It's messy, it's emotional, it's irrational and above all, nothing about it is simple.\n\nOnce somebody dies, you don't want to delete any more of the little of them that still exists on planet Earth - even if it's something that you might never actually look at again. And it is, for her, most likely a link to something extremely personal and intimate that she shared with someone she loves, who is now gone. It's more than just a shag.\n\nOn the other hand, I completely get why you're upset about it. So I don't blame you either.\n\nShe will grieve him for the rest of her life, and she'll love both of you, separately, for the rest of her life - and that's ok. If I were you, I'd have the conversation about how her watching it would upset you, but leave it at that.", "He's dead.  He's not her EX-husband, he's her LATE husband.  You chose to be with a widow, that is much more complicated than a divorcee.  You also violated her trust by snooping through her laptop.  I was leaning towards N A H, but I think ultimately YTA", "YTA. It's fine to feel conflicted about something like this, but threatening to break up your marriage over it is an overreaction. She might have misgivings about deleting the mementos she has from him that have nothing to do with you. She is not going to leave you for a dead man. This isn't about you or your marriage, this is about a life she had before she met you that probably ended in an unexpected way. It's unlikely to be a threat to your marriage, but your choice to repeatedly poke at an emotional sore spot of hers could be.", "YTA.\n\nA) that's not cheating. He's dead. \nB) you were snooping.", "Ahhhhhh yes. The old \u201cCheating with the Dead Husband\u201d gambit.", "That\u2019s not cheating. That\u2019s her dead husband. Although reasonable people can have differing opinions on keeping the videos, YTA for saying it\u2019s cheating. You escalated and delivered an ultimatum as though she was having sex with a living man. She didn\u2019t. That was her husband, when they were alive together. Maybe that\u2019s why you hate it.", "YTA. It is not like cheating and you\u2019re being waaaay over dramatic here. \n\nThis is a person she loved and lost before you. They are treasured memories. There\u2019s no reason to treat them as some sort of competition for your love and affection, because they\u2019re not. But reacting like this is a great way to make sure you look like a much smaller person than the one who is gone.", "YTA. As someone who had a husband die, she just isn't ready to let go of certain memories. Its not cheating.. And while she was ready to move on to a new relationship, when we lose someone who was supposed to be there forever to death, it is a totally different situation that you can NEVER understand unless it's happened to you. You see sex... She sees memories of their love. She's not ready. And you should respect that as someone who loves her, and who she loves now.", "YTA. Her previous partner DIED, you absolute one dollar coin. It's not like she's masturbating to the videos every night, she just literally can't bring herself to erase video evidence of her LATE husband's existence.\n\nWhen someone is dead, the sum total of evidence of who they were and that they were on this earth is limited and fragile. Maybe she doesn't have any use for the sex tapes, but deleting the videos is deleting one of the limited number of things that document her husband's existence. Letting go of pieces of a lost loved one takes time. As much as it's just a sex tape, it's also a documented piece of the happiness she shared with her husband and deleting it so it no longer exists is something that is her decision alone.", "YTA - you went looking where you shouldn't, and these are videos from a time before your marriage with a person who is now dead. It's not for you to dictate whether she deletes these videos, only that they be well-concealed from children.", "NAH to ask her to delete the videos.  \n\nHowever, is not \"like cheating\" to have memories of someone you were married to before your prior spouse, and it isn't a surprise that your wife reacted poorly to that.  For heaven's sake, man, you married a woman who has been married twice before, and has three kids.  She had a life before she met you!  Presumably you had a life before you met her.  In my opinion, while you were not wrong to ask her to delete the videos, threatening to leave her and going to your mother's house was an overreaction.  \n\nI realize this is AITA and and not \"relationship advice\" but I think you should go home and never bring this up again, or at least not anytime soon.  At this point your wife is 38 and pregnant with her fourth child.  She might be feeling unattractive as compared with when she was in her 20s. You haven't explained when the videos were made, but even though she isn't watching them, maybe their existence reminds her of a memory that is important to her.  It might be nothing more than it makes her happy to have nude photos of *herself* when she was younger that she can one day look back at when she's 80 to help her remember her younger self.\n\nJust remember, she's with you now!   Best wishes for you and your family.", "YTA.\n\nYou had no business going through her stuff in the first place.\n\nKeeping videos, of any kind, where the other person is DEAD is not any form of \u201ccheating\u201d.\n\nGiving her a divorce ultimatum, over an absurd allegation of \u201ccheating\u201d due to retaining videos of a dead person, which you violated her trust to even learn the existence of, is an overreaction.  You should have started with asking for counseling or therapy.", "YTA for discussing your wife\u2019s sex tapes with the \u201cfew others\u201d you consulted.", "NAH", "YTA. What\u2019s she going to do, masturbate to a dead person? She could do that without the video. Obviously she wishes he was still alive, obviously she can\u2019t bring him back. Do you want her to throw out her old wedding ring too?", "YTA - if you want to leave a relationship, leave a relationship, if you're think about leaving, express that. But these \"do x or I'll leave you,\" ultimatums just seem stupid. \n\nIt's so needlessly dramatic.", "YTA  \nYou shouldn't have gone through her laptop.  \nFULL STOP.", "YTA- My take is that it\u2019s not a big deal, considering her previous husband has passed away. It\u2019s not the same as cheating, she isn\u2019t going back to him. The videos themselves haven\u2019t given you any information you didn\u2019t already know about her and her past relationships, except maybe made her past seem more real and harder to ignore for you. It may be slightly different if he was still alive, but as it is, they really aren\u2019t hurting you unless you let them become an issue between you.", "YTA.  I hope she does leave you.", "YTA for real\n\nFirst, it's her late husband. Like it or not, there's still live there and possibly unfinished business/lack of closure, etc. You're with her bc he is dead. \n\nSecond, whe had a life before you. She didn't step out of a box in mint condition for you to marry. It's not like she has recent videos of her and someone that's not you. It's her and her late husband. Someone she didn't choose to leave. Someone who she still had shared hopes and dreams with when he left. There is going to be a part of her that always misses and loves him. If you push against that, you will lose. She isn't going to go cheat on you with this guy. It's essentially personalized porn. \n\nThird, you snooped. You didn't discover anything that shows she betrayed you. You discovered a pain to her heart. In some ways, this is her memory box. You invaded her privacy and then got mad about it? Not just mad, but you go nuclear. Just because you are married does not mean you're not allowed privacy. This is not a discovery that has any bearing on you. This is part of what she kept instead of completely stripping her life after the loss (again you're with her not bc she and her second hubby didn't work out, but because he's dead)  of someone so important to her.\n\nProfusely apologize and stop being jealous and threatened by a ghost.", "I'm gonna say YTA mostly because you invaded her privacy and left her alone at 5 months pregnant. But I understand your complicated feelings.\n\nThe thing is, when someone dies suddenly every piece of their memory left becomes so much more valuable. A piece of paper they scribbled on is now extremely precious and you'd break down if you accidentally threw it away. So, deleting even one piece of this proof of their existence feels wrong. You sort of cling to everything you have left, even if you're not gonna look at it. I hope that helps explain why your wife would want to keep these.", "YTA\n\nYour feelings are valid, it's fine to be uncomfortable about this, but what you did in response to those feelings is not. \n\nYou don't just up and leave, throwing out ultimatums, when shit gets difficult. You've only been together three years and you have a baby baking in the oven, but you're ready to walk away already? Come on, dude! Man up! Real. Men. Don't. Just. Leave. \n\n(Except in instances of abuse, mistreatment, really bad shit. Don't come at me, Reddit, with every single nuance of times when a man should just leave! Of course there are exceptions. Y'all know what I mean when I say this.)\n\nIn your post you mentioned that you have been divorced also. Is it possible that your response to this issue is due to some baggage you're still carrying around about your own past relationship? If so, you gotta figure out how to let it go. She ain't her. \n\nTry to compromise. Why isn't anybody willing to compromise anymore? It's always all- or- nothing! Let me tell ya, I've been with the same person for over 20 years, literally since my senior year of high school, and we didn't get here without a lot of compromises along the way!\n\nYou may be thinking, how can there possibly be a compromise to this? Well, a few ideas come to mind.\n\n1. Shelve this discussion for at least a year. Maybe longer. She is pregnant, dude! She is not mistreating you, she is not cheating, she is not watching the videos, and again, she is pregnant! And though I'm sure she loves you very much, a part of her is still grieving the untimely death of 2nd husband. When you marry a widow, you do so with the understanding that you carry part of this baggage.\n\n2. Or, how about this. No laptop is ever completely secure, I don't care how many passwords and firewalls are on it. And this story is proof that she does, at least occasionally, leave it open and unlocked. One of the kids could decide to borrow it one day, notice the file labeled Photos, think \"oh cool, I wanna browse some old family photos\" and then next thing you know, Mom's on the screen orgasming with 2nd husband and Kid is traumatized! \n\nSo how about this: She transfers the videos to an external hard drive, and throws it in an old box of mementos in the back of the closet. (I can't be the only one that has one of those, right?) Maybe it would make you feel a teensy bit better about the videos if they weren't quite so accessible, to her or to anyone. And for her, she'd feel better knowing that the tangible memory of him still exists even though she doesn't want to watch them anyway. And one of the few remaining pieces of proof that her 2nd husband lived isn't gone forever. \n\n3. A combination of 1 and 2. Put the videos on an external drive, put it in a box, and a year or two down the road if you haven't completely forgotten about it anyway because you're about to have FIVE children to worry about! Two teens, two in pre-adolescence, and a baby! Y'all are gonna have MUCH bigger problems to worry about!, then revisit the discussion when it's not so new and raw for both of you, and she doesn't have pregnancy/new baby hormones surging through her body. Maybe down the road she'll be more okay with the idea of deleting them if it's still really bothering you that much then. \n\nYou gotta try to be more pragmatic about this. Yes, sex videos are very, very personal and very intimate. But he's dead. There will never be another photo, another experience, another memory, another story, because he's gone forever. It's very normal for her to not want to let go of the little pieces of him that still remain on this earth. \n\nAnd apologize for leaving. Can you even fathom how many abandonment issues she's already carrying? Divorced, widowed... damn. And pregnant too! Grovel, if you have to. Bring her her favorite flowers and chocolate, hell, ALL her favorite things!, give her a foot massage, rub her temples, freaking pamper her. She loves YOU, dude. And she's carrying your baby! Pregnancy is so freaking hard on a woman's body and mind. APOLOGIZE!!!", "YTA. You are being insecure over a memory. She\u2019s not turning the video on when you have sex or masturbating to it or even watching it, just keeping it as a personal memory. \n\nMaybe she will want to look back when she\u2019s older and see what she looked like or just remember fondly on cherished memories. \n\nYou don\u2019t own her mind or every aspect of her heart. These things don\u2019t take away from your relationship, but add to her self. \n\nIt ain\u2019t about you homie, grow up.", "YTA. Each party in a relationship has an expectation of privacy. You basically threw hers in the trash. She's not going to forget this, either. \n\nAlso, NTA. I get where you're coming from. But her ex is passed. There's no worries on her going back to him. My ex had a tattoo of her ex bf.. didn't bother me in the least.", "NAH...\n\nShe has a right to have them. You have a right not want to be with her over it. At the very least these are proof she wants to be able to have an easier time reliving those moments in her mind. I feel terrible for her but she shouldn't have married you knowing she is still hung up on those memories. It makes you a defacto Plan B. \n\nYou can't compete with a dead man and if she needs to still feel that close to him sexually, you have every right to walk away. No, it's not like she is cheating, but clearly, she isn't ready to move on. It's time for you to do it for yourself instead of always feeling like plan B.", "NTA if she wasn\u2019t ready to move on from her late husband she shouldn\u2019t have gotten MARRIED. No way if the roles were reversed this would be okay. If you haven\u2019t moved on don\u2019t get married wether the person is dead or not. It\u2019s not fair emotionally and it seems it would mean she isn\u2019t in it all the way or in it for the right reasons.", "YTA JFC you are jealous of a dead man. Seriously your wife had a life before you. Get over it. YOU decided to go through memories. HER memories. She isnt watching them so stop with the she is cheating BS.  \n\nWhy you are a AH you decided to snoop. And you didn't like what you saw becuase you are insecure. She was married and is grieving him. You need to get over it.\n\nMy husband has a sex tape of him and another female who died. GUESS WHAT I don't care. I have known about it and it doesn't bother me in any way shape or form. \nIt's in his memory box. He told me about it when he was going through it. I said it was his personal memory and I wasn't going to tell him to get rid of it. It is and will be his choice on what he does with that video.", "YTA", "NTA", "Its not like she's going to run back to him now is it.", "You are allowed to define your own boundaries. She doesn\u2019t have to like them, or agree. But defining this boundary is not an AH thing. NTA", "NTA\u2026. There is no need to keep sex tapes after a relationship is over. I guarantee if this was a woman telling the story, the comments would be all be NTA.", "I'm going with NTA. I don't think anyone should keep sex tapes of their exes, dead or alive. It's pretty disrespectful to your current relationship.  You wonder how society ever got along without smartphones for thousands of years.", "\u2026 Had to think about this one for a while, but I\u2019m going with ESH, almost NAH. In any other circumstance, her having sex tapes with an ex once you\u2019ve married is unacceptable IMO (at least if you have a problem with it). But this is a little different. She was grieving for a long time, she very likely misses him dearly even now! And that doesn\u2019t detract from the love she has from you! But on the other hand, it\u2019s been years for her. She isn\u2019t in that relationship anymore. I can\u2019t know what I\u2019d do in this situation, but I think getting remarried would mean it\u2019s time to move on. Although if I\u2019m fully honest, I\u2019m sure I would have also kept copies on my computer and forgot about them, and then not ever delete them unless confronted. So I get where she\u2019s at.  I think she just felt caught in the cold and a little embarrassed, and if all goes well, she\u2019ll say goodbye to them. Or maybe you\u2019ll come to terms with her wanting to hold on to those memories (it\u2019s not like she\u2019s gonna cheat on you with him, or like you can\u2019t make better sex tapes with the air that God keeps in your lungs), I don\u2019t know. \n\nI almost said NAH, but I changed it to ESH, because this should *never* be the cause for you two to get a divorce. What other marriage problems do you have that you resort to sleeping on a couch instead of talking this out? Kind of a bad omen for this marriage if you guys don\u2019t understand what the other may be going through *this much*. That neither of you can find the maturity to discuss this like adults or, less ideally, give it up without a fight because you love each other\u2026 Hmm. Something just ain\u2019t right.", "NTA. Maybe don't snoop around someone stuff, but if roles were reversed and it was a woman snooping, she'd get a pass and instead they'd be saying \"if you have nothing to hide\" so there's that.\n\nI understand wanting to keep a memory, but he's not obligated to ignore how uncomfortable it makes him feel just to make her feel better about it.", "NTA. That's so unnecessary and disgusting. Not to mention disrespectful. You're dodging a bullet.

People are saying Y T A probably because he's dead but I think it would be something completely different if he were alive.  \n\nI would probably also want it gone because it's a reminder that unfortunately, she's not over him, and maybe will never be over him.  That's why I'd say she's not the AH either for not wanting to delete it, and openly saying that to you.\n\nYou might have to come to grips that he was the one she really wanted and that you might be competing with his ghost.

That probably scares her and makes the importance of videos and photographs to keep the memory alive even more crucial. \n\nWhen you started dating her, you must have talked about her feelings for him.

She has been married twice before, and has twins (14F) with her first husband who she divorced and one kid (9F) from her second husband who passed away 6 years ago. I am also divorced and have a daughter (11F). Kay is also currently 5 months pregnant.\n\nNow on to the issue at hand. My wife is working on a slideshow for her youngest sister\u2019s wedding and was going through pictures for it on her laptop. Last night she fell asleep with her laptop open and even though I shouldn\u2019t have I went through her pictures.\n\nMost of it was family stuff.

We got into an argument and she said it\u2019s not like she\u2019s passing them on to her kids and she has plenty of other pictures and videos of him which I don\u2019t have an issue with. It\u2019s just the sex tapes. She said that she felt like she would be deleting a memory and once those videos are gone, they\u2019re gone for good. I demanded that she delete the videos or I would leave because this feels like cheating. She called me an asshole, took her laptop to work with her and changed the passwords, and I\u2019m now at my mother\u2019s house. I asked a few people and it was pretty split about whether I was wrong or not. So Reddit AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Women aren't property.", ">So a sex video that she apparently never watches is a violation of monogamy, according to you.\n\nActually, for me personally I wouldn't have an issue with it provided its existence wasn't kept secret, but I think that most people in a monogamous relationship would be upset if they found that their partner still had a video of them having sex with their ex in their possession.\n\n>How do you feel about someone in a relationship watching pornography in general? Is that also cheating?\n\nMy view on monogamy is that it's defined by the couple in question, but generally most people will draw the line between watching porn, and watching porn where it's your ex and you in the leading roles.", ">\u201cOrdinarily\u201d according to whom?\n\nWe surveyed 100 people, and...", "This is a bizarre take", ">But he's not alive so it feels pretty dumb to be jealous of him\n\nIt's not jealousy, it's the breaking the boundaries of monogamy by keeping a sex tape of herself with someone else.

But don't project your toxic issues on others.", "I'm not going to try to change your mind on that as it pertains to your life. For OP, there's more going on than this hypothetical you've set out here. She's pregnant with his kid and he's walked out on her because he is so upset at the thought of these videos existing. Commitment goes both ways.", "I guess I don\u2019t understand why her memories of her sex life with her late husband are somehow less valid than funny or warm memories.

Isn\u2019t that part of the goal of a normal and healthy relationship?", "Its literal sex tapes my dude. Not just photos. If you dont delete nudes and sex tapes after a relationship ends youre a weirdo. That is a fact.

My ruling will not change.", "LOL", "LOL", "Marriage license and multiple laws across the us say differently.", "I think he's allowed to feel that way, but not after snooping.\n\n I'll just say for me I doubt I could ever get turned on by a sex tape of a close partner who died, like what the hell. That tape is a repository of grief. Imo the fact that it's a sex tape is irrelevant: it's a priceless memento. Who even cares about the sex anymore you know? Just him.", ">  it's the breaking the boundaries of monogamy\n\nHow?  She was married to the man at the time.  And furthermore, she said she hasn't watched the tape and doesn't plan to. \n\nThe only person to watch the tape is OP, who must have watched it to be able to report to all of us that it is explicit.", "This is actually a very good point.   People didn't know asbestos, lead, or radiation would hurt them, yet we found out only by massive numbers of people being severely harmed, up to the point of dying.  Thalidomide, oxycontin, burning fossil fuels are other great examples.", "The problem is that at MINIMUM this is an ESH because he was snooping", "I actually kind of agree, except we don't know if OP was under the impression he was those things or not. I honestly a bit shocked by the results if this post and how many ppl are ok not being someone \"everything\" for lack of better words.", "By that logic should everyone be able to keep sex tapes of past relationships?", "He's dead, and she says she doesn't watch them, she just likes knowing that they exist.  She's not ready to delete them.   OP over-reacted.", "I would suggest that she has watched the tape \\*at some point\\*, just that she hasn't returned to it since at least starting a new relationship. \n\nAnd look, as initially stated, I think OP should come to terms with her not deleting it provided that she leaves it alone.", "Happy cake day!", "Perhaps, but I think that honestly the snooping isn't really the argument going on here. The argument is over whether she should keep the video or not.", "\"Someone's everything\"...lol! How old are you? Love can and does happen more than once in a lifetime, and that doesn't make it any less \"true love.\" And nobody should ever be someone's \"everything.\" That is seriously codependent. Couples are still two separate people with individual personalities, interests, goals, hobbies, skills, etc. If I die before my husband, I would never want him to waste the rest of his life in grief. I would want him to find love again, be happy again, not spend the rest of his life alone.", "Don't quote logic. They're basing this all off emotions.", "OP did not overreact.

It's gross.", "Okay, assume she's watched it, but not since starting a relationship with OP.  How does possession of the tape \"break the boundaries of monogamy?\"   I really don't understand your point.  \n\nBeing reminded that OP's wife had a husband before might understandably make OP feel jealous, but wife literally did nothing wrong in this instance.  It's not like she's watching it on her phone while she's next to him in bed or something.   \n\nMy judgment was NAH, when it comes to asking her to delete the video.

But when his wife didn't want to delete them, OP told his wife that having pictures of her late husband was \"like cheating,\" threatened to divorce his wife, who is currently pregnant with his child, and went to his own mother's house.  That's an over-reaction.\n\nOP's wife will likely grieve for her late husband for the rest of her life.  That doesn't take away from the new love and new family she has formed with OP.
