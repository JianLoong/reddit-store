That they won't sue shows they still favor golden brat.   And as for sister, well, if you don't help them she'll have too so her opinion is biased.   Why don't you block them and go no contact?", "NTA.  Essentially, your parents are asking you to subsidize their unequal treatment of your brother and his having stolen from them. Don't let them guilt you into that.\n\nIf others in your family feel strongly about your parents' financial status,  they should feel free to support your parents.", "NTA - doesn't sound like they treated you like family, so why should you treat them like that? Just because you now have the money, now you're worth something to them? Kudos to you for offering money for a lawyer. I'd stick with that and let them get their money from golden-boy.", "NTA\n\nThey put all their parenting eggs in the wrong basket.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt isn't your responsibility, and if they're unwilling to try and recover some of the money that's been lost, that's entirely on them.", "NTA. \n\nYou are not responsible for anyone else\u2019s behavior, including your brother\u2019s. Your brother is responsible for the money he took, not you.\n\nYou worked and earned your money. It\u2019s yours to do with as you see fit. And you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for not giving away. \n\nYou offered to help your parents\u2019 get the money back (which was very generous of you because you don\u2019t even owe them that) and they refused. That was their choice. And again, you are not responsible for their choices.\n\nNTA.", "NTA How generous of your sister to offer to help them out. Wait, she didn't? Honestly she's even more selfish than you seeing as they gave her much more than they gave you.", "NTA at all. They made their bed. Let them lie in it.", "NTA. They taught you never to rely on them, and by that they should have learned not to expect to rely on you.", "NTA, absolutely.  There's no question at all here.  They spent money on your brother and not you, then he stole money from them, and now they want you to help them because you got away from their toxic mess enough to become financially stable?  Fuck them.  Your response was totally correct, ask or sue the golden child for the money back.", "NTA. You're entitled to refuse them what they refused you. And you're especially entitled to refuse to help them *in the precise way they want you to* when you've already offered to help them try to get back some of the money he stole from them. If they still prefer to protect him than to get what they need, you have no obligation to help them do it.", "NTA - you owe them nothing, regardless what they, your brother or your sisters thing. Just because you *can* do something - doesn't mean you should or are obligated to.\n\nAnd, if you haven't already, keep mum on your financial situation. The less anyone knows about it, the better.", "Why is this such a pattern?  They are turning to you.  Your sister is piling on. Why do parents who have the golden child thing inevitably believe the other kid owes them something.\n\nMaybe they see this as giving you an opportunity to win their favor? Lol!  If they moved into your backyard house, their next step would be to invite the thief to stay because he can\u2019t manage his life.  \n\nYou can\u2019t stay far enough away from them.  May help to block them though.", "NTA - sad situation, not sure what the parents will do now, but they\u2019ve made their bed and you\u2019re not Responsible to fix it.

I spent 19 years of my life being told how im a failure and how my brother is just so much better than me in every way.\n\nThan no, you're NTA. That was super easy.\n\nNo, seriously. Parents should only expect what they put in, not interest in the bare minimum. Even than, I'm not a fan of the word \"expect\" since here in North America elder care is more of a favour than an obligation. People frequently feel obligated mind you, but the \"community\" isn't going to collectively freak out.\n\nIt doesn't matter what happened to your parents whether they were stolen from, Timmy got leukemia and needed chemo, or anything else. If they were shit parents they deserve at best shit treatment.\n\n>Dont get me wrong, i can financially afford to give them money but i refuse to.\n\nCan and should are separate quantities. You could, but you shouldn't, because that would reward shit parenting.\n\n>\"Youre the only one whos financially stable\" yeah so? I did it myself.\n\nThis I think is a major point in your favour. Some might suggest you didn't do it entirely yourself in a bid to appeal to some kind of collectivist obligation, but if the best you can say for your parents is that they didn't smother you with a pillow or throw you into the street for their own amusement than yea, you did it yourself.", "nta- ignore them and continue living your life", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What else can i do about it?\n\nTruth is i cant even come close to describing the full extent of the things that went on under their care. Even if i wanted to i couldn't due to the subs rules and it being too graphic for that sorta thing but growing up i had friends going through the same things either taking themselves out or turning to drugs\n\nI dont know why i never did but i guess i used everything going on to keep me going out of spite. Went on, worked my 9-5 while going to school, had roommates, friends, went to the military and pretended to be normal \"fake it till you make it\" lost some friends but kept going. Got my degrees, a career, a life\n\nShit, im going great if you ask me. I really dont know any other way to more on from it other than never letting it get to me, living the life i was never supposed to have. \n\nIf growing up with them taught me anything is to always have respect for myself no matter what. 2 elderly people unable to retire looks bad but get the full picture, they let it happen, they saw it and didnt stop it and they continue to protect him even though he didnt care wiping them out. \n\nIn the end, why should i let these 2 back into the life ive built for myself despite them telling me id shouldve died? Nah i have enough respect for myself to not make myself live through that crap again. \n\nIdk if i said that like i meant it to but thats my 2 cents.

I\u2019ve seen my cousins and friends brought up this way. Parents giving them everything their heart desires, literally rewarding their child\u2019s bad behaviors, and they turn out like your brother. I mean i get that parents want to give their children better than they have but they just end up raising selfish people with bad habits and no accountability. Mexican parents are notorious for expressing favoritism. They probably were raised like that and thinks it\u2019s okay but it\u2019s not and now they can reap what they sow. Especially since they still don\u2019t want to teach the golden child any consequences for their actions by not suing him.  \n\nI also understand the whole sending money to family (parents) back in Mexico as my family does this. But you are under no obligation to do so especially giving the fact that you\u2019re family treated you poorly your whole life. So keep strong and as you said don\u2019t allow your parents to manipulate you anymore. It would be best that you just go no contact with them. You don\u2019t need them in your life. You already seen and proved that you can make a much better life without them. Just think do you really want them close? You\u2019ll be stuck supporting them financially for the rest of their lives. How soon will they start asking for more money from you? So that they can take fancy trips, any sort of amenities or just to continue to support your brother. Do you really think they\u2019ll be more loving if you help them? I think it\u2019s more likely that they will still complain, say your not doing enough, while still treat you as lesser than. \n\nIf they don\u2019t want to sue your brother they should go live in the house they bought for him.
