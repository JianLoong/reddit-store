{"id": 11122, "submission_id": "11e78ev", "title": "AITA for refusing to help my neighbor and her two young children when their wipers were frozen?", "selftext": "I (59M) live in a major city in Ontario, Canada. I live in a small subdivision and have 5 neighbors total on my street.\n\nFor the past few years during the winter when we're getting a lot of snow or a bad storms, as I'm leaving for my overnight shift at around 8-9pm I'll put my wifes windshield wipers up on her car and do a quick walk around to my other 5 neighbors and put their windshield wipers up on their cars (obviously not if they're outside or something, but if it looks like they're in for the night). Many of them forget to do this, as many of them have children and it typically slips their mind, and their wipers will be frozen to their car in the morning. \n\nIt's just something nice I like to do to look out for my neighbors. They're all always grateful of this and thank me for it. Many of them started doing it too and there will be nights where I'll forget to put mind and my wifes up, and in the morning one of the neighbors has done it for us.\n\nAnyway recently one of our neighbor's moved and a new family moved in as of last week. It's a young couple and their two young children. The other night I was leaving for my overnight shift at around 9pm. It was snowing really heavy and we were supposed to be getting almost 30cm of snow and it was FREEZING out. So I put my wifes wipers up and do my usual quick walk around to the other neighbors.\n\nI was hesitant when I reached my new neighbors house, as I've only introduced myself once, but did it anyway. As I was putting the second wiper up on their pick up truck the husband came charging out of his front door yelling \"HEY WHAT THE F\\*CK ARE YOU DOING TO MY TRUCK?\" I tried to explain to him I was just putting his wipers up to help him. He continued to scream at me to \"get the hell off my property and don't touch my shit AGAIN!\". The wife then came out and started yelling at me too. I apologized and started walking away. Some of my other neighbors heard the commotion and came outside to see what was happening. \n\nThey tried explaining to him too that it's just something we do, both of them wasn't having it.\n\nFast forward to this morning, I'm arriving home from my overnight shift and as I'm walking in I see the wife of this couple struggling outside to break the ice off the windshield wipers of the truck. Guess she was trying to take her kids to school and the wipers were frozen solid on the car.\n\nShe sees me and yells over \"Hey there! Do you mind giving me a hand please?\" I look over to her and yell back \"No sorry, thought I was to never touch your shit again ma'am\" and walked back inside. She yelled back at me \"wow AH!\".\n\nTold my wife about this, she thinks I should've helped her because she was just trying to get her kids to school. I disagree as I was just following what they told me.

The no-new-friends vibe we all seem to have can really backfire!", "YTA and well played \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. You knew what you were doing when you said no. They rejected your very kind neighborly help very rudely. I'm mean really, golden rule people.", "Help them again? Why? So they can berate you again? No thank you.\n\nIt would be different, possibly, if they had listened when you tried explaining, or if they had apologized before this incident. They didn't tho, and you are in no way obligated to help. Hell, if you do, they'd likely find some way to yell at you about that too. **NTA.**", "NTA. \n\nWow, so much for the stereotypical ultra nice Canadians.   \n\nOP, don\u2019t let your wife guilt you. Those people are a liability to help given how they reacted to your very kind gesture before. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t spit on them if they were on fire .", "I had a neighbor who was originally from the deep south, they had no idea about the wiper thing and came out one day in a panic thinking cars were being vandalized.\n\nI explained what was going on and you could see the wheels turning.  She just had no idea that was a thing, but appreciated the new info and started putting her wipers up as well.\n\nSo, NTA.", "NTA. You tried to help them avoid the situation and even when they understood you were trying to help they double downed on being rude. In the morning she asked for help and you declined to do so. That doesn't make you the asshole.", "NTA for refusing to help. I understand why the neighbors might have had the initial \"wtf get away from my truck\" reaction, but that's only excusable for like 30 seconds. Once you explained that you were trying to help (and they saw that literally every other car had the wipers up), they should have AT MINIMUM apologized for yelling at you, even if they didn't want to accept your help.\n\nIt's good to refuse help to people who rejected your help, especially for the exact problem you tried to help them with. They'll either solve the problem themselves or learn not to shout so much before getting the facts.", "NTA. You already tried and they said not to ever do it again. Whoops.", "NTA. Actions have consequences.", "NTA, I can see initially them being a bit angry, they didn't know what you were doing. But then you and other neighbors explained the situation. At that point they continued to be aggressive, it's not worth it to engage with them at all. \n\nBut the best part is they didn't even bother to move the wipers, even having a whole argument about it.", "Nope no way no how NTA. And LOL! It would have been so hard for me to not just crack up hysterically in her face!\n\nThey dont get to be completely rude and unreasonable to you over something so trivial and then expect you to help them out after. Let her learn her lesson the hard way!", "NTA but this was quite petty. This may have been a good opportunity to apologise for touching their cars without permission and explaining the situation where neighbours will put each others wipers up, and getting them involved in your community a bit more. I'm sure the payback was satisfying (and not entirely undeserved), but they're going to consider you an AH from now on, which is a shame.", "NTA. She has a perfectly asshole husband that can take care of it", "NTA. I could understand the initial shock of seeing an almost stranger out at night touching my vehicle, but after you explained and they were still AHs then at that point they've made their bed, you just let them lie in it. For what it's worth I share a driveway with my neighbour and every snowfall it's practically a race for us to get out there and shovel the whole thing first, just a Canadian thing I guess, shame your neighbours can't read the room (street?).", "NTA. \nThey might have been confused at first since they just moved in but they overreacted once you and other neighbours explained. \n\nThey told you not to touch their stuff, so you won\u2019t\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fit\u2019s their fault for being assholes the first time", "NTA\n\nProbably would have made sense to introduce yourself before helping with their car to avoid a misunderstanding. But after they reacted by screaming at you despite multiple neighbors telling them what was happening , it's fair to want to keep your distance.", "NTA\n\nI get if they aren't aware you do this, it's alarming to see someone fiddling with your car. However, they didn't listen to you or your neighbors explaining and doubled down. This is on them. What you do is to prevent this and not have to fiddle with ice in the morning", "NTA. I can respect that they were maybe thrown off by you initially trying to put their wipers up, but there was no reason for either them to come at you so aggressively. Her lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your part. If she's been around snow and lived in Canada for any amount of time, I'd guess she is familiar with what the weather is like and should have planned accordingly.", "Ok so the answer seems overwhelmingly that you\u2019re NTA, however I would like to play devils advocate. Perhaps this was an opportunity for the air to have been cleared after the previous misunderstanding. They shouldn\u2019t have freaked out but that\u2019s no reason to continue the animosity? \nSo perhaps you were the arsehole, only somewhat justifiably?", "NTA Karma", "Nope. NTA.", "Nta. Malicious compliance maybe", "NTA, where\u2019s her husband now to help? I\u2019m so over people moving onto these kinds of streets and not wanting to be neighborly.", "NTA- they were incredibly rude and hateful about it when you were trying to help them. I understand being surprised and shocked, but they swore at you. Yep. You're just doing what they told you!", "NTA", "NTA. I can imagine their initial confusion, but when YOU tried to explain and the NEIGHBORS tried to explain and they\u2019re still being hostile? They\u2019re on their own. I\u2019m so sorry about your grumpy neighbors. Maybe they had really horrible neighbors before and will take a while to understand selfless kindness? Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "It\u2019s rare to have a payback happen so quickly. If she wanted help, she (and her husband) should apologize before asking. They need to learn a lesson about being rude and unneighborly. It sounds like they are from Boston.", "YTA\n\nI mean, yeah, you were the asshole for just assuming that your 'good intentions' give you license to trespass and interfere with other people's property.\n\nIt's fine that you don't want to give them a hand, but don't go around pretending that they were some how out of line for not wanting their shit messed with to begin with.", "Side note- sounds like ur living in America not Canada. Geeze. Lol", "Nta \n\n You got yelled at before trying to help. ( Which I don't understand the wipers up thing if they fall they're going to bust the windshield. It's happened multiple times in my area to A couple of my neighbors and my cousins)\n\nHer calling you an asshole after you've already said no you just reinforces the fact I'm not going to help her", "NTA, you tried to be nice but they cussed you. Had they told you to just not touch thair car that wouls be different, but they made sure to yell and cuss and make a scene. They shouldn't expect any neighborhood interactions lol", "NTA-the fact that she can cuss you out the night before and then turn around and expect you to help when you already tried is baffling. INFO: where did they move from?", "Nta wow. No good deed goes unpunished.", "And then everyone clapped right?", "NTA. You should have recommended they use warm water to their windshield wipers.", "NTA You already tried to be nice and neighborly and they decided it was ok to respond to that by being an ah. Now they can enjoy the consequences of their own behavior", "NTA - Perfectly appropriate use of malicious compliance.", "NTA. They said to leave their shit alone and you did exactly as told.", "NTA - never help them, you can be injured o sued by them if something breaks.", "NTA, but you should have asked to clean the windshield wipers if you don\u2019t know the person", "NTA. \n\nActions have consequences.", "NTA\n\nI understand if they just saw a random person touching their vehicle and freaking out. But once you explained and the neighbours also explained to clear up misunderstanding, they really should have apologized. They got what they deserved with frozen wipers in the morning.", "NTA. Look you tried to be kind to a new neighbor and they bit your head off. It\u2019s pretty common to put your wipers up if there\u2019s going to be a lot of snow or freezing rain to avoid the frozen wipers on the windshield. That is something everyone in cold climates learns at one point. It\u2019s too bad your neighbor was an jerk to you for trying to be kind. Hopefully, your neighbor learned a lesson and now you both can exist without bothering each other too much.", "NTA but yeah dude you\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get shot. If I looked out my window and saw some random guy I didn\u2019t know cranking my windshield wipers back I would have a problem with that too.\n\nAnd also, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my car or if it\u2019s the design of the Volvo S 60, but on my car I can\u2019t do that with the driver side because the hood is too close and the few times I\u2019ve tried it I chipped paint off the edge of the hood, of course I\u2019m the only one that can see it from the driver seat, but it bothers me. But at least I\u2019m the one that did it to my car so I can\u2019t be mad about it.", "NTA. Let your story be a cautionary tale about how to talk to a neighbour.", "You are not obligated to help anyone..", "NTA - I love r/instantkarma", "NTA", "NTA. They freaked out when you tried to help. They can deal with that on their own.", "NTA.\n\nNo one is entitled to your help, especially when she\u2018s treated you like garbage before. Don\u2018t bite the hand that feeds you, so to say.", "Ahahahahahahahaha! Delicious and delightful!! Absolutely NTA and hey, you were just following their orders.", "NTA. Absolutely you are NTA. You tried rationally explain what you were doing, so did your neighbors, they cussed you out and told you to get off the property. They also told you not to touch their property. After that she has the nerve to ask you for help? No your wife is wrong. This was not your problem to deal with this was a consequence of their own behavior.", "NTA fellow Ontarian! My parents live in Mississauga and they do this for their neighbours (and vice-versa). The neighbours also help with the shoveling which I am 100% grateful for since the parents are a little older and it\u2019s hard for me to get to their place to shovel. I bring baked treats every so often as a thank you and it\u2019s all very lovely.\n\nThose people suck and they can lump it.", "NTA - but now that you guys have \u2018broken the ice\u2019 it\u2019s a great opportunity to be the good neighbor, introduce yourself and tell them that helping out neighbors is the dynamic of the street you live on.  It\u2019s not necessarily too late to establish exactly what everyone\u2019s boundaries are.  Man, I\u2019ve apologized so many times because I didn\u2019t understand what someone else was trying to do.  Give them an opportunity to do the right thing.  If it doesn\u2019t work out then you know exactly where that boundary is.", "NTA. I\u2019d have done the same thing. The nerve.", "NTA \n\nMaybe if they tried to apologize but until then you really don\u2019t need that mess of drama. \n\nSide note- sounds like ur living in America not Canada. Geeze. Lol", "NTA. Bad karma's a bitch. She just found out what happens when you bite a helpful hand.", "NTA - Their reaction was extreme, but not everyone is used to living in a neighborhood where people help each other out this way. They may also be new to living in a climate where putting up the wipers is necessary. They are new to the area, it was dark, the weather was bad, they have kids in the house - I can *kind of* understand them being upset to find a stranger on their property touching their vehicle late at night. I can even see how the rest of your neighbors coming over to argue with them in your defense may not have helped in that moment.  \n\nThat being said, she should have been able to put 2 and 2 together the next morning when her windshield wipers were frozen to the windshield and everyone else's were up. She had a lot of nerve to ask for your help without first apologizing for her reaction the night before (or at least saying something to clear the air).", "NTA. She and her husband both continued to scream at you even after you (and the other neighbors!) explained what you were doing for them. They should apologize for their behavior, otherwise their \"don't touch our shit\" demand should be followed.", "NTA\n\nPeople play the jack ass game, they can then be expected to be treated like one.", "NTA, these people are entitled pieces of s&#$, please dont engage with this people and never help them. Your wife is too much of a people pleaser.", "NTA. I get them questioning you for being around their vehicles but their reaction was over the top.

Keep doing you and don't touch their property.", "NTA, it is not your obligation to help anyone, though it would be a nice gesture, but when someone is being openly hostile towards you when trying to help them, fuck them, all and all help is out the window", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to ever touch anything of theirs. Odds are a new set of wipers would suddenly be **your** responsibility as they tore from being scraped off the frozen windshield.\n\nSome folks are just better left alone.
