I live in a small subdivision and have 5 neighbors total on my street.\n\nFor the past few years during the winter when we're getting a lot of snow or a bad storms, as I'm leaving for my overnight shift at around 8-9pm I'll put my wifes windshield wipers up on her car and do a quick walk around to my other 5 neighbors and put their windshield wipers up on their cars (obviously not if they're outside or something, but if it looks like they're in for the night). Many of them forget to do this, as many of them have children and it typically slips their mind, and their wipers will be frozen to their car in the morning. \n\nIt's just something nice I like to do to look out for my neighbors. They're all always grateful of this and thank me for it. Many of them started doing it too and there will be nights where I'll forget to put mind and my wifes up, and in the morning one of the neighbors has done it for us.\n\nAnyway recently one of our neighbor's moved and a new family moved in as of last week. It's a young couple and their two young children. The other night I was leaving for my overnight shift at around 9pm. It was snowing really heavy and we were supposed to be getting almost 30cm of snow and it was FREEZING out. So I put my wifes wipers up and do my usual quick walk around to the other neighbors.\n\nI was hesitant when I reached my new neighbors house, as I've only introduced myself once, but did it anyway. As I was putting the second wiper up on their pick up truck the husband came charging out of his front door yelling \"HEY WHAT THE F\\*CK ARE YOU DOING TO MY TRUCK?\" I tried to explain to him I was just putting his wipers up to help him. He continued to scream at me to \"get the hell off my property and don't touch my shit AGAIN!\". The wife then came out and started yelling at me too. I apologized and started walking away. Some of my other neighbors heard the commotion and came outside to see what was happening. \n\nThey tried explaining to him too that it's just something we do, both of them wasn't having it.\n\nFast forward to this morning, I'm arriving home from my overnight shift and as I'm walking in I see the wife of this couple struggling outside to break the ice off the windshield wipers of the truck. Guess she was trying to take her kids to school and the wipers were frozen solid on the car.\n\nShe sees me and yells over \"Hey there! Do you mind giving me a hand please?\" I look over to her and yell back \"No sorry, thought I was to never touch your shit again ma'am\" and walked back inside. She yelled back at me \"wow AH!\".\n\nTold my wife about this, she thinks I should've helped her because she was just trying to get her kids to school. I disagree as I was just following what they told me.

No thank you.\n\nIt would be different, possibly, if they had listened when you tried explaining, or if they had apologized before this incident.

I understand why the neighbors might have had the initial \"wtf get away from my truck\" reaction, but that's only excusable for like 30 seconds. Once you explained that you were trying to help (and they saw that literally every other car had the wipers up), they should have AT MINIMUM apologized for yelling at you, even if they didn't want to accept your help.\n\nIt's good to refuse help to people who rejected your help, especially for the exact problem you tried to help them with.

And LOL! It would have been so hard for me to not just crack up hysterically in her face!\n\nThey dont get to be completely rude and unreasonable to you over something so trivial and then expect you to help them out after. Let her learn her lesson the hard way!", "NTA but this was quite petty. This may have been a good opportunity to apologise for touching their cars without permission and explaining the situation where neighbours will put each others wipers up, and getting them involved in your community a bit more. I'm sure the payback was satisfying (and not entirely undeserved), but they're going to consider you an AH from now on, which is a shame.", "NTA. She has a perfectly asshole husband that can take care of it", "NTA. I could understand the initial shock of seeing an almost stranger out at night touching my vehicle, but after you explained and they were still AHs then at that point they've made their bed, you just let them lie in it.

However, they didn't listen to you or your neighbors explaining and doubled down. This is on them. What you do is to prevent this and not have to fiddle with ice in the morning", "NTA. I can respect that they were maybe thrown off by you initially trying to put their wipers up, but there was no reason for either them to come at you so aggressively.

If she's been around snow and lived in Canada for any amount of time, I'd guess she is familiar with what the weather is like and should have planned accordingly.", "Ok so the answer seems overwhelmingly that you\u2019re NTA, however I would like to play devils advocate.

I can imagine their initial confusion, but when YOU tried to explain and the NEIGHBORS tried to explain and they\u2019re still being hostile? They\u2019re on their own.

Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "It\u2019s rare to have a payback happen so quickly. If she wanted help, she (and her husband) should apologize before asking. They need to learn a lesson about being rude and unneighborly. It sounds like they are from Boston.", "YTA\n\nI mean, yeah, you were the asshole for just assuming that your 'good intentions' give you license to trespass and interfere with other people's property.\n\nIt's fine that you don't want to give them a hand, but don't go around pretending that they were some how out of line for not wanting their shit messed with to begin with.", "Side note- sounds like ur living in America not Canada. Geeze. Lol", "Nta \n\n You got yelled at before trying to help. ( Which I don't understand the wipers up thing if they fall they're going to bust the windshield.

They shouldn't expect any neighborhood interactions lol", "NTA-the fact that she can cuss you out the night before and then turn around and expect you to help when you already tried is baffling.

You should have recommended they use warm water to their windshield wipers.", "NTA You already tried to be nice and neighborly and they decided it was ok to respond to that by being an ah.

But once you explained and the neighbours also explained to clear up misunderstanding, they really should have apologized. They got what they deserved with frozen wipers in the morning.", "NTA. Look you tried to be kind to a new neighbor and they bit your head off. It\u2019s pretty common to put your wipers up if there\u2019s going to be a lot of snow or freezing rain to avoid the frozen wipers on the windshield. That is something everyone in cold climates learns at one point. It\u2019s too bad your neighbor was an jerk to you for trying to be kind. Hopefully, your neighbor learned a lesson and now you both can exist without bothering each other too much.", "NTA but yeah dude you\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get shot. If I looked out my window and saw some random guy I didn\u2019t know cranking my windshield wipers back I would have a problem with that too.\n\nAnd also, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my car or if it\u2019s the design of the Volvo S 60, but on my car I can\u2019t do that with the driver side because the hood is too close and the few times I\u2019ve tried it I chipped paint off the edge of the hood, of course I\u2019m the only one that can see it from the driver seat, but it bothers me.

My parents live in Mississauga and they do this for their neighbours (and vice-versa). The neighbours also help with the shoveling which I am 100% grateful for since the parents are a little older and it\u2019s hard for me to get to their place to shovel.

Man, I\u2019ve apologized so many times because I didn\u2019t understand what someone else was trying to do.  Give them an opportunity to do the right thing.

Bad karma's a bitch. She just found out what happens when you bite a helpful hand.", "NTA - Their reaction was extreme, but not everyone is used to living in a neighborhood where people help each other out this way. They may also be new to living in a climate where putting up the wipers is necessary. They are new to the area, it was dark, the weather was bad, they have kids in the house - I can *kind of* understand them being upset to find a stranger on their property touching their vehicle late at night. I can even see how the rest of your neighbors coming over to argue with them in your defense may not have helped in that moment.  \n\nThat being said, she should have been able to put 2 and 2 together the next morning when her windshield wipers were frozen to the windshield and everyone else's were up.

Honestly I wouldn't touch anybody's car like that unless you knew them pretty well so your first instinct on that was correct.

They didn't even open the door and asked me to leave their property. I was upset, I just wanted to do a good deed.

We had a rather pricey motorhome parked up outside for a few years and it was easy to tell the ones who jumped out their skin but actually meant it when they said they were just looking as it was very interesting and the ones who were scoping out the security.  Once they think you have seen their face they are not coming back and then you leave the extra security lights on or and indoor light on a few nights too. I\u2019ve never had to deal with it by shouting and cursing and then the few times we did end up with people who honestly wanted to do something nice or had questions it was easy to continue conversation.

Despite what some feel-good movies promote, nasty people don't change their ways, they get more entitled.", "I agree with this. It sucks and OP definiteness is NTA, but I agree sometimes it's better to just be the bigger person for the sake of longterm peace.", "Nothing wrong with being petty as fuck to a person deserving of it.", "She knew. She yelled too", "OP says that she came out and yelled too in the post.", "In the op he says that she had come out and joined her husband in screaming at him.", "She came out and yelled at him, too.", "He says that she came out and yelled at him too, so I think she knows", "Not sure why you're being down voted. It's all over the news and trucks are some of the most likely to be stolen. A virtual stranger sulking around your car at night is going to elicit a response.", "Thank god you were here to really show them how much they wasted your time by commenting!", "If she had offered an apology then maybe. She doesn\u2019t get to be a bi*** and sweep that under the rug just because she\u2019s in a tough spot. \u201cHey, you were right about the wipers, sorry we freaked out, could you please help me?\u201d \n\nHe is doing exactly as they said, not touching their truck, he\u2019s in no way the ahole.", "No. That would only be good if you assumed they were 'normal' people.\n\nBut their initial response, and their 2nd response, both made it clear they're the kind of people you want NOTHING to do with. They're the kind of people that will back into your car accidentally then lie and say you were the one to hit them. They're the kind of people that will ask for favors, and if you ever deny even 1 small favor, they will turn on you. They're bound to get you in trouble sooner or later.\n\nOf course, I can't gurantee that. But it seems like a likely enough possibility to justify keeping your distance. Not necessarily escalate, or get petty revenge, just be polite and avoid any thing more than a 'hello' or 'good morning'.", "I would just advise caution. While it may just be they were upset without thinking it could also be they are easily angered and engaging with them could cause more problems than it\u2019s worth.\n\nI know Canada is not the US but if anyone screamed at me like that and then the next day asked for help WITHOUT apologizing for the night before? Yeah I\u2019d say no thanks too. Something goes wrong and I had helped them could open the door for them to start harassing me.", "I mean, I think they were probably correct to freak out initially as strangers touching your car in 99.9% of scenarios is vandalism or theft related. The lack of change in demeanor after the explanation by the OP and other neighbors is what makes them the asshole.", "Had the ruse neighbors made any efforts to apologize or even try to get along with OP, who's been living there much longer than the newbs, your point would be valid.\n\nBut none of that happened, ot at least, hasn't been mentioned, which  just goes on to show that the newbs have no interest in being neighborly and shouldn't expect anyone to go out of the way to extend olve branches to them.", "Lol so that what? He could try to help her crack the wipers off, accidentally break one or something, and then have the couple trying to sue him for breaking their car? Nah. So that he could offer them kindness after they were so blatantly rude to him? They told him to never touch their shit again, so he\u2019s never touching their shit. He answered politely rather than screaming obscenities like they did. You suck here for making this comment \ud83e\udd23", "why should he want to start over?", "You sure you put the right judgment your comment suggested it should be NTA but you said they are the ass", "I\u2019m confused by your verdict and your comment? They seem contradictory", "It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for them to not want their stuff touched. But they don\u2019t get to yell at a person and then ask for their help later about same issue.\n\nThere\u2019s also a way to talk to people. Like questioning what he\u2019s doing first instead of just screaming.\n\nAlso, as someone who lives where it snows. It\u2019s their responsibility to pay attention to the weather and leave earlier next day. Cause they should know it takes time to clean off cars.", "This is a common thing in Canada. I live on the other side of the country from OP and I do this all the time. My parents and my grandparents all did it too.", "Look, I get no wanting your stuff to be touched. But what gives anyone the right to yell and speak to someone, especially after they explained their good intentions?! They were completely out of line for their reaction and no one deserves to be spoken to like that. So why should OP help them if they react in that way to a misunderstanding?", "No they\u2019re out of line for acting like that and then asking for help after. It\u2019s not the initial action it\u2019s the second one that makes them a clear cut AH. The op is NTA.", "Yeah I usually check that my mechanic has a PhD in wiper technology before letting them touch my vehicle, you have to be really careful and it\u2019s really complicated stuff", "They FAFO, but obviously didn't learn a danged thing from it.  \nNTA, OP. I'm petty enough I would have stood on the front step and enjoyed my coffee while watching her struggle.", "I wouldn't help in this situation, either. After that freak out, I'd be afraid of them trying to sue me if the windshield got chipped from the ice removal, or a broken wiper blade or anything. They've shown themselves to be angry and entitled.", "This is a great example of r/MaliciousCompliance", "Oh, absolutely - as far as OP's concerned, the neighbors are invisible and silent, and their property is made of lava. Avoid, ignore, do not interact. The neighbors might become visible again if they fix their behavior, but let's just say I find that pretty unlikely.", "And didn't put their vipers off after OP and neighbors told them, face palm\n\nRude and not exactly brilliant", "They\u2019re from Montreal and haven\u2019t learned to deal with ice???? Lol NTA", "NTA\n\nYou already tried to help them and they mistreated you\n\nNext day she needs help and she asks in a  rude and demanding tone without apologizing first, nah \n\nAlso, after everyone and you explained about the vipers, why didn't they put them up? They know about the snow \u2744\ufe0f\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f ffs", "Well that explains a lot lol", "NTA\n\nWhen someone treats you like garbage repeatedly, make sure to have as little contact as possible from then on out. If you get too friendly, they'll be snapping at you for some other random thing after using you.", "But I thought that all Canadians are supposed to be nice\u2026 ? :)", "Well, that explains it.", "Of course they did \ud83d\ude02 NTA", "Lol typical Montreal!", "Yep! We also help with cleaning off others cars and driveways/sidewalks after a big snowstorm.", "F*ck around and find out.", "It\u2019s such snobby behavior and I don\u2019t get why people can\u2019t be nice even if they want to mostly keep to themselves! We moved in to our home two years ago and have met most of the neighbors on this cul-de-sac and even befriended the mail man. Our dogs getting loose helped with it but honestly the place was a dump before we moved in so befriending people was easier as they were happy the house was getting a facelift. We don\u2019t hang out or anything but still meeting each other and being friendly means if we need help (or when we have needed help) our neighbors are looking out for us and we are happy to help them when needed.", "Oh, I'd tell her to piss off, too. I'm just saying, no matter her anger the night before, she called OP an AH because she's embarrassed by her behavior/husband's behavior and its direct consequences. She now realizes what AHs they were being, but like many people, it's easier for her to continue her anger towards OP than to just communicate and apologize like a sane, emotionally developed adult.", "Yes. My specific issue with this is the neighbor is feigning incompetence on an easy task. I admit that I can't change a tire and might ask a neighbor for help if I needed my battery jumped. This is frozen wipers though. Crank the heat, the defroster, and...wait. Start chipping away at the problem. Time will solve the problem. If the kids are going to be late for school, you didn't start early enough, but that's not a big enough reason to inconvenience your neighbor. Even those of us with car incompetence can manage this issue independently. \n\nNTA. \n\nNot gonna lie...I would have chuckled at the irony.", "a) it's an expression, not literal. Do you really think spit is going to put out a fire?\n\nb) It's not about 'revenge' or 'haha, see where your attitude got you', and more of a 'i know you're going to make me regret it if i try to help you, so as much as it hurts me to walk away, i'm going to walk away'. If that's their reaction to touching their wipers, then imagine what their response would be if you doused them with a bucket of rain water.", "I would. In fact I would go grab a cold drink, come back n sprawl out in a lawn chair to watch it. But by chance, do you know what a figure of speech is?", "Yes. I hate people. They dug their grave, now they can lay in it.", "You took that a bit too literally...", "Please don\u2019t tell people to do this. It could shatter their windshield from the sudden change in temperature.", "Right. Grew up in South Dakota. Would never lift wipers in an exposed area. People don\u2019t believe it snows sideways.", "What?\n\nThis is normal anywhere with ice and snow.\n\nRun the car with the heat blasting while you clear off the snow.  It's loosens up the ice so that the car can actually be safely operated.\n\nAny ice you don't get off will fly off on the highway and potentially kill someone.  Running the car helps get that ice off.\n\nNo cop is going to ticket you for idling your car to remove hazardous ice and snow. I don't know where you live that they would actually do that. \n\nRunning the car to melt ice off is such a drop in the bucket in terms of pollution and such a big gain for safety that it's not something we should be dissuading people from doing.", "Okay, but it's also illegal to drive when you can't see out the windshield or have the car covered in snow.  Sometimes you need the defrost to help loosen the ice to clear it.  I can't even get my car into gear when it's below -20C unless I let it warm up for a few minutes. The engine does not run at low rpm when it first starts in very cold weather. Do you live in an extreme climate?", "It's not the blade.. it's the wiper arm when it slams down", "So does the US lol.", "Omg. \ud83d\ude05", "I think OP overstepped the mark by touching the neighbours car without permission, whether they were doing something nice or not is beside the point, the neighbours will likely feel that OP owes them an apology. I know OP apologised at the time but I still think reiterating that he's sorry is the best first step for bringing the neighbour into the community and defusing any tension, even if he doesn't feel sorry.", "This! I bet the person writing this would have never did what they suggested.", "Until you ask, you never truly know why someone behaves the way the do. Yeah, maybe if OP responded with kindness the next morning, the wife would've shown to be mean and entitled anyway.\n\nOr maybe she would've came to the realization that OP only ever wanted to help and that she should apologize.\n\nBut now, there's almost no chance OP, or even his neighbors, will make amends with the new couple, and vice versa. And THAT'S how enemies are made.\n\nWhy are you and your kind so eager to make enemies that live on your block?", "well it's nice to know who the crazy neighbors are from the get go, and I should finish my coffee before commenting.", "More useful way to spend  time that the 400 people who commented \"oh wow, you're great\"\n\nI got one you may find really thrilling: Today a dog shit on my shoe and I told the dog owner \"please don't let you dog do that anymore\". AITA?", "Nah, lmao. They didn't just yell at OP once to get away from their car. They continued to do so even after OP and neighbors tried to explain. These people clearly aren't the kind who would be willing to learn from their mistakes or a misunderstanding. If they had calmed down after OP and neighbors tried to explain what they were doing, OP should have apologized for not asking beforehand (assuming OP didn't already do that). But these people should just be avoided since they clearly don't want the responsibility of maintaining positive interactions with their neighbors.", "Very unlikely that they would sue him over something like that. This is Canada. We only sue if there are severe damages and insurance would handle it. Broken windshield wipers? We would just go to Canadian Tire and buy a new pair for like $20", "I understand that being the bigger person and looking at the long game is lost on some people. I won\u2019t hold that against you.", "Because the stress of having drama between neighbors fucking sucks and if it can be avoided/corrected, it\u2019s good for everyone.", "Yes, I know how it reads. He acted like an ass and I'm proud of him for it.", "> There\u2019s also a way to talk to people. Like questioning what he\u2019s doing first instead of just screaming.\n\nOr like saying 'hey, I put my neighbour's wipers up when I get home late and it looks like the weather is turning to shit; want me to put yours up?", "Look I'm not saying it's good design (mostly German cars do this) but if you scratch my paint I'm going to be fucking pissed. Don't touch other people's shit without their permission. It's really not complicated.", "We certainly haven't heard that joke enough.", "As a Canadian I can confirm that we're generally polite, but don't mistake manners for kindness.", "Most are. All the anger gets transferred to the geese", "Well I haven\u2019t lived in Canada for 7 hrs but when I was young, the Quebecois were often viewed as kind of annoying by the rest of the country. Bit of a culture clash akin to the rivalry between Britain and France.", "Plus, OP says they moved from Montreal. She knows damn well how to clear ice from her windshield.", "That...was the point.", "In Germany you get a fine of 80 \u20ac.\n\nOf course you need to scrape off the ice.\n\n\"A drop in the bucket\" is the scapegoat argument to not even start trying to be better.", "Well, of course you may only start driving when your sight is clear.\nYou have to scrape it off of every window. But that doesn't invalidate my statement.\n\nIn Germany the fine for unnecessarily running the motor idle is 80 \u20ac.\n\nPlus it's really *really* [bad for the motor](https://www.adac.de/verkehr/verkehrssicherheit/wetter/motor-warmlaufen-lassen/). In short: at -10 \u00b0 C (14 \u00b0 F), after 4 minutes of running the motor idle the oil temperature has only increased to -7 \u00b0 C (19 \u00b0 F), and this means a lot of friction and wear and tear ... and lots of emissions on top of that.\n\nIt's definitely better to clean the windows and then get the motor running at some medium rpm to warm it up most efficiently while driving. If you have cold winters a parking heater is the way to go. Most Diesel cars already have a secondary heating. For my car the parking heater was a cheap option at approx. 500 \u20ac.\n\nI have experienced cold winters with -25 \u00b0 C (-13 \u00b0 F) and it worked for me. At -28 \u00b0 C (-18 \u00b0 F) I had problems with the Diesel turning to jelly but that's another discussion.", "oh so like a justified AH?", "Aw, I\u2019m sorry. Low hanging fruit that I couldn\u2019t resist. :)", "Hah! \ud83d\ude02", "As an Ontarian, Quebecois can be a little ruder/blunter than other Canadians. When I was in Montreal last year, everyone was lovely, but Quebecois living in Ontario seem to be completely different people.", "Yes"]}
