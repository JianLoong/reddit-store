I live in a small subdivision and have 5 neighbors total on my street.\n\nFor the past few years during the winter when we're getting a lot of snow or a bad storms, as I'm leaving for my overnight shift at around 8-9pm I'll put my wifes windshield wipers up on her car and do a quick walk around to my other 5 neighbors and put their windshield wipers up on their cars (obviously not if they're outside or something, but if it looks like they're in for the night). Many of them forget to do this, as many of them have children and it typically slips their mind, and their wipers will be frozen to their car in the morning. \n\nIt's just something nice I like to do to look out for my neighbors. They're all always grateful of this and thank me for it. Many of them started doing it too and there will be nights where I'll forget to put mind and my wifes up, and in the morning one of the neighbors has done it for us.\n\nAnyway recently one of our neighbor's moved and a new family moved in as of last week. It's a young couple and their two young children. The other night I was leaving for my overnight shift at around 9pm. It was snowing really heavy and we were supposed to be getting almost 30cm of snow and it was FREEZING out. So I put my wifes wipers up and do my usual quick walk around to the other neighbors.\n\nI was hesitant when I reached my new neighbors house, as I've only introduced myself once, but did it anyway. As I was putting the second wiper up on their pick up truck the husband came charging out of his front door yelling \"HEY WHAT THE F\\*CK ARE YOU DOING TO MY TRUCK?\" I tried to explain to him I was just putting his wipers up to help him. He continued to scream at me to \"get the hell off my property and don't touch my shit AGAIN!\". The wife then came out and started yelling at me too. I apologized and started walking away. Some of my other neighbors heard the commotion and came outside to see what was happening. \n\nThey tried explaining to him too that it's just something we do, both of them wasn't having it.\n\nFast forward to this morning, I'm arriving home from my overnight shift and as I'm walking in I see the wife of this couple struggling outside to break the ice off the windshield wipers of the truck. Guess she was trying to take her kids to school and the wipers were frozen solid on the car.\n\nShe sees me and yells over \"Hey there! Do you mind giving me a hand please?\" I look over to her and yell back \"No sorry, thought I was to never touch your shit again ma'am\" and walked back inside. She yelled back at me \"wow AH!\".\n\nTold my wife about this, she thinks I should've helped her because she was just trying to get her kids to school. I disagree as I was just following what they told me.

No thank you.\n\nIt would be different, possibly, if they had listened when you tried explaining, or if they had apologized before this incident.

That doesn't make you the asshole.", "NTA for refusing to help. I understand why the neighbors might have had the initial \"wtf get away from my truck\" reaction, but that's only excusable for like 30 seconds. Once you explained that you were trying to help (and they saw that literally every other car had the wipers up), they should have AT MINIMUM apologized for yelling at you, even if they didn't want to accept your help.\n\nIt's good to refuse help to people who rejected your help, especially for the exact problem you tried to help them with.

And LOL! It would have been so hard for me to not just crack up hysterically in her face!\n\nThey dont get to be completely rude and unreasonable to you over something so trivial and then expect you to help them out after. Let her learn her lesson the hard way!", "NTA but this was quite petty. This may have been a good opportunity to apologise for touching their cars without permission and explaining the situation where neighbours will put each others wipers up, and getting them involved in your community a bit more. I'm sure the payback was satisfying (and not entirely undeserved), but they're going to consider you an AH from now on, which is a shame.", "NTA. She has a perfectly asshole husband that can take care of it", "NTA. I could understand the initial shock of seeing an almost stranger out at night touching my vehicle, but after you explained and they were still AHs then at that point they've made their bed, you just let them lie in it.

However, they didn't listen to you or your neighbors explaining and doubled down. This is on them. What you do is to prevent this and not have to fiddle with ice in the morning", "NTA. I can respect that they were maybe thrown off by you initially trying to put their wipers up, but there was no reason for either them to come at you so aggressively. Her lack of planning does not constitute an emergency on your part. If she's been around snow and lived in Canada for any amount of time, I'd guess she is familiar with what the weather is like and should have planned accordingly.", "Ok so the answer seems overwhelmingly that you\u2019re NTA, however I would like to play devils advocate.

I can imagine their initial confusion, but when YOU tried to explain and the NEIGHBORS tried to explain and they\u2019re still being hostile? They\u2019re on their own. I\u2019m so sorry about your grumpy neighbors. Maybe they had really horrible neighbors before and will take a while to understand selfless kindness? Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "It\u2019s rare to have a payback happen so quickly. If she wanted help, she (and her husband) should apologize before asking. They need to learn a lesson about being rude and unneighborly. It sounds like they are from Boston.", "YTA\n\nI mean, yeah, you were the asshole for just assuming that your 'good intentions' give you license to trespass and interfere with other people's property.\n\nIt's fine that you don't want to give them a hand, but don't go around pretending that they were some how out of line for not wanting their shit messed with to begin with.", "Side note- sounds like ur living in America not Canada. Geeze. Lol", "Nta \n\n You got yelled at before trying to help. ( Which I don't understand the wipers up thing if they fall they're going to bust the windshield.

They shouldn't expect any neighborhood interactions lol", "NTA-the fact that she can cuss you out the night before and then turn around and expect you to help when you already tried is baffling.

You should have recommended they use warm water to their windshield wipers.", "NTA You already tried to be nice and neighborly and they decided it was ok to respond to that by being an ah.

But once you explained and the neighbours also explained to clear up misunderstanding, they really should have apologized. They got what they deserved with frozen wipers in the morning.", "NTA. Look you tried to be kind to a new neighbor and they bit your head off. It\u2019s pretty common to put your wipers up if there\u2019s going to be a lot of snow or freezing rain to avoid the frozen wipers on the windshield. That is something everyone in cold climates learns at one point. It\u2019s too bad your neighbor was an jerk to you for trying to be kind. Hopefully, your neighbor learned a lesson and now you both can exist without bothering each other too much.", "NTA but yeah dude you\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get shot. If I looked out my window and saw some random guy I didn\u2019t know cranking my windshield wipers back I would have a problem with that too.\n\nAnd also, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just my car or if it\u2019s the design of the Volvo S 60, but on my car I can\u2019t do that with the driver side because the hood is too close and the few times I\u2019ve tried it I chipped paint off the edge of the hood, of course I\u2019m the only one that can see it from the driver seat, but it bothers me.

You tried rationally explain what you were doing, so did your neighbors, they cussed you out and told you to get off the property. They also told you not to touch their property.

My parents live in Mississauga and they do this for their neighbours (and vice-versa). The neighbours also help with the shoveling which I am 100% grateful for since the parents are a little older and it\u2019s hard for me to get to their place to shovel.

Man, I\u2019ve apologized so many times because I didn\u2019t understand what someone else was trying to do.  Give them an opportunity to do the right thing.

Bad karma's a bitch. She just found out what happens when you bite a helpful hand.", "NTA - Their reaction was extreme, but not everyone is used to living in a neighborhood where people help each other out this way. They may also be new to living in a climate where putting up the wipers is necessary. They are new to the area, it was dark, the weather was bad, they have kids in the house - I can *kind of* understand them being upset to find a stranger on their property touching their vehicle late at night. I can even see how the rest of your neighbors coming over to argue with them in your defense may not have helped in that moment.  \n\nThat being said, she should have been able to put 2 and 2 together the next morning when her windshield wipers were frozen to the windshield and everyone else's were up.

I'm a mechanic, one day I realized I diagnosed my next door neighbors car, when I was home I was hanging out with my other neighbors drinking, when I saw the other neighbor was home I went and knocked on their door to provide them with my personal opinion rather than professional. They didn't even open the door and asked me to leave their property. I was upset, I just wanted to do a good deed.

Guaranteed, if you did something and her wiper broke, they\u2019d never stop bitching.", "NTA\n\nThey flat out told you never to touch their stuff again.  And yelled at you for it.

Why do so many people think OP was justified in touching the neighbours car without asking first? It's not like they weren't around. So now OP and his neighbours are in the awkward position of both sides thinking they have nothing to apologise for.\n\nOf course I agree with your last point about OPs responsibility, but I disagree that there have been enough indicators to know how the neighbours behave all the time.

People are quick to condemn the neighbours for yelling at OP and not accepting their explaination, but seem to be overlooking the fact that OP was on their property and touching their things.

They moved and are new to this area and somebody touches their vehicle late in the evening. Because of that, to me it is ok to be yelling. However, once OP explained himself they should have stopped with berating him and apologized. Not only because what OP did was nice but also because I cannot understand why somebody would want to make a new enemy in their own neighbourhood (especially since OP did nothing wrong).", "I grew up in Wisconsin and I never saw this until I moved to New Jersey.", "Agree. New Englander here. When I know I'll have time to let the defroster run in the morning, I prefer to leave them down in the front. It can sometimes take longer to clear the packed and icy snow under the wiper than to just clear it from the top.", "It's debated whether you even should or not. I'm in Saskatchewan and I've only ever seen it once. Seems like a good way to get a wiper snapped off in the wind.\n\n[https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/heres-why-you-shouldnt-put-the-wipers-up-on-your-car-when-it-snows](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/heres-why-you-shouldnt-put-the-wipers-up-on-your-car-when-it-snows)\n\nhttps://www.thedrive.com/news/39327/dont-put-your-windshield-wipers-up-in-winter", "That blows my mind. I learned in elementary school that typically you do favors for your friends (and vice-versa), not \"non-friends\" or even enemies. Why would you expect a \"favor\" from a non-friend you aren't paying?", "I get what you're saying, but I wouldn't help the very next morning after that. Like OP, I would leave them with it, but happily offer help in the future.\n\nThe trying to help, being insulted, frozen wipers, is all still the same incident. Helping immediately after being cussed out would feel like letting them walk over me. Let this one incident cycle out, be helpful again later.", "My car also does this, but there's also a way to put them in the \"wiper change\" position where they can be stood up without timing turning off the car at exactly the right time. It involves holding the wiper lever down for 3+ seconds while the car is off.\n\nOP, I'm a little torn between E S H and N T A because, as some others have mentioned, it can be damaging to the wipers, springs, and windshield if you're not careful. I presume you wouldn't be taking responsibility for a cracked windshield if you did this, they didn't stop you, and the wind blew hard enough to bring the wiper crashing down on their windshield. If you have an understanding with some of your neighbors, great, but I have lived in places that get plenty of snow, and some people put their wipers up (and I've done it myself), but I wouldn't want someone making that decision for me. Then again, I also wouldn't ask someone to help me defrost my windshield.\n\nThat's what a kettle full of hot water is for. (/s)", "Or like casually go clear my car off and stop and shoot the shit with neighbors. Pull up to the struggling woman like *oh no what happened? Ahh dang too bad there was no way this could be prevented. Hey have a lovely morning!*\n\nOne thing I would not do is help that woman in that situation. I can't even believe OPs wife would suggest that. He was being a kind neighbor and they behaved disgracefully. Then the wife had an opportunity to humble herself a bit and ask for help but chose instead to be rude. Fuck them.\n\nNTA and there's not even a debate to be had here.", "In weather this cold? Wow---you're a glutton for punishment!", "Honestly, I\u2019d probably still be suspicious until the other neighbors vouched for them. Then I\u2019d apologize for the misunderstanding. \n\nThat said, I would hesitate to touch a new neighbor\u2019s car at all before asking them. Maybe it\u2019s a small town vs big city thing?", "fr i could 100% see myself coming out defensive then once the situation was explained id honestly just be so happy. thats a really nice thing to do and honestly something i wouldnt have thought of (i live in the south and rarely get snow/ice) \n\nop youre nta but, jesus, your neighbors are!", "Yea the initial upset about wipers, I can totally see. But I wouldn't be upset after an explanation,  and I certainly wouldn't fly out of the house screaming to begin with.", "Of course he did.", "According to the OP, husband came out yelling first, but the wife was not far behind, also coming out to yell at OP right after her husband.", "It's a good non confrontational way to let them know they've been spotted whilst also being able to see them.  \n\nA friendly person there to actually help you and up with a nice conversation.  Someone up to no good exits ASAP.  A psycho stabs you and wears your intestines like a scarf... its not without its faults \ud83d\ude05\n\nEdit... ohh also, NTA!!!", " So I think you and the person who is replying to you are both kind of missing the point. You finish up with \"...but you aren't actually interested in helping them...\" and that's contrary to the message of the person who told this anecdote.\n\nIt's better than \"Wtf are you doing?\" because, as the original commenter mentions, there very well *may* be something you'd like to help with. He mentions selling his vehicle to someone whom he could have cursed out and yelled at initially.  He also recalls numerous people who just had questions about it. \n\nSecond of all, it assumes that you'd would like to remain friendly with the person you're asking. This is especially important if it's in the neighborhood where you normally reside.  You don't want to scream at your neighbor's stepkids if they really are just admiring the paint. Or, in the case of OP, you don't want to insult or anger your new neighbor when he was trying to be nice.  \n\nLastly, it's disarming. No confrontational. Helpful, even. That can really throw off criminals and evil doers. Screaming \"Wtf are you doing?!\" will make someone defensive and getting \"Hey fuck you, I'm just out for a walk!!\" back wouldn't be out of line. With this, it encourages the good and can confuse the bad, who aren't expecting it.", "The point of \"anything I can help you with\" is that it sounds polite and unassuming, and probably less likely to turn into an immediate beatdown if the thieves want to stand and fight for the stolen property rather than get spooked by a voice and running...", "That\u2019s nuts to me that your wiper motor was strong enough to snap your wiper. I\u2019ve never had this happen on any of my vehicles.", "what were you driving? Like u/didnebeu said, I've never seen such strong wiper motors and now I want them", "They were a couple that has far more money than sense. They ended up selling the house a couple of years later and moving to a luxury condo because home ownership was \"too hard.\"\n\nBuh-bye. My friends were NOT sad to see them go.", "Yeah, I wouldn't appreciate it, especially as my wipers can't be lifted to the point the stay unless I go inside and move them to a special position.  Otherwise if you try to lift them more than an inch or two you're going to scratch the paint or break the wiper", "I'd also be pretty sus about a stranger touching up on my car until the neighbors came. Just never lived in a nice neighborhood like theirs, lol\n\nThis does seem like a situation where OP should have asked prior to handling the new neighbor's property. They may have lived in shady areas before.", "Bwahaha", "[removed]", "Saw a comment once saying \"then again I am Petty LaBelle\"", "Doing as someone tells you, when you know the result will be something they don't want is the definition of malicious compliance. \"Please help me with X\" \"No, you told me not to touch X\" very easily fits that definition.", "To quote Airplane: \"Chump don' want no help, chump don't GET da help!\"", "Thanks, I must have skimmed over that part.", "I\u2019m a she actually but the rest is spot on. I have been in the odd occasion where I have had to physically defend myself however I believe the way you talk and hold yourself has more often than not meant that people prefer to run. Most thieves are only confident in taking when they won\u2019t get caught. They aren\u2019t brave!", "The funny bit is I drive a Smart Car Passion. \n\nIt might have been a one off fluke accident TBH.", "Just replied above! :) \n\nIt's a Smart Car Passion. Just needed to buy a replacement blade ($30-60 CAD) so all things considered not terrible, however, if it can be avoided haha", "what are you chipping away with that you're worrying you'll break a wiper?", "Yeah it's really a one person job.", "Like Tubs in League of Gentlemen?", "Well I am British and they are very polite words but when said with the right nuance they can also sounds quite threatening. But your option to go either direction is easy after a simple line so if they are up to no good you can start the sweating and if they aren\u2019t then you end up having drinks together in the local later.", "This", "It is always better to ask a question because they are more likely to answer too in which case you do see their face and heat their voice, all identifying things.", "Soft YTA only because there were kids involved.  If there are kids, you help, even if the parents suck.  \n\n. . . but on the other hand, that\u2019s some first class karma there, and I have to respect the perfect comeback.", "If you're asking are you the AH, yes... HOWEVER it is 100000000% justified.  Sometimes people just need a taste of their own medicine to understand.", "Was the answer a bit petty? yes. Did she bring it on herself? Also yes. NTA", "NTA. Don't yell at people and later expect help.", "Just because you weren't wrong doesn't mean you were right...its never the wrong time to do the right thing(some smart dude said something like that)\nThat being said...they asked for it...I suppose it would have been good to show those children how their fellow humans SHOULD be treated as I doubt they are learning that lesson at home...but still, she deserved it", "NTA, you complied to their request \nr/maliciouscompliance", "NTA but also a heads up that if it's a really windy day, would not suggest doing this because if your wipers are frozen, up, and there's enough wind to knock them back down, there's a possibility of your windshield getting cracked by the wiper. As soon as I heard that happening to someone, I stopped putting mine up and instead have a cover for my windshield/wipers that I use now.", "Agreed\n\nThey dug their own grave, they can live in it\n\nNTA", "This 100%.  NTA.  Those neighbors need to learn real quick that you don\u2019t make enemies of the only 5 family\u2019s within walking distance of your home", "And what do you want to bet if he HAD helped, they would later blame him for something \"wrong\" with the wipers and yell at him and insist he replace them, or some such nonsense.", "If you had helped, I could totally see their windshield cracking in a month and them somehow finding a way to blame you for it.  They've shown their true colors.  Stay clear.", ">NTA for refusing to help. I understand why the neighbors might have had the initial \"wtf get away from my truck\" reaction, but that's only excusable for like 30 seconds. Once you explained that you were trying to help (and they saw that literally every other car had the wipers up), they should have AT MINIMUM apologized for yelling at you, even if they didn't want to accept your help.  \n>  \n>It's good to refuse help to people who rejected your help, especially for the exact problem you tried to help them with. They'll either solve the problem themselves or learn not to shout so much before getting the facts.\n\nThat and, once being ordered off their property, if OP goes back to the property, he is committing an offense for which he can be arrested: trespassing.\n\nThis isn't a stretch by the way, folks that are this hostile can, and will, call the cops on ya. Why risk it? Maybe the cops come, maybe they don't, but they have made their intentions clear. No contact, and if they \"change their mind\", can you really trust someone that's changing their mind like that to be rational?", "Holy shit why are all the replies on this comment locked?", "I can somewhat understand being aggressive if a stranger is touching your car, but calling someone an AH simply because they said they couldn\u2019t help is crazy", "People really need to learn to be nice or at least cordial to their neighbors. They literally know where you live and they can save your ass on so many occasions if you have eachothers contacts and trust eachother. We had a neighbor that everyone hated because he neglected his dogs and was unnecessarily aloof and rude. He moved because it was more and more apparent to him that people hated his guts.", "Not only did they not apologize, they also still did not put their fucking wipers up! At least two people explained to you why you should do that, and you refuse to listen? Yeah, there's a couple of assholes here, but OP, You are NTA.", "Absolutely! We don't know things from the other couple's perspective.\n\nWe've had one vehicle stolen and another one vandalized (two different events that occurred at two different places we've lived at). I am on high alert now when it comes to people lurking around our property and vehicles. If I looked out and seen some random dude in my driveway touching my vehicle, I would not be nice about it, either.\n\nBTW you sound like an awesome neighbor to have and likely saved those guys some serious cash!", "OP already ***had*** introduced himself and was already being 'the good neighbor', the newcomers are  'bad neighbors' who had  a great opportunity to do the right thing = apologize, the very next morning. Instead the wife confused OP with a suddenly useful doormat and instantly reverted to abusive language when OP politely declined to 'touch their shit', so he ***already knows*** exactly where the boundary is.\n\nActions have consequences as the nasty new neighbors are only just beginning to realize.", "NTA   You followed their directions. You were told not to touch their belongings. Even after neighbors had told them what you were doing, they doubled down.", "I would shovel all the sidewalks on the street except in front of their house.", "If I was the AH neighbor (though I'd probably be more, uh, excuse me, whatcha doing?), and yelled at OP who outright told me he's putting my wipers up, then the next day am dealing with the results of my actions I absolutely would've said \"Hey sorry, guess you were right\" and then maybe very politely and ashamedly ask for help.\n\nOPs totally NTA", "I agree with this but honestly in the heat of the moment not everyone demeanor will change so quickly too", "Unfortunately, these neighbors will most likely go into a downward spiral and continue to hate OP, as they have seemingly spited them.

She's just a really toxic person, screams at our building staff, spreads horrible rumors and gossip about the other tenants.

I don't even say hello if we're both on the elevator.  She doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned.

Ice was no longer the problem after the windshield shattered.", "1) It would be worth it.  \n2) It still wouldn't be as bad as when we had white out conditions in Newfoundland  \n3) I would be wearing clothes, y'know?    >:)    Probably.", "Having lived in both (very) big cities and small towns, I don't think that's entirely it. It's more about the atmosphere of the neighborhood and how close-knit you are with the neighbors around you. I've lived in apartment buildings or on blocks in big cities where everyone knew each other and helped each other out, even total strangers, in things like this: for example, in New York, I regularly saw people who were total strangers pick up someone's stroller, lift it up the stairs, put it down, and walk away *without ever talking to the person who owned the stroller.* I've also lived in small suburban towns where everyone pretended they didn't have neighbors. I think I would be more likely to get yelled at in some of the small suburban towns than in New York.", "Thanks!", "Malicious compliance is following instructions to the letter despite knowing that the consequences of following the instructions can be disastrous or humorous for/at the expense of the person who told you to do or not do something.
