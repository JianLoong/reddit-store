There is this one girl in my school (16 F), I\u2019ll call her Kayla, she has this competing kind of drive that everyone in my school crazy. But lets get on with the story.\n\nKayla always had a crush on me, she has been very open about it and even called me \u201cbabe\u201d in front of other friends/strangers. I of course always get mad at her, and she would cry and go to her mommy and daddy (yes she still calls her parents mommy and daddy). But she doesn\u2019t know that I am very gay. Me and my cousin Charlotte do everything together, it is a running joke in the family that we\u2019re almost siblings.\n\nWhen Kayla saw me and Charlotte walking together to the movies, she went nuts; like literal nuts, she was almost white of rage, fire coming out of her mouth as she said that somehow I was cheating on her and that I need to go with her so she could discipline me for cheating? I said no and  Charlotte did to.\n\nIn school she wasn\u2019t talking to me or anyone for days, we all celebrated with pizza. No one in the school likes her, when someone has something, she would buy it and take three of them to school, or when I had an operation to get my appendix removed, she said that she did that three times; we all burst out laughing and didn\u2019t stop until the bell ran. She ran (like always) to her parents.\n\nThis is the part where I would be the asshole: When me Charlotte were bowling she came to me and said that she was much better than that whore over there and she knows her parents and knows that she is already taken (which it true, she has a boyfriend who is basically adopted by the whole family), it was then when the bucket overflowed and it all came down. I went off about how she has been constant harassing me since she moved here, and that this girl she was so called competing with was my cousin and that I am gay, and came out for almost 1 year. Everyone in my town knows that I am gay and respect it. \n\nShe said I was an jerk for going off, but my cousin said that she was glad that I blew up. I have been getting phone calls all day saying that I can be turned straight and more.\n\nI kinda feel bad for her but also I\u2019m happy that I finally told her off.\n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1695107960, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mkane/aita_for_telling_a_girl_who_has_a_crush_on_me/", "score": 455, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
