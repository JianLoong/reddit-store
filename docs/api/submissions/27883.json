With my wife Olivia (F38), I have two kids (M7 and F5). With my ex-wife Emma (F40), I have three children (F10, M8, F6), and from my ex-ex wife Sophie (F42), I have one child (M12). I have maintained very good co-parenting relationships with Emma and Sophie, and even though we're separated now, I consider them to be very close friends.\n\nAll my children live with their mothers, and since we all live in the same city, they see each other regularly. The kids are close to each other and consider themselves normal siblings, which has also made things easier.\n\nRecently, I've been planning to take my children to visit my own parents (M75 and F71). They both recently retired, and I think they're starting to get bored with staying at home most days. So, I thought seeing the kids would cheer them up, and the kids are more than happy to see (and get spoiled by) their grandparents.\n\nMy brother Brad (M37) is also going with his wife Samantha (F35) and their two kids (M6 and F4). So, the kids will get to see their cousins as well, which is nice. I planned a date with my brother and parents, and we decided that Thanksgiving weekend (which is next weekend in Canada) works best for all of us.\n\nWhile Emma and Sophie are alright with the idea of me taking the kids, Olivia is not. When I told her about the idea this morning, she told me that she wanted us to go out for dinner or something over the weekend since we hadn't gone out in a while.\n\nShe only expressed this to me after I told her about the plan. When I mentioned that the kids wanted to see their relatives (as they all expressed interest in the idea), she said that I needed to prioritize spending \u201cexpected time\u201d with her over \u201centertaining my extended family.\u201d I asked her then if she wanted to accompany me and the kids to my parents' house, and then we could find some time to go out, but she refused this proposal.\n\nI was a little annoyed at this stage, so I said that I thought she was being difficult and not willing to compromise. We argued for a bit, and then she said she had to go to work. Before she did, I reiterated that I\u2019d be taking the kids to my parents.\n\nAITA?\n\nContext - Forgot to mention earlier, but Olivia was aware of the planning process. During this time, she seemed fine with going with me and the kids to visit my parents. Once the plan was finalized, she indicated that she'd rather stay and that we go out for dinner instead.", "created_utc": 1696001367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16veppq/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_ill_be_taking_the/", "score": 1116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
