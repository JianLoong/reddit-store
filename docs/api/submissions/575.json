This travel consists on going to parties, and basically kissing other people, drinking a lot of alcohol, etc. So me (f17yo) have a friend called Aldana(17f) that has a lot of friends. Last year, when we where organaizing this travel, she invited some of this friend. If we're honest, noone wanted them to come with us, but we were ok. In this group there are three relevant people: War(18f), Puma(18m) and Taco(17m), Puma was in a relationship with Aldana, and then is when I met Taco. I didn't like him but he was there and i was ok with that. I'm not gonna explain the whole story, but Puma was suffering a couple crisis with Aldana and, for a reason that i don't know, War had a big fight with ald. W got angry by sth (don't ask me why, she never explained it) and she 'stole' the whole group from ald. Back to 2022, this guy Taco and a friend of him Ocean (m19) came with us to the travel. I wasn't expecting to spend time with them, but one of the boys that came from our group is their friends and this two guys followed him. I discovered that Taco actually was a funny and good guy. He's totally my type and he has no problem at interacting with me I told Aldana how i felted and she gave me this upset sight while saying that it was ok. I don't wanna have a boyfriend, but maybe kiss him? I can't denny that my stomach hurts when I think about him. He didn't do anything to aldana but stop being her friend and sometimes I also want to do it. But I might be wrong about this.
