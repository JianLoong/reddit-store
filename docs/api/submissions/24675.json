My stepdaughter is half White-American and half Mexican-American. Her dad is White and her mom is Mexican. I\u2019ve known my stepdaughter since she was 3. Something to know about her is that she is very introverted and shy. She doesn\u2019t like massive crowds or loud music and especially hates big parties.  \n\n\nMy stepdaughter\u2019s mom began to plan a Quince\u00f1era for her a few months back. I\u2019ve always had a great relationship with my SD's mom so when she asked me to pitch in and help wherever I could I agreed.. I found it surprising SD agreed to have a Quince\u00f1era. When I asked her about it she told me she never agreed to one. She told her mom she didn\u2019t want one but her mom is going through with it anyway. She asked dad and me to talk to her mom on her behalf to change her mind. We did but mom didn\u2019t budge.   \n\n\nThat was a few months ago. As the date of the Quince\u00f1era neared SD came to me and asked if I would help her avoid the party. I agreed because I could tell she really didn\u2019t want this party. I asked her what she wanted to do instead. SD is a very big nature person. She likes hiking a lot. So we agreed that I\u2019d take her on a hiking trip instead of the party. We didn't tell her mom. SD just wasn't showing up. We told her multiple times SD never wanted a party but she decided to have one anyway. My husband told us he would go to the Quince\u00f1era to help handle things when people figured out SD wasn't coming.  \n\n\nToday I was supposed to take SD to the Quince\u00f1era. Instead I took her on the hiking trip she wanted and after that I took her to a friend's house so she could cut a cake to celebrate her 15th birthday with them. It was a great day.   \n\n\nOf course, SD's mom was not happy when she found out she planned a party with hundreds of guests only for the main focus of the party didn't show up. She kept calling us throughout the day but we ignored all the calls. My husband tried to keep her calm but of course she was angry. I knew it was going to be a shitshow when she confronted me but I was willing to face that.   \n\n\nLater today at home she came to confront me and my SD. She was furious. She was yelling at me, my SD and husband. After she finished her rant I told her to get the fuck off my property and that this was a lesson to pay attention to what her daughter wants. My SD politely asked her mom to leave. She got into her car and left with tears in her eyes.

Obviously, your SD's mother is TA for ignoring her SD's wishes when it was her birthday. I also don't think you should be blamed for doing something that your SD really wanted. It's her birthday - she gets to decide what she wants to do. The problem is here is you should have communicated to your SD's mom that there was just no way SD was going to a party she was unhappy with. Instead, you just took off without the main guest **without warning.** SD's mom may not win mother of the year anytime soon but she at least deserves to know where her daughter is, not to mention she spent all that time, effort and money to prepare for a party that's very important to their culture.", "NTA. Good parenting by you and dad/husband here. Mom wanted the party, not for SD's sake, but her own, and it was her self-absorbed moment that got ruined, whereas the actual birthday girl had a great time. I think this counts as \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\" When you don't listen, you can't blame people for not warning you.", "NTA. Though it would have been best to tell the mom about the plan, SD specifically asked not to more likely because her mom wouldn\u2019t have accepted it. There are people saying you have slapped the mom\u2019s culture but as a fellow Hispanic I don\u2019t see how forcing a girl to do something she doesn\u2019t want to is a good thing. Quince\u00f1eras, despite their cultural significance, are essentially lavish parties. Mom wanted to celebrate that more for herself than for her daughter. My sister doesn\u2019t want a quince\u00f1era because she too dislikes large parties due to noise and having to be the center of attention puts her into her shell. When my mom asked her if she wanted a quince\u00f1era she said she would like to go on a vacation. My mom does want pictures taken of my sister in a quince\u00f1era dress and my sister is fully on board as long as she can wear sneakers instead of heels and my mom was perfectly fine with that. The quince\u00f1era is ultimately to celebrate the girl coming of age, and what better way to do that than how they want it to be done. \n\nTLDR Quince\u00f1eras aren\u2019t for everyone and you can\u2019t force the birthday girl to partake in it against her will. Wizards of Waverly Place literally covered this subject once.", "You took her hiking. Beyond that this was 100% her dad\u2019s decision on what to do and how to handle. There is no reason for her mom to be mad at you if he managed this upfront. \n\nHe should have told the mom early in the planning process that SD would not be attending a Quince that she didn\u2019t want. Just matter of fact, repeating over and over that she wasn\u2019t going to be there. I don\u2019t think it was YOUR job to tell her. I love that you are close, but he should be the face to the mom and she can direct her complaints to him.  Otherwise the dynamic can get sideways fast. \n\nHe could have told any friends or family who asked about the upcoming party that \u201cSD and I aren\u2019t going to be there. She doesn\u2019t want a big party.\u201d  No further explanation needed.  Then no one can say they were surprised or ambushed or deceived.  Dad would not have even had to be there. He could have come along with you guys. The hike would have felt better knowing the mom and anyone who asked had been informed.\n\nI get that she was afraid her mom would make her life a living hell between telling her and the day of the party, but I worry she\u2019s learned to \u201cplay along and then ghost\u201d.  It feels easier but can be a bad habit to develop if you are introverted.\n\nIt\u2019s less insulting to the culture if you are open and transparent with everyone.", "ESH. The mom was obviously wrong to completely disregard her daughter\u2019s wishes and go ahead w the party she wanted. But other commenters are right about the quincea\u00f1era being culturally significant, not to mention that the party must have cost a ton of money. After trying to explain SD\u2019s pov a few times, I think stating outright that she would be with you during your husband\u2019s scheduled time and you\u2019d be celebrating privately (maybe even invite mom over for cake) would have been the best route. Leaving the drama to unfold during the party seems unnecessary and is where it leaves NTA territory for me.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour stepdaughters mom threw a party FOR HERSELF, not for SD.

When I was 15 I wanted my parents to use the money they saved for my party to be spent on a family holiday. My mother wasn't happy at first that I broke the tradition since she had planned the event for quite some time and imagined it as if it was her party, but we ended up having a nice time.

Bio mom is the X factor but at least it would remove the feeling that SD was sort of hijacked the whole day without communication which is the only part I really object with.", "Nta, u did what her mother should have done, listening to her wishes for her birthday", "NTA\n\nAll of you told bio mom repeatedly that the birthday girl did NOT want the big party.    \nIt doesn\u2019t sound like anyone told biomom ahead of time that the birthday girl was not going to attend, so that was a bit of an AH move, but I do get it.  Considering dad went ahead and went to the party to tell everyone that BDay girl declined the invite, and you and he arranged for her to spend her birthday in a way she wanted.", "NTA\n\nI do agree with some of the comments that the SD should have outright told her mom she was not going to the party.  This way the mother would only have herself to blame when she spent time and money on a party without a guest of honor.

The birthday girl said no, constantly, dad said no constantly, you said no constantly, mom wouldn't listen.  She didn't care about how her own child feels.  All she cared about was the party, and looking good for others.  If SD would have been forced to go she would have been miserable, uncomfortable, and felt more unheard by her mother than she already was.  She would not have had good memories of the party, only emotional turmoil for being forced into a situation she was highly uncomfortable with.  Being forced to go to the party would have caused damage to her relationships with you, her dad, and her mother since no one listened to her.  I'm glad you, and her dad listened to her.  At least she knows someone in her family will put her needs, wants, and feelings first.  All of this will stay with her for a long time to come, and mom needs to realize she may have just done irrepairable damage to her relationship with her daughter.", "Oof. I relate so hard to this and wish someone had been there for me when I was a teen like this step mom. I was forced to have birthday parties growing up and a haaaaated them\u2026mostly because my mom was/is an absolute Bible nutjob and I wasn\u2019t allowed music, tv, and all the other basic things other teens wanted and did. So, birthday parties were insanely embarrassing for me to have absolutely no entertainment for my guests. We literally just sat there and had nothing to talk about that wouldn\u2019t offend my mom. Each year I begged harder and harder to not have a birthday party and each year it failed. It was awful. The step mom here is a hero. Asking her step daughter what SHE actually wanted for her birthday. Bravo!!

Not particularly. But that's beside the point. She's her mother, and she gets to make those choices. You don't; you're a stepparent, *not* a legal guardian. Your husband should have outright said, 'SD has asked us to go hiking on that day. We will be doing that and we will not be forcing her to attend a party.' Instead, you said 'SD doesn't want this', but didn't say a word about not bringing her. You let her spend all of that money and then be humiliated because her stepmother took her daughter elsewhere, without her permission.\n\nThat's the main AH bit. You do not have the legal right to withhold her daughter from a pre-planned event. Your husband does - why on earth was he not present at the hike? The fact that it was *just you* is a major problem. The mother could argue parental alienation and worse because you, not her legal parent or guardian, withheld her daughter for a big *cultural* moment in her life. She could also sue for the costs of the party that you let her throw without stating that SD will not be going. If you think people aren't going to accuse you of racism for this, you're wrong. A Quince\u00f1era is a BIG DEAL in Mexican culture, and you just ... ignored that. You decided that you knew better. That's not your place.\n\nAnd then, when the mother confronts you, you swore at her. You just set fire to any happy co-parenting relationship you had. This will fester. The mother will *never* forgive you for your behaviour, or your words. Her relationship with her daughter is going to be profoundly damaged by this - did neither of you think about that? I understand that you have been around a long time and clearly have a good relationship with your stepdaughter, but you overstepped. Massively and in horribly disrespectful ways. You're the adult in this situation, and refusing to communicate with your SD's mother was an immature way to handle this.", "YTA, it just doesn't seem right you took this womans daughter with you and didn't even answer her calls.  \n\nI understand she was probably wrong for still pushing for the party, although her daughter didn't want it, but here's the thing, she is the parent. It's not like she's abusing the child, she was throwing her a party. Actually, not just a party, a huge culturally important expensive event.  \nHonestly, lots of parents do a lot of stuff that either anoy their kids, or kids feel forced to do. Sometimes it's for their own good, like putting on a coat when it's cold and they just don't want to, and sometimes it's maybe for the good of the parent, like the mom wanted this event for her daughter because it's something big in their culture. Also, who knows, maybe the daughter would've liked it in the end, or regrets not going to her quince later in life. \n\nThe thing is, you just did what you thought was right for the kid, and took that choice from her mother. And then didn't even have the balls to answer her calls. \nImo, it would be better if you helped your stepdaughter by being there for her on her quince, and if she really hated it  after giving it a chance, then you could have pulled her out with some excuse like she's not feeling well or whatever.
