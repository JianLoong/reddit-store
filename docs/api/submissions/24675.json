My stepdaughter is half White-American and half Mexican-American. Her dad is White and her mom is Mexican. I\u2019ve known my stepdaughter since she was 3. Something to know about her is that she is very introverted and shy. She doesn\u2019t like massive crowds or loud music and especially hates big parties.  \n\n\nMy stepdaughter\u2019s mom began to plan a Quince\u00f1era for her a few months back. I\u2019ve always had a great relationship with my SD's mom so when she asked me to pitch in and help wherever I could I agreed.. I found it surprising SD agreed to have a Quince\u00f1era. When I asked her about it she told me she never agreed to one. She told her mom she didn\u2019t want one but her mom is going through with it anyway. She asked dad and me to talk to her mom on her behalf to change her mind. We did but mom didn\u2019t budge.   \n\n\nThat was a few months ago. As the date of the Quince\u00f1era neared SD came to me and asked if I would help her avoid the party. I agreed because I could tell she really didn\u2019t want this party. I asked her what she wanted to do instead. SD is a very big nature person. She likes hiking a lot. So we agreed that I\u2019d take her on a hiking trip instead of the party. We didn't tell her mom. SD just wasn't showing up. We told her multiple times SD never wanted a party but she decided to have one anyway. My husband told us he would go to the Quince\u00f1era to help handle things when people figured out SD wasn't coming.  \n\n\nToday I was supposed to take SD to the Quince\u00f1era. Instead I took her on the hiking trip she wanted and after that I took her to a friend's house so she could cut a cake to celebrate her 15th birthday with them. It was a great day.   \n\n\nOf course, SD's mom was not happy when she found out she planned a party with hundreds of guests only for the main focus of the party didn't show up. She kept calling us throughout the day but we ignored all the calls. My husband tried to keep her calm but of course she was angry. I knew it was going to be a shitshow when she confronted me but I was willing to face that.   \n\n\nLater today at home she came to confront me and my SD. She was furious. She was yelling at me, my SD and husband. After she finished her rant I told her to get the fuck off my property and that this was a lesson to pay attention to what her daughter wants. My SD politely asked her mom to leave. She got into her car and left with tears in her eyes.

Obviously, your SD's mother is TA for ignoring her SD's wishes when it was her birthday. I also don't think you should be blamed for doing something that your SD really wanted. It's her birthday - she gets to decide what she wants to do. The problem is here is you should have communicated to your SD's mom that there was just no way SD was going to a party she was unhappy with. Instead, you just took off without the main guest **without warning.** SD's mom may not win mother of the year anytime soon but she at least deserves to know where her daughter is, not to mention she spent all that time, effort and money to prepare for a party that's very important to their culture.", "NTA. Good parenting by you and dad/husband here. Mom wanted the party, not for SD's sake, but her own, and it was her self-absorbed moment that got ruined, whereas the actual birthday girl had a great time. I think this counts as \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\" When you don't listen, you can't blame people for not warning you.", "NTA. Though it would have been best to tell the mom about the plan, SD specifically asked not to more likely because her mom wouldn\u2019t have accepted it. There are people saying you have slapped the mom\u2019s culture but as a fellow Hispanic I don\u2019t see how forcing a girl to do something she doesn\u2019t want to is a good thing. Quince\u00f1eras, despite their cultural significance, are essentially lavish parties. Mom wanted to celebrate that more for herself than for her daughter. My sister doesn\u2019t want a quince\u00f1era because she too dislikes large parties due to noise and having to be the center of attention puts her into her shell. When my mom asked her if she wanted a quince\u00f1era she said she would like to go on a vacation. My mom does want pictures taken of my sister in a quince\u00f1era dress and my sister is fully on board as long as she can wear sneakers instead of heels and my mom was perfectly fine with that. The quince\u00f1era is ultimately to celebrate the girl coming of age, and what better way to do that than how they want it to be done. \n\nTLDR Quince\u00f1eras aren\u2019t for everyone and you can\u2019t force the birthday girl to partake in it against her will. Wizards of Waverly Place literally covered this subject once.", "You took her hiking. Beyond that this was 100% her dad\u2019s decision on what to do and how to handle. There is no reason for her mom to be mad at you if he managed this upfront. \n\nHe should have told the mom early in the planning process that SD would not be attending a Quince that she didn\u2019t want. Just matter of fact, repeating over and over that she wasn\u2019t going to be there. I don\u2019t think it was YOUR job to tell her. I love that you are close, but he should be the face to the mom and she can direct her complaints to him.  Otherwise the dynamic can get sideways fast. \n\nHe could have told any friends or family who asked about the upcoming party that \u201cSD and I aren\u2019t going to be there. She doesn\u2019t want a big party.\u201d  No further explanation needed.  Then no one can say they were surprised or ambushed or deceived.  Dad would not have even had to be there. He could have come along with you guys. The hike would have felt better knowing the mom and anyone who asked had been informed.\n\nI get that she was afraid her mom would make her life a living hell between telling her and the day of the party, but I worry she\u2019s learned to \u201cplay along and then ghost\u201d.  It feels easier but can be a bad habit to develop if you are introverted.\n\nIt\u2019s less insulting to the culture if you are open and transparent with everyone.", "ESH. The mom was obviously wrong to completely disregard her daughter\u2019s wishes and go ahead w the party she wanted. But other commenters are right about the quincea\u00f1era being culturally significant, not to mention that the party must have cost a ton of money. After trying to explain SD\u2019s pov a few times, I think stating outright that she would be with you during your husband\u2019s scheduled time and you\u2019d be celebrating privately (maybe even invite mom over for cake) would have been the best route. Leaving the drama to unfold during the party seems unnecessary and is where it leaves NTA territory for me.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour stepdaughters mom threw a party FOR HERSELF, not for SD.

When I was 15 I wanted my parents to use the money they saved for my party to be spent on a family holiday. My mother wasn't happy at first that I broke the tradition since she had planned the event for quite some time and imagined it as if it was her party, but we ended up having a nice time.

Comment stolen from u/Background-Brick-420", "!bot", "At the end of the day we're talking about the needs and wants of a 15-year-old girl who explicitly said and I called she does not want a quinceanera, or am I wrong? And Opie with the help of the father may have gone behind the bioms back but keep in mind that it was like talking to a brick wall so culture outside or not it is still concerning the stepdaughter and all she wanted was a quiet day and she talked to the about mom but she didn't listen and it was up to Opie who took her feelings into consideration. Besides the bio mom practically embarrassed herself by planning something so luxurious as a quinceanera even though her daughter explicitly said she did not want one but wanted something such as rock climbing or hiking", "Bio mom deserved it", "Stepparents are often much better at parenting than biological parents.\n\nBio mom's cultural background isn't a trump card that means her opinion overrides everyone else's. \n\nCalling OP a \"cultural outsider\" is really gross and that's not a road you should go down.", "Why would the OP be expected to do that? It's the mother's responsibility to tell the guests about the cancellation - except she couldn't, because OP decided to be underhand about it. All OP had to do tell the mother that the daughter wouldn't be there. Sure, that might cause argument - but that's better than inconveniencing innocent guests - and the argument happened anyway!", "Taken into account is different to letting them be lead by their feelings and desires.  Children and adults need to learn how to do things that they don't necessarily relish.\n\nOne style of parenting is that if a child is shy they should never be pushed to expand their boundaries and should be left to grow into an introverted and antisocial person.  Another is that they should be helped to get coping mechanisms to deal with uncomfortable situations and develop social intelligence.  \n\nIt's not treating kids as property to want them to develop and grow into capable and sensitive adults.  You don't want that for property.", "Always funny when foreign parents move to and raise their kids in X country, and then are shocked that the kids turn out to be culturally X, and not really identify with the parents homeland culture and values.", "This is my concern. Poor kid is probably going to get screamed at when her dad and OP aren't around to protect her.", "Traditions are just peer pressure from the dead.", "No.\n\nTraditions and culture are things that people have created. They can change and evolve, or even discarded.  They are **not** required for someone to still be of that heritage.", ">I hope you reconsider. People 'force' kids to do stuff all the time.\n\nI'm aware of that HOWEVER on this occasion SD did NOT need to be forced into ANYTHING they don't want to.  \n\n>Quinceneria is just one more chore - a rite of passage that even the shy have to endure and then they can joke about it afterwards. \n\nNo they DONT have to endure an old tradition if they DONT want to. Just because someone calls something a \"tradition\" doesn't mean it can't be broken. \n\nBefore you claim I have no idea what a Quinceneria is I DO.\n\n\n>It can be good parenting to make kids push their boundaries rather than pander to their wishes all the time.\n\nIt can be SELFISH parenting to force a child to do something just because \"it's tradtion\" \n\n\nIn your eyes you are saying let's tell SD no matter what her feelings don't matter. Thankfully I'm raising my daughterS to know unless it's a needle(not just vaccines), dentist or school they have a choice, that they DONT have to do something that makes them uncomfortable.", "Yeah no, she has the biggest say when it's all about her, and she doesn't want it.", "Strongly disagree. Children or people shouldn't be forced into situations that make them that uncomfortable. Why should kids be forced in the presence of people they can't stand? Just because you're blood related to someone, doesn't mean you're obligated to maintain a good relationship with them no matter what.\n\nParents who constantly push their children's boundaries and force them in distressing situations shouldn't be surprised when their children go low contact once they get independent.\n\nSome things are understandable, like \"forcing\" your child to eat healthy, go to bed early, have good manners..., but forcing your very introverted child to be the center of the attention in front of hundreds of people is not it.\n\nAs a shy introvert I can tell you that it doesn't get much better no matter how many events I've been forced to go to. It's stressful and exhausting, it takes days to recharge. I don't enjoy myself and usually sneak out as soon as possible. I wish people respected introvert's nature and didn't try to change us.", "Agreed. I also dislike large parties, but I'm our director's ghostwriter so every year our new year's party for 800 colleagues is a huge part of my tasks.", "Finally a sensible comment.", "I can be bad parenting to force your kid to do something they don't want to do. Particularly when it's obviously for your own selfish satisfaction while you insist it's for the kid.\n\nPerhaps the biological mother will learn to respect boundaries and the people around her won't have to pander to her wishes all the time in the future.", "> and if this person doesn't want a birthday party or doesn't want a specific birthday party \n\nIt's really not.  This is a very modern / selfish viewpoint.  Do some research a coming of age celebration was actually also for the parents / clan to celebrate having successfully raised a member to adulthood as much - if not more than, for the child.  And that makes sense as who actually does most of the work in getting them there the child or their parents...?", "You mean being humiliated in front of a large group of people? Yeah, no thank you. I'll bet you don't understand what it's like to hate being the center of attention, only to be forced into situations like this by the people who supposedly love and care about you. Maybe you're someone who loves attention, and can't relate, so, good for you I guess. Why bring culture into this? It's the daughter's culture too, who are you to say which parts she must be forced to follow?", "The excuses reek of \"they didn't try hard enough to stop the mom so it's their fault too!\"\n\nThey communicated, she refused to listen.", "It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she had done this.", "Brides and grooms who hate weddings don\u2019t have them, they go to the justice of the peace or something small. That analogy doesn\u2019t work. Forcing someone to be the guest of honor at a party they don\u2019t want is an AH move.", "But this isn't comparable to a wedding or a kids' show because, presumably, the bride and groom or the kids are the ones who do want to be there and have people celebrate a moment with them. This was a party for the daughter, where she would be the guest of honor and in the spotlight, and she didn't want that.\n\nMom could've celebrated her daughter reaching adulthood in her own way, just the two of them, or with her own friends. But the important part is what the person the party is about wants. We put up with going to events we might not really want to go to because the people the event is about want us there. If the person being celebrated doesn't want it, especially when that person is a child, it doesn't teach them about community and socialization so much as it teaches them that what they want doesn't matter.", "How do you know they're a bot and not just an asshole?", "Parents forcing children to do things they\u2019re uncomfortable with in the name of tradition is incredibly toxic. This wasn\u2019t a temper tantrum or a last minute decision, she told her mother repeatedly for months she did not want this huge party. The mother did not listen, no compromise, no negotiation, nothing. Her way or the highway. And the daughter clearly isn\u2019t antisocial because OP mentioned they went to a friend\u2019s house. \n\nQuincea\u00f1eras are part of my culture as well, and things are changing. More and more girls are opting to do something different, like a trip or a smaller celebration.", "But then the question is- why do they need to do this thing? In OP's case, it was for no reason other than social expectations. The mom wanted it, the family wanted it, and the kid is just supposed to... suck it up to make the people around her happy? That's a dangerous precedent to set. I personally believe in teaching children that consent is essential, and you should never be forced to do something tha makes you uncomfortable just because people around you are expecting it.\n\nAfter all, that same logic is used to pressure SA victims into staying silent. The abuse is considered normal because the kid doesn't know how to say no.", "there\u2019s a difference between a child and a teen. might be a small difference, but by 15, op\u2019s stepdaughter is old enough to know what she\u2019s comfortable and uncomfortable with it has every right to express her feelings \u2014 she\u2019s not 8 anymore. high school sort of forces you to socialize enough, whether you want to or not. she\u2019s aged out of the \u201cforced socialization\u201d phase. her mother, being a good parent, should have respected her feelings and wishes. some people don\u2019t grow out of shyness \u2014 ever hear of social anxiety? it takes a lot of work to overcome it, and i don\u2019t think a large scale party with OP\u2019s stepdaughter as the center of attention would do anything but make her miserable and, in turn, make the rest of the party miserable. if the party wasn\u2019t for OP and instead for a relative, i\u2019d make the argument that she could at least show face for 20 minutes and say hi and bye to family and friends, but that\u2019s not what happened here. and who wants a miserable birthday girl anyway?\n\nedit: spelling/grammar :/", "I wonder what the mom would have done if the dad *had* told her ahead of time that her daughter would not show up for the party if mom insisted on throwing it.

That you get paid for?  Not even remotely the same.", "That would be a good point. If being a 15 year old girl was a job and having a quincinera was part of the job description.\n\nYou could always quit your job.

No one should be forced to accept any tradition that they don't like.", "Well, we live in a modern world, so I don't see anything wrong with having modern views.\n\nI would argue that it's the mother being selfish for forcing her daughter to have quinceanera and disregarding her wishes.
