My stepdaughter is half White-American and half Mexican-American. Her dad is White and her mom is Mexican. I\u2019ve known my stepdaughter since she was 3. Something to know about her is that she is very introverted and shy. She doesn\u2019t like massive crowds or loud music and especially hates big parties.  \n\n\nMy stepdaughter\u2019s mom began to plan a Quince\u00f1era for her a few months back. I\u2019ve always had a great relationship with my SD's mom so when she asked me to pitch in and help wherever I could I agreed.. I found it surprising SD agreed to have a Quince\u00f1era. When I asked her about it she told me she never agreed to one. She told her mom she didn\u2019t want one but her mom is going through with it anyway. She asked dad and me to talk to her mom on her behalf to change her mind. We did but mom didn\u2019t budge.   \n\n\nThat was a few months ago. As the date of the Quince\u00f1era neared SD came to me and asked if I would help her avoid the party. I agreed because I could tell she really didn\u2019t want this party. I asked her what she wanted to do instead. SD is a very big nature person. She likes hiking a lot. So we agreed that I\u2019d take her on a hiking trip instead of the party. We didn't tell her mom. SD just wasn't showing up. We told her multiple times SD never wanted a party but she decided to have one anyway. My husband told us he would go to the Quince\u00f1era to help handle things when people figured out SD wasn't coming.  \n\n\nToday I was supposed to take SD to the Quince\u00f1era. Instead I took her on the hiking trip she wanted and after that I took her to a friend's house so she could cut a cake to celebrate her 15th birthday with them. It was a great day.   \n\n\nOf course, SD's mom was not happy when she found out she planned a party with hundreds of guests only for the main focus of the party didn't show up. She kept calling us throughout the day but we ignored all the calls. My husband tried to keep her calm but of course she was angry. I knew it was going to be a shitshow when she confronted me but I was willing to face that.   \n\n\nLater today at home she came to confront me and my SD. She was furious. She was yelling at me, my SD and husband. After she finished her rant I told her to get the fuck off my property and that this was a lesson to pay attention to what her daughter wants. My SD politely asked her mom to leave. She got into her car and left with tears in her eyes.

Obviously, your SD's mother is TA for ignoring her SD's wishes when it was her birthday. I also don't think you should be blamed for doing something that your SD really wanted. It's her birthday - she gets to decide what she wants to do. The problem is here is you should have communicated to your SD's mom that there was just no way SD was going to a party she was unhappy with. Instead, you just took off without the main guest **without warning.** SD's mom may not win mother of the year anytime soon but she at least deserves to know where her daughter is, not to mention she spent all that time, effort and money to prepare for a party that's very important to their culture.", "NTA. Good parenting by you and dad/husband here. Mom wanted the party, not for SD's sake, but her own, and it was her self-absorbed moment that got ruined, whereas the actual birthday girl had a great time. I think this counts as \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\" When you don't listen, you can't blame people for not warning you.", "NTA. Though it would have been best to tell the mom about the plan, SD specifically asked not to more likely because her mom wouldn\u2019t have accepted it. There are people saying you have slapped the mom\u2019s culture but as a fellow Hispanic I don\u2019t see how forcing a girl to do something she doesn\u2019t want to is a good thing. Quince\u00f1eras, despite their cultural significance, are essentially lavish parties. Mom wanted to celebrate that more for herself than for her daughter. My sister doesn\u2019t want a quince\u00f1era because she too dislikes large parties due to noise and having to be the center of attention puts her into her shell. When my mom asked her if she wanted a quince\u00f1era she said she would like to go on a vacation. My mom does want pictures taken of my sister in a quince\u00f1era dress and my sister is fully on board as long as she can wear sneakers instead of heels and my mom was perfectly fine with that. The quince\u00f1era is ultimately to celebrate the girl coming of age, and what better way to do that than how they want it to be done. \n\nTLDR Quince\u00f1eras aren\u2019t for everyone and you can\u2019t force the birthday girl to partake in it against her will. Wizards of Waverly Place literally covered this subject once.", "You took her hiking. Beyond that this was 100% her dad\u2019s decision on what to do and how to handle. There is no reason for her mom to be mad at you if he managed this upfront. \n\nHe should have told the mom early in the planning process that SD would not be attending a Quince that she didn\u2019t want. Just matter of fact, repeating over and over that she wasn\u2019t going to be there. I don\u2019t think it was YOUR job to tell her. I love that you are close, but he should be the face to the mom and she can direct her complaints to him.  Otherwise the dynamic can get sideways fast. \n\nHe could have told any friends or family who asked about the upcoming party that \u201cSD and I aren\u2019t going to be there. She doesn\u2019t want a big party.\u201d  No further explanation needed.  Then no one can say they were surprised or ambushed or deceived.  Dad would not have even had to be there. He could have come along with you guys. The hike would have felt better knowing the mom and anyone who asked had been informed.\n\nI get that she was afraid her mom would make her life a living hell between telling her and the day of the party, but I worry she\u2019s learned to \u201cplay along and then ghost\u201d.  It feels easier but can be a bad habit to develop if you are introverted.\n\nIt\u2019s less insulting to the culture if you are open and transparent with everyone.", "ESH. The mom was obviously wrong to completely disregard her daughter\u2019s wishes and go ahead w the party she wanted. But other commenters are right about the quincea\u00f1era being culturally significant, not to mention that the party must have cost a ton of money. After trying to explain SD\u2019s pov a few times, I think stating outright that she would be with you during your husband\u2019s scheduled time and you\u2019d be celebrating privately (maybe even invite mom over for cake) would have been the best route. Leaving the drama to unfold during the party seems unnecessary and is where it leaves NTA territory for me.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour stepdaughters mom threw a party FOR HERSELF, not for SD.

When I was 15 I wanted my parents to use the money they saved for my party to be spent on a family holiday. My mother wasn't happy at first that I broke the tradition since she had planned the event for quite some time and imagined it as if it was her party, but we ended up having a nice time.

I want to root for you, I really do, for being the only person to listen ti this poor girl, but you needed to be more adult about it.\n\nLet me ask you this, if he divorces you over this, how big of an advocate can you really be in her life moving forward? This is absolutely something that would have me considering divorce.", "My husband agreed with our plan. I state in the post he went to the party in order to keep things calm there.", "Oh well if he knew then I\u2019m sorry, I still think it would feel to mom like you were erasing her culture, and I can get her frustration that her daughter wants to connect with being white over being Mexican, but I\u2019ll adjust my original judgement to NTA, simply because mom wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone,", "Did you and your husband fully explain to this child what the additional consequences of not telling ppl she wasn't coming might be?\n\nThere are so many potentially lifelong ramifications of this action that a child just doesn't understand. Apparently hundreds of ppl turned out to celebrate her, gave money towards the party, bought gifts, clothes to wear, accommodation and airfare if they traveled, maybe took time off work - some of the ppl may have even spent money they didn't have to celebrate her and she didn't show up. Worse, she planned for some time not to show up and didn't tell anyone to mitigate there loses. Thats going to shape how many of these ppl view her. It's one thing to not want a party and tell everyone you aren't going, it's another to pretend your coming, have ppl spend money, then not show up.", "No need to apologize. I'm a little confused when you talk about my SD wanting to connect with \"being white.\" She never mentioned anything like that. She just didn't want a big party like a Quince\u00f1era.", "I agree with this. OP is NTA because mom wouldn't budge and because SD's Dad was on board with this. I agree that OP should have had a conversation with SD about the cultural significance of the event - while making it clear she wouldn't force her to do anything or go anywhere - and that maybe she should have sent a text to Mom saying SD wasn't coming. On the whole, she's in NTA territory, especially since she acknowledges her ignorance of the cultural significance.", "No, you misunderstand, I\u2019m speaking from mothers perspective there. \n\nShe sees two white people removing her half Mexican daughter from an important cultural event. She\u2019s probably endured her fair share of racism, what\u2019s she going to think there? That her daughter is disassociating with her culture (which is important to her, the mom). She\u2019s going to see it as  her daughter being ashamed of being Mexican. I know it\u2019s hard for white peoples to conceive, but that hurts immigrant parents. \n\nI\u2019m not saying what your SD actually feels. I don\u2019t know her and can\u2019t speak to her. Only the perception mom probably has rn.", "INFO - is there a custody agreement in place?  If so, on whose day did the quince\u00f1era fall?", "So many people having such a hard time comprehending. Reading to understand is kicking y\u2019all ass. She was told numerous times HER DAUGHTER DID NOT read that again DID NOT want a party. She didn\u2019t listen she wanted to do what she wants. Good on OP for standing up for her step daughter. \n\nThe daughter\u2019s mom will be telling people she doesn\u2019t understand why she hasn\u2019t got a close relationship with her daughter knowing full well she doesn\u2019t listen. OP you\u2019re NTA. Keep being there for your step daughter. You\u2019re doing amazing sweetie", "ESH except the kid. Mom sucks for throwing a party more for herself than the kid. Yall suck for not telling mom that the kid wasnt coming. You couldve at least told her beforehand, there was going to be some fallout either way except now theres more", "ESH. You intentionally failed at communication, which makes you automatically an A. \n\nAlso, maybe mum wanted her to get out of her shell. A huge part, might not be the best Plan here, but it might have beem the case.", "NTA", "NTA- if the daughter doesn't want one she shouldn't be forced to.  When I was a kid my mom forced me to go to events I didn't want to go to because A. I wasn't really welcome and B. I often got made fun of and bullied.  If she doesn't want a party there's probably good reasons why.", "NTA, sucks to be the mom but if she were more open to compromise, I'll bet she could have still had the party, smaller, cheaper, and more to her daughter's taste. Instead, she got hoisted by her own petard.", "ESH. you should've just put your foot down with mom and insisted they listen to stepdaughter - and hoped for the best. Purposefully taking her away was a sure path to light everything on fire.", "YTA\n\nYeah, the party was always about more than just the step daughter\u2019s birthday and her personal wants. The whole obsession with selfish individualism is culturally contingent to the west and honestly arbitrary. The privileging of the individual to the collective is one way of life that isn\u2019t inherently better or worse than cultures that privilege familial and kinship bonds over individual wishes. You just assumed that you knew better and you\u2019re right because you have a different perspective. \n\nThe party was a big deal for the family. It isn\u2019t wrong to do things for other people. Like endure a party that had great cultural significance for your family and community. That\u2019s part of being a fucking adult. Instead you just taught her to disrespect her mother and her family because she just didn\u2019t want to go. You ruined something really important to a lot of people because you assumed you know better than their entire culture.", "ESH. Your stepdaughter could've at least said, \"I won't come,\" instead of \"I don't want a party\". I think that would've been fair.", "Im sure they had fun without SD at MOMs party. It wasnt planned for SD anyway", ">without warning\n\nOh look, another highly upvoted comment by an illiterate person.", "If he did tell her, it'd be a disaster", "Not only that but there was no consideration for the poor unsuspecting guests. The OPs approach was not the adult way to do things and makes her as bad as the mother.", "FYI put the Y T A like this, or your vote from this comment would count as you saying the OP is TA", "She told her multiple times before the party that they didn't want it", "She *was* warned.\nShe was warned when her daughter told her she didn't want the party to begin with.\nShe was warned when her child's father and step-mother stood up for the kid, and told her (what sounds like multiple times) that her daughter *did not want this party*.", "Did you even bother reading the story? Biomom was told over and over by them that SD didn't want a party. She refused to listen. This is all on her.", "I'm sure if the mom were open to compromise, there would have been, but authoritive parents don't usually do compromise.", "The stepmom WAS protecting her from her mom, I get that it feels bad, but I'd hope she'd try to understand what in her behavior might make them think she needed protection from her. I'd hope that you, as a mom, would have some introspection as to why your daughter might want to run away or avoid you in a similar case.", "If you as a mom would not impose upon your child something they vehemently did not want, by putting your own feelings above theirs, then you don't have to worry about anyone protecting them from you.\n\nDon't side with someone just because they are also a mother. Some mothers are bad ones, just as some fathers are bad ones. And some of both are good. If you feel threatened by a good stepmother protecting a child from a bad mother, I have to wonder if you're worried about how good of a mother you are and whether your child might seek protection from you.\n\nIf that's not you, you shouldn't find it threatening.", "Forcing your child to dress up in suffocating clothes and making them socialize with hundreds of people for hours against their will, will make them resent the parents and probably be a reason to cut contact with them in the future. A teenager has no interest in culture, they just want to be happy. The bio mom is making sure the daughter has a terrible birthday and the stepmom is making sure the daughter has a happy one by following her wishes. It's her birthday, not the family's.", "What a messed up take on this. Birthday parties are not about the whole family. Plus SD didn't care about the cultural importance and did not want the party. The only lesson learned here is that now SD knows atleast her stepmom cares about her when clearly her biomom doesn't listen.\n\nEdit: Unless all parties involved agree they're not about the whole family.", "Like that would help? Oh my god she told her plenty of time she doesn't want it, that's more than enough", "What if the daughter does not want to follow that part of her culture? Why should they force her?", "They didn't tell nothing to the mother, they told her that the daughter didn't want the Quincenera, repeatedly. That should have been the end of it. If the Quincenera is about the daughter, then why are the mother's feelings about it more important?", "Good parenting by you and dad/husband here. Mom wanted the party, not for SD's sake, but her own, and it was her self-absorbed moment that got ruined, whereas the actual birthday girl had a great time.", " I can relate to your daughter. Unless you want a quincea\u00f1era, that party will be just for the people invited rather than the quincea\u00f1era. When I was 15 I wanted my parents to use the money they saved for my party to be spent on a family holiday.", "It sounds like lots of talking happened and one person refused to listen.", "Boundary stomping ego trip is THE perfect summation.", "Then they should have told her straight up she shouldn\u2019t be there.\n\nI mean I am not letting biomom off the hook either.\n\nBut this can have repurcussions beyond the mom getting mad", "I get what you mean, but I guess I mean more like a compro-telling someone what the parameters would be. Like not skipping the whole party but the SD, parents, and stepmom putting boundaries on it. \"I know this means a lot to you mom, but I'm only going to stay for an hour for pictures bc it makes me feel xyz.\" Then dad steps in and backs her up or whatever is needed.", "You\u2019re so ignorant and immature.", "Because the party was never actually about SD, it was about what the biomom wanted.", "Or she would have kept the daughter under her supervision during the day and forced her to go to the party.", "Thing is, the mom was in charge of setting up the party, she could have just as easily said to herself, \"Hey, everyone keeps telling me this party is a bad idea, what if I ask my daughter what SHE wants for her Quincenera instead of what I want?\" She knew that her daughter didn't want the party, if she wanted to make her happy, why didn't she, as the parent, open that door?", "Aww you're so mad. And wrong. And mad about it. Have a good one!", ">Or she would have kept the daughter under her supervision during the day and forced her to go to the party.\n\nYea....hard no", "Ehh... it's a very important cultural thing. That's where the lines cross. It's highly about family and tradition. And tbh, not everyone is gonna open every door for you,  so you open your own doors, and in this instance, that should've been through making some compromise by the daughter and (probably) dad. Ppl make it hard to tell them what the boundaries are sure, but quinces are big and the mom's family was definitely looking forward to that tradition. Not showing up is a sit-down move... not very stand up. Although hard, people should be more stand up than that.", "That doesn't matter, that doesn't mattwe more than how the fuaguter feels about hee own damn birthday party. It's about her and celebrating her, it should never be done in a way that makes only their family members happy. She didnt want it, thats all that matters.", "I feel like if you mentioned the cultural importance of a quince in this argument, a clearer solution can be had. Its more than a bday party.", "Luckily we all know that the right way to bring children closer to their parents culture is by forcing them to do cultural practices against their will. /s\n\nThe mother is the only AH in this situation because she didnt give a single fuck about what her own daughter wants and feels. Parents who try to force their children into traditions like that end up in LC once the kiddos are adult."]}
