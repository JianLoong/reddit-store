My stepdaughter is half White-American and half Mexican-American. Her dad is White and her mom is Mexican. I\u2019ve known my stepdaughter since she was 3. Something to know about her is that she is very introverted and shy. She doesn\u2019t like massive crowds or loud music and especially hates big parties.  \n\n\nMy stepdaughter\u2019s mom began to plan a Quince\u00f1era for her a few months back. I\u2019ve always had a great relationship with my SD's mom so when she asked me to pitch in and help wherever I could I agreed.. I found it surprising SD agreed to have a Quince\u00f1era. When I asked her about it she told me she never agreed to one. She told her mom she didn\u2019t want one but her mom is going through with it anyway. She asked dad and me to talk to her mom on her behalf to change her mind. We did but mom didn\u2019t budge.   \n\n\nThat was a few months ago. As the date of the Quince\u00f1era neared SD came to me and asked if I would help her avoid the party. I agreed because I could tell she really didn\u2019t want this party. I asked her what she wanted to do instead. SD is a very big nature person. She likes hiking a lot. So we agreed that I\u2019d take her on a hiking trip instead of the party. We didn't tell her mom. SD just wasn't showing up. We told her multiple times SD never wanted a party but she decided to have one anyway. My husband told us he would go to the Quince\u00f1era to help handle things when people figured out SD wasn't coming.  \n\n\nToday I was supposed to take SD to the Quince\u00f1era. Instead I took her on the hiking trip she wanted and after that I took her to a friend's house so she could cut a cake to celebrate her 15th birthday with them. It was a great day.   \n\n\nOf course, SD's mom was not happy when she found out she planned a party with hundreds of guests only for the main focus of the party didn't show up. She kept calling us throughout the day but we ignored all the calls. My husband tried to keep her calm but of course she was angry. I knew it was going to be a shitshow when she confronted me but I was willing to face that.   \n\n\nLater today at home she came to confront me and my SD. She was furious. She was yelling at me, my SD and husband. After she finished her rant I told her to get the fuck off my property and that this was a lesson to pay attention to what her daughter wants. My SD politely asked her mom to leave. She got into her car and left with tears in her eyes.

Obviously, your SD's mother is TA for ignoring her SD's wishes when it was her birthday. I also don't think you should be blamed for doing something that your SD really wanted. It's her birthday - she gets to decide what she wants to do. The problem is here is you should have communicated to your SD's mom that there was just no way SD was going to a party she was unhappy with. Instead, you just took off without the main guest **without warning.** SD's mom may not win mother of the year anytime soon but she at least deserves to know where her daughter is, not to mention she spent all that time, effort and money to prepare for a party that's very important to their culture.", "NTA. Good parenting by you and dad/husband here. Mom wanted the party, not for SD's sake, but her own, and it was her self-absorbed moment that got ruined, whereas the actual birthday girl had a great time. I think this counts as \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes.\" When you don't listen, you can't blame people for not warning you.", "NTA. Though it would have been best to tell the mom about the plan, SD specifically asked not to more likely because her mom wouldn\u2019t have accepted it. There are people saying you have slapped the mom\u2019s culture but as a fellow Hispanic I don\u2019t see how forcing a girl to do something she doesn\u2019t want to is a good thing. Quince\u00f1eras, despite their cultural significance, are essentially lavish parties. Mom wanted to celebrate that more for herself than for her daughter. My sister doesn\u2019t want a quince\u00f1era because she too dislikes large parties due to noise and having to be the center of attention puts her into her shell. When my mom asked her if she wanted a quince\u00f1era she said she would like to go on a vacation. My mom does want pictures taken of my sister in a quince\u00f1era dress and my sister is fully on board as long as she can wear sneakers instead of heels and my mom was perfectly fine with that. The quince\u00f1era is ultimately to celebrate the girl coming of age, and what better way to do that than how they want it to be done. \n\nTLDR Quince\u00f1eras aren\u2019t for everyone and you can\u2019t force the birthday girl to partake in it against her will. Wizards of Waverly Place literally covered this subject once.", "You took her hiking. Beyond that this was 100% her dad\u2019s decision on what to do and how to handle. There is no reason for her mom to be mad at you if he managed this upfront. \n\nHe should have told the mom early in the planning process that SD would not be attending a Quince that she didn\u2019t want. Just matter of fact, repeating over and over that she wasn\u2019t going to be there. I don\u2019t think it was YOUR job to tell her. I love that you are close, but he should be the face to the mom and she can direct her complaints to him.  Otherwise the dynamic can get sideways fast. \n\nHe could have told any friends or family who asked about the upcoming party that \u201cSD and I aren\u2019t going to be there. She doesn\u2019t want a big party.\u201d  No further explanation needed.  Then no one can say they were surprised or ambushed or deceived.  Dad would not have even had to be there. He could have come along with you guys. The hike would have felt better knowing the mom and anyone who asked had been informed.\n\nI get that she was afraid her mom would make her life a living hell between telling her and the day of the party, but I worry she\u2019s learned to \u201cplay along and then ghost\u201d.  It feels easier but can be a bad habit to develop if you are introverted.\n\nIt\u2019s less insulting to the culture if you are open and transparent with everyone.", "ESH. The mom was obviously wrong to completely disregard her daughter\u2019s wishes and go ahead w the party she wanted. But other commenters are right about the quincea\u00f1era being culturally significant, not to mention that the party must have cost a ton of money. After trying to explain SD\u2019s pov a few times, I think stating outright that she would be with you during your husband\u2019s scheduled time and you\u2019d be celebrating privately (maybe even invite mom over for cake) would have been the best route. Leaving the drama to unfold during the party seems unnecessary and is where it leaves NTA territory for me.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour stepdaughters mom threw a party FOR HERSELF, not for SD.

When I was 15 I wanted my parents to use the money they saved for my party to be spent on a family holiday. My mother wasn't happy at first that I broke the tradition since she had planned the event for quite some time and imagined it as if it was her party, but we ended up having a nice time.

I want to root for you, I really do, for being the only person to listen ti this poor girl, but you needed to be more adult about it.\n\nLet me ask you this, if he divorces you over this, how big of an advocate can you really be in her life moving forward? This is absolutely something that would have me considering divorce.", "My husband agreed with our plan. I state in the post he went to the party in order to keep things calm there.", "Oh well if he knew then I\u2019m sorry, I still think it would feel to mom like you were erasing her culture, and I can get her frustration that her daughter wants to connect with being white over being Mexican, but I\u2019ll adjust my original judgement to NTA, simply because mom wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone,", "Did you and your husband fully explain to this child what the additional consequences of not telling ppl she wasn't coming might be?\n\nThere are so many potentially lifelong ramifications of this action that a child just doesn't understand. Apparently hundreds of ppl turned out to celebrate her, gave money towards the party, bought gifts, clothes to wear, accommodation and airfare if they traveled, maybe took time off work - some of the ppl may have even spent money they didn't have to celebrate her and she didn't show up. Worse, she planned for some time not to show up and didn't tell anyone to mitigate there loses. Thats going to shape how many of these ppl view her. It's one thing to not want a party and tell everyone you aren't going, it's another to pretend your coming, have ppl spend money, then not show up.", "No need to apologize. I'm a little confused when you talk about my SD wanting to connect with \"being white.\" She never mentioned anything like that. She just didn't want a big party like a Quince\u00f1era.", "I agree with this. OP is NTA because mom wouldn't budge and because SD's Dad was on board with this. I agree that OP should have had a conversation with SD about the cultural significance of the event - while making it clear she wouldn't force her to do anything or go anywhere - and that maybe she should have sent a text to Mom saying SD wasn't coming. On the whole, she's in NTA territory, especially since she acknowledges her ignorance of the cultural significance.", "No, you misunderstand, I\u2019m speaking from mothers perspective there. \n\nShe sees two white people removing her half Mexican daughter from an important cultural event. She\u2019s probably endured her fair share of racism, what\u2019s she going to think there? That her daughter is disassociating with her culture (which is important to her, the mom). She\u2019s going to see it as  her daughter being ashamed of being Mexican. I know it\u2019s hard for white peoples to conceive, but that hurts immigrant parents. \n\nI\u2019m not saying what your SD actually feels. I don\u2019t know her and can\u2019t speak to her. Only the perception mom probably has rn."]}
