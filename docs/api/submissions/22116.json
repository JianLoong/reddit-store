When you're an adult and have bills, sometimes you have to do what you have to do. Like, taking a job you don't want until you find something that you do.\n\nThat being said, if my partner had the *ability* to take on the bills and support me while I was trying to find a job, I would expect that. I think that's what partners do. Support each other. I'd request a deadline though. Something like, my temp job ends in August and I really only want to work in my field, so can you support us while I pursue that? ( a finite timeframe though, like 3 months, for example). Then after the timeframe I'd get any job while continuing to look. I think now through November should be plenty of time to find something. Perhaps she needs to broaden her search as well.", "NTA, only because she won't take a job outside her field, she can always take a job and look for her dream job at the same time. This being said, the job she \"takes\" may have lower wages, would you be willing to change the 50/50 in this case until she gets the better job?", "NTA.  If she was actually financially responsible she would have emergency fund saved up that can potentially covered her half of the cost until she gets a job that she wants.  Otherwise, her irresponsibility is not your fault. She needs to get any job to cover her half of the bills.", "NTA - It would be different if she had something lined up but it wasn't starting till October and she needed some help during the gap. Or if she lost her job unexpectedly and she needed a month or two to focus primarily on her job search. Those are times that you should be able to rely on your partner for help. But she has had months to plan for her current job ending. She has been looking for jobs, but she should have also been saving up in case there was a gap. \n\nIt is not totally unreasonable her to look to you for some financial help. But since you two are not married and don't share finances, that needs to be an ask - not an expectation.", "This post should be in the Relationship Advice subreddit, because you need advice on how to navigate this situation well.\n\nIt's not wrong to want your gf to take up a job to pay her bills. Your gf may have a point, as well - job search is painful, and it takes time and patience to find a suitable role. If it means that your partner takes on the burden of financial support for a short period of time, it might not be too much to ask if your relationship is otherwise solid and mutually supportive.\n\nHowever, just sitting around applying isn't enough. One needs to network, build some online thought leadership, and get part-time roles to get your foot through the door.\n\nNAH (assuming your gf is not lazy and parasitic). I think you both need to speak maturely and decide on a reasonable deadline, after which gf will broaden her search.", "NTA\n\nHer just expecting you to do so isn't reasonable on her part absent a conversation about it.\n\nYou and your partner should be willing to support each other, including in lean times where you or her might need a little help, and it's reasonable for her to expect support from her partner, be that emotional, financial, physical, or whatever else. However, what that support actually look likes, and how far it extends isn't something that can just be expected, because you are part of that equation and need to be afforded the opportunity to articulate what support you can reasonably provide.\n\nIn addition, in your situation you're supporting each other financially already. You pay half and so does she. She's not just asking for your financial support, she's asking for that because due to her situation she's not going to continue providing you the financial support she has in the past. That's incredibly inconsiderate of the support you need in the partnership as well.", "The only way I would cover her expenses would be with something like \"I will cover your expenses for x number of months.

This would be a different situation if she couldn\u2019t find a job altogether. She needs to take one to have some income until she can find one in the field she wants. She\u2019s currently working and job searching. She can continue to do that to find one in her field. It sounds to me like she kinda wants a break from work while she searches. That\u2019s not a bad thing as long as she puts her time into finding one and not relaxing.", "NTA - expecting your partner to pick up your bills because you feel certain jobs are beneath you isn't reasonable. She needs to grow up and get a job to pay her bills whether or not she feels it's the \"right\" job for her. \n\nI will say, if she DOES get a job and it temporarily isn't enough to cover 100% of her half, you should be understanding and try to pick up the difference if possible. But if she isn't working, that is not your responsibility.", "INFO - can you easily afford to help for a short amount of time? Does she have other ways to get help (like a nest egg or family with money)?\n\nYou\u2019ve lived together nearly two years so I assume were together longer? Part of long term committed relationships is sometimes helping the other person. The job market can be really wild and if it\u2019s just a month or two for her to find a better place I think most people would help out. It\u2019s different if she goes months without even trying or she\u2019s turning down good jobs for small reasons. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be an asshole for never helping but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t. \n\nIf she can\u2019t afford the money and just moves back with her family you\u2019re going to have to pay more than 50%.", "NTA, finances can be a HUGE reason as to why couples fight and eventually break up \n\nNot agreeing about finances is a huge indicator that you\u2019re not compatible as we live in a society where money is everything \n\nNot to rush in and be like break up with her, but if she refuses to be 50/50 and you refuse to cover more, resentment is going to build and break the foundation of y\u2019all\u2019s relationship", "Either she's capable of finding a job she's looking to career, either not and she has to take the responsibility of having found out any job. So in both case, she's taking the responsibility for her own choices.

Its already months of no success to could be longer for her to land the one she wants and she needs to pull her weight until then.\n\nShe is happily working a temp job now so not as though she is adverse to working out side her desired area.", "NTA. She'll freeload off of you if you let her. You are not crushing her dreams if she has to take a job she doesn't like for a while as she continues looking for one she does want.", "NTA \n\nMarried yes, but dating....no. Unless you come up with some ground rules like reciprocity... If something happens to you.\n\nPersonally tho, I've ditched partners for the 'I'm too good for anything but my unicorn job '.....

Like, if she was pregnant do you still expect her to pay 50/50? What if she got sick? Imo, these situations are adjacent to job loss.", "YTA. If she already has work experience in her field of career, that's where she would get the best offers for income and salary. Would you have her working as a barista while trying to apply for job as an engineer (examples)? Do you think the salary she would get from any temp short-term work would be able to cover the expenses she was covering when working in her field of profession?\n\nYou are being unsupportive and not thinking long term of what her continuing in her career field would mean for your household income. You are also short-sighted about what working in a field she is not interested in will do to her mental health, and what you pushing her to take any job would do to your relationship. You really thought only about your money.", "YTA.  She's right, you're being unsupportive.

I think its okay to support each other for a period of time while job hunting, going to school, being a SAHP etc. if affordable and agreed upon is ok.  However, relying on your partner while waiting to find the right job in your career and it taking months is something else and may not be acceptable if the partner doesn't agree to this.   \n\nThe way I look at it is what would she be doing if she didn't have a partner or parents etc. to rely on?  I guarantee she'd be taking about any job she could to pay bills/rent etc. while still looking for the right career job.  That's what MOST people do.  It could take months to years to find that ideal position.   I'm not sure where this trend of waiting for the right career job came from since it's usually is not realistic unless you have the money and support to do so and even then, most companies look down on having a gap of work history in the resume.", "NTA. If she lived alone she'd have to take a job she didn't want. Lots of people have to go back to retail or food service for periods in between more career-oriented jobs. The sooner she realizes this, the better.\n\nThat being said, if you were making like way more than her and it wasn't a big deal, maybe giving her a timeframe (i.e. a month after her current job ends or something) where you *could* pay a bit more might show that you are at least sympathetic to her situation. It's hard in this job market right now and it can be extremely stressful and upsetting to not even get responses for jobs you are qualified for. As her partner, you should want to support her and acknowledge her frustration while also maintaining a boundary.", "NTA.. You had a agreement and she need to keep her end of the agreement.", "NTA\n\nOP I'm sorry that you even feel the need to come on here and seek reassurance if You're an AH or not.\n\nIMO your partner is selfish and immature for that way of thinking. \n\nI was literally in the exact same scenario, I work in sales and I'm pretty successful. When I moved to a different part of the U.K, it was hard finding the type of job I specialize in, but I also had a son and wife to support, and a mortgage to pay...you know what I did? Took a job in a shitty call centre for a few months that was approximately 20% of the normal wage I receive, whilst STILL job searching and going for interviews. I'd wager many on this sub have also had to do similar at some stage in their lives.\n\nThe real concerning thing here, and the \"Elephant in the corner\" so to speak is your partners mentality and lack of respect for you in this.", "NTA. If you weren\u2019t living together, she\u2019d have to figure her own financial problems out and likely take any job just to make ends meet. Why should it be any different just because you live together? \n\nThings split based on income if one is a higher earner than the other is reasonable. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect the other person to carry the burden for both people just because their job search is unsuccessful in the field they want. \n\nSometimes you have to compromise and for her it means getting any job that will contribute even if not a job she wants to do or a job that pays what she expects. A job is better than no job. \n\nIf she\u2019s looking in a very niche area or you live in a place where her expertise is in low demand then she could be looking for some time. She can\u2019t expect you to carry the financial burden for an unknown amount of time. \n\nShe needs a back up plan so that she can continue contributing, even if you have to change the 50:50 split so that she contributes slightly less than you. A percentage split on your incomes is fair if there is a large disparity in your take home pay. This is fairer for you both and means you each have money left at the end of your pay checks to support yourselves, pay off debt or save and have some \u201cfree money\u201d without feeling resentment towards one another.", "Nta\n\nShe can put her expenses on debt if she isn't at least willing to do other work, but expects you to work instead.\n\nThis isn't a case of she needs to lean on you because she's ill or incapable, she just doesn't WANT to work other jobs.\n\nYou aren't married or financially dependent, she isn't raising your child.", "NTA. People in need should also help themselves. I'm guessing that you would be more than happy to help with any shortage she may experience as long as she is working to try to help. It isn't fair for her to treat you as a cash cow who pays because she won't leave her comfort zone.", "NTA  ... Personally I'm tired of people complaining they \"can't find work\" when they only apply for a limited role selection. You're an adult, you have financial responsibilities; just get a job, any income is better then no income. \n\nDoes it suck? Definitely.... BUT it's temporary until you find something that is more aligned with your goals, wants, and needs. \n\nI've been there frequently; but ANY income is better then NO income.", "Look there's a perspective for both sides here. Ultimately the question I have is do you see this being a forever relationship?\n\nMy partner and I are only not married because we're saving for a house. Been together 7 years, all the good stuff. I had a shitty experience with an employer a couple of years ago that he encouraged me to leave, and he also encouraged me the whole time I was not employed to hold out for the right thing. He was right, and I now have a shiny new permanent job in my field that even pays more than the old one. Equally, my partner is a contractor, and my stable salary allows him to push for more and good contracts that suit him rather than taking the first employment offer that comes up. In short, we're a team, and in bettering myself I've bettered OUR situation in the long term, so I agree with your gf. \n\nEqually, many commenters here have said that you don't want to get taken advantage of, and it's entirely right that everyone in a home should do their best to bring in an income, especially if your agreement was always 50%. When I was unemployed, I did some temping - bar work, like I did as a student; when my partner is between contracts he cooks and cleans and does DIY and fixes the garden and things like that because working directly with people is not his vibe. He's still contributing (I literally eat homemade cake every day in those periods)\n\nThis is the time to be a mature adult. Sit down and discuss your future, what you expect of one another in this difficult time, how much it would strain your individual or joint finances, and what your career / financial futures look like. Will you be the same if / when you're married? Will you maintain separate bank accounts forever? These moments will pop up over and over again in life, and you need to understand one another to make it work. NAH.", "Yes this is how by husband and I have always operated. \n\nBut I don't think I would expect this of someone I were dating but not married to or even engaged to. \n\nOP, I do agree that if you do decide to support her you need to make the offer time bound, and perhaps also look at making it a loan to be paid back over a period.", "If they were married I'd agree with the second part but if it's just a normal relationship I'd say no under any circumstances because that's how people get taken advantage of.", "As others have pointed out they are not married or engaged. In fact this relationship is only 2 years along. It's rather early to expect one partner to 100% carry the burden.", "After that time I will expect you to be contributing to your half of the bills and have a plan on place to repay me.", "She has some money in savings. While I can technically afford to do it, it would limit my ability to save and react to any unexpected expense.\n\nShes been looking for 3 months already but the type of jobs shes looking for can be quite rare", "The situations you described are not the same. She is refusing to apply to jobs just based on them not being in the field she wants to work in but she doesn't really have the luxury to be picky until she's already in a stable job", "I would rather her work as a barista while applying for jobs in her field than her be unemployed while applying for jobs in her field. \n\nThe difference isn't a random job or a job she wants, its unemployment or a random job and the salary for any job is more than being unemployed. \n\nI'm not asking her to stop in her field, I'm asking her to look for a job in the meantime so she isn't unemployed", "Look I'm a professional working at a tech company, if I lost my job I wouldn't expect my wife to carry the financial burden while I just do nothing and wait around. \n\nPersonally I'd rather be doing something even if it's temporary to bring some amount of money in instead of nothing. There is no mental health issue to taking a job for a few months while you het through the interview process for work that is more inline with your career. Heck if anything staying productive is better for your mental health.", "This answer is nuts. I literally saw a post a few days ago where the roles were reversed. The girl said the guy was in between jobs and got irritated that she had to pay the majority of the costs while he was looking, and almost all the people commented that she should put her foot down or dump him.  Not one person said what you are saying now.  Now let's get it straight, I don't mind people having a certain opinion but for God's sake can we try to be consistent at least?  These people are just dating. She could easily change her mind about the relationship after she gets her dream job and then you stuck with less savings or no savings or even a ton of debt.  IF you are married or engaged then the story changes a bit but not at the moment. It may be sinical, but it is what it is.  Not sure why it's okay for the girl to get support but when it's a man then sorry dude you are just dead weight and why are you not contributing 50\\\\50? \n\nWhatever, I am done with this conversation. I will write it off as reddit hypocrisy.", "I agree with your last points. If he decides on it being a loan, I'd put it in writing. Not sexy but have you ever seen Judge Judy? haha", "Eh, I can agree with you here.\n\nI'd probably be willing to do it though for a few months for my partner if we were in a serious, committed relationship and saw that they were really trying and not just being too picky or lazy. That's just me though (perhaps too giving and na\u00efve lol)", "OP DO NOT pay for her living expenses because if she is acting like that she will never continue looking for work. If you all were married I'd say something different but even then I'd say that she should still look for work.", "It\u2019s normal for professionals/people in professional fields to have to take 3-6 months to find a job. A job in her field will net her more money and happiness in the king (edit: long) run, and trying to get a new job while working full time is exhausting.\n\nYou really don\u2019t seem to care about her *at all* so again, I\u2019m saying if I was her I would rethink this. \n\nMy partner and I want the best for each other because we love each other and we know that\u2019s what\u2019s best for our future. Both of us have had periods where we supported the other while we found jobs in our field. That\u2019s normal relationship stuff.", "Would you be willing to pay a larger percentage of the expenses based on income? Like, if she gets a minimum wage retail or food service job, would you be willing to pay in relation to income? Or she would still be expected to pay 50% while you are making way more?", "She isn't doing nothing though and sitting around, she is applying for jobs. Looking for positions, preparing the CV/letters, sending them out is not somethign that you do for 5 minutes in the morning before you catch the bus to work. Not to mention if you actually are going to interviews, explaining to your temp job why you keep missing shifts or have to go out during worktime?", "Don't get me wrong I covered rent for a month on occasion when my no-wife didn't have as much business coming in but it was usually just a \"I'm getting paid on x date type of thing\".\n\nBut being married we both look at our finances and we have an expectation of what comes through the door and what goes out every month. We both have responsibility for those numbers and they are what they are.\n\nIn this case it sounds like OPs GF just wants to get out of her responsibility.", "She has already took 3 months and hasn't found anything. Why do you not think she should have to take a job in the meantime? \n\nSo if I decided I want a different job, I should quit my current one first and wait until I'm unemployed to look while expecting my partner to support me?", "It would depend on the actual gap in our incomes. Neither of us are earning a lot currently anyway so even if she was on minimum wage, she wouldn't see much of a reduction in her salary", "3 *to 6*. You can\u2019t just pretend the upper limit doesn\u2019t exist, lol.\n\nApplying for career jobs *is a full-time job*. Every resume needs to be tailored to the position.

Or \"I'm going to keep applying until the end of August and if I don't find something until then, I'll take a retail job\". She doesn't need to make a serious commitment to being a batista or a cashier, as soon as a better opportunity comes along, she can quit. But you can't afford to pay everything.", "I didn't pretend it didn't exist I just pointed out how long she's currently been looking. \n\nIt's not a full time job at all. So you're saying anyone with a full time job never has the time to look for a job? Just because you're bad at time management doesn't mean everyone else is. Millions of people manage to apply for jobs while already having one so stop acting like it's impossible.", "Three months is not a long time, it\u2019s generally the minimum.\n\nI gave you my judgement and while you\u2019re not an asshole you sound like an absolutely awful boyfriend.", "So I'm an awful boyfriend for expecting my partner to work?", "Take your judgement or I\u2019ll change mine.", "I was just curious how you think expecting your partner to work makes you a shitty boyfriend"]}
