We got along quickly. I realized that I had grown fond of her too and I enjoyed her company. I really liked being friends with her.\n\nThen 4 days ago stuff got complicated. I saw Anna use the n-word while telling a story to the other members of our friend group. (she is white like me).\n\nI was a bit bothered about this. Me and most of my friends are white and we never use that word, I mean, it is a racist slur.\nI did talk to my her about it but she didnt seem to understand. Anna said it wasnt wrong since she was just telling a story where someone else had said that word.\nI acknowledged that it might have just been an accident. But while talking about it, she said it again, on purpose. To piss me off maybe. This time I didn't stand for it.\n\nI waited for her to say something like \"That was stupid, I'm not going do that again\", but instead she just said that \"in her mind it isnt wrong to say the n-word\". At least not when there are no black people to hear her say it.\n\nI told her that I can't be friends with someone who takes pride in saying a racist slur. She did say she wasnt racist, but I can't be friends with a person who can't take responsibility for the stuff they say either (like, if the n-word was an accident, i thought she would at least take responsibility for the stuff she said by admitting shes wrong).\n\nAnna said that we should probably part ways cuz we have different opinions on the matter. I agreed.\n\nJust a few minutes later I logged in to habboon and our other mutual friends started to shame me. Apparently I had made Anna cry.\nI tried to explain to our mutual friends the situation. That Anna had made the choice. In Anna's eyes it was more important to be able to say the n-word and not get in trouble over it than to be friends with me.\nThey didn't see it that way. They said that I was playing the victim for no reason and that I should just make up with Anna.\nBut I don't think I'm playing the victim. It's just my preference to not be friends with people who say that word casually- even if they weren't racist. \nAnd, the thing is, I did try to make up with Anna. It was up to her and she decided not to herself.\nAnyway, after a long time of my friends gish gallopping me and telling me that I'm the one in the wrong, one of my friends told me that maybe I really shouldn't have friends. He said that I was whining for no reason and that I didn't consider Annas' feelings.\n\nI really don't know anymore if I am being the asshole or not. The three of them seem to think that I am.", "created_utc": 1669340382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z40hay/aita_for_refusing_to_make_up_with_my_friend_after/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may need a new group of friends, since they basically showed that they support racism and shamed you for not doing the same.", "Yeah, what? NTA here, guessing off your age she is an adult and absolutely should know why the N word is horrible to say. Otherwise, she\u2019s just blatantly being ignorant.\n\nedit :\nYour friend is also in the wrong for shaming you, it sounds like you need to find some new friends.", "NTA.\n\nWhat you permit, you promote.\n\nCalling out a racist is never wrong. Literally never.\n\nAnna might say she's not racist but she clearly is. Racists, much like homophobes, misogynists and other bigots never think they are one. They ALWAYS have some kind of internal dialogue that justifies their racism or whatever. The fact that she thought it was okay to use the word as long as POC weren't around to hear it is your big red flag that she's a racist.\n\nAs for the people you thought were friends, and I say this as a white woman, are what we call latent or covert racist. They support racism in subtle and less obvious ways, like guilt tripping someone calling out racism.\n\nYou were in a nest writhing with racism and didn't know until this one situation revealed it for what it was. Remember how birds of a feather flock together? You just distinguished yourself as not of their flock. Don't let them tear you down to their level.\n\nI'm sorry but you can't overlook racism just because you are being pressured by a group. Find a new place to play. You'll end up hating yourself if you tolerate racism just to maintain your own personal status quo.", "NTA. \n\nAnna is a racist. It\u2019s never wrong to refuse to be friends with a racist.", "NTA good for you for standing up for what is right.", "NTA\n\nLook, it isn\u2019t even about the word itself.  It\u2019s more like, if she thinks it\u2019s okay to just drop it like that, what else does she believe?  What else does she think is okay?\n\nYou are at an age where it\u2019s okay to just say, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work for me\u201d.  Your friends should be mature enough that they know they don\u2019t have to take sides.  They can continue to be friends with both of you.

You are not obligated to be everyone\u2019s friend.", "NTA I think a better question would be \u201cis this person wondering if they are an Ahole for using a racial slur and also ruining a friendship?\u201d \nIf the answer is no you don\u2019t think they are wondering that, then you have your answer.", "NTA, good for you.", "NTA. You dont need to consider the feelings of racists.", "NTA and if they see nothing wrong with it Ur entire group is racist stand Ur ground and get new friends", "NTA, I don't fuck with people who uses slurs, I don't want to be associated with someone like that. It doesn't matter if she thinks she's racist, she sounds racist and I'm going to look racist if I tolerate it.\n\nIt's not just word use here though. Anna sounds like an awful backstabber. You had an adult conversation with her where she's perfectly fine. She leaves to call foul play to all your friends behind your back, so you don't get a chance to defend yourself. \n\nWhat's worse is she's brand new to this group, you've been friends for a little while, yet they immediately take her side. You try to speak up and they don't even hear you out. They rather were told a different story, or don't care about her saying it. Eitherway, I wouldn't want to be friends with them. \n\nHopefully there's another party you can join for this game.", "NTA and good for you for speaking up and showing such maturity \nEveryone is raised different and exposed to different environments ,so a conversation and open mind can go a long way, but it sounds like she\u2019s not ready or worthy of a friend like you \nYou tried. \nI\u2019d be rid of the lot of them \nGood riddance .", "NTA. Anna helped you clean house, apparently. You don\u2019t need those friends. They suck.", "NTA. Good on you for standing up to people like that and for what is right. Most people wouldn\u2019t do the same, and that\u2019s a big part as to how casual racism is still allowed to be so prevalent.", "NTA.  She's doubled down on her racism and you don't deal with obstinate racists.  \n\nYou other friends also suck and if any of your other friends are in some minority group, like if they were Jewish, if they would be okay with using racism slurs if they weren't there, after all it's not like you were using it in front of them.", "Girl NTA\n\nNot at all. You slay, keep making racists cry from being called out.", "She would meet most people's criteria of what a racist is, regardless of however she's deluded herself.\n\nThe bigger point, though, is that she thinks it's more important to say the n-word that to be your friend. NTA.\n\nAnd your other \"friends\" suck too.", "If I want to bring across how fucked up something someone said was, I don't censor it in the retelling. Quoting a slur and using a slur to describe someone are two very differnet situations to me, and I have tons of friends who see that differently and I am fine with their opinions. They're wrong, and they take a good intention to the wrong place in my mind, but whatever you can't agree on everything. If someone wanted to quit their friendship with over this because they think quoting a slur is supporting racism, that would be their right to do.\n\nNTA.", "ESH (softly)\n\nContext matters - could they have said \u2018n-word\u2019 sure, and that would have been best. But it\u2019s not inherently racist to simply say a word. Furthermore, setting boundaries is completely fine - but to expect that everyone shares the same ones as you is presumptuous.\n\nYou started this journey with saying \u2018I don\u2019t like that you said this word\u2019 - great, boundary set. I do agree that if you didn\u2019t like the word, it was disrespectful for her to use it again. And this is where I start to take your side.\n\nAs to the point of not using the word ever - yeah, I can sympathise with that as well. Some people simply won\u2019t share this stance - depends on a couple of factors but the line for me is using it against someone or a group as an insult. To simply utter it - whatever, but it\u2019s in bad taste. \n\nI suppose the part that that makes you look like an asshole is the complete inability to associate with someone for one facet of their personality. I think we have a societal weakness where if we find anything we disagree with someone on, we simply vilify them or blacklist them. It\u2019s pathetic - you should always surround yourself with people with differing opinions and perspectives.\n\nEspecially so in this case where it was innocuously used (not against someone). \n\nHonestly it\u2019s so complex to explain this further in a single message. I could liken this to using inappropriate humour (some people say edgy things) that make them funny but many are flat out not accepting of this. Clearly there\u2019s a time and place for it - with a closed group of friends where trust is assumed - that\u2019s one of those places.", "I totally understand why EVERYONE should be upset when ever the n-word is used AS A RACIAL SLUR... not acceptable.\n\nBut I think people have lost their ever frickin mind going over-board with this \"cancel culture\" where the n-word being an ABSOULTE \"do not touch\" word... unless of course you're a particular race.\n\nCase-in-point was the recent news story about a kid that had a collage scholarship rescinded because  they found an online video of him singing a song... that just happened to have the n-word in it.  He wasn't saying the word TO anyone or trying to offend anyone... he was simply singing the words to a song he liked.\n\nIf the word is THAT BAD, then why is it acceptable for ANYONE to EVER say it regardless of race?\n\nBut like you, there are plenty of people who thinks this kind of \"cancel culture\" is just fine trying to judge in absolutes without looking at the context.\n\n{Let the down votes begin}", "YTA\n\nIt is not a magic word.
