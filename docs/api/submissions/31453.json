We have always had a strained relationship with his parents and family in general. They didn't like us being together in high school, thought we were too young.  Wanted him to \"play the field.\" (they have been together since high school) We ended up going to the same college,moved in together our sophomore year. They refused to pay for any of his college expenses (they had the means to, just used the excuse that they didn't like us living together so they wouldn't pay for anything, not) which was fine with us, both had jobs, but they have used money as a tool to manipulate us into coming to certain family events. Everything with them is transactional. Come to Christmas, get money. Call them enough times for their satisfaction, money.\n\nWhen we announced our engagement to them, they were not excited for us. Again thought we were too young, were upset that he didn't go to THEM for permission. No congrats was ever said. One night we had a discussion with them to talk through some of the issues in our relationship and his dad ended up getting in my face and screaming at me. That was the last straw for us  and we left and didn't talk to them for a while. Our wedding planning with them was not fun. They didn't agree that we didn't get married in a church, didn't think they should have to wear suits for an outdoor wedding as they thought it was too casual of a setting, the list goes on. \nThey've openly talked badly about me, making fun of me for being best friends with my mom, being quiet/shy which they seem as rude.they make fun of him regularly for his hobby of video games, telling him he should be doing more with his life and do activities outside of the house, like softball, like his brothers partake in even though that is not what brings him happiness. \nI could go on and on as to the issues we have had with them but I'll leave it at that.  \n\nIn addition to these issues, he had a childhood event within the family that they have refused to ever discuss or even acknowledge. He has been in therapy the last year and is finally starting to deal with and process these experiences and has slowly had less contact with them which has helped his mental health greatly. We've always gone to family holidays despite the toll this has had on him as he thinks it is his duty as their son to attend \n \nSo the issue at hand. Thanksgiving has always been at his parents house. We split the time between theirs and my parents. This year however,they have yet to mention any Thanksgiving plans. He has talked to both his mom and dad about other things in the last 2 weeks and yet neither of them have brought up Thanksgiving but have discussed Christmas. We think they are not bringing it up because they are petty and expecting him to ask what is going on. \n\nSo would we be the assholes for not mentioning coming over/just wishing them a happy Thanksgiving?", "created_utc": 1700599992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180r5ft/wibta_for_not_bringing_up_thanksgiving_plans_with/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm in the f#@k it phase of my life. If something is no longer bringing me joy or making me a better person, I'm over it. I cut out two very toxic people from my life a few years ago and it's been so much more peaceful. I am low contact with my dad and that has helped too. The world is going to hell in a handbasket so I do not understand why people choose to live in extra misery. \n\nIs there a reason why you have any contact with these people at all? Someone who yells in my face no longer gets access to me. Not to mention the trauma your husband has gone through and is still dealing with.", "YWNBTA in fact that's exactly how I would handle it. His parents sound very emotionally manipulative in that they think they can condition you to act a certain way and you are \"rewarded\" with money. The only way to make it stop is to not play the game. Act in the way that's makes the both of yoy happiest a healthiest.

As a child of a similar family situation to your husband, I understand the loyalty he feels to his parents despite how they act/treat you/him. They haven't brought it up, it's a power play. Don't play into it. Make plans being with people who love you and will treat you well. Don't go over there even if they bring it up at this point. \"It is a couple of days before, you already have plans, weren't aware they wanted to see you this year, we can see you another time, etc.\" Come up with what you will say if they say anything, and stick to it.

The only reason we have any contact is because my husband has been conditioned his whole life that family means everything and believe that because they gave him the basic necessities for life that he should forever be grateful. He's slowly getting out of this mindset thanks to therapy!", "A Redditor a few weeks back described it as living in a Circle of Peace - and I couldn\u2019t agree more. Nobody needs this fruitless tension of appeasing unreasonable people.", "You would not be TAH.  They aren't considerate and are very manipulative. You and your spouse a should do what makes you happy.\n\nI grew up with grandparents who used money to get their own way. The only way I got off that Carousel was by not accepting their \"gifts.\"", "It is very nice. There's enough to stress and worry about. I'm not about to add to it.", "I hope he can reset his conditioning soon and that you two will live a great life. He deserves it (and you do too).", " They believe they can mistreat him \" because they gave him the basic necessities for life\". Sure, his parents gave him a woman's egg and a man's sperm and 9 mons gestation. That does not justify repeated emotional abuse and toxic interactions with the both of you. Look upon the lack of contact about Thanksgiving as a gift from the horses...don't look it in the mouth, lol. Make whatever plans you wish to, be it with friends or your family or just staying home and relaxing. It will be the best holiday you've had in a long time!", "\"Circle of Peace.\" I like that and that's how it feels.", "Have your own holiday and you can call or text and wish them a Happy Thanksgiving in the afternoon. \n\nThey didn't issue an invitation, so you made other plans (rightly so!).\n\nEven if they called now, it would be too late, as you've already bought whatever you are planning to make.\n\nHave a fun, calm, and peaceful day!", "YWNBTA.... I'd make your own plans. They left it so late that you now can politely refuse because you made plans. If you invite someone to your dinner then it is impossible to cancel", "NTA. Plan your own Thanksgiving and Christmas", "NTA, you have been given the gift of silence, of being left out, take it, enjoy it.  Be thankful for it!  Spend the whole day with the people that make you happy.  Be somewhere, and with people that you are thankful, you know, celebrate in the spirit of the holiday!  Enjoy", "Oh same especially cutting people off\u2026am I bored out of my mind because of it\u2026maybe, but am I also more at peace?! Most definitely\u2026NTA OP cut them off", "Sorry that you have had to deal with things like this as well! It makes events that should be fun turn into stressful times where I'd rather just avoid them altogether", "Hahaha I like that answer. Thanks!", "Christmas has always been an even bigger ordeal than other holidays. They've never cared about other plans we may have. And it doesn't help that his brothers cater to them. I've always loved opening presents with my nieces at my parents Christmas morning and it turned into my entire family feeling like they had to be rushed in order to ensure we could get to my in-laws at a time they wanted us to. Finally last year my brother expressed his frustration with having to rush their morning, which is a huge deal because he doesn't rock the boat and usually just goes with the flow. That snapped something in me and my husband and I realized that we can't continue to treat holidays that way. Making them happy to make everyone else miserable. So we went on our time.  Going to do that again this year !"]}
