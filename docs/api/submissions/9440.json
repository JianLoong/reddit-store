OP's sister didn't give a shit about OP being family when she put OP in jeopardy of being fired and/or on the hook for paying her bill.", "It's crazy that you're suggesting OP pay out of pocket to make this go away. There is zero chance the sister will ever pay back OP, so your position is really for OP to just become a doormat bc calling the police on family is too \"unpalatable.\" I don't think it is right to expect OP to fix this for sister out of their own pocket, that just encourages sister to keep stealing from OP.", "\"It was absolutely a family matter\"\n\nThe family member stole professional services from OP.  That takes it beyond a \"family matter\".\n\n\"The police are not there for revenge.\"\n\nNo, police are there to rebuke and/or get reimbursement from thieves. Arrest if necessary.\n\n\"As an adult\"\n\nOnly \"children\" call the police? Adults do it all the time. \n\n\"reevaluated my relationship with her\"\n\nOP said they've never gotten along. To me, the key issue is can she deal with what the other family members are saying and doing. A lot depends on family history here. Bet sister has pulled stunts like this on other family members too. IMO getting sister pulled up by the police for theft in this case is a good thing, but I could take the heat. OP may or may not be able to.", ">It was absolutely a family matter\n\nNo, no it was not. The moment the sister checked in on the company's app and got her kid's hair cut on company property during company time it became a business transaction between a business and customer.", "I agree that calling the police was a bonehead move. But so would be planning to talk her into taking financial responsibility.", "So in your ideal world, who is paying for the extra time needed by the cops to resolve this situation? And why shouldn't the criminal have to pay for that cost out of pocket? Why should the rest of society have to cover it? \n\nIn your scenario, the criminal isn't even forced to pay the initial $24 charge! How is that fair to the cops, business owner, and OP?", "Supporting a system that tolerates crime does nothing but breed more crime. If there are no consequences why stop at $25? And honestly the bottom line is someone performed a service for a fee and someone stole that fee and time from them. \n\nIf you have an issue with police than argue for police reform, don\u2019t argue that crime is ok. And please remember when someone puts you on your ass and steals your wallet or purse, don\u2019t call the police and let them go.", "It matters that it\u2019s family - it\u2019s right there in the post - 2/3rds of her family are now against her. It\u2019s these kind of consequences that have to be considered. \n\nOP isn\u2019t the only one being saddled with it: I said sister is an AH, too. She\u2019s obviously a massively greater AH, but, in my opinion, OP sucks for getting the police involved.", "I disagree. In that moment, the most reasonable thing to do would have been to pay to satisfy her employer, and then to use influence as a family member to be reimbursed.\n\nShe\u2019s not going to the money back, but now she has 2/3rds of the family against her for getting the police involved, which doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least.\n\nHad she gone home, demanded the money back, made it clear to family members what had happened (that she was now out of pocket for cutting their hair) she\u2019d have likely got the support of her family, and a greater chance of being reimbursed whilst teaching sister a lesson.", "You\u2019re misunderstanding, but I\u2019m busy rn so I just want to say that getting the police involved is the nuclear option. It wasn\u2019t justified here and the family backlash was to be expected. \n\nOk, I would accept that OP is less of an AH and more *foolish* for involving the police. \n\nIs it with the hassle, the upset, or is not more sensible to eventually let it go, knowing that everyone is aware of what an AH sister is.", "But back in the real world where we\u2019re not robots and slaves to an inflexible system lacking in any agency or discretion, it was a family issue.", "I\u2019m glad you agree - but my point is that asking for reimbursement is the starting point. \n\nRemain proportionate and you\u2019ll always have the high ground, because in this case family support matters, and retaining the moral high ground would be to retain family support, which OP doesn\u2019t have because of calling the police. \n\nThe best way to teach sister a lesson would be for this to get out and the family to only think badly of the sister. But now it\u2019s overshadowed by police involvement for the majority of them.", ">It matters that it\u2019s family \n\nNot to OP's sister, obviously. Why should it matter to OP?\n\n>2/3rds of her family are now against her. \n\nBecause they too are probably thieving assholes. Thieves generally stick together on such things. \n\n>OP isn\u2019t the only one being saddled with it: I said sister is an AH, too.\n\nYou have not once used the \"it's family\" justification against OP's sister. You have only used it in reference as to how you believe OP's actions were unjustified. \n\n>OP sucks for getting the police involved.\n\nThe moment OP's stole from OP's place of business OP had an obligation to call the police and report the theft.", "You're giving the family too much credit. That only works in nice, supportive families, and this one doesn't read like that to me, at least not to OP. The family is likely to ask OP to just cover it bc the sister is broke and has 3 kids. OP would then always be expected to give money and help to the irresponsible sister, and family would always back up sister and not OP.", ">But back in the real world where we\u2019re not robots\n\nYep, which is even more confusing why OP's sister would do something like this. Only a robot would lack the emotional, moral, and situational awareness to do what she did  and think it wouldn't end with police at her door. \n\n> it was a family issue.\n\nNo, no it was not. Stealing from someone's employer regardless of your relationship to them outside the business is not, by any definition, a family matter. Once you involve a third party, in this case the business, any family privilege doesn't not exist.", "Maybe this is borne out of having family members who've tried to pull this kind of shit in the past, but when family robs family they do so using disregard for the moral high ground as their primary weapon.", "Because family tends to matter to most people.\n\nI\u2019m not going to make a leap and assume all her family are \u2018thieves\u2019 because an entitled AH sister assumed these haircuts would be free.\n\nI don\u2019t need to cover why sister is an AH: I\u2019ve said she\u2019s an AH, you agree with it, what more do you want?! She shouldn\u2019t have done it because she\u2019s family? Absolutely! Yes! Obviously! \n\nAnd no, OP, didn\u2019t have an obligation to call the police, legally or morally: she had the *option* of calling the police, and I\u2019ve spelt out why I don\u2019t think it was the right call.", "True, but most people do care, so I think it\u2019s reasonable that the sister would care what her family thinks given that she\u2019s garnered their support so quickly.\n\nAlso, coming from the OP\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s favourable to not have the majority of your family against you, so there would\u2019ve been that personal benefit.", ">Because family tends to matter to most people.\n\nIn this situation OP's sister made it clear family didn't matter most to her so OP treated them like any other thief.\n\n>I\u2019m not going to make a leap and assume all her family are \u2018thieves\u2019 because an entitled AH sister assumed these haircuts would be free.\n\nI mean, if they aren't thieves they are still assholes for supporting OP'e sister. The only real justification they have for taking OP's sister's side is they are thieves themselves and see nothing wrong with it. Otherwise they are just assholes not worth OP's time or energy.\n\n> don\u2019t need to cover why sister is an AH: I\u2019ve said she\u2019s an AH, you agree with it, what more do you want?!\n\nStop trying to pretend like family matters in this situation because if it did then OP's sister wouldn't have done what she did. \n\nStop trying to make the victim the problem. \n\n>And no, OP, didn\u2019t have an obligation to call the police,\n\nYes, OP did have an obligation to report the theft to the police if they wanted to keep their job. Someone steals from a business you report the theft to the police. There is not a business in existence that doesn't have this policy. Some let the value increase before reporting like Walmart but they still report it to the police. \n\n>and I\u2019ve spelt out why I don\u2019t think it was the right call.\n\nAnd you're objectively wrong on that."]}
