I\u2019ll try to elaborate:\n\nGetting the police involved in this is the nuclear option. It\u2019s a relatively trivial matter (for the police) and involving them has only served to cause many family members to turn against OP. That was a predictable reaction.\n\nI would expect a family member to be able to handle themselves in such a dispute *without* involving law enforcement.\n\nThe sister is *obviously* a complete AH, whilst OP is probably more foolish for calling the police unnecessarily (in my judgment: non-payment for haircuts from a family member is not a police issue despite it obviously *technically* being theft).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the right approach.", "Idk you have been previously doing it for free and didn't explicitly say this one was going to be charged for beforehand. \n\nCould go either way, I'd probably not have called the cops on a \"first offence\" so to speak... If you had said beforehand that this was paid for, or hadn't previously given free ones then it's a different story. \n\nSeems a bit OTT and maybe neither of you are the AH here, or both, but I'd have probably given her a bit of warning that the cops were going to show up as she's your sis.. and refused to do the hair again.", "NTA. But police are not a collection agency. If called, you need to follow up with charges. Drive offs on gas pumps are a prime example. A lot of them won't waste time tracking them done.

If the OP's sister had stolen from the salon unwittingly (had she, for example, believed that the cuts were free at the time she left the salon), there would have been the possibility that the issue could be resolved w/out outside intervention. Once the sister showed that neither the OP's status at her new job nor the rules of the salon itself meant enough to her to keep her from stealing, there was no good-faith presumption left & OP took her only remaining recourse, which was to enlist someone w/the power to compel her thieving sister to pay what she owed; by definition, this required escalation outside of the family.\n\nMore generally, it seems that pleas to keep things w/in the family are often just thinly veiled attempts to transfer the unpleasant consequences of bad behavior from the perpetrators of that behavior to the victims of it (in this case the OP). This designating of the victim's efforts to redress their victimhood effectively as an issue of \"family\" is a disingenuous reframing of the actual events to ensure that the victim maintains the status of a (presumably convenient) family scapegoat.", "I am *genuinely* confused about the cops saying there wasn\u2019t much they could do. Like: what the fuck is their actual job then? \n\nThese people came into your place of business, used your service and dashed without paying? Oh, you have their address?  Yeah that\u2019s sad but we can\u2019t really DO anything about it. What do you think our job is to stop people who are breaking the law?!", " NTA-\nYou could have lost your job if your employer thought you were complicit in the cut & dash - and the only way to prove you weren\u2019t complicit was to file the police report for theft.

If she refuses, what are you supposed to do? You can easily get fired for giving out free haircuts on company time, should you have risked that?

Like \"you're paying this time, but is it coz you're caught\", and they won't want the risk of you dishing out deals and cuts/time for free. \n\nThey'll simply fill your spot with someone who'll charge everyone as they should and not have this worry. \n\nThe only options were pulling the sister back in immediately to pay or calling cops.", "if they want to chip in to cover the costs, you'll take cash.", "Being an old man, I agree that you should listen to your elders!

Haircuts are $20. I tip $5 per haircut.\n\nOP is NTA. Her sister is very much the a-hole.", "The only option she had aside from dealing with the police was personally paying for the haircuts, and refusing service to her sister in the future. Personally, I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to do this and instead sending a message to the entire family that this is not okay.", "hahaha! Just what I was thinking but I would have her give her high sidewalls.", "I'm missing where sister was told *beforehand* at payment was required. The post says that OP told her to just come in when the app said to.\n\nI'd still go with NTA for assuming this, but if it wasn't stated that she'd be charged before she came, I can see how she might think she's getting free service like the rest of the family used to.", "People who are scapegoats in narcissistic families need the reassurance in the face of all the gaslighting.", "She already tried talking to her, and her sister\u2019s reaction was to leave without paying.", "Your profile says you're 9 years old...if true you're not even old enough to get a job much less comment on a theft situation at a job.", "Should be a given when coming to the salon she works for duh.\n\nThis wasn't off hours at her home or something like that.\n\nIf you work at a supermarket would you just hand out free stuff to your friends and family?", "OP wasn't goaded into calling - she was advised. and it was the right call.

So the best they could do was write a report so my boss could claim it with loss insurance.", "Agree.\n\nSister was also TA, though.

Ask Them!!!", "My brother works in Walmart, so I can take these groceries....\n\nMy sister works in this hardware store, it's only a few tools or supplies...\n\nYou only have to change the business and what's taken and it's theft very clearly, every time.", "The $3 tip is shitty just for taking up the time you could've gotten legit tips, even if somehow OP could've waved salon fees.", "Depending on the cost of the services etc it can be considered a civil case, at least in my state, I think anything under $500 is considered civil and anything over would be a felony which the cops still sometimes don\u2019t even do anything about \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "They can make a stern talking and a report.

It's like expecting your landscaper relative not to charge", "Yeah, the $3 tip was an insult, especially the shitty way she hovered over OP like she was waiting for her to screw up.

If i was in this situation i wouldve asked to be absolutely sure it would be free, and apologize profusely if i had it wrong. I also wouldve done so before the appointment obviously. All out of sheer paranoia for not being able to be hit with something unexpected, no matter how small.\n\nMy bet, is the sister didnt want haircuts from an ametuer. Then she figured since she passed her certification, shes good enough to cut kids hair so now maybe she can get a free last minute cut. Shed probably try the same with OP and cutting her hair once OP proved her experience was \"good enough\" to. \n\nShe sounds totally entitled and full of herself, even from the small post we read.

If it's at their home or mine I give them cash.
