She came in and she was so rude and just hovering over me the whole time almost like she was waiting got me to screw up. I was told there would be customers like this so as much as she was annoying me I just dealt with it. \n\nFinally after I was done with both kids she tried to give me $3 (yes three 1 dollar bills) I asked her what that was for she said it was my tip since the haircuts were free. I told actually the haircuts can\u2019t be free, I\u2019m doing this on store property in a middle of the rush I had to charge her. Without saying a word she grabbed her kids and walked out. \n\nA really nice lady who apparently was watching the whole thing said I needed to call the police.

It\u2019s your sister, you could have sorted out this disagreement as two adults without involving law enforcement.\n\nIf the company wanted to take action, that\u2019s on them, but for you take individual action wasn\u2019t a good idea and was obviously going to be received badly by the family and cause long lasting problems. \n\nShe\u2019s an AH for assuming it was free and then refusing to pay, but you also handled this wrongly, IMO.", "Idk you have been previously doing it for free and didn't explicitly say this one was going to be charged for beforehand. \n\nCould go either way, I'd probably not have called the cops on a \"first offence\" so to speak... If you had said beforehand that this was paid for, or hadn't previously given free ones then it's a different story. \n\nSeems a bit OTT and maybe neither of you are the AH here, or both, but I'd have probably given her a bit of warning that the cops were going to show up as she's your sis.. and refused to do the hair again.", "NTA. But police are not a collection agency. If called, you need to follow up with charges. Drive offs on gas pumps are a prime example. A lot of them won't waste time tracking them done.
