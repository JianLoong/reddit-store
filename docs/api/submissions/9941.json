Me and my wife share all our money and have a budget on a spreadsheet.  Anything extra we agree what to do with it together.  sometimes that means we just put some in the savings and split the rest for each of our spending accounts (we each have a paypal).  It isn't fair if you divy up all your income normally then once he finally gets some cash of his own he just gets to keep it all and blow it on whatever.  He should want to contribute.

If he gives you backlash tell him to imagine you decided every penny you earn you are just going to keep for yourself.  it wouldn't go over very well.

This is the first time he has gotten a large sum of money from streaming. I understand you wanting him to contribute some back into the household, yet I think your request for $50 for you to get your hair done for Valentine\u2019s Day is a bit much. I understand you have given freely to your husband for his needs/wants, yet you are telling him to give you money for what you want. He is not offering to treat you. \n\nI think you WBTA if you asked for the full $200. A good compromise would be $50 for your child or $100 for groceries. Not both. Though, I really think you should consider letting him keep the money he earned this time. This is a big deal to get such a large donation. \n\nIn the future, if this continues, yes, he should provide a portion of the funds to the house. You all need to talk about it though. Reddit can help give you a pulse check, yet only you and your husband can talk this out. Communication is key. Being the primarily income can be stressful, being a SAHP carries stress too. Talk it out without telling each other how to spend money. Come with facts, come with suggestions, come with compromises. Be flexible. Be kind.
