Me and my wife share all our money and have a budget on a spreadsheet.  Anything extra we agree what to do with it together.  sometimes that means we just put some in the savings and split the rest for each of our spending accounts (we each have a paypal).  It isn't fair if you divy up all your income normally then once he finally gets some cash of his own he just gets to keep it all and blow it on whatever.  He should want to contribute.

If he gives you backlash tell him to imagine you decided every penny you earn you are just going to keep for yourself.  it wouldn't go over very well.

This is the first time he has gotten a large sum of money from streaming. I understand you wanting him to contribute some back into the household, yet I think your request for $50 for you to get your hair done for Valentine\u2019s Day is a bit much. I understand you have given freely to your husband for his needs/wants, yet you are telling him to give you money for what you want. He is not offering to treat you. \n\nI think you WBTA if you asked for the full $200. A good compromise would be $50 for your child or $100 for groceries. Not both. Though, I really think you should consider letting him keep the money he earned this time. This is a big deal to get such a large donation. \n\nIn the future, if this continues, yes, he should provide a portion of the funds to the house. You all need to talk about it though. Reddit can help give you a pulse check, yet only you and your husband can talk this out. Communication is key. Being the primarily income can be stressful, being a SAHP carries stress too. Talk it out without telling each other how to spend money. Come with facts, come with suggestions, come with compromises. Be flexible. Be kind.

He has no excuse, but still acts the exact same way.\n\nAnd he's put my mother in $68,000 of credit card debt. Again. She makes $144k a year and can barely afford to eat, even now after two of her three kids have gone away to college/living on their own\u2014do you know how bad debt has to be to get to that level? On her income, we should've lived in a two-story home with a backyard, and yet I grew up sharing a bedroom with my two sisters and my grandmother in an apartment.\n\nThese are extreme examples. I am the product of a very late-stage abusive relationship between my parents. You and him can probably still work it out\u2014give him two or three small but useful tasks to complete daily, as part of a routine\u2014but you need to hold him to it and to be prepared for if he doesn't bother. Separate yourself financially\u2014it doesn't have to be in a big way, just even by the bank account method I proposed above.\n\nYou can do this. Hopefully, your relationship with him is not so extreme and upsetting as my parents' was. You seem like a really hard worker, and to be surviving on such low income as the only person even bringing in that income is an amazing feat, especially in this country. You can do it\u2014given time and a lot of communication, I bet you and him can work it out to create a happy home environment for your child.", "What does edgey mean?", "NTA Sounds like this should've been money that got saved/ split as family money with maybe a bit extra going to him. Maybe let it go this time with how you wanted it split as above but have a sit down convo that going forward if he makes money some of it should be going into the joint funds. Or have a rule that majority of extra money is your own extra money, like if you put in ot that is mostly yours and same goes for if he brings in some from steaming. Though I will say as well hope he's remembering about taxes.", ">All I ***asked*** was that I get 100$ for groceries $50 for me to get my hair done for valentines day and $50 to do something with our kid. That would leave him $500 to do whatever with.\n\nMaybe change your wording so people can understand that better.", ">OP. What does this man contribute?\n\nI think they meant if OP was a SAHM asking what they contribute would not have gone over as well. \n\nBut I don't want to put words in the other commenters mouth.", "If this was flipped the SAHM would be supported because it's a hard job and it's their money and you damn well know it.", "Can I have 12 cats is I say yes? \ud83e\udd23", "Thank you, I wish I'd had the back ground and education to make more money, I've been thinking of pursuing a tech field but I know it's oversaturerated", "It's basically slang for badass or cool but I think you knew that.", "I probably should, sorry I wrote this at work and was kinda rushing. I'll edit it", "But people ask that about women in this sub all the time lol? That's kinda my point.", "She clearly does want him to and the child is 7 and in school", "She says below that was the case when the kid was younger but is not true anymore, she'd love him to get a job.", "Yes, yes, I do. \ud83d\udc70\n\ud83d\ude02", "And when they do they rightfully get jumped on. Stay at home parents are working a full time job and then some. SAHM OR SAHD no difference. How much would this woman have to pay for daycare if her husband weren\u2019t staying home with the kids? And vice versa. You should check yourself. You\u2019re not as clever or righteous as you think.", "So you work all day and still come home to do the cooking, cleaning.", "What are you actually even asking me? I'm saying on this sub people ask women what they're contributing to relationships and households all the time. What's that got to with what I do at home?", "In other words, you bring it up and he refuses to change. That means this is who he is, take it or leave it.\n\nRepeat: HE WILL NOT CHANGE.\n\nThe only one in this situation you can force to change is yourself. And you need to ask yourself if you are willing to put up with this behavior for the rest of your life or not.", "AND HE CHEATED AND YOU SPECIFICALLY MADE A DEAL WITH HIM THAT HE WOULD SHOWER MORE? \n\nGirl. Do you want your kid to end up in a relationship like this? Cause all you're doing is modelling that this behaviour is okay from the both of you.", "So he's not even a SAHD? He's just a leech. He doesn't really clean or cook and won't get a job. What is even the point of him then?"]}
