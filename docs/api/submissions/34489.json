Every time my kids go back to their moms, she calls and texts me, infuriated. It all came to a head when I discussed going on a cruise with the kids, my wife, and the nanny over the summer because I have custody of them the entire summer.

Sometimes mothers have to bear the burden of discipline (and related hard talks) alone and that's not co-parenting. (\"Mommy means business and Daddy means fun\" type stuff).

First vacations, what about when she gets jealous that you and your current wife are able to provide them with a better home? Are you supposed to upgrade her living situation?\n\nAlso, how would you feel if your current wife brought her ex-husband and father of her children on vacation with the two of you? I mean maybe your wife is a saint and she wouldn't mind, but she shouldn't be put in that situation even if she would be willing to.", "I always invite my co-parent (and vice versa) on vacations/holidays, and I know the kids appreciate it. If you don\u2019t have an amicable relationship, you can still do couples therapy to improve collaboration and maybe consider asking her to invite a friend/family member who is good at helping her manage negative emotions when they appear.", "You sound as insane as the ex, sorry \ud83e\udd37.", "Just incase to tell you she might also want it to be a free vacation! You never know what\u2019s she thinking!", "However, I would make sure that it isn't solely during time when you have custody.", "Well, it is Reddit.", "The mom is already jealous of the nanny, I can't see her responding well to the kids having fun with stepmom.", "What business does your wife own?", "I coparent well with my ex and we wouldnt travel together like that. As we were separating, the therapist recommended we remain pleasant but avoid appearing too friendly in front of the kids. The rationale being that it's confusing for the kids. We both speak highly of each other, and there's no animosity, but we're not one big happy family. We're two small happy families.", "Then she hasn\u2019t earned the privilege to join you.", "I would not be inviting your ex wife on your family holidays with your new wife. No way. NTA. If I were your new wife there's NO WAY I'd tolerate having your ex come on our family holidays. There's times you have to spend together for the sake of the kids, like birthdays and school events etc, but no way should a family holiday include your ex. \n\nI would feel very uncomfortable and put out if you considered inviting her if I were your current wife. These holidays are times for YOU and YOUR WIFE, and your family. NOT your ex. \n\nUnfortunately your ex does need to accept that times are different, you're earning more wages than you used to back then, your wife's earnings also contribute to your family income which could be different to what it was like when you were with your ex, and also your life is different now with your new wife, and you shouldn't have to not do things with your family just because she can't do them with hers. If she's single that's going to make a difference in her income.e, but that's not your fault either. \n\nIt is also understandable though that your ex is jealous that your 1) able to afford big holidays now when you couldn't before, and 2) your kids love the nanny and won't stop talking about her. \n\nIt would be hard for any mother dealing with their kids loving another woman/ mother figure/ care giver. She's having to accept them being close to your new wife which is hard enough, but now also the nanny. Anyone can understand that's difficult to deal with, and she likely feels compared to them and like she can't live up to them as the kids rave about the time they spend with them, esp the nanny. \nI can also see she may be thinking you palm the kids off on the nanny instead of spending time all together when on holiday etc. I'm not saying you do this, you may have the nanny on holiday as an extra pair of hands with you, and are all together all the time, or she only takes the kids on her own for short periods to allow you two to go for dinner dates or something. But I would make sure you spend a lot of time with the kids on holiday. And if you do just have the nanny as mainly an extra pair of hands and you're all together most of the time, explain this to your ex so she knows you don't hand off the kids a lot. (I'm not saying you do this, but your ex might think you do etc.)  \n\nIn terms of trying to ease the situation with your ex wife I'd suggest a few things. \n\n1) tell her how much time you spend all together on holiday so she knows its not the nanny looking after them all the time. \n\n2) tell her she's a great mum, and nobody can take her place in her kids eyes. They see the nanny as like a fun aunty. She just supervises and plays with them and entertains them. She doesn't have to do all the jobs as a mum that she does, and obviously some of those jobs, like a father, is disapline and educating and setting boundaries, and homework, housework, and some of the non fun stuff. So obviously the kids are going to talk about the fun stuff they do with her. Being a mum is 24/7, and stressful, and full on. Being a nanny, she gets to go home after work and chill out or go out with friends etc. Nobody will ever replace her. \n\n3) praise her for the good she's doing. If the kids talk about her to you guys, or say something nice about mummy, or even that they miss her, text her and tell her what they've said, or let them call her or message her and tell her themselves. It's lovely if she feels thought of /missed/remembered/ complimented when they're not with her. \n\n4) talk to your kids about how it can be hard for mummy to hear about all the fun stuff with the nanny, and she sometimes feels a bit sad she misses out on some of those fun things, so they can hopefully be aware not to go over board with talking about those things or the nanny. They can still talk about them, but just maybe a bit lesser excitement lol and also be aware of thanking their mum for the fun stuff she does with them. It's about teaching them of being considerate of other people's feelings. Depending on their ages. \n\n5) If you have a lot more money now, and you're comfortably off, why not pay for your ex to take the kids to a theme park for the day or somewhere fun once in a while. That way you're not imposing your ex wife's company on your new wife, and you're still paying for your kids to have a day out, but your just paying for your ex as the person to take them and supervise them if she wouldn't be able to afford to pay for herself. It's kind of a middle ground. \n\n6) Also, just as a heads up, please don't impose your ex on your current wife when it's not needed, esp as your ex is bitter towards her. I had an ex once who had a baby and although I understood his ex would be around for special events, he offered to take her food shopping with us every weekend coz she didn't drive, (her parents could take her) and was going to allow her to come over for a few weekends to help clear up his garden ready for the baby's party, even though there were a few of us able to do it ourselves, and I was willing to hire a garden Strimmer to make it quicker and easier. He said he 'wanted to show the baby that her parents got along' but I didn't want to spend every weekend with her going food shopping, and spend our weekends for a few weeks clearing the garden. I just didn't want her around when it was meant to be our time to spend together. There's getting along and being respectful, and then there's overbearing and in your face all the time. You have a new relationship and marriage and your new wife needs to feel the priority. You can get along and be civil and share important milestones together if you get along, but doesn't need to be over the top. \n\nThere was a similar post recently on here about how an ex wife (they had a son together)  was always invited to family functions including the new partners birthday celebration, family get togethers, and the ex even booked the same holiday destination as them so she was going to go on holiday with them. Newer partner didn't like it but the guy didn't see a problem. Ruined the relationship. \n\nSo yeah, hopefully some of those pointers help anyway.", "Why is she bitter towards your wife?

And getting the kids to understand her feelings of missing out etc. And being aware of your new wife's feelings too.
