Ashley is setting you up for disappointment. It is rather excessive, especially considering they want no part of the planning process.

She can use her words.", "Info: If you\u2019ve been with her for years, why is it a surprise that she\u2019s like this? What happened on her other bdays?", "NTA. It's an unfair expectation. Some people really read way too much into things like this. Like, if you're not good at gift buying or surprise party planning then it must mean you don't care? They're an adult, they can use their words.\n\nPretty sure she's either angling for a big party or a trip away but she needs to be involved in some way otherwise it could just be a disaster for you both.", "NTA - this is so tedious.  Your partner is behaving like she's 7, not 37. You can do something really cool and that is a lot of fun without having it planned 3 months in advance. I mean I'm all for not leaving things until the last minute but unless the birthday plans are a vacation somewhere or dinner/drinks somewhere really exclusive, then shit doesn't need to be planned 3 months in advance.", "NTA but sounds like you've got a tough 3 months ahead. Don't fight about it though. It's a small issue. Unless you feel guilty about it you can just tell them it's a surprise and accommodate the planning into your schedule at your convenience.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to learn about that thing called communication...", "NTA - I also feel that people that have a countdown to their birthdays need to grow up. Parties are for little kids imo. A nice dinner with friends and family should be enough for adults. \n\nI know a girl that does a count down a couple months in advanced and if she doesn't get the gifts she wants, she will cry and hold a grudge. It's very cringe.", "NTA. \n\nJune is a long time away.  Unless you are like going on a trip or something, there is no reason there needs to be a plan made this early.", "NTA and also however many years together doesn't mean anything, my wife and I have been together nearly 20 years and I don't think either of us have ever planned anything that far ahead haha, too many variables to account for.", "NTA.

Is this her saying \"prove you love me\" type stuff?", "Holy hell how did your partner make it to 37 still acting like this?  Nta at all the entitlement on her part is ridiculous.  I don't plan my own child's birthday 3 months out", "NTA. A person who is 37 and still thinks dropping hints is an appropriate form of communication isn\u2019t a person worth being with.", "I feel like that conversation needs a hard shutdown. As an adult, if you want a big birthday party, you plan it yourself. I've done that for myself a few times.

Maybe it's because i'm tired myself right now but they sound quite exhausting.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk her what SHE has planned for YOUR birthday.", "I've only been with them for 2 birthdays, 1 they planned what we did, and last year they swore up and down that they wanted to do \"nothing\" and then got mad at me when nothing was planned.

And then the holiday is a good idea, but that would require notice for us both to take off of work. I feel pretty painted into a corner to be honest lol.", "I got secondary cringe off this!", "Not gonna lie, part of me does want to be petty and plan something like that I know they won't like since they're so stubborn about giving me any input about what they want. I won't actually do that though, as tempting as it is, because that would definitely make me TA. Lol.", "I usually avoid the word needy lol, but yes. They are very demanding. To them apparently this is standard and \"anyone\" would expect this, even though they are literally the only person i've met who does other than a toddler.", "She knows  a trip/vacation isn't on the table because A. I can't afford to fund that on my own, and B. We won't both be able to get off work around that time. So i'm not sure what she wants.", "I do love them but they are indeed exhausting. Feels like having a second full time job.", "LOL she won't plan a thing. Last year I planned/funded my own party and she didn't even buy me a gift.", "I honestly don\u2019t know how you put up with that level of drama. If they can\u2019t use their words, I don\u2019t see the point. \n\nThis might be more suited to r/relationships but have a frank discussion about expectations and how if you don\u2019t voice your expectations, you can\u2019t be surprised when they\u2019re not met. Life is not a romance movie. There is no script. \n\nOrrrrr you could go all out and plan something you think they\u2019ll love. Then when they act disappointed, fucking dump them.", "So now you know she is a liar. Good to know.", "If you're interested in a surprise party you could take her out for dinner and have everyone come to your house and hide while you're out, as long as you have someone you trust enough to let everyone in while you're gone.", "What's worse is she is nearly 40. Last year her best friend bought her some gifts and she was upset he didn't spend enough on her. Enjoy the cringe. \ud83e\udd23", "Yep, usually if they are like this in one area, they are like this in others. My ex would say he didn't want to do something on his birthday and then mope around all day if we did nothing as he asked.  He would make passive-aggressive remarks about what he wanted or wished he had (in many areas, not just his bday)instead of just being direct. It was exhausting and always made me doubt if I was doing \"enough\". I finally confronted him about this and he said we've been together so long, you should just know what I want. Like, huh? I asked him, \"So, I should be able to read your mind instead of you just telling me?\" He literally said Yes. Goodbye sir!", "Yeah, that's exactly how they are. I even asked for her to give a list of general ideas and I'd use that for inspiration so it would still be a \"surprise\" but that was a major no go and means \"I don't even know her\" apparently.", "NTA . Major Red flags IMO.  This is the classic desire of someone who is insecure, wanting everyone to know what they want/need without having to say it, as if doing it is less special once they ask.   The same idea as 'if you don't know why I'm mad, I'm not telling you. '   Tell your partner they need to grow up.", "i literally love my birthday, always do something fun, and always plan it myself with an appropriate amount of notice off and on until the day. people are busy with their own lives. i\u2019m also in my 30s and your partner is acting wildly childish. NTA, i hope y\u2019all can have an open and honest discussion about realistic expectations and how to appropriately celebrate a day about growing up", "NTA but do you really want to deal with that for the rest of your life?", "NTA. The age gap, the immaturity, everything is a red flag.", "NTA\n\nShe is 37 years old. 37. How is this childish nonsense about birthday hints age appropriate behavior? Please do not enable this. She can communicate clearly or expect the bare minimum.", "unless you're taking flights or something, there's no need to plan a birthday party 3 months in advance, it's a birthday party, not an effing wedding\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nGF is mighty demanding and entitled.  something to consider.", "NTA!\n\nTell \"Ashley\" that a surprise party is in the works and for her to continually ask about what's being planned would ruin the surprise. Act all mysterious if (or when) she badgers you for info. Then prepare your surprise. Good Luck!", "NTA. My man\u2019s birthday is in June and mine is in April. The ONLY reason we are talking about his birthday is bc we want to travel and that requires planning and saving. That\u2019s the only reasonable reason as to why any birthday needs to be planned that far ahead imo and especially not brought up as often\u2026 I have to work on my own birthday so it\u2019s not a big deal and it\u2019s not even been discussed. And it\u2019s a month away. She is creating chaos and contempt, for what reason idk.", "I 100% find this confusing.", "I guess that \"nothing\" was a manipulative and childish way to say that you should have planned everything, just like this time. Dealing with someone who constantly plays that kind of game sounds exhausting", "Partners are supposed to mean you share the load. Just sayin. It\u2019s supposed to be satisfying and fun to be in a relationship. It should not feel like a burden.", "Your relationship, your priorities, but what you wrote above sounds like a self wake up call.\n\nRelationships take work is true, but that doesn't mean they should be a perpetual burden.", "While it doesn't need to be McDonald's, simple cheap things are perfectly fine as long as you are being thoughtful.\n\nA day where they are the center should be appreciated by anyone. This can be a leisurely hike and picnic, a day in an art museum and street food, whatever fits their personality. Couples massages at a nice spa can be little more expensive but still accessible. \n\nPlanning a day or evening together shouldn't be this stressful. You should be happy to gift them something even if it is mostly your time and attention. \n\nIf they don't appreciate your thoughtfulness and time spent with you, it is time for you to start believing them when they show you who they are.", "I think that's all you need to know. Relationships go both ways. One can be more invested than the other in gifts/planning, but doing nothing while expecting constant attention and unreasonable gifts is not healthy.", "You deserve to be appreciated, taken care of, and respected.\n\nFull stop.\n\nAlso, I'm 39 and my partner is 28. Your partner's behavior sounds selfish at any age but it is breaking my heart that someone who is my age is acting like this to their younger partner. I treasure my girlfriend and worry about inconveniencing her in any way...not to say I'm perfect (not at all, lol), but there is a lot of growing from late 20s to late 30s and all I want to do is support her in that and make her life easier.\n\nI hope that whatever happens for you next in this relationship is a positive step forward, no matter what it may be. And that your next birthday is fabulous! \ud83d\udc9c", "I wouldn't wait for her birthday, I'd just end the relationship now.", "This is actually a really good idea, thankyou!", "Yes yes.   \nI was in a similar situation with someone who said they hated such holiday and wanted to do nothing on it, but still wanted me to read between the line and know that what they were telling was different than what they were expecting.   \nFor *years* I bent over backwards trying to please them and breaking news: it is impossible because the expectation itself is a fucking paradox.  \n\nGetting rid of the guilt they instill is very difficult but I finally stopped trying to please them: you say you don\u2019t want to do something on this day? Fine I\u2019ll make plans for myself. It is freeing. Not easy, but worth it.\n\nNTA, OP, you can\u2019t read minds and shouldn\u2019t be expected to, you need to communicate with your partner about their unreasonable expectations because it\u2019s very unhealthy and unfair to you.", "Dudley Dursley entered the chat.", "Thankyou <3 I really appreciate that", "Ugh, I feel for you man. Like I said, exhausting. I get someone wanting to receive a thoughtful gift from their partner that shows you listen and know them well. But it also should be okay to ask for a little guidance about an event they want you to plan (especially if they are picky and a bit dramatic lol)", "Info:  What's your partner done for you on your birthdays?", "NTA.   High maintenance people are the worst, good luck in the future dude, your life is gonna be a nightmare.", "NTA She is setting you up to fail. You are in a no win situation and is playing games with you. She either communicates like a grown up, or the relationship is doomed to fail.", "OFFS. NTA! She's an entitled, self-centered brat. I'm sorry, but I simply can't understand grown adults being so focused on birthdays, unless it's their 21st or one that ends in a 0, and even then, why can't they plan their own celebration, invite friends, and state \"No gifts required\"? I'm turning 70 in a year and a half, and have already informally sent a \"save the date\" for a few close friends to join me at a tacky but fun Tiki bar restaurant for a dinner which \\*I\\* will pay for.", "NTA\n\nMy birthday is at the end of June. I haven't even begun to think about it. I haven't asked my spouse about it. I'm judging someone hard who's 37 and acting like a 10yo who wants/expects to be taken to Disney for their bday.\n\nIf your SO is like this on birthdays, is she also exhausting with other holidays that could involve presents?\n\nEdited to add judgement.", "Don't get me wrong, if you've being with her for an extended period of time, I would be spiteful if you asked me what I wanted to do too. You really *should* know what to do and have a plan. That's not totally unfair.\n\nHowever, 3 months in advance? That's rather excessive... She's doing too much.\n\nNTA", "how long have you been together? is she looking for a proposal?", "I can respect your love, but why are you with someone who's going to treat you like this for as long as they're around? NTA.", "NTA\n\nAre you dating your boss?", "NTA - my third grader is the same, so I guess there's that.  We have a rule that you aren't allowed to start planning your birthday until the month before.  We mark it on the calendar, and I find stickers really help with behaviour reinforcement.\n\n\nIn all seriousness though, three months is excessive and it's completely sensible to ask what they would like to do. From the sounds of it you're going to have a really hard time getting it right.  Definitely sounds like they want a trip or big party though.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s mothers day in 2 days (I live in the uk) and haven\u2019t even bothered to ask my partner what his plans are, I now feel like I am 3 months too late.", "Holy mackerel. NTA. She's a piece of work, though.\n\nShe's setting you up for extra drama. She's an adult - she can use her words. And as you said, she's \"extra boujee and picky\". If she's that picky, let her know that hints won't work - she needs to tell you loud and clear. Because it seems the thoughtfulness isn't making a difference in the birthdays \n\nOr, and this is what my advice is - RUN.", "NTA my two kids and husband all have birthdays in June haven\u2019t even thought about planning for any of them yet. If their birthday means that much to them then they can plan/pay for their own party the same way that you had to do for yourself just last year.", "Ashley's playing games with OP.  If this were a landmark birthday, such as 40, then plan it in advance and plan it TOGETHER so everyone is on the same page about what the birthday girl wants.  But, three months in advance for a 38th birthday, and saying \"I've been dropping hints\"?  Hell naw.  Ashley needs to knock it off with the games and clearly communicate with OP what she wants to do, so OP can plan for a celebration that Ashley will be happy with.", "Hoo boy, she sounds exhausting.

I think that says all you need to about her priorities in this relationship, my dude. \ud83d\ude1e", "And yet, from your other comments, she knows you don't. I say you turn this around on her. She says anyone would expect this for their birthday. So.... do it. Ask her what she's got planned for YOUR birthday. Doesn't matter how far it is. Raise a stink when she has nothing planned.

She was very happy and appreciative, so it was big success.  My birthday rolled around two months later, and I got an aquarium rock for my fish tank .\n\nHaving high expectations for a partner is fine, as long as it works both ways.", "No- they will not be able to take off work at that time. I've already asked them. That's the busiest season at their work, and they also have tickets to an event that falls on the day prior to their birthday as well. Not pretending, they're being confusing.", "But if someone wants to go on a vacation, that should take two to plan/agree on no? So many things can go wrong if i'm expected to plan a vacation all on my own with zero input from her. I don't think thats unreasonable.
