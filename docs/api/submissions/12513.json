Things have been tense. \n\nI feel like I need to add that, they are VERY picky. Very boujee, high standards, which is fine.

Ashley is setting you up for disappointment. It is rather excessive, especially considering they want no part of the planning process. This simply isn't everyone's forte and that's fine. \n\nI will say though, based on the lead time I'm guessing they want a holiday/mini break.", "NTA. She can use her words.", "Info: If you\u2019ve been with her for years, why is it a surprise that she\u2019s like this? What happened on her other bdays?", "NTA. It's an unfair expectation. Some people really read way too much into things like this. Like, if you're not good at gift buying or surprise party planning then it must mean you don't care? They're an adult, they can use their words.\n\nPretty sure she's either angling for a big party or a trip away but she needs to be involved in some way otherwise it could just be a disaster for you both.", "NTA - this is so tedious.  Your partner is behaving like she's 7, not 37. You can do something really cool and that is a lot of fun without having it planned 3 months in advance. I mean I'm all for not leaving things until the last minute but unless the birthday plans are a vacation somewhere or dinner/drinks somewhere really exclusive, then shit doesn't need to be planned 3 months in advance.", "NTA but sounds like you've got a tough 3 months ahead. Don't fight about it though. It's a small issue. Unless you feel guilty about it you can just tell them it's a surprise and accommodate the planning into your schedule at your convenience.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to learn about that thing called communication...", "NTA - I also feel that people that have a countdown to their birthdays need to grow up. Parties are for little kids imo. A nice dinner with friends and family should be enough for adults. \n\nI know a girl that does a count down a couple months in advanced and if she doesn't get the gifts she wants, she will cry and hold a grudge. It's very cringe.", "NTA. \n\nJune is a long time away.  Unless you are like going on a trip or something, there is no reason there needs to be a plan made this early.", "NTA and also however many years together doesn't mean anything, my wife and I have been together nearly 20 years and I don't think either of us have ever planned anything that far ahead haha, too many variables to account for.", "NTA.

I can't stand adults that act like that about their birthday.", "NTA\n\nI know some adults who consider their birthday a national holiday, and I don't understand.\n\nIs she generally needy?  Is this her saying \"prove you love me\" type stuff?", "Holy hell how did your partner make it to 37 still acting like this?  Nta at all the entitlement on her part is ridiculous.  I don't plan my own child's birthday 3 months out", "NTA. A person who is 37 and still thinks dropping hints is an appropriate form of communication isn\u2019t a person worth being with.", "I feel like that conversation needs a hard shutdown. As an adult, if you want a big birthday party, you plan it yourself. I've done that for myself a few times. I couldn't imagine being so entitled to think someone else should have done that for me. \n\n\"If it's important to you that it's planned this far in advance, go ahead and plan it. I'll be getting you a nice gift as usual, but I will not be planning this party.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA but she is telling you to plan a trip for her birthday which is why she wants to see a hint that this is on your mind so you can't just go 'oh I would have planned something neat but now tix are expens.' it's not that confusing", "NTA - After reading your comments, how about planing a nice breakup for their birthday? Maybe it's because i'm tired myself right now but they sound quite exhausting.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk her what SHE has planned for YOUR birthday.", "I've only been with them for 2 birthdays, 1 they planned what we did, and last year they swore up and down that they wanted to do \"nothing\" and then got mad at me when nothing was planned. I always get them really thoughtful gifts though.", "I'd love to do a surprise party for them but they work from home so they are there basically 24/7. And then the holiday is a good idea, but that would require notice for us both to take off of work. I feel pretty painted into a corner to be honest lol.", "I got secondary cringe off this!", "Not gonna lie, part of me does want to be petty and plan something like that I know they won't like since they're so stubborn about giving me any input about what they want. I won't actually do that though, as tempting as it is, because that would definitely make me TA. Lol.", "I usually avoid the word needy lol, but yes. They are very demanding. To them apparently this is standard and \"anyone\" would expect this, even though they are literally the only person i've met who does other than a toddler.", "She knows  a trip/vacation isn't on the table because A. I can't afford to fund that on my own, and B. We won't both be able to get off work around that time. So i'm not sure what she wants.", "I do love them but they are indeed exhausting. Feels like having a second full time job.", "LOL she won't plan a thing. Last year I planned/funded my own party and she didn't even buy me a gift.", "I honestly don\u2019t know how you put up with that level of drama. If they can\u2019t use their words, I don\u2019t see the point. \n\nThis might be more suited to r/relationships but have a frank discussion about expectations and how if you don\u2019t voice your expectations, you can\u2019t be surprised when they\u2019re not met. Life is not a romance movie. There is no script. \n\nOrrrrr you could go all out and plan something you think they\u2019ll love. Then when they act disappointed, fucking dump them.", "So now you know she is a liar. Good to know.", "If you're interested in a surprise party you could take her out for dinner and have everyone come to your house and hide while you're out, as long as you have someone you trust enough to let everyone in while you're gone.", "What's worse is she is nearly 40. Last year her best friend bought her some gifts and she was upset he didn't spend enough on her. Enjoy the cringe. \ud83e\udd23", "Yep, usually if they are like this in one area, they are like this in others. My ex would say he didn't want to do something on his birthday and then mope around all day if we did nothing as he asked.  He would make passive-aggressive remarks about what he wanted or wished he had (in many areas, not just his bday)instead of just being direct. It was exhausting and always made me doubt if I was doing \"enough\". I finally confronted him about this and he said we've been together so long, you should just know what I want. Like, huh? I asked him, \"So, I should be able to read your mind instead of you just telling me?\" He literally said Yes. Goodbye sir!", "Yeah, that's exactly how they are. I even asked for her to give a list of general ideas and I'd use that for inspiration so it would still be a \"surprise\" but that was a major no go and means \"I don't even know her\" apparently."]}
