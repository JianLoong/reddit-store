After I finished feeding the baby and he was out of his game he then asks if I need help. I snapped back at him because I was so annoyed and he acted so offended and like I shouldn't be annoyed.

One less baby to worry about.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd just for the record: You should wait 12 month with getting pregnant after a C-section. You first (27months) minus pregnancy (9months) means, that you got pregnant after 2!!! month with your second baby. I wasn't even enjoying sex at that time after my first c-section. \n\nSame with the third one. 16 minus the 9 month.. Slightly better, but i would guess, that your gyno did tell you to wait AT LEAST a year after \" c-sections.\n\nSounds like your partner doesn't care about your kids well being or your well being or health. He sounds like he doesn't care at all. I'm really sorry for saying this... But do you really think you are better off with him than without him? I bet he is already wanting to be intimate again, after years of doing nothing and even after seeing you struggle.", "For everyone judging op over the number of kids while unemployed, chill out, she literally did not ask for judgement there and has not mentioned struggling financially. The dangers with multiple c sections absolutely need pointing out but the rest is not needed. \n\nNta, but seriously you need to address the token parenting going on here. By my count you haven't had a good night's sleep in years and are second guessing whether being annoyed your partner isn't pulling his weight is ok or not. Your feelings are very much valid. You should be annoyed and it is time to get a discussion started on sharing the work evenly or your partner moving on so you've only 3 kids instead of 4. Its hard but you'll break if you keep going and you're no good to your babies then. Self care is vital in the early years and, if your partner won't step up, its time to find help elsewhere. Family is usually a great place to start.", "NTA\n\n> I don't see how he can nap, play games, scroll through his phone all day and still apparently do everything.\n\nBecause he isn\u2019t. \n\nHe either truely believes he is doing everything, which is still bad because he\u2019s being willfully blind to an exhausted partner - but maybe doing a chart for a week of who does what (and how long it takes) might help; or he\u2019s lying because it\u2019s easier to act like you are being unreasonable so he can do what he wants while you taje on the bulk of the responsibility.\n\nThere is also the issue of being unemployed - if he\u2019s off to help you, he needs to do that - if he\u2019s consistently unemployed, you have an entirely different issue.\n\nAnd please speak to your ob/gyn about birth control, your body needs a break from having babies so you can heal.", "NTA.  By the way, you have four kids to look after.", "NTA and any reasonable adult would agree. I like to play games when I can and if I feel like it, but when my kids were babies I would always do what I could to \"take my turn\", even when I was working while my GF was on maternity leave. I remember when my youngest was that small, I worked nights usually 4 on 3 off. On my first night of the week off I would take her to the living room and set her up a comfy bed on the sofa, I would nap, game, watch a movie or something and tend to her if she needed anything. She often just slept a solid 12 hours ( amazing after our first who woke every 3 hours to feed lol ) and I'd dream feed her a bottle and change her wet nappy. I know this gave my girlfriend a much needed break as even if my Daughter would sleep 12 hours solid, my GF would just sleep lightly knowing she's there and has to tend to her. Honestly I enjoyed those nights, they're precious memories. Your partner is missing out.", "NTA your body is healing you need more rest he's not working and basically living like a teenager gaming all day n night while your doing all the work.

Don't just show him what a bunch of nobodies on Reddit think. Tell him that you feel the chores are uneven and try to find a solution together.", "NTA - it is never OK to wake up your partner so that you can continue to play a computer game.

Grow the f*** up and take responsibility.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like you have 4 kids though.", "NTA. If that was me I would have snapped his finger.

OP, you need to get on some birth control and figure out a way to ditch your LOSER partner. If you stay with him, there will be no winning.
