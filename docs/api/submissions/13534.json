Like you either accept him or not saying they dislike him because he doesn\u2019t conform to typical gender norms is not acceptance", "Of course NTA, your parents sure as hell are assholes though. You did the right thing by calling them out. Even without the details of your brother being gay, your family's views on it, and their \"reasoning\" they are still the assholes.\n\nI can't imagine any scenario where it would be okay to go behind your child's back and invite their ex over for dinner. The added details you provided make the situation even worse.", "\"Boys being boys\" is the rhetoric that's enables a system that sweeps domestic abuse under the rug.

You need to tell your younger brothers how Tyler treated your brother, he may end up trying to abuse one of them too.", "Nta- and great job standing up for your brother.  Your parents want to control over him and they place as his parents. Good on you to have your brothers back and saying something otherwise this will become an issue in the future if they continue this behavior.", "It sounds like your parents are abusive and transphobic/homophobic. You should go no contact immediately and take your brothers with you. Bigots don't deserve a family.", "NTA, I guess to your parents, domestic violence is just \"boys being boys\". Good to know for all their kids' future partners.", "\u201cDear extended family, if you think my brother Carver should have remained in an abusive relationship rather than be with someone who respects him and makes him happy, then I have nothing more to say to you, because I love my brother and want the best for him.\u201d\n\nAaaaand NC.\n\nNTA.
