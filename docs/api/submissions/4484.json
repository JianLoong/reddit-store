Your parents are sexist and are unlikely to change now. Your brother may actually be the unlucky one because he hasn't been parented very well. It may take him longer to grow up.  A useful consideration for you might be that your parents will reap what they have sown. They've created a bad relationship with you and an indulgent one with their son.  Feel free to distance yourself from them and create your own adult life.", "NTA, your parents, both, seem very sexist. They tried to prevent you from living your teenage years, while not doing the same for young brother. Chances are, it's because you're a woman. They either have that mentality where you \"raise your daughter with watchful eyes and your son set loose\" or they just always wanted a boy and spent his life spoiling him for that reason. In both cases, it's sexism.", "NTA, but I doubt they will change.  Make it clear to your parents if they are old or sick and need help, they will need to call \"golden boy\"", "NTA", "NTA. It seems very misogynistic to be so strict with you, but otherwise excuse and enable your brother.\n\nUnfortunately, doesn't seem like an argument you're likely to change them on.", "NTA but don\u2019t expect things to change. My parents have taken my siblings to trips to other countries, bought them cars and I haven\u2019t received any of it. It sucks, and I\u2019m proud of you for calling them out, but they won\u2019t change, going lc and accepting that helped me mentally get over it.", "NTA.\n\nI grew up similarly as the only daughter\u2014my two brothers got to do whatever the hell they wanted and always got preferential treatment. They got to pursue their sport of choice till college, but I wasn't able to continue swimming classes past the first year because my parents couldn't afford it as they were spending all their money on my brothers' sports. They always got the most expensive clothes from the mall, but I was only allowed to shop at the Kohl's discount rack. They always got the name brand shoes, but I always had to get my shoes from the thrift store. They got to stay out till midnight without anyone batting an eye or asking any questions, but I had to be home by like 9 and get interrogated about what I was doing and who I was with; etc. etc. you get the picture. \n\nMy brothers and I are literally the same age too (we're triplets), so when I hear about similar experiences I can almost 100% say that it's not an age thing, and it's not your parents trying to 'get it right' with the next one. It's a sexism thing.\n\nNothing will be able to close that gap, so you have to just move on from it. \n\nDon't try to decrease your brother's quality of life either, because that is not what will make you feel better, really. \n\nWhat did your parents think about you saying that you and your brother had completely different upbringings? Did they agree? Did they brush it off?", "NTA.\n\nThis is actually a true thing and has been studied in psychology. Despite living under the same roof and with the same parents, children do tend to have different experiences with their parents because 1) the kids are different 2) the parents react accordingly to the differences in the kid.

Was not aloud to do anything else until I was done. Meanwhile my brother was outside playing and riding his atv and dirtbike. Growing older I was barley aloud to leave the house and half the time my parents did not know where my brother was and were okay with it as long as he replied to their texts. I didn't leave home until I was 25 and I still had a curfew, brother did not and still does not. To this day I am not aloud to drink alcohol or bring up the fact I have drunken alcohol before infront of my parents but my brother and dad can down wine and beer together. No idea why. Oh! And my parents gave him about $2million to start a business at 21 and my partner and I are currently living paycheck to paycheck in a small apartment.\nYou are definitely NTA.", "NAH but sometimes parents realize they went too far with one kid so they adjust for the next one. You don\u2019t want them to punish him just because they made mistakes when raising you. I think the best thing you can do is distance yourself from their decisions unless they directly affect you. Watching the choices they make about him will do nothing but frustrate you if you\u2019re keeping score and thinking \u201cit\u2019s not fair.\u201d", "Esh, just to be clear, are you mad at your parents bcz they didn't let you do these things or bcz your brother is allowed to? \n\nImo, don't push your parents to make life worse for your brother by putting restrictions instead have a conversation about why weren't they understanding of this when you were younger.

That means he can change if ever taught and there is hope for him. \n\nI believe there are cooking classes and life skill classes at different civic centres or in cities/university (depending on where you are).

However, I\u2019m not the one putting off retirement plans because I can\u2019t afford to.
