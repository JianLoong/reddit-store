Your parents are sexist and are unlikely to change now. Your brother may actually be the unlucky one because he hasn't been parented very well. It may take him longer to grow up.  A useful consideration for you might be that your parents will reap what they have sown. They've created a bad relationship with you and an indulgent one with their son.  Feel free to distance yourself from them and create your own adult life.", "NTA, your parents, both, seem very sexist. They tried to prevent you from living your teenage years, while not doing the same for young brother. Chances are, it's because you're a woman. They either have that mentality where you \"raise your daughter with watchful eyes and your son set loose\" or they just always wanted a boy and spent his life spoiling him for that reason. In both cases, it's sexism.", "NTA, but I doubt they will change.  Make it clear to your parents if they are old or sick and need help, they will need to call \"golden boy\"", "NTA", "NTA. It seems very misogynistic to be so strict with you, but otherwise excuse and enable your brother.\n\nUnfortunately, doesn't seem like an argument you're likely to change them on.", "NTA but don\u2019t expect things to change. My parents have taken my siblings to trips to other countries, bought them cars and I haven\u2019t received any of it. It sucks, and I\u2019m proud of you for calling them out, but they won\u2019t change, going lc and accepting that helped me mentally get over it.", "NTA.\n\nI grew up similarly as the only daughter\u2014my two brothers got to do whatever the hell they wanted and always got preferential treatment. They got to pursue their sport of choice till college, but I wasn't able to continue swimming classes past the first year because my parents couldn't afford it as they were spending all their money on my brothers' sports. They always got the most expensive clothes from the mall, but I was only allowed to shop at the Kohl's discount rack. They always got the name brand shoes, but I always had to get my shoes from the thrift store. They got to stay out till midnight without anyone batting an eye or asking any questions, but I had to be home by like 9 and get interrogated about what I was doing and who I was with; etc. etc. you get the picture. \n\nMy brothers and I are literally the same age too (we're triplets), so when I hear about similar experiences I can almost 100% say that it's not an age thing, and it's not your parents trying to 'get it right' with the next one. It's a sexism thing.\n\nNothing will be able to close that gap, so you have to just move on from it. \n\nDon't try to decrease your brother's quality of life either, because that is not what will make you feel better, really. \n\nWhat did your parents think about you saying that you and your brother had completely different upbringings? Did they agree? Did they brush it off?", "NTA.\n\nThis is actually a true thing and has been studied in psychology. Despite living under the same roof and with the same parents, children do tend to have different experiences with their parents because 1) the kids are different 2) the parents react accordingly to the differences in the kid. That being said, it\u2019s not okay for them to have such glaringly different expectations of you both, that\u2019s not consistent and is not a sign of a good parent. \n\nNTA, call them out.", "NTA\nI feel you completely. My brother and I are 3yrs apart right now I 27(F) him 24. Since I was 8 every Sunday I had to vacuum the whole house and clean every bathroom, thats 3 bathrooms and 2 stories including every bedroom. Was not aloud to do anything else until I was done. Meanwhile my brother was outside playing and riding his atv and dirtbike. Growing older I was barley aloud to leave the house and half the time my parents did not know where my brother was and were okay with it as long as he replied to their texts. I didn't leave home until I was 25 and I still had a curfew, brother did not and still does not. To this day I am not aloud to drink alcohol or bring up the fact I have drunken alcohol before infront of my parents but my brother and dad can down wine and beer together. No idea why. Oh! And my parents gave him about $2million to start a business at 21 and my partner and I are currently living paycheck to paycheck in a small apartment.\nYou are definitely NTA.", "NAH but sometimes parents realize they went too far with one kid so they adjust for the next one. You don\u2019t want them to punish him just because they made mistakes when raising you. I think the best thing you can do is distance yourself from their decisions unless they directly affect you. Watching the choices they make about him will do nothing but frustrate you if you\u2019re keeping score and thinking \u201cit\u2019s not fair.\u201d", "Esh, just to be clear, are you mad at your parents bcz they didn't let you do these things or bcz your brother is allowed to? \n\nImo, don't push your parents to make life worse for your brother by putting restrictions instead have a conversation about why weren't they understanding of this when you were younger. Let your brother live experiences that you didn't get bcz of your parents' fault.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But you can\u2019t really demand that your parents control him because they controlled you. \n\nIt sucks being the Guinea pig oldest child to sexist parents. Get in therapy. Work on trauma.", "NTA \n\nI read your comments and I\u2019m sorry your upbringing was curtailed this way. I don\u2019t know if your parents will ever change, but you can control and change your reaction to their blatant favouritism. I\u2019m glad you are out of the family home. \n\nTherapy/counselling to work through and process those feelings will help. It\u2019s good that you have realized the double standard and can hopefully move on from that, as well as if you ever have your own family that you will not repeat the past. \n\nYour brother is lucky that you are helping him and it\u2019s great to hear that he does the work and is okay to do it. That means he can change if ever taught and there is hope for him. \n\nI believe there are cooking classes and life skill classes at different civic centres or in cities/university (depending on where you are). He may benefit from one of those. There are also books/articles and YouTube channels to help with life skills too. He can certainly look those up and/or purchase. It sounds like you care for him and that you are a good sibling. \n\nTake care Op!", "NTA. This is a feeling that you will only understand if you experienced it. As the oldest daughter, I get that it really sucks. Your parents are WAY to extreme though.", "Im sorry but YTA, parent usually are a lot harder on the first child because they need to figure out everything for the first time. \n\nThat you feel like you have been treated unequaly doesnt make you in the wrong here. But you arent discussing about what it did to you, you are trying (again) to disadvantage your brother over your own jelousy. Your problem isnt your brother fault. \n\nIt is time to grow up, you are 23 and you're getting to old for sibling rivalry.", "He is really incapable of the slightest task! He lives near to me, and comes over often. I have been teaching him the basic-est of life skills, how to wash dishes, make rice, the staples. How to peel and cut an onion. I do it because everyone needs these life skills. He is not stupid, just spoilt. And the worst part is it's not even his fault.", "Golden boy will eff the heck out of there.", "Sadly, no. I have tried and repeatedly failed.", "That's horrible. What sucks even more is that I have worked really hard to get where I am, whereas he was born with a golden ticket.", "I'm sorry to hear about your experiences!\n\nAs for their reaction, it was and has always been blatant denial.", "While I agree with you, I also feel what he is receiving, regardless of what I got, is overt for a college kid. He has trouble adjusting to his dormmate because he never needed to adjust at home. He wears overly expensive clothing and a lifestyle not appropriate for his age either", "Both. \n\nTo be clear, I feel my brother gets over the top treatment. As a college student he gets wayyy more pocket money than is required. Same goes for clothing and lifestyle.", "So, I have discussed it with them, or at least tried to, multiple times. However, when it keeps happening, you need to draw a line. \n\nThe problem isn't my brother's fault and I agree.

My parents never did either. \n\nThey don't respect you. Perhaps it's time to start disentangling yourself from them. I'm in very low-contact to no-contact with my parents nowadays, and it's been amazing for my mental health.", "I understand your anger but again, it's definitely something you should take up with your parents.. you're NTA, your feelings are being hurt since a long time.", "No they do not, what makes you believe that? Just because you feel a certain way or have an opinion doesnt mean they need to do what you want. They can decide what they do and do not want to do for their childeren. You have feelings that you can and need to discuss but not so they are going to treat your brother any different but so you are heard. \n\nI understand that it isnt easy but that doesnt make it any less of your responsibility. If you van not do it alone, get help.", "Draw a line in what way? They parented you and now they\u2019re parenting your brother. It\u2019s really not your business to decide how much money they should give him or even all the factors that might be going into their decisions.

He doesn't have any problem with doing the work, he just doesn't know how to. If I show him, he does it. What sucks is having sibling conflict due to parents.", "It's been the same for me. My mental health has gone up sooo much ever since I left home. I realise how fucked up the situation at home is, the way they've made it, and how they're always at each other's throats.", "This goes back to childhood, the smallest things. Getting the best parts of food. Different dishes being made for him when he didn't want to eat what was being cooked for everyone else. The works.", "The only decision was overcompensating. They know how they've treated me.", "Have you talked to your parents about this? What do they say?", "Blatant denial.", "That sucks :/ knowing this I'd change my answer to NTA, you have every right to be upset. Seems like a favouritism problem.. good thing that you moved out.. sometimes all we can do is learn to ignore and move on from these situations bcz we can't make people act the way we want them too.. i hope you find the strength to ignore and make a better life yourself and do things that you couldn't do when you were younger and in a restrictive environment", "Thanks :)"]}
