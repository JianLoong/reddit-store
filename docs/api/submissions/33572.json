Walking away from situations like this is rarely a bad idea.", "NTA, your mom is an adult, and it's not like you cussed her out and made her cry and then stormed out (at least from what you told us). You were not at all in the wrong for leaving for a bit to cool down, and if a grown woman is crying over a board game, that's on her tbh. She's the one starting drama, not you.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't ruin their trip. Your mom is responsible for her own feelings and actions, and she and your stepdad are solely responsible for how their trip goes. You're also 32, and can like whatever you like without considering how it might affect your mother's feelings. \n\nYou are not responsible for repairing the strained parent-child relationship.", "It\u2019s not your fault that a disagreement over a tabletop game somehow ruined your mom\u2019s weekend, in fact, her being upset at all is frankly ridiculous. You are a full adult, you know right from wrong at this point. Her obsessive need to control everything from a religious perspective is her problem to fix and control. NTA. Go enjoy your sessions, and take a break from your mom for a bit. She can\u2019t respect your perfectly normal life? She doesn\u2019t get to be in it for awhile.", "NTA for walking away from any conversation where someone else's view is being pushed upon you. Your mother could choose to talk to you about subjects you both agree on, but instead she's choosing the ones where you differ. Her mood is her own to control, so that's on her. What is there to smooth over when she can't agree to disagree?", "NTA.  She's controlling and the tears are manipulative.  You were right to walk out as I don't think this was something you were going to be able to agree to disagree on.  She's an adult and if she lets this sour her mood for the entire weekend that's on her.  You are not obligated to smooth this out.  She started it, not you.", "NTA\ud83d\udcaf\n\nTotally okay to walk away. You didn't make her cry.\n\nShe cried to manipulate & guilt trip you because she didn't have any valid argument to counter yours.", ">our differing views, especially on political and social issues, have strained our relationship\n\nESH, Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nYou both already know you have conflicting views on hot-button topics.  Stop engaging in those conversations.  It's entirely possible to have a relationship without ever debating D&D.\n\nYour stepdad and brother are likely fed all the way up with you and your Mom creating all this unnecessary drama.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What made her start crying?", "I considered that, but she rarely ever cries. I think that was part of why I was taken aback.", "I think that\u2019s what I was trying to prevent, haha. I don\u2019t usually handle conflict with her well, because it brings out my inner angsty teenage self, and I\u2019m trying to be an adult. I\u2019m 32, after all. Though I wouldn\u2019t say that I do that often, I guess I try to avoid conflict because I\u2019m afraid of being pushed to my limit and saying something I\u2019ll regret.", "What sucks is that I know you\u2019re 100% correct, but my nervous system hasn\u2019t quite agreed yet. I used to be pretty devout in my religion when I was younger, and my mom was proud of me. we would get into squabbles here and there but it wasn\u2019t anything serious. Her divorce from my dad was also really messy, so I tried to provide her with a lot of emotional support from the time I was twelve until my mid to late twenties when she married my stepdad. Now, we\u2019re not on the same page like we used to be, which is also something I\u2019m coming to terms with. I like who I am becoming, but I don\u2019t like what it appears to be costing me.", "To be fair to her, she didn\u2019t go out of her way to bring this up. I had to shorten this post quite a bit so I just stuck to highlights. What happened was my brother had actually gotten me a D&D related gift, and I opened it in front of her, not thinking that she would react in any sort of way. She asked me what it was, and when I explained it to her, that\u2019s when all hell broke loose.", "I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from here. I had to shorten this post quite a bit, and just kept it at highlights. But for additional context, the reason it got brought up was because my brother had gotten me a D&D related gift. I opened it, and she asked me what it was. I explained it to her, and then she reacted.", "For added context, my brother lives out of state, and I live in the same town as my mom. She and my stepdad recently went to visit him. He had a custom minature made of my first D&D character as a Christmas gift to me, and decided to send the package home with her to give to me since he wasnt going to make it home for Christmas. She didn\u2019t know what it was the entire time she had it on her. I got the gift yesterday when I went to visit her, and opened it in front of her. She asked me what it was, and when I explained it to her, she reacted poorly to it. Then there was back and forth \u201cit\u2019s just a game\u201d vs. \u201cno it\u2019s Satanic! Don\u2019t play that!\u201d", "It sounds like your mom was extremely selfish and only mostly praised you so long as you were doing what *she* wanted. It shouldn\u2019t have been your job as a twelve year old to emotionally support your mother, and certainly to not remain her emotional support for years. She should have sought professional help, a support group, something, anything other than her child to trauma dump onto. It\u2019s wonderful you\u2019re finding your independence and what you actually like! I personally think D&D is a great trauma tool with a good group. You can work on your communication, how to overcome small conflicts, and receive praise indirectly through your character. You also get to mess up without someone shaming you. Keep doing sessions if they make you happy, there\u2019s nothing wrong with playing :)", "So she stuck her nose where it didn't belong. I stick by my answer. She could have let it go, and chose not to.", "A \"heated argument\" can only take place with 2 willing participants.", "Okay, then perhaps that wasn\u2019t the best way to describe it. When I say \u201cheated\u201d, I more or less meant that it was on the verge of escalating. It was mostly back and forth \u201cit\u2019s just a game\u201d \u201cno it\u2019s not!\u201d And I felt like it was about to get worse.", "I agree, the moment her mom started her ignorant bs op should have left. She's 32, she doesn't have to stand there and be chastised by mommy.", "For your own sake, stop entertaining her bullshit. When she starts chastising you, leave. You're an adult, she can't spank you, that's assault. She can ground you, it's illegal to prevent you from leaving her house. The only person who has power over you is you."]}
