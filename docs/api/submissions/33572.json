Walking away from situations like this is rarely a bad idea.", "NTA, your mom is an adult, and it's not like you cussed her out and made her cry and then stormed out (at least from what you told us). You were not at all in the wrong for leaving for a bit to cool down, and if a grown woman is crying over a board game, that's on her tbh. She's the one starting drama, not you.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't ruin their trip.

You are a full adult, you know right from wrong at this point. Her obsessive need to control everything from a religious perspective is her problem to fix and control. NTA.

She doesn\u2019t get to be in it for awhile.", "NTA for walking away from any conversation where someone else's view is being pushed upon you. Your mother could choose to talk to you about subjects you both agree on, but instead she's choosing the ones where you differ. Her mood is her own to control, so that's on her. What is there to smooth over when she can't agree to disagree?", "NTA.  She's controlling and the tears are manipulative.  You were right to walk out as I don't think this was something you were going to be able to agree to disagree on.  She's an adult and if she lets this sour her mood for the entire weekend that's on her.  You are not obligated to smooth this out.

What made her start crying?", "I considered that, but she rarely ever cries. I think that was part of why I was taken aback.", "I think that\u2019s what I was trying to prevent, haha. I don\u2019t usually handle conflict with her well, because it brings out my inner angsty teenage self, and I\u2019m trying to be an adult. I\u2019m 32, after all. Though I wouldn\u2019t say that I do that often, I guess I try to avoid conflict because I\u2019m afraid of being pushed to my limit and saying something I\u2019ll regret.", "What sucks is that I know you\u2019re 100% correct, but my nervous system hasn\u2019t quite agreed yet. I used to be pretty devout in my religion when I was younger, and my mom was proud of me. we would get into squabbles here and there but it wasn\u2019t anything serious. Her divorce from my dad was also really messy, so I tried to provide her with a lot of emotional support from the time I was twelve until my mid to late twenties when she married my stepdad. Now, we\u2019re not on the same page like we used to be, which is also something I\u2019m coming to terms with. I like who I am becoming, but I don\u2019t like what it appears to be costing me.", "To be fair to her, she didn\u2019t go out of her way to bring this up. I had to shorten this post quite a bit so I just stuck to highlights. What happened was my brother had actually gotten me a D&D related gift, and I opened it in front of her, not thinking that she would react in any sort of way. She asked me what it was, and when I explained it to her, that\u2019s when all hell broke loose.", "I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from here. I had to shorten this post quite a bit, and just kept it at highlights. But for additional context, the reason it got brought up was because my brother had gotten me a D&D related gift. I opened it, and she asked me what it was. I explained it to her, and then she reacted.", "For added context, my brother lives out of state, and I live in the same town as my mom. She and my stepdad recently went to visit him. He had a custom minature made of my first D&D character as a Christmas gift to me, and decided to send the package home with her to give to me since he wasnt going to make it home for Christmas. She didn\u2019t know what it was the entire time she had it on her. I got the gift yesterday when I went to visit her, and opened it in front of her. She asked me what it was, and when I explained it to her, she reacted poorly to it. Then there was back and forth \u201cit\u2019s just a game\u201d vs. \u201cno it\u2019s Satanic! Don\u2019t play that!\u201d", "It sounds like your mom was extremely selfish and only mostly praised you so long as you were doing what *she* wanted. It shouldn\u2019t have been your job as a twelve year old to emotionally support your mother, and certainly to not remain her emotional support for years. She should have sought professional help, a support group, something, anything other than her child to trauma dump onto. It\u2019s wonderful you\u2019re finding your independence and what you actually like! I personally think D&D is a great trauma tool with a good group. You can work on your communication, how to overcome small conflicts, and receive praise indirectly through your character. You also get to mess up without someone shaming you. Keep doing sessions if they make you happy, there\u2019s nothing wrong with playing :)", "So she stuck her nose where it didn't belong. I stick by my answer. She could have let it go, and chose not to.", "A \"heated argument\" can only take place with 2 willing participants.", "Okay, then perhaps that wasn\u2019t the best way to describe it. When I say \u201cheated\u201d, I more or less meant that it was on the verge of escalating. It was mostly back and forth \u201cit\u2019s just a game\u201d \u201cno it\u2019s not!\u201d And I felt like it was about to get worse.", "I agree, the moment her mom started her ignorant bs op should have left. She's 32, she doesn't have to stand there and be chastised by mommy.", "For your own sake, stop entertaining her bullshit. When she starts chastising you, leave. You're an adult, she can't spank you, that's assault. She can ground you, it's illegal to prevent you from leaving her house. The only person who has power over you is you.", "NTA.  You're 32 years old.  You can live your life and play whatever games you want.  Mommy's crying is just a manipulation to get her way.  Boo hoo hoo!", "NTA. You're 32, so it's not your mom's job to police or control your leisure activities. Managing her own feelings is her job. It's time for you and your family to discover boundaries. It will improve your relationships with each other.", "Catholic here, Dungeons and Dragons is just a game, the same way Star Wars is a film franchise.", "NTA. My mom is similar. She'd wig out if she knew I was into tarot, for example, because that's Satanic lol. Your mom likely doesn't know shit about the game itself and yet she must have an opinion on it, like most evangelicals. I wouldn't call her. When she gets over herself, she can call YOU.", "Definitely NTA. I\u2019m experienced in Christian family members, My Gran is extremely religious and disapproved of me watching SVTFOE when i was 10 because one of the characters was a demon. Your mum\u2019s an adult, She needs to act like one.", "I feel for you, friend. My mom was like this growing up but now is weirdly chill about things. I have a really hard time approaching conflict, too, but I've found that if I just stick to being who I am and insisting on my voice being heard, my parents eventually understand and come around. It sounds like that's what you're doing, and I'm sure you'll find the strength to keep at it. Hang in there and know that, truly, her behavior is her own to manage. \n\nAlso, last year I realized that I don't ask myself why I do the things I'm doing often enough. Why does your mom think D&D is satanic? Does your mom even know? I wish I would've been able to ask her that when I was younger.", "NTA\n\n  \nStop even discussiong your hobbies with your AH mom-.", "NTA\n\nIf you are at all interested in having it out with your mother over this, [Dangerous Games](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520284920/dangerous-games), by Joseph P Laycock might be a good resource.\n\nTurns out that most of the stuff your mother is probably worried about can be traced back to one very mentally ill dude.  Among his other claims were that he spent some time as a vampire (ie. subsisting entirely on blood, being burnt by sunlight, etc.) and that the TV show Dark Shadows was based on his life.", "YTA", "See now that\u2019s the weird thing, my mom never fussed about the TV shows or movies I would watch, or video games I played once I became an adult. At worst, she used to just simply not get it. Now everything is suddenly (maybe not so sudden) Satanic.", "Perhaps an escalation in tactics to manipulate or control, since you've distanced yourself?", "Oh lord, these people are still in a snit over that game?  Look, the 80's are over.  And Mazes and Monsters sucked.", "Can I just GENTLY suggest that you seek out some counseling to get over these issues with your mom? I have a VERY SIMILAR mom, I think you & I would probably be friends because we'd relate so much!!, and thank goodness for therapy. Therapist helped me see that I can't change my mom, I can't count on her, and I can't expect from her things she is unable to give- like legitimization or real empathy. It's changed my life. It sounds like you were seriously parentified during the divorce, and that has long-term consequences and might be why you handle conflict so poorly (that's not a judgment on you, it's based in one of your comments). It takes time to come to terms with not being similar to the person who birthed you. I can strongly relate. But THERAPY because it helps so much!", "Then again, I never really bothered talking to her about this stuff, since I know she\u2019s not really into it.", "Perhaps. That would make sense.", "I'm honestly embarrassed that my generation perpetuates the Satanic Panic. \n\nRead a history book, y'all. Not one written by some fanatic that never left their box.", "Much appreciated. Therapy has actually already been in motion, I\u2019m just at the beginning of it.", "And to clarify, she might not be consciously thinking \"I am going to cry to manipulate this situation.\" I think a lot of manipulators don't actually make conscious choices to be most 'effective' at getting what they want, they just can't realize they're wrong and will try many methods to 'convey' that.", "Always good to remember that."]}
