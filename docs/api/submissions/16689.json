Why not be able to wear the headphones? There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s really weird to say that the baby will have problems with you having those on your head when she\u2019s distressed. The baby will not know either way! I think your wife is being unreasonable here. If you are less frazzled it will make you a better partner to your wife also. She can wear them too if she wants to not have the full impact of the sound! Heck, I wish I thought of that when my kids were little! NTA", "NTA. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wearing them.

I practice the do whatever the fuck you need to do to survive method of parenting and it's working pretty well so far.\n\nMaybe you could get some of those ear plugs which look a bit more subtle as a compromise?

There may be something deeper going on with your wife, ppd, birth trauma, just the overwhelming feeling that everything has changed and she's lost control?\n\nNone of that makes her an asshole, just a human.

You could try some of those Loop Earplugs (the ones designed to block out only some of the sound) if your wife is concerned about the headphones being too obtrusive as she gets older. \n\n\"Feeling what she's feeling\" is a strange thing to want from anyone, as she's mostly feeling \"I am hungry/tired/need my nappy changing/want a cuddle\" when crying at that age and not a lot else.

Your wife needs a baby book but don't do that.", "NTA as someone who has sensory overload triggered by sound the headphones are essential for dealing with a crying baby.\nYou are more sensitive to sound so it's an equitable approach to parenting not equal that needs to be applied. You will be a more successful parent while wearing them instead of removing them to be fair.\n\n\nI had two kids and they rarely cried, but now they are older they are loud and the things they like are loud you will need your headphones beyond the baby stage.", "NTA, although I will say maybe offer your wife a pair as well.
