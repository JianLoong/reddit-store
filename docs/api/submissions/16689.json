It's not like you're ignoring her. \"It's important to not block out her crying so I can feel what our daughter is feeling\" There's nothing deep about the crying, babies cry for a bunch of reasons, you're already figuring out why without having to suffer the full volume of the crying.", "I think you found a wonderful solution and have a sweet attitude with your baby and dealing with the crying in the middle of the night. Why not be able to wear the headphones? There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s really weird to say that the baby will have problems with you having those on your head when she\u2019s distressed. The baby will not know either way! I think your wife is being unreasonable here. If you are less frazzled it will make you a better partner to your wife also. She can wear them too if she wants to not have the full impact of the sound! Heck, I wish I thought of that when my kids were little! NTA", "NTA. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wearing them. You can still hear them crying. People don't understand how overwhelming it can be.", "Yeah. This is crazy. Totally NTA. I'm not autistic and I would have used them. What difference does it make? It's like saying you have to wash nappies by hand to experience the bad stuff...", "If you can still hear her cry and help out whenever she cries (whilst wearing the headphones), NTA.", "NTA.

They have worked wonders for me. They just filter the sound, so it sounds like you\u2019re underwater", "I'm also going NTA - the baby doesn't know anything. Nobody has ever told me not to wear my glasses because having something on my head will frighten the baby, but there will come a stage where she just pulls those headphones off you! \n\nI'm ND and a mum of two and yes it can be so overwhelming when the baby is crying (even for NT people too). I practice the do whatever the fuck you need to do to survive method of parenting and it's working pretty well so far.\n\nMaybe you could get some of those ear plugs which look a bit more subtle as a compromise? But honestly, I don't think this is about the headphones. How recent was your diagnosis? There may be something deeper going on with your wife, ppd, birth trauma, just the overwhelming feeling that everything has changed and she's lost control?\n\nNone of that makes her an asshole, just a human.

I don\u2019t have sensory issues, but I\u2019m planning to wear my AirPods when my baby\u2019s crying gets to be too grating. Does your wife understand that you can still hear the baby, that the crying is just muffled?\nThere are no prizes for being a martyr. You should be allowed to take care of the baby AND yourself.", "This is a great solution, you are NTA. You could try some of those Loop Earplugs (the ones designed to block out only some of the sound) if your wife is concerned about the headphones being too obtrusive as she gets older. \n\n\"Feeling what she's feeling\" is a strange thing to want from anyone, as she's mostly feeling \"I am hungry/tired/need my nappy changing/want a cuddle\" when crying at that age and not a lot else. I would have thought you being calm through that is a good thing, and it's not like you're dampening the sound of a 4 year old who is trying to tell you why she's upset?", "NTA\nAs long as you are responding and comforting baby, you aren't blocking her out completely, it's probably better for your ears too as babies can be loud when they are screaming.\n\nMay I suggest sometimes wearing the headphones (even turned off) around the baby when she's not crying, so she gets used to seeing you with them in?\n\nMy baby is really sensitive to seeing us wear hats / glasses and changes in our appearance. If she's in a good mood, she thinks it's funny, if she's in a bad mood or tired, it makes her more upset. So something to think about as she gets older.", "NTA. You\u2019re taking care of your baby, not just in the immediate instance, but in the long-term, by ensuring that you don\u2019t get sensory overload and autistic burnout. That would really impact your ability to co-parent! I think you need to make it clear to your wife that you understand her concerns, but that your headphones aren\u2019t going to scare the baby (source: am an ND parent, have noise-cancelling headphones), and they are allowing you to do your job in an equitable and equivalent manner to the way she does hers, rather than at a disadvantage. I think you can, lovingly and with grace and kindness, make it clear that the headphones are non-negotiable. Best of luck to you, OP!", "NTA \n\nIs your wife aware that she's being ableist?", "NTA.

The baby is four months old. Your wife is majorly overthinking this. It's perfectly fine to wear them to help you deal with your sensory needs so you can hold your baby! \n\nNTA. Your wife needs a baby book but don't do that.", "NTA as someone who has sensory overload triggered by sound the headphones are essential for dealing with a crying baby.\nYou are more sensitive to sound so it's an equitable approach to parenting not equal that needs to be applied. You will be a more successful parent while wearing them instead of removing them to be fair.\n\n\nI had two kids and they rarely cried, but now they are older they are loud and the things they like are loud you will need your headphones beyond the baby stage.", "NTA, although I will say maybe offer your wife a pair as well. Also this NTA judgement is contingent on you doing a good amount of work with the kids around the house. Usually women tend to do more of the housework and child rearing, so if you\u2019re an active and willing father (and you seems to be) then you\u2019re most certainly NTA", "NTA. If the headphones allow you to care for your baby when they're crying and not get overwhelmed, it's a safety thing for your baby that you wear them. Overwhelmed parents are how shaken baby syndrome happens. As long as you're caring for the baby in a way that's safe for both of you and doing your fair share of the caring, you're good.\n\nRemind your wife that your brain is different. The crying has a different impact on you than it does other people", "NTA\n\nHow in the world could anyone accuse you of doing anything wrong here? You're not doing your job as a parent any worse, you're just minimising the amount of suffering you have to endure. \n\nIt's like telling someone they should only ever listen to the TV at max volume. Just doesn't make sense.\n\nYou're doing a great job. Weird that your wife is against this.", "NTA\n\nI have autism too and very bad sensory issues.\nI cant see a reason why you should not wear your headphones when you need them. I dont think your daughter even notices but I could be wrong at this point.\nThat you are willing to not use them because your family wants you to and for the benefit of your daughter shows, that you are a fantastic dad.\nSo you are absolutely not NTA.", "NTA there are literally companies selling earplugs designed for parents to wear when their babies cry. It makes a lot of sense and I'd do the same thing, simply bc you can keep your energies up and be there more for your kid than the other way round. Your wife's arguments don't really make sense to me", "NTA and it's what everyone would do if they had any sense.", "NTA!!!!! I take it your wife is nt? And therefore doesn't understand! You've found a way to cope and can still hear her, just not in an overstimulaing way! That sounds great! Your wife is the Ah", "NTA! As a mother of a baby who screamed bloody murder for his first seven months, I got noise cancelling headphones to help me. I think it\u2019s a fab solution and means you can parent without being insane. Stick to it! You\u2019ve done nothing wrong and it\u2019s helping you to process everything going in. Good job!", "I think that\u2019s a reasonable accommodation that I\u2019d also make for myself (also autistic).

If you can still hear your baby enough to know she's crying and are actively helping to soothe, feed, comfort her then what's the problem? Seems like a solid solution to you getting overstimulated (which could lead to far worse and more dangerous situations if you're pushed to your breaking point) NAH only because you said your wife is not an AH, but I think her reaction to your solution is kind of AH behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What you're doing is the smartest thing you can do - taking steps to make sure you don't get overwhelmed/overstimulated while taking care of your daughter.

Your baby has no idea what those are . They aren't going to take offense to you having headphones on when your caring for them. \n\n\nWhen I was at my wits end with my son who had colic I would put my headphones in and blast music as I rocked him.
