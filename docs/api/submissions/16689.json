It\u2019s really weird to say that the baby will have problems with you having those on your head when she\u2019s distressed. The baby will not know either way!

I practice the do whatever the fuck you need to do to survive method of parenting and it's working pretty well so far.\n\nMaybe you could get some of those ear plugs which look a bit more subtle as a compromise?

So so NTA. Respectfully, your wife doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying. From the science side- babies/kiddos sense a LOT more than the average bear gives them credit for. Calming a child down as an adult while you your self are disregulated is an uphill battle. They\u2019re picking up on your heartbeat, your energy, the cadence and tone of your speech, your movement. If you\u2019re in a highly reactive space you\u2019re creating a situation where your child is confused because they\u2019re receiving some cues to calm and some cues (from your body) to agitate further. In fact I think a lot of family counselors would propose your idea as a solution if you\u2019d come to them with an issue of overstimulation!! \n\nBeing a parent is HARD!!! Why make it harder on yourself? The idea that suffering and sacrifice is necessary to be a good parent archaic and damaging.

She may be feeling a little overwhelmed herself (for such little beings, babies are a massive life change!). Maybe a couple of therapy/parenting sessions so you're both on the same page and understand each other. Does she understand that your headphones don't block the sound, just reduce the intensity to a level you can manage?

I also don't ignore my baby (she's 6 months old), I can still hear her and respond to her.

My oldest son is 7 and has autism and he wears the headphones a lot to help with loud noises. His little brother who is 3 and has autism symptoms as well as severe adhd has grown up seeing his brother with these and thinks nothing of it. When he looks at his brother he doesn\u2019t see autism he just sees his brother who he loves. He tries to wear headphones too even because he likes the pressure on his ears. Honestly it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if your wife was feeling jealous because she can\u2019t block out the cries. Hopefully she\u2019ll realize that her attitude is cruel and unreasonable and unnecessary and she could do with showing some compassion herself.
