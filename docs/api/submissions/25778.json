His mom needs to discipline her son because I\u2019d hate to find out how he\u2019d act out when he doesn\u2019t get his way when he\u2019s a teenager or young adult.  \nNTA but OP could have gone about saying it in a nicer way.", "4 losses myself here and going in for induction on Friday for our IVF wonder baby but I can\u2019t imagine raising a child that feels entitled to everything.", "My mom has delt with losing my twin and had a tubular pregnancy as well as a hard time getting pregnant. You can BET there's no way she would let me act like this let alone my dad", "I heard it's 30% after 7 weeks and the earlier we find out - the higher the chances. Was 2/3 chance for me, sadly. But still - if you want your kid(s) to have a good and easy life - don't enable the entitlement. A little timeout and a tantrum now can help you all avoid much bigger problems later.", "Its way more common than people think, it just wasn't something people talked about or acknowledged for a long time which... can't have been healthy. Also, a **lot** of  miscarriages happen early enough that the mother can't actually be certain they were even pregnant, so there are people walking around who've had miscarriages and never knew, which is an odd thought.\n\nBut yes, miscarriages of wanted (and often even of unwanted) pregnancies are traumatic and awful and can take a lot of time and effort to emotionally recover from. Quite a few of the women in my family and social circle have gone through them and while its been different for all of them its sucked every single time. Knowing its common doesn't make it easy, but I think it can help lessen the tendency to blame yourself and think of yourself as some unique failure of a woman because it happened to you, which I think used to be a lot more common before it was openly acknowledged as much as it is today.", "If the kid is so godamned special, why is he such a little shit?", "I\u2019m still stunned that people use a natural part of life (and death) such as miscarriages to try to make themselves and their boon somehow above others. \n\nI\u2019m a rainbow baby myself (double whammy, my older brother died because of SA) did my mother put my on a pedestal? Not when it came to my developing as a human being. Maybe with expectations, but if I tried to shove some a cake off the counter she woulda snatched me up and disciplined me for being a little shit.", "Besides that, he's going to get beat up. If she doesn't teach him boundaries and limits, then someone else will, and they're not going to hold back.", "They don\u2019t understand that their children are human beings", "There were a few, he had a sister called Angela and a brother called Alois after their father (half brother iirc), and another younger brother along with Paula. Alois married an Irish woman he met in England and had a son called William Patrick. Hitlers nephew literally went by Paddy Hitler, which as an Irish person is hilarious to me.", "He even had 2 half siblings of his father\u2019s second wife (first wife had no children with Adolfs father). The mother of Adolf had 3 children before she had him, but they all died before Adolf was born. Then he got another brother Edmund and sister Paula indeed. The point that he was born after multiple deceased children and his mother probably spoiled him because he was also often sick still stands. But the argument he was an only child doesn\u2019t. He was 3 when his brother Edmund was born and he already had 2 other half siblings whom lived with them because their mother (Adolf father\u2019s second wife) had also died. His third wife is Adolf Hitler\u2019s mother.\n\nInteresting fact: there are still blood relatives of Adolf Hitler alive. But they are determined to let the blood line die with them.", "Jim Jones was so much ick. Those poor people did not commit mass suicide. They were murdered.", "I'm not big on history but wasn't Paula his daughter?", "That's the first time I've heard of this. I would have remembered it, as that's MY first name. She died 2 months before I was born.\n\nWILD.", "And he also has a creepy cult-like following", "So was I and I have yet to invade Poland", "5 years old is definitely not a toddler either. 5 is school age in North America.", "I didn't say anything about the kid being disabled?

Please go talk to him about manners\u201d ... that\u2019s on Abby. \n\nInstead of what OP said \u201cyou might think your kid is special but we all think he\u2019s an asshole\u201d... that\u2019s on Abby\u2019s son.", "Then perhaps pull Abby aside & talk to her ... \u201cit appears your son is not having fun at the party so either to help him deal with that or take him home & keep him away from the cake\u201d", "Thats great - hope everything goes well with induction & on meeting your baby! My son is my rainbow baby & just sent my husband this to say we are not raising our son to be like this!", "Good luck!", "Congratulations and good luck.

Good luck!", "Congratulations and best of luck!", "Similar story here Mom miscarried during her first pregnancy but you better believe she didn\u2019t allow my sister or me behave anywhere near this spoiled.", "that only makes him a special kinde of shit", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 that is funny.", ">Interesting fact: there are still blood relatives of Adolf Hitler alive.

Hitler was not really a spoiled kid based on biography I have read by any reasonable standard.

Abby had already ignored OP\u2019s milder complaints about her son\u2019s behavior and dismissed it with \u201che\u2019s special.\u201d It\u2019s pretty clear that she wasn\u2019t going to hear anyone who tried to address this gently.", "Abby should of been watching and taking care of her son. OP shouldnt be the one hosying the party AND being responsible for her sisters kid. Chances are she asked abby to watch her son, and maybe said something to abby when he started to act out. But he tried to destroy the cake because it wasnt his. OP was justified in being mad at abby and telling her to watch her son. Abby is avoiding responsibility and accountability by wtiting off her childs behaviour because \"hes special\" if your kid cant handle not being in the spotlight thats a parent problem. \n\nI honestly dont think there was going to be ANYTHING OP could of said that wouldnt of been net with a \"bur hes my sopecial boy\" kind of response. So at that point you need to be blunt.", "Ah, gotcha. Learn something new everyday", "Does failed writer count? I suppose I should start gathering troops", "I am not even sure he was that much of an failed artist. He could feed himself by making and selling paintings. Not a middle class career, but a living. He did not get to university on his two attempts, but the selection process was pretty competitive and he got pretty far.\n\nHe refused to take extra lessons, because he knew better, so he fully deserved to fail. But like, his art quality has zero to do with stuff where he done bad things - like genocide and world war.", "Shit, good point", "Yet \ud83d\ude08 I'm biding my time", "Gotta pop that humanity first", "I'm simply waiting for the opportunity", "I'm working on it", "This has apparently going on for awhile... Abby thinks her kid is magical. It sounds like no one is willing to have a conversation about her behavior. Hey Abby ... If you continue to allow your kid to misbehave & do whatever he wants you will create a monster & we will not be inviting you to our home.\n\nI think the fact that everyone is missing is OP didn\u2019t want to invite them because no one expected this kid to behave so why is anyone shocked that he didn\u2019t?", "Judging by the German's coordination on r/place this year, they would be ready in moments notice.", "Please don\u2019t visit Europe.", "Just remember, don\u2019t try and invade Russians during winter, didn\u2019t turn out well for Napoleon, didn\u2019t work for Hitler, it won\u2019t go good for you", "No one is shocked that he didnt behave. What people at the party are upset about is that OP said anything at all. \n\nAfter nobody said anything for 5 years, this child is spoiled rotten. And despite it being in the childs best intrest to bring this to abbys attention, no one wants to because she had multiple miscarriages. While i understand they are traumatizing events, shes 5 years into raising a baby, about 3 years into a stage where beyond a freak accident she doesnt have to worry about her child being suddenly taken (i could be wrong but i think SIDS affects kids up to 2YO but i could be mistaken). So she needs to parent. She needs to move beyond the fact she miscarried before her son and raise her son. Letting hi. Get away with everything because they dont want to hurt abbys feeling is just as neglectful as abby not teaching her kid to behave. \n\nOP is NTA because she finally had enough and was blunt with her sister. \nAbby is a very soft AH only because in her grief she cant see that her sons behaviour is a problem that she needs to fix. \nOPs family are the AH for enabling abby to not raise her child because thwy dont want ro hurt her feelings."]}
