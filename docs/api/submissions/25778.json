She is setting her son up for a hard life full of disappointment and loneliness. That or in jail or worst.", "NTA. Even special miracle babies need to be held accountable for their shitty actions. Your sister needs to step tf up and parent her son.", "Ok, so, my MIL and FIL definitely did this with my hubby, and it has only led to more difficulties in his life than anything. He was their miracle after 10yrs of IVF and tons of endometriosis surgery, it was a lot for their marriage too...they spoiled him, did everything for him...I have taught that man so much since we've been together and he recognizes how harmful his parents lack of discipline or lack of letting him go through any challenges in life really did him a disservice as an adult. \n\nNTA", "I am going to buck the trend here, just to say that the behaviors she cited are not totally unexpected for a small child- plenty of them have problems with birthday parties that aren\u2019t theirs! I\u2019m NOT saying it\u2019s ok, of course it\u2019s annoying. I\u2019m just saying, in this unusual, exciting situation, judging the child\u2019s behavior is a tad harsh. And the family members might act with a little grace and help that mom with her overstimulated, underregulated child. And not be mean about it. Outside of the party situation, if mom is spoiling her child, maybe gentle discussion would start the process of her realizing her role in shaping him into a child that others like to be around.", "This kid is gonna get wrecked in school.", "Anyone who raises their child like this (regardless of having had losses or not) needs to watch the \u201cLibrary\u201d episode of Bluey (S2E30).

She shouldn't teach her kid that he's better than other people, and you should've told her that without insulting both of them.", "As they say in Bluey, you are the most important thing to me.

There\u2019s no way a partner could just sit back and let that shit slide", "NTA.  But almost ESH because all of the adults in your immediate family have bit your tongues and not had a private conversation with Abbie about her son's behaviour or more specifically her lack of parenting.  She isn't doing him any favours by not teaching him.  I don't really agree with your choice of words but something had to be said.  It's too bad it wasnt done before instead of waiting until it was a crisis  when he was inevitably disturbing a party.", "NTA \n\nSounds like your sister needs to watch a certain episode of Bluey lol.

I\u2019m a rainbow baby myself, but my parents didn\u2019t treat me any different from my two younger brothers. There were still consequences to bratty behavior, and rewards for good behavior.

This poor kid is going to end up terribly alone in life because he will alienate anyone who could have been his friend, all because mom refused to behave like an adult.", "Even worse. 50-75% of pregnancies end in miscarriage before the woman even knows she's pregnant. 25% end in miscarriage after a positive pregnancy test. 10 miscarriages is very rare, and obviously heartbreaking, but does not excuse a person ruining their child for life by not establishing rules and boundaries from a young age. I feel for OP's sister, but this poor boy is going to have a rough adulthood if this keeps up.", "NTA and she is indeed setting that child up to be friendless and lonely.", "Seriously. Even Jesus was disciplined by his parents, and he was allegedly a virgin birth and the son of God.", "I can imagine the kid growing up and being in some Theranos type scandal.

Invited mostly family and friends - I guess I'll invite my sister who has a 5 year old to my sons first birthday. I hate OP for that sentence alone. \n\nWe're talking about a 5 year old acting up at a birthday party. That shit is normal. Can't wait for OP to experience parenting a toddler", "Actually, my brother did rob a convenience store at gunpoint.

I don't really care WHY but any kid who throws a tantrum because the gifts aren't for them or wants to destroy a birthday cake for the same reason is spoiled and will be a problem if the parents don't start disciplining the kid.", "Yep.  It will only get worse as the kid gets older.  Imagine a teenager who has never been told no.

Usually we only hear the negative of a child that was spoilt. I'm so glad that we have proof that things can get better.", "Thank you so much for giving your perspective as the miracle baby, it is very insightful. Treating a child as special, to the point of said child being a selfish self-centered brat, sets that kid up for a VERY VERY lonely life. I'm glad you were able to get out from under all of that and get the help you needed. Wishing you a very happy life\ud83d\ude42", "No kidding, he's 5 so he should be starting school now if he hasn't already and if he has this behaviour in school, he's not going to have many friends, much less invites to birthday parties with the other kids because the other kids and their parents won't want him having a tanty and trying to destroy the party on their kids day because it's not all about him."]}
