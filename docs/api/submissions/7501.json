First off and foremost, your daughter didn't earn or work for it. Second, you would be teaching your son hard work is for naught. And lastly, she would be teaching your daughter that she should just ask mommy for whatever she wants. Why work for it?  \n\nFurther, I strongly believe that more problems would morph in the future. Things like brother being jealous and mad at sister since he has to work for what he wants and sis just has to ask. Also, it could impact future communications between your son and you.

I think your wife was too quick to jump in to buy your daughter the same expensive one when she may not even be interested in it after messing with her brother\u2019s. Also, the three year age difference means your sone will have things and interests he may not want to share with his little sister.", "NTA. You are absolutely right that your son worked and saved to purchase this item.

But you really should work at getting your wife to agree with your position rather than just overruling her. Maybe \"I acted rashly in returning the gun, but let's not give this to her until we've come to an agreement on the situation.\" This is an opportunity to cultivate a strong work ethic in your daughter. Talk to wife about what kind of entitlement the daughter would reasonably feel if given something freely that her brother had to work so hard for. And how much more she will appreciate and care for it if she wants it herself.

The fact she didn\u2019t seem at all proud of her son for his dedication or efforts, instead vilifying him for \u201crubbing it\u201d in your daughter\u2019s face, is not ok. \n\nShe is being a terrible mother in this situation.

Your son worked hard for that paintball gun. It\u2019s a great lesson, teaching your daughter that through hard work, you can achieve great things. And as the days go by and she watches him play with that paintball gun, I bet it will motivate her to work towards her own goals, as well. How would it make your son feel if your daughter just gets one out of nowhere, for nothing? He\u2019d feel so shot down. You are totally in the right here.", "Okay, I think NTA. You're right. It isnt fair. If one child has it, it doesn't mean thr other has to do. And your son has to work for it, but your daugther doesnt.", "NTA.  I would say it was bad that you took the gun back over your wife's objections...except she bought the gun without talking it through with you first.  \n\nAnd I agree her plan would send a horrible message to your son.  It's good that she doesn't want your daughter to feel left out, but this is totally the wrong way to go about things.\n\nMaybe a compromise would be to get your daughter an inexpensive paintball gun so she can still participate more easily?  Or to pay for a few sessions of rentals at a paintball field?", "NTA. I would've done the exact same thing. I can't believe your wife doesn't understand how that would make your son feel.", "NTA. You set a reasonable expectation of it being a gift for her birthday. Your son worked hard for it and set his rules for what he has now. Everyone was okay with the situation and your wife buying the exact same one just because your daughter was \u201cmature\u201d sends a bad message to both kids. He did something to earn his, she should have to as well or wait for a special occasion like her birthday where gifts are expected.

She is the one that overruled you by not even asking you for your input first.", "NTA \n\nYou both should have discussed it before it being purchased. \n\nAs it's so long until hey birthday would there be anyway for her to earn money doing chores?\n\nIf your son did save up his own money over time to buy it then she should be able to do the same.", "NTA, that would have been a terrible precedent to set and would be showing clear and blatant favoritism towards your daughter.", "NTA, but there were other options you could've offered your wife as a compromise:\n\n-Come up with a list of extra chores that your daughter could do to earn it earlier than her birthday\n\n-Given a gift of similar quality to your son as well at the same time (or refunded him what he spent on the gun).\n\nNot saying that either of those are the otpions you should've done, (especially the second option, if you are trying to teach your kids to work for special things) but those were options you could've taken", "NTA. Actual good parent regardless of what your wife says. You're right, too. Your son would probably feel very bad if he sees his sister get for free what he worked hard to get.

They either both work for it or they both get it as a gift.\n\nEdit: ~~Or do as your own son said and save it for a birthday gift, but he would need to get something just as good on his.~~ I misread that bit. I would also avoid gifting that, because it'd probably send the same message, but it'd still be a more appropriate than straight up just gifting the thing for no reason", "You, of course, are right. Makes me wonder why son didn't just ask her for one; instead of working and saving. (Exactly what a young man should do).\n\nIt hints at problems between the young man and your wife. Isn't she his mother? \n\nIf she wants to buy it for daughter, then an equal amount gets put into his car fund? What you did by returning it solves the problem, except wife has \"lost face \". Hopefully she's mature enough to leave it at that.", "NTA\n\nIf your daughter wants that paint gun then she should earn it, just as your son did. \n\nRemember/ whatever choice you make, it is a teaching moment. It is up to you whether it teaches the value of work or that your daughter doesn't have to earn what she wants. On the issue of it not being fair for your son to have something that he earned while your daughter doesn't get it for free, please have your wife let us know how it would be fair to your son to just give a gun to your daughter. She will be telling him that your daughter is the favorite and he doesn't matter. Favoritism is a terrible choice.

You have two kids who are into archery, and it makes sense that they both want to play paintball.  Do you buy their archery equipment, or do they buy it themselves?

That\u2019s the \u201cfair\u201d thing to do, but they are 3 years apart so it makes sense that your son has things your daughter doesn\u2019t.\n\nAgain, NTA but look for other signs of favoritism.

Whatever y'all have been doing as parents so far, it looks like it's working (based off this one story).\n\nIf your daughter still wants it for her birthday, that'll give her plenty of time to learn the safety rules that come with paintball.  If she wants it beforehand, is this a good opportunity for her to learn about saving up for nice things?  Neighborhood chores and babysitting are definitely things a 14-year-old girl can do as well, and it sends a good message of, \"If you like the nice thing someone earned, you can earn another one for yourself.\"\n\nWhat worries me is that your wife went out to buy an expensive gift for y'all's daughter without checking with you first, like partners do.  While your wife may have valid concerns about being overruled, it sounds like she went over your head first, and that may be something to work on as partners.  Have either of y'all complained about going over each other's head before (and if so, what was the context, from both of y'all's point of view)?  The idea that she sees her daughter being disappointed she didn't save up for something, but then agreeing to reasonable rules, as \"having it rubbed in her face\" is also concerning.  Finally, her idea of it being unfair would make a lot more sense if y'all had bought the paintball gun for your son, but not one for your daughter, or made her do chores to get the same gun.  \n\nAs it stands, you and your wife might want to wait until things calm down, and then talk through overruling each other and what y'all each consider fair to both kids.

One that she can still have fun with but doesn't devalue your son's work?", "NTA and I hope you show your wife the comments of ppl in this thread.", "INFO: Is your son also getting a present of similar value for his birthday?", "NTA, I actually find it incredulous that your wife didn't have second thoughts about what it was she bought.\n\nA paintball gun is still ***a gun*** that requires a basic understanding of proper use and safety (your son said \"strict supervision\" for good reason). It ain't some Nerf toy.", "This scenario happened with my brother. My father said he would need to work for a tv and he did and bought a new one. In the same day the tv arrived, my half sister saw it and said she wanted one too, and my dad went and got one for her in the same day. My brother was really sad about it. And you know about the best part of this? My sister don't even watch her tv, she loves to watch shows in my brother's tv. NTA", "NTA \n\nYour wife is being way over the top obtuse. If you use your wife\u2019s logic, daughter should get the paintball gun in 3 years when she is the same age he is now. Fair is fair, right? She gets that model when he got his. However, since son BOUGHT the paintball gun on his own, your wife is outta her damn mind about \u201cfair.\u201d If we\u2019re really taking about fair, it means that between now and the time she\u2019s 17, you\u2019ll help her grow her money so that she can buy her own. Encourage her moneymaking and saving ideas. THAT\u2019S fair. I don\u2019t understand why your wife is refusing to see this. \n\nThe best solution would be to buy for daughter\u2019s birthday a smaller and less fancy gun in the same brand/line.", "You are NTA, you are in fact looking out for BOTH of your kids.", "Buy the daughter one. Then give your son money for his. NTA. But other options.", "NTA.\n\nYour son would have been for sure angry and pissed of if his sister got the gun just like that without doing anything for it and without it being a special occasion like her birthday or Christmas (if you celebrate it). \n\nAnd your daughter handled it all well either way and her brother promised her to let her later try it out, too. And she was happy when she heard it might be her next birthday present. She can wait a bit for her gun.", "Nah NTA\n\nLook I get that your wife wanted your daughter to experience the fun of paintball but by getting the same gun you're absolutely devaluing the effort your son went to, to earn, save and buy it. If she wants to help either A. Teach your daughter the same life skills of saving and working for it and perhaps match her dollar for dollar since she may have a harder time with this or B. Buy her a cheaper/second hand one so that she can experience the fun of it and if she does enjoy it a lot then work on saving and earning for the upgrade", "NTA - y\u2019all sound like my parents.\n\nI was oldest, always had to earn everything myself/hit a milestone (age, test grade, etc).  My siblings then just got whatever I had earned because \u201cit wasn\u2019t fair for me to have something they didn\u2019t\u201d.\n\nI had to wait until 16 for a cell phone.  My 8 year old sister had one 2 months after my birthday.  I also got a job to buy my first paintball gun - parents bought my little brother one the next week so we could play together.\n\nWhile you\u2019re right that your oldest will learn their work has less value, the real danger is that your youngest will never learn that she has to achieve her own success.  I ended up getting a degree.  My brother has 4 duis and my sister is on her 3rd child by 2nd father.", "NTA when i was little my mother said if i cleaned she would buy me anything under 60 dollars and when i did it all by myself and said what i wanted. the day before my toy came there was 2 package and it was stuff for my sibling and my motherb said \"it's only fair if everyone get something\" after than i wouldn't do a chore for her without getting what i want first.", "Nta. Unless your wife plans on giving the dollar amount to your son to reward him for his hard work.", "I played a lot of expensive paintball when I was still cool... (my ego threw ropes at faces)   You don't need to break in a new marker, he was just being a dick.  You can teach your son to be proud in his accomplishment without taking the marker away from your daughter.  From one dad to another, do better.", "This is why communism doesnt work", "She could have given the paintball and compensate the son with a bit of cash to show a bit more fairness. Or promis a gift of similar value at his birthday.", "I bought myself a Gameboy colour with my pocket money because parents refused to buy any non-educational games. Plus Pok\u00e9mon. That Christmas my sister was given a Gameboy advance and 3 games.\n\nShittiest thing and blatant favouritism that I never forgave them for. This amongst other things now means I rarely talk to one of them, and the other I've voluntarily estranged myself from. Be wary, but also thank you for being the parent that mine couldn't be. \n\nNTA", "So... You cannot overrule her, but she can play favorites with your daughter without talking to you first? \n\nUltimately, you should make sure your son can handle his new hobby safely. Then tell your wife that she can buy the same thing for your daughter after she goes to a range with you and gets hit by no fewer than 3 paintballs. And this isn't a gender thing - it's an \"ow, oh my goodness that hurts and maybe I don't want to do it anymore\" thing. \n\nYour son saved up and is invested, your daughter thinks it is neat. Honestly, take your daughter to a paintball excursion and rent the equipment. If she still likes it, awesome! You can get her a starter and she can see how much she wants to get into it.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a good value to have. Also, being happy for her brother that he worked so hard for something and was able to get it for himself. I know that can be particularly difficult, as she is a teenager. But, that's when you start demonstrating and explaining these things! This also is a perfect opportunity for her to try a paintball gun, see if she likes it, and see if she would want one in the future. I believe there are places you can rent them, too. That could be an option. Or, \"rent\" it from your son for her to use at times - then your son gets money (toward paintballs or other purchases) and your daughter gets to trial it.", "NTA.  \n\nBeing fair to both kids doesn't mean that they have to have the exact same things.  Fairness encompasses more than that.  It takes into account your kids' development, their skill and interest levels, their efforts and the price that they had to pay to get what they wanted.\n\nAsk your wife if it would be fair to buy both your kids the same equipment, but to make your daughter do chores before she could receive her equipment while your son didn't have to.  The price someone pays for an object can also be fair or unfair, and if your son has to make a sacrifice that your daughter doesn't have to, that's not fairness.\n\nIt's okay for your daughter to wait.  It's okay for her to pay for something that she wants that your son also has to pay for.  You aren't a terrible father, you're just looking beyond the simple physical possessions, at the emotional costs.", "Yta giving your daughter a gift will not lessen her appreciation of money or things if it's not a repetitive pattern. It would have been something your kids could have done together. Bunch of resentful people in this thread lol.", "ESH\n\nAll you guys had to do was pay for both guns. Everyone wins. But even if that\u2019s not financially feasible there are still tons of compromises to discuss here but instead you both dug your heals in. Hell, you could have paid for half of his gun and half of hers if you couldn\u2019t afford both. Or you could have said the gun was an early birthday present so don\u2019t expect a fancy gift on the actual day.\n\nTons of options that went completely unconsidered due to poor communication.", "NTA", "Nta especially because the only way your wife's idea makes sense is if you give your son the money back that he spent on his gun", "NTA   \n\n\nOP, as an avid paintball lover (and avid sibling hater) I believe you did the right thing.   \n\n\nIf your daughter's birthday is too far away, can I suggest offering a compromise to your wife?   \nMaybe get her a cheaper paintball gun, something to help get her into the sport. Your son may also appreciate (or maybe he'd despise it, but it sounds like they are somewhat close, you gotta make that judgement call) having someone to go to the fields with.   \nI love having more people to go with.   \nGetting her a cheaper gun would help reinforce to your son that his hard work pays off for cooler toys, and they can still go play an awesome sport together.     \n\n\nAlso want to point out that your wife tried to make that decision solo, which is equally as bad as trying to trump her decision. Some of those guns run really expensive, as high as 2000 USD.   \nIt might not have been fair for you to overturn that in the moment, but it was equally shitty for her to try and make that decision on her own", "NTA, but if the gun was already bought...why dont you give your son some money as compensation?", "NTA you are spot on. Your wife is showing favoritism.\n\nYour wife is wrong, but you could tell her that of she gives the gun to your daughter that you will reimburse the son for his gun. That way he doesn't feel like his sister is the favorite", "NTA\n\n>my wife said I have no right to overrule her like that\n\nBut it\u2019s ok for her to overrule you on the topic?", "Same I was the kid saving for a game system. Then when I got it becouse my mom new I wouldn't share bought it for my nefues also.... and to this day you will not be able to convince me she does not like them more than me. (I love them a bunch too but it hirts still)", "Couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019ve never had something exactly like this happen, but many things similar, and it always manages to piss me off.", "My brother getting a fancy water gun that I didn't get as a kid (because girls don't play with guns) turned me into target practice because I couldn't fire back. That was a miserable (and sopping wet) Christmas. I agree with not just buying a kid something the other kid saved for but I have a lot of resentment about toys that could be used offensively against a sibling only going to one kid.", "And let's not forget that this isn't doing anything good for the daughter either. As OP states, it is telling (reinforcing?) the daughter that 1) all she has to do is complain and she'll get her way, and 2) anything someone has that she wants SHE SHOULD HAVE. That is not the way to way a well-adjusted kid.", "I think this is a great solution. There is the chance they bond over paint balling and all his hard earned money is returned to him making both guns basically a gift that is equal.", "I'm a lot older than you, but my parents were very good about keeping things even. They grew up during the Great Depression so my younger brother & I got a lot of hand me downs, including bicycles from older cousins. I learned to ride on a boy's bike & when I outgrew it, it went to my brother & I got another hand me down from an older cousin.  One Christmas Santa brought me a brand new bike. I was thrilled but my brother was angry & said it wasn't fair because he was still riding a hand me down.  Dad told him that I had been riding hand me downs for a lot longer than he had & when he had been riding them as long as I had, he would get a brand new bike, which happened several years later.", ">I am literally working through the security and ownership issues that caused in therapy right now\n\nmay i ask what this includes? is it about setting boundaries with the stuff you own?", "I like this, because it doesn't exactly shame the children who did break their phones. I have ADHD and easily break or lose things. I usually replaced them myself or had to wait until the phone contract was up to get a new one, but I was still always made to feel horrible if I couldn't keep things for long periods of time. \n\nThis way you're rewarding the careful kid without making the more careless kids feel like shit.", "That is BS\n\nOP NTA", "I love this so much!", "It\u2019s still reasonable to expect that the parent would make amends after being told what they did was unfair.", "I am so jealous of you guys and your good dads. :( I mean, I'm absolutely thrilled you guys had that. I'm just super jealous. Though, to be fair, while I don't have a good dad, I have found a most excellent brother in my roommate, and that's filled a hell of a void.", "Collective punishment is literally a war crime listed in the Geneva Conventions. As the 2nd of 6 kids, I thought that knowing this would deter my mother from using it. It did not \ud83d\ude05", "> By then, I doubt anyone will still be thinking about the paintball gun.\n\nFrom [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dohz5/aita_for_taking_back_the_paintball_gun_my_wife/j4mex1s/):\n\nPersonally NTA. But this is because **this exact scenario happened to me when I was a kid and it pissed me off for years.** I worked for an entire summer for something I wanted and as soon as I got it my mom went and bought the same thing for my sisters. Taught me I was worth less than them because we never had the money for what I wanted but always for the things they wanted."]}
