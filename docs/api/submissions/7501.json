First off and foremost, your daughter didn't earn or work for it. Second, you would be teaching your son hard work is for naught. And lastly, she would be teaching your daughter that she should just ask mommy for whatever she wants. Why work for it?  \n\nFurther, I strongly believe that more problems would morph in the future. Things like brother being jealous and mad at sister since he has to work for what he wants and sis just has to ask. Also, it could impact future communications between your son and you.

I think your wife was too quick to jump in to buy your daughter the same expensive one when she may not even be interested in it after messing with her brother\u2019s. Also, the three year age difference means your sone will have things and interests he may not want to share with his little sister.", "NTA. You are absolutely right that your son worked and saved to purchase this item.

But you really should work at getting your wife to agree with your position rather than just overruling her. Maybe \"I acted rashly in returning the gun, but let's not give this to her until we've come to an agreement on the situation.\" This is an opportunity to cultivate a strong work ethic in your daughter. Talk to wife about what kind of entitlement the daughter would reasonably feel if given something freely that her brother had to work so hard for. And how much more she will appreciate and care for it if she wants it herself.

The fact she didn\u2019t seem at all proud of her son for his dedication or efforts, instead vilifying him for \u201crubbing it\u201d in your daughter\u2019s face, is not ok. \n\nShe is being a terrible mother in this situation.

Your son worked hard for that paintball gun. It\u2019s a great lesson, teaching your daughter that through hard work, you can achieve great things. And as the days go by and she watches him play with that paintball gun, I bet it will motivate her to work towards her own goals, as well. How would it make your son feel if your daughter just gets one out of nowhere, for nothing? He\u2019d feel so shot down. You are totally in the right here.", "Okay, I think NTA. You're right.

I would say it was bad that you took the gun back over your wife's objections...except she bought the gun without talking it through with you first.  \n\nAnd I agree her plan would send a horrible message to your son.  It's good that she doesn't want your daughter to feel left out, but this is totally the wrong way to go about things.\n\nMaybe a compromise would be to get your daughter an inexpensive paintball gun so she can still participate more easily?  Or to pay for a few sessions of rentals at a paintball field?", "NTA. I would've done the exact same thing. I can't believe your wife doesn't understand how that would make your son feel.", "NTA.

He did something to earn his, she should have to as well or wait for a special occasion like her birthday where gifts are expected.

Actual good parent regardless of what your wife says. You're right, too. Your son would probably feel very bad if he sees his sister get for free what he worked hard to get.

They either both work for it or they both get it as a gift.\n\nEdit: ~~Or do as your own son said and save it for a birthday gift, but he would need to get something just as good on his.~~ I misread that bit. I would also avoid gifting that, because it'd probably send the same message, but it'd still be a more appropriate than straight up just gifting the thing for no reason", "You, of course, are right. Makes me wonder why son didn't just ask her for one; instead of working and saving. (Exactly what a young man should do).\n\nIt hints at problems between the young man and your wife. Isn't she his mother? \n\nIf she wants to buy it for daughter, then an equal amount gets put into his car fund? What you did by returning it solves the problem, except wife has \"lost face \". Hopefully she's mature enough to leave it at that.", "NTA\n\nIf your daughter wants that paint gun then she should earn it, just as your son did. \n\nRemember/ whatever choice you make, it is a teaching moment. It is up to you whether it teaches the value of work or that your daughter doesn't have to earn what she wants. On the issue of it not being fair for your son to have something that he earned while your daughter doesn't get it for free, please have your wife let us know how it would be fair to your son to just give a gun to your daughter. She will be telling him that your daughter is the favorite and he doesn't matter. Favoritism is a terrible choice.

That\u2019s the \u201cfair\u201d thing to do, but they are 3 years apart so it makes sense that your son has things your daughter doesn\u2019t.\n\nAgain, NTA but look for other signs of favoritism.

You didn't call out your wife in front of the children, you didn't make her look \"weak\".  She should have consulted with you first.", "NTA. \n\nMom is confusing equitable with equal (and this is neither).", "I'm probably going to be heavily downvoted for this but personally, I think ESH. Your son is 17 and your daughter is 14 she legally cannot work, but he can. I don't think returning the gun was a good idea, but keeping it for her birthday was the best. I do understand and would be annoyed if I was your son, but I can also see the frustration from daughter too.", "NTA. Your son saved up  his own money to buy it. Life isn't fair. Sometimes one will get things the other doesn't because...life. It's a lesson that should be learned early to teach how to manage feelings and expectations.", "NTA - \"fair\" does not always mean \"the same\", and it seems like your daughter gets it. Maybe you shouldn't have unilaterally returned the gun, but she shouldn't have unilaterally bought it, either.", "Edited to change to nta bc the 14 yo has ways to make money the same as the 17 yo.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like jealousy and insecurity that your SON likes something but that you are threatened by your wife and daughter showing an interest in the same sport.\n\nAnd extra misogynistic controlling AH points for just returning what your wife bought.", "Same here. Or I flat out have to give my sister the stuff I worked so hard for.", "Exactly. The resentment lasted years.", "This 100%^^ great explanation.", "Holy shit. The \"perfect the way you are\" = \"no potential\" comment is genuinely game changing with that perspective. I don't particularly know how to word what I'm trying to say but it's like you just made something thats bothered me my whole life finally make sense.", "Agreed.\nShe could buy the paintball gun for the daughter AND give the same cash value as the paintball gun to the son. That way the son keeps his hard earned cash. She cannot just buy it for the daughter after the son worked so hard for it.", "Oh, but she did earn it, \"for being so mature,\" remember? :) But then, I suppose she is significantly more mature than her mother.   NTA", "And why, oh why, the exact same one?", "I have to agree here. Is she going to give OP's son back his hard earned money? If not, this looks like someone is playing favorites and OP's son might become resentful. The daughter is old enough that she understands her brother worked for this and bought it himself.", "Daughter *may not* be that interested by the time the birthday comes around- it\u2019s sounds more impulsive than anything else. She may think it over and there may be something that she would like more than a duplicate.", "Okay, I think NTA. So if your wife bought for your daughters birthday specifically then you\u2019re in the wrong. But strictly on what you\u2019ve posted, I actually agree.", "Ummm OP already told daughter that they would GIFT her the same paintball gun for her birthday.... So the OP already told her that they would give her freely what their son worked to earn...  OP didn't even mention the 'earn it' rule until suddenly it was a random gift rather than a birthday gift.", "Also it IS fair for one child to have something another doesn\u2019t if that child worked for it. What\u2019s not fair is then undermining the child\u2019s hard work by handing out the same thing to someone else.", "We let our kids do chores for money. $5 for the dishes. $1 for taking out the trash. $10 for weeding the garden boxes & $15 for the backyard. That kind of stuff. He also babysat a bunch of kids in the neighborhood. I don't know what he was charging for that.", "His next birthday is his eighteenth, so he's getting something way better than a paintball gun.", "That's a good compromise. Yes, we did buy the archery equipment, but usually as part of Christmas gifts.", "Well her birthday is in September, so that wouldn't make sense. We don't have separate accounts.", "I would infer that the wife just got it because the brother bought himself one and wouldn\u2019t immediately let his sister play with it. Wife said they needed to reward the daughter for being mature about not being able to immediately and unsupervised, play with the paintball gun. I think it\u2019s bogus to buy a kid a toy for being mature that they can\u2019t have that exact toy yet.", "September", "The brother **worked for it**. It's not like the dad gave the brother one and is withholding one from the daughter. The son saved up his own money and bought it on his own. OP is 100% correct that all the mom is doing is teaching the son that his work was worthless.", "I don't think it would be appropriate to put that on him.", "Why put him in an awkward spot? That's an absurd solution.", "Dang that is actually a really good point too. I was thinking NTA but this has me questioning it and I'm not even the OP.", "AFAIK he said she'd get one, not the same one.\n\nTherein lies the problem.", "Getting it for the birthday make sense because the brother is going to revive something on his birthday to. What doesn\u2019t make sense is her receiving something expensive randomly while her brother doesn\u2019t and had to work for it.", "Honestly, not to be an armchair psychologist or anything, but I think she just wants our daughter to like her more. She's going through that phase where teenage girls decide their mother is the enemy because their hormones are driving them crazy.", "Yeah, we could get her a cheap one.", "I think they've played before at birthday parties and such.", "What? Where did you get misogyny from a dad saying that one child\u2019s hard work shouldn\u2019t just be given to the other child for no reason? Like he said if his daughter really likes the paintball gun THAT much she should wait for her brother to give her a turn and wait for her birthday for one. Nowhere did he say his daughter couldn\u2019t have because she\u2019s a girl. NTA OP", "I don't know what's more dysfunctional, your reach or your comment history.", "It's always fun to see how someone will twist something to be misogynistic on this sub.", "This is the dumbest take I've seen on reddit in a while. That's quite a high bar to clear.", "He's not threatened by his wife and daughter liking the sport he's upset at the message that his son has to work for something but the daughter will just be given it for free if she wants it.\n\nNot every situation is riddled in misogyny its a lesson that the son worked hard and is getting the payoff from that.", "Are you able to read? He literally told the daughter he was going to buy it for her birthday. He just doesn\u2019t want the daughter to get randomly and for free something her brother had to work for.", "Wow, hope you cut contact.", "Was thinking the exact same thing.", "And this is also a mistake.", "I think this needs to be in the original post bc I would have picked differently. She has the ability to earn money and save money. I was sitting there thinking your wife was making it somewhat equal bc the 14 yo doesn\u2019t hVe a job.", "Just a suggestion, but you and your wife could come up with a paintball gun chore plan for your daughter. Maybe add some new one-time chores that are worth more since she can't babysit to earn additional money. This would let her earn the paintball gun earlier, but still show your son that his work was worth just as much. Your wife might also like this better since your daughter wouldn't need to wait as long.", "INFO: is the cost of the paintball gun within the usual range of what you spend on birthday gifts for your kids? And do you usually spend equal amounts on them for their birthdays?", "Oh than im going NTA sounds like she was just going to get it for her and Son or no son that does not send the right message. You have joint account so you had a right to return the purchase.", "Ok then NTA, you\u2019re right that your daughter shouldn\u2019t just be handed something when your son worked for it", "Exactly, as a youngish human he might struggle to decide what is fair, and instead do what makes his sister happy. OP, you're doing a good job, and this story shows the only immature one in the house is your wife. She just wanted to buy your daughter's love.", "Thank you for this answer. It absolutely wouldn\u2019t be fair to put parental responsibilities onto your child. For what it\u2019s worth, I think you\u2019re doing a good job. You gotta teach value. It\u2019d be one thing if his had also just been a gift, but it wasn\u2019t.", "[deleted]", "Really? Cause the OP said the issue is just gifting her what her brother earned.... When the one who suggested gifting her the same thing her brother earned was the OP? Sooooo I'm going with ESH.", ">My wife is furious with me. She said I am being a terrible father. ...my wife said I had no right to overrule her like that and was being a massive dong.\n\nThat doesn't sound like someone who just wants her daughter to like her.\n\nIt sounds like someone who has been holding onto a grudge of her own since childhood.", "Its actually impressive how people go looking for a way for the guy to be wrong, and some of the ridiculous lengths they'll go to in order to justify that.", "Was low contact for many years", "It is a bigger ticket item than we would normally get for a birthday, however his next birthday is 18, and he will get a car. So his sister getting an expensive paintball gun the same year seems fair. A $10-15k car trumps most other gifts.", "My man. An expensive paintball bun is around $1500-2000, or maybe more, cause its been 10 years since I played.", "I made this mistake too. The birthday line through me and I'm like I thought they agreed to get it assuming her bday was sooner.", "The problem comes in outside of the son. Even if the son is like \"Nah, that's totally cool, get her one and we'll go to the field together\" there's still a very important lesson that can help the the daughter or be potentially detrimental to her happening here.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to setup something like \"You can either wait to join your brother playing and pay for it by saving up like him, or we can give you this upfront but there's going to be some interest on it\" (so she ends up having to pay a couple of weeks extra allowance overall to get the experience early.) \n\nJust giving it to her and missing the lesson is a terrible solution, especially when she was mature enlugh to go along with the initial terms set.", "> I told her that maybe she would **get one** for her birthday, and she was excited by this idea.\n\nOne. Not the exact same model.", "I mean, if it\u2019s only a little above the usual birthday budget for each of them it\u2019s not *that* big if a deal. Your wife should have definitely had a conversation with you beforehand though. \n\nIf it\u2019s twice what you guys usually spend though maybe work out a deal where daughter is willing to work off half the price with extra chores or something. Your daughter would of course need to agree to this first.\n\nLarger gifts on milestone birthdays also make sense and shouldn\u2019t effect other gifts. Is she going to not get a car now when she turns 18 because she got a bigger gift that cost 20% of her brother\u2019s a few years earlier?\n\nNTA.", "Wife went out and bought one right away so it seems they are comfortable spending the money. OP didn\u2019t mention being upset about the money, only the message. Sounds like it\u2019s easily manageable for them financially.", "I\u2019m well aware of what a paintball gun costs. \n\nWould you mind on elaborating on how your response contributes to the conversation or answers either one of the questions asked?", "Is your objection really that it was the same exact model? Seriously? Because all the comments and the OP is claiming it's about 'working to earn it'... Only the OP literally told their daughter she wouldn't have to work to earn it, she'd just have to wait until her birthday.", "She'll be getting a car at 18 too, but 21 is also a milestone birthday that we'll probably do something big for. By then, I doubt anyone will still be thinking about the paintball gun.", "My objection, and OP's, is that it's an equally good, equally expensive model."]}
