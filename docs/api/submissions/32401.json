Do you have a history of not taking care of yourself beyond not brushing your teeth (e.g. not taking meds, not drinking your shakes).\n\nAlso, you are in the <5% for your height at your age.

The rules get relaxed when you can show that you're responsible for yourself. The more you act like a petulant child, the more the rules are going to stay around.\n\nNo screens until your homework is all done is a completely normal rule that a lot of parents have for their teens. Having a set bedtime is a completely normal rule that a lot of parents have.

Want to be treated as more mature? Act more mature and start a normal adult conversation about it. And honestly the only rule I'd see viable as being tweaked a bit is bedtime rule.

Because if not, then they are going to keep babying you.", "NAH \n\n\"They all treat me like a little kid.\"\n\nYou are 13. I know you feel older and wiser but I promise you, you are still a child. You're not an asshole because you're 13 and literally every 13 year old feels this way. Your siblings aren't assholes because all of their rules sound pretty age appropriate and/or based on extenuating circumstances for you specifically.\n\nI don't know why you have ended up with your siblings raising you, but it sounds like they love and care for you well. I think it would be fair to discuss with them that you are getting older and want a little more freedom, but don't expect that to necessarily come in the form of more screen time, and don't expect anything if you are acting out all the time and telling people to \"fuck off.\"", "A soft YTA from a past over-controlled child. Your siblings are infantilizing you a bit, but not as much as you would think. My mom didn\u2019t get me a phone or have a TV until I was in highschool, and yes it was embarrassing. Yes I felt ready for so much more. But looking back? I\u2019m so glad she did. I\u2019m the only person in my social circle I know that\u2019s not addicted to my phone. Being enforced to do daily hygiene habits is sadly not the average, and your siblings are making sure you learn those good practices before you live by yourself and aren\u2019t enforced to. Yes it sucks right now, and it\u2019s so hard to understand from your POV, but try to appreciate what your siblings are trying to do for you. And let yourself be a kid! God knows so many of us miss it lol- be silly with your niblings and be kind to the babysitter (it\u2019s not their fault). \n\nAnd if that\u2019s too much, at least at first, speak in a way your siblings will try to understand. \u201cI\u2019m upset with this situation, and I\u2019m going to keep to myself this evening.\u201d Or \u201call my friends are allowed to do this, and I\u2019m feeling really left out.

You're 13, still a child and as such have to follow rules. I'm sorry you don't like them but that's life and they have reasons for the rules. You are also short, I am as well, and your state probably has laws about heights in cars, as mine does, and I had to use a seat until I was 10. They are keeping you safe in a large vehicle. Follow the rules and try to have a better attitude. You sound very selfish and entitled.", "Sounds to me like your parents think you still need a babysitter.  From your post, It sounds to me, that you still need a babysitter.", "YTA just because they are your siblings does not mean you are equal in age to them. They are adults and you are a child. They know what's best for you. You do not. There are reasons all through your post that show why you should be treated like this but since you are a child you don't see it. my hope for you is that as you get older you appreciate what they are doing for you rather than resent being treated age appropriate by them. Also think about this, if they weren't taking care of you where would you be? what kind of situation would you be in? do you really think it would be better? If you do maybe you need to talk to a few foster, adopted and homeless kids to truly see that you are being treated very good.", "They love you enough to coordinate on care and life choices, good people, good parents. It suckss but you should just comply and be happy so many people love you that much.", "YTA. Also, behaving that way is not going to convince them that you are mature enough to start to make those sorts of choices for yourself.\n\nIt's fine to feel frustrated about some of the rules, but the more adult, and likely more effective way, to get them to change is to show that you are mature enough to let them relax the rules a bit. \n\nIt's not inherently unreasonable for them to put limits on you screen time or to require that you do your homework first. It's not unreasonable for them to want you to be safe ion their vehicles . it's not unreasonable to have a bedtime .\n\nIgnoring their rules and refusing to do as the sitter said doesn't show them that you are old enough to decide for yourself, it just makes you look like a petulant child.\n\nSit down and talk to them. Explain that the rules feel very restrictive and that you feel they treat you like a much younger child.\n\nAsk that they stop supervising you in cleaning your teeth, that you are allowed a later bedtime , at least on days when you don't have school in the morning.  In relation to the car, it depends on the rules where you are, maybe do some research into the safety guidance and show that to them, to ask that they stop making you use the booster seat and that they allow you to sit in the front sometimes . Listen to what they say and why they don't agree, if they don't - maybe they will want to set some conditions of things that you need to do in order for their rules to be relaxed -listen to what they say and follow through.", "NAH\n\nyou are still a child, you are only 13.

That must be awful for you to be so cherished.", ">They all treat me like a little kid\n\nYou *are* a kid.  You\u2019re 13: you\u2019re *supposed* to have a bedtime.

Nothing you listed is unreasonable and they absolutely have the authority to decide whether or not you need a sitter. And your action didn't earn you any additional privileges, they just proved that you need a sitter.", "Light YTA.\n\nIt's hard to be bossed around by siblings. You're getting to a point where you need a bit more freedom, and you're feeling like your siblings are treating you like their kid instead of their sister. The best way to demonstrate you're maturing is to act that way. My younger sister is 40, and is 4'10. She fights to be taken seriously by most adults in her life. I get that it's hard, but at 13, you still need some parenting. Maybe sit down with your siblings and make a case for some more freedoms. Explain your feelings, and have a talk about the things you're struggling with most.", "NAH. \n\nYou're at a very tough stage in life. You're barely done being a child, and you're not quite a full fledged teen. Plus, physical development is vastly different around this age - I bet you have some kids in class who could pass for grade school kids and some that could pass for Jr's in high school. \n\nThe really tough spot you're in is that you more closely fit the kids than the people 28 years old and above. If there aren't tweens or other people your age, you're going to be lumped in with the kids. \n\nSit them down and update expectations. I guarantee that you're seeing maturity in yourself that is easily missed or forgotten by them. For you, being 11 was an eternity ago; whereas it likely feels that it was just a couple months ago for them. So, talk to them and negotiate updated expectations and boundaries. The more maturely you approach the issue the better.", "I know it\u2019s really hard to understand when you\u2019re a young teen what good parenting looks like. The sad ugly truth is that good parenting is way in the minority. It might not seem fair because other teens might be parented differently, but the real talk is that other teens really should be parented how your siblings are parenting you.

You need to focus on school, being a good person, and respecting your siblings whom clearly care a great deal about you. I wish I had parents/adults that were as active in my childhood as your guardians are. \n\nI'd also like to urge you to get the hell off of reddit and any/all social media. I work in a prison and these predators are everywhere and groom young people like you all the time and you won't even realize it until you're assaulted or dead.", "YTA. I joke that Reddit is all teenagers and probably most of y'all are. But you are most certainly a child, and a child needs rules. You're not even in high school yet. You have to bunk with the kids? Did you think you were going to have your own room? You have trouble brushing your teeth at night but you don't think you need a babysitter? I'm done", "Others have said plenty about the rules and routine being normal and healthy for someone of your age. I want to step in and acknowledge how difficult and frustrating it must be to have 4 people parenting you. I know that you don\u2019t want any of them but maybe it would be easier for you to allow one or two of them to take on primary guardian roles. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s easier on them to split up the responsibilities. But maybe they are fine with changing how things work. The reason I suggest this is that I remember being a teenager and my father was a truck driver. He was never home and when he would come home he had no idea how to talk to me, discipline me, work with me, instead of everything feeling difficult. Allowing one or two of them to step in more full time might make it easier to get into a routine and have a more common understanding of your needs and your relationship may feel more like a cooperative conversation than an argument. Obviously sometimes things are just difficult between adults and teenagers, but mutual respect is possible. \n\nI wish you the best of luck and hope you and your siblings can find balance together.", "YTA, BUT there are adult booster cushions. I feel bad if they're making you use some kids' booster seat because if I were you, I would feel understandably mortified. \n\nAlso, had it occurred to you that the babysitter wasn't just for you? It's not all about you, but clearly there were some issues where they just want to make sure there's an able bodied adult making sure you do take your medication and do your homework. You told her to fuck off?? You won't be treated like an adult until you start acting like one. You had a chance to prove yourself and you destroyed it by behaving that way. You could have been kind, not argued, and even helped with the younger kids. Take it as a lesson learned and be better.", "You sound like hell to deal with and you are only 13.

But it isn\u2019t automatic.  The kids generally have to prove they are ready.  \n\nOP, it is time to have a discussion with your siblings about what their expectations of you are, what will it take for them to be satisfied that you no longer need a babysitter.  Begin the discussion by apologizing for your behavior towards the babysitter as you know she was trying to do her job and you made it hard for her.  Explain that you were upset because most of your classmates no longer have babysitters and you felt humiliated by this.  But again, you shouldn\u2019t have given the babysitter a hard time.

Your siblings view you as a kid and that sucks, because to you they\u2019re just your siblings, they\u2019re not figures who should have this kind of control over you.\n\nBut they do, and to be honest, I think they\u2019re failing at it. Not for most of what you\u2019re complaining about here \u2013 you need to take your medicine, you need to respect the baby sitter even if you don\u2019t like her or don\u2019t feel like she should be the boss of you, and while the booster seat is probably humiliating, there\u2019s better ways to have a talk about it (e.g., sit down your siblings, ask them why the booster seat is necessary, because they might not want to get in trouble with the law and risk losing custody of you, or maybe they just don\u2019t fully understand how much it irritates you).\n\nNo, I think your siblings failed because they put the weight of who to live with on you, and then rather than determining who was best, they decided to split it four ways. I\u2019m not sure what a kind of custody agreement could even look like with that, but you probably feel like you\u2019re always being shuffled around, right? Like you don\u2019t have a stable home life. Like you don\u2019t actually have an older sibling you can be comfortable with. And I think this dynamic would probably be easier for you if you did have one you could be fully comfortable with. I think you need to talk with them and tell them this shuffling you around isn\u2019t working. This might require you having to pick who you want to live with anyways, and I know you don\u2019t really want to live with any of them. But think of it this way: it\u2019s 5 years until you turn 18 and go to college/get your own place. That seems like a long time now, and it\u2019ll seem like a long time while you\u2019re living it, but 5 years isn\u2019t all that long at all.\n\nI also suggest either apologizing to the babysitter or writing her a letter (a sincere one, outlining what you did was wrong and that she was the wrong person for you to take out your anger on) that one of your siblings can pass on to her. If you show some maturity and recognition that this was unfair, your siblings will probably be more willing to listen to you than you might think.\n\nHang in there.

If there was an accident you could be seriously injured or killed because car seatbelts are designed bodies much larger than yours. \n\nIt also make sense that your siblings lump\nYou in with their kids.

Tough it out and try to be a bit more respectful and responsible and you may find things change for you. It's all part of growing up", "You're really not gonna like this but YTA\n\nLook kid I WISH that at your age I'd had parents/guardians that cared enough to get me a baby sitter at 13. I was regularly left at home watching kids that ranged from 5 to 11 years younger than me by the time I was 9. (12 when the last sibling was born and old enough to leave at home with me). They have the foresight and responsibility to NOT do that to you, they obviously want you to have the best childhood they can offer. \nWhen I was 7 they took me out of the booster seat and I guarantee you I was not 4'9\" at the time. Your siblings sound like they care about you and love you very much otherwise they would not take such precautions to keep you safe.\nInternet safety is extremely important and I didn't have guidance or parental controls. I got into a lot of stuff I shouldn't have and it messed me up mentally.\n\nYes you are older, yes you may feel like you deserve more freedoms, however, you are still very much a child. You are BARELY a teenager, and such privileges as later bedtimes, more responsibility and freedom, etc. Must be earned as you get older. Show your siblings that you are trustworthy and you'll behave yourself even when they aren't watching you 24/7. Be a good example to your nieces and nephews, have fun and bond with them. Enjoy your childhood while it lasts and let the good things come in due time.", "Yta but then again i know its hard but at your age esp when female for at least few years you will behave batshit crazy i was stoopid all the way till 25 to the point of wondering how tf nobody strangled me and i managed to get old. Hormones and all that make us stupid. If possible if you dont trust in your siblings when using google to find something to validate your frustrations try to find why would they force something on you so for example instead of looking for how do i force my guardians to stop making me use bumper seat look for firstly bumper seat mandatory for what height ? ( Because maybe its law and noone wants a ticket ) and if that puts you in a clear look for safety reasons if that also puts you in a clear try to have a civil conversation about it and ask if not now then when ? What height do I have to be etc. You see, demanding things because YoU ArE nOt A cHiLd usually means you either are childish or entitled. Usually adults apply rules accordingly to your behaviour and maybe they deem you not grown up enough and most certainly, they seem reasonable. I'm sure they also have a hard time when you skip from home to home to accurately determine that but usually when someone says they aren't a kid- they are.", "It doesn't sound like you've had much in the way of parenting. You don't seem to know what normal parenting looks like. Believe it or not, it sounds like your siblings are doing a better job than your parents ever did. That said, you were an asshole to the babysitter.\n\nI think you need to ask yourself why they are keeping such a close eye on you. Everything you complained about is normal. Is your normal meter broken?", "Im not sure if you will read this, but I really hope you do. \n\nI bet that your siblings are a little overbearing. I bet you feel absolutely smothered by their constant control and demand for absolute authority. I bet you feel hurt by their lack of understanding for your need for independence. I bet its a major blow to your self esteem to be possibly the shortest kid in your class, and you feel as if your height is a constant source of negative attention. \n\n1. I agree that they do seem to be hovering a little too close. Things like being stuck in the kids room and needing a babysitter feels a little disrespectful to your autonomy at 13. With something like this, its important that you sit your siblings down and tell them you need a safe space to vent your emotions without interruption because you feel like youre suffocating. Tell them you would like the opportunity to at least prove them wrong, that youre learning about how a lack of identity and independence causes major depression, anxiety, and other emotional challenges for kids your age. \n\n2. You do need to recognize that you are still a kid. You should have more freedoms with being a teen, thats true, but many people will still think youre a kid until youre 25. Youre going to hate me for saying this, but you will know EXACTLY what I mean once youre in your late 20s / early 30s. I promise you, you will be treated like a kid until youre 26/27, just like the rest of us were. You WILL understand when youre older, you just have to gain that experience until then. Please dont stop reading here, I have just a little bit more left to say.\n\n3. Dont let your height define you, but also dont try to battle the things that help you because of it. Things like the chair and stuff, I know its embarrassing as I was also the last kid in my class to stop using the booster. If I ever got driven by other parents, I would have to ask them if they had a booster in their car (which most minivans in the 90s actually had boosters built into the seats so it wasnt a big deal) and then sit next to an actual child also in a booster. It sucked, but you need to understand that your safety is so much more important. Please please please dont fight it.\n\n4. Do challenge the rules placed around you, but still be respectful. I can tell that your family is treating you a little too delicately due to your height. Im sure its difficult for them to give you more space because they look at you and see this precious treasure that they need to keeep safe, but youre clearly showing signs of contempt which means that theyre becoming less parental and more oppressing. A child does naturally go through stages of rebellion, pushing boundaries and disregarding rules, but it shouldnt feel painful to the point of asking help from total strangers. People that post here tend to be unable to navigate major stress and need to be talked off a metaphorical ledge. Despite the torrent of emotions youre feeling, when you question the rules set in place, do it from a scholars point of view. Why is this rule in place? If for a reason, does that reason still exist presently? If a rule exists \"just because,\" then thats not enough of a reason. At the point your guardians try to force you into doing what they say \"because they said so,\" it is no longer for your safety and instead because they want total submission from you. Do some research on why \"because i said so,\" is damaging to a childs development, it will help in your conversations moving forward. \n\n5. If at any point someone laughs at you or dismisses you, simply let them know, \"I will remember this time where I reached out to you with an issue that is genuinely hurting me, hoping that you would try to understand me, and you instead laughed me off.\" You deserve mutual respect for your autonomy just like any other adult. Your voice should always be heard, just like any other adult. Just because you are young does not mean that you deserve to be treated as less than. You are ALWAYS deserving of a place to grow and feel heard. Your pain is valid, your anger is valid. But also remember that your siblings are just trying to do their best. Let them know that their best should include treating you like a human and not like a pet.\n\nY t a but also ESH.\nGood luck, OP.", "you have an iphone AND an ipad??????? That's maddening for me at least. And your siblings want to spend time with you? take you on vacations? AND make sure there's a babysitter to look after you?????\n\nyea, you are lucky. \n\nI think your issue is your sibblings treat you like their kid. You are a kid, but you don't want to be group into spending time with your nieces and nephews. Since you seem to break rules and also swear, i assume you're in your rebellious years. I empathize with you even under your bratty circumstances. \n\nIf you don't want to be treated like a kid, acting out is the opposite way of getting others to look at you not like a kid. Be calm, do well in school, talk nicely, sit down your sibblings and voice your frustration in a calming manner (no swearing). Or write them a letter to say how you feel and how you would like to be treated, or  at least come up with common grounds like: they can hang out with you without their kids, etc. Or negotiate more responsibility, you can even be a baby sitter to your nieces and nephews, they can pay you too. Show you're responsible and they will start looking at you in a different light. \n\nyou're NTA, but you are wrong to have treated some random baby sitter like that. You're reacting normally for a 13year old imo.", "Nah, you sound entitled but you\u2019re 13 so no ah for you.

If you are able to, you can request to stay in one or two of the houses. \n\nYou are still a kid but I think they should eventually loosen the grip on you when you\u2019re 13 or 14. The screen time sounds normal but I don\u2019t think you need any babysitting. I would be upset with the bunk bed as well at 13. If you speak to them, are they willing to listen?", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH just because where I live 12yr olds are babysitters. While obviously they needed a babysitter for the younger kids, lumping you completely in with them is obviously going to cause strife. No 13yr old wants to be watched by a stranger brush their teeth. I used to have an issue brushing my teeth as a child so my babysitter had to watch me, but I was maybe 8 and he was probably 14. He was also our regular babysitter so he wasn\u2019t a stranger to me. \n\nI will say that despite you being their sibling it does make the most sense to put you with the other children for rooming purposes. As adults they most likely paid for the trip, thus they get separate rooming privilege. \n\nRe the booster seat though, check the laws where you live. Where I live, it\u2019s you\u2019ve got to hit one of the milestones: be taller than 4\u20199, more than 80lbs, or older than 8yrs old. I used a booster seat till I was 12, but stopped at that age because while I hadn\u2019t hit the other two milestones, I\u2019d obviously hit the age one and getting to teen years in a booster seat could lead to bullying.", "NTA.

This is the age kids want a small measure of independence. They aren't letting her grow and she will start resenting them. She starts high school next year this is the age where a she needs to learn to be somewhat responsible for her own schedule. Strict parenting just makes for angry teens.

Or not taking your meds?[I know I was horrible about my meds at 13]) \n\nWhile I agree that you didn\u2019t need a babysitter in the most literal sense, you did need someone there to watch over you in a general sense in case something when wrong.  I had a regular babysitting job in Junior and Senior year of high school because my towns February break and the town next store (where my parents taught) were different weeks.  One of my parents coworkers lived in our town, had a 12 (and then 13) year old son.  He couldn\u2019t be left home alone but I was just there \u201cin case something happens\u201d. I spent a week watching tv with him, playing with his trains and in the yard.  And made some nice pocket money.  It was easy because he understood the rules his parents left for him and didn\u2019t push back.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how you\u2019ll convince your 4 guardians that you don\u2019t need to be watched.  You need to not push back on the completely reasonable rules they have for you.  Take your meds, drink your shakes and brush your teeth without being reminded.

They have prescribed medication that someone has to watch them take to make sure they take it. And, they have/must have a shake.\n\nThat's possibly not just a shake. That's potentially a nutrient shake given to patients with weight issues. I had to take them and they taste absolutely disgusting- but they have every calorie you need and all the vitamins. They can range from 350-500 calories and can substitute a meal.\n\nTeeth and height are physical attributes. OP could just be short and mention it because there's a reason to do so. They could've just had an issue with brushing their teeth. But, from personal experience, there are many reasons to avoid looking in a mirror. Bad dental hygiene can come with that.\n\nAnd then there's the prescribed medication that they have to be checked to see if they're taking. That only happens if someone's being over controlling or if you don't take medication.\n\nThis all very loosely comes together to infer that OP may have had an eating disorder because of how they perceived themselves, the shake is to help them get/stay healthy, and the prescription medication is for continuing treatment.\n\nAgain, my armchair diagnosis is what's going out on a limb.

Sounds like there\u2019s some rough history in the family, and I hope they\u2019re all getting help with therapy to support them.", "I do have a few concerns. Many children/teenagers struggling with splitting their time between two households. Being split between four, having to remember 4 different house rules, similar, but different rules is stressful for a teenager. As an adult, I can't imagine that. It's amazing that OP has 4 families that want to take care of them, but it should be one or two. \n\nAs for the booster seat, I get it. I also am a small person. I was in a booster seat until I was 11 years old because where I lived it was based on weight. The only reason my parents let me stop using the booster seat then was because my parents were driving me in a carpool and they heard my friends making fun of me for being in a booster seat. I started crying once my friends were out of the car, and said how I didn't want to do any activities anymore so that my parents wouldn't drive me and my friends anywhere. Technically, I should have been in a booster seat until the end of my freshman year of high school. It is extremely humiliating, it is technically the law, but it is a guardians decision. \n\nI am going to go ESH. Your siblings need to realize you need stability and consistency. But the person who posted above is right, your siblings are being good parents.", "I agree. But I will say I think it\u2019s detrimental to OP that they have to keep jumping between four households. I can imagine it\u2019s not easy having 4-8 different people you have to listen to as guardians and no stability in terms of one household only. I think that\u2019s the one thing they should really change.", ">they have parental controls on everything.  \n>  \n>Again, that is how it should be. Yes, even at 13. They are parenting you excellently.\n\nOne would argue *especially* at 13.", "My son is 15. He still sits in the back seat (6'1\"), no screen time until homework is done, and has a bed time. We still remind him of medical things. We wouldn't leave him with a babysitter now, but we might have at 13 if we were going to be out late. He is a mature, reasonable, cheerful kid, who mostly follows the rules.\n\nHe would never have complained about this stuff at 13, especially not about being bunked with the younger kids. He'd have enjoyed the opportunity to be the 'grownup cousin'.\n\nYour complaints tell me that you're not as mature as you think you are, and you've got a ways to go before the rules ease up. Figure out what's important to you (maybe, freedom from homework checking) and how to get it (complete homework without being asked for several months; keep getting homework done after checking is stopped), focus on that, and ignore the rest of it. It's good parenting for someone your age.", "I agree with most of your points here but they are on Vacation and OP is still told to go to bed at the same time as a school night. That is a little unfair. Her siblings have gone out and left her at home with her nieces and nephews but she isn't allowed screen time. That really isn't much of a vacation.", "Even by the most conservative standards, 13 is too old for a booster seat.

Ditto parental controls), or are necessary, but can be more infantilizing than it needs to be depending on how it's treated (booster seat. Having a babysitter when there are also younger kids who definitely needed one.)\n\nOverall, it feels like OP thinks she's much more grown up than she actually is AND her siblings maybe haven't really realized she's hitting a new life stage and will need to gradually gain more independence from now on.

I was around one for the first time in a long time and my God I forgot how condescending and know it all they are lol.", "It sounds like OP is more slowly physically developing though. Most teens aren't required to drink a certain shake which leads me to believe there were some issues with nutrition. This could also explain the booster seat as well.

You can\u2019t teach kids to be responsible without allowing them to be responsible for things. They need to experience natural consequences like poor grades; 13 is a great age to fail a class. There\u2019s time to make it up and colleges don\u2019t care if you were a slacker in middle school. A 13-year-old doesn\u2019t need a babysitter or a 9:30 bedtime. Staying up watching TV while ON VACATION is not super rebellious. \n\nOP should ask them for a trial run of a few days.

Also, at 13, kids shouldn't be left home alone. Even at 10 they shouldn't, what happens in the event of an emergency? A 13 year old can't do jack shit like a 16 year old that can drive can. ANYONE who thinks a CHILD under 16 should be baby sitting or staying home alone is irresponsible as hell and obviously not using their brain.

I was 13 once too and hated adults bossing me around, but what solution do you propose? If OP won't take her meds or brush her teeth without supervision, what do you suggest? If OP is mature enough to understand that medication and hygiene are important then she *should* be mature enough to take care of those things without help. If she's not mature enough to understand their importance, then she needs help making sure they get done. Again, that's not a failing, it's just part of being a child. And the supervision is not a punishment, it's *support*.\n\nAlso, \"strict\" is not inherently a bad thing. Some kids need strict sometimes, and OP clearly needs strict right now. Kids that don't follow rules get support to help them follow the rules, and consequences to show them what happens when they don't. That's not some kind of cruel and unusual punishment, it's just basic parenting."]}
