The rules get relaxed when you can show that you're responsible for yourself. The more you act like a petulant child, the more the rules are going to stay around.\n\nNo screens until your homework is all done is a completely normal rule that a lot of parents have for their teens. Having a set bedtime is a completely normal rule that a lot of parents have.

Want to be treated as more mature? Act more mature and start a normal adult conversation about it. And honestly the only rule I'd see viable as being tweaked a bit is bedtime rule.

Because if not, then they are going to keep babying you.", "NAH \n\n\"They all treat me like a little kid.\"\n\nYou are 13. I know you feel older and wiser but I promise you, you are still a child. You're not an asshole because you're 13 and literally every 13 year old feels this way. Your siblings aren't assholes because all of their rules sound pretty age appropriate and/or based on extenuating circumstances for you specifically.\n\nI don't know why you have ended up with your siblings raising you, but it sounds like they love and care for you well. I think it would be fair to discuss with them that you are getting older and want a little more freedom, but don't expect that to necessarily come in the form of more screen time, and don't expect anything if you are acting out all the time and telling people to \"fuck off.\"", "A soft YTA from a past over-controlled child. Your siblings are infantilizing you a bit, but not as much as you would think. My mom didn\u2019t get me a phone or have a TV until I was in highschool, and yes it was embarrassing. Yes I felt ready for so much more. But looking back? I\u2019m so glad she did. I\u2019m the only person in my social circle I know that\u2019s not addicted to my phone. Being enforced to do daily hygiene habits is sadly not the average, and your siblings are making sure you learn those good practices before you live by yourself and aren\u2019t enforced to. Yes it sucks right now, and it\u2019s so hard to understand from your POV, but try to appreciate what your siblings are trying to do for you. And let yourself be a kid! God knows so many of us miss it lol- be silly with your niblings and be kind to the babysitter (it\u2019s not their fault). \n\nAnd if that\u2019s too much, at least at first, speak in a way your siblings will try to understand. \u201cI\u2019m upset with this situation, and I\u2019m going to keep to myself this evening.\u201d Or \u201call my friends are allowed to do this, and I\u2019m feeling really left out.

You're 13, still a child and as such have to follow rules. I'm sorry you don't like them but that's life and they have reasons for the rules. You are also short, I am as well, and your state probably has laws about heights in cars, as mine does, and I had to use a seat until I was 10. They are keeping you safe in a large vehicle.

From your post, It sounds to me, that you still need a babysitter.", "YTA just because they are your siblings does not mean you are equal in age to them. They are adults and you are a child. They know what's best for you. You do not. There are reasons all through your post that show why you should be treated like this but since you are a child you don't see it. my hope for you is that as you get older you appreciate what they are doing for you rather than resent being treated age appropriate by them. Also think about this, if they weren't taking care of you where would you be? what kind of situation would you be in? do you really think it would be better? If you do maybe you need to talk to a few foster, adopted and homeless kids to truly see that you are being treated very good.", "They love you enough to coordinate on care and life choices, good people, good parents. It suckss but you should just comply and be happy so many people love you that much.", "YTA. Also, behaving that way is not going to convince them that you are mature enough to start to make those sorts of choices for yourself.\n\nIt's fine to feel frustrated about some of the rules, but the more adult, and likely more effective way, to get them to change is to show that you are mature enough to let them relax the rules a bit. \n\nIt's not inherently unreasonable for them to put limits on you screen time or to require that you do your homework first. It's not unreasonable for them to want you to be safe ion their vehicles . it's not unreasonable to have a bedtime .\n\nIgnoring their rules and refusing to do as the sitter said doesn't show them that you are old enough to decide for yourself, it just makes you look like a petulant child.\n\nSit down and talk to them. Explain that the rules feel very restrictive and that you feel they treat you like a much younger child.\n\nAsk that they stop supervising you in cleaning your teeth, that you are allowed a later bedtime , at least on days when you don't have school in the morning.  In relation to the car, it depends on the rules where you are, maybe do some research into the safety guidance and show that to them, to ask that they stop making you use the booster seat and that they allow you to sit in the front sometimes . Listen to what they say and why they don't agree, if they don't - maybe they will want to set some conditions of things that you need to do in order for their rules to be relaxed -listen to what they say and follow through.", "NAH\n\nyou are still a child, you are only 13.

That must be awful for you to be so cherished.", ">They all treat me like a little kid\n\nYou *are* a kid.  You\u2019re 13: you\u2019re *supposed* to have a bedtime.

Nothing you listed is unreasonable and they absolutely have the authority to decide whether or not you need a sitter. And your action didn't earn you any additional privileges, they just proved that you need a sitter.", "Light YTA.\n\nIt's hard to be bossed around by siblings. You're getting to a point where you need a bit more freedom, and you're feeling like your siblings are treating you like their kid instead of their sister. The best way to demonstrate you're maturing is to act that way. My younger sister is 40, and is 4'10. She fights to be taken seriously by most adults in her life. I get that it's hard, but at 13, you still need some parenting. Maybe sit down with your siblings and make a case for some more freedoms. Explain your feelings, and have a talk about the things you're struggling with most.", "NAH. \n\nYou're at a very tough stage in life. You're barely done being a child, and you're not quite a full fledged teen. Plus, physical development is vastly different around this age - I bet you have some kids in class who could pass for grade school kids and some that could pass for Jr's in high school. \n\nThe really tough spot you're in is that you more closely fit the kids than the people 28 years old and above. If there aren't tweens or other people your age, you're going to be lumped in with the kids. \n\nSit them down and update expectations. I guarantee that you're seeing maturity in yourself that is easily missed or forgotten by them.

The more maturely you approach the issue the better.", "I know it\u2019s really hard to understand when you\u2019re a young teen what good parenting looks like. The sad ugly truth is that good parenting is way in the minority. It might not seem fair because other teens might be parented differently, but the real talk is that other teens really should be parented how your siblings are parenting you.

You need to be 4 foot 9 inches and a minimum weight, I think.  My older kids were so happy when they finally qualified not to need a booster. But she isn't there yet. I know the teen years are bratty. My 12 year old is the queen of snark, but the OP is being ridiculous.", "Depends on the kid, and on the time that school starts. But in general, 9:30 is a completely normal time for lights out for a 13 year old. Typical 13 year olds need around 9-11 hours sleep per night. Around here, middle schools start at 8, so a 13 year old would need to wake at 7 at the latest.\n\nLights out at 9:30 would give her 9.5 hours of sleep, which is completely normal and necessary for a typical child of her age.", "nothing about what op is dealing with strikes me as strict for a 13 year old.", "Maybe it's insulting, but with their height a booster seat is legally required in a lot of regions. There are even adult little people who use booster seats in cars, that has nothing to do with age, but with height.", "Booster seats are based on a ratio of height/weight. I don't know what country you're in, but in the US, a child must be at least 4 foot 9 before they are legally allowed to not use a booster anymore.", "13 years old is a child.", "One way to prove that OP is maturing and growing is following the rules and not acting like an entitled brat when asked to do normal things, like take medication and brush their teeth.", "spoken like someone without kids. having a bedtime, restrictions on screen time without checking homework, and parental controls on TV and internet are common for 13 year old kids, and should frankly be required of all parents. the only point op might have is being old enough to not need a babysitter, though their attitude does not reflect that.", "Thank you", "Presumably OPs parents are unavailable. Seems the sibs are doing an excellent job of filling their role", "nothing? this is exactly how parenting a 13 year old should be.", "Found another 13-year-old!", "A lot of stuff", "Sounds more like a dead parents thing", "Just because one of them doesn't make you doesn't mean it's legal. That's not how laws work.", "or your brother is being irresponsible", "Come on, you're just picking and choosing whatever you want to believe with that (i.e. one brother doesn't make you use the booster seat, so it must be 'legal'. That makes no sense, as it's only 1 sibling vs. the other 3. Why is only one sibling more likely to be right, instead of SEVERAL siblings?)\n\nGo and research the law in your state. If it's legal to skip the booster seat, that gives you more ammo to argue your point. But picking whatever 'truth' you want to believe - just because it suits what you want - will not convince anybody of your maturity.", "You clearly have internet access.  Why don't you take a few moments and actually research the question instead of just believing what you want to believe?  I'd say that'd be the adult thing to do.", "Many people don\u2019t wear seat belts, does not mean it isn\u2019t illegal", "I'm 58, mostly retired, and I **love** going to bed at 9:30!", "Currently in a pretty severe depression so my biorythm is out of whack. But I used to go to bed at 10 at the latest because I'd wake up at 6 with and without an alarm. And I need my 8 hours to be functional. I can do later, but that shows itself in a foul mood and less concentration the next day so only done on weekends when there is something like a family party during the holidays.", "Just 1 nuance- the age 8 actually matters for the booster because of body development, and no one would enforce it for a child over 8 as a result. At 13, OP is less fragile developmentally than an 8 year old. That's why boosters aren't recommended for adults under 4 foot 9. \n\nBeing 13 would make not using a booster legal in most states. 12 and under is the rule for the front seat. A smaller 13, you can argue its prudent for the backseat sitting.", "Guardians.  Your statement just proved mine btw.", "What would you rather your living situation be? Genuinely asking.", "Who did you want to live with?", "You need a court appointed advocate for yourself which will make your choices clear. Who do you want to live with? That should be the priority.", "Not exactly missed, but not relevant to the question of OP if she was an AH for telling her babysitter to fuck off. No matter the context, swearing at someone who has done nothing wrong (they are being paid to babysit multiple children not just OP) is not ok, whether they are a child or an adult who does it.", "Honestly forgot that getting up early for school was a thing. On weekends and vacation, I still think 9:30 is too early.", "Dad still impregnated a younger woman after mom died...", "I was about to reply essentially the same thing. OP is a young teen, wants to be treated as an adult, but doesn\u2019t behave responsibly as an adult should.", "I'm 27 and pregnant, and happily waddled myself to bed at 7:45 this weekend! \ud83d\ude02", "I still need a babysitter because I won\u2019t call them my parents?", "Perhaps this depends on how easily you adjust schedules. I think we all agree that the typical teen body clock would prefer to stay up until midnight, and get up for lunch the next day. But if you've got to get up at 6.30 or 7 on Monday, there's a limit to how late many people can reasonably get up on Sunday...\n\nAs for vacations, I think I'd distinguish between \"hanging around at home\" school vacations, and traveling somewhere as a tourist. If you're just hanging out at home, then waking late is reasonable. If you're doing the tourist thing with family, then you still have a schedule - you need to wake in the morning so you can get to the museum / other tourist activity when it opens. Given that this was on a family trip with a bunch of little kids who can be guaranteed to wake early, imposing an early bedtime on the teen seems sort of reasonable.", "Yikes. And threw you out?\nWow. That sucks.\n\nSo... be grateful your sibs have your back.\n\nThey are not \"controlling\" they are *responsible*.", "Congratulations on both counts!  I can't imagine how exhausting just *being* pregnant must be.", " No, because they are legally your guardians and responsible for you.", "No", "no, you still need a babysitter because you are 13. you are a child, much as you might want yo pretend otherwise. you shouldn't be in such a hurry to grow up. it's not all that exciting", "No other 13 year olds have babysitters", "I had a babysitter at 13.  It was chill.  Honestly, kinda miss having someone to make mac and cheese and tell me its time for bed.", "that's just blatantly untrue. maybe no other 13 year old that you know of personally has a babysitter, but its not uncommon.  look, you can have a discussion with them about treating you a bit more like an adult, but I also don't think a lot of their rules are extreme for someone your age. you do not need unfettered access to the TV and internet. that's extremely dangerous for someone your age, and having a curfew is very common too, as is them making sure your homework is done.", "How do you know for sure? Did you ask every single 13 year old if they have a babysitter?\n\nLook, there are some parents/guardians that think 13 is old enough to be at home alome and some that think differently. There's no real guidelines on stuff like that-your siblings are just making the best decisions they can, and they're doing so out of love and care for you, not bc they want you to suffer out of apite or something. \n\nYour siblings are acting like your parents bc you don't have any, so *someone* has to. And parents set reasonable rules for their kids. It's pretty common for teens to hate rules, but we all had to follow them. Most of the rules are there for a good reason-of course guardians/parents are going to prioritize you focusing on getting decent grades and maintaining a good balance of school/personal life. And parental controls, as annoying as they are, are there to protect you from coming across some dangerous sites. Take it from someone who grew up when smartphones were just being introduced: I was exposed to a lot of stuff I shouldn't have been bc my mom had no idea what I was capable of finding on the internet."]}
