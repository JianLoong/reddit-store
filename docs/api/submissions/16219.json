Seriously there are scholarships for everything, hell even duct tape used to do one if you went to prom is a duct tape made outfit. Not saying they offered a full ride or $50k\u2026. but if this school is so important she\u2019s willing to bankrupt her own sibling maybe it warrants trying a lllliiittttttllllleeee harder than \u201cwelp, that one didn\u2019t work out sis gimme your entire life savings\u201d", "Nta why in the world would be expected a *sibling* to pay her tution?

Just because you probably filled the role of a parent in her eyes does not mean that you have to mortgage your future to get her started on her own.  \n\nShe needs to apply for financial aid and loans.

Let her look into community colleges and state schools to figure out how to get a college education with the least possible debt.\nETA\nWhy on earth would you consider chipping in for her tuition when you have your own education debt? She\u2019s becoming an adult, taking care of you own problems us part of adulting. And people need to stop wit( this this \u201cfamily helps family\u201d bs.

What about loans?", "Exactly this.\n\nAnd she can also take out loans like everyone else who needs to.", "She needs to apply for financial aid. Maybe even defer acceptance for a year to work and save up. If you\u2019re from the US, I would recommend that she tutors SAT prep because she can charge like $50 per hour. If she also has a regular entry level job she might be able to save a decent chunk of tuition.", "NTA but a good solution is for your sister to go to a community college near the school and then transfer to the school after 2 years.

Also, yes of course family should help (or more accurately, people who care for each other should help each other), but that means making sure people have a roof over their head, food to eat, and access to opportunities where there is a connection. \n\nYour sister can take out loans, your sister can choose a different school. She will not be poor, or hungry, or homeless if you do not pay her tuition. \n\nI think you should simply tell your sister that you do not have that kind of money, end of story. Tell her you have your own bills to pay- don't bother mentioning savings- and that you do not have $50k, so just as she could not give you $50k right now, you can't give it to her. Yes, family helps, and if you had that kind of money, you would give it to her, but you don't. \n\nDon't get in to how much you make, what you are saving for, anything like that. Your money is your business and she doesn't need to know. You don't have the money, and you don't need to explain beyond that.", "NTA - she can take out loans like the rest of us.  If she chooses a dumb major that won't allow her to earn enough to pay them off, that is on her.  That is a hard pill to swallow for some people.", "NTA - She needs to figure out how to pay for it if that is how she really wants to go.

That is life, unfortunately, you have to make decisions based on what you can do.", "NTA\n\nJust say no. Don't allow anyone to guilt you in to it.", "I assume your sister has no plans to provide you with any financial assistance in the future. I also assume that she has not offered to sign a note, obligating her to repay you this very substantial amount of money.  \n\nYour sister\u2019s request is selfish, and she\u2019s trying to guilt you into giving her money you don\u2019t have. That\u2019s not a very nice sibling. She should be concerned about you and your financial position, which she clearly is not. \n\nYour sister\u2019s perspective is all about her.

Why can't she?\n\nShe is unreasonable and the selfish one. You are not a plus parent just because of the age difference.", "Nta\n\nHigh schools need to do a better job showing the kind of debt that comes with college. \n\n\nIt is an unfortunate part of the US. However, if she wants an expensive university, take out a loan. \n\n\nThere are only a few occupations where the school itself matters. Otherwise, you're just overpaying for college.", "NTA. It\u2019s fine to ask for help, though asking for what she did is pretty outrageous unless you just hit the Powerball or something. You don\u2019t owe her this, especially not while still paying off your own student loans!", "What\u2019s her intended major? Just wondering. Very small chance the return on investment will be there, tbh. She can get a good education within her means at a LOT of universities. She\u2019s being totally unreasonable here, imo. One of my kids wanted to apply to a very expensive out of state private college. We had a talk about the costs and that merit aid wasn\u2019t offered there at all. I was happy to have her apply but let her know $70k a year wasn\u2019t happening. She ended up in state at a public university with two scholarships that covered housing and room and board. Graduating without going into debt is HUGE these days. There\u2019s no sane reason to dig a financial hole that you and she will likely never dig out of if there are options on the table.

Look after your own future.  Even worse is her expectation that you would pay for her while you yourself are paying off debt.", "NTA. You say you have student loans: has she contributed to 50% of your student loans/tuition? If the answer is no (as I suspect), then maybe point that out. If family is meant to help each other out, why isn't she helping you with your education costs? \n\nOf course, the real AH is the system, which means that education costs $100,000!", "Wait are you saying it\u2019s 100k per year??? For 4 years? Absolutely not", "NTA. Where are your parents to help her out? Not your responsibility to pay for her education. She can get student loans, just like you did.", "NTA. You have your own student loans to deal with and you are in no way expected to have to pay for her tuition. \n\nBut what you can do is help her navigate the student loan process and help her to apply to as many individual scholarships as possible.

It's unfortunate, but if she *really* wants to go to that university and will be going for a degree that has the potential to earn a lot of money, she can take loans out.
