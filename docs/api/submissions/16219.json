If you reasonably could help her, you probably would. This is kind of the effect of nobody paying fornyou college, so you can't pay for hers. This should make sense to her.

You can't afford it and you already have your own student loan to pay for and your won future to plan for. If the cost of the tuition is out of reach, she needs to look into other options.", "You're not her parent and not responsible for her tuition.\n\nIf she can't afford it, she should attend somewhere with lower tuition.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  That's pretty weird that she'd expect you to say yes.  A sibling isn't obligated to provide support.", "NTA\n\nShe's not your child, she's not your responsibility.\n\nIt is sad and awful that she won't get to go, but that's the shitty system, not your fault. I don't blame her for asking, or for being disappointed when you refused, but I do blame her for giving you a hard time about it. Fucksake you are barely better off than a student yourself.", "NTA - Her saying she would do this for you is meaningless, because she will never be in that position. \n\nYou do not need to put your own financial goals on hold to pay for your sister's education.", "NTA. She's an adult. The financial responsibility for her college education is entirely hers.", "NTA. You cannot light yourself (and in this case your hard earned savings) to keep someone else warm. But more importantly- she applied for ONE scholarship and now wants your help? That\u2019s so little effort it\u2019s laughable. Seriously there are scholarships for everything, hell even duct tape used to do one if you went to prom is a duct tape made outfit. Not saying they offered a full ride or $50k\u2026. but if this school is so important she\u2019s willing to bankrupt her own sibling maybe it warrants trying a lllliiittttttllllleeee harder than \u201cwelp, that one didn\u2019t work out sis gimme your entire life savings\u201d", "Nta why in the world would be expected a *sibling* to pay her tution?  She can take out loans, *just like you did* or go to a cheaper school.", "NTA. Like you said it is not your responsibility. You have your own life, responsibilities and goals you need to put first. If it is within your budget you can offer money for books as a way to help in a reasonable way.\n\n\nIt's great she got accepted to the school but if she can't afford it she shouldn't go. Has she really gone through the whole financial assistance process? She needs to spend time going over her situation with the school's financial aid office first.", "NTA\n It isn't your kid, do not take on extra debt for it.", "NTA\n\nYou are not at a stage in life where you can sacrifice your own financial stability and future because you sister is returning to go to a university she can't afford.\n\nYou are not her parent. \n\nYou absolutely do not have to split costs with her, nor are you being unreasonable or a bad family member by refusing to do so.", "NTA. Just because you probably filled the role of a parent in her eyes does not mean that you have to mortgage your future to get her started on her own.  \n\nShe needs to apply for financial aid and loans. And, if she can't make it work this year, perhaps she can push pause for a year to work on getting money for school.", "NTA if she wants to go to this school she is the one that needs to make the sacrifices. If she doesn\u2019t want to then maybe she needs to go to a cheaper school.\n\nYou have worked your way through school and have your own student loans it isn\u2019t reasonable that she thinks you should pay this amount.\n\nMake sure all of your personal information. Social security cards and banking info is locked up. She has already expressed she is entitled to your money because she is family.", "Me being ah sister \"did you pay for my tuition? Nah, so I'm not paying for yours\" \ud83d\ude14", "NTA\n\nShe applied to a prestigues, probably expensive, university knowing that the price would be high, a scholarship is not something you can bet your entire life on.  \nDid she have any other universities she got into that might be cheaper? If so, she can go to one of those and not act entitled to other people's money", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to set yourself on fire to keep others warm, esp in a situation like this. She needs to call mom, dad, or get a loan. This is not your job!", "NTA you have no responsibility to cover the costs and what she is asking for is so much money! You clearly took out loans for your education which you are paying off whilst saving  and by the sounds of it she will need to do the same. She can not expect you to put your life on hold to pay for her future.", "NTA\nIf she couldn\u2019t get a scholarship and there is no college fund she doesn\u2019t need to go to that school. You are still trying to get your life in order, paying 50k a year towards he4 college is not a reasonable request. Let her look into community colleges and state schools to figure out how to get a college education with the least possible debt.\nETA\nWhy on earth would you consider chipping in for her tuition when you have your own education debt? She\u2019s becoming an adult, taking care of you own problems us part of adulting. And people need to stop wit( this this \u201cfamily helps family\u201d bs. We aren\u2019t talking about a day of baby sitting or chipping in on prom dress.", "NTA. That\u2019s a lot to ask. If she was asking to borrow it and had a plan to pay it back when she graduates.. that is a different story.", "NTA. If she wants to go to college, she can find her own way. Go to a community college and transfer. Work while in school. Take out loans.\n\nMany of us have done it.", "Why can't she take out loans?\n\nNTA", "She applied for \u201cA\u201d scholarship? She should be out there submitting applications to anything she potentially qualifies for there. There are databases out there she can check and spend two hours each day submitting applications. NTA she needs to step up and do her part if she wants this school.", "NTA .. She's not your responsibility and she's choosing to go to a school she can't afford. It's one thing to offer money now and then, I love delighting my nephew with a smallish financial gift when I know his tuition is due but what she's asking is totally unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nWhat's going on with your mom that she is not helping your sister? What about loans?", "Exactly this.\n\nAnd she can also take out loans like everyone else who needs to."]}
