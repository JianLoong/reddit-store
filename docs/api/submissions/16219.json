This would have involved filling out the FAFSA and the schools' own set of forms.  \n\nSecond, is the school meeting demonstrated need?  This is the term the FAFSA uses to report how much a family should be expected to pay each year.  You can look at the school's financial aid web site to see how well the school does at meeting demonstrated need.  e.g. Tufts University meets [\"100% of demonstrated need for all admitted undergraduates\"](https://www.tufts.edu/admissions/financial-aid).  The vast majority of \"prestigious universities\" will meet 100% need.\n\nYour sister and/or mother should call the financial aid office, the admissions officer who she worked with and anyone else at the university who she met while interviewing, touring, etc. and tell them that you would love to come but cannot afford the price tag.  If the school is meeting demonstrated need, be prepared to tell them why that is not enough.  Schools are used to hearing about extraordinary circumstances and have the flexibility to modify financial aid offers.  An admissions counselor will probably be willing to call the financial aid office to help support your case.  A professor will probably also be willing.\n\nThis works.  I went from a 50% scholarship for grad school to 100% with one 1 minute phone call.  My daughter's costs after financial aid went from $37,000 to $12,000 with two 20 minute phone calls.  A former student of mine, whose father was a multimillionaire but a deadbeat who refused to pay any expenses for his child, ended up with a free ride because her social worker mother met the standard at Tufts for full financial aid.\n\nIf, on the odd chance she has not filled out the financial aid forms then it may not be too late.  If it is too late, consider deferring admission a year so that she can apply for financial aid on time.

There is a term for this called \"forced solidarity\"\n\nTo the financially uneducated, money in the bank is \u201cjust sitting there doing nothing\u201d so it seems perfectly reasonable to demand it be shared.\n\nIn some countries, people have to actively hide savings from their relatives.  \u201cFrom field observations of credit cooperatives in Cameroon, we find that 19% of the loans taken are fully collateralized by savings held in the same institutions. This behavior is costly to the borrower, as it represents a net interest payment of about 24% per year\u2026interviews with members of the cooperatives suggest the following new rationale: *members resort to borrowing to signal to friends and relatives that they are poor and do not have savings available. By doing so, they can avoid requests for financial help. * Individuals, who took loans fully collateralized by their savings, claim that they use loan repayments as an excuse to oppose demands for money made by friends or family. One member summarizes it as follows: \u201cWhen I take a loan from my savings, my children and my wife think I have no money. I do it on purpose. If I simply withdraw my money, it will end, so I tell them that I borrowed. Then, when one complains he has a problem, I say I have to pay back my loan. It protects me from my children\u2019s demands.\u201d While taking a loan may seem an expensive mechanism to escape solidarity obligations, it needs to be examined in light of the African context. Social pressure for interpersonal redistribution in the form of cash transfers is high in Africa (Platteau (2000)) and several studies reveal a large demand for hidden or protected saving (Miracle et al., 1980). Anderson and Baland (2002) for example show that the need to protect savings from their husbands triggers women\u2019s participation in Roscas in a Kenyan slum. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227629940_Pretending_to_Be_Poor_Borrowing_to_Escape_Forced_Solidarity_in_Cameroon", "NTA", "NTA\nThat is an incredibly large amount of money and it's not your responsibility to foot the bill.

I think teachers and professors fail kids by not helping them connect with their parents earlier over realistic college lists in, like, 9th grade at the latest, because that's when many kids start dreaming of college, if not earlier (instead, 18/19 yr olds are blindsided senior year or later about the impossibility of attending a school they may have had their hopes set on for near half their life). \n\nOptions to reduce college costs are almost never discussed, like the double enrollment programs in many highshcools that allow students to go to community college for free, and graduate at 18 with two years of school already under their belt. Instead, kids are told right when they expect to move onto a shiny new campus that they can save money by spending two years commuting to a cc instead, and watch their friends go off to dream private schools from the sidelines.\n\nKids are told to follow their interests and passions, and then also fed a lot of info from the media, anecdotally, and maybe even from college marketing that prestigious schools are their best ticket to good paying careers... paradoxically, particularly if they are looking to study a passion subject that is not super in demand.  Studying sociology at a state school will land you working as an administrative assistant, but if you study it at Harvard? Somebody at corporate consulting or in product management or the FBI is going to see Harvard and not care it's a sociology degree (facts I've seen play out, to speak of anecdotes).  But then when kids explain rather meticulous logic to their sources of funding (parents or, ahem, sister), they're told they're crazy. Maybe they are, but it's not fair that they've been fed other information for so many years and are expected to just pivot on a dime to thinking more \"reasonably\". \n\nIt's possible there are still institutional sources of help out there for your sister.  Can she call the school and explain her situation? She applied for financial aid right? How much is Mom contributing? Can they write an appeal because of deadbeat father? \n\nCan she defer admission, continue taking CC classes, and work with a college counselor so that she can discover if there are schools out there that she'd be a better match for a scholarship for, but that are still prestigious? She can also take the time to figure out what other scholarships not offered through the university she may qualify for? Work her butt off as a waitress at a swanky place and pull in 60k that way, instead of out of your pocket?  \n\nIf there's a concern about her career path not \"paying off\", can someone help her explore majors and skillsets that will be in a lot of demand, and that may help pay off loans after the fact or even take the pressure off her from feeling like she has to go to a prestigious school at all? \n\nIt sucks to be 19 and deferring admission to university for another year. But it's better for her to go into her undergrad without bitterness, knowing she explored all her options and had support in doing so\n\nAs a sister, it's totally reasonable to say that 50k is off the table (you are still paying off your own school loans, saving for emergencies and retirement, maybe your own future kids so they can at least afford a state school, you are a nurse not a millionaire, and you've chosen a career that is lucrative and stable regardless of the prestige of your undergrad FOR A REASON).  I hope that you can convey that AND all the other advice you deem worthy from this comment or others to her.

She doesn't understand the value of money. I was in a similar position to your sister, we were struggling financially and I was accepted to my dream school (private and out of state) and parents told me they couldn't afford it. As a self-absorbed teenager, I was angry, threw fits, the works. Eventually, I went to public school in state on scholarship instead. At the end of the day, the name of the school on my diploma is completely irrelevant and I graduated debt free, which has been an enormous financial advantage.", "NTA. You took out loans but she can\u2019t?", "YOU are paying off student loans.  Why can't she get a loan?", "Do we know for sure that the sister won\u2019t be able to go if OP can\u2019t help her?

And if she\u2019s just going to have to eventually transfer somewhere else because she can\u2019t afford to stay at the top school four years, she\u2019s just throwing away that year of money because her degree won\u2019t be coming from that school.", "ivies don't do scholarships either. tho obviously 3rd party scholarships would be possible", "wtf? it's the parents role to help their child's education.", "several schools are over $100k/yr and have been for quite a while", "If she receives, hyperbolically, a dollar of support, or can\u2019t prove she gets no support, at that point it\u2019s a waste of time an energy that could go into finding real solutions.", "Oh well as a parent of kids in college, I agree with that 100 percent.   That said, co-signing loans above federal levels puts a young person who likely has no clue how that will affect their life is a bad idea.   It can also affect your financial future as a co-sign.   Never co-sign for something you can\u2019t easily pay.   \n\nParents should help guide their kids to options that are affordable for their budget keeping student debt levels as low as possible.

OTOH confirmation bias and motivated reasoning are a hell of a drug.", "I mean, getting a credit card at 18 is not inherently bad. My parents insisted I do so, and taught me how to use it - for online purchases because it\u2019s safer than using a debit card online, and only buying what I can afford to pay off that month. I kept an excel spreadsheet and had to update them monthly on what I spent and showing that I paid it off (as a condition for then paying for my room, board, and an allowance since a scholarship covered my tuition) and as a result I only accrued debt once in my life (in grad school, couldn\u2019t earn enough with one job and had to quit my second job when I couldn\u2019t juggle class, my thesis and two jobs) and they helped me pay it off when I graduated.

In California, you are guaranteed a spot in one of the prestigious four year schools if you do two years at a community college which makes it even more affordable. You do the basics at a community and then go to one of the universities for your major where it really matters.\n\nI am not talking through my hat. I went to one of the SUNY schools and then went to a Top Ten law school and graduated without student debt. Yes I had parents who helped me but they wouldn't have given me enough to graduate from a $60,000 a year college but it was within their means to essentially pay for my SUNY education costs and I was quite lucky with tuition for law school as well", "NTA... if you owe money, you are not in a position to lend money.", "NTA. It is definitely not your responsibility to pay for her college tuition.  She needs to work it out on her own.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t her mother.

Sister sure is though.", "Honestly posts like this confuse me. NTA. Why would that ever be your responsibility? It\u2019s awesome that she got into the school, but she didn\u2019t get the scholarship so that shouldn\u2019t fall on you. She should either 1) apply for more scholarships or 2) different school, community colleges are a great option.", "This isn\u2019t a ride to the airport, the ask is your down payment. Completely unreasonable. Hard NTA.", "Nta. Not that you need to explain,  but I would tell her you're still paying for your school,  you don't have money for hers. She can either go to a lower cost school or work to pay for the school she wants to go to. It's her choice to go to a school thst expensive,  it's not a necessity.", "NTA, but it also sounds extremely made up. Your dad still pays child support, despite the fact that neither of you are children? And you have a full time job as a nurse?", "NTA. This is not your problem.

Unless you left out the part where you have an older sibling who in fact gave you $50k to pursue your higher education dreams and how it is your turn to pay it forward, she is being unreasonable in her expectations. Being a good sibling does not mean giving her tens of thousands of dollars. Even if you had it to give.", "NTA.   I am a retired professor and would candidly say that only about 10% of students take it seriously.   She should try a local community college for two years.  If she thrives, a scholarship may be forthcoming.    A good student will thrive in any educational setting.   A bad student can retrench.   Does she have a plan?  She sounds like TA for asking so much.   Just say no.    I am sorry you are in this situation", "NTA.\nShe is choosing to go there so she needs to figure out how to pay or choose a different school.

Your sister is hella entitled. If she wants to go to that school, she can get loans and pay it herself, just like everybody else. There is absolutely NO reason for you to pay half her tuition.

I worked for multi-state, mid-size & smaller companies where managers weren't dazzled by a degree from a big name university, but not all companies are that way.  We also didn't look down on those who attended a community college before transfering to a university.  If anything, it showed they used their time and money wisely, weren't depending on mom or dad to support them while they found themselves, and they seemed to be the ones that were most likely to work while attending school.   \n\nJob postings are a description of the ideal candidate.
