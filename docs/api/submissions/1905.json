The mum then proceeded to scold me saying that I\u2019m a pathetic human for not letting a child feed the ducks and said what kind of adult feeds the ducks that only for children (this did hurt as I\u2019ve always loved feeding them and makes me happy).

She is the one who made it weird.", "NTA\n\nMom is an entitled A H and raising entitled A H children.", "NTA, whatsoever.   \n\n\nIf she wanted to come to the river, where there's potential to feed the ducks, then she should have thought ahead. That's what I do when I take my kids - or I'd at least check that I can buy some duck food there. Expecting someone else to give up theirs is just entitlement, and doesn't teach the children anything.", "NTA - As a parent I would never allow my children to act entitled to another person\u2019s property. I would gently let them know that we did not bring any duck food but next time we would. \n\nIf we were interacting with the individual that had duck food, I might give a questioning look  or ask if they mind sharing. If they choose not to share I\u2019d remind my children that they have special items they don\u2019t like to share so it\u2019s not right to expect a stranger to share with them.\n\nIf my kids continue to be upset and focused on the duck food, I would redirect them to a different area and attempt to get them engaged in a different activity. \n\nI would not tolerate entitled behavior and certainly not reinforce it.", "NTA, the audacity of reaching for your property without saying a word blows my mind. Also I'd advise against talking about how much you hate kids next time, it makes you look bad and it's irrelevant to the situation.", "NTA  VERY strongly! This parent was out of line. It could have been a teaching moment on their part. The mother was behaved horribly. As a duck owner, ducks are for everyone!! Guarantee they \u201cknow\u201d and appreciate your visits. I am sorry the mother, because she wanted to be a bully, made you feel bad.", "NTA A solid parenting move would have been \u201cThat belongs to somebody else, not to us\u201d or \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask politely if we can share the duck food?\u201d But no, this mother did neither. She grabbed for your property. That\u2019s not your fault, that\u2019s all on her.", "Nta there is a difference between asking nicely and going to just reach the bag that isnt ur property, lashes out on u because her kids cant get what they want", "NTA\n\nMom sounds quite entitled.\n\nThat said, I (44F) do a lot of wildlife rescue and rehab so I take any opportunity to educate kids and adults. \n\nSo in your situation, I would have talked about what are safe foods for ducks (like no bread) and what kind of ducks they are and so forth and shared a bit of the food.\n\n\nI\u2019m childfree by choice and I would have been pissed with the woman just assuming she could take my stuff. But it probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten that far with me as I seriously do take every opportunity to help people safely engage with nature.", "NTA at all! To start with you do not touch or try to take something that is not yours, every child should be taught that! That woman was being a shitty parent and example to her kids and then tried to gaslight you. \n\nIt was a moment of education for the children that the mother failed. She could have asked if they might have a small amount of the food to feed the ducks and if you had said no, it is a lesson that you don\u2019t get your way all the time and to come prepared next time.\n\nJust because you can have kids doesn't mean you should. This could have been a bad moment for the mom but it's the only moment we know of and she did a shit job.", "My 90 yo MIL fed ducks regularly that lived in a creek behind her house.   If they didn't see her at the back of the house they would go around the front and quack until she came out.  One would lay her eggs under the rose bushes next to the porch. \n\nIf anyone ever said she was too old for feeding ducks, there's a neighborhood full of folks that would put them in their place.", "NTA That\u2019s one entitled lady.", "NTA.\n\nWhat is it with parents who think their kid should have something just because they want it?\n\nYou brought the food, it's yours to share... with the ducks.", "Not in the slightest", "NTA.  Her lack of preparation does not mean this is your problem.  Demanding it just makes this worse.  Good grief, don't give it another thought OP.", "NTA she didn't even ask you first before reaching for it! Her kids are not your responsibility. She's the type of person that demands people move seats on a plane so her family can sit next to each other.", "NTA\n\nEntitled parents raise very entitled children.", "NTA. She should have brought her own and not have asked you at all. That being said, if the children were well-behaved and curious about the ducks, I might have shared with them while teaching them as much as I could on the subject or about the feeding. But that's just me and I like hanging out with children and don't believe they should be punished because of the bad choices of their parents.", "Nta, she reached for something from a stranger wothout asking then only asked after being a raging asshole about you preventing her from just taking. Really, even if she had asked politely first and you declined you wouldn't be the asshole here.", "YTA.

I know everyone will defend you and tell you mum is a horrible human being for not preparing her own duck food and how you are well within your technical rights to never share anything ever.

Sure, ideally mom would have woken up that morning 100% prepared for any potential wildlife encounters that day.

The mom was probably brought up in a barn. So it\u2019s only natural that she has no manners.", "NTA having children doesn\u2019t entitle you to every thing every one else has.

Your friends are not smart. They called you an AH for not bending to someone elses child\u2019s request? Um, how about if they want to feed the ducks, bring your own damn food. You did nothing wrong OP and honestly you handled this better than I would\u2019ve. Good on you for just walking away and leaving them without any of the duck food.\n\nAlso, feeding ducks and birds is so fun and relaxing. Fuck her for trying to claim its only for children. Do what you enjoy doing, OP.", "Were you obligated to share the duck food? No, absolutely not.\n\nShould you have shared the duck food with the kid? I think so, at least a few pieces.

Even if it would have been nice to let the kid feed the ducks, it would also give the kid a bad lesson - they can just take from other people if they want to. (I know this kid is 5 but still. Not too young to learn)\n\nMaybe if the mom didn\u2019t start off the interaction totally wrong by reaching for OP\u2019s duck food like she could just take it. That\u2019s crazy rude. Capitulate to that and the woman (and maybe even her kid) is just gonna go around thinking she can always get what she wants like that."]}
