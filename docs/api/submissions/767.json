B insists that the third window can never be opened while she's in class. The first window is right near the whiteboard and is constantly open. There are also four ventilator windows that are open at all times. The fourth window is right by the back desk of our row, which is also always open.\nI have sensory issues and extremely bright light and heat trigger migraines that don't go away for a couple of days, which is really inconvenient because the sunlight always lands right on my spot on the desk if the window I sit by is open. It's the beginning of summer where I live and it's extremely bright, shining off my notebook and hurting my eyes.\nB refuses to let us move the desks unless it's the back row, so I'm pretty much stuck there and can't even scoot over because there are two other kids who share my desk. She also insists that I open the window every time she comes in. I tried explaining that I can't because it'd bother me, and she'd make me open it anyway each time.\nToday, I was already in pain from all the noise in the class. B comes in, tells me to open the window (quite rudely might I add). I tell her that the sun bothers me, that it puts me in literal pain. She says open it. I say no. She says I either open it or get out, I choose the latter.\nLater, after the period ends, she tells me to never come to her class again. \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667336792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjle96/aita_for_refusing_to_open_a_window_when_my/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Additionally, you may be able to be allowed to wear sunglasses or similar shades, if you think it may help.
