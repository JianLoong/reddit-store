We went for a little trip to the next town over, and we got an Airbnb in the suburbs. It was just a small two bedroom house surrounded by other houses. It had a really nice big front deck that we would sit outside, eat dinner and drink on, and decent size kitchen and really modern renovated bathroom. The actual house was really nice. The problem was the neighbours, or more specifically the house across the road. When my girlfriend and I were out on the deck each night, a girl who lived in the house across the road was just sitting on her front door step. They didn\u2019t have a deck, she was just sitting on the step. Which is whatever, but she was smoking and laughing at her phone a lot, I also caught her looking up at us, I even had suspicions she was taking photos of us. It made me really uncomfortable but anytime I mentioned it to my girlfriend she shrugged it off and said to mind my business, so I did. A couple of days after we got home, my girlfriend was back at work so I decided to fill out a review for the AIRBNB we stayed at. I wrote all the pros about the house and there was a lot, but I did mention the girl across the road. I didn\u2019t go into much detail, I pretty much just said \u201cthere was a girl across from the house who would sit outside quiet frequently smoking which made me a bit uncomfortable, but besides that the place was perfect\u201d When my wife got home I mentioned to her that I filled out the review and I showed her, she got pretty upset. She said it was extremely rude to write about what someone else does in their own home, and said it\u2019s embarrassing for that \u2018poor girl\u2019, also said it wasn\u2019t fair to the AIRBNB owners because they only got 4 starts instead of the 5, when it was a 5 star stay. I can kind of see where she was coming from but I was just uncomfortable and wanted to express that in the review. I thought I would ask here to see what everyone thinks.\n\nEdit- wow i wasn\u2019t expecting so many people to disagree and I understand the rating system on AIRBNB now so I changed it to a five star. My wife is still pretty mad but she will get over it soon.

It's literally just another person, living her life that makes you uncomfortable? \n\nIf that's the case, and you have an issue with someone literally existing across the street, go to a hotel instead where you can complain about neighbors. You expressing your discomfort is alright, but in a review about a place that has nothing to do with the reason your upset is a little ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nSo a girl sits on her own doorstep chatting to her friend on the phone and every time she happens to glance up some creep in the house opposite is staring at her.

If the stay was truly five stars otherwise, I would not punish the owners (and the system is pretty brutal, they do suffer if they get four star ratings) just because their neighbour creeped you out - it's not in the owner's control.

It likely has already cost them some business. \n\nThere was a girl sitting across the street that made you uncomfortable. What does that have to do with the Airbnb host?

You're basically punishing the owners for having their Airbnb in an actual neighbourhood with actual people living there. Unless there was a rule \"no smoking allowed by ANYONE in a 0.5 mile radius\" you have no reason to complain about it. It's also okay for people to sit in front of their houses, yes, really.", "YTA. If it was a 5/5 stay, rate it as such. It isn't anyone's fault that the neighbor from across was making you uncomfortable (and your girlfriend is right, this person is allowed to do what she wants on her own home, as long as it's legal). Something like that doesn't belong in a review. If anything this should have been resolved privately.", "Mild YTA.

SMH", "YTA. A girl across the street isn't relevant to your stay in their house and shouldn't be a con to staying there.

You don't own the whole street just because you're renting a place on vacation. This girl was sitting on her own step, across the street from you, minding her own business and going about her day in a perfectly normal manner... so what on earth is the problem?? \n\nYour GF is right, it's extremely rude to talk about the neighbor who was literally just chilling there in your *public* review. And it's extra shitty to knock a star from a place due to a neighbor who had the gall to exist in your view. That can seriously hurt business for small hosts on AirBnB, and is just a weird and unfair thing to score them on.", "YTA. If you think it was a 5/5 stay, rate it that. The owner of the AirBnB can\u2019t do anything about the neighbors and how they act. Also, your girlfriend wasn\u2019t bothered at all with the girl, smoking at her own house and laughing, and just doing what she wants, which makes me think that maybe you were a little over paranoid?", "let me get this straight, you gave an Airbnb a 4/5 review because a neighbour was SITTING in front of her own house, quietly, and doing absolutely nothing to you? well, when you think you've heard everything....", "YTA. It's like giving less stars because it was raining 1 evening and while you were gone, your uncles cat died of old age in your home town.

No. YTA for the reduced rating.", "In general I'd say NTA, but in this case YTA specifically because you dinged them for something they cannot change and that something is all based on your assumptions of what the person across the road was doing.", "Info Is it gf or wife?\n\nAlso YTA. If you want solitude and silence then pay big bucks for a secluded mansion and you'll have no neighbors.", "YTA\n\nSo a girl who really wasn't doing anything but sitting on the steps of her house, talking on her phone, made you uncomfortable, so you gave the Airbnb you were staying at a bad review? You seriously make no logical sense at all. \n\nThe girl did nothing to you she would just stay in front of her house and you decided to use her as a reason to give negative review to the Airbnb?", "NTA. The atmosphere/ambiance of the neighborhood/location is extremely important to a lot of people when booking a rental.

What if the house is a flat above a noisy nightclub? What if it has a industrial plant making noise all night next door? What if it's next to a field regularly getting muck-spreading and the smell coming through (no joke, I knew someone who loved in such a place once). Those things spoil your holiday, the host can't change it, but that doesn't make it a nice stay. Similarly and conversely, a host might get five stars for being in a beautiful location, which also they didn't create and can't change, but that's also ok.\n\nThirdly: four stars is still good. If a host can't get a four star review and be ok with it then really the system is screwed up and that's not your fault. One star means terrible, two is fairly bad. But how four, or 75% good, can be unacceptable, I don't know. The rating is meant to help people pick somewhere good - if five stars just means \"ok\" then there's no way to really reward a super-perfect place and help them stand out.

If I was booking somewhere, I'd want to know that, and it would detract from the appeal of the house. In which case four stars seems fine, and (notwithstanding the question at the top about whether it should have been a joint review), no foul.\n\nIf there's a girl opposite doing what any other person would think is ok, and you're just taking offence at the way she sits, or the direction she looks, or her fashion sense, or being paranoid and making up issues that don't really exist, then yes, dropping a star for that is a bit of an AH move.\n\nI don't know which of those two scenarios best applies, so I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and use the top one, in which case there's no issue here.", "YTA", "So if someone dosent have a \"deck\" they shouldent be outside hanging out. \n\nYTA. \n\nThey are sitting there but thet dont even have a deck.

Well, if there is anything so wrong with the room that I need to call downstairs, you clearly don't deserve a 5 star rating.\n\nThe goal of all of these rating systems is not a true rating of the experience, but a grift to be able to advertise 'We're great!!!!!!

I took pictures when the big hill just outside town was on fire and I was figuring out how big it'd need to get before I'd evacuate (the crews ended up doing a really great job).
