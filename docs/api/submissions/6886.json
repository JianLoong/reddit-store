We went for a little trip to the next town over, and we got an Airbnb in the suburbs. It was just a small two bedroom house surrounded by other houses. It had a really nice big front deck that we would sit outside, eat dinner and drink on, and decent size kitchen and really modern renovated bathroom. The actual house was really nice. The problem was the neighbours, or more specifically the house across the road. When my girlfriend and I were out on the deck each night, a girl who lived in the house across the road was just sitting on her front door step. They didn\u2019t have a deck, she was just sitting on the step. Which is whatever, but she was smoking and laughing at her phone a lot, I also caught her looking up at us, I even had suspicions she was taking photos of us. It made me really uncomfortable but anytime I mentioned it to my girlfriend she shrugged it off and said to mind my business, so I did. A couple of days after we got home, my girlfriend was back at work so I decided to fill out a review for the AIRBNB we stayed at. I wrote all the pros about the house and there was a lot, but I did mention the girl across the road. I didn\u2019t go into much detail, I pretty much just said \u201cthere was a girl across from the house who would sit outside quiet frequently smoking which made me a bit uncomfortable, but besides that the place was perfect\u201d When my wife got home I mentioned to her that I filled out the review and I showed her, she got pretty upset. She said it was extremely rude to write about what someone else does in their own home, and said it\u2019s embarrassing for that \u2018poor girl\u2019, also said it wasn\u2019t fair to the AIRBNB owners because they only got 4 starts instead of the 5, when it was a 5 star stay. I can kind of see where she was coming from but I was just uncomfortable and wanted to express that in the review. I thought I would ask here to see what everyone thinks.\n\nEdit- wow i wasn\u2019t expecting so many people to disagree and I understand the rating system on AIRBNB now so I changed it to a five star. My wife is still pretty mad but she will get over it soon.

It's literally just another person, living her life that makes you uncomfortable? \n\nIf that's the case, and you have an issue with someone literally existing across the street, go to a hotel instead where you can complain about neighbors. You expressing your discomfort is alright, but in a review about a place that has nothing to do with the reason your upset is a little ridiculous.", "YTA\n\nSo a girl sits on her own doorstep chatting to her friend on the phone and every time she happens to glance up some creep in the house opposite is staring at her.  If I was sitting outside my own home and happened to notice someone staring at me I would keep looking over to see if they were still there!", "YTA. If the stay was truly five stars otherwise, I would not punish the owners (and the system is pretty brutal, they do suffer if they get four star ratings) just because their neighbour creeped you out - it's not in the owner's control.

But come on, if your girlfriend was not bothered by it and she was only minding her own business, then it is mostly about your own ego thinking everything around you is about you.. Why the heck do you think she was taking pictures of you?", "YTA. A 4-star review can do a lot of damage to an Airbnb host. It likely has already cost them some business. \n\nThere was a girl sitting across the street that made you uncomfortable. What does that have to do with the Airbnb host? Your review isn't meant to be a reflection of your entire stay/trip. It's a review of the host and their home.

You're basically punishing the owners for having their Airbnb in an actual neighbourhood with actual people living there. Unless there was a rule \"no smoking allowed by ANYONE in a 0.5 mile radius\" you have no reason to complain about it. It's also okay for people to sit in front of their houses, yes, really.", "YTA. If it was a 5/5 stay, rate it as such. It isn't anyone's fault that the neighbor from across was making you uncomfortable (and your girlfriend is right, this person is allowed to do what she wants on her own home, as long as it's legal). Something like that doesn't belong in a review. If anything this should have been resolved privately.", "Mild YTA. The neighbour was just sitting out the front of her house, just as you were doing, looking at you while you were clearly looking at her.

Since they\u2019re both in agreement I\u2019m going with them that your the AH", "Soft YTA\nThe stay was 5 stars, then rate it as such.

SMH", "YTA. A girl across the street isn't relevant to your stay in their house and shouldn't be a con to staying there. It doesn't sound like she was really doing anything problematic really.\n\nOn the other hand 4/5 stars is still a good rating. Not everything needs to be 5/5 or 1/5 stars.", "YTA!\n\nI don't know you, and I'm sure you're much nicer in person, but from this small snapshot you sound insufferable. You don't own the whole street just because you're renting a place on vacation. This girl was sitting on her own step, across the street from you, minding her own business and going about her day in a perfectly normal manner... so what on earth is the problem?? \n\nYour GF is right, it's extremely rude to talk about the neighbor who was literally just chilling there in your *public* review. And it's extra shitty to knock a star from a place due to a neighbor who had the gall to exist in your view. That can seriously hurt business for small hosts on AirBnB, and is just a weird and unfair thing to score them on.", "YTA. If you think it was a 5/5 stay, rate it that. The owner of the AirBnB can\u2019t do anything about the neighbors and how they act. Also, your girlfriend wasn\u2019t bothered at all with the girl, smoking at her own house and laughing, and just doing what she wants, which makes me think that maybe you were a little over paranoid?", "let me get this straight, you gave an Airbnb a 4/5 review because a neighbour was SITTING in front of her own house, quietly, and doing absolutely nothing to you? well, when you think you've heard everything....", "YTA. It's like giving less stars because it was raining 1 evening and while you were gone, your uncles cat died of old age in your home town. It may have led to a less fantastic travel experience, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the thing you are reviewing.", "YTA\n\nget therapy, the girl was doing the same thing as you and your wife - sitting outside", "Fuck airbnb and its bullshit influences on gentrification and the housing market, both for sales and rentals.\n\nYTA still though.", "That's something that should have been a comment only, not a rating. Is it important that people *know* about this in case it could cause trouble with their own stay? Sure. Do you need to punish the owners of the AirBnB who can't control that girl? No. YTA for the reduced rating.", "In general I'd say NTA, but in this case YTA specifically because you dinged them for something they cannot change and that something is all based on your assumptions of what the person across the road was doing.", "Info Is it gf or wife?\n\nAlso YTA. If you want solitude and silence then pay big bucks for a secluded mansion and you'll have no neighbors.", "YTA\n\nSo a girl who really wasn't doing anything but sitting on the steps of her house, talking on her phone, made you uncomfortable, so you gave the Airbnb you were staying at a bad review? You seriously make no logical sense at all. \n\nThe girl did nothing to you she would just stay in front of her house and you decided to use her as a reason to give negative review to the Airbnb?", "NTA. The atmosphere/ambiance of the neighborhood/location is extremely important to a lot of people when booking a rental. My husband is a very private person and would want to know if this happened to someone, and especially if the neighbor was mentioned other times too. You did not use any identifying information (address, name, age) or anything that could be considered offensive (height/weight, race, specific body features).", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA.

It\u2019s unfair to the owners that you blamed them for someone else\u2019s behaviour.\n\nNo HPO is perfect but people try so hard to please their guests. Sometimes I will rate 5* but send a DM to the owner. That way the owner is empowered to do something about an issue that they were previously unaware.", "Everything about our stay was great, but i saw someone across the street and that was not good. 4/5.\n\nYTA", "YTA. How did someone sitting outside their own house across the street having a smoke have any affect on your stay at all? What would you expect the Airbnb owner to do about it, even if it did have a material effect on your stay, which it did not? You punished the Airbnb owner for something that was both irrelevant and out of their control. People have neighbours. If you don't want that, stay in hotels.", "YTA. So if it has rained the entire time would you have also held that against the owners as well. It wasn\u2019t something to do with the house you are rating the property to others know not your holiday", "What did you expect from getting an AirBNB? That you\u2019d be the only person on the street?\n\nYTA", "YTA\nThis is someone\u2019s livelihood and they obviously provided a great 5 star property. If it was that much of a concern you could have mentioned to the host in a private message about the neighbor perhaps, but even then your girlfriend is right - that woman was on her property doing nothing more than having a smoke and looking at funny videos. Must be annoying for her to have strangers in an Airbnb staring at her going about her life.", " TBH, the right thing to do was to give it 5 stars and describe how nice it was. The fact that you were uncomfortable with the girl across the street *staring at you* has nothing to do with the quality of the Airbnb. \n\n   If the neighbor played loud music or had lights on that kept you from sleeping? That's something you tell the Airbnb owner/manager during or after your stay. \n\n TBH, if I were the owner & you told me this story\\~I'd think you were a bit odd.", "YTA, this is like saying.. I ate at a restaurant and it was wonderful, the food, the service, everything it was all 100% perfect. Oh but then when I left I noticed a kid on a skateboard across the street. He wasn\u2019t doing much just skating, but needless to say I was bothered by it. You see skateboarding gives me the creeps. So sorry perfect restaurant you only get 4 stars because you down own the whole block and can\u2019t keep skateboards off the neighbors properly\u2026 this mentality is very entitled. But I suppose you can\u2019t please everyone.. did you atleast ask to speak to a manager?", "YTA. I have an airbnb, 4 stars reviews really hurt it and it seems like you had a great stay. \n\nYou, a man and a visitor in the neighborhood, were made uncomfortable by a girl sitting outside her own house to smoke (I guess she should have known to quit or smoke inside her house during her stay??) looking BACK at you, who is, again,\na man she doesn\u2019t recognize in her neighborhood. \n\nAnd this is somehow the Airbnb\u2019s fault. Weirdo main character behavior on your part, get a grip", "YTA,", "Probably YTA. The only thing I don\u2019t think is an issue is to mention the smoking on the review. It was outside, so it should be fine, but including that information on the review isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s totally fine for that individual to do whatever they want on their own property/yard, but just mentioning the smoking (without the star reduction) would\u2019ve been fine to me as a warning for people that potentially have serious forms of health conditions where even just inhaling a little smoke even from across the street could be harmful to them. YTA for the star review though, I think, unless you or your wife have a serious health problem when around smoking like I mentioned", "Reminds me of my ex's mom, who'd stand on her front porch and say, \"Look at those busybodies down the street, standing on their porch talking about everyone.\"\n\nSeriously. \"The person I'm looking at looked at me\" is a pretty weak complaint. OP, YTA.", "**OP wanted a hotel and got pissed because Airbnb is not a hotel**\n\nI love it", "It was indeed bizarre that he was bothered by it, and bothered enough to dock 1 star out of the review. The only thing I disagree with your comment is the review addressing something the owner can or cannot do about it. Say for instance that the street was too noisy and busy, or neighbours complained of their presence... Those would be good things to warn others and yet there is little the owner can do about it.", "For any business with online ratings, giving anything less than 5 stars is asshole behaviour, to be honest. If they were bad and your intention is to give a bad review, go ahead, but if they were really good and you just had small niggles, it's usually better not to leave a review at all than to leave anything less than a perfect one. My business' industry has a site for local recommendations, which rates on 5 categories out of 5 stars- if we get a 4.8, it can knock us off first place and results in a huge scramble to get in a couple of 5 star reviews so we get back to the top of the list again, which is very important for us. What should be a super positive review is an absolute curse.\n\nIt's fine to write a review saying that you have one complaint, but put it on a 5 star score if you really want to leave one. It sucks, because you SHOULD be able to leave honest reviews with a fair assessment, especially if it's something like 4 stars, but you can't do that, so please, from people who rely on good reviews everywhere, don't ever leave anything less than a perfect review score online, unless your plan is to hurt the business.", "Why the hell does any site bother with a star review system if anything other than 5-star is taken as a zero? There is no nuance allowed anymore.\n\nThey should just switch to good or bad, or thumbs up or down, and be done with it.", "The irony is HE was spending so much of his time on the front porch, too. What\u2019s with the double standard??", "Yes I believe that it may come as a shock to OP but, other people actually do exist outside of his bubble.", "[removed]", "I like privacy, but i am also on a budget. I look at reviews for exactly the kind of information OP included. If there are noisy neighbors then i would probably prefer a different location.", "For AirBnB, anything less than 5 stars is a bad rating and it a host gets too many 4 star ratings, their property can be delisted by the site.", "Unfortunately, this just isn\u2019t how it works for most services nowadays. Not just on airbnb but also on Uber, Instacart etc, if you leave someone anything less than a perfect 5 stars you are really really screwing them over. It doesn\u2019t make logical sense but that\u2019s how it is.", "Why does it matter that the owner can't do anything about it? The owner also can't change stop trains or planes from moving, i would like to know if there is a lot of noise from something like this or from noisy neighbors when I consider renting a place. I can see that the review is not helpful for the owner, but as a potential guest OP's review is helpful too me.", "Well yes that could be a good thing to warn others about.. But someone living their life on their property shouldn't be it. If you don't want to encounter that, you don't go to an airbnb where people live around you... Especially since OP was also looking at the lady across... Someone else put it nicely by saying ops getting mad that the person he's looking at, was looking at him..", "Because you were looking at her. I'd be pointing at you too and honestly pointing at you to who? She was on her phone. No one else was out there. You may need to seek help.", "Was she maybe taking a selfie? The phone ends up pointing in much the same way.", "That's correct and many people fail to understand that. I ran an online food (desserts) business and we would automatically send emails asking for product reviews after delivery. One of our recurring customers would order at least twice a month and he'd send us messages suggesting new products, asking for discount codes and praising some of his favourite products. Yet he only ever reviewed 2 products he DIDN'T LIKE, one leaving a 3 star and the other a 1 star review. I was okay, albeit sad, receiving negative reviews, everyone's taste is different, but this guy ordered thousands of dollars worth of products and couldn't bother leaving one positive review?", "Most review systems for services are rotten like that", "I actually read reviews to see what the problem was.

That girl definitely has better things to think about than the couple staying at the Airbnb in front of her house. \nYTA, stop being paranoid and judgemental.", "What exactly was \"trash\" about her? She was using her own property outside of her own house just like you were using the deck of the airbnb.", "nah, you are most definitely the only trash here.", "So, your real problem was that you had to share public space with someone poor?", "Sure i get it but owner of the place isn't at fault and shouldn't receive less stars because of the neighborhood. I mean he can't do anything about that.", "Oh the horror!", "There are lots of things that would negatively effect an Airbnb that the owner can't do anything about, doesn't mean these things don't reflect the value of the Airbnb.", "That's sucks. Kinda unfair but i totally get it.", "I'm in between the mildest Y T A and N A H here, kind of undecided really.  You felt a little uncomfortable with your surroundings - that means your stay was less than perfect.  However, you sound overly sensitive about a person lounging on their front porch.\n\nAirBNB ratings are artificially inflated, just like Uber ratings.  When you rate them anything less than perfect, you can really hurt their business.  It shouldn't be that way but it is.  In an ideal world you would feel fine dinging them a star just because you didn't like the surroundings.  People would be much slower at calling you an asshole if you lowered your rating of a nice hotel because the other hotel guests bothered you.", "So op is mad because the person they were looking at looked at them? Honestly, nothing else to say but YTA.", "Why do you have an issue with someone smoking outside their house that's across the street from you? Surely the smoke doesn't bother you from that distance? It's just bizarre that you expect to not see your neighbours at all. YTA", "YTA. TF does she have to do with your stay? She didn't bother you.

She might have thought you guys weren't supposed to be there and was making sure her neighbour's house was fine.

If you want more privacy maybe look into renting a cabin next time.", "The reason why the wife is so mad he left that review was because he went with his girlfriend!  YTA", "Do you have a wife or girlfriend?", "Is your wife cool with you going on a road trip with your girlfriend?\n\nEdit: YTA because of how ratings work", "YTA. I'm glad you changed your review, but I think you need to see a therapist; paranoia that strangers minding their own business are secretly out to get you is a pretty clear symptom of a mental health problem.", "YTA dude wtf \nyou are literally staying at an airbnb surrounded by other peoples homes, and you\u2019re mad that they were happy and laughing god forbid IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN HOME? \nnot to mention to think that someone is taking pictures of you because they\u2019re happy and they\u2019re laughing?", "YTA why should something outside the AIRBNBs control affect your review for?", "YTA - the poor girl was living her own life on your on property.

You can rate however you want.", "YTA", "Against the grain here but NTA.
