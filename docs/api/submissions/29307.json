A pretty big fight happened right before our wedding, and after the wedding. We told them we need our space and they need to find somewhere to live. Long story short they bought a trailer and were gonna leave, we had a discussion and decided they could stay on our property (originally 3 months). Well 3 months came and went, then they said 6 months then 9 months. They were supposed to leave in September. When they couldn\u2019t leave in September we tried telling them we really need our space back. It started a huge fight, they said they only need another month and gave us a date they would be off the property. That came come and went, they never asked for another extension of time. I confronted them, they said they need another 2 weeks. During this time, they have not moved any of their things off the property. I told them I could not do another 2 weeks, that we needed to speed this up. This came to blows. My parents told me I owe them. When I told them I was not changing my mind, they told me to never talk to them again, to never see them again. Basically, I am dead to them now. They then tell me they are moving this Monday. \n\nAm I in the wrong for asking them to leave? For standing my ground? I love my parents. But me and my wife just want our privacy and have plans for our property that have been on hold since they have been here.", "created_utc": 1697814382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cdg9a/aita_told_my_parents_they_have_to_move_out/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents don't care about you. They have had ample opportunity to, for example, talk about an extension _before the date comes and goes_. They repeatedly chose not to. They chose to trample on your boundaries. They chose to take advantage of you. They chose to make you the bad guy.\n\nSometimes the trash takes itself out. This is one of those times.", "NTA - What do you owe them for exactly?\n\nIs this that they chose to have children and had to then look after the children that they chose to have? I hate that attitude.\n\nI\u2019d say allowing them to live with you for 18 months is a pretty big payment at any rate.", "NTA. They are trying to guilt you into giving them what they want. If they never talk to you again, I would be surprised, but honestly, is that a truly bad thing. Sound like they would suck the desert sand dry. \n\nTrust me, when you have children, they will reappear and create more havoc in you and your wife\u2019s lives", "NTA\n\nyou have been more than fair and flexible and they have continually taken the piss.", "NTA at all. But you might have to consult a lawyer to get them off your property.", "You owe them for what? Raising you? They chose to have you, you didn't ask them for that. I can't even say you owe them if they helped pay for the place you live now, that's usually a gift and you can't give a gift with strings attached. \n\nI'm curious why they sold the house though? Did they sell with intent to buy another or did they sell because they needed to pay off debt and are struggling now?", "Just let them go. They've been mooching of you for almost a year now and they're just throwing a fit because you put your foot down.\n\nETA NTA", "NTA you owe your parents nothing.", "INFO: what was the original fight about?", "NTA, it's been made clear and they have constantly failed to adhere to the deadline,personally I'd go NC with them if they ever go, they seem to think they are owed.", "NTA. They will reach out when they need something again. Probably before the next date they are supposed to move out. Cal the bluff", "NTA your parents have consistently shown you they do not keep their word. Threatening to never talk to you again will be something they go back on as well. I\u2019d bet as soon as they need something from you they will contact you again.", "NTA. Unless you specifically owe your parents for something they\u2019ve done since you became an adult, you don\u2019t owe them for raising you. That was their idea.", "NTA... If you're this cross with your own parents I can't even imagine what your wife is going through. I wish you both all the best.", "Nta. If they don't leave, you need to threaten them with legal eviction and thr police to remove them from the property. If they are accessing your water or power, shut it off in the main house and keep the doors locked. It is clear your parents are the problem here.", "You may need to actually evict them.", "Most definitely NTA. They\u2019re treating you like a doormat and completely disrespecting you and your spouse. They threaten the no contact to try and manipulate you. Let them have nothing to do with you in the future. Your life will be better without such horrible people in your life.", "Heck no.. and you know this already.. they were never going to leave until you stood up for them. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe them anything.. when did you ask to be born.. they made the decision to have a child and that comes taking care of said child. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.. it\u2019s time you focus on your marriage.. \n\nThey are just trying to guilt you into letting them stay.. don\u2019t keep letting them manipulate you", "Sounds like some dead beat entitled boomers to me. NTA", "NTA but your parents had/have absolutely no intention of leaving.\n\nYou need to prepare yourself for that. And quite frankly if they never talk to you again that's probably a bonus.\n\nI can't imagine how your wife feels about all this crazy attached to the house", "NTA- Your folks were taking advantage of you. You gave them a hand and they went up to your elbow.", "Never see them again? Great, where do I sign? NTA", "what do you love about them?\n\nthey're leeches and they don't care how their behaviour is impacting you or your family.\n\nNTA.\n\ngo no contact.", "NTA. But, I am confused about some of the details. \"Came to blows,\" literally means a fist fight? Hopefully there were no blows, right? Sorry. I'm trying to understand what really happened?\n\nBut, I think its fine that you asked them to take their trailer out of your back yard and just move already. What I can't picture is why if they live in the trailer, this has become so inconvenient for you? Do they take meals and baths and watch TV inside your house? (None of that matters and I know that. I was just curious why you need your space back if they live in the trailer?)", "Kinda TA but Kinda NTA depending on what the first fight during the fight was about. If it was something you can't forgive but never forget or something completely unforgivable? That's something to keep in consideration. \n\nFor people saying \"we never chose to be brought in this world\" you're right but we were. Those parents didn't have to keep you, or feed you, or cloth you, or buy you things, or do anything for you, etc cause I know some parents don't they are terrible but some parents are decent and loving no parent is perfect and make mistakes but they do with what they have. Thats also something to take into consideration. \n\nYes, you need your privacy, but have you considered maybe they really don't have a choice and they aren't telling you cause they're scared? \n\nBut yeah they are kind of TA for not leaving when they said they would, for never giving you a break. But sometimes everyone has a reason and parents don't like to admit to defeats.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Oh NTA at all", "They made a lot of money on their house, close to a million dollars. And chose to build a house that they apparently would not have been able to afford if they didn\u2019t live with us.", "They sold because they had housing in mind.

Why did your parents say they had been?", "Whoa Nelly.", "Just to add to this. I do not believe my parents owe me anything. I am grateful for them raising me and giving me overall a good life.

And decided to bring this all up the night before our wedding. Not in a nice way either.", "But imo the original fight that caused this tension was said and done. Which is why we agreed to let them stay for 3 months on the property originally. We told them they don\u2019t need to be friends or even see my wife\u2019s parents. But they will show respect especially while living with us. Because her parents do not talk that way about them. It is uncalled for."]}
