A pretty big fight happened right before our wedding, and after the wedding. We told them we need our space and they need to find somewhere to live. Long story short they bought a trailer and were gonna leave, we had a discussion and decided they could stay on our property (originally 3 months). Well 3 months came and went, then they said 6 months then 9 months. They were supposed to leave in September. When they couldn\u2019t leave in September we tried telling them we really need our space back. It started a huge fight, they said they only need another month and gave us a date they would be off the property. That came come and went, they never asked for another extension of time. I confronted them, they said they need another 2 weeks. During this time, they have not moved any of their things off the property. I told them I could not do another 2 weeks, that we needed to speed this up. This came to blows. My parents told me I owe them. When I told them I was not changing my mind, they told me to never talk to them again, to never see them again. Basically, I am dead to them now. They then tell me they are moving this Monday. \n\nAm I in the wrong for asking them to leave? For standing my ground? I love my parents. But me and my wife just want our privacy and have plans for our property that have been on hold since they have been here. \n\nETA - I\u2019m not going to remove it but I did not mean a physical argument when I said come to blows. Just the whole conversation went from civil to not nice very quickly when I told them I could not do another two weeks and we need to at least start the process of getting them moved sooner, I was not going to kick them out that day.

File an eviction and get them the fuck out and never let em back again.", "NTA. It sounds like they were willing to continue sponging off you and your wife with no regard to how it affects you.", "NTA though you shouldn't have let them move in. They sold their house, why did they need to move in? What happened to all of the stuff in the house?", "NTA.  Children don't \"owe\" their parents! It was wrong of them to say that and they're definitely taking advantage of you at this point.\n\nThey do need to get their own place, as in right now!", "You and your fianc\u00e9 were very gracious to host them for 18 months. That being said, They have become entitled. I would have the attitude \u2018call me when you get over it\u2019 trust me, they will. BTW you\u2019re a nice kid.", "Why did they sell their house? Was the plan when they sold to stay with you guys?", "Can you call a towing company to tow it in 2 weeks?\n\nThen you could give them 2 weeks and still be sure theyll be gone in 2 weeks.", "They are squatters who hope that they can live there forever. They said as much with the \"you owe us\" comment. Why do you owe them? For raising you? Did their parents do the same to them? Why do you have to sacrifice your privacy, property, and plans because they are being selfish? They want to live for free off of you and expect you to cancel any plans you have for the property, which means they are basically stealing your land to live on. If they try to put you off again, tell them you'll have them removed if they don't leave. They don't even have tenants rights. NTA", "I'll not have you talking bad about trash.\n\nBTW my name's Trash", "So they\u2019ve been with us for a year and a half. They arnt \u201cannoying\u201d and that wouldn\u2019t be a reason I would necessarily want them gone. During this time we got married and before our wedding they made my wife cry and said hurtful things about her family that were unwarranted or could\u2019ve at least waited instead of at our wedding. My wife has been trying her best but the fact is we have been living with them every since this happened and it\u2019s like the wound is \u201cstill fresh\u201d as my wife describes it. She feels isolated because her family cannot visit her because my parents hate them. they do not pay rent. They use our garage that is severely damaged and needs repairs as storage. Garage can\u2019t be repaired or worked on because there would be no where to put their stuff, and their travel trailer is directly against the damaged part of the garage. My parents did not have to sell their home, they sold their home because they were able to make almost a million dollars due to its increase in value.", "Not at the start of the arrangement. Sold their home for almost a million dollars. Not so sure the state of their financials now - as they say they spent all their money building this home.", "You are one of today's [lucky 10.000!](https://xkcd.com/1053)", "Right. Why leave if he keeps giving them more time. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t ask for more time after this last one. Why waste time asking when he\u2019s just going to cave and agree.", "Are you sure they're actually building a new property?", "You need to kick them out. NTA\n\nSorry your wife went through that. My MIL told me, once the house sale is complete she can increase rent payment. We never asked. She offered because she is reasonable. \n\nYour parents see you as a slave - someone they have power over and expects you to obey their every wish. That\u2019s why they are not offering rent even though they have so much money. \n\nWith their lack of logic and selfishness, they going lose all that money and come back begging you. At that time, you will have the upper hand and you can set the rules.", "They should have been kicked out for the complete disrespect to your wife. \n\nSounds like they made a killing on their home sale and are living with you cheaply. They aren\u2019t destitute and have options. \n\nYou\u2019ve let this drag on for far too long and have prioritized them over your wife over, and over, and over again. I\u2019m not sure whether to call your wife a saint or an idiot for putting up with you and your parents for so long.", "Why do you think they\u2019re being such A-holes about leaving? And you said the argument came to blows. You mean you were literally hitting each other? How did they go from being parents you love and care for to this?!", "That's really what it is about, IMHO. Being a good person and helping others. You've done more than anyone could expect and it is time for them to find their own path. \n\nI am so sorry you are dealing with all of this. Hope it goes well for you.", "My personal belief that we all owe our families, friends, co-workers, community - and basically the world to be *decent people*.", "Wait what? A baby can choose not to be born in your opinion? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "> the gays???\n\nLooks like you've found something to be offended by! How exciting!!", "No many keep asking about the come to blows. I mean like the conversation like just exploded. Didn\u2019t go well. Hence why they told me I\u2019m dead to them", "Thank you for clarifying. \"Came to a head\" might be a better phrase in this instance. Regardless, the seriousness of the situation came across.
