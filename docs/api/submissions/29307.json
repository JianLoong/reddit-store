I've done a deep dive into this with several people she has done this too, and it's pretty clear... she's just crazy (doctors have had to dig around in her brain... twice).

No...  not anymore.  I thought I did for a long time, but they simply ended up not deserving my love or respect.  \n\nGood luck, I'm sorry this happened.
