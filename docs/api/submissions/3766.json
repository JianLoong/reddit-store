She may have been fine with skating up until the moment she was ready to step on the ice. And then she wasn't. Grief is funny like that. You're fine, and then it crashes over you like a tidal wave, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nEven worse is you **utter** lack of concern when she did start to break down. No empathy, no care, no comfort. You were the ones making a scene. You were the ones scolding her and berating her. $55 dollars *is* money, but it's *nothing* compared to the well being of your **daughter**. You all had to make the big stink and push and push. Thank God ONE of your children had enough heart to sit with her, talk to her, listen to her, and care for her.", "YTA. Sure, she is grieving her husband, but she should put that aside because someone spent money on tickets.

The only person whose behaviour was embarrassing here was yours.  Honestly, you should be ashamed of yourself. People look to their mothers for comfort in their times of emotional distress, but you sound quite awful, honestly.

How is that ok?", "YTA, as it\u2019s only been a year, & that was the first time she even agreed to try it, SIL shouldn\u2019t have bought her a non refundable ticket. Stop bullying your grieving child and try being a compassionate parent. And any family member who can\u2019t understand that can pound sand. Or tell them to think how they\u2019d feel being bullied into doing something without their spouse so soon after they died.", "YTA. You're so selfish. You should be supporting and caring for your daughter. Instead you're being mean and awful to her. You are devoid of empathy. So is your husband and your family are all assholes too, except for D. Someday you'll suffer a big loss. Don't expect your daughter to comfort you. You're too selfish to deserve it.", "YTA: Grief can seriously mess with a person in unexpected ways. Your daughter didn't make the scene, everyone pushing her to skate when she realized she couldn't were the ones making the scene. She tried, she honestly thought she could participate and she tried to do so, but when she was face to face with it, all she could see was her dead husband.", "YTA! It\u2019s a fucking ticket for ice skating\u2026. What was that\u2026.$10?! Vs awful, souls destroying grief triggered by an activity that was shared by a loving couple that she\u2019ll never ever have again. Dafuq is wrong with you?", "YTA big time and also SIL. If she really was pissed because of the money, could you just not refund her privately, for the sake of your own daughter?", "YTA. In fact you are all assholes except your daughters. Why couldn't the family do a different activity? So insensitive!", "YTA\n\nWith a mother like you I'm happy M has a sister like D who has her back. \nYour daughter is grieving she lost someone she planned on spending the rest of her life with. A year is absolutely nothing and she probably at the time thought that she could handle skating. \nYou and your family are truly awful and you better hope M doesn't decide to go LC because frankly you would deserve it.", "WOW!! YTAs...all of you.. except D who seemed to be the only understanding one out of the entire family. Way to show some empathy and compassion.", "YTA.\nShe lost her husband an year ago. And skating was their main hobby together how could any of you think that would be appropriate?! Or could not predict that she may not feel to do it yet?.\n\nYour SIL offered to buy the ticket, that is her problem. She did a present and then is on other to accept it or not. She should have think twice before buying something with not refund in a situation like that.", "I read your title.\n\nAnd then I got to this-\n\n\u2018He passed last year and M's pretty much refused to step foot in a rink since then\u2019\n\nThere are no words you could put after this that are relevant or would not make you an AH.\n\nYTA\n\nAlso since you seem to have no empathy, let me explain how the holidays can be especially hard for those who are grieving.

If the wasted money was so much of a concern, why not let her have her moment and reimburse the SIL afterwards. You are all actually blaming her for being unable to process the death of her husband quick enough to let you all enjoy an activity. It\u2019s not like she did ask you all to leave the place, she just didn\u2019t want to skate herself and needed emotional support. Thankfully, her sister understood.\n\nDistresses like that will happen now and in the future, she might never want to skate again, you have to respect her choices and let space for her feelings. Nothing is more important than supporting her in this type of moments. SIL being pissed being really bottom of list if anything.", "YTA. Enjoy your poop knife.", "YTA. The only person she was embarrassing was you and you couldn\u2019t stand it.", "YTA", "Jesus why would all of you care so much? How much do skating tickets cost? I'm assuming ice skating which I'll assume cost more than roller skating/rollerblading. And let's say you rented shoes. Is it $80? $100? I'm sure M could pay it back, even if it needed to be done in installments.\nEven without the obvious grief why the hell would your family care that she didn't skate?", "YTA everyone here has said all that needs to be said.", "YTA I seriously doubt the tickets cost that much that you would be so callous to your daughter for not wanting to skate. You could have been a supportive mom and offered to reimburse your SIL the price of the ticket if she got upset. Your daughter didn\u2019t ask your SIL to purchase a ticket for her and she was under no obligation to go skating. If I surprise you with sky diving tickets, are you TA for refusing to go?", "YTA. And everyone in your family sucks. Your daughter is grieving. She hoped she would be able to go the rink but in the end she could't. It is understandable. The family should comfort and support her not make her feel worse.", "Wow\u2026. YTA.   Pay SIL back for two tickets and go get a coffee with  your daughter while everyone else is skating.   When you decide that it\u2019s more important how it looks to other people than emotionally supporting your kid when in crisis you have failed as a parent/person.     Shame on you!", "YTA\n\nYou seem to think the loss of a few dollars is more important than the loss of her husband.", "She tried to opt out in the first place and you all wouldn\u2019t let her. \n\nYou and your husband and your SIL and the rest of the family need to buy some empathy instead of skating tickets. \n\nYTA.

Thank the maker for a good sister for M because she clearly doesn\u2019t have anyone else in her corner.", "YTA so when people are having strong emotions, you just tell them to stop making a scene? People who are as clueless as you are the ones who make the scene. If you all had respected the fact that she said NO, and let her sit with D, she wouldn't have started crying. Shame on you all.", "YTA and horribly insensitive. And for the love of God, use fake names. These letters are too hard to follow.", "YTA. You're a real Mommy Dearest.  She associates the skating with her deceased husband - is it really so hard to understand?  She was willing to try and then realized it was just too hard.  Okay.  No big damn deal.  How much could those tickets have possibly cost that it was worth being so mean to your daughter?", "YTA\n\nIt was what, a $10 free skate ticket? You think SIL\u2019s $10 is more important than the feelings of your grieving daughter?", "Big YTA\n\nSkating tickets are cheap. \nYour daughter lost her HUSBAND one year ago.

You were both beyond cruel.\n\nHere's what happened. M has been avoiding the rink, a specific place where she has lots of good memories with her late husband. Being there again triggered her grief and she broke down. Instead of embracing her grief and letting her work through her exposure to something triggering, you shamed her and made her feel bad about it.\n\nA year after my mom passed away I flew back to the country where she was living. She usually greeted me at the airport with this huge smile and would bounce around excitedly as I walked towards her. On my first time back since her passing, I looked up and in my mind's eye I saw her even though I knew she wasn't there. It was like I was split in two. The experience was disorienting and overwhelming and I crumbled. I was absolutely bawling like a child. My dad was there to pick me up and immediately scooped me up and comforted me while it passed. He didn't care that his 38 year old was crying in the middle of the airport, he cared only about trying to make the experience hurt less. Do you know why? Because he's not an asshole. He has a basic understanding of human emotions.\n\nWe expect to lose our parents some day, and I imagine losing a partner so young is significantly worse. Just... YTA.

There are triggers to grief and there is no time period to grief. Your daughter thought she could do it; she couldn't, and you exacerbated the problem by diminishing her grief. Shame on you. Thankfully, D was there. You were the one embarrassed. You wanted her to cooperate and not make a scene for your benefit and the benefit of the group. You wanted a pleasant day and she ruined it for you. (Almost 22 months after the death of my husband I still find  myself curled in a ball on the floor sobbing.)", "Wtf is wrong with you? She thought she could do it but had an understandable moment of grief and realized she wasn\u2019t ready. You and your SIL should be totally ashamed for how you treated her.

This year I was having a harder time again so I had no desire to even try watching it. \n\nThere are certain things we did together that I can do again & it hurts not doing them with her but I get through it, but the movies are the one thing that I\u2019m just not ready to do yet bc it was a very special thing only her & I did together up until I moved out.\n\nI cannot believe the callousness this entire family showed to her daughter. Especially when it was something that they all knew was so special between her & her husband.

What\u2019s not okay is the fact she wasted someone else\u2019s money. Tickets are not cheap and for someone to pay for her and then back out was disrespectful. One of two things should have been done on her part: Apologize to her aunt about not being able to use the ticket and reimburse her or Explain that she will pay her own way just in case she can\u2019t bring herself to skate. Either of those solutions would have been fine. If the situation was reversed and Aunt had offered to pay for everyone but your daughter she would have seem like TAH, even though she knew your daughter had not skated since his passing.

You have TWO husbands, although one is an EX, THEY ARE BOTH ALIVE. I have no Grace for you and little agape either in this case. \n\nYou are disparaging of her marriage, yeah I read your comments, you also think her youth negates the depth of her pain. I feel for this young woman surrounded by the privileged who still have their spouse, thus have absolutely no empathy , or sympathy, let alone understanding of any kind. \n\nYEESH! With y\u2019all around who needs enemies, frenemies, or malicious strangers. \n\nOP, I hope you never have to experience the loss. It is a pit from hell that you hope doesn\u2019t swallow you whole. Some days you just put your back up against the wall and try to survive. \n\nMy husband was my Home. For the past year, I have been homeless. A week before Christmas will mark one full year.

Lucky them, but they are insensitive AF.", "YTA, OP and I don't understand this \"wasted ticket\" business. The money is gone, whether she skates or not. So the choice is essentially between forcing her to do something that would make her miserable or leaving her be.

A friend helped me, and when I started crying she held me close. Now that they're up I'm enjoying the memories, so I'm glad I did it..But things like this take their own time. I hope you can find some love and cheer this holiday season.

My kid is little but it\u2019s easy to tell with her what\u2019s her acting out and what\u2019s genuine grief/fear/sadness. \n\nMy mom widowed early too. The thing that upset my daughter this year was COVID almost took me out. I woke up three weeks later. I asked my mom last month why people didn\u2019t care and wouldn\u2019t talk to me about it (because NO ONE would, it\u2019s so weird) and she said it was the same when dad died. Aside from me and grandma (who was also a young widow), no one asked her either.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. I can see why people talking to me about facing my mortality in our 30s is scary and weird, especially since those three weeks were probably just a long hallucination or dream for me. But my mom was still here. She was still alive and well and easy to see as someone who\u2019d been hurt through no fault of her own. (I also lost a lot of friends when he died. Idk why.)\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget that. That even in the most unambiguous of circumstances, that people\u2019s support dried up for her.

YTA.", "I think her sister D is supportive.", "Yeah and the thing is she thought she could and wanted to try because she likely felt she'd have support of her loved ones.

OP is a jerk.", "OP could have helped her daughter process some of her grief by understanding how hard this must have been for her, validating her feelings and comforting her. With the way she handled it, her daughter will not want to skate an even longer time or ever.", "32 years for me, and 4 since my husband passed..There is no timetable for grief. And M is a much younger widow than I am--I cannot imagine losing my husband at a very young age.", "I had a similar meltdown in the grocery store several months after my husband passed. It was weird--it came over me like a wave. It felt wrong to be there. I couldn't find anything. I started walking out and ran into a friend, who sat me down in the cafe with coffee and gave my shopping list to her teenage daughter. By the time she finished, I was OK, and they helped me chack out and walked me to my car.", "I had a breakdown in a target when I got the news about what had gotten my dad. I actually flopped on the floor and picked off all my nail stuff from my wedding (a week prior; they probably knew well before that but didn\u2019t want to ruin the wedding) and threw it on the floor and just sobbed. The manager helped me out and got me an Uber. I appreciate him. Most people around me (physically, at the Target) said I was a disrespectful brat. Telling them I got the news of my father\u2019s cause of death via text didn\u2019t impact how they acted either. Someone brought it up in the city\u2019s Facebook group ffs. It was so callous.", "My dad passed away 11 years ago. It took me 5 or 6 years to stop feeling like a shell of a person, like a critical part inside me broke. By now, I've made peace with it; it's a part of my life story. BUT even with being \"okay,\" my mouth still went dry when I told my coworker about this recently. I wanted to say it factually, but it came out all wrong... too much breathiness in my words, a slight stinging in my eyes. I can't even explain where it came from.\n\nMy mom sold our family home a few years ago. It made a lot of sense and I supported her. But goddamnit I cried. I sobbed. It was saying goodbye to the home full of memories of him. I'm tearing up just thinking about it. I think grief just rearranges who you are and it's something you always live with.", "Thank you and bless you, and may you find some cheer in this season.", "This I don't get. You can grieve, but it's not ok to let your grief hurt the people around you.", "I'm a widow. I can see how she thought she'd like to go, and then get there and freeze because it's happened to me. The first time I did a lot of things I'd always done with my husband I either backed out or broke down when confronted by it.", "It could also be as simple as M thought she could handle it only to realize at the rink it was too much for her. When grief is at play, many things become uncertain", "I'm sure if OP's SIL and the other family members had given her space and support to grieve, she might have actually offered to reimburse the ticket cost if it was that big a deal. But personally, if I offered to pay for a widow to try one of the hobbies she and her late husband had shared for the first time since his death, I'd be mortified if she thought she had to pay me back because she had been too overcome with grief to participate.", "Your friend and he daughter sound like lovely people. So glad you have people like them in your life.", "Exactly.\n\nI was very close with my late Grandad. He always smelt *clean* and of a specific \u2018imperial leather\u2019 bar of soap that he used every day.

The smell of the specific bar of soap hit me out of nowhere and I just started sobbing.

It's been 4 years.", "Thank you!", "Yeah that\u2019s completely understandable. I have no problem with M deciding she didn\u2019t want to do it once she got there.

She probably saved you a lifetime of misery by cheating on you.

I hope you have good and happy memories to comfort you.", "I'm sorry you have such an awful support system , besides your mom and daughter.", "Totally agree. I'm assuming this is Rockefeller Center. Highest peak time ticket is $65 and they go as low as $21.

You sound like my mum. Guess who I don't talk to much anymore.", "YTA. A giant one. And so is SIL. Your daughter lost her husband. She tried to force herself to try something she used to enjoy with him. It was too hard for her. You put a minor embarrassment over money ahead of your own child\u2019s trauma.
