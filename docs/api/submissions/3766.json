She may have been fine with skating up until the moment she was ready to step on the ice. And then she wasn't. Grief is funny like that. You're fine, and then it crashes over you like a tidal wave, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nEven worse is you **utter** lack of concern when she did start to break down. No empathy, no care, no comfort. You were the ones making a scene. You were the ones scolding her and berating her. $55 dollars *is* money, but it's *nothing* compared to the well being of your **daughter**. You all had to make the big stink and push and push. Thank God ONE of your children had enough heart to sit with her, talk to her, listen to her, and care for her.", "YTA. Sure, she is grieving her husband, but she should put that aside because someone spent money on tickets.

The only person whose behaviour was embarrassing here was yours.  Honestly, you should be ashamed of yourself. People look to their mothers for comfort in their times of emotional distress, but you sound quite awful, honestly.

You\u2019re worried more that your grieving daughter is making you look bad and that a ticket is going to waste than seeing about her. What kinda mental gymnastics are you doing to justify that to yourself? How is that ok?", "YTA, as it\u2019s only been a year, & that was the first time she even agreed to try it, SIL shouldn\u2019t have bought her a non refundable ticket. Stop bullying your grieving child and try being a compassionate parent. And any family member who can\u2019t understand that can pound sand. Or tell them to think how they\u2019d feel being bullied into doing something without their spouse so soon after they died.", "YTA. You're so selfish. You should be supporting and caring for your daughter. Instead you're being mean and awful to her. You are devoid of empathy. So is your husband and your family are all assholes too, except for D. Someday you'll suffer a big loss. Don't expect your daughter to comfort you. You're too selfish to deserve it.", "YTA: Grief can seriously mess with a person in unexpected ways. Your daughter didn't make the scene, everyone pushing her to skate when she realized she couldn't were the ones making the scene. She tried, she honestly thought she could participate and she tried to do so, but when she was face to face with it, all she could see was her dead husband.", "YTA! It\u2019s a fucking ticket for ice skating\u2026. What was that\u2026.$10?! Vs awful, souls destroying grief triggered by an activity that was shared by a loving couple that she\u2019ll never ever have again. Dafuq is wrong with you?", "YTA big time and also SIL. If she really was pissed because of the money, could you just not refund her privately, for the sake of your own daughter?", "YTA. In fact you are all assholes except your daughters. Why couldn't the family do a different activity? So insensitive!", "YTA\n\nWith a mother like you I'm happy M has a sister like D who has her back. \nYour daughter is grieving she lost someone she planned on spending the rest of her life with. A year is absolutely nothing and she probably at the time thought that she could handle skating. \nYou and your family are truly awful and you better hope M doesn't decide to go LC because frankly you would deserve it.", "WOW!! YTAs...all of you.. except D who seemed to be the only understanding one out of the entire family. Way to show some empathy and compassion.", "YTA.\nShe lost her husband an year ago. And skating was their main hobby together how could any of you think that would be appropriate?! Or could not predict that she may not feel to do it yet?.\n\nYour SIL offered to buy the ticket, that is her problem. She did a present and then is on other to accept it or not. She should have think twice before buying something with not refund in a situation like that.", "I read your title.\n\nAnd then I got to this-\n\n\u2018He passed last year and M's pretty much refused to step foot in a rink since then\u2019\n\nThere are no words you could put after this that are relevant or would not make you an AH.\n\nYTA\n\nAlso since you seem to have no empathy, let me explain how the holidays can be especially hard for those who are grieving.

If the wasted money was so much of a concern, why not let her have her moment and reimburse the SIL afterwards. You are all actually blaming her for being unable to process the death of her husband quick enough to let you all enjoy an activity. It\u2019s not like she did ask you all to leave the place, she just didn\u2019t want to skate herself and needed emotional support. Thankfully, her sister understood.\n\nDistresses like that will happen now and in the future, she might never want to skate again, you have to respect her choices and let space for her feelings. Nothing is more important than supporting her in this type of moments. SIL being pissed being really bottom of list if anything.", "YTA. Enjoy your poop knife.", "YTA. The only person she was embarrassing was you and you couldn\u2019t stand it.", "YTA", "Jesus why would all of you care so much? How much do skating tickets cost? I'm assuming ice skating which I'll assume cost more than roller skating/rollerblading. And let's say you rented shoes. Is it $80? $100? I'm sure M could pay it back, even if it needed to be done in installments.\nEven without the obvious grief why the hell would your family care that she didn't skate?", "YTA everyone here has said all that needs to be said.", "YTA I seriously doubt the tickets cost that much that you would be so callous to your daughter for not wanting to skate. You could have been a supportive mom and offered to reimburse your SIL the price of the ticket if she got upset. Your daughter didn\u2019t ask your SIL to purchase a ticket for her and she was under no obligation to go skating. If I surprise you with sky diving tickets, are you TA for refusing to go?", "YTA. And everyone in your family sucks. Your daughter is grieving. She hoped she would be able to go the rink but in the end she could't. It is understandable. The family should comfort and support her not make her feel worse.", "Wow\u2026. YTA.   Pay SIL back for two tickets and go get a coffee with  your daughter while everyone else is skating.   When you decide that it\u2019s more important how it looks to other people than emotionally supporting your kid when in crisis you have failed as a parent/person.     Shame on you!", "YTA\n\nYou seem to think the loss of a few dollars is more important than the loss of her husband.", "She tried to opt out in the first place and you all wouldn\u2019t let her. \n\nYou and your husband and your SIL and the rest of the family need to buy some empathy instead of skating tickets. \n\nYTA.

Thank the maker for a good sister for M because she clearly doesn\u2019t have anyone else in her corner.", "YTA so when people are having strong emotions, you just tell them to stop making a scene? People who are as clueless as you are the ones who make the scene. If you all had respected the fact that she said NO, and let her sit with D, she wouldn't have started crying. Shame on you all.", "YTA and horribly insensitive. And for the love of God, use fake names. These letters are too hard to follow.", "YTA. You're a real Mommy Dearest.  She associates the skating with her deceased husband - is it really so hard to understand?  She was willing to try and then realized it was just too hard.  Okay.  No big damn deal.  How much could those tickets have possibly cost that it was worth being so mean to your daughter?", "YTA\n\nIt was what, a $10 free skate ticket? You think SIL\u2019s $10 is more important than the feelings of your grieving daughter?", "Big YTA\n\nSkating tickets are cheap. \nYour daughter lost her HUSBAND one year ago.

You were both beyond cruel.\n\nHere's what happened. M has been avoiding the rink, a specific place where she has lots of good memories with her late husband. Being there again triggered her grief and she broke down. Instead of embracing her grief and letting her work through her exposure to something triggering, you shamed her and made her feel bad about it.\n\nA year after my mom passed away I flew back to the country where she was living. She usually greeted me at the airport with this huge smile and would bounce around excitedly as I walked towards her. On my first time back since her passing, I looked up and in my mind's eye I saw her even though I knew she wasn't there. It was like I was split in two. The experience was disorienting and overwhelming and I crumbled. I was absolutely bawling like a child. My dad was there to pick me up and immediately scooped me up and comforted me while it passed. He didn't care that his 38 year old was crying in the middle of the airport, he cared only about trying to make the experience hurt less. Do you know why? Because he's not an asshole. He has a basic understanding of human emotions.\n\nWe expect to lose our parents some day, and I imagine losing a partner so young is significantly worse. Just... YTA.

There are triggers to grief and there is no time period to grief. Your daughter thought she could do it; she couldn't, and you exacerbated the problem by diminishing her grief. Shame on you. Thankfully, D was there. You were the one embarrassed. You wanted her to cooperate and not make a scene for your benefit and the benefit of the group. You wanted a pleasant day and she ruined it for you. (Almost 22 months after the death of my husband I still find  myself curled in a ball on the floor sobbing.)", "Wtf is wrong with you? She thought she could do it but had an understandable moment of grief and realized she wasn\u2019t ready. You and your SIL should be totally ashamed for how you treated her.

How dare you.", "She did mean it like that though. That's why she said it.\n\nI don't know why you think ages are relevant here. She lost her husband. Being young doesn't affect that at all. Her world as she knew it ended, and you're all acting like nothing happened.\n\nWhat awful, unfeeling monsters you all are. I hope she never speaks to any of you again, because you don't deserve relationships with normal, non-awful humans.", "I was engaged when I was 25 and he was killed in a car accident a few months before the wedding.  I am almost 50 now and there\u2019s still things that I can\u2019t do or songs I can\u2019t listen to because they hurt me too much.  Grief is not linear and you don\u2019t get to tell someone to get over her grief and you certainly don\u2019t get to berate her for bowing out of ice skating because her grief is too raw. Your daughter is grieving!  take away everything else the money for the tickets, the other family members.  why is your first instinct not to comfort your grieving daughter?  Why is anger and berating her your go to?  How is any of that bullshit(skating, family activities) more important than your grieving daughter?", "Your husband's family sound like sh**ty people. I feel for your daughter. YTA!", "No wonder she isn't talking to you, your SILs loss of $55 is more important than your daughters loss of her husband it seems.", "It doesn\u2019t matter how she meant it. It was fucking cruel. I can\u2019t imagine finding the love of my life at a young age and getting married and being so excited for our future and then losing it all in the blink of an eye. Even if she does move on and find someone else again, every milestone she hits she is going to be thinking what it might have been like if she had hit that milestone with him. \n\nYou are truly awful. The fact that you have not acknowledged even once that you guys had no compassion for her and expect her to just pick up her shit and move on because it\u2019s affecting you guys... I don\u2019t know why you became a mother.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine why she isn\u2019t talking to you, you seem like a real peach to converse with. \u201cEven my MIL said\u2026.\u201d Just because you found some other hollow wretched AH to echo your nonsense doesn\u2019t make it less nonsensical. I also wouldn\u2019t go around tell anyone that you managed to marry into a whole set of people who are as horrible as you are they won\u2019t be as proud of you as you are of yourself.", "She deserves better than you.", "This is so callused that I am shocked.  Like wow, wait until you experience that loss and try to look at a future without the person you planned to partner with forever.  If I was her none of you would have earned the right to be in that future.", "For everyone other than OP,  yes.  Unfortunately,  I think we were supposed to find the daughter lacking because \"she an adult.\""]}
