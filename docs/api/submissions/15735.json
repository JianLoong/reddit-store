{"id": 15735, "submission_id": "12zf8b0", "title": "AITA for not wanting to pay for the stain I made in my best friends oven?", "selftext": "I (24f) have been friends with this girl (25f) for over 12 years now. Recently she bought a house with her boyfriend and bought everything in the house brand new. Last weekend they went away for the weekend with her family and she asked me to watch her dog and house for those 3 days. Of course I said yes, also because her dog and mine are good buddies and it meant a weekend away from my family. Side note; me and her are not as close as we used to be since she got together with her boyfriend. \nIn this weekend I used her oven on the day before they got back. I couldn\u2019t find the tray, so I used the grill with paper on it, so I could bake my pizza (do this all the time at home and it went fine every single time). After I was done with the oven I noticed a bit of cheese on the bottom that fell of the pizza while baking. I totally forgot to clean it that night, so when my friend got back the next day, she noticed it. She texted me if it was me who did it and that she was upset because she had to clean it. I apologized and didn\u2019t hear from her for the next hour. Then she texted me that her whole oven was ruined and that she couldn\u2019t get the stain out. She sent a picture and saw a LOT of SCRATCHES on the bottom of the oven where she had cleaned. Now she is asking me to call my insurance for a new oven. I\u2019m stunned and don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overreacting? So, AITA for not indirectly paying for her new oven?", "created_utc": 1682510212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zf8b0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_the_stain_i_made/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, just because you use the cardboard in your own oven doesn\u2019t mean you should be doing that in other people\u2019s oven. Not all ovens heat the same way. \n\nYour friend could easily cleaned baked cheese without damaging her oven. \n\n(Next time - sprinkle salt on the cheese, let it cool & wipe it up)", "NTA. It was rude of you to not clean the oven, but whatever she did caused the scratches because she must not have followed the proper cleaning methods for the oven.", "NTA. It\u2019s not difficult to clean an oven, she really had to fuck up to damage her oven that much just from trying to get a bit of cheese off.", "ESH - You forget to clean it so youre a very minor AH for that. But she is clearly trying to take advantage of you.", "ESH: You're the ah for not cleaning the oven in the first place. She doesn't know how to clean the oven and ruined it and is an ah for wanting you to pay for her mistake.", "NTA \n\nLeaving a cheese stain happens all the time, if she doesn't know how to clean her oven without ruining it permanently she could've asked you first to come and clean it and not blamed you for something she did.\n\nLeaving a stain in a oven doesn't make anyone an ah.", "NTA. She could have asked you to pay to clean the cheese off or asked you to clean it off. The excess damage is her own fault, the crazy wally.\n\nBut for leaving g cheese, YTA.", "NTA, there are tons of cleaners to use in a oven and when an oven gets used it is eventually going to get dirty. Also how did she scratch the shit out of it. Does she not have common sense?", "\ud83d\ude02it\u2019s just a bit of cheese! Why would she even mention it to you?? You were doing her a favour and\u2026 it\u2019s just a bit of cheese!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nSure, it\u2019s now about the scratches, but they weren\u2019t needed.

One should always leave a place in the same state as when one arrives.  That's an oversight on your part that you've clearly owned.\n\nOn the other hand, a few scratches in an oven don't render it inoperable. An oven will get many more scrapes, stains, and dinks over the course of its time.  Also sounds like this friend of yours used something too abrasive to clean the oven, although, again, it's a fucking oven, not the hood of a Corvette.\n\nESH", "ESH. No, a new oven is not justified here. But you absolutely should have cleaned it yourself or offered to pay to have it cleaned professionally.", "ESH. You should have a cleaned an oven that you left a stain in, new or not. Her scratching the oven in order to clean it and then asking you for help replacing the oven is extreme.", "NTA - Yes, you should have cleaned the oven. But no, you are not responsible for whatever insane method she used to try and clean it.\n\n\"If you had asked me to come back and clean it for you, I would have been more than happy to do so. But you clearly did not follow the manufacturers instructions for cleaning the oven and I am not responsible for the damage you caused.\"", "ESH. You shouldn't have left the oven dirty,. especially when you were a guest. The GF sucks for not knowing how to clean an oven and telling you to contact your insurance.\n\nBut honestly, which kind of insurance would cover this anyway? Do you have homeowners insurance (which would be weird)? And it would be a terrible idea for the GF to put in a claim for this: I doubt it would even meet the deductible and would result in higher rates.\n\nOP, did this really happen?", "ESH\n\nso yes, you forgot to clean the oven. so that is on you. \n\nyour friend, on the other hand, damaged her own oven. is this the first time she's cleaned an oven? holy crap. cheese doesn't leave scratches. gouging at it with some sort of scraper does. so no, you shouldn't have to replace her oven.", "NTA. Sure, you should have cleaned it up, but you forgot, and you were there doing her a big favour. She probably scraped at it with steel wool or something, so she is the one who damaged her own oven.", "NTA I can understand how you did forgot it. You needed to let the oven cool down before cleaning and next day she already came back. Sure you shouldn't have left it, but one little bit of cheese if easy to clean up. \n\nIf she scratched the oven to clean some cheese, i'm pretty sure that the oven would have ended up scratched in the next weeks when she tries to clean up her own mess. And a new oven for a few scratches?! WTF?", "NTA. Should have cleaned up the cheese but in the grand scheme of things not a big deal. Your friend ruined their own oven by not cleaning it properly and that\u2019s on them. Kinda sounds like they\u2019re tryna scam their way to a new oven for some reason.", "NTA. Look, it\u2019s not great that you didn\u2019t clean up the cheese, so this would normally be an E S H moment, *but* either she or her boyfriend clearly fucked their own oven up through ineptitude and now they\u2019re panicking and trying to make you pay to fix their mistake.\n\nIt\u2019s freaking *cheese*. It does not scratch. It does not stain (ovens). The damage is what *they* did to it, and that\u2019s not on you.", "That's madness. I am a professional cleaner and organizer and have come across ovens that looked like the Hellmouth and I've been able to get them clean without damaging them. If it's a self clean over, you, obviously use the self clean. If not, oven cleaner works miracles. She must have used something extremely abrasive and not meant for oven cleaning, and that's on her.\nNTA", "NTA- sure you should have wiped it up but dang didn\u2019t you watch her dog for free. She\u2019s out of control.", "NTA. At most, you owe her a can of oven cleaner. Her not knowing how to clean an oven is not your problem.", "NTA - cooking has spills.\n\nAre you telling me in 2023 there are people without self-cleaning ovens?", "She wants you to buy her a new oven because you got some cheese in it? That's insane. NTA.", "NTA. The most she can logically demand is the cost to clean the oven.", "Text her  \"that won't be possible.\" If she threatens to take you to small claims court (which is her only real recourse) tell her that she's welcome to and then block her. If you get a court summons show up (otherwise she wins automatically) and bring the popcorn - the judge is going to think this is hysterical\n\nNTA. You were giving her three days of free house sitting and something got minor, relatively normal dirty. Those are the breaks. If she wanted your insurance to cover her damaging the oven she should have hired a professional house-sitting firm with professional insurance. \n\n.", "NTA what the **** did she clean it with that it left scratches? It\u2019s cheese, not acid. You probably should of cleaned it but it sounds like a honest mistake. It\u2019s not your fault a grown woman, with her own house doesn\u2019t know how to clean an oven. Unless of course it wasn\u2019t her but her boyfriend who scratched up the oven. She may be trying to get you to pay for a new oven for his (or her) mistake.", "NTA- Cheese is easily cleaned, even if burned, she made the scratches by using a wrong approach (metal sponge likely? or metal brush?)  and now she wants to get a new oven? Hahahahaha , cool  , nope not going to happen.", "LOL NTA you dripped cheese in her oven and she\u2019s a dunce who doesn\u2019t know how to clean", "NTA.  If it was a few strands of cheese, yeah should have cleaned it but your friend is an absolute dolt if they damaged their oven trying to clean cheese up.  That's on them.", "NTA for not paying (because that\u2019s a ridiculous request) but you should have just cleaned it up in the first place.\n\nStill, though\u2026 it\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s a dumb@ss and scratched the crap out of her new oven. Like what the hell was she doing to it???", "NTA - your friend making a mountain out of a mole hill, it's you should have cleaned up after yourself but that's not some dire situation and she's now blaming you for her scratching up the oven because she tried to clean it up improperly.", "NTA. OK it was an error on your part not to clean the oven, but it sounds like an honest mistake and not laziness and you apologised. I wouldn\u2019t even bat an eyelid or mention it to anyone who had been staying in my house, but I understand this is all new and exciting for her.\n\nHer suggestion is absurd. She has clearly scrubbed the oven with steel wool or something, not knowing what she\u2019s doing, and damaged it in the process.
