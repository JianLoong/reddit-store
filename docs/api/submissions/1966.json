I understand that as a special needs child your attention most likely always gravitates towards him, but you have another child.", "YTA.  Your daughter always gets the crumbs of your attention since her 9 year old brother functions as a 2-3 yr old.   You are dead wrong to not go on her field trip.  This is a great opportunity for her to have your undivided attention, for once in her life, without you having to deal with her brother.\nSo you remember anything from when you were 2or 3?  Most people don't.  Your son wont remember whether you attend his play.  Your daughter will remember that you again pushed her aside to show up for your  son.     \n\nIf you continue down this path, your daughter will cut ties with  you when she is older.  \n\nI understand it is difficult to be in this situation.  But just because your son has special needs doesnt mean he deserves the vast majority of your attention all the time.  Your daughter deserves some of your undivided attention as well.", "Are you planning on being there whenever your son has a meltdown?\n\nYou made a commitment to your daughter.

I get that your son will be unhappy that you aren\u2019t there, but your daughter is equally unhappy that you won\u2019t be there/ have cancelled. She will see it at \u201cmum\u2019s fine with me being unhappy but not my brother\u201d, if you choose to go to the play instead. Also, she will lose trust and stop believing any promises you make in future- which could have serious ramifications as she grows. \n\nI\u2019d guess your daughter makes a lot of sacrifices for her brother, please let her have a guilt-free fun day on a trip with her mum and without her sibling.", "YTA \n\nYou had already made a commitment to not only your daughter, but her class. Her teacher is probably now scrambling to find a replacement for you.\n\nNeurotypical/non-disabled kids often lose a lot of parent time and attention to their siblings even with the most wellmeaning parents. This probably isn't the first time she's been pushed aside for your son. Your son is cognitively 2-3 years old. He probably won't care if he sits the play out. Your daughter does care about you missing her trip.", "YTA.\n\nBecause you promised her and now you're backing out for your other child's play when the info came last minute.  He may NOT understand but your daughter sure AF does and you shouldn't constantly shove her off to the back seat for him ESPECIALLY when you've made a promise.   \n\n\nCan't your husband call off sick that day and go to the play instead?", "YTA.

She matters just as much, if not more as she will remember.", "YTA this is probably not the first time you had to cancel on your daughter to accommodate your son and it\u2019s not fair to her. Your daughter will eventually get tired (if she isn\u2019t already) of all ways being your second choice. You are making her make sacrifices to accommodate her brother. She will always remember the times you canceled or backed out because  her brother comes first in your eyes. There is no way making this up to her.\n\nIn a few years this resentment will grow to the point where she will not want nothing to do with you, her father or her brother. She will eventually go no contact with all of you. It is your job to make sure she gets equal attention.", "Soft YTA-   \nI understand the predicament you're in, but I'm sure your daughter is exhausted and I'd be willing to bet this isn't the first time where her brother came first.   \nYou committed this to her and now you're bailing and if this happens often you're going to eventually lose her.   \n\n\nAs a possible solution (who knows if it's realistic) A play can't last more than an hour, why can't his dad take his lunch break to be there?", "This is a really easy one actually. You made a prior commitment to your daughter. Your daughter and your son are, or should be, equal priorities. The previously made commitment to your daughter is what gives that obligation a higher order of importance on that day. On a more subjective level, you are breaking a promise to your daughter and definitely causing her a lot of disappointment. Does your son honestly care about a school play? From your description of your daughter\u2019s reaction, I cannot imagine that your son places as much emotional value on your presence at the school play (or even on the play in general) as your daughter does on you chaperoning her trip. So essentially you already made a commitment to your daughter, and her level of disappointment will be greater than your son\u2019s. YTA if you don\u2019t go on the field trip.", "I'm going to go with YTA. You promised your daughter that you would go first. I'm guessing she doesn't get alot of time with you without her brother and was really looking forward to it. I'm guessing she is in 5th grade. You will not have many more opportunities to go on field trips with her. Parental involvement really goes down once they get into middle school. You may come to regret not doing more stuff like that with her.", "YTA. You promised your daughter weeks ago. \n\nBecause you have a high needs autistic child, she probably gets the short end of the stick when it comes to your attention very often. I don\u2019t say this to try to guilt or shame you, but it\u2019s the nature of the beast when you have a high needs autistic child. \n\nThis means she has been looking forward to you being there for weeks on end. Now she is crushed because once again, she is the one who doesn\u2019t get the attention. You can\u2019t make it up to her, it\u2019s a one time experience. If you continue to do this, you won\u2019t have a relationship with her as she grows older.", "soft YTA\n\ni get that kids with mental disabilities have trouble with things that most people consider day to day stuff, but you're essentially telling your daughter that she matters less than your son. tough situation, but I'd try to find another person who can go to your sons school.", "YTA: It is hard to be the sibling of a child with disabilities. She likely already feels replaced and ignored. And now you're breaking the promise you made her for one game.\n\nMake arrangements for your son, and take your daughter. She NEEDS to feel loved and important to you.", "YTA. My youngest is autistic and has other disabilities as well. If I promise my oldest that I will do something, I do it unless there is an emergency. A meltdown isn't an emergency. I assume his school knows how to handle them. If you constantly choose your son over her, you are going to lose your daughter and your son will never learn that things don't always happen the way he wants. I get that it's hard, but it isn't fair for your daughter to lose out every time there is a situation where he will have a meltdown.", "If you do that often your daughter will remember she's 11 daily decisions like that will define if you have an only son in 7 years or a healthy relationship with both your children.", "Yta. You're just proving to her that the only promise you'll keep is the promise that she's never going to be your top priority.", "Sadly YTA.\n\nYou made a promise, and your daughter probably already does a lot of understanding and taking the back seat to her brother. Your daughter did not ask to have a sibling at all you and your husband chose to have two kids, their health and wellbeing and happiness should not come at the expense of one another and if it is you and your husband need to evaluate your situation.", "YTA - Sounds like both kuds are inconsolable.   His teacher messed up.  How many other parents are unable to go last minute?\n\nAs his teacher to reschedule for proper notice?  If not he may be hurt but it will pass.  Breaking your daughter's trust will be harder, if not impossible to heal.\n\nAre you a single parent?", "Oof. This is definitely a tough spot, so I say this gently: YTA. I assume (perhaps wrongly) that your daughter gets put behind your son in the priority list a lot out of necessity. That would be tough on even the most understanding kid, even if it has to be done. It sounds like she was really looking forward to getting a piece of your time.\n\nNot to sound uncaring, but although your son will be upset, he will likely forget relatively quickly.

What do you do for her that is not inclusive of her brother", "YTA but let me give you some advice because I've seen this story a thousand times and I've seen how they grow up: the \"healthy\" kid in a family with a \"sick/special needs/whatever\" kid. Years of \"well that one will understand she's strong.\" Never getting to be the center of attention for one damn second; always being pushed to sacrifice because \"your sibling is sick and you need to do this.\" Just saying; start changing the pattern now before your daughter barely speaks to you a decade from now.", "YTA. How many times has she heard \"I will make it up to you?\" - How many time have you actually made it up to her? How many sacrifices has she had to make.\n\nIs it truly impossible for your husband to take a few hours off of work or is he just unwilling or is it just inconvenient?\n\nIt is always easiest to make the child pay b/c as an adult, you can just force them to do whatever you want, but you will loose your daughter if this is always the path you take.", "YTA. This is not the first nor the last time you will always put your son above your daughter. If she cuts you off out of her in the future, don\u2019t be surprised or clueless why.", "Gentle YTA \nYou are (inadvertently) telling your child that she and something important to her matters less than your son. She was likely looking forward to having some time with just the two of you, away from the needs of her brother. \nIt is commendable that you want to support your son, but your son will be upset in the moment and your 11 year old will never forget this broken promise.", "INFO:\n\nYour daughter has legitimate needs too. \n\nQuestion - will your son remember this? After the initial inconsolable crying and possible tantrum/meltdown, will he remember long term? \n\nYour daughter will definitely remember when you placed her brother's needs over hers, for something that was planned weeks in advance. \n\nDo you have a history of cancelling on her and tending to your son? If you do, your daughter will remember all of these times. She is a child, and she will feel neglected and overlooked.\n\nIf this is a singular event, that changes things, but I suspect it is not.", "Soft YTA. As someone who is also autistic, I understand that it will be hard on your son if you\u2019re not there, but you already promised your daughter", "Soft YTA. I get that you\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place, but your daughter is never going to forget a broken promise like that.", "YTA.

Now your backing out because your son has a play.\nHow many times has your daughter asked for your time only to be turned away because of your son?\n\nI get that your son has needs but he will have the very same needs his entire life.  Your daughter also has needs and you are not even coming close to meeting them.

Oftentimes these things are more important to parents than to the kids. Can he miss it, could you arrange for a helper to come with you on the field trip. I'd skip the play, bring son on the outing and bring a helper for the son.", "Soft YTA. I bet there are very few times where you have the opportunity to put your daughter first.

Your daughter will never forget.", "INFO: do you often prioritize your son over your daughter? or is it a one-off episode?\n\nyour daughter needs you as much as he does and will grow resentful of you and her brother if you make her feel like she's a seond thought. there are many stories of people who have disabled siblings and went no-contact with families as soon as they were able because their disabled sibling was always prioritized.", "YTA.  \n\nYour daughter doesn't get to pushed aside every time your son has a something.  She deserves your time, attention, and respect, too.  \n\nKeep your word to your daughter.", "Tough one, but I think you should keep your commitment to your daughter. I might insist that your husband take time off work and go to your son's play. \n\nYour son is not more important than your daughter, and I have the feeling that she is getting the message that he is.\n\nSoft YTA", "Soft YTA. \n\nI understand your logic completely but breaking a promise to a child is a huge thing to them. Your daughter's 11, even if she can understand logically why her brother needs more attention, that is not at all going to translate to emotional understanding of the situation. \n\nYour son will be upset for a little bit but if he's 2/3 developmentally he won't even care come the next day. Your daughter will remember this for a long time. \n\nI sincerely hope that this isn't a regular occurrence because if it is you are emotionally damaging your daughter.", "YTA - I completely understand that having a child with developmental differences can be incredibly difficult and there will be times that you HAVE to break promises that you have made to your daughter. But this should not be one of those times. This is a difficult situation to be sure, but not an emergency.\n\nYour son's reaction may be harder for you to handle than your daughter's reaction, but that does not mean that her feelings matter less than your son's. \n\nTalk to your son's teacher and the other support staff at the school and let them know that this will be a tough situation for him to handle. Work with them to come up with a plan for how to prepare him for you not being there in advance and things they can do in the moment if he gets upset. \n\nIf you are not ever willing to make your daughter a priority, then stop making promises you will not keep. Be honest with her and tell her that you can only be there for her if and when your son doesn't need something also.", "Idk, I feel as if this cancelation stuff is a common occurrence then you're definitely a huge A.H. But I mean if he's got the functionality of a 2-3yr old he's not really going to understand why you're not there, you're not there on a typical school day so yeah. If this type of stuff rarely happens then N.T.A to not go with your daughter.

She'll do this again and again to her daughter just because he's special needs.

If not, then maybe it is time to problem solve some other solutions for when you can't be in two places at once. Maybe a nanny for your son who can \"pinch hit' for you in these situations?
