Your daughter always gets the crumbs of your attention since her 9 year old brother functions as a 2-3 yr old.   You are dead wrong to not go on her field trip.  This is a great opportunity for her to have your undivided attention, for once in her life, without you having to deal with her brother.\nSo you remember anything from when you were 2or 3?  Most people don't.  Your son wont remember whether you attend his play.  Your daughter will remember that you again pushed her aside to show up for your  son.     \n\nIf you continue down this path, your daughter will cut ties with  you when she is older.  \n\nI understand it is difficult to be in this situation.  But just because your son has special needs doesnt mean he deserves the vast majority of your attention all the time.  Your daughter deserves some of your undivided attention as well.", "Are you planning on being there whenever your son has a meltdown?\n\nYou made a commitment to your daughter.

I get that your son will be unhappy that you aren\u2019t there, but your daughter is equally unhappy that you won\u2019t be there/ have cancelled. She will see it at \u201cmum\u2019s fine with me being unhappy but not my brother\u201d, if you choose to go to the play instead. Also, she will lose trust and stop believing any promises you make in future- which could have serious ramifications as she grows. \n\nI\u2019d guess your daughter makes a lot of sacrifices for her brother, please let her have a guilt-free fun day on a trip with her mum and without her sibling.", "YTA \n\nYou had already made a commitment to not only your daughter, but her class. Her teacher is probably now scrambling to find a replacement for you.\n\nNeurotypical/non-disabled kids often lose a lot of parent time and attention to their siblings even with the most wellmeaning parents. This probably isn't the first time she's been pushed aside for your son. Your son is cognitively 2-3 years old. He probably won't care if he sits the play out. Your daughter does care about you missing her trip.", "YTA.\n\nBecause you promised her and now you're backing out for your other child's play when the info came last minute.  He may NOT understand but your daughter sure AF does and you shouldn't constantly shove her off to the back seat for him ESPECIALLY when you've made a promise.   \n\n\nCan't your husband call off sick that day and go to the play instead?", "YTA.

Your daughter will eventually get tired (if she isn\u2019t already) of all ways being your second choice. You are making her make sacrifices to accommodate her brother. She will always remember the times you canceled or backed out because  her brother comes first in your eyes. There is no way making this up to her.\n\nIn a few years this resentment will grow to the point where she will not want nothing to do with you, her father or her brother.

You made a prior commitment to your daughter. Your daughter and your son are, or should be, equal priorities. The previously made commitment to your daughter is what gives that obligation a higher order of importance on that day. On a more subjective level, you are breaking a promise to your daughter and definitely causing her a lot of disappointment. Does your son honestly care about a school play? From your description of your daughter\u2019s reaction, I cannot imagine that your son places as much emotional value on your presence at the school play (or even on the play in general) as your daughter does on you chaperoning her trip. So essentially you already made a commitment to your daughter, and her level of disappointment will be greater than your son\u2019s. YTA if you don\u2019t go on the field trip.", "I'm going to go with YTA. You promised your daughter that you would go first. I'm guessing she doesn't get alot of time with you without her brother and was really looking forward to it. I'm guessing she is in 5th grade. You will not have many more opportunities to go on field trips with her. Parental involvement really goes down once they get into middle school. You may come to regret not doing more stuff like that with her.", "YTA. You promised your daughter weeks ago. \n\nBecause you have a high needs autistic child, she probably gets the short end of the stick when it comes to your attention very often. I don\u2019t say this to try to guilt or shame you, but it\u2019s the nature of the beast when you have a high needs autistic child. \n\nThis means she has been looking forward to you being there for weeks on end. Now she is crushed because once again, she is the one who doesn\u2019t get the attention. You can\u2019t make it up to her, it\u2019s a one time experience.

She likely already feels replaced and ignored. And now you're breaking the promise you made her for one game.\n\nMake arrangements for your son, and take your daughter. She NEEDS to feel loved and important to you.", "YTA. My youngest is autistic and has other disabilities as well. If I promise my oldest that I will do something, I do it unless there is an emergency. A meltdown isn't an emergency. I assume his school knows how to handle them. If you constantly choose your son over her, you are going to lose your daughter and your son will never learn that things don't always happen the way he wants. I get that it's hard, but it isn't fair for your daughter to lose out every time there is a situation where he will have a meltdown.", "If you do that often your daughter will remember she's 11 daily decisions like that will define if you have an only son in 7 years or a healthy relationship with both your children.", "Yta. You're just proving to her that the only promise you'll keep is the promise that she's never going to be your top priority.", "Sadly YTA.\n\nYou made a promise, and your daughter probably already does a lot of understanding and taking the back seat to her brother. Your daughter did not ask to have a sibling at all you and your husband chose to have two kids, their health and wellbeing and happiness should not come at the expense of one another and if it is you and your husband need to evaluate your situation.", "YTA - Sounds like both kuds are inconsolable.   His teacher messed up.  How many other parents are unable to go last minute?\n\nAs his teacher to reschedule for proper notice?  If not he may be hurt but it will pass.  Breaking your daughter's trust will be harder, if not impossible to heal.\n\nAre you a single parent?", "Oof. This is definitely a tough spot, so I say this gently: YTA. I assume (perhaps wrongly) that your daughter gets put behind your son in the priority list a lot out of necessity. That would be tough on even the most understanding kid, even if it has to be done. It sounds like she was really looking forward to getting a piece of your time.\n\nNot to sound uncaring, but although your son will be upset, he will likely forget relatively quickly.

What do you do for her that is not inclusive of her brother", "YTA but let me give you some advice because I've seen this story a thousand times and I've seen how they grow up: the \"healthy\" kid in a family with a \"sick/special needs/whatever\" kid. Years of \"well that one will understand she's strong.\" Never getting to be the center of attention for one damn second; always being pushed to sacrifice because \"your sibling is sick and you need to do this.\" Just saying; start changing the pattern now before your daughter barely speaks to you a decade from now.", "YTA. How many times has she heard \"I will make it up to you?\" - How many time have you actually made it up to her? How many sacrifices has she had to make.\n\nIs it truly impossible for your husband to take a few hours off of work or is he just unwilling or is it just inconvenient?\n\nIt is always easiest to make the child pay b/c as an adult, you can just force them to do whatever you want, but you will loose your daughter if this is always the path you take.", "YTA. This is not the first nor the last time you will always put your son above your daughter. If she cuts you off out of her life in the future, don\u2019t be surprised or clueless why.", "Gentle YTA \nYou are (inadvertently) telling your child that she and something important to her matters less than your son. She was likely looking forward to having some time with just the two of you, away from the needs of her brother. \nIt is commendable that you want to support your son, but your son will be upset in the moment and your 11 year old will never forget this broken promise.", "INFO:\n\nYour daughter has legitimate needs too. \n\nQuestion - will your son remember this? After the initial inconsolable crying and possible tantrum/meltdown, will he remember long term? \n\nYour daughter will definitely remember when you placed her brother's needs over hers, for something that was planned weeks in advance. \n\nDo you have a history of cancelling on her and tending to your son? If you do, your daughter will remember all of these times. She is a child, and she will feel neglected and overlooked.\n\nIf this is a singular event, that changes things, but I suspect it is not.", "Soft YTA. As someone who is also autistic, I understand that it will be hard on your son if you\u2019re not there, but you already promised your daughter", "Soft YTA. I get that you\u2019re stuck between a rock and a hard place, but your daughter is never going to forget a broken promise like that.", "YTA.

Oftentimes these things are more important to parents than to the kids. Can he miss it, could you arrange for a helper to come with you on the field trip. I'd skip the play, bring son on the outing and bring a helper for the son.", "Soft YTA. I bet there are very few times where you have the opportunity to put your daughter first.

Your daughter will never forget.", "INFO: do you often prioritize your son over your daughter? or is it a one-off episode?\n\nyour daughter needs you as much as he does and will grow resentful of you and her brother if you make her feel like she's a seond thought. there are many stories of people who have disabled siblings and went no-contact with families as soon as they were able because their disabled sibling was always prioritized.", "YTA.  \n\nYour daughter doesn't get to pushed aside every time your son has a something.  She deserves your time, attention, and respect, too.  \n\nKeep your word to your daughter.", "Tough one, but I think you should keep your commitment to your daughter.

Your daughter will remember this for a long time. \n\nI sincerely hope that this isn't a regular occurrence because if it is you are emotionally damaging your daughter.", "YTA - I completely understand that having a child with developmental differences can be incredibly difficult and there will be times that you HAVE to break promises that you have made to your daughter. But this should not be one of those times. This is a difficult situation to be sure, but not an emergency.\n\nYour son's reaction may be harder for you to handle than your daughter's reaction, but that does not mean that her feelings matter less than your son's. \n\nTalk to your son's teacher and the other support staff at the school and let them know that this will be a tough situation for him to handle. Work with them to come up with a plan for how to prepare him for you not being there in advance and things they can do in the moment if he gets upset. \n\nIf you are not ever willing to make your daughter a priority, then stop making promises you will not keep. Be honest with her and tell her that you can only be there for her if and when your son doesn't need something also.", "Idk, I feel as if this cancelation stuff is a common occurrence then you're definitely a huge A.H. But I mean if he's got the functionality of a 2-3yr old he's not really going to understand why you're not there, you're not there on a typical school day so yeah. If this type of stuff rarely happens then N.T.A to not go with your daughter.

My parents did their best, but I missed out on A LOT of things because of my brother and his needs.  I'm a grown ass adult, and I'm over it, but when I was your daughters age (and well into my teenage years) I was very angry at the unfairness of it all. \n\nLet me run through a few things.  All of this was when I was in middle school to high school.  Things were different once I matured more.  I've lost friendships because my house was always about my brother so any time friends visited they were uncomfortable.  Therefore almost every friend I had growing up, we always spent time at their house not my house. \n\nEvery event in my life has had to be altered because of my brother.  Even my college graduation, my mom didn't get to see me walk the stage because she had to leave the auditorium with my brother (he had a tantrum because of how long it was).  After the ceremony, I wanted to go out to eat at a fancy(ish) restaurant.  Instead we had to go to a pizza place because the nice restaurant didn't have anything he would eat. \n\nI don't want you to think that I don't love my brother, I REALLY do.  I have always believed that after my parents can no longer take care of him, he would come live with me.  This is not something my parents forced me to do, it's just what I've always wanted.  My college girlfriend broke up with me because of that, I was REALLY hart broken about it because I loved her a lot.  It's been 20 years and I totally understand how she might not have been OK taking that kind of responsibility on in the future, but at the time I was just destroyed. \n\nWe we were young, there were no family vacations (we could otherwise have afforded them) because of the issues around my brother being in a strange place.\n\n(This one still stings)  My grandparents took all of my cousins on trips at various times.  They were fairly wealthy, much more so than my family, and took big extravagant trips every year and often would bring a few of my cousins along.  They never took me, and I never really understood why I was never asked. Often I'd not find out about these trips until afterword's. \n\nMuch later in life I found out that my grandparents were not OK with accepting the level of responsibility that taking my brother on such a trip would entail.  Since they (grandparents) didn't think it would be fair to take one brother and not the other, I was simply never asked.\n\nYou might wonder why I never asked to go.  The simple answer is the family culture around money.  You never asked and only accepted things that were offered.  To ask would be considered rather rude.  Eventually I found out because one of my aunts told her child (my cousin) and she told me.  This caused me a lot of hurt because I feel like I really missed out on some valuable life experiences. To give you an idea of the size of these trips, the cousin that told me had gotten to go to Egypt for 3 weeks, another got 6 weeks touring eastern Europe, a third went to Australia for 2 months. \n\nI've had a lot of therapy for these issues, I'm OK now and still love my brother.  There was DEFINATLY a time in my life when I spent about 10 years avoiding home because of him.\n\nNow after reading about my experiences I want you to read what you've just told your daughter.  \"I'm sorry I can't do the totally normal mother daughter experience you were very much looking forward to.  Your little brother is disabled do I have to do his thing otherwise he'd be sad\"\n\nHow do you think that makes her feel about him? Also I grantee this is not the first such occurrence.

Your daughter on the other hand will remember this on a very likely long list of times her needs were shoved aside because her special needs brother needed all the attention. Kids who have special needs siblings often end up extremely resentful of their parents. It\u2019s because their childhood ends up being taken over by their siblings needs and they are then pushed to always be understanding as if they don\u2019t have needs themselves. Then worse yet, they are often pushed into a secondary caretaker role in order to give the parents a \u201cbreak\u201d constantly. It almost always ends with the kid being resentful and wanting to leave home ASAP and going low contact with their family because of the burden that got placed on them unfairly. \n\nYour daughter needs your undivided attention sometimes too.

Not going to her trip is the logical choice, as she is developmentally and cognitively equipped to understand that she is better placed to not have you there than her brother is.

There\u2019s no question. If your son is developmentally a 3 year old, he will not remember this at all in a few weeks. He might be cold and unreceptive for a few hours after you pick him up after school if you missed this. If you come to him with a little gift, something you know he likes and which will redirect his thoughts from his hurt, he will get over it even sooner. I say this as a behavioural psychologist. Your son is being cared for in a school specialising in his circumstances, and unless there is a danger to his health, a *potential* tantrum is not reason enough to drop everything and run. You need to allow him to learn some coping mechanisms, which do not solely revolve around you being his crutch. For his sake and your family\u2019s sake, and most especially for your own sake.

Yes, having a child with a disability is difficult. However, there is no excuse for breaking promises to your other children for something the NV child will not remember in a day or two. OP wants us all to sympathise with her, knowing her behaviour is poor. Stop using your child\u2019s disability as an excuse OP.

I'm sure not ALL parents will be there and if it's made clear in advance, or not mentioned at all, he will be fine. I understand why you feel you must be there, but unfortunately this time your daughter is already booked in with you. You are not going to be able to be there every single time for your son, you both will come to no harm from that.", "YTA, you made a promise to your daughter and now you are showing her that she can\u2019t trust you and she\u2019s not a priority.\n\nShe\u2019s going to go NC with you as an adult and I don\u2019t blame her", "This is a terrible situation but I gotta say YTA till further information is given. I get the temptation to be there for your son more but you said yourself, your son is mentally 3 at most. He's likely not even going to remember whether or not you were there. Your daughter is 11 and NT. She is going to recognize and remember you not being there. She is keeping track of how many times she feels she is unfairly pushed aside for her brother.

Your son probably won't even notice you aren't in the audience at the play until after the play, so he will at least get to enjoy the play before any meltdown happens.  Maybe you can get a grandparent or friend he trusts to show up for him.  Also if he is developmentally 2-3 years old, he won't remember the play in a few months.  But your daughter will always remember how you made her feel by prioritizing her brother over her.  You promised your daughter and you need to keep your promises, even if it means upsetting your son (who I am guessing has pretty frequent meltdowns no matter what you do).  Sadly, your son is never going to be able to have a normal life.  But your daughter can.  Don't ruin her life or her relationship with her brother by never putting her first.

Left it to our paternal grandparents. My grandma and my grandpa are more my parents than anyone. Even starting to feel that way when it comes to my husbands family. My parents lack of parenting has made me not see my immediate family as family. You will have a very bad relationship with your daughter when shes older. You wont be involved like you expect to be if you continue putting one kids needs above the other. Shape up mom. Hes mentally a toddler, toddlers have tantrums, you gotta let them have the tantrum and not give into their whims.

Not only is she completely neglecting the emotional needs of her daughter, she's also seriously holding her son back. She tosses out there that her son is autistic and only developmentally 2-3 years old like it's that simple, but its not. *Everyone*, not just people with developmental delays, develop at different rates for all aspects of their person. So branding him as 2-3 years old is misleading. I knew a girl who had very little speech capabilities, her emotional development was around a toddler and her \"book smarts\" were kindergarten/1st grade. But she was 13  and her \"street smarts\" were at that level, and she was a bully to her caregivers because they held her to what she was capable of, while surface level connections and new people she acted sweet with to get out of stuff. I am not, by any means, saying that it what is happening with OP and her son, I'm just highlighting why branding her son as 2-3 developmentally can be very misleading. What has become very common, however, is parents adopting this level of their child's ability, and then never pushing them beyond that. They forever accept that their child is going to be 2-3, and in doing so actually hold them back from the ability to grow when it could have otherwise been possible. Which is a huge disservice to their son, and ads a ton of unnecessary issues when the parents can no longer care for him. He may be perfectly capable of taking care of himself with some outside support, or living in a community that gives him the supports he needs, while still promoting his independence wherever possible. But instead, it's more likely he ends up in a total care facility because they won't have ever taught him any ways to help himself. Be it how to feed himself, or how to cope with things not going the way he needs. \n\nThe other problem that is glaring right in the face, is that mom has claimed he is developmentally 2-3 years old. My kid is 2. Does she want me there for everything? Sure, of course she does. But we have never given her the expectation that I will be there for everything. We are fortunate that there are people in our lives that could go in my stead, like my husband or mom, but even if we didn't, there would still be things that it was necessary I miss. And my 2 year old can handle it. Does it suck infinitely more teaching a 2 year old something, especially if they're emotional about it? Of course it does, they're 2. But that doesn't make it impossible. The son here is delayed to 2-3 years old, not a 2-3 year old delayed, but 2-3 years old developmentally. Therefore, if a 2-3 year old should usually be expected to have a certain ability, then the son should as well. She's not just teaching her daughter here to always expect the son to come first, she's also teaching it to the son.

Is there a reason that instead of being shoved in a play that will make him cry is more important than his sister? Why can\u2019t he sit with an aid and play games in a room for an hour where he doesn\u2019t have to be exposed to meltdown fuel? \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: mom and dad are going to have to realize that he\u2019s not going anywhere. He will be with them for his entire adulthood unless he\u2019s not put in an alternative living situation as an adult. There WILL be times that they can\u2019t watch him without sacrificing work events, graduations, engagement parties, weddings, funerals, sporting events that might be overwhelming, etc., and they have to learn to work around those times. Otherwise, they\u2019re telling their daughter through their actions that her feelings, accomplishments, and events are less important that her brother. \n\nThis is a great time to start looking for real solutions! There are wonderful babysitters with qualifications for special needs, aids at school, nurses, etc. It\u2019s time to look for people outside of mom and dad who can help support their son so he\u2019s not ALWAYS the number one priority. They have two kids, and she shouldn\u2019t always be playing second fiddle to her special needs brother.  It\u2019s hard, they will feel guilty initially, but they absolutely must learn to find alternative resources if they want a good relationship with their NT child in her adolescence and adulthood.\n\nEdit: removed extra \u201cfeelings\u201d", "Or it will be something picked up considering his needs.\nLike, I don't know, a pool filled with balls when the girl hates those.", "Codependent family dynamics.

In her absence, she has asked me to go a time or two because she doesn't want her kids being out and about while under-supervised.

So, not only is this a negative for the daughter, it will also become a long term negative for the son. He may have a disability, but with help he can learn to cope with things better.

For years I watched my mom tend to every need and drive literally hundreds of miles at the drop of a hat to bring something he needed to whatever facility he was at at the time. His anger was so bad and he's bigger, so by the time he was 14/15, everything went to shit.

I'm Neuro-Divergent (ND) and an only child. I have a TON of cousins and some have autism, I just have a \"spectrum disorder\" that used to be called Asperger's. So I'm highly verbal, have some \"weird\" type of memory (photographic memory type), and I'm clumsy unless I'm very mindful - as in I bounce off of walls, doorframes, furniture, etc. unless I really focus on my physical presence. I also lose my grip on things easily, or grasp too hard. Went through a whole set of drinking glasses before my parents bought thicker glasses - I crushed more than I dropped. Anyhow - watching the siblings of my cousins with autism get saddled with the care of the ND child was infuriating. They didn't get to be kids, and to be fair, neither did the ND kids. But that was a long time ago before much was known about the ways of working with the ND tendencies and teaching coping skills. OP (& hubs) needs to join a support group and also the daughter. I DON'T think OP is TAH but her daughter sure does and as others have pointed out, that anger and disappointment usually gets displaced to the other sibling. \n\nOP - NTA but daughter won't agree and may understand but the sting is still there. Without knowing the son, it's hard to say if OP is misjudging the son's ability to understand the situation. \n\n**COOL IDEA HERE -->** Perhaps the father can record the play and they can make a big deal out of watching the play together. Our little local movie theater let's you rent out a screening room - wouldn't it be cool if the son could be the star of the movie and it could be played for any parents or relatives who miss the play? Not just OP but also open to friends/relatives of other students? That way the sister also gets to participate? And the son doesn't feel left out or \"inconsolable\"??", "I\u2019m also in that part of the spectrum, and this sounds like an amazing idea. It could even become a family activity, they could start making little movies starring kids and the family, that\u2019d be a heck of a bonding experience! I\u2019m just imagining the little guy having all these little movies to show guests and friends, assuming he was into it, and who knows what that could blossom into. \n\nI\u2019m also really tired though so I kinda let my imagination run wild. It\u2019s all really cute in my head.", "That's a really cool idea, and thank you for sharing all of that story and info here. I agree OP is NTA, and I actually think NAH, because nobody is winning here. Mom is stressed being full time parent in both mom and dad roles to both daughter and ND son, dad is always working, daughter is always ignored.

I say this as an autistic person growing up in a situation where everyone, especially the kids from the other (neurotypical) families at school, hated me for getting \"special treatment\" that wasn't even unfair to the others.
