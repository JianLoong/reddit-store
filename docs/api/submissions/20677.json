His parents were totally ineffective and just kept saying \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201c and not doing anything to restrain him. Then he asked if he could pet my rat. I said no. He got this shocked look on his face and yelled at me \u201cbut I asked nicely!!\u201d Then he tried to get into the rat cage anyway and I stopped him and told him and my aunt and uncle they had to leave. They were all very offended that I had the audacity to enforce my boundaries but I did not care\u2026 My rat is my baby and I\u2019m not letting anybody be mean to him, ever.", "Mom is a panhandler letting the kid do the panhandling. Vile. Fwiw, panhandle kept typing up as panda-ing.\ud83d\ude02", "The scariest thing about people like these is that they are putting their own children in danger. You never know how a person will react to being asked for money or if it might be some sort of child predator.", "YES YES YES, although I\u2019m a jaded, cynical Southerner.  She was panhandling in comfy air conditioning with lil panhandler junior. They will jingle like Santa and his sleigh at the end of the day.", "I\u2019m all for giving things to the needy but the vibe I got was maybe the mom was teaching the kid to grift/panhandle for her and felt he would only learn if they started small. Generally I also don\u2019t give a fuck about panhandlers who aren\u2019t overzealously harassing people but I gotta say possibly using the kid to do it feels incredibly scummy and exploitive.\n\nETA: also, as someone else mentioned, the food court would have almost certainly given them a cup of water for free.", "You\u2019re exactly who that woman and her panhandling kid are looking for, lol. Fyi, I believe the only change given at the machine is 25cents, and it beats the heck out of working, in her mind.", "I wouldn\u2019t have, and that\u2019s totally fine.", "You don\u2019t have to be a member to enter the store.", "I was thinking it was one of those that fill the 5 gallon water cooler jugs, cause those are still a quarter a gallon.", "He didn\u2019t want the water, he wanted the money. And if you bought him the water, he or his mom would just sell it outside.", "I was once asked how far along I was, I said I'm not pregnant this is what having 2 C-sections (and food) has done to my stomach and laughed.", "I don't know about that. The fact that OP felt they had to ask here is telling. There is a perception that if someone asks you for something, especially a kid, you're the bad guy if you don't give it. Asking someone for something immediately puts them in a position of feeling they should give it, or would have to justify not giving it. Some people, as OP mentioned, find that very hard to do. Some people may not want to share their really good reasons (which for a lot of people right now are going to be needing to watch literally every penny). I've had a kid come up to me while I was eating at a pub and ask me to take my \"pretty ring\" (topaz and diamonds) off for them to play with, and I got dirty looks for not pausing my meal to just hand my inheritance from my grandmother to a virtual toddler.", "It took me a LONG 10 seconds and reading that twice to get that! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Hilarious though.", "So real! Centuries ago I used to work in a kids store in a mall where a 6-year-old (the kid of another store's worker) would come in every day with loose change he had found or gotten for little chores. Sometimes it was enough to buy candy, sometimes it was a little short and we let him take it anyway. His mom eventually asked us to be more strict so he'd eat less candy and could learn about money a bit more. He was a good kid so didn't complain, he'd just come back when he found more money. A couple weeks later he's a few cents short and I send him packing. He said okay and ran off. No problem. But there was a man in line behind him who then tries to lecture me about how it was only a few cents I should have let him have the candy. Did he ever offer to pay the difference for the kid since it was just a few cents and it was morally right? No, apparently this injustice was all on me, a teenage retail worker. I politely explained that the mom had asked us not to and he said, \"Still.\"", "I was doing a parade, and as part of my schtick, I had a puppet that I used to interact with the crowd. It was a rat dressed as a pirate, and I had a kid who walked up to me with his hands out, expecting me to give it to him. I said no and walked on. The screams behind me were pretty amazing.", "Queen Victoria made that mistake, and people still haven't learned better!", "We were taught to never, ever reference a potential pregnancy unless she's told you or you can see the baby's head crowning.", "Maybe if they look super pregnant some fat shaming to get them to reconsider that fifth cake is in order", "I think that's what the Mormons say.", "You joke but this kinda actually happened to someone I met at a party once.\n\nOne night she started getting bad stomach pains.  She took painkillers but they just got worse and worse and eventually her husband hauled her down to the hospital.  After hearing her description of the pain, the nurses said \"Ok off to maternity with you,\" and she said \"I'm not pregnant.  I had my last period 3 weeks ago.\"  1 pregnancy test and 2 hours later, she had a full term baby girl in her arms.", "I wear braces on my hands that look like jewelry and I work with the public. Trust me, it can hurt the tenth time I have to explain that I got them from an OT, then say they keep my joints where I need them, then because my connective tissue doesn\u2019t work quite right, then yes it does hurt if I don\u2019t wear them."]}
