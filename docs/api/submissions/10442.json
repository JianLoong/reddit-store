I 100% hit the jackpot but not for the reason you might think.  \n\nI met a young woman, Claire, through my sister last year. They went to college together and they are good friends.  I thought that she was incredibly beautiful when I saw her but I was trying my best not to be the creepy older brother hitting on his little sister's friends. We talked a little bit and I asked her about her work since graduating. She gave me a weird look but told me about working in the medical field. I thought it was very interesting work from the sounds of it. After they left my dad made fun of me for not asking her out. \n\nMy sister called me last January out of the blue and said I was probably good to contact her friend and ask her out. She said she even put in a good word for me. And that I was going to need it. \n\nSo I started talking to Claire and we went out for lunch. She is very beautiful like I said. She is also very smart and driven. She has a future all planned out. I jokingly said I was interested in being part of that future. She said my sister had already half convinced her I was a good idea. \n\nWe had a few more dates and then we made it official. It's been over a year since our first date and my family loves her and my friends all think I fluked into the greatest relationship ever. \n\nAnyways the party. Whenever I talk about Claire I mention her work. She studied child psychology and is working on her Master's. See, smart. I love bragging all about how she is making the world a better place. \n\nAt the party my friend started joking around about her being able to make more money as a model or something. I told my friend he was being an ass talking about her looks and he should drop it. He did not.  \n\nHe even started making beauty and the beast comments. He was rude but never vulgar. Just rude. \n\nHe wouldn't. Drop it. He may have been a little jealous and drunk. She finally went on her phone and showed him some pictures of herself in the uniform from the job she does for fun.  She is a cheerleader for a sports team. She then told him how little the job pays. She spent time explaining to him that she competed in cheer in college and it was a hard sport and that she only auditioned for the professional squad because they do a lot of work with children's charities. She said that she was tired of people like him thinking all she had to offer was her looks.  He got embarrassed and left. \n\nHe called me up later and said I was an asshole for not telling him I'm dating a cheerleader. I said I'm not. I'm dating Claire, a woman who is in her way to being a child psychologist. He said that I should have told him so he wouldn't have been such an sss about her looks.  \n\nI don't think it's my place to tell people. She doesn't tell everyone. \n\nSo he's pissed at me for not telling him. He's upset with her for telling him so publicly. I think he was behaving like an ass and should have dropped it when I said so.", "created_utc": 1676897007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1175py4/aita_for_not_telling_a_friend_of_mine_what_my/", "score": 10057, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I was in uni for psychology/neuropsychology there was an absolutely stunning woman in our class. The rest of us weren't hideous, but she was otherworldly beautiful truly. She worked as a model before and during school, because that was an option for her, not because beautiful people absolutely have to have a job relating to their looks.

Definitely not \"this is Silje, the model\".", "NTA\n\nI'm really not understanding why he is acusing you and why youre feeling guilty.\n\nAre you used to be gaslighted and manipulated?

Furthermore if you're told to drop it, then it's even more not okay.\n\nAlso, there was nothing wrong with not telling him. No one is obliged to tell people anything they don't want to. The way she told him is also no issue, in fact it's a pretty polite way to get him to stop, ie by opening his eyes and correcting instead of screaming at him or anything like that.

Whether or not he's doing that consciously or unconsciously is a diff question.\n\nCongrats on dating an absolute queen.", "NTA, dude you rock!!

Child psychology is generally associated with high EQ I think(?), and not high IQ. It\u2019s confusing to applaud her for being smart so broadly, and also can lead to people feeling you\u2019re putting them/their strengths/achievements down or saying it\u2019s not meaningful.\n\nWhile that is smart and noble work she\u2019s in, I fully agree in supporting your gf, putting her on a pedestal overall is a bit much. This shouldn\u2019t be a main topic amongst everyone you know, don\u2019t you think? Imho Please stop putting your gf on a pedestal, it\u2019s great you appreciate her. Just make sure you focus on yourself and are also equally proud of yourself. Making her out like a trophy on a stand makes you a bit of an AH if it\u2019s to the point your friends are reacting this badly. \n\nHaving dated a guy who put me on a pedestal (not on my beauty lol) was really uncomfortable after a while, didn\u2019t feel real and things did mess up. It put a lot on me to be relatable and myself, not come across someways. I normally get along with anyone, and so it wasn\u2019t so bad but I had to deal with some weird dynamics with some of his friends. It was hard to be real, when my friends all appreciate me for that actually. And some of his thought I was somehow intellectually superior, which some like and we had great connections\u2026and I sensed others did not. For him to see my flaws too and me as a real person was scary and difficult. I told him to stop repeatedly but I guess he thought I was self conscious and he was showing me I\u2019m worth it. Which is not me at all lol. I\u2019m just private mostly and easy going as possible. There were the true parts in our relationship that stood out and deeply felt, without him kinda fawning about me. I really wished it would stop or get toned back. He ended up putting himself down (the other edge of the sword), and I was straddled with building him up. Which worked, so well he felt he needed to explore options with his new found confidence since I suddenly was the reason he didn\u2019t achieve his goals (previously I was the reason he became himself and his potential). Meanwhile I burned out from never getting real support (because he was busy seeing me as the strong ambitious smart one). I needed out anyway. \n\nIt needs to be balanced, just adding it here in case your post is something to go by. My ex was ready to get married year 1, i loved the idea but really didn\u2019t see us doing any of it. It\u2019s about partnership. I was dying inside waiting for him to stop fawning and build reality with me first so I bought time working on the foundations - but man am I glad it ended. Looking back it is funny we thought with absolute certainty he had hit the jackpot and I had blossomed and finally got someone who supports me and was teaching me a lot on the emotion side (EQ). I was actually just trying to believe his illusion, we were actually stagnating under his praise. I guess. Let it be a cautionary tale, the honeymoon phase gets old and needs to integrate into reality. Feet on the ground, head in the clouds\u2026don\u2019t float away in daydreams and fantasy\u2026this is your reality now. She\u2019s human and has real needs and her own way to present herself to the world. Make sure you respect that too. Do you see her really? Are you building a life with her or around her? Is your presence putting her on the spot? Does she want the spotlight you\u2019re casting around her? Is this public discussion about how awesome she is sustainable representation of who she is, and work for you two long term(it\u2019s been a year now)\u2026? Are your friends able to know her and see past your cloud of smoke you\u2019re seemingly puffing around her? If she\u2019s fire, people will see for themselves\u2026don\u2019t be her narrator/groupie. It doesn\u2019t sound like you feel equal to her, eventually you may question if you can be her partner if you don\u2019t take time to accept you already are. Is this how that will go?\n\nTL/DR: This level of fawning ain\u2019t hot. Tone it down.", "NAH-you said it perfectly.

This post proves that good looking people have problems too!!    \nLike... people teasing you and telling you that you should be a model for work--can you even imagine how humiliated you'd feel!?!", "Yeah I\u2019m an LMFT and the last year was basically working for free and meeting up to talk about it. Then several more years of busting my ass for pennies until I got licensed.", "For the love of all mankind, have your kiddo parley competitive cheer into a bid at a good university, then segue into law school so that she can single-handedly break the trust Varsity holds over the sport.", "We don\u2019t refer to ourselves that way, though. I only mark \u201chealthcare\u201d on forms asking my job if there\u2019s not an option for mental healthcare or social services."]}
