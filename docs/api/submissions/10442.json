I 100% hit the jackpot but not for the reason you might think.  \n\nI met a young woman, Claire, through my sister last year. They went to college together and they are good friends.  I thought that she was incredibly beautiful when I saw her but I was trying my best not to be the creepy older brother hitting on his little sister's friends. We talked a little bit and I asked her about her work since graduating. She gave me a weird look but told me about working in the medical field. I thought it was very interesting work from the sounds of it. After they left my dad made fun of me for not asking her out. \n\nMy sister called me last January out of the blue and said I was probably good to contact her friend and ask her out. She said she even put in a good word for me. And that I was going to need it. \n\nSo I started talking to Claire and we went out for lunch. She is very beautiful like I said. She is also very smart and driven. She has a future all planned out. I jokingly said I was interested in being part of that future. She said my sister had already half convinced her I was a good idea. \n\nWe had a few more dates and then we made it official. It's been over a year since our first date and my family loves her and my friends all think I fluked into the greatest relationship ever. \n\nAnyways the party. Whenever I talk about Claire I mention her work. She studied child psychology and is working on her Master's. See, smart. I love bragging all about how she is making the world a better place. \n\nAt the party my friend started joking around about her being able to make more money as a model or something. I told my friend he was being an ass talking about her looks and he should drop it. He did not.  \n\nHe even started making beauty and the beast comments. He was rude but never vulgar. Just rude. \n\nHe wouldn't. Drop it. He may have been a little jealous and drunk. She finally went on her phone and showed him some pictures of herself in the uniform from the job she does for fun.  She is a cheerleader for a sports team. She then told him how little the job pays. She spent time explaining to him that she competed in cheer in college and it was a hard sport and that she only auditioned for the professional squad because they do a lot of work with children's charities. She said that she was tired of people like him thinking all she had to offer was her looks.  He got embarrassed and left. \n\nHe called me up later and said I was an asshole for not telling him I'm dating a cheerleader. I said I'm not. I'm dating Claire, a woman who is in her way to being a child psychologist. He said that I should have told him so he wouldn't have been such an sss about her looks.  \n\nI don't think it's my place to tell people. She doesn't tell everyone. \n\nSo he's pissed at me for not telling him. He's upset with her for telling him so publicly. I think he was behaving like an ass and should have dropped it when I said so.", "created_utc": 1676897007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1175py4/aita_for_not_telling_a_friend_of_mine_what_my/", "score": 506, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He just wants someone else to blame because he doesn't want to accept the responsibility of his own actions. That's something he should have been taught growing up.", "NTA, but your \"friend\" is. He's a creep.", "NTA, this seems like your girlfriends decision to tell whomever whatever and she made her decision. All you did was be a good boyfriend and stand up for her.", "NTA. It would have been a whole lot safer for him not to make an ass of himself about her looks by not being an ass about her looks ever. That should be a blanket policy!", "NTA. All he did, he did to himself. As such, he only has himself to blame for it.", "NTA-Why should it be your job to \u201cprep\u201d him so doesn\u2019t come off looking like the AH?", "NTA. Shame works and he did it to himself. Maybe next time he will think before he speaks. Maybe explaining to your friend that he should be careful before putting his foot in his mouth and maybe he can get as lucky as you but with that attitude he will not get many women at all. It's a great learning and teaching experience.", "NTA - your friend is being SO shallow, and could never hit the jackpot like you have, because you're interested in character and you respect your girlfriend. he clearly has no idea what either of those entails.", "NTA. \"he wouldn't have been such an sss about her looks.\" He should listen to himself and realize he shouldn't be rude without having to be told.", "NTA - act like an ass and only has himself to blame.", "He may have been drunk but he was most certainly jealous.\nClaire has more to offer the world than her looks but he is so shallow he couldn't see beyond that.

Your friends the AH", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" is a creep, and a massive asshole for that beauty and the beast shit. When I was in uni for psychology/neuropsychology there was an absolutely stunning woman in our class. The rest of us weren't hideous, but she was otherworldly beautiful truly. She worked as a model before and during school, because that was an option for her, not because beautiful people absolutely have to have a job relating to their looks. You know how I'd describe her to strangers? As one of the smartest, sweetest people I know. Definitely not \"this is Silje, the model\".", "NTA\n\nI'm really not understanding why he is acusing you and why youre feeling guilty.\n\nAre you used to be gaslighted and manipulated? Because, i'm really not understanding why he is upset with you AT ALL.", "NTA, and quite frankly your friend is a huge asshole. No matter what someone does for fun or professionally, making jokes like that is not okay. Furthermore if you're told to drop it, then it's even more not okay.\n\nAlso, there was nothing wrong with not telling him. No one is obliged to tell people anything they don't want to. The way she told him is also no issue, in fact it's a pretty polite way to get him to stop, ie by opening his eyes and correcting instead of screaming at him or anything like that. He's calling u an ass because he's blaming you for the incident he was in... Whether or not he's doing that consciously or unconsciously is a diff question.\n\nCongrats on dating an absolute queen.", "NTA, dude you rock!!
