{"id": 24888, "submission_id": "15twwsy", "title": "AITA for kicking my bf out for choosing his mother over me and lying about it?", "selftext": "I (23F) and my boyfriend (30M) have been together for 2 years, living together for a little over 1. We had moved in together roughly 6 months into our relationship and agreed to split everything 50/50. After about 2 months of living together, he started being very short on cash. By that I mean he would ask me to send him money for lunch when he was at work on numerous occasions. At the time, he made more money than me (I had 2 jobs and was still just barely making what he made with one FT job) and I was concerned as to why he couldn\u2019t afford anything throughout the month. He revealed at this point that he was paying his mothers half of her rent as well. He said that this was the deal he had to make with her in order for him to move in with me. I did not know this before moving in or I wouldn\u2019t have asked. I made a reddit post regarding this actually, in which I was deemed asshole due to us not being married and he can do what he wants with his cash as long as mine and his bills were paid. I accept that. that\u2019s fair. \n\n\nthis did not stop as time went on but we managed. I started picking up dinners, and lunches, and groceries\u2026 you name it. some time went by and he started mentioning wanting to buy his mother a house. I told him that he can\u2019t even afford cat food, how is he gonna afford a house? under his name? it didn\u2019t make sense to me, but again as long as my bills were covered he can do what he wants\u2026. until they weren\u2019t. he began to delay rent significantly. i\u2019m talking 2-3 weeks late on rent/utilities consistently. eventually he told me hed be behind on rent for 2.5 months because he couldn\u2019t pay, due to him paying all the closing costs and down payment on this house for his mom. for context, at this point I didn\u2019t even KNOW he had dropped money on it. he never told me until after it was already done, papers signed and money dropped. he even told me he had to withdraw his 401k savings from his job in order to meet half of the down payment. I told him I was uncomfortable with that and he said he didn\u2019t have a choice, therefore I didn\u2019t have a choice. he was late on that payment too, I did not receive june OR july bills until the last week of july. \n\nwe also haven\u2019t been on dates, he can\u2019t take me out because he gives all his money to his mom. he can\u2019t buy groceries, can\u2019t pay bills on time, and won\u2019t make time for me unless we\u2019re under the same roof. so.. I kicked him out. however he is trying to make me feel bad about it because I should be supporting him, I should support this decision and be more \u201cempathetic\u201d as he put it. because he \u201cneeded\u201d to do this as a debt he owes to his mom for bringing him to the states 5 years ago. \n\nthere have been other things in between, bickering fights and whatnot regarding money and him not spending time with me. I get home from 12 hour shifts to find a dirty house and him on the playstation, so that also adds to the frustration on my part.\n\nso AITA for kicking my boyfriend out for choosing his mother and this house over me, my well-being and our bills?", "created_utc": 1692300060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15twwsy/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out_for_choosing_his/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has put his mother first. Not only that he is depending on you to front him or pay his way while his priorities are with his mom", "NTA, he used you. Yes its his money and yes he can do what he wants with it, but no when hes prentending to be broke and have you spend your money on him. He should be an ex and you should file a civil case to get your money back.", "NTA he asked for it", "NTA\n\nHe can live with his mother. He told you his priorities. They aren't going to change.", "Well , if you have been called YTA before, prepare because now the answer is NTA. Since he wants to help so much his mom, he can go live with her and then help her buy a house, then you decide if you want him back. So much time lost and money lost because he is stubborn..", "NTA, best thing you can do is letting this momma's boy go, his mother will always come first be it financial or mentally. You can do better.", "NTA", "Your supporting  him, means you are supporting his mother, since he is not paying his share of the bills.\n\nShe is not your relative.  You should not be forced into supporting you/\n\nHe has chosen his mother over you.  He can live her.\n\nNTA", "Job well done.  NTA.", "NTA,  show him the door and he can go live with his mommy. You need an equal partner.", "NTA. For a guy supposedly showing so much gratitude to his mother, he was excessively ungrateful to his girlfriend who was doing and helping so much. His mother is his responsibility not yours. And *he* is not your responsibility to support. You did the right thing to kick him out.", "NTA that whole situation sounds messy and you have no obligation to be a part of it. Good for you.", "NTA\n\nSoooo he would make you provide for him because he has to provide for his mom? That is not a partner with whom you can build a life, it's totally reasonable if you don't want to sign up for this", "NTA seems like he just wanted you to be his backup ATM basically. I would just block him", "NTA\n\n\"He said that this was the deal he had to make with her in order for him to move in with me. I did not know this before moving in or I wouldn\u2019t have asked.\"\n\nExsqueeze me, a grown ass man had to make a deal with mommy to move in with his girlfriend at if I am doing the math right 28.\n\nRun. Run fast and never turn around. This woman will haunt every aspect of your life if you stay with this child.\n\nRegardless of the fact that he has lied to you repeatedly.", "NTA he's using you to support so that he can support his mom. This will likely never change. You made the right decision. I don't even know you got judged the AH in your last post considering that he kept asking you for money. Yes, it's his money, he can do what he wants with it. But that applies to you as well. You shouldn't have to be giving him money bc he's giving his money to someone else. That doesn't even make sense.", "NTA - He can live with his mom.", "NTA. IMO.", "NTA!", "NTA  You don't need that crap in your life.", "NTA. He\u2019s supporting his mom and you\u2019re supporting him. That\u2019s not what you signed up for!", "YTA for taking internet advice the first time and not just getting rid of this dude. Listen, this sub is basically all teenagers and neckbeards advising people to do wild shit that nobody would ever do in real life. You\u2019d have been better off asking a magic 8 ball. \n\nNow text your scam artist, con man, mamas boy loser and tell him that the relationship is over and you\u2019re going to yeet his shit on the lawn.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were right to kick that AH.", "You did the right thing he's just using you", "NTA. He can do whatever he wants with his money as long as his portion of the bills are paid. Once he couldn\u2019t do that and it became your problem kicking him out was the right thing to do. He was using you.", "Nothing to add to this. If he has money to buy a house, but no money to pay the rent, he might as well move to that very house, so you wouldn't have to pay bills for a grown ass man, who earns more than you do.    \nIt sounds a bit as if OP were dating my ex."]}
