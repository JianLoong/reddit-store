{"id": 24888, "submission_id": "15twwsy", "title": "AITA for kicking my bf out for choosing his mother over me and lying about it?", "selftext": "I (23F) and my boyfriend (30M) have been together for 2 years, living together for a little over 1. We had moved in together roughly 6 months into our relationship and agreed to split everything 50/50. After about 2 months of living together, he started being very short on cash. By that I mean he would ask me to send him money for lunch when he was at work on numerous occasions. At the time, he made more money than me (I had 2 jobs and was still just barely making what he made with one FT job) and I was concerned as to why he couldn\u2019t afford anything throughout the month. He revealed at this point that he was paying his mothers half of her rent as well. He said that this was the deal he had to make with her in order for him to move in with me. I did not know this before moving in or I wouldn\u2019t have asked. I made a reddit post regarding this actually, in which I was deemed asshole due to us not being married and he can do what he wants with his cash as long as mine and his bills were paid. I accept that. that\u2019s fair. \n\n\nthis did not stop as time went on but we managed. I started picking up dinners, and lunches, and groceries\u2026 you name it. some time went by and he started mentioning wanting to buy his mother a house. I told him that he can\u2019t even afford cat food, how is he gonna afford a house? under his name? it didn\u2019t make sense to me, but again as long as my bills were covered he can do what he wants\u2026. until they weren\u2019t. he began to delay rent significantly. i\u2019m talking 2-3 weeks late on rent/utilities consistently. eventually he told me hed be behind on rent for 2.5 months because he couldn\u2019t pay, due to him paying all the closing costs and down payment on this house for his mom. for context, at this point I didn\u2019t even KNOW he had dropped money on it. he never told me until after it was already done, papers signed and money dropped. he even told me he had to withdraw his 401k savings from his job in order to meet half of the down payment. I told him I was uncomfortable with that and he said he didn\u2019t have a choice, therefore I didn\u2019t have a choice. he was late on that payment too, I did not receive june OR july bills until the last week of july. \n\nwe also haven\u2019t been on dates, he can\u2019t take me out because he gives all his money to his mom. he can\u2019t buy groceries, can\u2019t pay bills on time, and won\u2019t make time for me unless we\u2019re under the same roof. so.. I kicked him out. however he is trying to make me feel bad about it because I should be supporting him, I should support this decision and be more \u201cempathetic\u201d as he put it. because he \u201cneeded\u201d to do this as a debt he owes to his mom for bringing him to the states 5 years ago. \n\nthere have been other things in between, bickering fights and whatnot regarding money and him not spending time with me. I get home from 12 hour shifts to find a dirty house and him on the playstation, so that also adds to the frustration on my part.\n\nso AITA for kicking my boyfriend out for choosing his mother and this house over me, my well-being and our bills?", "created_utc": 1692300060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15twwsy/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out_for_choosing_his/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has put his mother first. Not only that he is depending on you to front him or pay his way while his priorities are with his mom", "NTA, he used you. Yes its his money and yes he can do what he wants with it, but no when hes prentending to be broke and have you spend your money on him. He should be an ex and you should file a civil case to get your money back.", "NTA he asked for it", "NTA\n\nHe can live with his mother. He told you his priorities. They aren't going to change.", "Well , if you have been called YTA before, prepare because now the answer is NTA.

Sometimes the judgements in this sub are spectacularly off.\n\nThe fact your ex is so invested in his relationship with his mum is not the issue (a little odd, perhaps, but not in itself problematic, especially if they come from a more communal culture). What is not ok is that he expects you to subsidise his costs so he can spend unsustainable amounts of money on his mum.\n\nHey, at least you didn't have to live with her.

If you get no say in how he spends his money (which is fair), he gets no say in how you spend yours either (so he shouldn't have expected you to cover his lunches). But that's irrelevant now. I wish you well!", "Agreed. I think if you can pay your own rent, then kick him out. He isn\u2019t respecting you when he doesn\u2019t pay and makes this huge financial decisions that impact you and your relationship. You basically are taking care of a child. He can buy groceries, pay rent, take you out on dates, NO! I get dates are not a necessity and we have postponed going out right now Fido to our household income but I still assist with feeding myself and the kids and paying for my own gas. He is not acting like an adult. You deserve someone who acts like an adult and not a mama\u2019s boy through and through.\nEDIT: he is 30!!! Just no. These are not decisions made by a successful 30 year old male. I don\u2019t see a big future here to be honest.", "he\u2019s been kicked out for 10 days now and he\u2019s been begging to come back and trying to guilt trip me saying he\u2019s depressed and that he can\u2019t sleep without me blah blah blah\u2026 and yeah if he was short on money because he was covering things for us, different story. but knowing he\u2019s covering things for his mom with the money is infuriating", "NTA.
