Today, in the afternoon, my mother, who I haven't talked to since I was 11, reappeared on the doorstep of my home with her 5 year old son.

After the divorce, my mother cut contact (not sure, my dad always denied that she was in contact with him) and she never talked to me again.

I found it in his office at my home one afternoon when he was at work.\n\nEver since the divorce, my dad became very absent and absorbed in work/relationships. So one day, I was able to go on a trip with another adult without the knowledge of my brother or dad to travel to where my mom resided, and I was appearing on her doorstep without her knowledge too.

You most certainly do not owe her an apology. I'm sorry you're in this situation. It must be very difficult.\n\nFor the record, her abandoning her children is not a small thing. That is a huge huge thing.", "INFO Sorry, but your story doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. There seems to be a layer of information missing from the proceedings. Your confusion and anger are understandable, but I would recommend finding a trusted adult to help you navigate what\u2019s actually happening with your parents and their expectations of you.", "NTA. Intitled to the way you feel. No apology", "They're all delusional. Where the hell is their empathy?", "If you are referring to why she would do this out of nowhere, I have no idea but I think it's because she had another son to take care of. Otherwise, I don't know what other information could be missing.", "Why did your mom leave? Why did your father hide her info? Why did she abandon you when you visited? If your father is protecting you why was he upset when you closed the door on her? Is she interested in a relationship with you? How does your father feel about her now? What does she want?", "I don't know why she left tbh. I suspect it's because she gave birth to another boy around 11 months after she divorcer my dad. So she probably had another relationship? But that's a huge assumption.\n\nMy dad didn't like talking about her for some reason. Whenever I talked about her, he'd either change the subject, not talk at all or get mad at me. So i don't talk about her to him ever. Yeah, i don't know, they never sat me down and talked about their relationship. They always left me in the dark. Me and my dad don't exactly talk much. We barely have conversations, maximum 1 per week. And no, i don't know if she wants to talk to me again, I haven't let her explain why she came at all. It was an impulsive thing.", "Fire back at your dad and brother. Tell them all those questions you have, they left you in the dark, if anything they are the AHs. Until they and your mom fill you in on what happened and answer your questions nobody gets an apology. And also, they should be apologizing to you, mom abandoned you physically, dad abandoned you emotionally.", "Back to my original response, y\u2019all need some help.. a mediator or a therapist or someone to facilitate conversations that would unlock all of you from the walls that have been built between you.", "I don't know, I am not that brave. I kinda don't wanna lose my dad too. He always runs away from serious discussions. Thank you though. Maybe one day.", "NTA. In what universe is abandoning a small child at a public place a small thing? It sounds more like a \"scar-you-for-life\" and \"give-you-trust-issues\" type of thing.", "NTA. Wait a minute, let's pretend that your whole trip to visit her did not happen, then we have:\n\n-Your parents divorced and your mom stopped contacting you and your dad apparently hid you from her\n\n-Your mom, out of nowhere, decides to visit and pretends to enter the home???\n\n-Your brother and dad get mad at you for not letting her in, am I missing something??\n\n\nEdit: format", "NTA. You don't want anything to do with her. Your feelings are perfectly valid. If or when you choose to seek her out, it'll be on your terms. Not hers or anyone else. She was the one who wronged you.", "That was not a \u201csmall thing\u201d. She abandoned you at a park. Even if you were to ignore the emotional trauma that would do, she put you in physical danger.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm suprised your Dad is upset with you. He should still be angry with her.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't even there to see you, but to talk to your Dad.\n\nThe heck with all of them.  You do you and let them sort out their own crap.", "NTA. First of all, you are not \u201cacting like a child\u201d you are a child. A child who was abandoned by his mother not once, but twice. Your behavior is not up for critique here. These adults need to start taking responsibility for this mess that is ENTIRELY of their own creation.", "NTA", "NTA - you have no guarantee she'll stick around. If dad or bro want a relationship with her then that's their business. She literally abandoned you in a park after walking out, that is some peak AH behaviour. Turns out if you're a shitty parent your kid might want nothing to do with you.", "Yeah... she has not spoken to him in 5 years after literally abandoning him. Seems like a small thing to me /s", "NTA. You most certainly do not owe her an apology.", "She doesn't even owe her an apology if they do tell her the truth! Don't use an apology as a bargaining chip.", "Fine, but at least refuse to apologize. You must show some backbone after all of this."]}
