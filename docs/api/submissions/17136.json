Today, in the afternoon, my mother, who I haven't talked to since I was 11, reappeared on the doorstep of my home with her 5 year old son. So my mother divorced my father when I was 11 and when my brother was around 18, I guess? After the divorce, my dad got my custody and my mother cut contact (not sure, my dad always denied that she was in contact with him) and she never talked to me again. I would pester my dad again and again about her because I missed her. But my dad did hide the address of where she lived which was in a city nearby. I found it in his office at my home one afternoon when he was at work.\n\nEver since the divorce, my dad became very absent and absorbed in work/relationships. So one day, I was able to go on a trip with another adult without the knowledge of my brother or dad to travel to where my mom resided, and I was appearing on her doorstep without her knowledge too. So when she saw me, she was happy, nice, introduced me to her newborn son, and then she abandoned me at a park and I had to call the adult who i travelled with to pick me up. I tried being optimistic but obviously, I was pretty dead.\n\nNow she appears on the doorstep. I ask her what she is doing here and why she is here. She is saying she wanted to talk to my dad. I don't know, but a sudden surge of anger consumed me that I just...shut the door and ignored the doorbell. \n\nMy dad called me and yelled at me. My brother too. They both were very mad and wanted me to apologise to her. They said I was being a child, holding a grudge for a small thing she did years ago, and that I needed to make an apology.\n\nSo AITA? Should I apologise for being in the wrong?\n\nEdit no 1: I just realised I omitted one detail. My dad knew nothing about the time i got left at a park, i didn't bother telling him. I felt like it would be a waste because he already doesn't talk to me. I didn't want more distance.\n\nEdit no 2: So I found out he was already in contact with her. He just didn't tell me for some stupid unknown reason. He invited her over. That's why she was there. He told me that over lunch. He then said he'd call her over again in a few hours and I'd have to apologise to her. I didn't say anything about it. \n\nSome of you asked some questions so:\n- yes, i agree, if this detail of him being in contact with my mother was not revealed to me, then there is probably a lot i wasn't told.\n\n- i will think about talking to my brother. i also feel like he knows a lot because he was an adult when the divorce happened so he probably knew. however he also lives in another city so that's why he isn't around either. \n\n- i told my dad about me being abandoned at the park. He said my mom was going through a lot especially when she just got a new kid and that's probably why she left me there. He said that wasn't okay but it was a long time ago and I am ok now so it doesn't matter anymore. That's probably the longest convo i have had with him in years, hilariously enough.\n\nThank you for the supportive responses. I think my 11 year old self would have liked them.", "created_utc": 1683990296, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gjw7s/aita_for_not_letting_my_mom_enter_my_home/", "score": 528, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You most certainly do not owe her an apology. I'm sorry you're in this situation. It must be very difficult.\n\nFor the record, her abandoning her children is not a small thing. That is a huge huge thing.", "INFO Sorry, but your story doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. There seems to be a layer of information missing from the proceedings. Your confusion and anger are understandable, but I would recommend finding a trusted adult to help you navigate what\u2019s actually happening with your parents and their expectations of you.", "NTA. Intitled to the way you feel. No apology", "They're all delusional. Where the hell is their empathy?", "If you are referring to why she would do this out of nowhere, I have no idea but I think it's because she had another son to take care of. Otherwise, I don't know what other information could be missing.", "Why did your mom leave? Why did your father hide her info? Why did she abandon you when you visited? If your father is protecting you why was he upset when you closed the door on her? Is she interested in a relationship with you? How does your father feel about her now? What does she want?", "I don't know why she left tbh. I suspect it's because she gave birth to another boy around 11 months after she divorcer my dad. So she probably had another relationship? But that's a huge assumption.\n\nMy dad didn't like talking about her for some reason. Whenever I talked about her, he'd either change the subject, not talk at all or get mad at me. So i don't talk about her to him ever. Yeah, i don't know, they never sat me down and talked about their relationship. They always left me in the dark. Me and my dad don't exactly talk much. We barely have conversations, maximum 1 per week. And no, i don't know if she wants to talk to me again, I haven't let her explain why she came at all. It was an impulsive thing.", "Fire back at your dad and brother. Tell them all those questions you have, they left you in the dark, if anything they are the AHs. Until they and your mom fill you in on what happened and answer your questions nobody gets an apology. And also, they should be apologizing to you, mom abandoned you physically, dad abandoned you emotionally.", "Back to my original response, y\u2019all need some help.. a mediator or a therapist or someone to facilitate conversations that would unlock all of you from the walls that have been built between you.", "I don't know, I am not that brave.

First of all, you are not \u201cacting like a child\u201d you are a child. A child who was abandoned by his mother not once, but twice. Your behavior is not up for critique here.

You live with your dad sounds like so yeah could have called for your dad to talk to her even if you didn't want anything to do with her. But that's how I was raised. Your situation is different.

Because even if you snuck off to that city, a child can be forgiven for making a desperate choice to find his MOTHER but once she had you, she ignored her absolute RESPONSIBILITY to keep you SAFE and actually you could have been harmed or worse. \n\nIf you don't feel safe enough to speak it, write it, and hand him the paper.

It sounds as if you felt your dad withheld communication between you and your mom, is that right?

Was it a family member, parent, etc\u2026? How did you know them? Was there a sexual element to it?\n3. Did your dad and brother WANT her to come back? Why did she only want to talk to your dad? Who is the father of her 5 year old? Was there an event they believe was the catalyst of you not wanting anything to do with her or are they seriously so delusional that they believe her abandoning her child is a \u201cminor\u201d thing?\n\nNote that these questions don\u2019t matter to my NTA vote but I\u2019m trying to find some humanity in these ghouls, which is probably pointless.

We aren't terribly close lmao. He doesn't tell me anything so i can't really decipher the underlying feelings he has.
