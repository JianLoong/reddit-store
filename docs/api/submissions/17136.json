So my mother divorced my father when I was 11 and when my brother was around 18, I guess? After the divorce, my dad got my custody and my mother cut contact (not sure, my dad always denied that she was in contact with him) and she never talked to me again. I would pester my dad again and again about her because I missed her. But my dad did hide the address of where she lived which was in a city nearby. I found it in his office at my home one afternoon when he was at work.\n\nEver since the divorce, my dad became very absent and absorbed in work/relationships. So one day, I was able to go on a trip with another adult without the knowledge of my brother or dad to travel to where my mom resided, and I was appearing on her doorstep without her knowledge too.

I tried being optimistic but obviously, I was pretty dead.\n\nNow she appears on the doorstep. I ask her what she is doing here and why she is here. She is saying she wanted to talk to my dad.

Should I apologise for being in the wrong?\n\nEdit: I just realised I omitted one detail. My dad knew nothing about the time i got left at a park, i didn't bother telling him.

You most certainly do not owe her an apology. I'm sorry you're in this situation. It must be very difficult.\n\nFor the record, her abandoning her children is not a small thing. That is a huge huge thing.", "INFO Sorry, but your story doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. There seems to be a layer of information missing from the proceedings. Your confusion and anger are understandable, but I would recommend finding a trusted adult to help you navigate what\u2019s actually happening with your parents and their expectations of you.", "NTA. Intitled to the way you feel. No apology", "They're all delusional. Where the hell is their empathy?", "If you are referring to why she would do this out of nowhere, I have no idea but I think it's because she had another son to take care of. Otherwise, I don't know what other information could be missing.", "Why did your mom leave? Why did your father hide her info? Why did she abandon you when you visited? If your father is protecting you why was he upset when you closed the door on her? Is she interested in a relationship with you? How does your father feel about her now? What does she want?", "I don't know why she left tbh. I suspect it's because she gave birth to another boy around 11 months after she divorcer my dad. So she probably had another relationship? But that's a huge assumption.\n\nMy dad didn't like talking about her for some reason. Whenever I talked about her, he'd either change the subject, not talk at all or get mad at me. So i don't talk about her to him ever. Yeah, i don't know, they never sat me down and talked about their relationship. They always left me in the dark. Me and my dad don't exactly talk much. We barely have conversations, maximum 1 per week. And no, i don't know if she wants to talk to me again, I haven't let her explain why she came at all. It was an impulsive thing.", "Fire back at your dad and brother. Tell them all those questions you have, they left you in the dark, if anything they are the AHs. Until they and your mom fill you in on what happened and answer your questions nobody gets an apology. And also, they should be apologizing to you, mom abandoned you physically, dad abandoned you emotionally.", "Back to my original response, y\u2019all need some help.. a mediator or a therapist or someone to facilitate conversations that would unlock all of you from the walls that have been built between you.", "I don't know, I am not that brave. I kinda don't wanna lose my dad too. He always runs away from serious discussions. Thank you though. Maybe one day.", "NTA. In what universe is abandoning a small child at a public place a small thing? It sounds more like a \"scar-you-for-life\" and \"give-you-trust-issues\" type of thing.", "NTA. Wait a minute, let's pretend that your whole trip to visit her did not happen, then we have:\n\n-Your parents divorced and your mom stopped contacting you and your dad apparently hid you from her\n\n-Your mom, out of nowhere, decides to visit and pretends to enter the home???\n\n-Your brother and dad get mad at you for not letting her in, am I missing something??\n\n\nEdit: format", "NTA. You don't want anything to do with her. Your feelings are perfectly valid. If or when you choose to seek her out, it'll be on your terms. Not hers or anyone else. She was the one who wronged you.", "That was not a \u201csmall thing\u201d. She abandoned you at a park. Even if you were to ignore the emotional trauma that would do, she put you in physical danger.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm suprised your Dad is upset with you. He should still be angry with her.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't even there to see you, but to talk to your Dad.\n\nThe heck with all of them.  You do you and let them sort out their own crap.", "NTA. First of all, you are not \u201cacting like a child\u201d you are a child. A child who was abandoned by his mother not once, but twice. Your behavior is not up for critique here. These adults need to start taking responsibility for this mess that is ENTIRELY of their own creation.", "NTA", "NTA - you have no guarantee she'll stick around. If dad or bro want a relationship with her then that's their business. She literally abandoned you in a park after walking out, that is some peak AH behaviour. Turns out if you're a shitty parent your kid might want nothing to do with you.", "Yeah... she has not spoken to him in 5 years after literally abandoning him. Seems like a small thing to me /s", "[removed]", "She doesn't even owe her an apology if they do tell her the truth! Don't use an apology as a bargaining chip.", "Fine, but at least refuse to apologize. You must show some backbone after all of this.", "NTA, absolutely NTA.\n\nBut both your parents are. You mom for abandoning you not once but twice, and then showing up at the door like nothing ever happened and asking for your father. And your father for abandoning you emotionally and calling your mother\u2019s neglect \u201ca small thing that she did years ago\u201d. Both clearly have no clue about parenthood.\n\nI feel sorry for both you and your brother, even though he seems to deal with it differently than you do.", "\"They said I was being a child, holding a grudge for a small thing she did years ago.\"\n\nAbandoning your child is not a small thing. Doing it twice is not a small thing.\n\nYou have the bad luck of having two assholes for parents. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You are 16. Yes a teen but very much still a child.  Tell your dad and brother about the abandonment. I have a feeling they\u2019ll change their tune about mom after they hear she abandoned an 11 yr old alone at the park.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d tell your dad you\u2019re not supposed to answer the door or let strangers in the house but then I\u2019m petty like that. There\u2019s definitely more to the story than they are telling you. You have every right to be upset at your mother for abandoning you twice.", "NTA She chose every single day not to contact you. It wasn't one decision years ago. Tell your dad about the park. Ask what type of person does that to a kid and why the kid should feel safe letting it into his house.", "NTA \n..You're...You're 16..you are a kid still. ? You live with your dad sounds like so yeah could have called for your dad to talk to her even if you didn't want anything to do with her. But that's how I was raised. Your situation is different. To me it looks like you were..not an Ashole just emotional. I would apologize though and tell your dad about her leaving you in the park.", "NTA but both your parents suck. And I\u2019m sorry you stuck in the middle", "NTA. What the fuck is wrong with your family?", "I'm so sorry. I hope one day you find the love you deserve.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry that both your parents seem to have let you down big time, you deserve better. Are you able to talk to your brother about what happened at the park? Would he be able to talk to your dad on your behalf to calm things down?", "you gotta tell your dad about the park. it\u2019s important. nta.", "NTA.  She abandoned you when you were a child and then, when you find her on your own, she abandons you again. Then she shows up at your house and demands to talk to your father. You didn't want to see her, didn't want her in your house, and you shut the door. You should have told your dad about it. \n\nYou do not owe her an apology.", "INFO:  Why do they (Father and bro) think her going NC with you is \"a small thing?\"", "NTA\n\ni offer you an internet hug and hope it brings you fortitude on your way forward.", "NTA\n\nBut show your Dad this post or tell tim everything.", "Wait, so your mom walked out on your family to go start another one, and ditches you when you surprise her.  But then shows up on your doorstep demanding to deal with her ex husband, who is basically no contact with her... And your dad is mad that you were rude to her?", "Take a \u201ctrip\u201d into the desert or mountains. When she gets out to take pictures, drive off.", "yeah, there's a lot that we're not being told here", "Abandoning at age 11 in a PARK in a strange city. \ud83e\udd14  NTA op. Your mom, dad, and brother ARE.", "I agree, but I also think that with the OP's age, OP is also not being told a lot.", "u/ExcitingEventl is a comment stealing bot. Original by u/HammerOn57", "Tell your dad that as soon as he gives you a full understanding of WHY your mother abandoned you, and then abandoned you AGAIN in a park in a strange city at the age of 11, you'll reconsider giving her an apology.\n\nUntil then, BOTH of them are and have been mentally and emotionally abusive to you, and THEY BOTH owe YOU a sincere apology AND family counseling.\n\nIn addition, SHE put you in REAL PHYSICAL, DANGER as a young child. Because even if you snuck off to that city, a child can be forgiven for making a desperate choice to find his MOTHER but once she had you, she ignored her absolute RESPONSIBILITY to keep you SAFE and actually you could have been harmed or worse. \n\nIf you don't feel safe enough to speak it, write it, and hand him the paper. Better yet, write it and seal it in an envelope as her \"apology \" letter.\n\nEdit to add: The feelings of your parents are NOT your responsibility, but what they've done to you IS their responsibility."]}
