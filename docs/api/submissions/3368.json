I teach history at the middle school they go to, although I have never had them. While I have never had them in the classroom, everything I\u2019ve heard from my co-workers checks out with what I know about them as neighbors.\n\nMaxton is a good kid, he plays 4 sports, has great grades and him and his friends (I have had some of his friends) are sweet boys. The biggest complaint I\u2019ve heard about him is he thinks Axe body spray is an appropriate replacement for deodorant. Kinsleigh is the complete opposite of her brother, I\u2019ve had multiple complaints about her from other students, has mediocre grades, and is far from an athlete (she is very good at her own things though, like drawing and making TikToks). Their parents are pretty entitled at times and spoil their kids, this isn\u2019t an issue for me unless the kids are mean. Maxton has many thousands and thousands of dollars in sports stuff, but he never shows it off to brag, but because he loves sports so much. Kinsleigh likes to showcase her family\u2019s wealth. Most families in the area are incredibly wealthy, including their family. I can only afford to live here because my, also incredibly wealthy parents help cover most of my bills. \n\nThe public schools in this area are good, but the private schools are even better. A lot of parents here send their kid to Catholic or private school once they hit high school. My neighbors wanted to send their kids to one of the best schools in the area, and there is an admissions test that is taken before they can be approved, and a kid needs to reach a certain score on it. The school has a wide variety of classes on sports like sports history and sports broadcasting, so Maxton really wanted to get in because he wants a career in sports. \n\nA few months ago, the parents of the kids asked me to tutor them, at first I agreed to tutor both. A few weeks into the school year, Kinsleigh had got herself in pretty severe trouble after her and her friends got caught sending homophobic DMs to other students, including calling a male student with a boyfriend the f slur. Maxton was one of the boys who exposed the girls for doing this.\n\nAfter this incident, she wouldn\u2019t apologize and was being rude to me and others, so I told her parents that I would not be tutoring her anymore, there was some pushback from them but nothing too much.\n\nA few days ago, right before Thanksgiving, the kids took the test. Maxton\u2019s score was high enough to get into the school, Kinsleigh did not. \n\nI got a text from the mother after the results came back, she told me what happened and said she wanted to speak with me when they got home. I talked to them and she accused me of trying to \u201ctear the kids relationship apart\u201d and said I was encouraging Maxton to \u201cbe a snitch\u201d by \u201crewarding him for tattling\u201d, Maxton will still be going to the school next year and is very excited.

Haha that's modern teaching for you; child messes up and fails but according to the parents it's \"your fault.\"", "NTA\n\nA lot of superfluous information here. You didn\u2019t want to tutor a kid and chose not to do it. The kid did some \u201cextracurricular\u201d activity instead of studying and didn\u2019t get into the private school.\n\nNot your job, not your problem.\n\nCould they come back at you if you tutored her and she still didn\u2019t get in? What are they going to do?", "NTA, but consider taking a large step back from this family. So many red flags.", "NTA - Even though you knew both kids you still tutored both.  Kinsleigh was the one that put herself in this situation by being rude to you.   As far as her mother, the mother is Kinsleigh just older.

Even if K wasn\u2019t being an entitled brat, you had every right to not tutor her", "Clearly NTA.  This was a situation that the parents should have managed, not you.  I'm sure you are not the only tutor in town, if you refused to tutor the girl, they could have found someone else for her.  Remind the mother of that.\n\nThe daughter did something you did not agree with AND was rude to you.  There was no basis to continue the tutoring relationship.", "Did the boy come to you before ratting on his sister?  Even if he did ask you for advice, I would still say you're not the asshole because what the sister said was horrible.

If someone is of bad character, its better to avoid spending any time with them or even helping them unless they clear up their act. The parents can accuse whatever they want to but you could potentially say that you have standards and those failing to meet the basic human decency levels shall not be tutored by you. Cut off the contacts with the neighbors than get into unwanted arguments as it barely leads to anything good.", "NTA. Money doesn't equal class and that mom and daughter certainly show it...\n\nHope the boy turns out ok w a mom like that.", ">and said I was encouraging Maxton to \u201cbe a snitch\u201d by \u201crewarding him for tattling\n\n**NTA**  That right there was confirmation that disinclination to continue with Kinsleigh was the right choice.   Her mom blames Maxton for Kinsleigh's issues rather than addressing her actual misdeeds and follow-on behavior.    It's probably a good thing that they will be going to different schools so he can get some relief from being associated with his sister.   I would be very concerned about the way he is treated within the family if she's berating him for being a stand-up kid.", "NTA. This family sounds awful. Homophobia is a massive red line and it sounds like her mother is condoning it. You should be able to tutor whoever you like and you can choose to or not to for any reason. I don't think you should, unless you desparately need money", "Need more infor? I'm going with NTA, though.\n\nDid they pay you to tutor their children, or did you do so without compensation? I think that's key here? Its a sad fact of life that educators sometimes have to deal with kids who aren't very appealing in their personality quirks and flaws. Regardless of their lack of polish at school, you have to treat them equally and share your talents with them equally. In your private life, putting up with an ill behaved kid is something you get to decide for yourself whether or not you want to be bothered. \n\nSo, if they paid you and you kicked Kinsleigh to the curb - then that's not OK, IMO. But, if people asked you to put up with their not nice kid out of the goodness of your heart - then you get to ignore the kid who behaves like a jerk.\n\nPersonally, I would have stopped tutoring both of them because oftentimes when kids screw up and are offensive and disrespectful, I figure they need more of their parents' attentions and less of mine, after school hours.\n\nBut, Kinsleigh not being prepared is her parents' problem. Lots of us have hired tutors for our kids. Tutoring costs money so we as parents expect our kids to focus and invest in their performance. \"You have to focus and work hard toward this goal, or you won't qualify for the high school programs you want or be with your friends if they get into a better school.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
