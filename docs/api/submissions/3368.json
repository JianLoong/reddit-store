While I have never had them in the classroom, everything I\u2019ve heard from my co-workers checks out with what I know about them as neighbors.\n\nMaxton is a good kid, he plays 4 sports, has great grades and him and his friends (I have had some of his friends) are sweet boys. The biggest complaint I\u2019ve heard about him is he thinks Axe body spray is an appropriate replacement for deodorant. Kinsleigh is the complete opposite of her brother, I\u2019ve had multiple complaints about her from other students, has mediocre grades, and is far from an athlete (she is very good at her own things though, like drawing and making TikToks). Their parents are pretty entitled at times and spoil their kids, this isn\u2019t an issue for me unless the kids are mean. Maxton has many thousands and thousands of dollars in sports stuff, but he never shows it off to brag, but because he loves sports so much. Kinsleigh likes to showcase her family\u2019s wealth. Most families in the area are incredibly wealthy, including their family. I can only afford to live here because my, also incredibly wealthy parents help cover most of my bills. \n\nThe public schools in this area are good, but the private schools are even better. A lot of parents here send their kid to Catholic or private school once they hit high school. My neighbors wanted to send their kids to one of the best schools in the area, and there is an admissions test that is taken before they can be approved, and a kid needs to reach a certain score on it. The school has a wide variety of classes on sports like sports history and sports broadcasting, so Maxton really wanted to get in because he wants a career in sports. \n\nA few months ago, the parents of the kids asked me to tutor them, at first I agreed to tutor both. A few weeks into the school year, Kinsleigh had got herself in pretty severe trouble after her and her friends got caught sending homophobic DMs to other students, including calling a male student with a boyfriend the f slur. Maxton was one of the boys who exposed the girls for doing this.\n\nAfter this incident, she wouldn\u2019t apologize and was being rude to me and others, so I told her parents that I would not be tutoring her anymore, there was some pushback from them but nothing too much.\n\nA few days ago, right before Thanksgiving, the kids took the test. Maxton\u2019s score was high enough to get into the school, Kinsleigh did not. \n\nI got a text from the mother after the results came back, she told me what happened and said she wanted to speak with me when they got home. I talked to them and she accused me of trying to \u201ctear the kids relationship apart\u201d and said I was encouraging Maxton to \u201cbe a snitch\u201d by \u201crewarding him for tattling\u201d, Maxton will still be going to the school next year and is very excited.

Her mom blames Maxton for Kinsleigh's issues rather than addressing her actual misdeeds and follow-on behavior.    It's probably a good thing that they will be going to different schools so he can get some relief from being associated with his sister.   I would be very concerned about the way he is treated within the family if she's berating him for being a stand-up kid.", "NTA. This family sounds awful. Homophobia is a massive red line and it sounds like her mother is condoning it. You should be able to tutor whoever you like and you can choose to or not to for any reason. I don't think you should, unless you desparately need money", "Need more infor? I'm going with NTA, though.\n\nDid they pay you to tutor their children, or did you do so without compensation? I think that's key here? Its a sad fact of life that educators sometimes have to deal with kids who aren't very appealing in their personality quirks and flaws. Regardless of their lack of polish at school, you have to treat them equally and share your talents with them equally. In your private life, putting up with an ill behaved kid is something you get to decide for yourself whether or not you want to be bothered. \n\nSo, if they paid you and you kicked Kinsleigh to the curb - then that's not OK, IMO. But, if people asked you to put up with their not nice kid out of the goodness of your heart - then you get to ignore the kid who behaves like a jerk.\n\nPersonally, I would have stopped tutoring both of them because oftentimes when kids screw up and are offensive and disrespectful, I figure they need more of their parents' attentions and less of mine, after school hours.\n\nBut, Kinsleigh not being prepared is her parents' problem. Lots of us have hired tutors for our kids. Tutoring costs money so we as parents expect our kids to focus and invest in their performance. \"You have to focus and work hard toward this goal, or you won't qualify for the high school programs you want or be with your friends if they get into a better school.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Part of being a private tutor is teaching the children a variety of subjects and one of them should be what is right and wrong within polite society as anyone wealthy enough to pay someone to parent for them sure as heck won't be bothered to teach their children that themselves. If the parent has a problem with the person they pay giving their children moral lessons they can stop paying but if you are paid to educate a child morality should be something you educate them on.", "Lol I also thought that this could have been related to that AITA thread as well since several points are so similar/line up.", "Teacher here!

The son, Maxton, worked, studied and passed the test. On the other hand, Kinsleigh made the decision to bully another student and she got caught and punished for her actions. She was rude to OP and her coworkers, refused to apologize to her bullying victim and OP opted not to tutor her anymore. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. \n\nPrivate tutoring takes time. Depending on how often she tutored the teens each week, it could\u2019ve taken away from the time she needed for her own work; grading papers, lesson plans etc.  She is well with her rights not to put up with the poor behavior of a teenager with an attitude problem.
