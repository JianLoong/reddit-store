Thank you for suggestion", "Hard to tell, divorce hit her hard and she visits various doctors,but that part of personality seems the same now as it was when I was a kid. I never called her names tho, so it was a shock to see her crying in a passenger seat.", "NTA. look, she\u2019s allowed to have a rough time and accept some grace, sure. she\u2019s allowed to not always be at her best/kindest as she works through this transition, sure. however, she is being outwardly rude to you, and then circling back and playing the victim when you won\u2019t just be a punching bag when she needs it. does she have a history of doing this? i can understand her feeling guilt for not having money, but this was a very immature and unreasonable response on her end. it sounds like she is self-sabotaging and driving a wedge in your relationship. truly, it sounds like she needs help and some counseling to help her work through this time in her life. personally i would limit (not cut off entirely) contact with her until she seeks some professional help and learns to take some accountability. if you don\u2019t nip this in the bud, i fear it will only get worse, she will continue to push you, and you may find yourself saying worse to her than \u201cyou\u2019re being an AH right now,\u201d leading you to feel even worse for standing up for yourself", "Because she is manipulative. Stop going to places with her and stop buying things for her. Don't go to this store with her.", "Okay so you do mind buying her some stuff-  which is fair.

Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "She's crying because you're not supposed to fight back when she takes advantage of you. You're supposed to allow her to manipulate you as she pleases and not ever complain that she's apparently generally not paying back what she promised.\n\nYou MAY be - mistakenly - thinking she is crying because you hurt her feelings. Nope. Crying is 100% *also* her manipulating you into feeling so guilty for standing up for yourself that you'll back down. \n\nI mean, I guess you hurt her feelings if by that you mean \"you upset her by justifiably calling her out,\" but her response is still absolutely a manipulation attempt.", "i think OP means that they have no problem buying her gifts that are at OPs discretion to provide. Like, if my best friend asked me to buy them a week of groceries even, sure not a problem. happy to help.\n\nhowever, if that same friend didn\u2019t ask beforehand, and just lumped their groceries in with mine at checkout and said \u201ci\u2019ll pay you back\u201d and then took a chunk of change off of what they owed me? AND never paid me back? suddenly it comes across that they feel entitled to my money, which is incredibly rude. i would feel compelled to start nickel and dime-ing them as well", "Thank you, it's refreshing to hear that mom are not exempt from being assholes. This threat actually helped me a lot with getting out of a shock, I didn't expect that.", "Yeah I would too! I totally agree with OP I mean who would expect someone to pay for them all the time without prior consent? It\u2019s odd", "Mom is a person just like anyone else and we all have the capability to be mean and nasty and like an asshole. They are parents not gods and no one is perfect. My mom has been an asshole on and off my whole life. It\u2019s why we are very low contact. I\u2019m seeing her tomorrow for the first time in 2 years"]}
