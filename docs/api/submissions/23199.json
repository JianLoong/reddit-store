Reminds me of an incident in high-school. Was minding my own business when some woman came up to me and asked which class her son was in. I'd never even met him before.

I checked mine casually when my brother acquired his and realized I had like eight days before I would have had to apply for a new one from scratch.

Advice?", "I wouldn\u2019t have the slightest clue where to find this information. I know my mom\u2019s DOB, and a few guesses on what state she was born in but definitely not the city. I know my dad\u2019s birth year, but I\u2019ve been estranged from him for 20 years and wouldn\u2019t have anyone I could ask for information on him.

When I see them we usually go out to lunch, not hang out in their house. \n\nIs there a practical reason that I should have this information? Just wondering how important it is for me to have an uncomfortable conversation with my mom. \ud83d\ude2c", "That's a tough situation. I know my brother and I would have gone to live with an aunt and uncle, or with his godparents. But that doesn't seem like an option here. My husband and I are about to start trying to have kids, so it's a conversation we've had a lot. Especially since my parents are older and my brother is suuper religious, to the point where, while I grew up going to church, I'd not want my kids going to live with him. We've decided to designate several potential guardians, depending on their ability to take in kids. 0\n\nFirst choice is my cousin and her husband, second is my husbands friend and his wife, etc. We have the added complication that my husbands family is all in Turkey, so we are planning to raise our kids to be bilingual, since otherwise they won't be able to talk to their paternal grandparents. So if they go to my cousin and her husband, we're going to request that they have several video calls a week with their dad's side of the family and spend summers in Turkey with their paternal grandparents. If they go with my husbands friend and his wife, the language wouldn't be an issue because they're Turkish themselves. But it adds complexity to the situation, you know? \n\nWith kids that far apart in age, you *could* have separate guardians, and request that they spend holidays/weekends together....But I personally wouldn't want to separate siblings like that following significant trauma like losing both their parents at once. A lot depends on your specific situation, I guess. I have college friends who would take in my future kids in a heartbeat, if they needed a home. Even if we haven't spoken in months because life gets crazy. My suggestion would be to go with whoever you think will give them the best care if the worst is to happen. Who could you trust to make sure they are able to see a therapist consistently to deal with the trauma of losing you both? Who would love them unconditionally if they end up identifying as LGBTQ+? Who do you think would make the time to go to the school plays/sports games/other extracurriculars? \n\nAlso, if you have sentimental items you want them to have, something my mom always recommends is to write down what they are and why. My Grandpa left my mom a cavalry sword from an uncle of his, but she only heard the story once and doesn't remember anything besides that it belonged to an uncle of her dad's, not even the uncle's name. So, she always suggests writing a letter with all that kind of information, so the history of a particular family heirloom can be preserved."]}
