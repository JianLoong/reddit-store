Like, really weird.", "NTA. She's just mad she didn't listen to you and apply before her passport expired. Now she's trying to shift the blame on you even though her reasoning makes no sense whatsoever.", "Nta. It sounds like your wife was unprepared and stressed out. Just for the record my husband and I have been together for 16/17 years. I don\u2019t know his parents birthdates. Heck I have my parents\u2019 birthdates written down but I couldn\u2019t tell you when they were born or where they were born off the top of my head lol. This is information we all need to be prepared to have. Your wife should have looked it up ahead of time.", "NTA\n\nThat's ridiculous. Hope ate you supposed to know if she doesn't?", "You're absolutely NTA.  You even asked her to fill out the application form which would have asked those questions and at that point she could presumably have asked her mother the answers, but she chose not to do it that way.  There's no way you can be responsible for this.  She probably just got mad at you because she was panicking.", "NTA, unless you're also her brother, lol", "Aren't US passports valid for 10 years, not 15?\n\nShe's a big girl, it's her responsibility to renew her passport before the old one expires.", "NTA  she is just being passive aggressive and blaming the result on you. She decided she didn't think the information was important so she didn't bother.  Does she do this kind of thing often?", "Im.....confused.  How would you know?", "NTA. It's her parents information. The burden falls on her to remember the info or find a way of obtaining it. It's weird that she expects you to know that information.", "NTA. The government doesn't need to know? You don't either. Seriously why do you need to have memorized how old your in laws are?", "NTA. Her parents. Some of the info may be on her birth certificate if she has that but it's up to her to gather the info", "NTA, my spouse and I don't know that stuff about each other's parents either. Even if we had discussed it at some point, there's no way I would have it committed to memory.", "**NTA** \\- Your wife is using anger to deflect from her own lack of preparation.  Some people are like that.", "NTA She's planting a big ole marinara flag though", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Reminds me of an incident in high-school. Was minding my own business when some woman came up to me and asked which class her son was in. I'd never even met him before.
