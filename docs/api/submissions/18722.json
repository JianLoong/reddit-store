{"id": 18722, "submission_id": "13xmnbu", "title": "AITA for eating at work without telling my husband?", "selftext": "Me and my husband (31F&32M) are different in the sense that he grew up in a more traditional home in the sense that dinners were family meals, every day. Me on the other hand, I grew up in a home where everyone just ate when they happened to get home, because there was always something in the fridge. Sometimes we\u2019d eat together, sometimes not.\n\nDuring our relationship, I adopted my husbands style of eating because it was good for spending time together and having a nice routine. That being said I would still occasionally eat somewhere if I happened to be hungry and not wait to get home to eat together. I work away from home whereas my husband is home all the time. He never returned to office since covid and just works from home. \n\nSo to the actual incident. Today I had a longer day at work and just decided to eat there before going home. When I got back, my husband seemed mildly upset, saying that it\u2019s the one thing he looks forward to in his day and I need to communicate if I\u2019m doing that, because he had been waiting for me all hungry and it\u2019s our eoutine. To be honest I was a bit defensive and told him it\u2019s not really a big deal because he was, in my opinion, acting increasingly mad and I thought it was overkill. He wanted me to apologize, but I didn\u2019t do it right away, because it wouldn\u2019t have been genuine. I can\u2019t apologize if it feel like it\u2019s being demanded. That triggered him more until he had a mini explosion of frustration and yelled about all the stuff mentioned above and said my pride is preventing me from apologizing. I just startend crying and left. Now I\u2019m cooling off and writing this. \n\nTo be honest, I think he TOTLLY overreacted and I think this speaks of a bigger issue in him if a missed dinner is this bad. Matbe he\u2019s depressed, anxious, unhappy about some other stuff too? Idk but it\u2019s how I\u2019m feeling now. So I just want to know, AITA for this?\n\nTldr: Husband is pissed cause I ate at work and didn\u2019t apologize\n\nEDIT: Just to make a few things clearer. He knew I was working later today, that part wasn\u2019t a surprise. Also I agree that I should have communicated it, that part is totally my fault. I guess the reason I was defensive and non apologetic at first is because while I know he was mildly upset at first, I could tell it was not his usual type of annoyance. It was much more short, demanding and harsh feeling. It has occasionally happened in the past where our miscommunication leads to this type of argument. And if he does have that explosion, he is for a short while very unempathetic and rude, not caring if I cry. It\u2019ll only annoy him more because he feels like he\u2019s the one that\u2019s been wronged. Anyways, if I feel like he\u2019s acting even slightly in that way, I\u2019m much less able to accept my wrong doings and become sensetive and defensive. Which is how I felt today. And that\u2019s just a recipe for disaster I guess. Not trying to say that this stuff makes me right, I\u2019m just explaining my thoughts out loud", "created_utc": 1685638024, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xmnbu/aita_for_eating_at_work_without_telling_my_husband/", "score": 634, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a routine together, if you're going to deviate from it in a way that impacts the other person, it's only polite to give them a heads-up. \n\nYou were rude, you refused to apologize, then you turned it around and made it his fault for being upset and started crying. Not to be an armchair psychiatrist, but that sounds like some DARVO bullshit to me.", "Having read a few of your comments I have to say YTA here.\n\nNot for eating at work, but absolutely for not telling your husband.\n\nYou have said that he was waiting for your to get home so you could eat together - so you made him wait for no reason. If this is what you usually do, just drop him a message saying you had food. \n\nIf that was it, I'd judge N A H but you then doubled down and turned his mild upset into genuine upset by totally dismissing his feelings on the matter. This is a situation where an apology represents a recognition that you could have behaved differently - so I guess you were right to not apologise as you clearly didn't recognise there way any way you could be wrong.\n\nFinally, YTA for assuming that he might be depressed or anxious when in reality he is just upset because you didn't seem to give a shit about how he feels.", "You're not listening. He's mad because you didn't communicate that you were doing something differently than your usual routine. He waited for you and wouldn't have had he known you were just gonna eat at work that day. \n\nYTA", "YTA  \n\n\nYou should have communicated to him that you were going to eat at work since you were staying late; it's common courtesy.    \n\n\nIt's not a missed dinner, its poor communication on your part.  You are 100% the asshole here.", "YTA. You know he values that time together. Text him when plans get disrupted. It's really so simple.", "Bruh YTA. His request that you communicate your dinner plans when they change are entirely reasonable. Not sure why you got all defensive about that and brought out the waterworks. \n\nThis is more revealing about your characteristics than anything about him.", "Girl YTA big time. Based on your comments, why did you even marry someone you don't like?", "Feels like there is a much bigger issue here regarding how you and your husband communicate. This was your signal that you two need help learning how to better communicate. He has asked for this from you and you don't think it's valid. This goes WAY beyond a simple meal. You need to figure out what you ACTUALLY want from this: do you want to be RIGHT or do you want to be in a HAPPY relationship? Because while you can have both, right now, you aren't in a happy relationship.\n\nYTA", "I am leaning YTA, mainly as it appears that you simply \"decide\" to eat elsewhere -- on random days -- without giving your husband a heads up that you are doing so. \n\nHe has every right to be unhappy, and when you get all defensive and disregard his feelings, it is understandable that he would become more upset. \n\nI get the working late thing; my H and I both occasionally worked long days. So when you \"decide\" that you are not going to eat at home, how about giving your H a quick text or call, \"Hey I need to stay at work longer than usual to finish this project, please don't hold up dinner for me.\"", "YTA\n\nIf your routine is that you get home and eat together, it was rude not to update him that your plans had changed. He waited for you just to find you\u2019d already eaten - being \u201cmildly upset\u201d as you describe it is an appropriate reaction and you should have apologized. Not that big a deal. \n\nThe rest seemed more to do with your refusal to apologize making him feel more upset and frustrated. Totally understandable.", "YTA\n\nNot for eating at work, but for not communicating.  When you decided to eat at work, you tell your husband you are hungry and going to eat now, so he should go ahead and eat without you. You have a routine, so if you vary that routine you tell the person.  \n\nIt doesn't seem like the missed meal is the issue.  The lack of communication is.", "YTA. He\u2019s not pissed that you ate at work\u2026he\u2019s pissed because you didn\u2019t bother to tell him not to wait for you. If your default as a couple is to wait for the other to eat and eat together, it\u2019s common courtesy to let the other person know you\u2019re changing plans. It\u2019s really not hard to do, or hard to apologize when you don\u2019t do it.", "YTA- I wonder if you actually missed his point.  He wants you to let him know if you do this, so HE isnt waiting around for you to come home to eat too.  If its a routine you always do, then you suddenly decide to do something else, how is he meant to know? A simple text while you are eating could have fixed this issue.  Say sorry, you told him his feelings were not a big deal. Thats totally not cool.", "YTA. Your gaslighting him and us. He isn't pissed cause you ate at work, he is pissed because you didn't communicate you weren't waiting to eat at home even though eating together has become the standard. All he wanted was communication. This entire incident could've been solved via a text.", "Info: did he make a meal expecting you to eat it? Did he not eat waiting for you?", "YTA. This is your routine so you are aware he would be waiting for you to get home so you can eat together. If you'd have just text him that you were going to eat at work and that he should eat without you on that day there is nothing wrong with that but you left him waiting without an explanation. You should have apologized and done the right thing", "A text would have avoided this whole situation. \u201cGonna be late. Thanks for for cooking.

Lemme know early enough so I don\u2019t get started. You were being AH adjacent. You\u2019re actions weren\u2019t aweful, but your attitude stunk.", "Do I have this right?\n\nHe made you dinner and was waiting for you.  You knew this and ate a full dinner at work without even telling him until you got home?\n\nWell yeah, you're YTA.  Have you never heard of a granola bar?", "YTA. I think he isn't pissed because you ate at work - he is pissed because you didn't communicate that you were eating at work. He was waiting for you to eat.", "YTA - you have a routine of eating together and you should have let him know you were working late and not to wait for dinner. It\u2019s totally inconsiderate on your part and somehow you\u2019ve also managed to turn around the whole situation in your head to make him look like an arsehole.", "Your husband isnt mad you ate at work, He's mad that you didn't communicate that. Your response was to tell him he's overreacting? Really??\n\nWhen plans are changed, even if he knew you were working late you need to COMMUNICATE. A single text would have taken you a couple seconds instead he was at home waiting for you because he thought you were coming home.\n\nYTA", "YTA. He might have over reacted and maybe there's more to it, but is it so hard to text him and say you're eating somewhere else? Especially knowing that it means a lot to him. Also if you apologized to him from the start, he probably wouldn't have exploded like he did.\n\nEither way, communication is key in every relationship, you lacked communication to your partner and refused to apologise for it, therefore YTA.", "YTA, he said exactly what the problem was, that you did not communicate with him, so he waited for you for nothing. Then you escalated for no reason. YTA and next time just let him know so he can eat too.", "YTA. you didn\u2019t do anything wrong by eating alone. But you\u2019re aware your husband grew up with dinners being a lot more important than they are to you and even adopted the routine. All he was asking for at first was more communication, for you to let him know if he needs to wait up on you for dinner. You know he\u2019s expecting to eat dinner together so i think that\u2019s a totally fair request. It\u2019s about more than this incident, he told you straight up it\u2019s the one thing he looks forward to in the day. Eating dinner together is obviously really important to him, and it was probably more your immediate dismissal of those feelings that made him upset. You just told him he was overreacting lmao. There\u2019s no communication or care in that response.", "YTA a bit, the lack of communication is the big problem, but maybe he just wants someone to talk to if he has spent the whole day at home by himself. You don't have to eat with him, but keeping him company while he eats might solve some of these problems.", "YTA for not telling him that you would be eating/had eaten at the office. That\u2019s just flat-out rude when the expectation that YOU helped create is that you would eat together.", "YTA-- he's not pissed just because you ate at work and forgot to tell him.\n\nYou knew you were wrong but refused to acknowledge it or apologize, were dismissive of his feelings that you both know about and share given you said you like the routine too, and then when he broke you started crying to deflect a conversation about his feelings and your wrong doing into one about your feelings.\n\nYou say he has a pattern of this where he gets unempathetic... But it sounds like you have a pattern of being unempathetic when you've done something wrong, being stubborn and not apologizing because you assume he'll blow up if you're stubborn and egg him on, and then use that eventual meltdown point that you intentionally pushed him towards as evidence after the fact that you were right to be shitty\n\nTry taking a step away from the conversation to process when you're told you fucked up and use that space to cool down and think about your husband's experience and feelings before doing whatever the fuck all this is", "YTA.\n\nYou admitted it right in your op: \"I should have communicated it\". Also, your wholesale casual dismissal of your spouse's priorities and feelings is a GIANT waving red flag. It is not okay.", "YTA. Why wouldn\u2019t you have messaged him saying not to wait for you to eat. You were so hungry you couldn\u2019t wait, why are you having issues seeing he was also hungry but unlike you didn\u2019t eat. Because he was waiting. You say you think there was something other than you eating going on and there was. He was hungry.", "YTA he waited for you and was hungry, for no reason. Purely because you weren\u2019t considerate enough to let him know.", "Soft YTA for the lack of communication and downplaying his comment. You could\u2019ve said that you were stopping to eat on the way back from work and asked him if he wanted something to go. He values your daily dinners because it\u2019s quality time after work.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with getting food after work. You just could\u2019ve communicated the routine change better since he places more value on the family dinners than you.", "YTA. Yet another AITA that could have never happened if there had been a very short conversation.\n\nAnd yes, you should say sorry, you should have called.", "YTA you need to communicate better with him. I also am traditional with my family and having dinner together is quality time and you can find out things about your husband and children and how their day went and uncover if they\u2019re having problems. But I also think if he\u2019s having explosive behavior towards you because of your miscommunication, he needs to learn how to handle that.", "YTA, you keep saying in your comments you\u2019re not communicating your side properly but I\u2019m not sure what your side would be to make you NTA. You blame him for being mildly upset and then getting more pissed off but you immediately got defensive instead of just saying \u201cmy bad i fucked up\u201d . You also keep saying it\u2019s not important to you which isn\u2019t the point at all, which you already know so not sure why you posted this. You seem super dismissive of your husband too, like I get not everything important to one of you is going to be important to the other but this is something he finds important and takes you literally 0 effort and all you keep doing is basically shit talking it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's just rude.\n\n*But taking your description at face value.*.. your husband seems like he has temper issues? Not entirely sure how to read it again, this is taking at face value what is inherantly unreliable narration, but yelling in anger to the point of bringing someone to tears is *a lot*, even if it does sound like he has *a point* that you are too proud to apologize. \n\nYou *should* apologize, but you *both* need to work on your communication. Or put another way, you started this with causing a legitimate grievance, but that doesn't mean he handled himself the best (*and if a one time thing, he is very minor TA here just letting his frustrations get away from him. If it is always how he acts when you do something wrong... that is a much bigger issue than missing dinner as it is abuse).*", "NTA  not exactly an asshole but hear me out .\n\nYou chose this man .

And your behaviour (for him was like a fuck you I don't care )( im not saying you said that i am saying what it means to him) if he comes from a traditional background it means he only shows his weaknesses to you.\n\nRemember marriage is not about being right or wrong its about how can we make it better, how can we build something stronger. Marriage is not 0 and 1 its both of you dancing between these 2 to reach and a tougher conclusion.\n\nBasically with your behaviour you are saying to him I do not care and nighter should you.\n\nIn moments like this don't jump straight into defence mode try to understand how he is feeling.

He might not be able to communicate in a better way and can have outbursts but you just crying isn\u2019t going to make it better.\n\nEdit spelling\nEdit 2 my opinion after seeing OPs comments", "YTA because he and you are right that more communication is needed. He acted badly, we all do it, it\u2019s worth moving on.", "The reason I disn\u2019t give the heads up is that even to this day, tohether dinners are not that important to me. For me it\u2019s the evening time of cuddling and watching tv etc. So yeah I guess my actions stem from that and I was being self centered and thoughtless about it. So it was in some weird way shocking to me, how increasingly angry it made him because at that point it was still a non issue to me", "It must have been frustrating for the husband. He was explaining to OP what was bothering him and causing him to be \"mildly upset\" (as she called it), but she refused to acknowledge that she had done anything wrong and told him it wasn't a big deal.", "I'd be pissed too if I was waiting for someone to eat and getting hungrier and hungrier and they came home and said \"oh, I already ate.\" especially since I'd be acting from a place of hunger :). A text would have taken 60 seconds to write and saved him several hours of being hungry.", "Absolutely, yta. I taught my kids to apologize if they hurt their siblings, and they'd say, \"I didn't mean to hurt them\" ALL the more reason to say sorry.", "Yes that\u2019s actually something I should have mentioned. I agree that I should have communicated better. Maybe the better framing would have been if I\u2019m in the wrong for not immidiately apoligizing when my husband became (in my opinion) unreasonably andgry and demanding. I feel like if he had just been calmer and less pissy about it, I would have agreed right away and told him sorry", "Yes this is true, my post is framed wrong in hind sight. I\u2019m more curious about whether or not his reaction was warranted and if my mistake was really that meaningful", "Look at the way OP is fighting with everyone in the comments. She is TA here and honestly seems like a shit person all around. Can't comprehend anything existing or having meaning outside of them", "I agree. Edited for clarity, the lack of communication about eating at work is a light YTA but that middle part about not apologizing is grade school type nonsense. OP needs to just suck it up, apologize, and shoot a text the next they are eating at work.", "You assume I don\u2019t like him because the dinner thing is less important to me than him? What makes you think that I have no things that are important to me to do together?", "You\u2019re right. I do it rarely, but if I do, it tends to just come to me and I\u2019m not really thinking about it much. I tend to think he isn\u2019t waiting for me and that the fridge is always full of food so if he\u2019s hungry, he\u2019ll have a snack. And if I have eaten, I can just tell him when I get home and he can eat without me, since it wouldn\u2019t have delayed anything anyways. I just wouldn\u2019t be joining him. He knew in advance that I\u2019d be late, so he was upset about not having company and me not letting him know so he could eat earlier alone and not wait for us to do it together. \n\nNow that I write that to myself I see how selfish it really was. I\u2019ll have to adjust my attitude", "Gaslighting is not the correct term and I hope you know that, seriously. And it says it right on the title, \u201dAITA for eating at work WITHOUT TELLING MY HUSBAND\u201d After which I proceed to explain how it is our norm. How on earth is that gaslighting? If I were trying to do that, I wouldn\u2019t have shared the details that make my husbands feelings more understandable", "No he was waiting to eat together the food we had ready in the fridge. That\u2019s how it usually is", "Well to be fair it was food i cooked yesterday that was in the fridge. He was simply waiting so we could reheat it.", "No that\u2019s not right. I made dinner yesterday. We were gonna reheat it today. I told him I\u2019d be a bit late and before I left decided to eat. I didn\u2019t mention it and thought he could just reheat the food on his own when I get home (very short commute, 15 minutes). I got home and told him I\u2019d eaten. He was upset cause if I had told him I was doing that he would have eaten earlier. I found his anger to be unreasonable in the moment and that upset him so much he had the explosion", "This is an important point. Because I feel like it's the act of sitting down together that's really important here. Sitting down to dinner is probably seen by the husband as a time to check in and connect. It's probably got very little to do with the eating itself.\n\nThat also would certainly explain why OP feels he was so upset. He just wanted to spend time with his wife and connect and she brushed him off and invalidated his feelings.\n\nBig time YTA to OP for that.", "It\u2019s not that my perspective would make me NTA! It\u2019s just that I keep explaining my thoughts baldy and people understand some of it wrong because of that. But I\u2019m not trying to say that it would change the verdict! I just have a need to clear stuff up I guess. And I don\u2019t mean to shit talk it because it is important to me too. I\u2019m just a lot more flexible about how often I need it. I\u2019m trying to give my honest thoughts", "Well this is a tough one. He does not act like this usually (6 years together). Plenty of disagreements have been had with one of both of us having been the wrong doer and it doesn\u2019t lead to any sort of explosions. However, very occasionally he\u2019ll have these \u201dtantrums\u201d of shouting and they pretty much always stem from a similar feeling. He says it happens when he feels like he\u2019s talking to a brick wall that refuses to hear him and just argues his feelings. I agree that I shouldn\u2019t do that, but from my perspective, that reaction from me only happens when I can sense that he is on edge about something in a way that does not feel like a productive way of arguing. Like his upsetness is not the usual kind. It\u2019s somehow demanding or harsh", "He was putting off meeting his own basic human need because he was waiting for her. She knew he would be waiting to eat with her and didn't bother to consider him enough to send a text. We're also only hearing her side of the argument. It sounds to me like she was acting pretty angry too", "Yes I agree and I\u2019m super confused. That\u2019s why I added the bit where I\u2019m wondering if this is about something else", "This is what I\u2019m starting to think is the most accurate. While I was in the wrong, his explosion was really not appropriate and far too aggressive. That\u2019s not to diminish my own part. Just saying both were wrong, even rhough I was wrong first", "Well left the room, not the house. Should have clarified that", "I think that the main problem is that OP didn't tell her husband that she was going to eat outside, so she was waiting. In my house we have the same method as OP (eating whenever you can) but I would be upset if I am waiting for someone and they don't tell me that they eat outside.", "They normally eat together. One day she decides she's not going to eat with her husband and doesn't give him a warning so he can eat and not wait around for her. How is she not an asshole for not apologizing?", "Or maybe she gives him a quick update that she's eating at work, so he's not sitting at home hungry waiting for his wife to have dinner with him.", "You keep repeating how unimportant this thing is to you. Please communicate to your husband that he is now free to completely dismiss anything you believe is important that he does not. If that's the way you want your marriage to be, tell him so he can adjust his behavior accordingly.", "I mean, it's not about the togetherness, it's about him sitting around getting hangry when he would have just eaten if he'd known not to wait for you. That's the issue. You don't have to prioritize family dinner time, you DO have to consider how your decisions impact him.", "You really only think of yourself. You know this is important to him and blatantly don\u2019t care. How would you feel if he ate dinner then peace\u2019s out to a bar without telling you? Leaving you alone on the couch to watch a movie alone. You\u2019re very self centered.", "That\u2019s the problem at hand \u201cit\u2019s not an issue to me\u201d clearly it\u2019s an issue to him and as husband and wife you guys are to make those small gestures to one another to keep the marriage alive", "Then proceeded to throw a fit and cry in an attempt to make him the AH for upsetting her and making her cry when she was the guilty party.

You trivialized him, from start to finish here. The apology should have been the first thing out of your mouth when you walked through the door.", "You literally described him as \u2018mildly upset\u2019 before you got defensive and refused to apologize. He\u2019s really not allowed to be mildly upset when he\u2019s been sitting around hungry waiting to eat dinner with you and you didn\u2019t bother to tell him?

Because it sounds like sullen teenage behavior to withhold an apology just because they other person is upset.", "Oh so you are emotionally abusive on top of inconsiderate and selfish. Lovely", ">when my husband became (in my opinion) unreasonably andgry and demanding.\n\nNothing he did was unreasonable. You messed up, then tried to play it off like it was no big deal instead of genuinely apologizing immediately.

That poor man deserves better.", "It sounds like you\u2019ve been \u201cquiet quitting\u201d this tradition. Instead of telling him you can\u2019t commit to it anymore you\u2019re being increasingly disrespectful of the commitment you made and are responding defensively when called out for your pattern of bad behavior.", "It was meaningful to him. Obviously not so much to you. \n\nYou have to figure out how to respect the importance this has to him.  That doesn\u2019t have to mean you adopt his family culture, just that you understand it and respect that this is important to him.\n\nYou could meet his need for togetherness even if you do t eat by sitting down with him and a mug of tea while he eats. He could tell him \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to sitting down with you all day!\u201d", "His reaction is 100% warranted. Your mistake was very hurtful. You knew dinner time was important to him. When he voiced his feelings being hurt, you basically told him he was being a baby and to get over it. That's not fair. That's not love. You're dismissing his feelings completely and defending yourself instead of admitting TO HIM that you're wrong. \n\nHe probably feels unappreciated and thinks you don't even care that you hurt him", "Yes, his reaction was warranted. As you put it yourself, he was \"mildly upset\" by you not communicating and felt he deserved an apology. That is a perfectly acceptable reaction to your very inconsiderate action.\n\nYour mistakes are really that meaningful. Not one. Multiple. \n\nThe first was your lack of consideration revolving around dinner plans. You should have given him a heads up. Simple.\n\nThen you denied his feelings and your wrong doing. Shrugging it off as not a big deal despite knowing that it his to him. Refused to apologize despite clearly having done something wrong. \n\nThen you attacked him saying it wasn't a big deal and he was unreasonably angry about the situation. Obviously he is going to become frustrated as you refuse to apologize for doing something so shitty. Doubling down on not caring about his feelings because like he said you were too prideful or incinsiderate to admit you very clearly made a mistake. This will obviously be increasingly frustrating to someone who has been wronged and is now being denied an apology. \n\nFinally you made yourself the victim and him the offender. It's not my fault I didn't apologize, I didn't do it because he was upset. He shouldn't have been so upset with me! He has hurt me and made me cry.\n\nThis is DARVO. It is emotional manipulation. Whether you are conscience of what you did or not you are the bad guy here from start to finish. Apologize. Try to be better. Rather than immediately getting defensive when you hurt somebody, try empathy first. Someone being upset with your actions doesn't mean you shouldn't apologize. \n\nAnyway, I hope you can reflect on this behavior and the two of you can move forward. Good luck!", "He was telling you exactly how meaningful your mistake was to him, what makes you think a group of strangers are going to know his feelings better than him? His reaction and feelings were both warranted according to him, and as his partner, that must be enough for you to accept.\n\nMy partner has issues being abrasive when things deviate from routine. You\u2019re right on one count- feeling upset and agitated is not an excuse to be unkind, harsh, or rude.

I know that I get very upset when I'm hungry and have been waiting to eat, but to be told that \"its not a big deal\" when I try to express my disappointment is a whole other level of disrespect", "Dude was hangry", "I'm going to say ESH, because you guys both failed at communicating and it led to this entire conflict. Firstly, it was self-centered of you to not inform him that you were eating at work, especially because it's clearly so important to him. Not only that, but you threw off his daily schedule in the process.\n\nSecondly, when you came home, he was hungry. In fact, it sounds like he was hangry. He may have been shorter with you because when you're sitting around really hungry for a while for your wife to come home and eat with you, your temper becomes shorter and shorter, and will naturally come to a boiling point if she comes home having fed herself without having informed you, even though this was a long-standing plan literally every day.\n\nHowever, when he saw he wasn't getting anywhere with you, he should have stopped and you both should have taken some time to cool off. Some of the best relationship advice I've gotten is to not address any issues while either one of you is hungry, and to stop and eat if you are getting short with one another (which often fixes the problem, and has been instrumental in my marriage). While I completely understand why he lost his temper, I think he should have reeled himself in and not yelled at you (as yelling should really be avoided in relationships and is not cool unless under extreme circumstances, which these weren't).\n\nI understand not being able to apologize in the moment because you feel like it's demanded, but I also agree with him that it's a matter of pride. You should be working on being more free with your apologies, and understanding when you wronged someone. You should be able to work through your feelings of defensiveness when you've done something wrong and should work on being able to apologize anyway.\n\nHowever, I also understand being backed into a corner and having to leave. It wasn't cool that he made you cry because he was yelling at you, and it wasn't cool that he wouldn't back down when you felt trapped.\n\nThis entire thing could have been avoided with better communication on both sides, which is why I'm saying ESH. I think it would be good if you guys invested in a couple of books that discuss communication in relationships, as it sounds like this was a small thing that did not need to turn into an argument, but did because of a lack of communication.\n\nIf this situation had happened between my husband and I, I would have texted him, \"Hi, I'm sorry, I'm going to be late at work so I'm going to eat here. Is that ok?\" If not, he would have said, \"I understand, but I would much rather eat with you. Is there a way we can still eat together/spend time together once you get home?\" and we would have worked something out.\n\nIf I had already eaten and came home and he was hungry, he would have gotten upset with me and we would have had a conversation about it. If things began to heat up, he'd probably say we should address things after he's eaten. If that didn't happen, I would have said, \"Listen, I don't feel like it's productive to discuss this right now. I'm feeling upset about all of this and would like some time to reflect and get back to you. I'm sorry about what happened,\" and then address it later when I've calmed down more.\n\nThere were so many ways in which both of you could have de-escalated this situation, and it didn't happen, which leads me to believe y'all need to work on better communication methods.
