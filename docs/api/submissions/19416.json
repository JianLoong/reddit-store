If they keep up with there conservative attitude, I would just visit them on holidays.", "NTA. They literally can't stop you. You're an adult and can pay for the trip yourself, so set it up and go. If you're still dependent on them for money and/or a place to live, then they can stop supporting you in those ways--that's up to them. But don't fight with them--just go on the trip.", "You're an adult, and you're not asking them for money... no reason for you to take their permission. NTA", "NTA. They need to realize you\u2019re an adult and you are ready to go experience the world on your own. My mom was a bit strict with my sibs and me too, but after I turned 18, when I mentioned trips I was planning, she would say \u201chave fun, take lots of pictures, and call me when you get there.\u201d Sounds like they don\u2019t want to accept that their daughter no longer needs them, which sucks, but that\u2019s life.", "Fuck your parents, you are literally 21 years old. They can deal, go, have fun on your trip that YOU paid for.", "How bizarre. When do you get to be an adult ?", "Eh? You're 22. Your parents don't get to be strict.  NTA", "They do pay for college but I pay for all of the groceries, gas, and entertainment for stuff.   They say I should just wait until after graduation to travel but I have 3 months off for summer anyways? So I thought a short trip in the country would be a good experience.", "they might not pay for my last year of college, or I might get disowned", "I'm so sorry OP. Your parents are using their financial support as a means of control. It is wrong. \n\nIt also sets you up to really appeal to abusive partners in the future. They've raised you to be controlled. \n\nSadly, your best bet is to skip this vacation in order to get your last year of college paid for as it sounds like you feel it is worth it to you.  (If you decide otherwise, get a loan.)\n\nThe good news is this means you have a year to plan and prepare. Do whatever you need to to ensure you will be financially independent upon graduation. Take the opportunities they cost you to socialize to make extra money. \n\nThen go LC or NC. \n\nIn the mean time,  if therapy is available at school, consider it.  Your parents have robbed you of opportunities to adult and make decisions for yourself so it's best to start learning asap.\n\nOnce you graduate, return to therapy as soon as you can as you will very likely need help dealing with your parents. They have been overly controlling your entire life so it is reasonable to expect that they will handle your independence poorly. Support will be so valuable to get through the transition. If they elect to disown you, that's ok. It is just another effort to control you which is unhealthy and just plain ugly behavior. In time you will see the loss is entirely theirs. \n\nI'm so sorry your parents have failed to do right by you. Look forward to gaining your independence and cutting out the toxicity.", "If I were you I would try to pay for the rest of college myself through work and scholarships, if possible, so my parents wouldn\u2019t have leverage over me any more in the future. Then once free of their leverage, do what you want.\n\nIf that\u2019s not possible / affordable, you have to take a gamble on their forgiveness or wait a couple of years, I\u2019m afraid. You can try negotiating, like maybe they\u2019ll let you go if you send them frequent video text updates or let them track your phone during the trip.", "Give up fighting then. You have no leverage so it'a losing fight. You will shortly graduate and then you can do what you want.", "NTA but... what do you mean you thought they'd \"let\" you go?  You've been a grown adult for 3 years.  Just go.  You don't need their permission.  There is literally nothing stopping you except yourself.", "Once you give someone a gift you lose control over it", "NTA You are 21 they can't stop you and hopefully will get over it. Go and have a blast.", "You're an adult. Sooner or later you'll have to stand up to them in order to have the life you want. Now is as good a time as any.\n\nNTA", "If you are afraid that they will cut you off if you go on this trip, then it is time to save aggressively. You are not wrong. Your parents are controlling and delusional. But you may have to skip the trip for now.\n\nGet your education. Get a job and stable housing after college( even with roommates if it is more affordable). And then go low contact with your parents. They won't stop trying to control you, so you have to cut them off when you are ready. \n\nI am not saying that you should never talk to them again. Just slow the relationship down until you are stable and thus able to stand up for yourself. Because they will nitpick over everything. And your life dosn't need to be bogged down by their negativity forever.", "NTA but make your decision wisely. If your parents are paying for just about anything else (tuition, housing, meals) make preparations to lose that support.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need your parents permission to go on vacation.

They don't *have* to infantalize themselves to get an education.  I'd argue it's better they didn't.

Remind them that you are a good and responsable person and get your relaxation time. When I was 19 I went on a month vacation alone to meet up with a friend. One of my parents wasnt supportive. In the end I came home refreshed and inspired. The parent who didnt like the idea saw how good it did me and till this day is proud of me for just going yolo and going anyways. Sometimes you need to make choices that are hard, but you make them for you. Some parents have a hard time letting go or in your case letting go control. Its your money, your life. That they where strickt might have helped in the past but now its time for you to be responsable for yourself.", "Why are you qsking for permission at 21 to go on a trip and pay for it with your money that you earned?

I mean.... are your parents against DeSantis and his cronies, or just don't want you wasting money yet?  Florida is a bit of a cesspool,  so if it's against giving tourism dollars to a worthless piece if shit governor, I can at least agree with that.  Could you guys go somewhere with culture or worthwhile and your parents would't care?", "I don\u2019t know if you are at all interested or not, but coolworks.com you can find seasonal jobs all over the country, and they provide housing, and it\u2019s a great way to travel, but also make $$$\ud83d\ude09 plus it\u2019s work so they can\u2019t fault you for that. I\u2019ve worked at the Grand Canyon, Zion, the Virgin Islands, Glacier, and Florida. I\u2019m currently in Alaska. -ETA context", "Op won't be old enough to get financial aid as an independent student. So she would have to pay the full price out of pocket. That's 20k-65k depending where she is going. \n\nThat's a ridiculous price to pay to prove you're your own perso ."]}
