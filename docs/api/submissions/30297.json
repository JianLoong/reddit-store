(I also pay for that)\n\nEveryone was extremely angry with me after that and I told my son I no longer support his marriage and I will take the wedding funds for his education but please don\u2019t marry Sammie. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t been talking to me saying he loves her and it was really awful of me to withdraw money from the weddings because Sammie and her mom put the downpayment of the dress on Sammie\u2019s mom credit card. \n\nAs of right now if I don\u2019t help with the wedding I\u2019m not invited if I do not help with paying it.

Your son, DIL, and her mother are all looking at this very differently than you. They are looking at the dream and fantasy of what she and her mother see as their wedding day.  \n\nNot sure why they want to get married so early in life. If they expect to be together for life then waiting and getting better situated, financially stable, and more mature walking into marriage would help provide a base for a more durable relationship. $10,000 for a dress is nice when you have the means to pay for that but in their situation they should not be looking to spend that kind of money on the wedding. \n\nQuestions:\nIn your offer to help pay for the wedding did you provide a set amount that you will contribute ?\n\nBefore canceling your financial support have you tried to explain to your son and future DIL that the intention was to provide a modest wedding within certain means and to help them avoid going into debt for the sake of the wedding day ? \n\nFor two people making minimum wage, and even with any help from the girl\u2019s mother - have they established a budget to work with ?\n\nDo they actually understand that you were not intending to pay for everything ?\n\nDo they understand that any balances that they can not pay for now will require them to go into debt to pay later ? \n\nWhy do they want to marry now?

You didn\u2019t qualify in the post any set amount for financial support you offered for the wedding, so it is not clear what expectations your son and DIL had in that regard.  Emotions run high with weddings, planning, and everything to do with it. \n\nIf I had any suggestion it would be to go back to your son and explain calmly that you want to support him and that you are concerned about how the two of them will manage not only for the wedding day but going forward also without a more practical approach to budget and spending. That you have $X to offer in support of their wedding and hoped that would be enough to help prevent them from going into debt. \n\nIf other plans have not been made I\u2019d suggest asking them to wait a bit longer maybe get an apartment together\u2026 and get married when on better footing. But that won\u2019t likely go over with them.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA but you need to define a budget. Also you can just say, I\u2019m giving you a lump sum of $x and you do what you want with it. \n\nBut looking at a $10k dress is outrageous.

Firstly, your concerns about financial responsibility are valid, especially given the expensive tastes she has shown, which do not align with her current financial situation. Your original intention to provide funds was to prevent your son from incurring debt, not to enable lavish spending on items like a $10,000 dress. This indicates a clear mismatch between your expectations of what constitutes a reasonable wedding cost and those of your future daughter-in-law and her mother.  \n\n\nMoreover, you are choosing to prioritize your son's education, which is a commendable decision as it is a long-term investment in his future, rather than a single day's celebration. This decision reflects a responsible approach to financial management and shows your commitment to your son's long-term well-being. It also appears there was a lack of clear communication from the outset regarding the budget and expectations for the wedding expenses, which has led to this unfortunate situation.\n\n  \nYou have every right to decide how to spend your money and to set financial boundaries, particularly if you feel that your initial offer is being taken advantage of. By supporting your son's efforts to further his education and avoid debt, you are demonstrating your values of financial prudence and self-improvement. While it's crucial to handle this delicate matter with sensitivity to maintain your relationship with your son and future daughter-in-law, it's equally important to have a calm and honest discussion with your son. This conversation should address your concerns and your willingness to support him in ways that are mutually agreed upon to be beneficial for his future.", "I *could* spend $10K on a dress, but never, ever would.

If not, YTA. Your child and his fiance are adults (even if it is just barely) and you originally left them to make decisions about their wedding budget on their own.

They may never forgive you for that.", "You offered to pay for the wedding but didnt give them a budget? Im confused as to what you thought would happen? Was it not nice to go for a 10K dress sure but you offered to pay with seemingly no limits making it seem like they could do whatever they wanted", "The trick to helping a child with wedding expenses is to tell the couple that you can contribute a specific amount. If they spend more, it\u2019s on them. If they spend less, they can keep the money for a house, honeymoon, whatever they want. A $10k dress is absolutely ridiculous for people of their means. You are NTA for not supporting this wedding but your reasons are not the big concerns I would have. She needs to get her GED and he needs to finish his education before they get married. Being married means being independent and not still needing your parents to support you. I absolutely would not pay for his schooling if he\u2019s married. If you are old enough to get married, you should be old enough to support yourselves. \n\nThey seem pretty immature to be getting married IMO.

If you found a simple white dress at Wal-Mart and stuck a Prada label and a $10,000 price tag on it she'd be all over it.", "Or a paid off older car!", "She is going to get knocked up as fast as possible and be a SAHM and put all the financial strain on the boy (and I mean BOY)  While she online shops all day.", "I spent 500 pen on my dress and I was so proud for having spent so little on the dress. I truly wanted to use a casual dress (I had some semi formal dresses that I wore to the office), but my mom guilt tripped me into a buying a dress that was \"wedding dress\", you know? It made her happy and it wasn't that expensive, so it turned out okay.", "Mine was 39.99 from a website. We had a destination wedding (before it became popular) and from soup to nuts, the whole thing was under 7k.", "NTA. She's from a broke family and they think you're rich bc you are middle class with savings for your son's education and wedding. She probably doesn't love him that much and she and her mom think she's landed a meal ticket.  If you stop paying for things she might even call off the wedding. If not, redirect the wedding money in to a savings fund to help your son pay for the divorce lawyer he's going to need in a few years. And keep paying for his education.", "I knew a couple who got married really young and they had the reception at a local restaurant, and I laughed at how lame and trashy it was. Then I got older and paid for a wedding, and now I think they\u2019re the smartest people in the world.\n\nNTA", "My mom fell in love with my dad when she was 17. They married before she turned 20. They remained married more than 40 years until his death. And even she says that no way teenagers need to marry or experience romantic cohabitation. \ud83d\ude18", "Give it to him in 2 years after the divorce. Too young and immature to get married.", "Definitely way to young, she is all about the wedding but probably hasn\u2019t thought about the marriage part", "i got married at 22 and split 24 so.. this ione", "This\n\nThey are too young to be getting married. She has no HS diploma while he is still in school. Ridiculous that they want to rush into marriage. They need to work on getting their life stabilized first before taking the next step.\n\nAnd if they want a basic cheap wedding then they can get a basic cheap dress to go with it.", "It's giving \"Sir, this is a Wendy's.\" It's amazing.", "I had a a fantastic small wedding at the beach in gulf shores in 2018. Had a beautiful ceremony on the beach and a small buffet reception (which was delish) at one of the local restaurants in the private room. I also bought everyone a personal gift, and we had a beach condo for a week. After everything it was probably $7k (and that included the condo for a week, the dress, makeup, hair, everything). It was a beautiful, fun, small family wedding of about 25-30 people. Why people have these insanely over the top expensive weddings is crazy to me.", "I had a decent sized wedding for under 2k and I feel like we even got to splurge a lot. I got my wedding dress from Amazon, but what else can you expect when you\u2019re in love and want to get married at 19 lol\u2026 I don\u2019t see where that young girls illusions are coming from", "Ugh my parents think all they do is \u2018plant seeds of thought\u2019 when it just pushes me away the same amount as actually coming out and saying they disapprove of a certain situation", "There won\u2019t be a divorce lawyer if there\u2019s no assets to divide anyway.", "I was wigging balls my $150 fb marketplace wedding dress ended up costing a lot more with alterations and a cleaning. Cannot imagine getting married in a $10K dress and I\u2019m financially stable lol", "I thought this too, but re-reading it, OP is paying for the wedding, and DIL is saying that since DIL doesn't have to pay for the wedding, DIL (and by extension, OPs son) can afford a 10k wedding dress.  It explains why OP mentioned DIL constantly buying clothes outside her means. It also explains this line that didn't make sense to me before. \"Her getting a 10k dress defeats my whole purpose of paying for the wedding because I didn\u2019t want my son to be in a boat load of debt.\"  If OP was supposed to pay for the dress, her son wouldn't be in debt.  The implication is that DIL (and OPs son) would be footing the bill for the dress. She also mentions specifically that the down payment was on DIL's moms credit card.", "Fair point. I assumed ..  can\u2019t say why.", "She talked stuff about her own son too, so its even. She isnt bad. 19!", "My wife and I did that (not Chilli's for dinner, but a local hotel restaurant that is decent, but not too expensive).  It was one of the best decision we made in our lives.  I wish I could say it allowed us to avoid the drama of a wedding though, there were lots of people who were angry we didn't have a normal wedding.", "They're 19... the princess is probably already pregnant, that's why there is such a rush?", "That\u2019s what my parents did. I was super lucky to have them offer to pay and they gave us an amount they were willing to give and we stayed within it. We had a great wedding too!", "Because of the dress shopping comment, maybe?", "It was the context clue of dress shopping; since OP was there with Sammie and her mom most readers assume OP is female because wedding dress shopping is traditionally a single-gendered activity. Not sure if you\u2019ve been to a dress fitting, but it\u2019s kind of invasive and you end up standing around in various states of undress and getting draped and arranged in floor model dresses that don\u2019t really fit and you definitely need help getting into and wouldn\u2019t fit in a private dressing room anyway. Point being, it\u2019s time consuming, semi-private, and men just don\u2019t go; any man who needs to know what the dress looks like, including one paying for it, gets text pictures.", "My uncontested divorce cost over $7000", "Why exactly did you stop having compassion? Her illness is very real... along with migraines. From what I understood it's because she doesn't seek therapy and relies on the church instead? That's why you are annoyed with her?", "Sammie's mama can pay for it all. It sure sounds like Sammie\u2019s been a princess for a hell of a lot longer than a day.", "Least of which is informing her daughter that actual Princesses have, like, actual money to spend on this insanity.", "I was 24, working full time and paid for my whole wedding except the cake (which my MIL chose and paid for, I didn't even see it until the reception). My whole wedding (including hineymoon) was less than she wants to pay for a dress! I think mine was 200?", "I snagged a sample dress for $100! It's beautiful, covered in lace. Because, you know wearing it for a few hours ONE day....", "My SO's Grandmother used to say \"If you raise your sons and daughters as princes and princesses You will be the one paying taxes.\"", "I bet she lives with her mom still, too, so no actual experience with making it in the real world.", "My wedding dress was 14k but it was Vera Wang. Pretty sure I've still got it somewhere.", "It makes no sense. None.", "Except if OPs son does well after college with a good job then the DIL would get child and spousal support because she was the stay at home mom and \u201csupported\u201d while going to college. And I mean supported emotionally since she works minimum wage jobs herself. This is just a recipe for disaster and OP should save her money for her sons divorce", "My wife and I got married on $500 total. Her grandmother made the cake. It was super small and done at her mom's house. The judge turned out to be the brother of a family friend (but we still paid his normal fee).", "I know someone who once told me \"that's what credit cards are for\" when discussing regular expenses and cutting out purchases \ud83d\ude2c. That's not a healthy mindset", "Depending on the brand and the size, it could be 2/3 of a new car (smallish, but still).", "I'm having a cheap wedding too so we can either go to Japan or Hawaii for our honeymoon! I don't understand paying more than $1k on a dress that I'll wear ONCE, let alone $10k! That's crazy!", "Mine only cost $160, which was the filing fee. My ex-husband waived service of process, and he wasn\u2019t even required to be in court.", "I didn't read it this way, but it not really better. Moms money can pay for the necessities so DIL moms contribution can be frivolous? No, especially when someone, not you, is paying for something for you, you aim lower and let the contributor say to spend more. \nDo your best to not need money from either parent. Then when parent ups how much they give or ( far more likely) aren't in bankruptcy because you spent too much. Never push the edges of a budget when spending gifted funds spend as little as possible, pocket the remainder of they have it to you, they want you to succeed after all. Or just tell them the lower price you find (presuming a plan of leftover funds) and let them cut a check for the item. \nIt's a gift not an entitlement.", "under $10,000 isn't a sh\\*t ton?
