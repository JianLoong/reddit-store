A huge part of housework is the mental load. Remembering where is what. Remembering what products are running out. Keeping track of what's in the fridge and when it will go off and needs to be eaten or thrown away. Stuff like that. A LOT of it. You have lived your life cluelessly while someone else was doing all this in the background. If you were aware of all the work that is being done in a household you wouldn't need to ask what you can help with. I'm not saying you are an AH because I understand you have very different priorities in life that chores, especially at your age. But I can see that your mom got annoyed.

Then be ready to do the work.  Be ready and open to learning.  It is our job as mothers to teach our children how to be independent and one of those skills is cleaning/house prep.  My mom never taught me how to clean and always said \u2018you have eyes\u2019 but that left me second guessing and feeling overwhelmed, not knowing where to start.  My kids are still quite young but I\u2019ve been teaching them already.

Taking out trash, vacuuming, doing dishes, sweep the yard? \n\nInstead, you walked around the house and couldn't find anything to do? Seriously? Is this the first party your mom has ever hosted?\n\nWhat are you going to do when you have your first apartment? Walk around, then call your mom and ask what you should do?", "NTA. You were just trying to be helpful and IMO your moms reaction was over the top for just asking a question.

Is it a shared thing with your sisters, or does your mom typically do everything?

People who communicate like your mom are AHs.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA.\n\nMy family was like this, my mum never told me what she needed to be done and just did it herself when I hadn't done it. I, just like OP, cannot read our mother's minds. \n\nIt only changed when I had a long talk with my mum and told her to write a list down of stuff that needs to be done, when one is done to cross it off the list so that we don't need to to keep asking what needs to be done and just do it.

This is the best solution imo", "YTA. You are 17, not 5. If you were used to help your mom it should have been evident what needed to be done.", "NTA. Sometimes adults expect younger people to think the same. Maybe you never hosted a gathering and that\u2019s why you asked for instruction? Maybe mom was so caught up and stressed with planning? Sisters siding with mom is not surprising since mom is the only parent at home. Use this as a learning experience when helping others or when to offer help.", "Jfc is everyone a mind reader?\n\nIf you ask \"what can i do to help\" and are told \"you have eyes\", that is not a complete answer.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nAs the mom of teens, though, I can tell you it's extremely frustrating to have to do all. the. things. Having to come up with an assignment for you is just another thing while she has a million party things to get ready.  She's probably stressed out and while asking to help seems kind (and it is), it would have been better for you to say, \"mom, would you like me to take the garbage out?\"\n\nHopefully she's not always like this and you just caught her at a bad moment.", "NTA. \n\nIf you were a little older and had been living on your own for a bit, I would probably answer differently, because I get why your mom sighed . . . she probably carries the weight of  not only a lot of the chores but the mental labour of organising your household, and it gets exhausting having to direct people all the time if you don't want to do everything yourself.\n\nBUT . . .\n\nAt 17, while you are still entirely capable of helping, you haven't been running a household and you're still learning about what that entails. It's not that you're not aware that vacuuming, emptying the trash, etc. are necessary things . . . but you're still young enough that it likely hasn't been necessary for you to pay much attention to it. She's your parent, and it's her job to teach you. You're not her adult spouse, you're her kid - and a good one who is actually trying to get involved and be helpful - and you still need some guidance to comprehend which tasks need to be done when. At 17 I was happy to vacuum for my mum, but I would never have noticed that something \"needed vacuuming\". That takes time and experience. I get that she's weary . . . boy do I ever . . . but this is the time to guide you so that in a year or two you won't need it anymore.", "I\u2019m shocked at all the YTA. Personally if someone says to me you know what has to be done I wouldn\u2019t know. Some people don\u2019t know what needs to be done and need explaining. \n\nFor me personally, I can do what is asked I just need them to clarify what it is they\u2019re asking.

No way could I had worked out what needs doing.\n\nProbably going to sound weird, but this is a skill that needs cultivating and it is way more important than it could possibly feel like it is right now.

In the future it will translate to everywhere you live and every place you work.\n\nDoesn't really matter who the AH is, honestly this is standard Mum and 17yo Son stuff.\n\nPro tip: offer to help with cooking. You'll be very glad about that decision one day.", "NTA clearly she has spent enough time teaching you how to be an adult and that\u2019s on her not you.  Your heart was in the right place.", "ESH. At 17 you should be able to spot things that could be done. At the same time you\u2019re willing to help and asked; reasonably your mom could have had priorities about what needed to be done. She over reacted in my view. You also could have done one thing when she sent you off to look before coming back. Seems like crappy communication all the way round.", "NAH, but I can totally see where your mom is coming from. Household chores can be gendered with women having to manage and take care of most of them. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s feeling overwhelmed because of this.

That\u2019s not gutsy, that\u2019s just dumb.", "NAH. Bruh I'm mad stupid when it comes to chores and stuff so I totally get you and I get that you can be confused about what needs to be done. That being said your mom is already super stressed out by the preparations and you asking over and over again is stressing her out more. She kinda just lashed out because you were nearby is all, don't judge her too harshly for it.", "ESH\n\nYou asked a genuine question because you either couldn't tell what she wanted done or you were unsure of what she would and wouldn't want you to do. Now it is likely you should be able to pick up on what needs to be done by now. You should be able to spot and do these things on your own. Not seeing that in the moment doesn't make you TA. Asking for clarification doesn't make you one either, but it did likely stress her out. She shouldn't have lashed out at you like that. \n\nDid you respectfully let her know how you felt about her reaction? So long as you weren't rude I believe children, especially near adult children, should be able to openly communicate with their parents. Arguing and telling then how they should parent is a completely different story. It sounds like your family has a habit of talking down to you. No one should be dumped on. I'm sorry. I'm a parent who believes in apologizing to my children if I lose my cool. I can respect my kids enough to know when they don't deserve what I gave them. \n\nI think you're ok in general, but maybe need to stand up for yourself more respectfully. Just work a little on making sure you have all the needed life skills to make it outside of your parents' house and contribute inside it as well.", "Sounds like a no win situation.  Pretty sure even if you had found some chore to occupy yourself with, she would have been mad that it wasn't the task that was an obvious priority to her.", "NAH\n\nIt was harsh but at 17 shouldn\u2019t you know how to help?\n\nWe\u2019re your sisters told to help?", "Nta\n\nYou're young, it's their job to teach you to find what has to be done \n\nMostly if you have ADHD\n\nI mean unless it was fucking obvious like clothes in the middle of the rooms", "NTA apparently no one had the decency to teach to clean too and now your parent is blaming you instead of finally teaching you I think it's just a stupid reaction from your mom when you were actually trying to help and were willing to be taught", "NTA\n\nWhen you are looking at a situation, take a deep breath, look for things you can do, don\u2019t wait for someone to tell you exactly what to do. \n\nRemember some of the chores you have been assigned before, check them out. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair that kids get micro management all through childhood, then get yelled at for waiting to be\u2026micromanaged.\n\nAlso get checked for anxiety, based on this situation it would be weird if your parents didn\u2019t give you anxiety", "NAH. Apparently your mom didn't teach you the difference between a clean and a dirty house, so it might not be your fault that you didn't see what needs to be done. I hope you can catch up on that knowledge before you have to take care of your own home.\n\nAt the same time, your mother has better things to do than to teach you right before she expects guests, so it's no wonder she got angry that you kept bothering her.

Talk with her again when you both calmed down.", "Soft YTA. The same things need to be done to keep a house up, on rotation, basically always.

Completely agree with others who have said that the solution is to find a time when his mom isn't busy and make a list of chores that need to get done, and have her demonstrate some of those chores if needed. After making the list, then next time he sees his mom and sisters doing chores, he can jump in without asking, no additional communication needed.\n\nFor those commenters who are saying that OP should just be observant and pick up on what his mom regularly does around the house, I think this is an unfair expectation for many reasons.

Do they separate trash from recycling? Etc.)

So here is my advice for you, if you'd like to start helping: pick one thing and start doing it routinely. Start with the trash, you see it's getting full, take it out. Make this a habit every time you throw something away and take it out when it's getting full, not overflowing. Once you've made a good habit of that, pick something else.

Vacuum,  dishes, toilet; ect. What this shows is that you don't help around the house on a regular bases", "YTA. Your mother was telling you, in an admittedly impatient way, that she wants you to look for what needs to be done, and not bother her by asking. It's not that hard to learn how to see what needs doing. In the future, instead of asking, look at the garbage and see if it needs emptying, or look at the carpet to see it needs vacuuming. Or if it's been awhile, just assume it needs vacuuming and do it. Same goes for the dishes, the lawn. I don't understand why you feel the need to ask, but obviously your mother is sick of it.

In need of direction? Sure, but I think your heart is in the right place and I very much appreciate that you offered to help. It\u2019s more than many 17yo would do (very sadly). \n\nThis is a good opportunity to learn several important life lessons. First, you\u2019re learning about mental load and how Moms are pretty much universally tasked with running everything in their household.  It\u2019s exhausting all the time and can be downright soul-crushing on a regular basis. That\u2019s what was behind the sigh and the tone. It was one more issue that her brain had to solve and she was reaching her wit\u2019s end. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious your mom wants more out of you at this age, and frankly adulthood is coming fast so you need to know these things anyway, in order to be a decent roommate or self-sufficient adult. \n\nSo, learning how to do the chores & taking initiative to do them *without being told* are the interrelated next 2 life lessons. There are all kinds of YouTube videos and web resources from which you can learn to do chores properly. There are resources on how often each chore needs to be done, too, and what materials to use. Your sisters probably watched your mom do chores closely as they grew up while you did not, so you have some catching up to do. \n\nAnd you may have to train yourself to \u201csee\u201d (assess) the level of cleanliness in your home if you\u2019ve never learned to look at it that way. There are people who can \u201clook\u201d at a countertop and not see crumbs that are obvious to most other people, because they have trained themselves to see past dirt or mess. Or not \u201csee\u201d the grime buildup in the tub, or dust & dirt in the corners. \n\nJust remember this: your living environment is both a reflection of and a contributor to your overall mental health. It\u2019s important to learn to keep it a healthy place.", "NTA- I get both sides tbh. If the house was horribly messy I can see why she would think \"isn't it obvious what I need help with?\"  Thing is, people have different views on cleanliness standard. I see no problem in asking what someone needs help with because it's good to know top priority of what needs to be done when people come over. You are still offering to help and I would appreciate that.\n\nAlso however, I do not know what your exact wording was or tone was. Sometimes people ask that question only to barely do anything and only act like they are helping. Whole I do not think you are the asshole I was not there myself to give true judgement.

Even when I was just the girlfriend, before we got married, I never asked my mother-in-law if she wanted help, I saw what needed to be done, and I did it. From the experience I have with one of my younger brothers, when we were already out of our mother's house and sharing a house, he always pretended that he didn't see what needed to be done, and when we complained to him, he blamed it on us, that we didn't tell him to do this or that!

She was definitely already carrying that vacuuming was needed and the trash had to be taken out. \n\nFrom my perspective as a SAHM, who does the vast majority of the housework, 10 times out of 10 I would prefer being asked, \u201cwhat can I help with\u201d over someone picking a random task, because then that task is explicitly taken OFF my mental load. I can remove it before it\u2019s even completed because I know someone else has taken responsibility for it. I can also direct them to what I feel is the most pressing task in need of attention, again decreasing my mental load. \n\nThere is something to be said about someone showing initiative and addressing a household need. But at the same time communicating with the others around you to more effectively approach and complete all needed tasks shouldn\u2019t be discouraged. \n\nMy husband, in the 10 years we have been married, takes the trash out 95% of the time. I literally only take it out when he is not home and it is FULL and I have more trash to add. And I KNOW he will take it out, by his own initiative, unprompted by me. However, every time that bag starts to look full there\u2019s a sticky note about it added to the house upkeep file in my mental load. Someone else taking initiative doesn\u2019t just eliminate that mental load. \n\nAnd just from the comment OP\u2019s mom made, it very much feels like she explicitly taught her daughters how she expects the house to be prepared for guests, and didn\u2019t do the same for her son, which is a failure on her part because men equally need to know how to care for their living space. But even with that assumption, it\u2019s clear that OP understands the home needs to be prepared for guests and wants to help share in that responsibility. \n\nThere\u2019s also a difference in what an adult vs a 17 year old would set their standard as \u201cclean\u201d. I, as an adult, know that even if the carpets *look* clean, they definitely need vacuumed if it\u2019s been a few days. However, from a 17 year old\u2019s perspective (and honestly I wouldn\u2019t put this past someone pushing 30 or more) if the carpets *look* clean there\u2019s no urgent need to vacuum them. Was the garbage can literally overflowing or half full? Overflowing is clear and obvious. Half full, a seasoned adult will know that it\u2019s best to empty it before having guests so it doesn\u2019t need to be emptied mid get-together, but a teen will likely see half full and think there\u2019s plenty more room for trash. \n\nOP, you are not TA. You didn\u2019t go to your mom and tell her \u201coh by the way xyz is a total mess, you should probably clean that,\u201d which certainly *would* have added to her mental load. What kind of world are we living in where a 17 year old asking \u201cWhat task can I do to help you out?\u201d is TA? He isn\u2019t sitting on the couch or stowed away in his room avoiding any work. OP recognized that there was more work to be done and asked to be directed toward a pressing task. Reddit is wild.", "Right.

Groceries, cooking, cleaning, maintenance, eveything that needs to be done in the home.

But this is still your journey, so it's up to you to take whatever steps you need to become your best self. \n\nStart with the tasks that used to be on the chore chart.

Seems obvious the mom taught the daughters how to maintain the house but he was never required or given any guidance at all on it.", "Oh please you can\u2019t know someone\u2019s expectations of what they want done to get ready for company unless they have been taught those expectations! Quite obviously he\u2019s willing to do the work he just very obviously hasn\u2019t been taught her expectations. At 17! I didn\u2019t need to be told because *MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME* her expectations years and years before. She taught me that before I could physically do all of the work. I didn\u2019t learn by \u201cwatching\u201d her! You can\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in someone\u2019s head by just \u201cwatching\u201d them! That\u2019s one of the most ridiculous things people say!", "YouTube you can find a video of almost everything", "Okay, and OP asked to help. That makes him an AH? You're missing the part where this person was raised in this environment. You don't have to agree or like it, but it isn't their fault they were raised with outdated gender roles. OP made a nice gesture, despite it not being something that was modeled for him, and his mom was rude. If she wanted him to be a well rounded and more capable human, she probably should have started teaching him that at 7. Either way, 17 yo asks to help, you let them help, end of discussion.", "I disagree on your take. According to your comment mothers should teach only their daughters and fathers -  only their sons. That is sexist. The blame falls on both parents not on one. \n\nFor instance, if mother was SAHM in most cases she is better at taking care of the house. She does it daily, she has more experience so she can teach others more properly. Daughters and sons equally.", "Weaponized incompetence is the new gaslighting. Not every lie is gaslighting and not every show of incompetence is weaponized.", "At 17 I remember being yelled at for chores I was never taught. I vacuumed, I cleaned my room. I asked me mom to teach me to clean a toilet, she did not. Then she yelled at me for not knowing. So sorry, I don\u2019t buy that.", "Or assigned chores in general.  There's a big difference between just \"doing your chores\" and actively looking to see what needs to be done at any particular moment.", "Yeah, this was huge for me as well, as a guy. My roles were expected to be lifting and carrying, moving stuff, maybe some quick repairs, buying in bulk. Sure I helped out wherever but I never had a reason for a lot of it.\n\nYour anecdote about sweeping the floor is spot on. Sure if I swept the workroom I paid attention to sawdust, nails, etc, but I didn\u2019t even see what the goal was for the kitchen floor. Similarly I never had any reason to notice why you\u2019d sweep before mopping.  It was just extra work so my Mom would be less anxious. It takes doing it a few times, being responsible for the _results_, not just the action, or at least someone pointing it out", ">\tKids don\u2019t generally google how to clean a house for guests to arrive\n\nIn my day the internet didn\u2019t exist; neither did electricity.  We used to sacrifice a chicken to see if the house required vacuuming.\n\n/j, by the by.", "Ah yes because you\u2019ve never learned anything about maintaining a home that wasn\u2019t explicitly taught to you by a parent.", "Who\u2019s to say she didn\u2019t? Like I mentioned in a previous comment, that kind of exasperation from mom comes from years of showing/telling OP what to do and still having to deal with weaponized incompetence.", "Same I've been there before. All you learn is that if you ask if they need help you'll get yelled. In turn you learn that if you stay locked in your room instead, no one will bother you 95% of the time. That's what my teenage self learned and it's definitely affected me through my adult years.", "The devil is in the details, and while you can work a lot of it out, it is far more smooth to be taught by someone with experience. Who already knows a lot of the finer details themself.\n\nThat's how we move forward as a society in practically anything. Lots of incremental improvements overtime being passed down between generations.\n\nThe more in-your-face example of this is safety regulations being written in blood. You can be diligent, experienced and work out a lot of the finer details, but you aren't guaranteed to be fools proof. You need a \"checklist\" (mentally or physically), a lot of which is ideally filled out by others showing you the bulletpoints.\n\nHence why it is so important to have someone who's capable of showing active feedback and explaination. Googling is great, but not a replacement.\n Google can't look at what youre doing and pinpointing where you messed up. Not yet anyway.", "i'm 35 and google how to clean things....... not everyone's parents bothered to teach them that stuff. and how is he supposed to know if he hasn't learned it before?", "Sure, and the fault he is behind falls to the 2 people who were supposed to teach and nature him, his mom and dad.", "See, it's this kind of willingness to throw OP into a weird box of inability by both you and his female relatives that's making me concerned that what's actually at work here is some kind of hatred against teens or males or just OP in particular.\n\nLike fucking seriously, you have a 17 year old offering to help and asking for guidance and you and his mother choose to shame him. Instead of pointing out what could be done or how, giving him a list to follow-through with or just asking for help with the task she was doing then, his mother chose to shame him and make him feel worse for it.\n\nBang-up job, you guys. I'd say something like 'the way you *people* treat OP is kind of disgusting,' but that implies I think of you as people and that impression is quickly fading as you continue to damn a 17 year old for wanting to help out and asking for some pointers in so doing.", "And his parents probably should have done something to prevent that, but they didnt", "And now you wander into assumption territory."]}
