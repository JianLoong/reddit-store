A huge part of housework is the mental load. Remembering where is what. Remembering what products are running out. Keeping track of what's in the fridge and when it will go off and needs to be eaten or thrown away. Stuff like that. A LOT of it. You have lived your life cluelessly while someone else was doing all this in the background. If you were aware of all the work that is being done in a household you wouldn't need to ask what you can help with. I'm not saying you are an AH because I understand you have very different priorities in life that chores, especially at your age. But I can see that your mom got annoyed.

Then be ready to do the work.  Be ready and open to learning.  It is our job as mothers to teach our children how to be independent and one of those skills is cleaning/house prep.  My mom never taught me how to clean and always said \u2018you have eyes\u2019 but that left me second guessing and feeling overwhelmed, not knowing where to start.  My kids are still quite young but I\u2019ve been teaching them already.

Sometimes adults expect younger people to think the same. Maybe you never hosted a gathering and that\u2019s why you asked for instruction? Maybe mom was so caught up and stressed with planning?

Having to come up with an assignment for you is just another thing while she has a million party things to get ready.

It's not that you're not aware that vacuuming, emptying the trash, etc. are necessary things . . . but you're still young enough that it likely hasn't been necessary for you to pay much attention to it. She's your parent, and it's her job to teach you. You're not her adult spouse, you're her kid - and a good one who is actually trying to get involved and be helpful - and you still need some guidance to comprehend which tasks need to be done when. At 17 I was happy to vacuum for my mum, but I would never have noticed that something \"needed vacuuming\". That takes time and experience. I get that she's weary . . . boy do I ever . . . but this is the time to guide you so that in a year or two you won't need it anymore.", "I\u2019m shocked at all the YTA. Personally if someone says to me you know what has to be done I wouldn\u2019t know. Some people don\u2019t know what needs to be done and need explaining. \n\nFor me personally, I can do what is asked I just need them to clarify what it is they\u2019re asking.

At 17 you should be able to spot things that could be done. At the same time you\u2019re willing to help and asked; reasonably your mom could have had priorities about what needed to be done.

Seems like crappy communication all the way round.", "NAH, but I can totally see where your mom is coming from. Household chores can be gendered with women having to manage and take care of most of them. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s feeling overwhelmed because of this.

That being said your mom is already super stressed out by the preparations and you asking over and over again is stressing her out more. She kinda just lashed out because you were nearby is all, don't judge her too harshly for it.", "ESH\n\nYou asked a genuine question because you either couldn't tell what she wanted done or you were unsure of what she would and wouldn't want you to do. Now it is likely you should be able to pick up on what needs to be done by now. You should be able to spot and do these things on your own. Not seeing that in the moment doesn't make you TA. Asking for clarification doesn't make you one either, but it did likely stress her out. She shouldn't have lashed out at you like that. \n\nDid you respectfully let her know how you felt about her reaction? So long as you weren't rude I believe children, especially near adult children, should be able to openly communicate with their parents. Arguing and telling then how they should parent is a completely different story. It sounds like your family has a habit of talking down to you. No one should be dumped on. I'm sorry. I'm a parent who believes in apologizing to my children if I lose my cool. I can respect my kids enough to know when they don't deserve what I gave them. \n\nI think you're ok in general, but maybe need to stand up for yourself more respectfully. Just work a little on making sure you have all the needed life skills to make it outside of your parents' house and contribute inside it as well.", "Sounds like a no win situation.  Pretty sure even if you had found some chore to occupy yourself with, she would have been mad that it wasn't the task that was an obvious priority to her.", "NAH\n\nIt was harsh but at 17 shouldn\u2019t you know how to help?\n\nWe\u2019re your sisters told to help?", "Nta\n\nYou're young, it's their job to teach you to find what has to be done \n\nMostly if you have ADHD\n\nI mean unless it was fucking obvious like clothes in the middle of the rooms", "NTA apparently no one had the decency to teach to clean too and now your parent is blaming you instead of finally teaching you I think it's just a stupid reaction from your mom when you were actually trying to help and were willing to be taught", "NTA\n\nWhen you are looking at a situation, take a deep breath, look for things you can do, don\u2019t wait for someone to tell you exactly what to do. \n\nRemember some of the chores you have been assigned before, check them out. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair that kids get micro management all through childhood, then get yelled at for waiting to be\u2026micromanaged.\n\nAlso get checked for anxiety, based on this situation it would be weird if your parents didn\u2019t give you anxiety", "NAH. Apparently your mom didn't teach you the difference between a clean and a dirty house, so it might not be your fault that you didn't see what needs to be done. I hope you can catch up on that knowledge before you have to take care of your own home.\n\nAt the same time, your mother has better things to do than to teach you right before she expects guests, so it's no wonder she got angry that you kept bothering her.

Completely agree with others who have said that the solution is to find a time when his mom isn't busy and make a list of chores that need to get done, and have her demonstrate some of those chores if needed. After making the list, then next time he sees his mom and sisters doing chores, he can jump in without asking, no additional communication needed.\n\nFor those commenters who are saying that OP should just be observant and pick up on what his mom regularly does around the house, I think this is an unfair expectation for many reasons.

Do they separate trash from recycling? Etc.)

So here is my advice for you, if you'd like to start helping: pick one thing and start doing it routinely. Start with the trash, you see it's getting full, take it out. Make this a habit every time you throw something away and take it out when it's getting full, not overflowing. Once you've made a good habit of that, pick something else.

You might\u2019ve been the hero of this story but you couldn\u2019t keep a cool head.", "NTA. She spent all your life not teaching you the same way she taught her sisters and now she can't take two seconds to just tell you wtf to do but has the energy to argue.", "YTA\nYou could of politely tried to clarify what she would prefer or which area of the home to start with. Vacuum,  dishes, toilet; ect. What this shows is that you don't help around the house on a regular bases", "YTA. Your mother was telling you, in an admittedly impatient way, that she wants you to look for what needs to be done, and not bother her by asking. It's not that hard to learn how to see what needs doing. In the future, instead of asking, look at the garbage and see if it needs emptying, or look at the carpet to see it needs vacuuming. Or if it's been awhile, just assume it needs vacuuming and do it. Same goes for the dishes, the lawn. I don't understand why you feel the need to ask, but obviously your mother is sick of it. Sorry you don't like her tone, but your mother has put up with your nasty teenage shit for years.", "NAH, and I\u2019m sorry that people are calling you an asshole, because you aren\u2019t. Clueless? In need of direction? Sure, but I think your heart is in the right place and I very much appreciate that you offered to help. It\u2019s more than many 17yo would do (very sadly). \n\nThis is a good opportunity to learn several important life lessons. First, you\u2019re learning about mental load and how Moms are pretty much universally tasked with running everything in their household.  It\u2019s exhausting all the time and can be downright soul-crushing on a regular basis. That\u2019s what was behind the sigh and the tone. It was one more issue that her brain had to solve and she was reaching her wit\u2019s end. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious your mom wants more out of you at this age, and frankly adulthood is coming fast so you need to know these things anyway, in order to be a decent roommate or self-sufficient adult. \n\nSo, learning how to do the chores & taking initiative to do them *without being told* are the interrelated next 2 life lessons. There are all kinds of YouTube videos and web resources from which you can learn to do chores properly. There are resources on how often each chore needs to be done, too, and what materials to use. Your sisters probably watched your mom do chores closely as they grew up while you did not, so you have some catching up to do. \n\nAnd you may have to train yourself to \u201csee\u201d (assess) the level of cleanliness in your home if you\u2019ve never learned to look at it that way. There are people who can \u201clook\u201d at a countertop and not see crumbs that are obvious to most other people, because they have trained themselves to see past dirt or mess. Or not \u201csee\u201d the grime buildup in the tub, or dust & dirt in the corners. \n\nJust remember this: your living environment is both a reflection of and a contributor to your overall mental health. It\u2019s important to learn to keep it a healthy place.", "NTA- I get both sides tbh. If the house was horribly messy I can see why she would think \"isn't it obvious what I need help with?\"  Thing is, people have different views on cleanliness standard. I see no problem in asking what someone needs help with because it's good to know top priority of what needs to be done when people come over. You are still offering to help and I would appreciate that.\n\nAlso however, I do not know what your exact wording was or tone was. Sometimes people ask that question only to barely do anything and only act like they are helping. Whole I do not think you are the asshole I was not there myself to give true judgement. Asking in of itself was not the true issue here.", "NTA", "this is with a partner view but is the same issue:  \n[https://english.emmaclit.com/2022/09/01/where-does-it-go/](https://english.emmaclit.com/2022/09/01/where-does-it-go/)  \n\n\nwhile if you are a her child and still a kid, so is not fully your fault, is a good opportunity to learn about this, better early than late!", "INFO: Do you have ASD by any chance?

At my (ex) parents-in-law's house, a very conservative and traditional family with 3 girls and 3 boys, the girls did most of the chores, but the boys also participated, one of them even cooked one of the weekend days, on his own initiative. Even when I was just the girlfriend, before we got married, I never asked my mother-in-law if she wanted help, I saw what needed to be done, and I did it. From the experience I have with one of my younger brothers, when we were already out of our mother's house and sharing a house, he always pretended that he didn't see what needed to be done, and when we complained to him, he blamed it on us, that we didn't tell him to do this or that! I know it was an excuse because I knew how he was raised and what he did at our mom's house.", "I think your reasoning is exactly why OP is NTA. Without knowing what needs to be done, you can\u2019t be expected to know what you don\u2019t know. \n\nI know that asking for tasks to do can be exhausting but if it\u2019s your child earnestly asking, teach them. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t understand how any of this goes back to a \u201cgood male role model\u201d", "NTA.

She was definitely already carrying that vacuuming was needed and the trash had to be taken out. \n\nFrom my perspective as a SAHM, who does the vast majority of the housework, 10 times out of 10 I would prefer being asked, \u201cwhat can I help with\u201d over someone picking a random task, because then that task is explicitly taken OFF my mental load. I can remove it before it\u2019s even completed because I know someone else has taken responsibility for it. I can also direct them to what I feel is the most pressing task in need of attention, again decreasing my mental load. \n\nThere is something to be said about someone showing initiative and addressing a household need. But at the same time communicating with the others around you to more effectively approach and complete all needed tasks shouldn\u2019t be discouraged. \n\nMy husband, in the 10 years we have been married, takes the trash out 95% of the time. I literally only take it out when he is not home and it is FULL and I have more trash to add. And I KNOW he will take it out, by his own initiative, unprompted by me. However, every time that bag starts to look full there\u2019s a sticky note about it added to the house upkeep file in my mental load. Someone else taking initiative doesn\u2019t just eliminate that mental load. \n\nAnd just from the comment OP\u2019s mom made, it very much feels like she explicitly taught her daughters how she expects the house to be prepared for guests, and didn\u2019t do the same for her son, which is a failure on her part because men equally need to know how to care for their living space. But even with that assumption, it\u2019s clear that OP understands the home needs to be prepared for guests and wants to help share in that responsibility. \n\nThere\u2019s also a difference in what an adult vs a 17 year old would set their standard as \u201cclean\u201d. I, as an adult, know that even if the carpets *look* clean, they definitely need vacuumed if it\u2019s been a few days. However, from a 17 year old\u2019s perspective (and honestly I wouldn\u2019t put this past someone pushing 30 or more) if the carpets *look* clean there\u2019s no urgent need to vacuum them. Was the garbage can literally overflowing or half full? Overflowing is clear and obvious. Half full, a seasoned adult will know that it\u2019s best to empty it before having guests so it doesn\u2019t need to be emptied mid get-together, but a teen will likely see half full and think there\u2019s plenty more room for trash. \n\nOP, you are not TA. You didn\u2019t go to your mom and tell her \u201coh by the way xyz is a total mess, you should probably clean that,\u201d which certainly *would* have added to her mental load. What kind of world are we living in where a 17 year old asking \u201cWhat task can I do to help you out?\u201d is TA? He isn\u2019t sitting on the couch or stowed away in his room avoiding any work. OP recognized that there was more work to be done and asked to be directed toward a pressing task. Reddit is wild.", "Right.  Even if it\u2019s true that the kid should be more aware of what needs to be done without prompting\u2014a not at all uncommon challenge for teenagers\u2014mom\u2019s shitty attitude simply taught this kid that the safest thing to do in the future is not to ask if they can help at all.", "EXACTLY.", "I'm failing to see how this is independent and doesn't put 100% of the mental load/household management on the mother.", "Following a list of explicit chores that someone else has had to write for you is being independent?", "I am honestly astounded it took me this long to find a NTA.

Groceries, cooking, cleaning, maintenance, eveything that needs to be done in the home.

All that checklist goes away. I get to check the box for \"laundry\" in my brain without running through every other aspect of that checklist. My mental load is reduced even though I delegated. That's... that's how delegation works? Like I'm baffled that this is an argument. I don't know where the notion that \"delegation is as much labor as performing tasks\" came from, but it is not an accurate reflection of reality. \n\nOr, rather, if in your personal opinion, delegation IS as much work as actually carrying out tasks, then... I guess you should just do all the work and stop complaining? Sounds like you want it done your way regardless, and no one's gonna perform the task to your specifications, which you are unwilling to provide, so. Enjoy your labor, both mental and physical.

We have different standards, and the house being \"ready\" for guests is an entirely subjective state that is judged from a position of authority. The child is not that authority in this instance, and I dunno about you, but most 17 year olds have pretty different standards than their parents when it comes to \"ready for guests.\"\n\nSo this 17 year old looks around and thinks, \"jeez, this place looks ready to me, but mom is still cleaning, so I guess there's more to be done.

For a few reasons:\n\n1. This was an event, not a weekly housecleaning. If it were the latter, then OP would have much less of an excuse not to know what needed to be done. Even if he doesn't normally do the housecleaning, he presumably would have seen his parents/sisters doing it, and should have some idea of where to start.\n\nBut with an event, you're doing different kinds of preparation that are not standard \u2014 you might be carrying chairs downstairs, adding a leaf to the table, setting out snacks, running last-minute errands. So I don't think it was unreasonable for OP to ask what needed to be done.\n\n2. Kids are not always great at prioritizing and judging what needs to be done. I used to really like helping my mom clean the house... but I still had to be told what to do.\n\nI think that's partly because I was a kid/teen, but also partly because it wasn't really my house \u2014 I lived there, obviously, but I didn't make decisions about when the floor needed to be vacuumed, or the bathroom cleaned. My mom told me what to do when, so I never bothered thinking about when a rug was dirty enough to need vacuuming. Being able to judge when a chore needs to be done might seem really obvious, but some people need to be trained to \"see\" those things.\n\n3. Weaponized incompetence (which you don't name, but sounds like what you're referring to), in my experience, is usually used in order to get out of doing something. But that's not what OP was doing \u2014 unless he left it out, his mom didn't ask him for help; he volunteered. I feel like when someone volunteers to help you out, it's neither kind nor productive to yell at them for not already knowing what to do.\n\nHaving said all that, I *am* curious about a couple things given the disparity between him and his sisters. Were they all equally taught and required to do chores? Is it a difference in ability? Or is it simply a difference in attitude (i.e. willingness to help out without being asked)?\n\nOverall, I think the issues you raise are important ones for OP to keep in mind, but because of all of the above, I wouldn't jump straight to the conclusion that he's being lazy, when he might simply be young/neurodivergent/untrained.", "Counterpoint: my mom always had an invisible list and I was routinely screamed at (not just yelled, but full-on screamed at) for not knowing what was on it and what order things were to be done in, so no, just looking at things at diving in is not manifestly obvious. I was just expected to know.", ">Long term however OP would never have realised that using his own judgement on what needs doing is a skill he is expected to develop, which was apparently something he did not know based on his post and comments. Long term, life will be easier for him and anyone he ever lives with now he knows that\n\nWouldn't it be cool if there were two particular people who were meant to teach him that? And to help him develop that judgement? One might even say it's their job to make sure he learns that and develops that judgement?", "1. It's not normal for your parents to hit you, period. It's not something to be proud of or brag about, its sad. \n\n2. If his mom has been saying that to him I can understand why it's something he'd repeat. If the people you look to for modeling social interactions say certain things, you're likely to do the same.", "I don't recall OP saying he was raised by a single mom. Why is it only the mom's job to teach him how to be a contributing member of the household?", "I'm  a married man and i still ask my wife what i need to clean specifically. I'm a lot better at seeing the normal stuff when we have guests but not the stuff on a daily basis. \n\nSo OP is NTA", "I think sometimes you can end up in a catch 22 situation.  You don't ask, you just do something that you think needs doing, and they say, \"no, not that way...and do this other thing first; it's more urgent!\". But they wouldn't tell you when you asked.  It wouldn't take much to just tell OP, \"vacuum the living room and then take out the trash\" when he specifically asked what he could do. It's kind of an AH move for the mom to say OP should just know what her cleaning/preparation priorities are.  Two people could look at the same house and draw different conclusions about what needs doing.\n\nOP, NTA, but maybe ask to sit down with mom sometime when she's not busy and get a list of things you can do around the house on a regular basis.

My sister always seemed to know exactly what and I\u2019ve often suspected it\u2019s why they were always a little bit closer. \n\nBut as a host, I just ask or when people ask, immediately thank them and assign them to something.

The feeling that someone is looming out of sight *perceiving* me do these chores makes me feel so... exposed and anxious.

Every one of us had different parents. Everyone cleans differently and has a different definition of clean. If someone asks me  what help I need to make the home company ready, I'm ecstatic and tell them what I need done. My level of 'clean' is higher than my fiance or his brother, who currently lives with us. When we have family parties and I'm driving myself crazy with my deep clean, both of them ask me what I need done. Both of them know how to clean, to what their level is. Mine is higher due to trauma, so they ask me what needs to be done. This doesn't make them lazy, this just means we have different levels of clean and that I'm really damaged and have really high standards.\n\nThey do more day to day (surface) cleaning than I do, whereas I do these insane, day long deep cleans. I personally think their level of cleaning is healthier (and reduces the time I have to deep clean). But I simply can not clean anything unless it's a deep clean, and that's not always possible.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say at the end of the day is that learning to clean can be traumatic and don't assume. At the end of the day, every single one of us is different and has different tolerance levels. Anyone asking how they can help someone with higher standards should not be shut down.\n\n(This tirade, though, absolutely does not cover people who are weaponized incompetent. They are a special level of hell everyone should avoid. My Fiance and I had different standards.

And just to add cause there\u2019s a lot of people saying OP is an ass for being old enough to know better, if someone (like a parent) is clearly in charge of things, it\u2019s a good idea to ask what they need because they know. If you start doing what you think, there\u2019s not a zero chance you make a mistake. Sure things like garbage or cleaning up might be obvious, but does she need help chopping stuff, is she missing an ingredient OP could run off to the store for, a million things that wouldn\u2019t be obvious ways to help unless you\u2019re let in on the plan.

Unless a carpet is really dirty I can find it hard to tell whether it needs vacuuming or already has been recently. Or if guests are coming over and we're in 'quick clean mode', I'm not going to think that dusting is a priority. I'm going to think 'what will make the most impact on what guests will notice' and go from there.

I\u2019m also the only one of the kids who seems to actually enjoy hosting and thinks about the guest experience. \n\nDomestic intuition and being generally aware/thoughtful can be gendered learning, but it can also just be inclination and interest.", "I seriously don't know if people here realise they're calling a goddamn child an Asshole for wanting to help. Kids get a pass for absolutely everything in this sub, but a guy not knowing everything about household duties/chores is an Asshole apparently.", "I'm 35 and just don't see stuff like that. It's a lifelong issue and a frequent grievance people have with me ever since I was a child, and believe me, I've put in a lot of effort to learn, but it never made a dent. I'm totally in the woods without reminders on my phone (there's some cool apps for that, so I'm clearly not alone). I only notice when the mess gets in the way of me doing other things, but half the time I get distracted and don't follow up on it after I finish the first task anyway. I have no problem cleaning, but I just don't see when things need to be done and can't prioritize for shit. Thank god for my external auxiliary brain (phone).\n\nThere's all manner of people in the world.", "That's....not the mental load. The mental load is being the only one who seems to notice that a chore needs to be done, and having to be the one that makes sure it gets done by either doing it or assigning it. \n\nBut... children are part of the mental load. Like... this is inappropriate on so many levels.", "Try to be more aware and proactive, if you can. It is additional to work to have to manage someone else. Maybe pick one or two tasks for yourself that are yours, so your wife doesn\u2019t have to think about them.\n\nExamples would be: loading and unloading the dishwasher, folding laundry, and taking out the garbage. Make a note on your phone, or whatever you need as a reminder, and do those handful of tasks every day. It\u2019s a little thing, but I think it would be a big relief to your wife.", "No, because Mom might have very specific tasks she wants done first, or in a certain way, or wants to handle herself.\n\n\"How can I help\" isn't emotional abuse.\n\n\"If you need to ask, you're a terrible person,\" though, is.", "So if son asks to be taught, it's mental load, and the best solution is for mom to teach son.\n\nGotcha.", "What issues are we talking here? How does the reddit being mostly young adult women explain that?", "im a woman and im like this, and my mom gets so annoyed about it lol", "Don't help if your mother gets angry when you help, just stay in your room so you don't fight anymore.", "NTA. You can\u2019t read her mind.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour mom is an adult, you are a child. She should be giving a direct answer to your question rather than resorting to petty passive-aggressive bullshit.", "NTA, unless you are a mind reader. I mean you offered to help and instead of taking you up on that offer she decided to make it some sort of puzzle to be solved", "I'm going with NTA. You were trying. I often get frustrated with my husband because he doesn't just SEE what needs done and do it. It frustrates the hell out of me, much like your mom was at that moment. But by communicating with him what I see he's getting better at it. There's also something to be said about the hierarchy of chores. I don't care if the shelves aren't dusted, just start the dang laundry already. Keep trying. You're doing great.", "I'm going to say NTA. I'm a mom who also wants my kids to see the work that needs to be done and not have to be told. HOWEVER, you were not waiting to be asked/told what to do. You were asking what was needed.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with that question. Even if I see 10 things that I could do, I might still ask what the person in charge (i.e., your mom) wanted me to do. They may have already told someone else to tackle a specific task; they may want x task done before y task. Or want z task done a certain way.\n\nI remember once (as a kid) I tried to be nice and move the laundry from the washer to the dryer. What I didn't know was that the curtain sheers that my mom washed needed to be lined dry. I still credit my mom for not getting mad at me. I know she spent hours trying to iron out the wrinkles that the sheers got from being in the dryer.\n\nI get that your mom was probably stressed at the time. I get that she would love for you to have \"just known\" what to do. But maybe gently remind her that you have to start somewhere. If she wants to encourage you to participate in family cleaning/chores, she should have welcomed that you cared enough to ask. If she really wanted to help you learn, she could have asked you if you could see anything that needed doing, then let you know (nicely) what tasks were open for you to tackle.\n\nIf you really want to do something nice for your mom, take a look in the kitchen after dinner and offer to put up the food or wash the dishes. This weekend ask if you can wash the bed sheets or clean the bathroom or dust or vacuum. I think your mom would be hard-pressed to complain about that!", "NTA. I'm 34, and I still always ask my mom what she wants me to do. She is extremely particular, and if I do something she wants to do herself, or if I don't do something to her standard, she will get upset and do it again herself anyway. I see nothing wrong with asking, and frankly, your mom could have just been a damned adult and told you what needed to be done instead of throwing a hissy fit.", "No you are NTA\nYour mom was wrong and you were just being polite", "Gotta go with NTA here.\n\nNot saying this is the case in this situation, but this is a question I have asked many times before. I have recently learned how to phrase it differently with much better results: \u201cHey, I can see thhat x, y, and z need to be done. There are probably other things that I am missing. What should I prioritize in order to be the most help?\u201d", "NTA", "NTA. I would dig deeper into why your mom thought she could treat you in this manner.", "NTA - you asked you don\u2019t know what\u2019s been done or that the plan is. If I got spoken to like that I would likely walk away and let them do the work. Respect goes both ways.", "NTA. I get it. My mom is like this too. If something needs to be cleaned she expects you to just know that. She never understood that I need to be given a specific task if she wants me to do something.", "Trust me, NTA. I fucking hate people who expect you to be a mind reader and then get angry when you can\u2019t read their minds.\n\nWhen people ask stuff like this around me(thankfully it\u2019s not my family), I usually end up doing what I think is correct and then I STILL disappoint them. You have no control over this situation. Talk to your family and explain to them that you can\u2019t read their minds!", "NTA. You asked and she refused to tell you and then got mad when you asked again. \n\nYou should probably have a bigger conversation with your mom about this though. Because I am sure there are ways you can be helpful without her fully having to spell things out and without you having to guess every time what needs to be done.", "NAH, sounds like a wholesome question to me. Keep the love for your mom flowing!", "NTA\n\nThe mom saying \"you have eyes\" instead of just telling you what to do is downright abusive behavior and absolutely terrible Communication. i don't care how obvious to you it may seem that the carpet needs vaccum cleaning, if you don't use your mouth, the one thing we were given to communicate and express what we want, then don't expect me to actually realise what you want.\n\n\nAnd as for the people saying that at 17 you should know what to do: its not that simple.\n\n\nFirst of all: The existence of neurodivergent people and how their brains work is probably going to blow your mind. All I will say is: having to be explicitly told what to do isn't a sign of stupidity or ignorance or anything else along those lines, claiming otherwise is like saying people in a wheelchair just don't have enough IQ to stand up and walk.\n\n\n\nSecond of all: Even if OP really should already know what to do, then the problem is still on the moms side for not being good enough of a parent to teach OP when to do those things.\n\n\nBesides: Its not like OP doesn't know HOW to do those things, if that were the case, then we'd really have a problem. But not knowing when to do them without being asked to? Perfectly reasonable in my opinion.", "NTA, if you have eyes, she also has a mouth. I disagree with everyone saying \"oh it's the mental load a girl wouldn't need to be told.\" Ok what am I then, a vegetable? Fact is, unless you've been conditioned from a young age to do housework, and the house isn't filthy (rug needing a vacuum doesn't fall into that category), most people simply wouldn't notice or care.\n\nYour mom is likely stressed from hosting, that does not mean she should go nuclear over a simple question, especially since she's the one who raised you this way", "NTA. I think cleaning and being aware of what needs to be cleaned is a skill. That's a skill that men don't often get taught, unfortunately. It's kinda crappy that your mom yelled at you, but I also understand her reasoning, just given that she assumes you can intuit what to do, because she can and she's clearly already stressed out. That said, if nobody at any point has shown you how to do any of these chores, or what to look for in getting them done, then obviously you're not going to know what to do.\n\nIf I were you, I'd talk to your mom afterwards and explain that you really don't see this stuff and that you could use a little hand holding to get started in being more helpful in chores around the house so this kind of problem doesn't come up again. If she reacts negatively, I'd look up tutorials on YouTube for how to get things done around the house and just do your best going forward.", "NTA", "NTAH", "NTA. I'm making an assumption, which may be unwise, that the sisters learned over many years how to do the chores they are now adept at doing, but OP did not learn. No one is born knowing what to do or intuits it. Maybe mom taught the sisters but didn't teach OP; maybe mom tried to teach OP but OP didn't catch on for whatever reason.\n\nHowever, even if one can see that vacuuming needs to be done and trash needs to be taken out, it is still reasonable to ask what needs to be done. The organizer (mom) may have other tasks that have priority. Unless you've worked as a team before and are in sync, it's best to ask what the team leader (mom) wants done first. She shouldn't have snapped at OP.", "NTA", "NTA. you didn't know what you could do to help out, so you asked. I think especially if you're trying to help and especially if you don't do a lot of cleaning, it's really hard to know where to start and to know you're not doing it wrong or making it worse, especially since cleaning does have a lot of personal preference.\n\nyou didn't know, so you asked, and for one reason or another it was the wrong time and your mom flipped out. I think the most heinous crime here committed is asking again when she seemed pissed the first time, but what else were you going to do? not clean up after you offered?", "NTA for asking what your mom wanted help with. When I'm throwing a party, I have a plan in my head and if someone just came in and started doing stuff without communicating with me, I might get upset.\n\nBut I feel like there is some missing context here. Had the plan already been discussed and you didn't pay attention? Has this similar situation occurred before. Had you already been asked to vacuum? Why would your mom assume you should know this information?\n\nHosting a party is stressful. Telling your mom that you don't like her tone and walking out without helping at all makes YTA. Next time help and then discuss afterwards how you felt to avoid the situation next time.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA and I\u2019ll tell you why, sometimes things don\u2019t come naturally to everyone, and that needs to be understood, all she needed to do was say it and instead she chose to get worked up and yell. It doesn\u2019t feel good.", "I genuinely don't understand all of these Y T A comments. You asked a simple question, trying to be helpful, and it could have been met with a better approach than getting mad at you over it.. NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. You can't be called an asshole for asking for instructions to help. This would've been much simpler if she told you what to do rather than exploding. Simple problems only require simple solutions.", "NTA but half and half, I don't know why is so hard for people to just comunicate instead of wanting everyone to just know, I do think that your sisters know what has to be done because they have done it more, tho that might be ur mums fault, parents tend to put more of the household duties toward the women in the house, that explains why ur sisters have the experience to just do stuff while u don't, it's good that you want to help, try with things u know ur mom don't like first and then with thing that just need to be done, if ur mom really cares about the dishes being clean, clean them, and then see what are other things you can do to keep the house more clean: vacuuming, dusting, throwing out the trash, cleaning the kitchen, organizing the bathroom, cleaning windows, just thing of what can be done and what is appropriate to be done, in this situation u wouldn't clean the bathroom, cuz I'm assuming guest would come soon, but in a normal weekend it's a good thing to do, or maybe the day before the house is gonna have a visit", "I\u2019m sorry NTA. You\u2019re being thoughtful and considerate. You asked to help and no one could be bothered to direct you to what they wanted done?", "I'm sorry but how the fuck is OP TA...? He was genuinely trying to help. Y'all need to have more empathy.\n\nI think people who said Y T A never had parents who didn't teach them household chores properly. Well, I had and I know how much it sucks. I had to learn everything on my own once I moved out and it was so frustrating and humiliating. I was always trying my best but there were moments when I genuinely didn't know how to do something / what needed to be done. It fucking sucks when everyone else around you seems to know everything perfectly and you're just standing there, wanting to help, but unsure of what to do, and too afraid to ask because you're acutely aware that you're supposed to know this already.\n\nIf OP had a similar upbringing, it's no wonder he wanted some instructions on what to do (especially because they were getting ready to host a party, not just day-to-day cleaning, AND he's only 17 and he hasn't lived on his own before). If anyone is TA, it's the parents for not teaching him how to do chores. But honestly, even if they had, I don't get how asking what needed to be done at the moment is such a bad thing. I would do the same if I hosted a party with my parents.\n\nNobody is a mind reader, how was OP supposed to know what his mom wanted him to do first? How was he supposed to know she wasn't planning on taking out the trash herself or asked one of his sisters already to do the vacuuming?\n\nYeah, absolutely NTA.", "That\u2019s on his mum, not him.", "\"You've been coddled, therefore YTA\" wut? How does that work? If the mum never made him help her, how the hell is he supposed to know what needs doing? If no one actively points anything out to him, why should he be aware of available tasks?", "Incredibly harsh for a 17 year old. He never chose to be coddled and assuming he was based on one situation in which he couldn't mind read is a bit insulting. I've been in a similar scenario in the past hence I can relate to this. You talk about the father potentially being the one coddling him as if there's no way that the mother could've. He clearly had good intentions asking to help so how is he the asshole? It's pretty clear that his mother was a bit overwhelmed mentally and reacted because he didn't know what to do. Nobody is the asshole in this situation.", "Maybe OP is autistic. Not all of us can read minds; it\u2019s weird to me to assume exactly what someone wants you to do. You don\u2019t consider any other possibilities besides chores\u2026 really?", "Exactly, I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s the mental load things are all about. Op wants to help, tell him what to do, simple as that.", "I\u2019m glad someone pointed out the consequences here\u2026 never asking or trying to help when mom is around", "I think a good solution would be \u201cnot right now, but can you help after the guests leave?\u201d\n\nWhich delays it to a less stressful time when the mother or sisters can train OP up.", "OP did precisely that. Including this post *he asked four fucking times*. How is that not adult behavior? And then people here give him the same response he got on iteration number 2 and 3.\n\nSo out of 4 requests for guidance he's basically gotten 1 dismissal and 3 punishments for incorrect social behavior. The lesson learnt by OP: \"Don't request guidance. Fuck other people. Let em suffer and mind your own business\". \n\nNTA. Case closed.", "I bet you wouldn't think it was weird if a 70 year old mother told their 50 year old daughter that she \"Doesn't like her tone\". \n\nHint: The mother wouldn't be in charge/have authority in that situation either.", "THis. \n\nI highly suspect that this is Reddit being sexist though; a lot of comments I'm seeing mention something about OP being male.", ">If I was a parent and my nearly adult son came to me   \n>  \n>while I\u2019m busy cooking  \n>  \n> to ask how he can help, and after he took the time to \u201clook\u201d around the house and   \n>  \n>still  \n>  \n> couldn\u2019t figure out what could possibly be done to get the house ready for company, I\u2019d explode too.\n\nWell, then you're a bad parent to. \n\nHow hard is it to say \"vacuum the carpets\"? Why send an untrained person out to figure stuff out - I mean, what if he is an idiot that needs to be told what to do? \n\nThen we shouldn't tell them what to do but yell at them? Great parenting.", "A search like that does not return any good results anyway. The top result on google is a guide that wants you to start preparing 3 weeks before the guests arrive and makes things like \"wiping down the walls\" or \"check outdoor lighting\" part of the process.\n\n\nNow I am not an expert in those kinds of things, but I doubt OP had whole 3 weeks to prepare, or had to check the outdoor lighting or wipe down the walls, in fact: had OP done just that, then the moms reaction probably would have been justified, though then the reaction would be more of a \"what the f**k are you doing\".\n\n\n\nAlso: does this guy not realise each household and each family has their own preferences and different things that need to be done around the house? There is a reason they don't make extensive, or often even just useful, guides on how to clean your house in a way that satisfies your mom because its not that simple. \n\n\nFor some families and some people, just vaccum cleaning once a week is already a lot, for others: wiping down the falls and checking your outdoor lighting every day might be essential to their survival."]}
