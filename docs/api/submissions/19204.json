A huge part of housework is the mental load. Remembering where is what. Remembering what products are running out. Keeping track of what's in the fridge and when it will go off and needs to be eaten or thrown away. Stuff like that. A LOT of it. You have lived your life cluelessly while someone else was doing all this in the background. If you were aware of all the work that is being done in a household you wouldn't need to ask what you can help with. I'm not saying you are an AH because I understand you have very different priorities in life that chores, especially at your age. But I can see that your mom got annoyed.

Then be ready to do the work.  Be ready and open to learning.  It is our job as mothers to teach our children how to be independent and one of those skills is cleaning/house prep.  My mom never taught me how to clean and always said \u2018you have eyes\u2019 but that left me second guessing and feeling overwhelmed, not knowing where to start.  My kids are still quite young but I\u2019ve been teaching them already.

Taking out trash, vacuuming, doing dishes, sweep the yard? \n\nInstead, you walked around the house and couldn't find anything to do? Seriously? Is this the first party your mom has ever hosted?\n\nWhat are you going to do when you have your first apartment? Walk around, then call your mom and ask what you should do?", "NTA. You were just trying to be helpful and IMO your moms reaction was over the top for just asking a question.

Is it a shared thing with your sisters, or does your mom typically do everything?

People who communicate like your mom are AHs.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA.\n\nMy family was like this, my mum never told me what she needed to be done and just did it herself when I hadn't done it. I, just like OP, cannot read our mother's minds. \n\nIt only changed when I had a long talk with my mum and told her to write a list down of stuff that needs to be done, when one is done to cross it off the list so that we don't need to to keep asking what needs to be done and just do it.

This is the best solution imo", "YTA. You are 17, not 5. If you were used to help your mom it should have been evident what needed to be done.", "NTA. Sometimes adults expect younger people to think the same. Maybe you never hosted a gathering and that\u2019s why you asked for instruction? Maybe mom was so caught up and stressed with planning? Sisters siding with mom is not surprising since mom is the only parent at home. Use this as a learning experience when helping others or when to offer help.", "Jfc is everyone a mind reader?\n\nIf you ask \"what can i do to help\" and are told \"you have eyes\", that is not a complete answer.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nAs the mom of teens, though, I can tell you it's extremely frustrating to have to do all. the. things. Having to come up with an assignment for you is just another thing while she has a million party things to get ready.  She's probably stressed out and while asking to help seems kind (and it is), it would have been better for you to say, \"mom, would you like me to take the garbage out?\"\n\nHopefully she's not always like this and you just caught her at a bad moment.", "NTA. \n\nIf you were a little older and had been living on your own for a bit, I would probably answer differently, because I get why your mom sighed . . . she probably carries the weight of  not only a lot of the chores but the mental labour of organising your household, and it gets exhausting having to direct people all the time if you don't want to do everything yourself.\n\nBUT . . .\n\nAt 17, while you are still entirely capable of helping, you haven't been running a household and you're still learning about what that entails. It's not that you're not aware that vacuuming, emptying the trash, etc. are necessary things . . . but you're still young enough that it likely hasn't been necessary for you to pay much attention to it. She's your parent, and it's her job to teach you. You're not her adult spouse, you're her kid - and a good one who is actually trying to get involved and be helpful - and you still need some guidance to comprehend which tasks need to be done when. At 17 I was happy to vacuum for my mum, but I would never have noticed that something \"needed vacuuming\". That takes time and experience. I get that she's weary . . . boy do I ever . . . but this is the time to guide you so that in a year or two you won't need it anymore.", "I\u2019m shocked at all the YTA. Personally if someone says to me you know what has to be done I wouldn\u2019t know. Some people don\u2019t know what needs to be done and need explaining. \n\nFor me personally, I can do what is asked I just need them to clarify what it is they\u2019re asking.

No way could I had worked out what needs doing.\n\nProbably going to sound weird, but this is a skill that needs cultivating and it is way more important than it could possibly feel like it is right now.

In the future it will translate to everywhere you live and every place you work.\n\nDoesn't really matter who the AH is, honestly this is standard Mum and 17yo Son stuff.\n\nPro tip: offer to help with cooking. You'll be very glad about that decision one day.", "NTA clearly she has spent enough time teaching you how to be an adult and that\u2019s on her not you.  Your heart was in the right place.", "ESH. At 17 you should be able to spot things that could be done. At the same time you\u2019re willing to help and asked; reasonably your mom could have had priorities about what needed to be done. She over reacted in my view. You also could have done one thing when she sent you off to look before coming back. Seems like crappy communication all the way round.", "NAH, but I can totally see where your mom is coming from. Household chores can be gendered with women having to manage and take care of most of them. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s feeling overwhelmed because of this.

That\u2019s not gutsy, that\u2019s just dumb.", "NAH. Bruh I'm mad stupid when it comes to chores and stuff so I totally get you and I get that you can be confused about what needs to be done. That being said your mom is already super stressed out by the preparations and you asking over and over again is stressing her out more. She kinda just lashed out because you were nearby is all, don't judge her too harshly for it.", "ESH\n\nYou asked a genuine question because you either couldn't tell what she wanted done or you were unsure of what she would and wouldn't want you to do. Now it is likely you should be able to pick up on what needs to be done by now. You should be able to spot and do these things on your own. Not seeing that in the moment doesn't make you TA. Asking for clarification doesn't make you one either, but it did likely stress her out. She shouldn't have lashed out at you like that. \n\nDid you respectfully let her know how you felt about her reaction? So long as you weren't rude I believe children, especially near adult children, should be able to openly communicate with their parents. Arguing and telling then how they should parent is a completely different story. It sounds like your family has a habit of talking down to you. No one should be dumped on. I'm sorry. I'm a parent who believes in apologizing to my children if I lose my cool. I can respect my kids enough to know when they don't deserve what I gave them. \n\nI think you're ok in general, but maybe need to stand up for yourself more respectfully. Just work a little on making sure you have all the needed life skills to make it outside of your parents' house and contribute inside it as well.", "Sounds like a no win situation.  Pretty sure even if you had found some chore to occupy yourself with, she would have been mad that it wasn't the task that was an obvious priority to her.", "NAH\n\nIt was harsh but at 17 shouldn\u2019t you know how to help?\n\nWe\u2019re your sisters told to help?", "Nta\n\nYou're young, it's their job to teach you to find what has to be done \n\nMostly if you have ADHD\n\nI mean unless it was fucking obvious like clothes in the middle of the rooms", "NTA apparently no one had the decency to teach to clean too and now your parent is blaming you instead of finally teaching you I think it's just a stupid reaction from your mom when you were actually trying to help and were willing to be taught", "NTA\n\nWhen you are looking at a situation, take a deep breath, look for things you can do, don\u2019t wait for someone to tell you exactly what to do. \n\nRemember some of the chores you have been assigned before, check them out. \n\nIt\u2019s not fair that kids get micro management all through childhood, then get yelled at for waiting to be\u2026micromanaged.\n\nAlso get checked for anxiety, based on this situation it would be weird if your parents didn\u2019t give you anxiety", "NAH. Apparently your mom didn't teach you the difference between a clean and a dirty house, so it might not be your fault that you didn't see what needs to be done. I hope you can catch up on that knowledge before you have to take care of your own home.\n\nAt the same time, your mother has better things to do than to teach you right before she expects guests, so it's no wonder she got angry that you kept bothering her.

Talk with her again when you both calmed down.", "Soft YTA. The same things need to be done to keep a house up, on rotation, basically always.
