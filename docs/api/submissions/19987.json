I paid in cash. At the end of the year like 2 weeks before the last day they announced that the yearbook was canceled. They said they would refund us during homeroom. I waited and waited until a week was left. I was fed up atp and went to the yearbook teacher to ask what was going on. He said that there should\u2019ve been a link sent to our homeroom teacher but we never got it, I even asked my other friends that bought the yearbook and were in different home rooms than me to see if they got the link, no one had gotten it. The yearbook teacher told us to write down our emails and he\u2019ll send the link. I didn\u2019t get it, I told him and he said to wait till tomorrow if I still don\u2019t get it then come back. I come back the next day with no email received. He told me to do the form on his laptop, I did. It asked for our address so I thought (maybe they will mail it to us) and I asked him he said he wasn\u2019t sure. I thought I would\u2019ve gotten it before school ended but no. So I was like, I\u2019ll wait during summer\u2026 it has been 3 weeks since summer break started and I still haven\u2019t received a check. (I think if you paid In cash they refund you with a check which doesn\u2019t make since now that I look back at it) The yearbook teacher is also leaving this year so I don\u2019t know if this was a scam or whatever because even the friends around me that bought a yearbook still haven\u2019t received a refund. I\u2019m pretty pissed cause I had to pay for the yearbook out of my own pocket and being a broke teenager it was quite expensive to me. I\u2019m thinking of going to my school to ask about it since they currently are still open cause of summer school. But i don\u2019t know if I would be considered the asshoe if I do. (There was 2 rumors on why the yearbook was canceled btw; 1. Someone in the club went in the system and deleted all the photos, which if this is the reason that is the teachers fault for giving students complete access and not even having a backup saved. This was also how the yearbook club memebers said happened. 2. The company that the club ordered from bailed on them, which again wouldn\u2019t make sense cause they were long done with the yearbook why haven\u2019t they ordered them? )", "created_utc": 1687103226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cnn2m/aita_for_going_to_my_school_and_demanding_a/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
