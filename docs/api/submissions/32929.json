It was held at me and my boyfriend's new house, the first family event we've had here. My boyfriend really wanted to take part in the gift giving so went all out with gifts, spending an average of 100 dollars per person. He was so excited to give everyone their presents since we spent not only money but also a lot of time picking everything for everyone.\n\nThe festivities were a hit and my boyfriend and I stepped away for a bit to have some quiet time together, while we were resting on the stairs, we overheard my cousin [17F] chatting with my niece [15F], they were joking around about a few family members and mentioned my boyfriend and how he was \"too gay to function\". Honestly we didn't mind it too much, it's a movie reference and they're kids, but then another cousin [24M] came in and began making harsher jokes, which the kids laughed at. These \"jokes\" brought my boyfriend to tears and I refused to let that slide.\n\nWhen the gift trading began, I took the three aside and let them know that I wasn't happy with their comments and that they weren't ok to say. I told them to apologise to my boyfriend because it was unfair to him and they refused because they were just jokes that we weren't meant to hear. I told them I didn't care and they had to apologise. They refused again and I told them that since they don't respect him they don't deserve the presents we got for them. This got them to backtrack and say they'd apologise but I told them it was too late but they should still apologise. This is where I think I might have been too harsh.\n\nThe youngest of my cousin's told her mum, my aunt, that I was refusing to give her and the other two their presents and she was angry about it, she told the parents of my niece and the male cousin's dad and partner about it and all of them made a huge fuss. Me and my sister kicked them out and when they tried to grab their presents before leaving I stopped them and rushed them out the door. The whole thing fell apart after that and it all ended very abruptly.\n\nSo, aita for kicking them out and taking away their gifts over jokes?", "created_utc": 1702454772, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hbyly/aita_for_taking_away_my_familys_gifts_because_of/", "score": 1553, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's honestly even worse than \"I was just joking\"", "NTA, NTA, NTA \nHow are you gonna treat someone so bad at their function. Personally that would be recension of all future invites of those ones involved. The fact that they made it out to be a grab for the gifts is disgusting.  They didn't come for family they came to get free stuff and that level of toxic is never invited to our events.  I'd truly not buy them gifts again.

NTA.", "NTA\n\nThey tried to grab their presents on the way out?? Wtf???", "NTA, by your family's actions it sounds like their relationship with you is more centered on the transactional side of things. You and your SO were disrespected and insulted in your own house and the priority was the gifts? I don't think they want the same type of relationship with you as you do with them.", "NTA.  Oooooh the entitlement is strong with these folks. You were not disciplining her awful, stupid children, you were not giving them something that they were absolutely not entitled to.. These rude dumb kids were being completely disrespectful to you and your boyfriend in your own house. And where have they learnt this? OK, some is at school / internet, but it is reinforced at their homes. These people are nasty leeches. Stop the presents, just stop, all of them. See who still turns up at your house, see who still keeps in touch. Sorry OP, but your generosity has masked some deep homophobia, and you guys need a new balance.", "NTA. You bought the gifts. If you don\u2019t want to give them, then screw everyone else. But on a side note, you have a 15, 17 and 24 year old making jokes and refusing to apologise. I might get it if they were a little younger, like A LOT younger, but this was just childish and ridiculous of them.", "NTA there\u2019s no excuse for their behaviour and it\u2019s really sad they spoiled what could have been a lovely Christmas party. Completely justified taking the gifts away.", "NTA. What I want to say about your family will get me banned. I'm so sorry. I agree with all the previous comments. \n\nMerry Christmas to you and your BF. I'm glad you have each other.", "NTA\n\nThey were rude to their hosts, and were told what they said was hurtful.

I wouldn\u2019t have waited for the gift giving; I would have tossed the lot of them out on their asses as soon as I heard the first homophobic \u201cjoke\u201d come out of their mouths, and if they tried to say \u201cmake me\u201d, I would be on the phone with the police to have them hauled away.", "NO YOU\u2018RE NOT THE A!\n\nYour bf wanted to do something nice but those kids didn\u2019t deserve that gratitude, they didn\u2019t even want to apologize!

Next year don't bother to buy them presents and only invite the ones that do respect you.", "NTA, they're old enough to make homophobic remarks so hurtful that it brings someone to tears and then not apologise because \"it's just jokes\" (funny how many bullies say that when they're called out, isn't it?), then they're old enough to face the consequences. Your aunts and uncles should have brought their children up better", "NTA.. what does too gay to function even mean? It lacks of superior understanding that one should not even make a joke like that! nobody needs to hear this stuff. Hope you and bf are ok", "NTA. My teenager used gay as an insult or described a game he didn\u2019t like as that and I asked him if he wanted to call his (gay) uncle (my brother) and let him know that gay is a great insult. He changed his tune pretty quickly. If any of my kids doubled down on mean spirited comments about someone\u2019s sexuality, race, gender and hurt the person they\u2019d lose all their damn gifts.\nThe stupid thing is my brother loves calling things he hates gay and uses the f-slur as an insult. If I hang out with him for too long I start to use gay as an insult as well. I think it\u2019s because of my autism tending to mask and mimic the people I\u2019m with. It makes me want to strangle him whenever I end up saying it.", "NTA now you know what they really think about your boyfriend and your relationship. You are good enough for great gifts but nothing more.\n\nIf I would be their parent I would be ashamed. But since the parents reacted to easy they did you also know where they stand. And that's not on your side.", "NTA the typical \"if someone feels offended say it was a joke\" attitude... good on you for doing it, and if.rst.of your family thinks its ok then they can go stuff themselves", "You didn\u2019t do it over jokes, you did it over disrespect. And they tried to grab the presents on the way out? I think you need to rethink the gift giving next year. Keep it to those who are little kids.", "NTA You were disrespected in your own house and perfectly entitled to point it out. You gave these children a reasonable opportunity to redeem themselves and they refused it. Of course you withdrew your gifts, they had destroyed whatever generosity you might have felt for them! \n\nI do not understand the adults\u2019 responses here, except your sister\u2019s. It seems the gift-giving ritual has lost its meaning entirely for them, becoming simply a deserved experience as opposed to an earned experience. Good for you, restoring its significance! \n\nDo please get out ahead of this with your family: let everyone know your disappointment and regret that your inaugural event in your new home was ruined by such adolescent behaviour (not admitting fault and apologising for offence) and your concern at the homophobic comments, which warrant addressing by both the children and their parents. Stand over your reaction. Establish that boundary now, around your relationship and your space. Then the next step is up to them. Hopefully that\u2019s a fulsome apology and a life-lesson well learned.", "NTA\n\nThat's horrible. I hope you guys are okay.", "NTA....  they got caught out, they just needed to bite the bullet and give a quick probably not even meant apology .. they wouldnt..  they got no presents... they brought it on themselves", "NTA. They disrespected your boyfriend big time. No presents for little jerks.", "NTA. And I can guarantee this is not the first time they make fun of you if they found it so easy to do.", "NTA in any shape or form. They are not your kids, no, and you are not disciplining them.

They don't deserve disrespect if they are sitting on a park bench any more than they do in their home. \n\nI think a better thing to say is:  \n\n\"Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.  You should always watch what you say because you never know who is listening, and you could hurt people with your words.  You are all old enough to know better than to treat people like this.  There are consequences for treating people poorly, as you can see.\"", "I don't know about you, but my dad would have whooped my ass if I acted like those kids.", "None of them are. Even the youngest at 15 is old enough to know better. I hope op donates the gifts to people who really need them and will appreciate them.", "That appalled me. That one is a lost cause and hopefully gets shunned by OP.", "I think he just didn\u2019t give gifts to the ones involved.  However, if anyone doesn\u2019t have the OP\u2019s back on this decision, I also wouldn\u2019t be giving them gifts.  \n\nFWIW: I personally think it is ok to not give gifts at all, for any reason as they should be given from the heart and the recipient should be grateful.  Gift giving can pull families apart, I have friends who purposely have distanced themselves from family rather than have to contend with the expectations at Christmas.  It should never be an obligation, and everyone should understand that.", "Yeah, like, good on the sister there for being a decent person when all the other ostensible adults were not. I'm glad that OP has at least some good family members to rely on, especially if this becomes *a thing* for the extended relatives.", "In this case, the offending parties WERE smart enough to leave.  If they\u2019d been dumb enough to say \u201cmake me\u201d and refuse to leave, then it would\u2019ve become a trespassing issue and OP and his partner would have every right to call the cops on them.", "Even within the context of the movie I never understood what this joke meant.", "If you are going to be ~~in someone elses home and become~~ disrespectful, then you deserve the consequences OP handed out.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you are, don't treat other people unkindly or with disrespect.", "It'll just check the vote of the top comment, it doesn't tally/score.", "Don't worry about what he says.

Don't worry about it.\n\nHowever, if you want to be completely correct in the future, try taking out each side of the conjunction and saying the sentence. So instead of \"My boyfriend and I's place\" it would be \"My boyfriend's place\" and \"I's place\"...which immediately shows you that the second one is technically incorrect and should be \"My boyfriend and my place.\" \n\nAnd yes, that sounds weird as crap which is why even native English speakers don't usually say it that way...but it is technically the grammatically-correct way to say it.

If I had ever been so rude to my relatives they wouldn\u2019t need to take the presents from me, my parents would have done that themselves and order me to apologize with a hand written letter that my mom would proof read to make sure it was genuine.

People get sent to jail when their brain hasn't fully developed, consequences still happen. It's not a get out of jail free card or an excuse to be awful.", "If you bully someone in school, you get punished.  So apparently regardless of the brain\u2019s development, society and the government says that it is not Ok to bully someone.  Further more, regardless of whether or not the brain is fully developed, research shows that children often have the ability to know right from wrong by age 2, and definitely know the difference between right from wrong by age 14.  So in your mind, it is ok for these \u201ckids\u201d to bully a family member at home, and they should not be punished, even though they could get detention or possibly even expelled at school for the exact same thing.  Fuck nah.  The kids brains may not be fully developed, but it\u2019s obvious from your comments that they are not the only ones!", "Then why do schools punish kids for misbehaving if their brains aren't fully developed?

Kids do dumb crap and say insensitive things\u2014they\u2019re kids after all\u2014but decent parents WANT to hold them accountable for that!", "Where's that from?", ">regardless of whether or not the brain is fully developed\n\nIt turns out this claim that 'brains are not fully developed until the age of 25' is debatable at best anyway. There is a grain of truth in it - thats all. Any such generalization about something as complex as the human brain is, almost by definition, so oversimplified as to be meaningless.
