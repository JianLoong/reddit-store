It was held at me and my boyfriend's new house, the first family event we've had here. My boyfriend really wanted to take part in the gift giving so went all out with gifts, spending an average of 100 dollars per person. He was so excited to give everyone their presents since we spent not only money but also a lot of time picking everything for everyone.\n\nThe festivities were a hit and my boyfriend and I stepped away for a bit to have some quiet time together, while we were resting on the stairs, we overheard my cousin [17F] chatting with my niece [15F], they were joking around about a few family members and mentioned my boyfriend and how he was \"too gay to function\". Honestly we didn't mind it too much, it's a movie reference and they're kids, but then another cousin [24M] came in and began making harsher jokes, which the kids laughed at. These \"jokes\" brought my boyfriend to tears and I refused to let that slide.\n\nWhen the gift trading began, I took the three aside and let them know that I wasn't happy with their comments and that they weren't ok to say. I told them to apologise to my boyfriend because it was unfair to him and they refused because they were just jokes that we weren't meant to hear. I told them I didn't care and they had to apologise. They refused again and I told them that since they don't respect him they don't deserve the presents we got for them. This got them to backtrack and say they'd apologise but I told them it was too late but they should still apologise. This is where I think I might have been too harsh.\n\nThe youngest of my cousin's told her mum, my aunt, that I was refusing to give her and the other two their presents and she was angry about it, she told the parents of my niece and the male cousin's dad and partner about it and all of them made a huge fuss. Me and my sister kicked them out and when they tried to grab their presents before leaving I stopped them and rushed them out the door. The whole thing fell apart after that and it all ended very abruptly.\n\nSo, aita for kicking them out and taking away their gifts over jokes?", "created_utc": 1702454772, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hbyly/aita_for_taking_away_my_familys_gifts_because_of/", "score": 6589, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Personally that would be recension of all future invites of those ones involved. The fact that they made it out to be a grab for the gifts is disgusting.  They didn't come for family they came to get free stuff and that level of toxic is never invited to our events.  I'd truly not buy them gifts again.

Wtf???", "NTA, by your family's actions it sounds like their relationship with you is more centered on the transactional side of things. You and your SO were disrespected and insulted in your own house and the priority was the gifts? I don't think they want the same type of relationship with you as you do with them.", "NTA.  Oooooh the entitlement is strong with these folks. You were not disciplining her awful, stupid children, you were not giving them something that they were absolutely not entitled to.. These rude dumb kids were being completely disrespectful to you and your boyfriend in your own house. And where have they learnt this? OK, some is at school / internet, but it is reinforced at their homes. These people are nasty leeches. Stop the presents, just stop, all of them. See who still turns up at your house, see who still keeps in touch. Sorry OP, but your generosity has masked some deep homophobia, and you guys need a new balance.", "NTA. You bought the gifts. If you don\u2019t want to give them, then screw everyone else. But on a side note, you have a 15, 17 and 24 year old making jokes and refusing to apologise. I might get it if they were a little younger, like A LOT younger, but this was just childish and ridiculous of them.", "NTA there\u2019s no excuse for their behaviour and it\u2019s really sad they spoiled what could have been a lovely Christmas party. Completely justified taking the gifts away.", "NTA. What I want to say about your family will get me banned. I'm so sorry. I agree with all the previous comments. \n\nMerry Christmas to you and your BF. I'm glad you have each other.", "NTA\n\nThey were rude to their hosts, and were told what they said was hurtful.

Next year don't bother to buy them presents and only invite the ones that do respect you.", "NTA, they're old enough to make homophobic remarks so hurtful that it brings someone to tears and then not apologise because \"it's just jokes\" (funny how many bullies say that when they're called out, isn't it?), then they're old enough to face the consequences. Your aunts and uncles should have brought their children up better", "NTA.. what does too gay to function even mean? It lacks of superior understanding that one should not even make a joke like that! nobody needs to hear this stuff. Hope you and bf are ok", "NTA. My teenager used gay as an insult or described a game he didn\u2019t like as that and I asked him if he wanted to call his (gay) uncle (my brother) and let him know that gay is a great insult. He changed his tune pretty quickly. If any of my kids doubled down on mean spirited comments about someone\u2019s sexuality, race, gender and hurt the person they\u2019d lose all their damn gifts.\nThe stupid thing is my brother loves calling things he hates gay and uses the f-slur as an insult. If I hang out with him for too long I start to use gay as an insult as well. I think it\u2019s because of my autism tending to mask and mimic the people I\u2019m with. It makes me want to strangle him whenever I end up saying it.", "NTA now you know what they really think about your boyfriend and your relationship. You are good enough for great gifts but nothing more.\n\nIf I would be their parent I would be ashamed. But since the parents reacted to easy they did you also know where they stand.

And they tried to grab the presents on the way out? I think you need to rethink the gift giving next year. Keep it to those who are little kids.", "NTA You were disrespected in your own house and perfectly entitled to point it out. You gave these children a reasonable opportunity to redeem themselves and they refused it. Of course you withdrew your gifts, they had destroyed whatever generosity you might have felt for them! \n\nI do not understand the adults\u2019 responses here, except your sister\u2019s. It seems the gift-giving ritual has lost its meaning entirely for them, becoming simply a deserved experience as opposed to an earned experience. Good for you, restoring its significance! \n\nDo please get out ahead of this with your family: let everyone know your disappointment and regret that your inaugural event in your new home was ruined by such adolescent behaviour (not admitting fault and apologising for offence) and your concern at the homophobic comments, which warrant addressing by both the children and their parents. Stand over your reaction. Establish that boundary now, around your relationship and your space. Then the next step is up to them. Hopefully that\u2019s a fulsome apology and a life-lesson well learned.", "NTA\n\nThat's horrible. I hope you guys are okay.", "NTA....  they got caught out, they just needed to bite the bullet and give a quick probably not even meant apology .. they wouldnt..  they got no presents... they brought it on themselves", "NTA. They disrespected your boyfriend big time. No presents for little jerks.", "NTA. And I can guarantee this is not the first time they make fun of you if they found it so easy to do.", "NTA in any shape or form. They are not your kids, no, and you are not disciplining them.

(If you don\u2019t have a \u201cChristmas Store\u201d where you are, it\u2019s a giant \u201cstore\u201d thrown together - usually at a large church, school gym &/or even center of some kind with the space where whatever group sponsoring it sets up rows & rows of tables to create makeshift aisles - with every table covered in heaping piles of children\u2019s\u2019 clothes, household products & toys - all new & all free for anyone with a ticket to shop there.  When even contact the family who\u2019s being given a ticket to notify them, they even ask for the child\u2019s sizes & preferences for toys so that they can make sure that some of those items are available - so whichever parent shops will be sure to be able to find something specifically for their child & no parent leaves the Christmas\nStore with nothing for their child.)  \n\nI\u2019d NEVER have had the money for real holiday type food that first year or two, so getting a basket full of it was like getting an unexpected gift from Santa myself as an adult.  And I\u2019d NEVER have been able to give my son any really neat Christmas gifts, so getting an invitation to the Christmas Store was like winning the lottery.  \n\nBoth my babies are grown now with babies of their own.  I\u2019m a professional woman who can have whatever holiday food I want & give my children & grandchild almost anything they ask for without worrying about what it might cost.
