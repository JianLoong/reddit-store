I then decided that I didn't want to meet my parents on Saturday which worked out as one of my friends, Ray 17M, invited me to go watch a movie. I told my parents that I couldn't see them because I was busy but I told my social worker the truth and she understood.\n\nWhen I got back from the movie, my dad called me and told me that his brother had seen me at the cinema with my friend and he asked why I couldn't meet them.

He wants me to apologise for lying about why I couldn't see them.

And you didn\u2019t lie. You were indeed busy with a friend at the movies. Then relationship isn\u2019t entirely on your shoulders and if they want things to be better then they have to put in the work. One thing they could do is look the other way when they don\u2019t get their way. They chose to cause conflict.", "Absolutely NTA you are still only 15, it's not your job to make them feel better. You need to do whatever is best for you but in future I would tell them the truth that you are not up for a visit with them.", "NTA. You are the one who was ignored by them, your parents. But it looks like everyone's making you the adult and your parents get to be as selfish as they want.", "NTA.\n\nYou know what? Despite the fact that you are 15, you still have the right to emotional privacy. You don't owe the whole world the truth about how you feel all the time. It is actually okay to give little white lies as a reason for these kinds of things, especially if the actual truth will make you feel even worse than you do already. \n\nThe problem with the truth about your emotions is that you will encounter people who will second-guess your feelings and try to explain to you why you really don't feel that way.", "NTA - you were honest with the social worker and when you tried to explain to your father after-the-fact, he became accusatory and placed blame. That's a good place to start in your next therapy session. It's GREAT that you understand how important honesty is - you should be able to be honest in the safe-space of therapy. Crying in front of a therapist is no big deal - they expect it. And retreating from the work for a day to spend time with a friend is another form of self-care.", "NTA. Yes, you lied. That's not cool, but your parents are the ones that FU if you're no longer in their home. To complain that _you're_ not taking it seriously enough means they're not getting it. They're blaming you for the issues, instead of trying to understand why you would _want_ to avoid them. When my youngest began to avoid us, camping in their room, I asked why and what we could do to improve. I didn't blame my kid, I asked what we, as parents, could do to improve\u2014to make them feel safer and more open with us. Just by even saying the this, my kid felt an enormous relief and we were able to talk since there was no judgement. Your parents need to accept their responsibility, your agency, and be patient when it comes to healing.", "Former CPS worker here.  I am dismayed the SW didn't listen more to you. I am assuming you have an attorney or an advocate. I suggest letting them know how you are feeling, so your voice is heard. NTA. They can make sure the issue is addressed, and resolution is attempted prior to reunification. If a central issue is not addressed, the plan is shaky.", "NTA. If they can\u2019t see that they were hurtful and didn\u2019t give you space when you were upset then maybe you shouldn\u2019t move back in. They were and still are the problem and they need to be better for reunification to be an option", "Nope nope nope. You take care of yourself and your mental health. \ud83e\udd0d", "NTA\n\nTechnically, you didn\u2019t lie. You were busy with a friend. \n\nYour mental health in all of this is important.", "NTA. You didn't lie you had plans. You went to a movie with a friend. Therapy is great but it's not a magic quick fix. That takes time.", "NTA - I think your parents should \"try harder\" at building a relationship with you where you would be comfortable telling them how you feel.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t your responsibility to repair the relationship. You\u2019re the child. Also, your feelings are valid", "NTA - you told the therapist the real reason and were simply looking to avoid more unnecessary drama. The family dynamics sound bad. That you are all in therapy is a good thing and it may take some time. I\u2019d suggest addressing the reason you felt the need to lie in your next therapy session. To be honest I wouldn\u2019t apologize for it behind simply addressing the reason but follow your therapists guidance. The whole family needs to understand that EVERYONE needs to change and adjust their behavior for this to work and that it will be an ongoing struggle until new behaviors become the norm and not just a means to get you home. I wish you all good luck. Stick with the family therapy. Maybe suggest individual therapy for your parents also. Sounds like they may need some extra help in addressing their share of the issues.", "NTA And I\u2019m going to ask the question that no one seems to be asking you\u2026. Do you want to reunite with your parents or would you rather stay at the group home?  Your 15 and you should have loving parents and a loving home but you don\u2019t.  This means your going to have to grow up way too fast and make decisions about the question I just asked.  Think about that question and what YOU want.  When you have an answer, act according.  I wish you the best.", "I'm not going to judge here because clearly the state or someone felt it necessary to separate you from your parents until things could be worked out. You told your parents you were busy that day... you omitted you didn't want to spend time with them because of the last session. Perhaps next time let them know you need some space to get better perspective.", "NTA. You're young and working through some very big things by the sound of this post. You didn't lie to them, you were in fact, busy. You could have been busy resting, thinking, existing, whatever. If anything I think you should be proud you decided to put yourself first by giving yourself time to process the session, and avoiding a situation where emotions could have gotten heated.", "NTA- at all! \n\nAre you getting individual counseling aside from the family therapy? It\u2019s hard but you need it. Trust me when I tell you that it\u2019s better to go through and do the work now and not leave it until you\u2019re an adult. This is going to come up again and again until you handle it. \n\nTell your SW to get you into private therapy, too. \n\nI\u2019m a foster mom. EVERY kid we get goes to therapy, no exceptions.", "NTA: You weren\u2019t lying you were busy spending time on yourself after having an awful session in therapy. If they can\u2019t understand this then that is their problem and not yours. It\u2019s on them to put in the effort and for you to decide what you want to do. Don\u2019t let them bully you into anything.", "NTA they sound toxic and you sound happier where you are now. 3 years and you can go NC. Best of luck you deserve better!", "Without further context - NTA. They have a responsibility to you, to look out for your best interests and to nurture you. I don't know how or why you ended up in your current situation, but it's not incumbent on you to validate them. You did what you did to avoid conflict, you didn't lie (you had plans) but you didn't volunteer information. Well within your rights. Look after yourself and hopefully you find your happy place...", "TBH a judgement on this one is difficult, becuase we need a bit of a background on who the AH was post the drama\n\nNTA from what it seems like, though", "YTA! It's completely your choice to not see them. You don't need to excuse or justify yourself to them. You told the social worker, that's all you were required to do. A big part of therapy is also listening to the person in front of you and they're clearly not doing that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When they accuse you of not trying hard enough, please, remember that you are a child. Even if only technically. In no universe is the entire onus of this relationship on you.

Why is there so much onus on you to improve this relationship?", "Case manager here\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong and I'd honestly encourage you to be more open with your case worker and also the therapist about how your family is speaking to you. If possible, I'd also ask for a parent aid to be present during your visits so they can see first hand how you're treated, or only communicate with your parents through text", "NTA and tell your social worker about how he called you to try to manipulate and gaslight you.

Your father is trying to make you take the blame for the dysfunctional family dynamics, and refuses to admit that they even exit, and is basically calling you lazy/noncompliant in therapy?   Can you call the therapist on the phone and tell them about this?  I feel like the therapist is biased also.  \n\nHow would you feel about staying in foster care until you age out?  Not a great solution, but I don't think your parents are going to admit their bias.  If you do return to their home, remember it won't be that long.  \n\nWhy were you in foster care to begin with?  Neglect on the part of the parents?", "NTA. You didn't lie, you were busy going out with a friend.\n\nI've been in your position and it sucks. I'm sorry. Hang in there, in just a few years you will be an adult and won't have to see them anymore.", "NTA you were honest with your social worker and you took time away from a situation that is upsetting. You have a right to protect yourself mentally & emotionally and if by lying a little to do that imo it\u2019s ok. You are complying with therapy/family obligations and it\u2019s ok to need a break!!!

The attorney may also be known as a guardian ad litem in your state so I'd definitely request speaking to them", "Yes!!!  It sounds like the parents want the SW to \"fix\" OP.  They aren't doing the hard work of therapy.", "Also if your case manager still isn't listening to you or is encouraging things you don't feel comfortable with, you should absolutely request a new one or to speak with their supervisor. You can also ask the court for a victims advocate who can sit in on these meetings as well", "For some kids, foster care is awful and not worth it. For others, if they\u2019re in a good and stable home/situation, then foster care absolutely is better. Please talk with your social worker and therapist about it. You\u2019re definitely NTA here.

Seems parents want OP to do the work...", "If you got removed and they\u2019re trying to get you back, that means THEIR actions are most likely what caused your removal. It\u2019s not YOUR job to pull majority of the weight of reunification\u2026 THEY need to own up to their flaws or at least acknowledge that you feel they possess these flaws and recognize your feelings as valid. If THEY aren\u2019t doing their bit, then of course you\u2019re not going to want to spend more time with them. I\u2019d actually start implementing this whenever they act up and refuse to hear your side.", "NTA - Hopefully, as you continue therapy, you\u2019ll eventually feel empowered to be honest with everyone, including your parents, in situations like these. Nevertheless, it is 100% okay for you to need space from your parents (or anyone else) after you\u2019ve had an argument. It\u2019s normal. Adults do it all of the time. While lying to avoid hurting people\u2019s feelings isn\u2019t good, many people are not comfortable sharing negative feelings with others and may lie to avoid conflict. The blame in this case lies mostly on your parents\u2026.not you. They have not provided a safe environment for you to tell them that you are upset. Look at your dad\u2019s reaction to finding out you went to the movies. Instead of asking himself why you didn\u2019t want to see him and/or didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling him the truth, he\u2019s blaming you for the therapy not going the way he wants.", "NTA\nIt's normal to need time to process overwhelming feelings. It seems like your parents aren't hearing your hurt and feeling unsafe with them because of their poor parenting. THEY let YOU down. It's not your job to fix what they broke. Why should you trust them? They still care more about ending this inconvenient arrangement than how you came to be safer in foster care than in their home.", "NTA", "OMG, yes!!!", "I agree, youshould definitely address this in therapy. If you're worried you won't be able to get your thoughts out or won't be given a chance to explain your perspective, maybe write it out and hand it to the therapist at the beginning of the session.\n\nI am proud of you for recognizing what you need and standing up for yourself. It is obvious your parents don't realize (or want to realize) they have lost your trust along the way and need to build that back up. Hang in there!", "Sometimes the system works and this seems to be one of them. Foster life sucks when you are placed in abusive homes or families. You seems to be in a good group home. I wouldn't listen to other people that are not in you situation. Do you have group meets in your home? Maybe you can talk about it there. Sometimes the therapist and the advocate get a little too set on reunification, but they need to focus on what you, the child, wants and needs.", "Aside from that, what are the chances a buddy saw OP coincidentally at the cinema? Maybe if they\u2019re from a small town, but it\u2019s very bizarre that somehow they were able to pinpoint OP\u2019s whereabouts just about the same night.", "You know, I was wondering about that, too. Odd.", "Honestly, that is not the part that sounded weird as I have run into people I know states away.", "NTA", "NTA - You are a child and process things differently, he's the adult and should have more understanding that therapy can be 2 steps forward 3 steps back sometimes and give you the space you needed at that time. It says a lot that you feel you have to lie still to try and keep some peace! That is NOT your job your parents are the ones that should be trying to help you not the other way round.", "Also, the OP is the kid.  The kid shouldn\u2019t be the one trying hard to improve the relationship.  The kid should, at most, be open to the idea that the relationship might be able to be improved through work on the part of their parents."]}
