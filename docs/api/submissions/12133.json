And you didn\u2019t lie. You were indeed busy with a friend at the movies. Then relationship isn\u2019t entirely on your shoulders and if they want things to be better then they have to put in the work. One thing they could do is look the other way when they don\u2019t get their way. They chose to cause conflict.", "Absolutely NTA you are still only 15, it's not your job to make them feel better. You need to do whatever is best for you but in future I would tell them the truth that you are not up for a visit with them.", "NTA. You are the one who was ignored by them, your parents. But it looks like everyone's making you the adult and your parents get to be as selfish as they want.", "NTA.\n\nYou know what? Despite the fact that you are 15, you still have the right to emotional privacy. You don't owe the whole world the truth about how you feel all the time. It is actually okay to give little white lies as a reason for these kinds of things, especially if the actual truth will make you feel even worse than you do already. \n\nThe problem with the truth about your emotions is that you will encounter people who will second-guess your feelings and try to explain to you why you really don't feel that way.", "NTA - you were honest with the social worker and when you tried to explain to your father after-the-fact, he became accusatory and placed blame. That's a good place to start in your next therapy session. It's GREAT that you understand how important honesty is - you should be able to be honest in the safe-space of therapy. Crying in front of a therapist is no big deal - they expect it. And retreating from the work for a day to spend time with a friend is another form of self-care.", "NTA. Yes, you lied. That's not cool, but your parents are the ones that FU if you're no longer in their home. To complain that _you're_ not taking it seriously enough means they're not getting it. They're blaming you for the issues, instead of trying to understand why you would _want_ to avoid them. When my youngest began to avoid us, camping in their room, I asked why and what we could do to improve. I didn't blame my kid, I asked what we, as parents, could do to improve\u2014to make them feel safer and more open with us. Just by even saying the this, my kid felt an enormous relief and we were able to talk since there was no judgement. Your parents need to accept their responsibility, your agency, and be patient when it comes to healing.", "Former CPS worker here.  I am dismayed the SW didn't listen more to you. I am assuming you have an attorney or an advocate. I suggest letting them know how you are feeling, so your voice is heard. NTA. They can make sure the issue is addressed, and resolution is attempted prior to reunification. If a central issue is not addressed, the plan is shaky.", "NTA. If they can\u2019t see that they were hurtful and didn\u2019t give you space when you were upset then maybe you shouldn\u2019t move back in. They were and still are the problem and they need to be better for reunification to be an option", "Nope nope nope. You take care of yourself and your mental health. \ud83e\udd0d", "NTA\n\nTechnically, you didn\u2019t lie. You were busy with a friend. \n\nYour mental health in all of this is important.", "NTA. You didn't lie you had plans. You went to a movie with a friend. Therapy is great but it's not a magic quick fix. That takes time.", "NTA - I think your parents should \"try harder\" at building a relationship with you where you would be comfortable telling them how you feel.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t your responsibility to repair the relationship. You\u2019re the child. Also, your feelings are valid", "NTA - you told the therapist the real reason and were simply looking to avoid more unnecessary drama. The family dynamics sound bad. That you are all in therapy is a good thing and it may take some time. I\u2019d suggest addressing the reason you felt the need to lie in your next therapy session. To be honest I wouldn\u2019t apologize for it behind simply addressing the reason but follow your therapists guidance. The whole family needs to understand that EVERYONE needs to change and adjust their behavior for this to work and that it will be an ongoing struggle until new behaviors become the norm and not just a means to get you home. I wish you all good luck. Stick with the family therapy. Maybe suggest individual therapy for your parents also. Sounds like they may need some extra help in addressing their share of the issues.", "NTA And I\u2019m going to ask the question that no one seems to be asking you\u2026. Do you want to reunite with your parents or would you rather stay at the group home?  Your 15 and you should have loving parents and a loving home but you don\u2019t.  This means your going to have to grow up way too fast and make decisions about the question I just asked.  Think about that question and what YOU want.  When you have an answer, act according.  I wish you the best.", "I'm not going to judge here because clearly the state or someone felt it necessary to separate you from your parents until things could be worked out. You told your parents you were busy that day... you omitted you didn't want to spend time with them because of the last session. Perhaps next time let them know you need some space to get better perspective.", "NTA. You're young and working through some very big things by the sound of this post. You didn't lie to them, you were in fact, busy. You could have been busy resting, thinking, existing, whatever. If anything I think you should be proud you decided to put yourself first by giving yourself time to process the session, and avoiding a situation where emotions could have gotten heated.", "NTA- at all! \n\nAre you getting individual counseling aside from the family therapy? It\u2019s hard but you need it. Trust me when I tell you that it\u2019s better to go through and do the work now and not leave it until you\u2019re an adult. This is going to come up again and again until you handle it. \n\nTell your SW to get you into private therapy, too. \n\nI\u2019m a foster mom. EVERY kid we get goes to therapy, no exceptions.", "NTA: You weren\u2019t lying you were busy spending time on yourself after having an awful session in therapy. If they can\u2019t understand this then that is their problem and not yours. It\u2019s on them to put in the effort and for you to decide what you want to do. Don\u2019t let them bully you into anything.", "NTA they sound toxic and you sound happier where you are now. 3 years and you can go NC. Best of luck you deserve better!", "Without further context - NTA. They have a responsibility to you, to look out for your best interests and to nurture you. I don't know how or why you ended up in your current situation, but it's not incumbent on you to validate them. You did what you did to avoid conflict, you didn't lie (you had plans) but you didn't volunteer information. Well within your rights. Look after yourself and hopefully you find your happy place...", "TBH a judgement on this one is difficult, becuase we need a bit of a background on who the AH was post the drama\n\nNTA from what it seems like, though", "YTA! It's completely your choice to not see them. You don't need to excuse or justify yourself to them. You told the social worker, that's all you were required to do. A big part of therapy is also listening to the person in front of you and they're clearly not doing that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
