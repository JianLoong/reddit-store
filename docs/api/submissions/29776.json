I\u2019d don\u2019t discuss my sex life with my sister. I certainly don\u2019t discuss my sex life with my SIL (married toy brother).\n\nHonestly my sister and I haven\u2019t spoken in years and don\u2019t get along. Just being sisters doesn\u2019t automatically mean you have to best friends or even be friends at all.", "NTA\n\nYour entire family has set boundaries and she refuses to respect them", "NTA.  Sisters don't share that kind of stuff. People who have a close friendship (and might happen to be sisters) share that kind of stuff. That's not something you have with her.", "NTA, only your brother and SIL are. Seriously I get SIL's desire to be part of a family but trying to force it by stepping over people's boundaries is not it. So she's been told by everyone (including you) to stop pushing boundaries, but has anyone had a serious conversation with her and your brother regarding that?", "NTA she definitely needs to learn boundaries and your brother should probably explain to her that his sister doesn\u2019t want to know about his sex life", "NTA It\u2019s inappropriate and icky that she tries to tell you about her sex life with your brother. And even if she were your biological sister, and wanted to tell you  about adult activities with her husband, I\u2019d say the same. I have a sister and a brother. All of us are married and never do any of us or our spouses share such intimate details with each other. \n\nI\u2019d tell her that even sisters don\u2019t normally discuss these matters and it\u2019s no reflection on your feelings about her to let her know that this is TMI. Then I\u2019d change the subject.\n\nETA: I have no idea what my siblings and their spouses do in bed and want to keep it that way!", "I am older, but I could totally see myself sticking my fingers in my ears and chanting \"La la la la la... cannot talk about sex with you.... la la la la la...\"\n\nI was at a bridal shower for brother's second wife and she made some sex comments, and I was pretty clear that I had NO desire to know about my brother's sex life and would appreciate her never going there with me around. But, she listened.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She is not wrong for wanting to connect, but she is wrong for constantly trampling boundaries you set. Tell your brother the detailed review she gave of sexual performance and reiterate that you do not want to hear these things and you'renot sorry for that. She needs other friends so she can share things that are not appropriate to share with you. That's on her. She's being really immature and disrespectful of all of you.", "NTA I'd tell the brother about his sex life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They need to accept that", "NTA. This is not a case of you not accepting that she is part of the family, it is you not wanting the same kind of relationship she does (which is totally valid). She is the one not accepting reality", "NTA - I don\u2019t have a sister, but I do have a brother. The last thing I want to hear about is his sex life, be it from him or a partner. I don\u2019t even like hearing about my friends\u2019 sex life a lot of the time and I\u2019m only only talking about it with my close close friends. Your sil needs to realize that marrying into the family entitles her to nothing. She needs to become friends with you and the rest of your family gradually", "NTA - I'm close to both my sister and my BIL and we have never once had any discussions about our sex lives. Perhaps some siblings do, but that would be a mutual discussion, not just one person constantly unloading on the other. I feel like your SIL got her impression of a sisterly relationship from Hollywood, not reality. Maybe that's a tough pill to swallow, but her actual relationship with you won't improve until she adjusts her expectations.", "NTA.  She needs to be told, \u201cno, most sisters do not share this stuff.  I do not want to hear it and have told you repeatedly.\u201d", "I have a mostly ok relationship with my sister. I haven't seen her in 4 months but we text basically every day. We have never had a conversation about either of our sex lives except for exactly one sentence in high school 15 years ago. (\"I'm never having sex again.\" After being overwhelmed with baby shower registry options for a work friend.)", "I just don\u2019t get why she is doing after multiple people have talked to her. It\u2019s like she made up what we should be doing and can\u2019t deal with us saying no", "Yes, my mom did. It didn\u2019t go well and it was a huge stink that according to my brother my mom is being the evil MIL.", "That says alot about her upbringing tbh. Sounds like someone who was an only child and the parent's didn't make her adhere to boundaries in a healthy way so now she just doesn't, that doesn't mean others have to put up with it though.", "Maybe she just wants what you have.  She has no siblings and maybe she has an idea in her mind about what her husbands family is supposed to be.  ie you are now sisters and sisters confide in each other, and she is MILs daughter and not daughter in law.", "Does she do it in front of your brother? He might understand better if you called him, your parents, etc. around and then said, \"Please continue telling us about how brother railed you last night.\" Or \"wow, so your ex was that much bigger/better than brother, huh? \"  Unless he's also prone to oversharing, that might put things into perspective. It might be worth a family dinner discussion of their sex lives to get it through his head since she clearly doesn't get it. You're not sisters or bffs there's no code of secrecy between you, so treat anything she says as public information to be shared.", "Looks like SIL's normal meter is broken and she might need to see a therapist."]}
