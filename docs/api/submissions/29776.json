Perhaps some siblings do, but that would be a mutual discussion, not just one person constantly unloading on the other.

He might understand better if you called him, your parents, etc. around and then said, \"Please continue telling us about how brother railed you last night.\" Or \"wow, so your ex was that much bigger/better than brother, huh? \"  Unless he's also prone to oversharing, that might put things into perspective.

While it might be too much for you to talk about sex and that's ok to set that boundary, you're TA for telling her you aren't sisters. You're keeping her as an outsider and that's a surefire way to create a wedge between you and your brother, if not lose your brother entirely. \nInstead of telling her you aren't sisters, you could tell her thay sharing these types of intimate details are not a part of your family's culture and it makes you uncomfortable, but you would welcome other topics, and then bring her in on some other discussions.", "YTA - I know I am going against everyone, and I don't care. I see this crap on here a lot about SIL trying to be involved and families pushing them out for one reason or another. You have every right to set conversational boundaries; however, what you said to her was unnecessarily cruel. What ever happened to accepting people for who they are? So she is sn oversharer. I'm sure you have faults, too. The difference is your blood family, so everyone just has to accept them, right? Family is family. It doesn't matter how they came to be your family. And being part of a family is accepting all of them. This may be news to you, but familial closeness is usually generated by the woman in a relationship. I can already see that your behavior is going to result in you seeing your brother less and less. And then, in some time, you and your family are going to sit around and talk about how your sil ruined your relationship. When that day comes, you need to take a long look in the mirror. Your actions have consequences. Your words have power. All she wants is to be close to you. How have you tried to include her? How have you tried to incorporate her into the family? People remember how you make them feel. If you continue to treat her like an outsider, that is exactly what she will become.", "So wait why was it okay for you to complain about someone but then when she complained she's not allowed?", "You\u2019re the ass hole.

Unfortunately, your brother will side with his wife because he lives with her 24-7.  It won\u2019t go well for him if he disagrees with her.  Your being scapegoated.  Your SIL never had siblings growing up so she has this wishful thinking problem.  Little does she know that siblings growing up together are often annoying to one another\u2026. Often not respecting the other\u2019s space.

If you are expected to listen to his sex life, he needs to listen to yours. You don't actually have to give him details, lol just make your point. I'd totally make up some shenanigans to embarrass my brother but I give 0 fucks. I'm sure there's resources online that would help you, too. Definitely look up boundary setting and practice it.

One of my sisters and I are very open and talk about sex, and we're both comfortable with that (as long as it isn't too detailed lol). My other sister is not, so that's a topic that we don't bring up with her, but I'd be fine if she decided one day to talk about it. But I would never be comfortable talking to my husband's sister about my sex with her brother, and I'm sure she's very thankful for that.

It seems like the way she facilitates relationships is through open communication with people she loves, so to the sister, it just doesn\u2019t click that this would make OP uncomfortable or why. OP is saying \u201cI\u2019m not your family\u201d but I think the SIL is right, OP is part of her family. In my family we talk about sex with everyone but my dad who has a don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell sort of policy about it. It\u2019s not really that weird if that\u2019s what your family is comfortable with so to the SIL, this is normal and OP is the one being weird. But to OP the SIL is weird and they\u2019re just trying to be normal. I think ESH because although the SIL is ignoring OP\u2019s boundary, OP said something that can not be taken back and purposely hit on one of SIL\u2019s deepest insecurities. Also they insist on changing her and saying she\u2019s weird.", "I agree, I think that it is important for the SIL to learn boundaries but it sounds like she doesn't have a lot of experience in this area. The OP could just remind her that she doesn't want to hear about her brothers sex life and redirect the conversation so that the SIL still feels like she is bonding with the family. It honestly just sounds like the SIL wants to be loved and accepted and just needs to break the habit of oversharing. We all have family members that can be difficult but once they are part of your family, if you want a good relationship, you need to work on it. My husbands SIL and my MIL had a lot of issues because my MIL is very caring and needs to feel helpful and my SIL was super independent and would get offended over everything my MIL said when really all she wanted was to show my SIL that she loved her. They both had to work on boundaries and although it was rough at first now they have a really good relationship. My MIL doesn't overstep anymore and my SIL realized that it was okay to accept help. My point is that OP should not have said that her SIL wasn't her sister because that was just cruel and they really just need to have open conversations about boundaries and they both have things to work on. I don't really think this should be an OP versus SIL situation when they are both in the wrong.", "She romanticized what having a sister is like. She cant seem to accept reality.

Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "I\u2019m not sure if will help, but there was a similar AITA situation where the SIL pushed boundaries to to be part of her new family. \n\nWhen eventually confronted by the whole family and brother (her SIL\u2019s husband) they found she may have only married the brother because she was promised that she\u2019d be part of the family. When asked if she\u2019d stay with her husband if they wouldn\u2019t accept her, she couldn\u2019t answer. \n\nYou might be in a similar situation where she might only be with your brother to gain a new, better family", ">according to my brother, my mom is being the evil MIL.\n\nMaybe you should all have the talk at different times. That way, one of two solutions will occur. \n\n1. Your brother and SIL get the point and back the f off.\n\n2 you will all become \"evil\" according to brother and he will go LC or NC with the lot of you (i don't think the contact issue will last long though because of SILs desire to be family and she seems to have your brother wrapped around her finger if he demands you be uncomfortable with her pushing boundaries just to make her happy).\n\nYou can decide which is the best and worst out comes but I definitely think you ALL need to say something.", "Maybe but definitely chasing something she feels is missing. Even if it wasn\u2019t sex details about OP\u2019s sibling she wants to dish about, forcing anyone to listen to details about intimate stuff when they don\u2019t want to is bad.", "I also have ADHD and second this.\n\nWe do have a tendency to overshare especially when trying to bond and blurting things out without self-editing or that aren\u2019t socially appropriate. We also have difficulty reading social cues (body language, tone etc), understanding subtext and struggle with boundaries between what you should or shouldn't say and when to speak up or not.\n\nI\u2019m very close with my sister who also has ADHD and we share things with each other we don\u2019t with others but we still never discuss our sex lives together. That\u2019s a topic people usually only discuss with close friends if they\u2019re comfortable but out of respect for your partner, I also think it\u2019s best to refrain from discussing intimate details about them with people they also have close relationships with or might otherwise be awkward/cross boundaries for them.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Her behaviour is inappropriate whether she possibly has ADHD or not and it\u2019s not an excuse for ignoring your boundaries and discussing her sex life with your brother.\n\nIt definitely sounds like she has a romanticised picture of what having a sister would be like and is trying to force you to fit her fantasy. These issues may be due to her childhood but your brother needs to talk to her about her inappropriate behaviour and help her understand healthy boundaries to fit into the family.", "This along the lines of what I was thinking.  She's trying too hard to fit in and be \"one of the sisters\".  And then, thinking she's part of the \"sisterhood\", she's trying to behave they way the rest of them would with each other.  My friend B had a friend S who friended me on FB.  S was making a certain type of joke that I was uncomfortable with and I told him as much. He said, \"But you and B talk like that\" and I reminded him that B and I have known each other since junior high while I had only just \"met\" S.  It's possible that SIL is acting the way she thinks that real sisters act without realizing that she's not at that level.  (And for all those saying they don't talk sex with their sisters, some of us do.  But I wouldn't discuss a sibling's sex life with their significant other.)"]}
