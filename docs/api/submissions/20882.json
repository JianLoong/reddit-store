Every day the bird tells her she's ugly and from day to day the woman gets angrier. She notices that the bird only talks  to her and never interacts with other people passing by.

The manager says, that he will talk to the parrot and tells her that the bird will never ever say that she is ugly. He promises it to her.\nThe next morning the woman walks past the pet shop but the parrot does not ignore her and again beginns to talk\n \"Hey, you!\"\nThe woman walks to the cage and the parrot looks her in the eyes and says \"Hey, you! *...you know the truth*\"", "You ought to rent him out!  :)", "He\u2019s just copying them.

Those that weren't expletives were, to say the least, rude.\n\nThe man tried hard to change the bird's attitude and was constantly saying polite words, playing soft music, anything he could of. Nothing worked. He yelled at the bird, and the bird got worse. He shook the bird and the bird got madder and ruder.\n\nFinally, in a moment of desperation, he put the parrot in the freezer. For a few moments he heard the bird squawking and kicking and screaming, and then, suddenly, there was quiet. The man was frightened that he might have actually hurt the bird and quickly opened the freezer door.\n\nThe parrot calmly stepped out onto the man's extended arm and said:\n\n\"I'm sorry that I might have offended you with my language and actions and ask for your forgiveness.
