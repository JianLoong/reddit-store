I told her is one thing to replace one or two ingredients, but the overall result will be impacted if I go for the cheapest alternative everywhere. She insisted it will be fine, she says she\u2019s sure it will turn out great.\n\nThen I said I would mind, because if the food is not up to my standards, I won\u2019t feel comfortable to introduce my business. So she said I can just cook it as a gift to her, and not to involve my business name. I reminded her this was one of the conditions of me \u201cworking for free\u201d.

Show of your skills by making accessible ingredients sing. Anyone can make foie gras impressive, try making chuck roast something people rave about. \n\nBasically you tried to not only cheap out on a birthday gift for your sister, but then you made her cover the cost of a self-promotion event, and you got pissy when she balked at the price.

Plus, she's right, you ARE seeing this more as a business promotion event than a gift to her. A true gift would have paid for ingredients for up to a set number of people (i.e. 6) and anything over that would be an additional cost on a per plate basis (i.e. $100/plate). That way, she would actually be receiving something that she holds value to and have the ability to scale up the dinner if she wanted to.\n\nI get wanted to have the right ingredients. I cook all our dinners because my wife has some significant dietary restrictions and hates cooking so I have to be very particular about what goes into our meals. That being said, if I'm making a \"gift\" dinner for someone, I make sure I contribute more than just my labor.", "YTA You are treating this like free advertising and expecting your sister to pay for it. Did you suggest a spread outside her price range because you hoped to impress potential customers? Well, word of mouth spreads fast, and behaving like this won't gain any customers from her friends. In fact, you'll more likely gain a reputation for being needlessly expensive and difficult among them. You attached conditions to a gift that are a detriment to your sister.\n\nIf you want to advertise, pay for the ingredients yourself or go halves. But really, don't be tacky and use a birthday gift as an advertising opportunity.", "NAH \n\nI think you both misunderstood what the other wanted and OP you should never mix family and business unless very specific and clear boundaries are set such as the budget.", "NTA. your sister is being entitled.  You are completely within your rights to choose how to present your business and it's entirely up to you how you want to celebrate your sister's birthday.

You are starting a business. Your sister came to you and asked you to do this. You not only agreed to do it, but you offered her a huge discount. Now she wants you to use cheap ingredients because apparently the huge discount isn't enough for her. Next time someone asks you to cook, give them your full price. If you choose to discount it, ask them for the amount you need for your ingredients, and THEN tell them the remainder of the bill will be comped. This way you use the ingredients you want, your cooking doesn't suffer, they feel like they got a great deal, and all sides go away happy. Imagine if you use the cheap stuff she wants you to use. The meal may taste like crap and you know she is going to be the first one to complain and ask for her money back on the ingredients because YOU screwed up the meal.

Hahahah", "You should use this as a lesson that ingredients budget needs to be in the discussion during menu planning. It really depends on that I suppose if yta or not.", "YTA, if the menu isn't feasible at her price point you need to change the menu not whatever this nonsense is", ">Also honestly if you can only use the best ingredients to make something tasty, you\u2019re not versatile.\n\n\nThis is very true. There was a popular korean tv show featuring celebrity chefs using everyday ingredients out of people's pantries and fridges (so think ramen, frozen food, leftovers and partially eaten takeouts) to make tasty dishes.\n\n\nDepending on what OP is planning to cook, there may be certain type of ingredients that can't be subtituted, but it doesn't seem like the sister is talking about \"type of ingredients\" here. She seems to only be talking about quality/price point.", "Except this wasnt supposed to be a presentation of his buisness but a gift", "[removed]", "Yup\nBefore the amateur cooking show were everywhere,  one of the first I saw, had a single mom as a contestant.  And the judging chef explained that single moms (parents) actually were a lot better cooks than star chefs, in his opinion.  They don't get to use a professional kitchen, have no assistance, have to make do with the cheapest possible ingredients,  and mostly have the worst and most entitled customers.  \nIt's a lot easier to cook when you get to tell ppl what to do with top notch ingredients in a star kitchen.", "Makes me think of Guys Grocceey Games. Sometimes they are restricted to one aisle to buy everything, or no fresh ingredients, etc. No mercy, it still has to be beautiful and delicious.", "A decent dish for any night isn\u2019t the same as a professionally catered birthday dinner, which is what OP\u2019s sister wanted but for free. Just because we have to cook to survive doesn\u2019t mean that professional chefs time and experience is worthless.", "Bullhsit. \n\nMy wife is a chef.

He likes to mix drinks, create his own etc.   \nLast Christmas and NYE he was at our home and we were invited to NYE party to some friends. He agreed to be \" a barman\" there and mix us drinks. My friend, who was hosting the party, haven't even a drink mixer, not saying about all these sirups and ingredients. He managed anyway to mix us beautiful and very tasty drinks of ingredients she had at home.", "Yeah, birthday gifts tend to be free. Notice how OP called it \u201ca birthday gift to her.\u201d People tend not to charge for that. OP isn\u2019t a catering business to her, he\u2019s cooking her a nice dinner as a gift. \n\nHe\u2019s calling it a gift under false pretenses though, because he\u2019s actually just using this as a free advertising opportunity, getting her to pay for a bunch of fancy, expensive ingredients just so he can show off to her friends. And for what, just so she has the privilege of eating his oh-so-brilliant cooking? The fact is that individual ingredients like spices and herbs \u2014 which can be costly \u2014 don\u2019t come in one serving packages. So she\u2019s going to have all these leftover ingredients she doesn\u2019t need. In total, she\u2019s basically paying the same as she would if she were to attend OP\u2019s restaurant. Meats, vegetables, and spices aren\u2019t cheap, that shit can add up to like 20$, even more since she\u2019s buying enough for a whole party.\n\nIt\u2019s a shitty birthday gift, OP is just using her. Honestly at this point she might as well just hire a regular catering company and have OP buy her a normal gift like some socks \u2014 that\u2019d already be more than he\u2019s already giving her", "It\u2019s only considered a gift because OP\u2019s sister ASKED him to \u201cgift her\u201d his professional services catering her birthday dinner she chose to throw. She is the one who instigated getting her brother\u2019s professional services for free because she doesn\u2019t actually respect the professional aspect. It\u2019s hilarious that you think she would easily be able to hire a replacement caterer that will be readily available or that the cost of ingredients is in any way comparable to the cost of labor. \n\nIf you think $20 is expensive for birthday dinner ingredients for a party of people you have no concept of what catering costs."]}
