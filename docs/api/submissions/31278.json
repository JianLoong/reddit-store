I\u2019m hired for special events and dinners, I listen to the client\u2019s idea for a menu, I provide some options, then I buy the ingredients and prepare the meals for the approved dishes. My (32) sister\u2019s birthday is coming up and she decided to host a dinner. She asked me to cook, and I agreed not to charge for her my labor a) as a birthday gift to her, and b) because I appreciate this chance to promote my business to her friends as well.\n\nThe thing is, after we settled on a menu, she kept complaining that the ingredients I chose for the recipes were too costly and kept suggesting I look for cheaper options (she\u2019s paying for the ingredients, after all). I told her is one thing to replace one or two ingredients, but the overall result will be impacted if I go for the cheapest alternative everywhere. She insisted it will be fine, she says she\u2019s sure it will turn out great.\n\nThen I said I would mind, because if the food is not up to my standards, I won\u2019t feel comfortable to introduce my business. So she said I can just cook it as a gift to her, and not to involve my business name. I reminded her this was one of the conditions of me \u201cworking for free\u201d. I said I refused going ahead on her terms. Now she says I\u2019m being sort of an AH for seeing her birthday more as a business opportunity, and not making it about her.

I mean, I wouldn't treat a customer this way, either, but for you to make your 'birthday present' to your own sister more about advertising some non-existant business than making someone you presumably love happy?  Yer a dick.\n\nHow many *thousands* of times in my career has a chit come in for something I wouldn't eat myself? And how many *thousands* of times have I made the customer what they asked for? And they're just strangers.", "You want free sampling and advertising at her expense?\n\nYour ulterior motive is to promote your business, so you should split the cost of ingredients with her.\nAt least she gets a good birthday meal and you get your food sampled by her guests.\n\nETA   ....YTA", "YTA. It\u2019s a gift to her. I know chefs have egos but geeze. You\u2019re looking to profit/promote off her birthday\u2026 if you care so much about the ingredients why are you not paying? She obviously not your normal clientele. \n\nLeaving would also leave her to have to find someone else\u2026\n\n\nLet it go. Also honestly if you can only use the best ingredients to make something tasty, you\u2019re not versatile.", "YTA. You \u201cgift\u201d her your services, then probably push her towards a menu that\u2019s out of her price range (cause your real motive is to turn your \u201cgift\u201d into a promotion for your business) then get upset when she says she can\u2019t afford the menu you wanted for her birthday. \n\nYou want to make a good impression as a chef and caterer, show of your skills by making accessible ingredients sing. Anyone can make foie gras impressive, try making chuck roast something people rave about. \n\nBasically you tried to not only cheap out on a birthday gift for your sister, but then you made her cover the cost of a self-promotion event, and you got pissy when she balked at the price. Through and through the AH.", "NTA: You change ingredients. You change the taste. F that. I'm not a chef, and I wouldn't even do that.", "NTA. I can understand protecting your reputation and business, do it your way or not at all. You can simply buy her a birthday gift instead, or cook her dinner without other guests. If she is hosting an event, even without you having an opportunity to showcase your business, I can guarantee that guests will at some stage get to know of the \u201dpersonal chef\u201d aspect of the evening.", "If two sisters can\u2019t agree and plan on the menu for one meal without it turning into a struggle, well, I don\u2019t know to tell you. Working as a professional personal chef will mean you work within the parameters of your client. You\u2019ll go hungry yourself unless you learn to work for your client. You\u2019re selling a service. Look at this is a learning opportunity for coming to a workable agreement for your future business.", "This is what happens when families think their family members are obligated to perform their jobs free of charge for them. That their talents are worth nothing and they are entitled to them. Like expecting a doctor in your family to give you free medical care or cut the quality of what is required just to fit their budget and telling them what to do when they are the professional.", "NTA, but you can help buying the ingredients that she can't afford, she's your sister after all and it's her birthday.", "NTA\n\nMaybe change the menu to better match your sisters  budget.  \nDelicious doesn't necessarily mean expensive.", "NTA. You have a professional reputation to uphold and doing a subpar job would damage that", "You want to work as a personal chef but fail to stay within the \u201cclient\u2019s\u201d budget/parameters on the very first occasion. \n\nYTA. You don\u2019t do this as a gift, you want to advertise at her expense.", "YTA. If she\u2019s paying for the ingredients she has every right to say if something is too expensive. As a professional you should be able to accommodate your client\u2019s budget. Also it seems like you are more focused on it being an opportunity for your business as opposed to a celebration for your sister.", "NAH. I get it. You don't want to have weird tasting/low quality food associated with you when you're trying to have a business as a chef. \n\nAlso I'm curious whether this is a big ask in the first place. How big is the party she's having you cook for? How in-depth is this menu?\n\nI think she's realizing that she wants professional food but can't really afford to pay for it. Maybe just back out while she can find other options and get her something else as a gift.", "NTA  If it was all about promoting your business and not about her birthday then you wouldn't be having the discussion with her. Does she truly believe that any professional chef would want to make a special dinner for someone with substandard ingredients? Your name would still be attached to the dinner whether you promoted your business or not.", "NTA\n\nIt's not just about your reputation. It's about the dishes turning out well.", "YTA. \u201cWorking for free\u201d is not working for free when you have to put quotes around it and if there are conditions. This is not a gift, imo if she is paying for anything. If you want to promote your business you should do so at your own expense and it shouldn\u2019t be a condition of the gift. Gifts are to be given freely without expecting anything in return. If you make a dish that is subpar it is not your sister\u2019s fault. If you and she agree that she will pay for ingredients, let her pay what she is comfortable with and you cover the rest. However, don\u2019t call it a \u201cgift\u201d. Paying for advertising is part of being a business owner. And allowing someone to pay for any part of their birthday gift is an Asshole move.", "NTA.\nIf ingredients you don't approve of are being used and people don't like the food, they'll think you're giving excuses and think less of you as a chef. You know what quality ingredients you need to make a delicious meal AND leave a lasting positive impression of your skills. She should respect that and not try to devalue your brand.", "YTA and if you can't cook a dope meal on a budget for someone you love you probably aren't much of a chef either \ud83e\udee4", "NTA; your sister is being a choosy beggar. You offered a service, and now she\u2019s asking you to change the terms of your agreement and provide an inferior service because she\u2019s feeling too cheap to uphold her end of the bargain. Good for you for keeping the standards of your craft high.", "YTA.\n\nWhile your sister shouldn't have been haggling over ingredients after the menu was set, I don't get the impression that you gave her any indication of an estimated menu cost. Plus, she's right, you ARE seeing this more as a business promotion event than a gift to her. A true gift would have paid for ingredients for up to a set number of people (i.e. 6) and anything over that would be an additional cost on a per plate basis (i.e. $100/plate). That way, she would actually be receiving something that she holds value to and have the ability to scale up the dinner if she wanted to.\n\nI get wanted to have the right ingredients. I cook all our dinners because my wife has some significant dietary restrictions and hates cooking so I have to be very particular about what goes into our meals. That being said, if I'm making a \"gift\" dinner for someone, I make sure I contribute more than just my labor.", "YTA You are treating this like free advertising and expecting your sister to pay for it. Did you suggest a spread outside her price range because you hoped to impress potential customers? Well, word of mouth spreads fast, and behaving like this won't gain any customers from her friends. In fact, you'll more likely gain a reputation for being needlessly expensive and difficult among them. You attached conditions to a gift that are a detriment to your sister.\n\nIf you want to advertise, pay for the ingredients yourself or go halves. But really, don't be tacky and use a birthday gift as an advertising opportunity.", "NAH \n\nI think you both misunderstood what the other wanted and OP you should never mix family and business unless very specific and clear boundaries are set such as the budget.", "NTA. your sister is being entitled.  You are completely within your rights to choose how to present your business and it's entirely up to you how you want to celebrate your sister's birthday. If she's not happy with the proposal then as long as it's not last minute it's entirely fine for you to be clear about your boundaries and let her choose.", "Yta - you sound pretentious and unbearable.", "If you insist on high quality ingredients to promote your business then you should be paying. YTA", "YTA. Any real chef will make what it do with whatever ingredients given to him. Shoot I\u2019m not even a chef and i decided to try my hand at making chili the other night for the first time. Everywhere i looked on for the recipe i saw it said tomato paste and tomato sauce. I didn\u2019t have either but i did have two tomatoes in my fridge and that\u2019s what i used. It came out so good. My husband said \u201cdo it like this again. If you try it with the stuff you said was missing then you just experimenting\u201d. \nSo either get in the kitchen and show off your skills with \u201clesser\u201d ingredients or don\u2019t cook.", "NTA\n\nFrankly, I'm amazed at the number of people claiming you are. You are starting a business. Your sister came to you and asked you to do this. You not only agreed to do it, but you offered her a huge discount. Now she wants you to use cheap ingredients because apparently the huge discount isn't enough for her. Next time someone asks you to cook, give them your full price. If you choose to discount it, ask them for the amount you need for your ingredients, and THEN tell them the remainder of the bill will be comped. This way you use the ingredients you want, your cooking doesn't suffer, they feel like they got a great deal, and all sides go away happy. Imagine if you use the cheap stuff she wants you to use. The meal may taste like crap and you know she is going to be the first one to complain and ask for her money back on the ingredients because YOU screwed up the meal. It won't matter that you were following her instructions. It won't matter that she said it would be fine. She will absolutely try to get more out of you, just like she's trying to now.", "YTA\n\nPay for some of the ingredients if you are getting advertising out of it when it is supposed to be a gift.  Most people would cook for their sister and get her a gift.  You are being cheap by offering time but no money", ">I\u2019m being sort of an AH for seeing her birthday more as a business opportunity, and not making it about her. AITA here?\n\nYup. YTA.", "YTA", "YTA seriously this is your sister. Maybe her gift would be what she wants for what she can afford rather than fancy stuff she can\u2019t.. and to use her birthday purposely as a marketing and advertising moment isn\u2019t classy at all.

So she said I can just cook it as a gift to her, and not to involve my business name.\n\nYou don't give a shit about your sister, you only care about advertising. You are such a pretentious asshole.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s your sister\u2019s birthday, not a networking event.", "YTA get what her budget is for ingredients, work with that, if you need to upgrade, pay the difference.\n\nStop being so prissy", "I wouldn't say that your time is not precious but if it is your gift, is it really different from what you usually do at other events and on those events are you saying it is your gift? If yes, let be it, but she provides and you try and make something great out of it.\nIf not, pay for some damned things, moreover if you want to advertise (didn't the restaurant where you worked pay when promoting ?), it's an investment, and you can square the budget : focus on the dishes you really want to make and pay for the ingredients. From the story you are telling, yes, YTA because it seems that your sister is paying for you to make a network and it is HER birthday.", "YTA dude make it the way she wants (she\u2019s paying for the ingredients, after all).\n\nIf it turns out tasting like crap well then thats on her i guess. Or it just means you suck as a chef and cant make a decent meal with the ingredients you get.", "YTA. This is clearly not a gift for your sister; she's fine with cheaper ingredients. You want expensive items because your focus is on some free advertising. If you want to insist on expensive ingredients, pay for them yourself.", ">She asked me to cook, and I agreed not to charge for her my labor a) as a birthday gift to her, and b) because I appreciate this chance to promote my business to her friends as well.\n\nYou were so interested in using your sister's birthday to promote your business and you sister was so interested in free labor, that you both forgot to negotiate a budget. \n\nESH", "YTA you are not giving her a gift of a meal, you just want to use it as a promotion.\n\nHonestly, I would tell you to pound sand, uninvite you and order food at a party service.\n\nShe is your sister first and the business opportunity should be far down that list.
