We were chilling enjoying the equipment when I heard crying. Not usual baby crying- like full on sobbing. Naturally I looked around to make sure everything was ok when I saw a man with his own toddler having a mini meltdown. I asked my husband to keep an eye on our baby and went over to see if I could help. \n\nI started talking with the man and he vented that his kid was being extra defiant and nothing he tried was working. He told me the mother left recently after deciding motherhood wasn\u2019t for her and he\u2019s been having a hard time adjusting. Over the next 30-45 mins I showed him different techniques and told him about different parent sites I read and support groups. Basically anything I thought would help. I also gave him my Facebook page in case he wanted to reach out to vent or needed advice. After he looked very relieved and thankful so I went about my day. \n\nMy husband was quiet when I got back and was acting weird so I asked what was wrong. He said I abandoned my family for a stranger on our day out (he works a lot so it\u2019s rare all 3 of us get to be out together). He then told me I was weird for giving the man my Facebook. I told my husband I did as soon as I rejoined him. \n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it since I didn\u2019t feel comfy giving out my number and I don\u2019t use many social sites.

If the guy didn\u2019t want your help, he would have told you so, not spoken to you for 30-45 minutes. \n\nIs your husband typically jealous?", "NTA. You saw a human being struggling and you did a kind thing in helping him and giving some advice. You didn\u2019t give him your phone number and you still had most of the day with your husband. While I understand he was disappointed, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA, \n\nYou acted as part of the village and reached out to someone who was struggling. You are a wonderful person. \nIt shouldn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a Mum or Dad, if you can help, you should help. \n\nYour husband has you to bounce ideas off this gentleman has nothing, actually less than nothing, because he has an ex partner who decided to chuck in the job of parenting their own child because it got hard so can\u2019t even coparent. \n\nIt\u2019s a well known fact that men don\u2019t reach out to others for assistance, they internalize the issues and sometimes that goes so badly. Women seem to be able to group together, there\u2019s so many \u2018mothers groups\u2019 on Facebook to connect to. Eg, the mothers group I\u2019m on has 28k members, the dads group has 779, yep, it\u2019s in the three digits. \n\nYour husband should have reached out if he\u2019s got an issue with you reaching out.", "NTA. Thank you for stepping up for someone in need. Hopefully your husband can let this go and understand we all need to be kind even if it disrupts our plans for a little bit.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with helping someone.", "NTA, your intentions were wonderful and you're very kind for helping someone in clear need. It could have also been a good opportunity for both children to make a new friend by keeping in touch. While I can see 45 minutes without a word to your husband can be uncomfortable, your husband DOES have free will and also could have chose to come get you, and even join in on the conversation while the kids played. If he sat there stewing in his own irritability for 45 minutes, that is on him.", "NTA. Thank you for helping out the single dad. Your husband needs to get over himself.  He comes off as jealous.", "NTA nothing wrong with a little grace and live towards our fellow man. Sounds like OPs husband is insecure and jealous and probably needs to work through that. What you did was a very decent thing that most people wouldn\u2019t have done. Good on you keep making the world a better place and showing love and compassion for your fellow man!", "NTA empathy is a beautiful thing to roll model for your child. Helping someone in need when it costs you little or nothing is something we need more of in the world.", "NTA, you helped someone who needed help. Your husband needs to grow up. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2018d be glad to get help if you decided to leave him for his immature behavior, even though I doubt you\u2018d ditch your kid as well. Tell him jealousy doesn\u2019t suit him. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nI can see why it might hurt a little when you spend 30 minutes on a stranger when you don't have a lot of family time. However, 30 minutes will seem like nothing to you after a while but it'll be everything to that father forever.", "Helping out others is a kind thing to do, so not the AH here.  Your husband didn't yell, shout, threaten, or in anyway really throw a tantrum.  He deserves time to process it.  NAH so far.", "NTA. You took less than an hour out of your day to help someone who desperately needed help, the world needs more people like you with such empathy, starting with your husband", "NTA, that man probably deserved any help he could get as a single dad and you did the right thing. Your husband could be a bit more mature about the situation.", "Small YTA\nBut a very small one. I also have a helper syndrome and it's nothing to blame. But my husband hates it because I am helping other persons too often and neglect him.\n\nSo you aren't an AH for helping a foreign dad. But you also have to consider your husbands feelings that he wanted to spend time with you.\n\nYou have the superhero issue: There is always someone who needs your help. But your beloved ones don't care if you are a superhero, they want to be your prio 1.", "NTA. The world needs more people like you.", "NTA You were trying to help another parent who is struggling.  That's admirable.  Your husband needs a lesson in empathy.", "NTA\n\nTrust me, you did nothing wrong! You went out of your way to help a newly single parent cope with their child. \n\nYour husband should have felt so proud of you! He should have been praising you instead of acting like a spoilt child having his own meltdown. Has he always been insecure and jealous?", "NAH - you were trying to be nice and your husband had some valid points. 30 minutes is a long time when you\u2019re on a rare family outing; I might be annoyed by that too.", "NTA Your husband seems very insecure.", "45 minutes seems excessive, I don't blame your husband for feeling miffed. Imagine if he had spent that much time talking to another woman at the park. You wouldn't have liked it one bit. No need to treat a single dad like a superhero just because he's alone with a child. Leave people alone.", "NTA Your husband is a jealous, possessive a \\*ole. Watch out for further displays from your husband, and guard against any trespasses into further intimacy from the father. Empathy is a fine line to walk. Good luck and your kindness is a nice thing to see.", "Gentle YTA. You were coming from a good place, but you basically just went off for like 30-45 minutes. You could have very easily after 5-10 said \u201clet me also get my husband and child\u201d instead of leaving him to just sit around waiting for you. It was very kind to the other guy, but also pretty inconsiderate to your husband and needlessly so because you could have easily involved him.", "YTA \n\nrare time with your family and you spend over 30 mins talking to a random guy. Sure it was a nice thing to do but really the conversation with him could have lasted 5 minutes and had the same impact. At the end of the day your family comes first", "45 mins with a stranger? That\u2019s insanity. And then you\u2019re going to be friends online? So he can vent to you? Definitely the AH. You should have only helped the dude for a few mins and went on with your day.!", "YTA you were suppose to be spending time you rarely get with your family and instead spent it with a strange man who you then proceeded to give your information to so you can keep in touch.", "YTA.\n\n1st, that was way too much time to take away from your own family.\n\n2nd, you don't know his story is true, he could have taken his or God forbid, someone else's child from their Mother and that was why the child was acting out. (cynical I know, but I fell for it once, so cut me a break)\n\n3rd put yourself in your husband's shoes. A single Mom and he spends almost an hour with her while you wait on the sideline...", "YTA - You had me all the way up until you gave some dude who was single your facebook info.

There is nothing wrong with that in the least. I'm sure 45 minutes feels like a long time but in the grand scheme of things it isn't much time at all.
