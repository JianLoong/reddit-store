It could have also been a good opportunity for both children to make a new friend by keeping in touch. While I can see 45 minutes without a word to your husband can be uncomfortable, your husband DOES have free will and also could have chose to come get you, and even join in on the conversation while the kids played.

It\u2019s not an insecurity thing or a jealousy thing. It just wasn\u2019t the point of the outing and idk how often you guys get to do that sort of thing together. The world is full of parents with defiant kids at parks and there are so many online resources for parenting that this just feels unnecessary.", "NAH\n\nYou did something very kind for someone who was obviously struggling. That's cool, but your husband still has the right to feel sad about missing out on family time with you. You said he works a lot and was probably looking forward to spending some time with the two most important people in his life. 30-45 minutes is a long time to be gone when you just told your husband you'll see if you can help.\n\nMaybe you should have come back after a couple of minutes to tell you husband something like \"Hey, this guy is completely overwhelmed being alone with his kid. I'll show him some stuff to help him out. Do you want to come over there with me? You could speak to him from dad to dad and share some things I probably don't know about.\"\n\nThe facebook thing is a bit.. iffy, I guess. Some people strictly use it for family and long term, real life friends, while others just don't care. I had a girlfriend who started cheating on me through adding a stranger on facebook when I was younger, so I certainly understand your husband's thoughts. At the same time I don't think everyone adding strangers is looking to cheat. You most certainly didn't give that stranger your profile so you could start having an affair, which makes you thinking it isn't a big deal understandable.\n\nAll in all I'd say just talk to each other. Both of you should try putting yourself in the other's shoes. Speaking from a male perspective, he might feel a bit threatened by the stranger because he is working a lot and feels like he isn't around as much as he thinks he should be and is afraid of you just randomly finding another dude and dumping him. Or he's just insecure in general (which a lot of us are because of some insane expectations put on us by society). That's why communication is key. Hope you guys can sort everything out and move forward together.", "NAH.", "NAH.

Very reasonable to be upset about this, even if Op was helping out a friend rather than a stranger. Husband was probably really looking forward to this outing and felt like he was his wife's lowest priority.  It wasn't an emergency.\n\nOp did a kind thing. Was it really neccessary to spend 45 min, rather than 10 and a referral to a parent meet up group? Maybe she got caught up in the moment. It doesn't make her an ass but her husband has good reason to be upset and he isn't one either.\n\nNah.", "This is the absolute correct response.", "How do you know that 45 min was half the outing? That\u2019s a presumptuous assumption. The husband actually comes across as having no empathy to me", "Yes, 45 minutes is not a long time. It's like one class period. It's unlikely she could have done anything in 10 minutes. OP's husband is clearly jealous or insecure. He saw his wife, doing what she does best, which is being a mother. He should have been chilled, spent some daddy child time (if it's so precious) and it would have been a good day for all parties.\n\nOP's husband shouldn't have her on a leash. Op did a good thing and as a mother needs to be appreciated for it. 45 minutes to help a distressed (abandoned) child and father is not a good reason for hubby to be upset.", "Respectfully disagree. The husband would have seen/heard the man crying too. How do we know it wasn\u2019t an emergency? Toddlers are tough, and the guy\u2019s partner had recently left. Toddler + recent break up is very very tough! We don\u2019t know his mental health history or anything. Lots of men don\u2019t have large friend groups - or not the deeper friendships they can easily turn to for emotional support (hence why male suicide rates are so high 40yrs and up). \nOP is a wonderful human, and the fact that her husband isn\u2019t admiring the F out of her for assisting a distressed stranger is a huge red flag to me. \nIt\u2019s ONE time, not every time they go out.", "In the real world giving your contact details to a complete stranger is insane.\n\nShe knows nothing about this man except that he cannot look after his own child. \n\nShe has now allowed this person into her and her family\u2019s life without any thought about any negative consequences.\n\nAs for the implied jealousy- what planet do you live on? If I went out with my family and my partner decided to spend nearly an hour ignoring our child I would be much more vocal than OP\u2019s husband about my displeasure. \n\nHow much time is she prepared to dedicate to this stranger? Why does he need to be able to contact her? How is she going to help him? Will she be ignoring her child again whenever he pings her fb? \n\nOP has decided that a complete stranger is so important that her child and husband must allow that person into their lives without knowing anything about him, because if she uses fb as most people do that means she posts photos (etc) about her family. \n\nOP YTA for not thinking about your own family first.", "If the spouse can\u2019t trust their partner enough to let them help a single dad/mom who is struggling, they should prob do a deep search within themselves."]}
