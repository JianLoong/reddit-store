We were chilling enjoying the equipment when I heard crying. Not usual baby crying- like full on sobbing. Naturally I looked around to make sure everything was ok when I saw a man with his own toddler having a mini meltdown. I asked my husband to keep an eye on our baby and went over to see if I could help. \n\nI started talking with the man and he vented that his kid was being extra defiant and nothing he tried was working. He told me the mother left recently after deciding motherhood wasn\u2019t for her and he\u2019s been having a hard time adjusting. Over the next 30-45 mins I showed him different techniques and told him about different parent sites I read and support groups. Basically anything I thought would help. I also gave him my Facebook page in case he wanted to reach out to vent or needed advice. After he looked very relieved and thankful so I went about my day. \n\nMy husband was quiet when I got back and was acting weird so I asked what was wrong. He said I abandoned my family for a stranger on our day out (he works a lot so it\u2019s rare all 3 of us get to be out together). He then told me I was weird for giving the man my Facebook. I told my husband I did as soon as I rejoined him. \n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it since I didn\u2019t feel comfy giving out my number and I don\u2019t use many social sites. I tried telling him I was just trying to be helpful and hope someone would help him if he was in that situation. But the way he\u2019s acting now I feel like I should have minded my business. AITA?\n\nEdit: sorry for not getting back but I wanted to address some common questions-\n1. We were at the park about 3 ish hours in total. We were there for a bit, I saw the guy went to chat, and came back to play for another 90 mins\n2. The guy knew I was with my family I pointed them out when I walked over\n3. My husband did come over to introduce himself when I waved him to. I expected him to sit and chat but he didn\u2019t. Just said a few pleasantries and left again until he came back to give me our baby so he could use the restroom. I didn\u2019t think much of it since he\u2019s kinda \u201cawkward\u201d and doesn\u2019t know how to handle emotional people especially strangers.\n4. Our family OUTINGS are rare yes but we still have lots of family time at home. He has 2 days off a week so is actually going OUT is more dependent on his energy/mood not his job\n5. I didn\u2019t approach the man cuz I heard a baby crying and wanted to be a hero. I heard HIM breaking down and simply asked if he needed help. If he would have said no I would have walked away but he accepted and we chatted. I\u2019d do the same for a woman as well.

Both of you should try putting yourself in the other's shoes. Speaking from a male perspective, he might feel a bit threatened by the stranger because he is working a lot and feels like he isn't around as much as he thinks he should be and is afraid of you just randomly finding another dude and dumping him.

If I were your husband I would be upset too. The people saying its a jealousy thing are reaching. You all went out an a RARE outing with the goal of spending tike together bonding. You then chose to spend almost an hour of that time speaking with a stranger and then gave him your contact info which means you\u2019ve committed even further to a random stranger to be their sounding board. I could see your side more if this happened organically and the kid had a meltdown while you all were already in a conversation and you offered some tips then or something like that. I could even see your point if the kid had been crying for a while and the father was getting very clearly frustrated or something. But it sounds like you swooped in within minutes of the kid crying. Why did you feel the need for this? People saying it was kind to help a stranger - also weird to me. I mean OP didn\u2019t even known if he was necessarily struggling.  Kids have tantrums all the time, it doesn\u2019t require every stranger at the park to band together to get them to stop \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA you don't think your Husband should be bothered you spent 45 min of your planned day with him with another man? All the people saying he's insecure and jealous would have an issue if the same was done to them.  The worst part is you gave this stranger your contact info, why do people act like that doesn't lead to something you shouldn't be doing and then are shocked when you are suddenly in a relationship with this stranger?  It was a family outing and you chose a stranger over your family", "NTA. You helped a struggling person, you can't be an AH. Maybe, if he works a bit less he can spend some more time with you? Sometimes the extra money is not worth what you miss out on in life. But please understand that this of course is only a possibility if you financially can (which not many can).", "NTA, you spent some time helping out someone in obvious need. \n\nIs 45 minutes a little excessive to do this? Not knowing the other particulars of the outing, eh, probably. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily put you in the wrong. I don\u2019t think think this is something your husband should be angry about by any means.\n\nIt sounds to me more like a difference in approach of how to interact with strangers. If it were me in the situation, I probably would have kept to my own business like your husband suggests, that\u2019s just my own preference. But I don\u2019t think that makes the kindness you showed inappropriate in any way.", "I want to say NAH but I thought him being quiet and weird keeps me from saying that.  If he would have just communicated following the interaction very plainly and then moved on, definitely NAH.  But as someone who is constantly desperate to be with their spouse due to our shitty work schedules, I would not..could not let something like that spoil the rest of our day.  It would be a quick acknowledgment and let\u2019s move on.\n\nCommunication is key, and being \u201cquiet and weird\u201d and making conscious decision to muddy the rest of the day, leaves me with some suspicion that there\u2019s more to it.  They both made moves that weren\u2019t paramount to have the perfect family outing.  Her actions were obliviously inconsiderate of his feelings (I\u2019m guessing she spends A LOT of time alone with their kid, so she\u2019s constantly focusing on her own and her child\u2019s feelings).  \n\nHe got upset which is reasonable, but didn\u2019t have the emotional maturity to hold a brief discussion to prevent it from occurring again.  So while yes, she should have cut it short and he has every right to be upset, giving someone the cold shoulder during this \u201climited time\u201d makes you a little bit more of an AH.  \n\nIts important to choose your battles, and by giving her some form of the silent treatment is a \u201ctell\u201d that its not all about this incident \u201csucking up their time\u201d.", "Eh...no AHs here \n\nYou tried to help someone in need.  Admirable but you seem to have gone a bit far.  It's one thing to refer someone to an online parenting group, it's another to say \"here's my personal page, feel free to get in touch with me.\"  I can see where your husband didn't feel right about that after you took off and spent so much time with the other guy already.", "You gave someone who needed it a helping hand. I\u2019m a guy, and I would be proud of my wife if I ever saw something like this. You were a super hero to that man for 45 minutes, and he\u2019ll likely never forget it.

Not every day goes according to plan, and I'm sure he was disappointed, but there are extenuating circumstances here.

Not one bit, you kind human. \n\nQuestion: would your husband have reacted this way if it was a mum breaking down? \n\n30 mins to save a stranger out of a whole day isn\u2019t a huge deal, it\u2019s not like you were gossiping - you were helping the guy out", "NTA you saw someone in need and had skills that could help.

I would have done the same. Sometimes, the universe puts us where we need to be. He was struggling. You helped. You are an awesome human!", "NTA - you helped a struggling parent out and there's no reason why your husband couldn't come over and help too, or let the kids play together.\n\nThe only thing is that it shouldn't of lasted 45 minutes.\n\nYour husband sounds jealous and a little insecure.", "NTA.\n\nYou are a very kind person.\n\n.", "NTA.\n\nI can't even begin to count the number of times we've been in public and my husband ends up having long conversations with strangers or helping them. He even spent two hours on our honeymoon helping the couple who ran the bed and breakfast with their computer.\n\nI get your husband's frustration. I've felt it too on occasion, especially when he was working away during the week and was only home on weekends and someone needed him, but ultimately, I was able to understand what a special person my spouse is and I'm very lucky to be with such a kind, compassionate, and helpful person.", "NTA at all.\n\nIf I had a wife and she done that I would be proud of her for doing so\n\nI\u2019m a single father myself and it was a massive learning curve at the start especially having a daughter so I can only imagine how helpful that must have been for that guy", "NTA. Bless your kind heart, I wish there were more people like you out there.", "NTA. You were being helpful. That's all.", "NTA. Thank you so much for helping a family in such a stressful time, you did so much good. Facebook is a good non-ph9ne number way to have controlled interaction with people and help them find a support system. \n\nI can understand your husband being mildly irritated, if you rarely get all three of you. But if he doesn't see his own family that often, maybe there is a bigger issue there?", "NTA. It has always and will always take a village to raise the next generation.  Thank you for being kind, the dad and child were suffering and you chose to help. As long as the dad was open to it you did the right thing. You didn't abandon anyone, that is so dramatic.", "So he got to spend 1:1 time with his child. Maybe if he did that more often he would have better understanding of your empathy to a fellow parent struggling as they try to figure out how to parent! NTA", "NTA. ngl at first I thought this would turn into one of those stories where a nosy person gives unsolicited advice assuming a single dad could not care for their child. but it seems like the dad actually needed help, so kudos for you being empathetic and kind. for your husband, I can totally understand him being annoyed while you were gone and him being a bit grumpy upon your return. but honestly, given the situation and your explanation he should be fine with it imo. giving out contact info is also not a big deal in a relationship between adults that trust each other. it would be different if you hadn't told your husband. but you were transparent so all is well. all in all, I don't think this is a big issue, even if your husbands is stilll a bit jelly or grumpy.", "NTA, you had a human reaction, you reacted with empathy and kindness. Perhaps ask your husband to put himself in that man\u2019s shoes for a moment and ask him if he\u2019d want help.", "What you did was a very nice and kind thing. A man and his toddler both had a breakdown and you stepped in and helped him vent and gave him much needed advice and support. I think that your husband probably feels a bit jealous. NTA", "Yep, thank you. Husband isn't an asshole for wanting to spend family time at the park when he works a lot. OP's not an asshole for helping, either, but 30 to 45 minutes away from the little family time her husband gets is a lot! \n\nWould she have done the same thing if it was a mom struggling? Maybe she would! But people tend to judge moms for not being absolutely perfect while showering dads with help and praise for existing near their kid. \n\nI think the Facebook thing is fine if OP often adds mom friends on Facebook as well. But if it's unusual for her to help out others and give out her Facebook, then I can see why it bothered her husband.", "I can see being annoyed by it, but if family time is that precious and rare, it seems counterintuitive to start a fight and waste even more of that precious family time.\n\nI've been there. At one point, I saw my husband for less than 48 hours per week while I had a toddler and a newborn. And yes, I was annoyed when people needed him, but to me, our time was so precious, I didn't want to waste it berating him for going to help our elderly neighbour shovel snow. I would have felt like a total AH.", "OP stated that she tried to get her husband to come over and join the conversation, and that he wasn't really interested in doing that.", "Nailed it.", "Please ignore this OP. Its a shame that your husband doesn't share your level of empathy, but you have nothing to apologise for.", "Her husband is definitely being an asshole. Take two steps back and think about himself in that situation, stop being a jealous prick. Not every man that talks to your wife is out to sleep with her.\n\nJealousy is the feeling I got from this guy, and not just because he didn't get to spend time with the OP", "I've been where OP is. My husband worked away during the week and we had less than 48 hours together on the weekend while I juggled a 3yo and a newborn. It sucked when his time was taken up by other people needing his help, but in the same vein, I would never waste what little time we had left together by starting a fight with him over helping our elderly neighbour shovel snow or running to his mom's to fix her toilet.\n\nAlso, I disagree with your assessment of the situation. If I see a parent sobbing in public, while it's not an emergency, it is certainly serious and needs to be de-escaleted before it becomes emergent. An overwhelmed or agitated parent could do something out of the ordinary and unintentionally harm their child. \n\nOP did everything right in terms of mental health first aid. She compassionately approached the individual, determined what was upsetting them, offered strategies for in the moment and referred him to other groups, and then provided her contact for follow-up.\n\nWould OP'S husband have lost his cool if she was assisting someone with a broken limb until help arrived? It's not an emergency, but the person still needed help and you can't always put a time limit on when you provide care.", "Sorry, don't they live together or something?

You are good person", "NAH\n\nYou did a kind thing that took that dad out of a bad head space. Even if he doesn't contact you ,you gave him other resources that are more anonymous that he can look in to to find support during this massive change. \n\nBut, being a true crime nut, I can see where you husband might be concerned about family safety and wrapped that up in \"why didn't you spend time with us?!\" dressing. Just because you didn't give him your address and phone number doesn't mean he always has good intentions. You just can never be to careful, people are strange, yes even people with toddlers/kids! \n\nAs far at the spending time away from family during time at the playground I bet the kid was having so much fun they didn't notice mom was chatting with someone. Or if they did they thought it was an old chum or something else and went back to playing. Kids don't think deep like that when they could be playing I think.", "It was really nice of you helping a struggling stranger. NTA\nBut in my opinion you shouldn't give other men your contact details (unless professional or similar). I would definitely feel some type of way if my husband/boyfriend did that.", "Nta. I would be proud of my gf for doing something like this to for a stranger. Maybe even become friends with the dad after he chats with my gf and learns some in's and out's of being a dad. I swear, 99% of the commentors are just super lonely, or have no faith whatsoever in their partners.", "NTA. What you did was very kind, it\u2019s unfortunate your husband doesn\u2019t see it that way.", "I agree. I would like my husband to be helpful, but giving out contact details, facebook whatever, to be able to keep in contact with random women - not so much! That would be crossing the line.", "The dad was the one crying.", "I\u2019m sorry your ex hurt you so badly.", "I didn\u2019t think of this. I hope I didn\u2019t come off cocky. I just saw a parent having a hard time and wanted to extend a helping hand if needed. I will definitely be asking him about this", "It\u2019s like a subtle pettiness I guess? We\u2019re still communicating can spending time together but I can tell he\u2019s a bit salty and when I try to talk about it to squash it he just brushes it off so I\u2019m stuck between is he still mad or does he really not care", "It literally says they were out 3 hours, not 90 minutes.", "I'm an introvert myself so the fact she went over is amazing to me. I would have wanted to help, but would have second guessed myself.", "She literally introduced the husband", "You still aren\u2019t an asshole, I want that to be clear but also clearly your husband was effected negatively some way in this. Idk you or your relationship but I do know people who \u201calways have to help\u201d and if that\u2019s how your husband sees you than it\u2019s worth a discussion", "I love your whole comment.\n\nReal life, rather than young ones thinking they know how adulting works.", "We don\u2019t know that her husband has the skill set to calm down and support someone in crisis. Maybe he does - but we don\u2019t know. If I were the OP and I knew my husband was great at that, I\u2019d send him instead for sure! \nAnd yes, I would absolutely be okay with my partner doing that if the situation called for it. But in our situation, I would probably be the one better equipped to handle said situation.", "OP clarified that on edit #5 after I made my comment.", "Empathy is wonderful. Getting sucked into someone else\u2019s problems is not.\n\nWe are all presuming that OP is capable of actually helping the guy, yet she has demonstrated a very basic lack of self preservation and has exposed her family to risk. \n\nStopping and helping with a crying child is admirable. Staying with him for nearly an hour while ignoring her own child is not.\n\nGiving him resources to help is admirable. Giving him her personal details and allowing a total stranger into her private space is not.\n\nIf this guy becomes a problem, how is OP going to disentangle herself from him after this? \n\nAlways treat everyone with caution until they prove otherwise- especially when you have your own young child to protect- that should always be a parents primary concern.", "He won\u2019t. He also wouldn\u2019t do anything like this.", "Because he probably isn't active,  and he was pissed he had to \"babysit\" the whole time Op was helping the poor guy out.", "We have free childcare and don\u2019t need to work so much that 30 minutes of kindness to a fellow human being in need would noticeably detract from our time together.", "I\u2019m literally still a child and I\u2019d do the same thing op did also not once did she ever say anything about being flirtatious, she also was right to be there for 45 minutes because she was showing how it worked and talking to help him", "*dumb", "Love this comment. \n\nMade me laugh because I\u2019ve been with my partner for over 4 decades and would respond exactly like that!", "To be fair I should\u2019ve asked this in the beginning but what do you mean by chat her up depending on that my point will vary", "It\u2019s not living in fear, it\u2019s having common sense and protecting your family. Nobody has accused anyone of infidelity\u2026\u2026.and random people can be dangerous. \n\nFine_Baseball6921 used great terminology \u2018family\u2019s space\u2019- that should be held sacred above all else. \n\nShow compassion in the moment, but always look after your own first and protect your family\u2019s space.", "Nobody accused OP of being flirtatious?????\n\nThere are three things at play here.\n\nOne- the assumption that OP can actually help, which we don\u2019t know for a fact.\n\nTwo- giving out her private information to a complete stranger and exposing her child to potential danger.\n\nThree- OP\u2019s need to help a stranger outweighing her own family\u2019s needs shows that OP might not always make great decisions.\n\nI\u2019m old and have grown up children. I would never put my family at risk by giving a stranger access to a private part of my life, my family mean more to me than that. \n\nOffering help in the moment is wonderful, but putting yourself in a situation where a complete stranger has access to you 24/7 is not.", "Goofy you removed your comment and only thing as a argument is grammar that doesn\u2019t even stand because I type like that knowing it\u2019s wrong", "1- child was not put in danger \n2- she will always have time to spend with her family while she might never be able to help this guy again\n\nYour first point is a fair point", "I didn\u2019t remove any comments??", "I didn\u2019t remove any comments??\n\nEdit: posted twice but will not remove now!", "Her child was not put in danger at the park because the child was with the father. \n\nHer child and her whole family have now been in danger because she has exposed her private life to a complete stranger through fb. \n\nWhat does she know about this guy? Absolutely nothing. He could be a wonderful human being but he could also be an unhinged individual who could potentially become a problem in her life- one that could now very easily find out everything about OP because she has given him access into her personal life. \n\nA wonderful quote by Charles Dickens:\n\u201cPause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.\u201d\n\nI hope the chains that were formed in the park are not of iron or thorns.", "Fair that was me being wrong but my point still stands", "Thats just being extremely paranoid", "NTA. That man was obviously at one of the lowest points in recent times if not all his life. He became a single parent unexpectedly and was struggling. You, having a heart, decided to help him. I feel like your husband is only upset he was a man and your husband wouldn\u2019t be acting weird at all if it had been a woman crying that you had helped.", "YTA If you helped him for a bit, sure, it's nice. 45 minutes on your rare family outing is too much. The Facebook thing is weird too, he's plenty competent to research all of the internet for information or join FB groups with advice instead. \n\nNobody's giving mothers an hour long advice in the park, and they manage just great.", "Never let ANYONE make you feel bad for being a kind person and getting involved. Your husband is pulling an adult tantrum", "NTA\n\nThat was very kind of you.  I would hope anyone would try to help another human out like that, but in reality it\u2019s incredibly rare.  Your husband should admire and be grateful for your kindness.  Not only because that\u2019s the kind of partner anyone would be lucky to have, but because that\u2019s a wonderful attribute to model for your children.  Is it disappointing that he lost a half hour of his family time?  Sure.  But in that moment, that stranger needed you more than your husband did and your husband should recognize that.", "Heroine! So few times in this day and age will someone step up to help a stranger. You're amazing in case you didn't know it!", "NTA. You were just being helpful. Its unfortunate your husband took it as a slight against family time but he needs to remember..you'll always be a family. You could only help that guy in that moment. You did the right thing and no one is hurt for it. I think he may of felt a twinge of territorial jealously over you giving out your facebook but dosent want to admit it because hes sure it's silly. And we just dont always know how to recognize and express  those feelings. \n\nIf it was me I'd try to talk to him about it again and if hes adamant theres no other issues I'd let it go. It's okay to disagree on it.", "NTA \n\nYou helped a parent in need. \nSounds like you got 2 kids.", "The fact that so many people think a woman being nice to someone means she\u2019d date him boggles my mind.", "As my husband or I would say, \"We have our entire lives together. For this person, today could be their breaking point.\". He's the AH. If it hurts their existence to give a little over an hour to someone in pain, they should rethink priorities.", "NTA", "I disagree.  I said the exact same thing.  Someone needed her more in that moment.  If the man\u2019s crisis was physical, he fell down and broke his leg or got hit by a car and she put pressure on his wounds for a half hour until the paramedics came, would that be ok?  There are priorities in life.  Yes, your family comes first overall, but sometimes shit happens and someone needs you more than your family does in that moment.  Not forever, but for a half hour, yeah.  To me, this is the same thing, it was just a mental health crisis instead of a physical one.  Sometimes someone being there for you during a mental health crisis can save your life just as much as if they were putting pressure on a wound.", "Huh?", "If you create opertunity for emotional or physical cheating then it's more likely for things to happen.  Some things are too important to take lightly.  Can't take it back.", "op=NTA\n\nYou appear to have a kind heart.  Hopefully, your husband will get over his disconcertion.", "NTA- you helped someone in crisis. Your husband should be proud of your kindness.", "NTA. My partner is kinda awkward and we have a son that\u2019s starting to get to the tantrum age (had his first lay down scream kick one yesterday) and I\u2019d be happy that a nice lady at the park with her kids helped my partner if my son was throwing down. You weren\u2019t overbearing or being rude about it from what I can tell, just a parent helping another parent. \n\nIdk about your husband, but he needs a chill pill.", "NTA.  Hubby's social awkwardness probably contributed to his reaction.", "Actually she might have saved that kiddos life. The dad was obviously overwhelmed which is when a lot of shaken baby happens. Still considered shaken baby when they are a toddler.", "Not saying it happens all the time and not saying it's just women, If this was a man most people here would have been convinced he was cheating and telling her to divorce him.", "IP, came back and added that long after I wrote my comment.", "OP's edit says she heard HIM crying, not the kid, which is why she went over to help him.", "Why is spending time with your own children being thrown around like some kind of punishment?  \n\nTrying to gender swap parenting situations is weird because it\u2019s already universal (in the sense that any gender, sex. or sexuality can be a parent)\n\nWhy would I be upset that my husband was talking to someone? Helping someone? Am I supposed to be jealous? Is it normal to monopolize someone else\u2019s time so much they can\u2019t possibly go be a good, helpful, kind, compassionate individual to someone else? They can\u2019t acknowledge a mutual struggle?\n\nI do find husband\u2019s behavior antisocial and selfish\n\nNTA", "The husband gets regular outings, so he knows there will be other chances to hang out with his family. I absolutely understand feeling frustrated. But think, what if talking to that single father becomes the difference between him harming himself and/or his child and finding a way through the mess left by the egg donor? Taking the time to sit down and help the single dad could easily be the tipping point. It hopefully means the single dad will find a support network and build relationships in the community, which will benefit everyone. Yes it sucks to lose time with your family, but sometimes you need to consider things outside yourself. I\u2019ve been in situations where having someone reach out to offer a hand prevented me from harming myself. In a second I would do it for someone else."]}
