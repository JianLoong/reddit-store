That's cool, but your husband still has the right to feel sad about missing out on family time with you. You said he works a lot and was probably looking forward to spending some time with the two most important people in his life. 30-45 minutes is a long time to be gone when you just told your husband you'll see if you can help.\n\nMaybe you should have come back after a couple of minutes to tell you husband something like \"Hey, this guy is completely overwhelmed being alone with his kid.

You most certainly didn't give that stranger your profile so you could start having an affair, which makes you thinking it isn't a big deal understandable.\n\nAll in all I'd say just talk to each other. Both of you should try putting yourself in the other's shoes. Speaking from a male perspective, he might feel a bit threatened by the stranger because he is working a lot and feels like he isn't around as much as he thinks he should be and is afraid of you just randomly finding another dude and dumping him.

NTA but I would talk with him on his hangups because he has some kind of baggage you aren't aware of somehow.", "These comments make me laugh. Anyone happy for that partner to leave them and go and talk to someone else for an hour?\n\nNot to involve them in the conversation? To think they have no worthwhile input?", "Yeah, it's not jealousy at all, he's not jealous of that guy, he's just upset that he wanted a nice walk in the park with his family, but then OP decided to put that on pause for 45 minutes.\n\nHe's not an asshole for being upset about that,imo.", "100% right.  In that scenario the husband would be the \"white knight\" or \"captain save a __\".\n\nJust to help out some pretty young thing, forgetting about his family for the better part of an hour, giving out his social media.\n\nHe'd be scorched.", "I understand helping in a special situation. But giving out facebook information makes it a longer commitment i would not be happy about. If it was just for questions about parenting groups,ok bur in op's words 'to vent'...", "Absolutely", "My bigger thing is that she assumed he needed help with the toddler melt down.  I'm willing to bet she wouldn't have assumed that a woman wouldn't need the  help.\n\nToddlers melt down all the time,  I can tell I certainly wouldn't have appreciated some busybody butting in when I was dealing with a toddler meltdown.", "I don't see insecurity here. I see op helping someone at expense of his own rare family time, which would not be too bad if it was a one time thing. But also giving out contact info so a stranger can vent is something different and makes it a commitment.", "And she ends it with her giving him her Facebook ( = to a phone number in today's world) so they could hook-up...I mean talk later) I think she really spent 45 minutes flirting with another man.", "They absorb more of what\u2019s happening around them than you would think. ESPECIALLY if it is their primary caregiver doing it.", "Came here to say this. YTA for inserting yourself into that situation and for abandoning your family for 45 minutes.", "As someone who works to support a family as the sole earner I highly value any time I get to spend with my wife and kids even if it\u2019s only for a few minute let alone a day at the park. Part of if not my main role for my family is providing for them financially as it sounds with this guy. I work those extra hours so my wife does not have to and we don\u2019t have to pay for someone else to raise our kids while we both work. I\u2019m not sure what country you live in but in the US most peoples children are raised by daycare providers as it generally takes two people earning to support a family.\n\nOnly on Reddit will you see someone saying a father who took the time to go out and spend time with his family at the park being a bit upset when his wife spends that time with another man is the husbands fault and he needs to rethink his role as a father. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sure how old you are or if you have ever been in a real relationship but I\u2019m guessing not. I know my wife would be a bit upset if the roles were reversed and I spent our time together with another women and got her contact info after but maybe we just both value our time together that much.", "This comment should go straight to the top!", "So in your example, wouldn't it have been better for the Op to involve her husband in the chat.", "It would be strange to have an assumption that is not presumptuous.", "Regardless of how long the entire outing was, I think making your husband sit and wait there for 45 minutes to be an ~~asshole~~ move anyway.\n\nOr, actually, on second thought, it's not an asshole move, but neither is the husband being upset about it.", "I'm guessing OP's husband also has mixed feeling about it. in one hand he understands the wife just helps the other guy but on the other hand perhaps he's jealous. not necessarily a complete lack of empathy to me, human's feeling is just that complex sometimes.", "Because a park outing with a toddler is going to last 1.5hr or so. Toddlers get bored, tired, hungry. \n\nYou really like to hear yourself talk huh?", "Given you are referring to class periods you are clearly in high school. Time becomes much more precious when you are an adult with a kid and a job. You don't have hours to fritter away daily anymore.\n\n45min is a long time on a park outing that for a toddler is going to last 1.5-2hrs max. Kids this age need their regular naps.", "Having no empathy lol, dude was just upset cos he wanted to spend time with his family which rarely happens, and it's an accurate assumption cos most families go to parks for 1-2 hours", "You sound really insecure.", "Yes but it is fun to say.", "We used to take our toddler to the park for several hours. She was happy playing, would have kept going for longer if we let her! Toddlers don't need feeding every two hours, either!\n\nOf course, our toddler is not all toddlers, but neither is OP's. You can't treat them all the same.", "It seems like that student is more perceptive than you. I saw zero empathy and jealous behavior from the father, major red flags. I would be appalled if my husband ever got upset with me for taking time away from us to help another. Time is valuable, and anyone who thinks that time is wasted on helping another in need, is an awful person in my books.", "Not insecure, just a realist."]}
