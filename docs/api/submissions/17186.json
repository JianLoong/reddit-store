NTA, but I think you should have a serious conversation with your husband about his behavior. It was wildly inappropriate.", "NTA. You sure about this guy?

He needs to grow up.", "NTA!\n\nYes he may he having a bad day but that gave him no right to unload on a person half his age like that. Not to mention, he called a 4 year old little a \"little sh*t\". I'd have verbally dragged him through the sand for that one.\n\nNo matter how awful a day he was having that gave him no cause to treat two children as if they were his cause for having a bad day because of some other reason.\n\nSht may run downhill fast, but that was uncalled for.\n\n\nAlso, his \"friends\" are a$$holes for teasing him.", "NTA!!\n\nYelling at a 3 year old and 14 year old surely is a great way to relieve stress I presume? You did the right thing.  Do childish things face childish consequences. And he left you alone and when you came back with your friend he gave you the silent treatment? Toxic enough? He's clearly a child in an adult body idk what delusion he's facing. My advice, if it happens again find someone mature and leave him. He did that with an unknown child with no parents around and it was clearly an accident. Do you think if you weren't there he would have held back? I wouldn't want to know what'll happen if you guys have an actual kid someday. Would he yell and scream at his kid everyday because of work stress? Who knows? He clearly doesn't :)", "He embarrassed himself by losing his temper over an accident.\n\nHe embarrassed himself by screaming at children verbally abusing them because of an accident that had physically hurt no one and caused no damage.\n\nHe had no right to treat children this way to the point where a 3 year old was cowering behind her older brother because she was frightened of your husbands.\n\nYou stepped in because his behaviour was wrong, to protect two children when he was not justified in his actions towards them.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he is stressed overworked ect that is no excuse for him to take out his emotions on others, especially when no of that is their fault.\n\nIf he is that willing to unload on strangers on children, how long before he does the same to you or your children, how long before that kind of toxic behaviour escalates to physical abuse when he has a lot on his plate?\n\nHe needs to go on an anger management course and therapy so he can figure out how to process his emotions in a healthy manner and not treat others as an emotional punching bag.\n\nNTA If a person can't tell their partner that their actions and behaviour are wrong, who can?", "NTA\n\nBut, if you want children your husband is showing you loud and clear how he will treat them.  It may be he can't manage stress, sure, but my first thought is was this how your husband was treated as a child?

He was not hurt. Fortunately, the children were not hurt. He was totally in the wrong and it was right of you to confront him there and then.", "If your partner is being a jerk, it is supporting to call them out. You are supporting them being a better person.", "Right? OP, your husband *is* a child! Cussing out a 14 year old for a small child\u2019s mistake!? Abandoning you for calling him out? Then giving you the silent treatment? Stop making excuses for him. That\u2019s incredibly childish behavior all around. NTA", "\"he's stressed\" due to work!? Like 'ok? ' that's part of life and being an adult. Is he so special that he's the only one stressed about work and life (sarcasm). Now he's trying to gaslight the OP about what happened. Use some emotional intelligence and coping skills. You're at the beach go take a dip in the ocean, cool off take a deep breath, and just be.", "I'm sorry I meant I bet you can't wait to have kids with this lovely guy", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

And it seems like this grown ass man made both the teenager and the toddler extremely uncomfortable, on the edge of tears, with his over the top behavior.", "Haha what did you expect to see happen?  I resented her for a while even though the school sided with me and punished the other girl for lying.  It was a tough pill to swallow but looking back, her tough love was valuable.  I learned the importance of CYA and not relying on others to come save me.", "Thinking of the 14 yo taking care of the little one gets me emotional. I hope it was just some babysitting involved and the kids are fine, but I recognise this as my personal bias. Still, your husband's behaviour was uncalled and exaggerated. He was lashing out on them, bulling them, a full grown adult. You did what you had to do. Please consider others comments like u/_lavender  's", "Those children may have also been even younger than they looked. My newly four year old has been assumed to be 6 by strangers for a bit now because\u2026 she\u2019s the height of a six year old. I was taller in second grade than my teacher. I reached my adult height of 5\u20199.5\u201d at age 12. Tall kids routinely get treated as older than they are. He might have been yelling at a 2 year old and a 14 year old."]}
