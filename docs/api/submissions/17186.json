You did the right thing.  Do childish things face childish consequences. And he left you alone and when you came back with your friend he gave you the silent treatment? Toxic enough? He's clearly a child in an adult body idk what delusion he's facing. My advice, if it happens again find someone mature and leave him. He did that with an unknown child with no parents around and it was clearly an accident. Do you think if you weren't there he would have held back? I wouldn't want to know what'll happen if you guys have an actual kid someday. Would he yell and scream at his kid everyday because of work stress? Who knows? He clearly doesn't :)", "He embarrassed himself by losing his temper over an accident.\n\nHe embarrassed himself by screaming at children verbally abusing them because of an accident that had physically hurt no one and caused no damage.\n\nHe had no right to treat children this way to the point where a 3 year old was cowering behind her older brother because she was frightened of your husbands.\n\nYou stepped in because his behaviour was wrong, to protect two children when he was not justified in his actions towards them.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he is stressed overworked ect that is no excuse for him to take out his emotions on others, especially when no of that is their fault.\n\nIf he is that willing to unload on strangers on children, how long before he does the same to you or your children, how long before that kind of toxic behaviour escalates to physical abuse when he has a lot on his plate?\n\nHe needs to go on an anger management course and therapy so he can figure out how to process his emotions in a healthy manner and not treat others as an emotional punching bag.\n\nNTA If a person can't tell their partner that their actions and behaviour are wrong, who can?", "NTA\n\nBut, if you want children your husband is showing you loud and clear how he will treat them.

He's lucky the \"little shit\" didn't have a father around or he may have been picking his teeth up out of the sand.", "nta, your husband was being an asshole to a kid. end of story. how tf can\u2019t he see that?", "He\u2019s waving all the red flags of abusive spouses, GET OUT of there!!!\n\nNTA", "NTA. He embarrassed himself.", "Also, kinda YTA, because why not buy the sister a new ice cream. The older brother was obviously put in a tough position by the adults in his own life.\n\nAlso, a grown adult yelling a a kid, another YTA for offering excuses for his behavior. We've all had bad and stressful days at work and don't yell at literal children, or at the very least show some humanity when called out on this type of bad behavior.", "He isn\u2019t always this bad\u2026", "Even if he had an obligation to or authority over them, calling a 3-year-old that was too much.  Calling her big brother, who was doing his best to deal with her, an idiot was also not necessary.  I'd be worried about how he'd treat his own kids. NTA, but your husband is one that can't be helped by all the Preparation H in the world.", "Not a chance. He found an easy punching bag. That's what abusive assholes do.  No way he would have reacted that way to a grown man.", "Your husband should be ashamed of himself, whereas you did everything well. NTA and have another chat with him.", "Exactly right he would have been too much of a coward for that.", "Actually she should get angry about him leaving her behind. You just don't do that.\n\nNTA", "Oh wow yeah he actually does this whenever he\u2019s mad at me which isn\u2019t often but yeah. Sometimes he\u2019ll leave me for hours so I\u2019ll call a friend and the second I get home he\u2019d get mad again and say that he was coming to get me and I shouldn\u2019t have called whichever friend it was to pick me up. These comments have been eye opening and honestly, I have no idea how I ended up in this situation.", "Very true. Even if friends had been clearly, unmistakably mocking him personally for being an unspeakable chode, this would have translated into OP's \"fault\" in AH-ese.", "Babe, please get out. I stuck with my dude for another 9 years (10 years total) after he started doing all of this and I massively regret it. A whole decade of my life I can't get back. Ages 23-33, gone. I should have been happy and figuring my life out, but nope. I went into therapy for another 3 years after that to undo all the training he did to my brain. I've met a great guy now who treats me well and handles my trauma responses with grace. You deserve better. \n\nIt won't get better. It just gets worse. Just because it isn't physical doesn't mean it isn't abuse. In fact, sometimes I wish my ex had just hit me. It would have been easier to deal with than the mindfucks", "Please don\u2019t blame yourself! It\u2019s not always obvious when you\u2019re in the situation and you love the person. \n\nNow that you\u2019re reading these, and becoming aware of all the red flags, just take a real good hard look at the life you want.", "Which is why, sometimes, you have to gently introduce hypothetical situations to ease people into realizing just how far from \"normal\" they've allowed their assessment of their partner to creep.\n\nOP is obviously not able to see her partner the way the rest of us clearly do.  If I can add just a little bit of doubt to her mind, maybe it will be the crack into which reality will seep, and freeze, and break open her currently blindness to her partner's behaviors.", "I remember once I was out with my little nephew, who was 3, to see santa claus. While in the very long line, I got my pocket picked. Probably because I was distracted by watching a 3 year old.\n\nAnyway, I was stressed out and I snapped at my nephew. For the first time in his little life, he looked afraid of me. That snapped me right out of it and I immediately apologised and explained that it wasn't his fault and I was wrong to yell at him. I told him it is never OK to act like that and I was sorry.\n\nWhen people snap because they're stressed, a decent person realises right away that they are taking it out on the wrong person and stops.\n\nOP's husband didn't stop. He kept berating that poor child, calling him names and not only didn't stop when called out but is still mad, days later, that his wife didn't pile on to that child. \n\nThe only support he should have expected was MAYBE to help him clean up, but not to support his terrible behaviour. As soon as that kid became afraid of him, he should have realised he went too far. That he didn't is a huge red flag. I hope OP is not trying to have a child with this guy because anytime he's stressed, any mistake that child makes will ne an excuse to abuse him or her.", "Why?", "NTA but your husband is TA for taking his stress out on a kid whose charge accidentally got I e cream on him.\n\nYou embarrassed him? What about him embarrassing you?", "NTA.\n \nThey're children. The one who got ice cream on him is very young. The older one isn't old enough that you could expect them to handle a younger child well. A simple \"you guys need to be careful\" is about all the situation would have warranted.\n \nI'm not perfect. I've lost my shit on people for relatively minor things just because I'd reached the limits of my tolerance that day. I've never felt justified in doing so after the fact. I've never asked my wife to \"support me no matter what\". If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. When you're in public with other people, shit happens. When you're around kids, shit happens even more. It's one of the things you have to accept about living in society with other people. Not everybody acts perfectly all the time, kids even less so.\n \nHe can't just be so emotionally reactive that he's out there screaming at kids and calling them shits. Is he the guy punching people at the bar over a spilled drink? Learning how to think before acting and overcoming your initial emotional responses is like step 1 to becoming anything other than an insufferable asshole. Understanding that your personal circumstances has fuck all to do with anything else and that you don't get a pass for bad behavior just because you're stressed and tired is step 2.", "NTA. If he doesn't want to be treated like a child he shouldn't throw a tantrum like one lmao", "NTA. Please make them an ex boyfriend. It won\u2019t be long until he\u2019s treating you this way if he isn\u2019t already", "NTA.\n\nMaybe if he didn't act like a child, you wouldn't have to treat him like one.", "NTA, and I want you to really think hard about this. You defended your husband from bullying a child who was clearly trying to deal with something he was too young for. Your husband acted abusively towards both the child and you for leaving you there. He thinks you should always support him then what does he say about what he did to you in front of the friends? \n\nYou are also excusing a portion of your husbands embarrassing and abusive behavior by him being stressed but it\u2019s not an excuse to behave this way. He clearly has anger management issues and I do hope you are ok. It sounds to me like you are in an abusive relationship.", "I\u2019m stressed about literally everything and yet I don\u2019t yell at toddlers. \n\nNTA but your husband sure is. He bullied and verbally abused children. That\u2019d be an instant dealbreaker for me.", "You treated him like a child cause he had a tantrum like a toddler! \nHe's a bully. He saw no problem with yelling at children while they were crying because he was stressed and embarrassed. He now wants to dominate and control you and will mentally abuse you till he gets his way. Time to leave.", "Nta - his friends made fun of you for scolding him but, said nothing of his freaking out on a kid who made a mistake and apologized?  Stressed or not, he\u2019s the  ass.", "NTA. Your husband sounds unhinged. There is no acceptable reason for shouting at a child you dont even know or calling a 3 year old girl a 'little shit'. Honestly I would reevaluate whether this is the kind of person you want to be with. I certainly wouldn't.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is a dick.", "NTA. Your husband, a grown man, overreacted and was yelling and cursing at a literal child. He should be deeply ashamed of his godawful behaviour. The fact he can\u2019t realize this on his own is disturbing to say the least. I hope for your sake he comes to his senses.", "NTA\u2014\u2014you embarrassed him in front of children because he was acting like one\u2014-the leaving you with out a ride is a huge red flag", "A person\u2019s true nature often comes out in how they act when no one is watching.  It\u2019s worse because you were watching and that still didn\u2019t slow him down.", "Your husband is not just the asshole,  but an asshole I'm general. That's fucked up behaviour regardless of how stressed he is.", "NTA. Your husband was acting like a spoiled child. I don't care what kind of week he'd had or how stressed he was - he was yelling at a 14 year old CHILD. You don't need to support idiocy.", "NTA, and his behavior in this situation makes me wonder, is he also verbally abusive with you?", "NTA.\n\nAnd it's a bit outside the scope of your question, but If you are considering having children with your husband, I would reread this story and replace the words \"the boy\" and \"the girl\" with our son and our daughter. Because if this is an example of how he lashes out when children are difficult, it's probably worth looking into the future for that.", "NTA you're husband was acting childish, you react to children as such.", "Like how the asshole husband was barking orders at that child that didn't deserve it, gtfoh \n\nNTA op", "Considering how your partner just acted at those children and continues to act now i'm not sure i WOULD trust my partner in your shoes.", "Isn\u2019t always this bad? Which is the same as saying that he\u2019s sometimes this bad. Look at it that way. If it was a one off then maybe; but you need to have a serious talk.", "Look up the cycle of abuse. If it was always this bad, you\u2019d leave. They don\u2019t want you to get away. What they want is you walking on eggshells and hopping to take of them and their moods. \n\nSo usually they\u2019ll start out amazing. Kind, thoughtful, everything you could want. You\u2019re head over heels. You can\u2019t believe your luck. \n\nThen it starts subtly. You did something wrong. They\u2019re disappointed. They\u2019re frustrated. They\u2019re stressed. They\u2019re moody. You don\u2019t listen. You don\u2019t think things through. You\u2019re careless. \n\nThen it builds until they snap. They yell. They swear. They storm off. They slam doors. Silent treatment. You\u2019re selfish. You\u2019re an idiot. You shouldn\u2019t have done that. You should have known. You crying or being upset is manipulative. It\u2019s all your fault. \n\nThen they\u2019re sorry. It won\u2019t happen again. They were stressed. They missed lunch and their blood sugar was low. Somebody else caused it. They love you. They can\u2019t live without you. Flowers. Date nights. Romance. \n\nThen the cycle repeats, over and over. And each time, the cycle gets just a little bit worse. The honeymoon phase is shorter. The walking on eggshells starts sooner. The eventual blow up is nastier. But the cycle keeps you in place. Just as you\u2019re starting to pull away or question the relationship, the person you fell in love with will come back. And the cycle will continue. \n\nRead up on both the cycle of abuse and on the power and control wheel (read in a way that he can\u2019t find out). There\u2019s also a great book called \u201cWhy does he do that\u201d which you can get as a free PDF. Notice if there are any other ways he subtly controls or limits you, or punishes you for stepping out of line. Take a look at your whole relationship as if your sister told you this is how her husband behaves. \n\nNot always being this bad is an essential part of his process.", "His behavior was appalling.  There is NO excuse to verbally eviscerate a teenager caring for a small child in that situation. None.  You did the right thing by intervening, but you should not be making excuses for your husband. \n\nYou are NTA, but your husband is horrendous.  Good luck to you.", "Well, I would think that would also be included in the embarrassing her at the beach. It's was a very childish and irresponsible thing to do, but yes I agree OP should be the one upset and for multiple reasons.", "Double up on birth control. Trust me, kids are hard on the most kind, even-keeled person. A guy who is going to berate a stranger\u2019s three year old for an accident will do permanent damage to your own kids.", "You're absolutely right and from experience, even knowing the age of the kid, if the present older, it's really hard to remember they are younger than they look and their behaviour is relative. It's difficult even when you acknowledge your bias", "Or anyone really", "Also the correct answer"]}
