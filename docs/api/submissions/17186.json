After a while it was perfectly clear to me that he was just yelling at the kid cause he was an easy target.

How is he going to act when his own toddler does the same thing? I bet I know: he\u2019ll be yelling at you the same way he was yelling at that poor kid who was probably doing the best he could. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso, and I hate to go there but you guys need to talk. It\u2019s not ok that he got into a shouting match with a child (if the kids\u2019 parents had turned up this could have gone very bad, very quickly) and when you controlled the situation he abandoned you on the beach and still keeps insisting that he was right. This is a sign. Not a good one.", "NTA - You didn't embarrass your husband, he embarrassed himself by loosing his cool over ice cream.", "Think long and hard before even thinking about having kids. I don't care how difficult or demanding or stressful his job is. There was no reason to speak to those children like that. And, if his friends agree with him, then you seriously need to look at your marriage. I'm not trying to be mean. You seem level-headed so please do some hard thinking about your relationship. \n\nDefinitely  NTA but your husband is!", "NTA\n\nI do not agree that anyone should support their spouse when they are verbally abusing someone, especially a child.\n\nHe then stranded you and gave you the silent treatment, all because you stood up for a kid who didn\u2019t deserve how he was being treated.\n\nAnd why is it that standing up for a kid means you are treating your husband like a child? Does he think if he intervened on someone else\u2019s behalf that he\u2019s be treating someone like a child? Or is that framing just reserved for you, his wife?", "NTA. God that was such a jackass move on your husband\u2019s part. Who yells at a kid for an honest mistake. Good on you for calling him out on it. What bs about supporting your partner even if they\u2019re wrong.", "NTA - if he doesn\u2019t want to be treated like a child, he shouldn\u2019t act like one. Simple.", "NTA OP.  Your husband was being a jerk to those kids, and you called him out on it.", "NTA your husband sounds exactly how you treated him, a child.", "NTA The children were acting more mature than he was. He needs to grow up.", "So your husband verbally attacked a 14 year old, scared a 3 year old and called her a little shit, abandoned you and gave you the silent treatment. Are there any redeeming qualities about your husband? NTA", "NTA. Genuinely your husband sounds like an absolute wanker.", "NTA- he was embarrassed by that but not by yelling at a child and calling them an idiot for an honest mistake?", "> I embarrassed him and he can\u2019t believe I did all that in front of everyone\n\nNTA. He embarrassed himself.  He called a 3 year old a \u201clittle shit\u201d.  \n\nHis reaction is so freaking over the top. Is he normally this angry? Does he normally lash out like this?", "What's embarrassing here is not how you acted, but how he couldn't control himself and needed you so step in.", "I just want to cry picturing how upset that boy and little girl would have been. That\u2019s scarring. NTA for sure. You did the right thing raining him in. And as someone who at 14 used to get abused by older men with a chip on their shoulder while I worked at McDonalds just because I was an easy target don\u2019t let him get away with that rubbish.", "It being embarrassing doesn\u2019t make you in the wrong.

The boy seemed to be less scared, more pissed off and while I\u2019m glad the situation didn\u2019t escalate, I wonder if I should\u2019ve let the kid yell at my husband. Probably not, he would\u2019ve thrown an even bigger fuss. I just can\u2019t handle when people, no matter who they are, are mean to kids. \n\nI\u2019m also sorry about your experiences, god do people suck.", "he deserved to be embarassed. he shouted abuse at two children who had not actually done anything wrong. he let his emotional immaturity\u2014aka not being able to process the stress of his job like an adult\u2014get the better of him and went into angry hysterics. \n\nof course he\u2019s mad at you. you behaved like and adult, and reminded him that he isn\u2019t one. of course he and his friends think you\u2019re in the wrong. they\u2019re the type to believe a wife\u2019s job is to constantly tend to her husband\u2019s fragile emotions and make him feel like a big threatening manly man.\n\nyou\u2019re NTA. but I really, really hope you aren\u2019t planning on starting a family with this man, because he will absolutely do this to his own children too.", "NTA he had already embarrassed himself by shouting at people in public and referring to a toddler as a little shit", "A normal, healthy reaction from an adult in such a situation is to try to console the child (or in this case, both children). I would expect that most adults would at LEAST do that, if not more - personally I'd go so far as to find something to distract the younger child with, whether that be replacing the ice cream, or whatever was available.\n\nI do not believe that being stressed at work is an adequate excuse for behaving in such a way. NTA, but I think you should have a serious conversation with your husband about his behavior. It was wildly inappropriate.", "NTA. You sure about this guy? Yelling at a child like that, calling him an 'idiot'...eek.", "NTA, and stressed or not, your husband's reaction was over the top and wrong.  And then to leave you stranded and then the silent treatment? Major red flags.", "Your husband is the asshole here...if he got this upset at a stranger...whats he going to be like with your own kids...when he's stressed...girl open your eyes", "Lol dudes at the beach and mistakenly gets ice cream on him?  Just wash off in the water", "NTA. Act like a child, get treated like one. Calling out in surprise and telling the girl\u2019s older brother to be more careful in watching his sister was reasonable. Swearing, keeping on yelling, creating a scene, flouncing off in a huff and leaving you stranded- no. He needs to grow up.", "NTA!\n\nYes he may he having a bad day but that gave him no right to unload on a person half his age like that. Not to mention, he called a 4 year old little a \"little sh*t\". I'd have verbally dragged him through the sand for that one.\n\nNo matter how awful a day he was having that gave him no cause to treat two children as if they were his cause for having a bad day because of some other reason.\n\nSht may run downhill fast, but that was uncalled for.\n\n\nAlso, his \"friends\" are a$$holes for teasing him.", "NTA!!\n\nYelling at a 3 year old and 14 year old surely is a great way to relieve stress I presume? You did the right thing.  Do childish things face childish consequences. And he left you alone and when you came back with your friend he gave you the silent treatment? Toxic enough? He's clearly a child in an adult body idk what delusion he's facing. My advice, if it happens again find someone mature and leave him. He did that with an unknown child with no parents around and it was clearly an accident. Do you think if you weren't there he would have held back? I wouldn't want to know what'll happen if you guys have an actual kid someday. Would he yell and scream at his kid everyday because of work stress? Who knows? He clearly doesn't :)", "He embarrassed himself by losing his temper over an accident.\n\nHe embarrassed himself by screaming at children verbally abusing them because of an accident that had physically hurt no one and caused no damage.\n\nHe had no right to treat children this way to the point where a 3 year old was cowering behind her older brother because she was frightened of your husbands.\n\nYou stepped in because his behaviour was wrong, to protect two children when he was not justified in his actions towards them.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he is stressed overworked ect that is no excuse for him to take out his emotions on others, especially when no of that is their fault.\n\nIf he is that willing to unload on strangers on children, how long before he does the same to you or your children, how long before that kind of toxic behaviour escalates to physical abuse when he has a lot on his plate?\n\nHe needs to go on an anger management course and therapy so he can figure out how to process his emotions in a healthy manner and not treat others as an emotional punching bag.\n\nNTA If a person can't tell their partner that their actions and behaviour are wrong, who can?", "NTA\n\nBut, if you want children your husband is showing you loud and clear how he will treat them.  It may be he can't manage stress, sure, but my first thought is was this how your husband was treated as a child?  Is your husband just copying the behavior of his own father?", "NTA. \n\nHe sounds like an abusive f*ck.  \nI hope you dont have children because that will make the divorce, for your own safety, messy.", "NTA. Any reasonable person would want their partner to call them out when they've crossed a line. He clearly crossed a line by yelling at that boy.", "YTA for marrying a 14 year old. Oh wait, he\u2019s 26?  Could have fooled me.", "Nta, I'd have called him out too , he was being a Jack ass to that kid.", "He acted like a child, what he expect?", "NTA. Your husband needs to get a grip.", "My husband and I are in super stressful hubs and would never yell at someone over a stupid ice cream accident. NTA. Please do not have any children with this man.", "I agree. Its a good partners job to call out their SO on their bullshit when they don\u2019t see it themselves.\n\nProps to the brother for handling the situation better than the grown adult.", "It needs to be asked. OP, are you planning on having children with this man? Because if you are, you\u2019ve just seen how he treats children. You\u2019ve seen how he responds to a small inconvenience. You\u2019ve seen how he treats you the moment you don\u2019t conform to his expectations. Are you happy with who this man is?", "Do you have any evidence that his friends thought it was embarrassing? Did he tell you which friends? \n\nI think, just like with the ice cream and the kid, he's just using his friends as an excuse to take his bad mood out on you, make you doubt yourself, and punish you for your \"disloyalty\".", "It was embarrassing to be told to behave, but he wasn't embarrassed yelling at a child over spilled icecream? \nWhat are his priorities, hmm?", "Please don\u2019t have kids with him until he solves this character flaw. Abusing children because you\u2019re stressed is absolutely abhorrent.", "If he doesn\u2019t want to be scolded like a child then he shouldn\u2019t be acting like one. He was having just as much of a tantrum as the girl who dropped her ice cream was.\nMaybe he needs his binky and a little nap.", "Dude could be lying about what his friends said too. They might have been mocking him about needing to be scolded because he was acting more like a child than the actual child in the situation. He could have spun that in his abusive, narcissistic mind into whatever lie he told her. She didn't hear it from his friends directly.", "Reining in, like stopping a horse with the reins.", "If you don\u2019t have kids yet, please take some time to meditate on this and observe your husband in future periods of significant stress. This happened on a relaxing beach day with friends (regardless of how stressed he was at work during the week or whatever) - how\u2019s he going to react after 14 consecutive nights of interrupted sleep and 2am feedings?"]}
