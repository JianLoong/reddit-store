We were having fun.\n\nThere was a teenage boy, maybe 14? And what seemed to be a 3 year old girl. They were on their own and also seemed to be having fun. \n\nThe little girl started crying after a while though and the boy got her an ice cream. She was still upset, ran from the boy\u2019s arms and accidentally got the ice cream all over my husband who was in her way.\n\nIt was a complete accident and the boy looked like he wanted to cry. I immediately went over to my husband who had yelled in surprise and helped him out. The boy had grabbed his sister and was apologizing but my husband snapped at him and told him to watch the little shit more carefully. \n\nMy husband\u2019s been stressed because of his job and it was his first relaxing day so I can totally understand feeling like shit. But he\u2019s a kid, clearly not her parent. \n\nI told my husband to just let it go but he ignored me and kept yelling at the kid, calling him an idiot, and other things. The boy looked like he was gonna say something back so I loudly told my husband that he\u2019s said enough. I then told the boy that we all make mistakes and gave him some tips on how to get his sister to calm down. He thanked me, made a face at my husband then him and his sister packed up and left. \n\nMy husband was clearly upset and told me that he was going home. He left without me and a friend had to drive me instead. He then gave me the silent treatment until a couple hours ago and apparently I embarrassed him and he can\u2019t believe I did all that in front of everyone. He insists that even if he was doing something wrong, I have to support him as his wife and apparently his friends made a joke about me \u201cscolding\u201d him and treating him like a child\u2026 in front of and instead of the actual children.

What he did was completely wrong, does he plan on screaming at your kids if they accidentally make a mess?", "Uh no, your husband is an asshole here. Pretty cut and dry case. NTA.", "NTA at all. He says you embarrassed him but I think he more than embarrassed himself! Who would treat a child that way?! He needs to grow up and learn some patience, hopefully that happens before you ever have children of your own.", "NTA, but your husband is. Sounds pretty clearly like an accident. I can't imagine he'd have reacted like that if the kid was a grown man and not 14.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA...he was screaming to some kids that it's not even his and for what? For an accident. You did the right thing interfering. If the parents were around he could be in so much trouble for yelling at them. And them he left you alone because he was mad that you were protecting them?! Well I will say that even that you didn't treat him like a minor, he shouldn't act like one.", "For a guy wanting a united front, he left you at the beach.

It doesn't matter if it's his job or if he's stressed, you don't act like that toward people.    \n\n\nHe embarrassed himself, you didn't embarrass him.  He threw a temper tantrum like a toddler.", "NTA. Your husband embarrassed himself yelling at a child caring for a much younger child. That was inappropriate and you are not obligated to support that behavior. \n\nYour husband and the friends sound immature.", "NTA.  He acted like a cranky toddler, you treated him like a cranky toddler.  If he didn't like the look, he shouldn't have worn it.  End of story.", "NTA- who screams insults at children? Accidents happen and you\u2019re at the beach so rinse off and move on with your day. He threw a hissy like a child and then got mad at being treated like a tantruming child? Hell no.

Personally, I would be embarrassed of my husband acting this way.", "NTA.  Well, he was acting like a child.  And a petulant one at that by abandoning you at the beach.  He should be apologizing to you, and to those kids. Stress is not an excuse to lash out.

Does he really think you should support him no matter what he's done? Is that the attitude he has towards his family and friends? I find that really off. Like what if he'd smacked the boy, would he still expect your support? Yeah nah.", "Girl, he\u2019s TA\u2026you are def NTA. Please drop this guy like a bad habit. anyone who abuses the weak because he\u2019s \u201cstressed\u201d is not going to EVER be a good human, make a good partner and certainly not a good father.

Drop this zero and find a person who would say, honey, it\u2019s ok, look at all that water out there\u2026now I have an excuse to go into the ocean thanks!! or someone who would look at the little girl, smile and then draw a smiley face where the ice cream was.

After a while it was perfectly clear to me that he was just yelling at the kid cause he was an easy target. Taking all his stress and anger out on a kid\u2026 it\u2019s really unbelievable to me that he thinks I\u2019m in the wrong here but seeing as even his friends thought it was embarrassing\u2026 well idk.", "I'd also say you did support him. Supported him from making a further ass of himself", "Lol please don\u2019t let his asshole friends gaslight you into supporting his asshole self. \n\nAnd he left you to get home on your own? Girlll . . .\n\nThis is not good. He unloaded his feelings on two kids - and yes, the toddler got ice cream all over him: newsflash: that\u2019s what toddlers do. How is he going to act when his own toddler does the same thing? I bet I know: he\u2019ll be yelling at you the same way he was yelling at that poor kid who was probably doing the best he could. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso, and I hate to go there but you guys need to talk. It\u2019s not ok that he got into a shouting match with a child (if the kids\u2019 parents had turned up this could have gone very bad, very quickly) and when you controlled the situation he abandoned you on the beach and still keeps insisting that he was right. This is a sign. Not a good one.", "NTA - You didn't embarrass your husband, he embarrassed himself by loosing his cool over ice cream.", "Think long and hard before even thinking about having kids. I don't care how difficult or demanding or stressful his job is. There was no reason to speak to those children like that. And, if his friends agree with him, then you seriously need to look at your marriage. I'm not trying to be mean. You seem level-headed so please do some hard thinking about your relationship. \n\nDefinitely  NTA but your husband is!", "NTA\n\nI do not agree that anyone should support their spouse when they are verbally abusing someone, especially a child.\n\nHe then stranded you and gave you the silent treatment, all because you stood up for a kid who didn\u2019t deserve how he was being treated.\n\nAnd why is it that standing up for a kid means you are treating your husband like a child? Does he think if he intervened on someone else\u2019s behalf that he\u2019s be treating someone like a child? Or is that framing just reserved for you, his wife?", "NTA. God that was such a jackass move on your husband\u2019s part. Who yells at a kid for an honest mistake. Good on you for calling him out on it. What bs about supporting your partner even if they\u2019re wrong.", "NTA - if he doesn\u2019t want to be treated like a child, he shouldn\u2019t act like one. Simple.", "NTA OP.  Your husband was being a jerk to those kids, and you called him out on it.", "NTA your husband sounds exactly how you treated him, a child.", "NTA The children were acting more mature than he was. He needs to grow up.", "So your husband verbally attacked a 14 year old, scared a 3 year old and called her a little shit, abandoned you and gave you the silent treatment. Are there any redeeming qualities about your husband? NTA", "NTA. Genuinely your husband sounds like an absolute wanker.", "NTA- he was embarrassed by that but not by yelling at a child and calling them an idiot for an honest mistake?", "> I embarrassed him and he can\u2019t believe I did all that in front of everyone\n\nNTA. He embarrassed himself.  He called a 3 year old a \u201clittle shit\u201d.  \n\nHis reaction is so freaking over the top. Is he normally this angry? Does he normally lash out like this?", "What's embarrassing here is not how you acted, but how he couldn't control himself and needed you so step in.", "I just want to cry picturing how upset that boy and little girl would have been. That\u2019s scarring. NTA for sure. You did the right thing raining him in. And as someone who at 14 used to get abused by older men with a chip on their shoulder while I worked at McDonalds just because I was an east target don\u2019t let him get away with that rubbish.", "It being embarrassing doesn\u2019t make you in the wrong. NTA.", "I think OP meant that his friends found *him* embarrassing, not her.", "The little girl was already in tears but my husband yelling made it worse and the image of her hiding behind her brother terrified won\u2019t leave my head. The boy seemed to be less scared, more pissed off and while I\u2019m glad the situation didn\u2019t escalate, I wonder if I should\u2019ve let the kid yell at my husband. Probably not, he would\u2019ve thrown an even bigger fuss. I just can\u2019t handle when people, no matter who they are, are mean to kids. \n\nI\u2019m also sorry about your experiences, god do people suck."]}
