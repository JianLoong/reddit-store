We were having fun.\n\nThere was a teenage boy, maybe 14? And what seemed to be a 3 year old girl. They were on their own and also seemed to be having fun. \n\nThe little girl started crying after a while though and the boy got her an ice cream. She was still upset, ran from the boy\u2019s arms and accidentally got the ice cream all over my husband who was in her way.\n\nIt was a complete accident and the boy looked like he wanted to cry. I immediately went over to my husband who had yelled in surprise and helped him out. The boy had grabbed his sister and was apologizing but my husband snapped at him and told him to watch the little shit more carefully. \n\nMy husband\u2019s been stressed because of his job and it was his first relaxing day so I can totally understand feeling like shit. But he\u2019s a kid, clearly not her parent. \n\nI told my husband to just let it go but he ignored me and kept yelling at the kid, calling him an idiot, and other things. The boy looked like he was gonna say something back so I loudly told my husband that he\u2019s said enough. I then told the boy that we all make mistakes and gave him some tips on how to get his sister to calm down. He thanked me, made a face at my husband then him and his sister packed up and left. \n\nMy husband was clearly upset and told me that he was going home. He left without me and a friend had to drive me instead. He then gave me the silent treatment until a couple hours ago and apparently I embarrassed him and he can\u2019t believe I did all that in front of everyone. He insists that even if he was doing something wrong, I have to support him as his wife and apparently his friends made a joke about me \u201cscolding\u201d him and treating him like a child\u2026 in front of and instead of the actual children.

He sounds like a hot head", "NTA And don\u2019t make excuses for him. \u201cOh he\u2019s stressed\u201d, no he\u2019s a baby. What he did was completely wrong, does he plan on screaming at your kids if they accidentally make a mess?", "Uh no, your husband is an asshole here. Pretty cut and dry case. NTA.", "NTA at all. He says you embarrassed him but I think he more than embarrassed himself! Who would treat a child that way?! He needs to grow up and learn some patience, hopefully that happens before you ever have children of your own.", "NTA, but your husband is. Sounds pretty clearly like an accident. I can't imagine he'd have reacted like that if the kid was a grown man and not 14.\n\nEdit: typo", "NTA...he was screaming to some kids that it's not even his and for what? For an accident. You did the right thing interfering. If the parents were around he could be in so much trouble for yelling at them. And them he left you alone because he was mad that you were protecting them?! Well I will say that even that you didn't treat him like a minor, he shouldn't act like one.", "For a guy wanting a united front, he left you at the beach.

It doesn't matter if it's his job or if he's stressed, you don't act like that toward people.    \n\n\nHe embarrassed himself, you didn't embarrass him.  He threw a temper tantrum like a toddler.", "NTA. Your husband embarrassed himself yelling at a child caring for a much younger child. That was inappropriate and you are not obligated to support that behavior. \n\nYour husband and the friends sound immature.", "NTA.  He acted like a cranky toddler, you treated him like a cranky toddler.  If he didn't like the look, he shouldn't have worn it.  End of story.", "NTA- who screams insults at children? Accidents happen and you\u2019re at the beach so rinse off and move on with your day. He threw a hissy like a child and then got mad at being treated like a tantruming child? Hell no.

In the name of those kids, thank you for your intervention.\n\nEven IF it was a good thing to support blindly your partner, that's the case when you got a heated argument in a family reunion or a friend's d\u00eener.\nNot when your putting a tantrum and yelling at random kids for an ice-cream on the beach. Like, come on, go wash out in the sea, and stop terrorising kids. \n\nAnd he... left ? And continue to give the cold shoulder, doesn't see his wrong ? And that's the guy you still love ?", "NTA- You weren't \"scolding\" your husband you just stated that he had said enough and handled the situation before another child was made to cry. If your husband is feeling embarrassed, then he should be because instead of handling the incident with grace he decided to yell at a kid trying to watch a younger sibling. Personally, I would be embarrassed of my husband acting this way.", "NTA.  Well, he was acting like a child.  And a petulant one at that by abandoning you at the beach.  He should be apologizing to you, and to those kids. Stress is not an excuse to lash out. And no, when he is clearly wrong, clearly becoming out of control, you, as a committed partner, should try to to protect him from himself, which you did.", "NTA But this is a clue that you should not have kids with this guy.", "NTA your husband was being completely unreasonable and honestly I'd see him treating kids like this as a MASSIVE red flag", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Please drop this guy like a bad habit. anyone who abuses the weak because he\u2019s \u201cstressed\u201d is not going to EVER be a good human, make a good partner and certainly not a good father.

After a while it was perfectly clear to me that he was just yelling at the kid cause he was an easy target.

Girlll . . .\n\nThis is not good. He unloaded his feelings on two kids - and yes, the toddler got ice cream all over him: newsflash: that\u2019s what toddlers do. How is he going to act when his own toddler does the same thing? I bet I know: he\u2019ll be yelling at you the same way he was yelling at that poor kid who was probably doing the best he could. \n\nNTA\n\nAlso, and I hate to go there but you guys need to talk. It\u2019s not ok that he got into a shouting match with a child (if the kids\u2019 parents had turned up this could have gone very bad, very quickly) and when you controlled the situation he abandoned you on the beach and still keeps insisting that he was right. This is a sign. Not a good one.", "NTA - You didn't embarrass your husband, he embarrassed himself by loosing his cool over ice cream."]}
