If you for sure didn\u2019t want to pay for the wine then you shouldn\u2019t have drunk any.  He is still being a much bigger ass though.  NTA.", "NTA - I\u2019d probably reply and say \u201cwould you be ok if we split the drinks separately? We had 2 glasses out of the 3 bottles, so will pay a 25% of the wine + our cocktails. Sorry I should have said at the time that we didn\u2019t want to drink much wine!\u201d\n\nDid they keep your glasses full?", "I hang out with the kind of people that would order $500 bottles (I never would), and I couldn\u2019t imagine any of them ordering a bottle like that without discussing with table first, establishing if everyone wanted it, or just saying it was on them. It\u2019s bizarre to order that and just assume the table is ok with it. Did they ask about the wine and you approved? Was there any discussion? If there was and you tacitly approved, then it\u2019s on you for not speaking up then. If there wasn\u2019t any discussion, then your friend is kind of TA. But it\u2019s bizarre that you\u2019re good friends and this would come up.", "Definetely always discuss the way you will pay beforehand.   \nHowever in this case i think you\u2019re right to call him out because 2 glasses for 1,5 bottles is ridiculous..", " NTA.  Sounds like you have two choices - bring up the disparity and only pay the smaller amount or pay half and probably stop dining out with them because that's a ridiculous assumption on their part.", "NTA I would just send back dude I\u2019m not paying $706 for two glasses of wine. You should have picked cheaper wine or discussed the price with us.\n\nHowever you do owe them at least $280 for dinner. Round it up to $300 to cover drinks. ( no idea if tipping is needed, not sure what country you\u2019re in.)", "With wines that expensive he really should ask. A bottle that\u2019s $50 different matter one that\u2019s $400 is a different league. However you should really have checked and just said at the time not for me to rich for my taste.", "ESH. You should have handled your part of the bill at the restaurant and hashed it out there rather than letting him pay and then dictate your share. This could have been avoided. \n\nAlso, it sounds like your half of the bill outside of the wine was about $300. So paying another $100 for your part of the wine isn\u2019t THAT big of a deal. I would offer to pay for your food and cocktails, but then if he pushes back, I\u2019d give him the money for your portion of the wine (not half). \n\nIf this is one of your best friends, just ASK them\nAbout it!!", "ESH. Maybe it's because I'm not rich, but when I'm out with friends, I always manage expectations by saying how much I'll be able to contribute.  Also,  you and your wife had half a glass of wine only out of the first two bottles? I would not have done that at all, so you could at least say nope, we're not playing for the wine.  Your perception of a half glass could be off. I'd have to see for myself.", "Why didnt you say anything at the time?", "YTA\n\nThe wine was clearly the most expensive part of the meal, you had three chances to deny the wine. If you wanted to try it, no harm in asking for a taste, then at that point the expectation is the wine is theirs. Where they are in the wrong is never talking about it in the first place, \"are you okay with us ordering this expensive wine for the table?\" If they did ask that, the blame falls solely on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It happens. When ordering $840 worth of wine I would always check thoroughly if the other guests want that wine, want to share. Not just order four glasses when they're drinking a cocktail. \n\nBut If I was you, I would have said when he ordered four glasses \"I'm sorry but we're drinking cocktails, we don't fancy wines this night\". \n\nThere was also the moment when you saw the bill that you potentially could have said \"I'm sorry but that is an awful lot of money and we only had four half glasses of wine - I would really appreciate it if we only had to pay 25% of the wine.\". Would suck but still better for everyone than sucking it up initially but wanting to change it when you get home.\n\nBut then again, if I had ordered $840 of wine and the bill came, and I had seen that the other side had hardly drank any wine, I would propose to pay for the wines. Hell, after the first bottle I would have checked in \"you guys only drank two half glasses, I'd like some more wine, do you want to join in or are you good?\". \n\nAgain, assuming neither side did this out of ill intentions, this is just lack of clear communication. \n\nNow on current stance: I would pay the Venmo and don't go out to dinner with them again. If they ask why, I would answer honestly that there are no ill feelings but that the evening was too expensive for your liking. If they don't understand that, that's their problem. Not yours.", "ESH you had several opportunities not to have any of the wine.  But you can say we only had a quarter of the wine or only send back what you think you\u2019re responsible for.", "ESH, kinda. I can\u2019t imagine selecting such expensive bottles and then expecting anyone else to pay for them without a conversation first. That\u2019s insane unless all of you are extremely wealthy. \n\nOn the other hand, you could have checked the prices before indulging or simply stuck to cocktails. You\u2019re less of TA though.", "NTA I would remind the friend that you didn't order the bottles. If the friend wants payment then tell him you will pay for what you drank. Tell him he can be upset however did he seriously think you guys would cover his drinking habit. Also next time in a setting like that and out to dinner with anyone discuss payment beforehand.", "NTA but I\u2019d probably pay the bill and then stop dining with this couple. Or if you enjoy their company, ask for separate checks at the beginning of the next meal.", "ESH, him for expecting you to pay for wine you didn\u2019t drink. But also you for not speaking up and declining multiple glasses of wine. If you\u2019re in a \u201ccocktail mood\u201d and never wanted any wine, why didn\u2019t you say anything?", "ESH. But I would tell him you and your wife only had two glasses total. \n\nBut when he said 4 glasses. You and your wife should have spoken to and said no wine for us thanks.", "I know it was still a somewhat pricey meal but it is somewhat odd that they didn't realize how expensive the wine was.\n\nBut most people would consider it tacky to order something extremely expensive for the table without discussing that the cost is being split. (Barring a situation where it is known in advance that one person is ordering for the whole group due to more knowledge about the place or cuisine)", "Because he ordered the wine so I assumed he would pay for it. I only got the Venmo request when I got home", "Didn\u2019t even look at the wine list. Ordered a cocktail. He ordered the wine and when the server asked how many glasses, he said 4.", "So why not everyone just paid his food and drinks in the restaurant?\n\nI cant believe you didn\u2019t talk about that topic and he just paid everything and you said nothing.", "its your best friend-couple, yet yall communicate so poorly?"]}
