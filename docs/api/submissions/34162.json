It happens. When ordering $840 worth of wine I would always check thoroughly if the other guests want that wine, want to share. Not just order four glasses when they're drinking a cocktail. \n\nBut If I was you, I would have said when he ordered four glasses \"I'm sorry but we're drinking cocktails, we don't fancy wines this night\". \n\nThere was also the moment when you saw the bill that you potentially could have said \"I'm sorry but that is an awful lot of money and we only had four half glasses of wine - I would really appreciate it if we only had to pay 25% of the wine.\". Would suck but still better for everyone than sucking it up initially but wanting to change it when you get home.\n\nBut then again, if I had ordered $840 of wine and the bill came, and I had seen that the other side had hardly drank any wine, I would propose to pay for the wines. Hell, after the first bottle I would have checked in \"you guys only drank two half glasses, I'd like some more wine, do you want to join in or are you good?\". \n\nAgain, assuming neither side did this out of ill intentions, this is just lack of clear communication. \n\nNow on current stance: I would pay the Venmo and don't go out to dinner with them again. If they ask why, I would answer honestly that there are no ill feelings but that the evening was too expensive for your liking. If they don't understand that, that's their problem. Not yours.", "ESH you had several opportunities not to have any of the wine.  But you can say we only had a quarter of the wine or only send back what you think you\u2019re responsible for.", "ESH, kinda. I can\u2019t imagine selecting such expensive bottles and then expecting anyone else to pay for them without a conversation first. That\u2019s insane unless all of you are extremely wealthy. \n\nOn the other hand, you could have checked the prices before indulging or simply stuck to cocktails. You\u2019re less of TA though.", "NTA I would remind the friend that you didn't order the bottles. If the friend wants payment then tell him you will pay for what you drank. Tell him he can be upset however did he seriously think you guys would cover his drinking habit. Also next time in a setting like that and out to dinner with anyone discuss payment beforehand.", "NTA but I\u2019d probably pay the bill and then stop dining with this couple. Or if you enjoy their company, ask for separate checks at the beginning of the next meal.", "ESH, him for expecting you to pay for wine you didn\u2019t drink. But also you for not speaking up and declining multiple glasses of wine. If you\u2019re in a \u201ccocktail mood\u201d and never wanted any wine, why didn\u2019t you say anything?", "ESH. But I would tell him you and your wife only had two glasses total. \n\nBut when he said 4 glasses. You and your wife should have spoken to and said no wine for us thanks.", "I know it was still a somewhat pricey meal but it is somewhat odd that they didn't realize how expensive the wine was.\n\nBut most people would consider it tacky to order something extremely expensive for the table without discussing that the cost is being split. (Barring a situation where it is known in advance that one person is ordering for the whole group due to more knowledge about the place or cuisine)", "Because he ordered the wine so I assumed he would pay for it. I only got the Venmo request when I got home", "Didn\u2019t even look at the wine list. Ordered a cocktail. He ordered the wine and when the server asked how many glasses, he said 4.", "So why not everyone just paid his food and drinks in the restaurant?\n\nI cant believe you didn\u2019t talk about that topic and he just paid everything and you said nothing.", "its your best friend-couple, yet yall communicate so poorly?", "NTA.  People that do what the other guy did know ***EXACTLY*** what they are doing.  \n\nYou did error tho, you shouldn\u2019t have allowed a drop of wine to be poured into your glasses.  That\u2019s a difficult move, the easiest time to handle it tho is when they bring the glasses, \u201csorry just 2, we aren\u2019t having wine tonite.\u201d   \n\nThat was probably your last dinner with the couple.   If you suck it up and pay his request then you won\u2019t want to see them anytime soon, likewise if you argue the point and pay less than his request they won\u2019t want to repeat again because they can no longer screw you over.", "YTA.  Your communication skills are abysmal.  At any point you could\u2019ve said that you weren\u2019t in the mood for wine.  The server asked how many glasses and you could\u2019ve said \u201cjust two.\u201d  You could\u2019ve also asked at any point if they were expecting you to pay.  This is clearly on your inability to form a simple sentence.", "You should give him a call and discuss it.  Let him know that you had assumed he was covering the wine because he ordered it and asked for 4 glasses, but you are happy to cover some of it (and there is no such thing as a half glass - you and your wife each had a glass from the first 2 bottles even if you didn't finish them).  \n\nBe generous as you expected him to be generous.\n\nESH", "NTA. It makes sense that you assumed he was going to pay since he ordered these expensive bottles so flippantly and seemingly without consulting you. Sounds like a lack of communication on his part.", "Ugh. This is where \"discussing how to split the bill in advance is rude\" really bites you in the ass.\n\nHe is being rude and ridiculous. You should talk to him about it, clearly stating you had no idea how much he was spending on wine - over half the bill - and that if he had wanted to split that cost with you, you would have needed to have been asked in advance and would also have expected to discuss what wine was bought and taken even amounts of it. If he agrees, then that's an end of it. If he doesn't, you need to decide if it's worth ending this friendship over around $400. Either way, make a point of discussing payment in advance if you're ever \\_anywhere\\_ with this man again.\n\nNTA.", "This guy has to be kidding. NTA. It sounds hard to believe you folks are best couple friends. Usually propensities to order hundreds of dollars of wine would have been noted by now. Pay for the second or third most expensive bottle, write it off and either never dine with them again or get the wine situation straight in advance.", "To be honest this is more of a hard lesson learned. It would be NTA to ask for the last bottle to be taken off your portion since you had none but the others? You had some so your defense is weak. \n\nIn the name of keeping your friends, let it go and next time you celebrate, discuss with them that you\u2019re trying to celebrate modestly so to please confer before ordering for the table unless he\u2019s treating. It\u2019s rude for him to order for the table without discussing price then expect to split it evenly.\n\nEven if both couples are wealthy you never know what people are dealing with in private. One could have expensive medical issues. One could have family they are supporting. To just assume it\u2019ll be whatever for others without asking is so rude.", "NTA. I also don\u2019t pay when people go ordering bottles of wine for this exact reason. I don\u2019t really drink, when I do I don\u2019t reallly drink wine, and when I do I only drink like $5 bottles. Someone ordering a bottle of wine for anything over $100 is an absolute no-go from me. I wouldn\u2019t even consider it. $30 is my absolute most I\u2019m willing to spend on wine. I make it clear when people are ordering wine that I don\u2019t want any, and not to include me in the glass count, and then I stand by that when it comes time to pay", "NTA. If you are going to order any expensive wines, you consult the whole table or you pay the whole bill.", "Info: \nWas tip included in that price?  I ask because 20% of 1400 would be $280.  Did they cover the tip?  That additional payment would cover the cost of the 3rd bottle ( that was $190) and of course remember you did purchase cocktails that were not shared.  So it might be closer to a fair split then you realize.  \n\nHowever, It was wrong of them not to check in on splitting costs prior to purchasing very expensive wines.  I would say by etiquette you not responsible for the high cost.  However, you said you are best friends and you yourself purchase expensive wine, just not on this occasion.  Maybe they assumed differently bc of past experiences when you eat and drink together?  Do you always split bills?  If they didn't cover the tip and it's a literal 50/50 split they are requesting it is never wrong to advocate for yourself.  You would not be the asshole if done in a polite manner.  \n\nFeel free to do so tactfully, however please truly have all the information on costs prior to doing so and take things into consideration.  Do you always split.  Did you or your wife buy more expensive food?  How much were these cocktails?  Usually they are at least $16 each at a nice restaurant.  Did you share appetizers - did you eat more of them?  You did drink some wine.  Are you sure it was only 1/2 a glass.  With wine service on expensive bottle the server would pour everyone probably a 5oz pour round the table and, believe me, that does not look like much.  That would leave only one additional glass worth left in the bottle.  Unless you indicated for the server to pour short.  Your friends should have noticed you were not really drinking much wine.  However,  expecting people to pick up on things is a bad idea.  Use your words next time.  And mention something before ordering.  \n\nSimply asking the server for separate checks at the beginning would be fine.    Or when you see your friends looking at the wine list say, my wife and I are going to skip on the wine tonight perhaps we we request separate checks this evening.  They may still choose to share with you and not expect you to pay.  I might chalk it up to a learning experience and just split everything this time or everything but the 3rd bottle.  Use your words next time prior to the arrival of the bill.  And remember when out -clearly ask if people want to share items or not.", "How are yall best friends but communicate so poorly?", "Esh", "ESH - Should have spoken up at the restaurant when he was ordering. \n\nIs ordering a few hundred dollar bottles the norm? If not, he\u2019s def TA than anything. If he\u2019s your best friend, why not just talk to him about it?", "ESH\n\nConsidering they are your best friends is this the first time you have been for a meal with them?  If you have been before then is it normal for you to split the bill or do you usually go Dutch? \n\nYou were at what is clearly an expensive restaurant if the food alone for four people is $5-600.  Its expected that the drinks are going to be similarly pricey.  However there is no excuse for anyone to be ordering wine that costs that much without making sure everyone knows about it and agreed or has offered to cover it separately.  \n\nBut how did you manage to get to the point that three different bottles had been ordered and never once had a look at the wine list yourself?\n\nThis seems like a huge lack of communication on both parts and him for intentionally taking liberties.", "Learned long time ago that the easiest way to avoid these types of situations is to just have each couple pick up their own tab and never have to have anyone feel like they got the short end of the stick. As far as sharing wine once you have any you got to split the cost of the bottle. Most restaurants will split wine \ud83c\udf77 be different bills.", "Nta", "ESH. If I pick the wine I'm paying for it for the table. But you should not have had any if you thought this was a possibility.", " You should have made it clear that you wanted separate checks from the get go.  I make a point when the server comes that we want separate checks. There is nothing wrong with it.\n\nI would have spoke up and said you would split the check minus drinks. \n\nIn the future, be more clear.", "ESH. You should have said you won\u2019t be having wine when he asked for 4 glasses and you shouldn\u2019t have had even half a glass.", "I think unfortunately, since you didn't say anything in the moment about not wanting the wine, and you did have SOME of the wine, you might have to just chalk this up to learning an expensive lesson about dining with these particular friends. \n\nIf you had stuck to your cocktails and told the waiter you didn't want two glasses, that they would be drinking the wine, you'd have grounds to divide the bill differently. \n\nYou COULD say- hey, we actually didn't have any of the third bottle, so I'll take that off our tab, minus the cocktails. \n\nBut good luck with that!", "I think, at the least, OP is off the hook for the third bottle.", "ESH\n\nWhen the server asked how many glasses OP should have corrected them and said two. Then it would have been obvious from that moment on that the wine was being paid for by their friends.\n\nSince they did drink part of the bottle for the first two then I do think they should pay for that. It's a lesson in learning to stand up for yourself.\n\nAlso, how the check is split needs to be decided before anything is ordered. Too many instances of people getting cheated by someone expecting others to pay for their expensive meals.\n\nThe other thing to consider is how good of friends are they? If they are close friends and OP wants to keep the friendship it might be better to pay now and then establish rules going forward. Things like this can and do destroy friendships.", "Depending on how big of drinkers they are, after having 3 bottles of wine (and potentially additional drinks) they may not fully remember or were paying attention to who drank how much of what. This may not be intentional (also very well could be intentional, but giving some benefit of the doubt) and just a foggy memory of what happened. OP knows them better than strangers on the internet.", "I mean, or one could just not want to blow over $800 on a few sips of wine.\n\nIt shouldn't be about ability to pay, but willingness to pay.  I'd be delighted to spend $150 a plate on a meal, but I'd be pretty upset about spending $200 on the wine for that meal, unless it was a hella-special meal, and I knew what was coming.\n\nI love good food, but I definitely try to avoid dining companions who'll order super-expensive alcohol, drink most of it, and then expect me to pay for half of it, even if I had no interest in it.\n\nThe same kinda person will order a super-expensive appetizer (oh, yeah, with caviar and truffles on it \\[can't imagine what that'd taste like, but there it is\\]) and will then expect everybody else at the table to split the cost, whether or not they're interested in it.  Ugh.", "If there's one wine list, and somebody's hogging it, it's easy to never get a look at it.\n\nOr if you've dined with them before, and they're usually more reasonable.  If somebody wants to get a blow-out bottle of wine, it's expected (at least among my friends) to discuss it with the table, rather than just ordering it.", "I think OP should be off the hook completely because the other guy went ahead and paid without discussing anything beforehand.  It\u2019s really rude to come back after the fact to ask for the money.  I\u2019m just saying that even if he\u2019d asked at the moment then she should have yes, helped pay for the first 2 bottles only.", "Disagree, OP is not an asshole. When ordering wine it\u2019s often customary to sample a bottle, and for that everyone should have their own glasses for taking a sip or two. If OP didn\u2019t drink the wine from the bottle by the glass, he should not be on the hook for it.", "Yeah, if OP and and his wife had 1/2 a glass each out of two bottles, that leaves, what, 10 glasses of wine for the other couple? I guess that's not an amazing amount to drink, but I hope they weren't driving home.", "Why did you drink it though? Because you drank it I can see why you'd be expected to contribute to the cost.", "And why did you assumed he pay for everything if he definitely thought you were splitting the bill?", "And then you said to the server, \"no thanks, we only need 2 wine glasses\"...right?! Because that would've made sense if you didn't plan on drinking or paying for the wine.", "That was your chance to say \"No Thanks, I'm not drinking wine this evening.\"", "But he did. He admitted to drinking a half glass of the first two bottles and his wife also had a half glass from the first two bottles. That's more than a taste.\n\nSo in essence they had at least one full glass out of each bottle. Since a bottle of wine has about 4, maybe 5, glasses of wine in it they drank about 25% of the bottle. \n\nIf it were just a taste I would agree with you but he admits he had more than that.", "And if you want to split the bill you talk about it before the waiter comes with the bill.\n\nOP had many chances to say no to the wine or could have just paid his part of the meal.", "Agreed! Using a standard 5oz pour, there\u2019s 5 glasses of wine in a bottle. At 3 bottles that\u2019s 15 drinks. If OP and wife each had a half glass from the first two that leaves 13 drinks for the other two. At ~6 drinks in the span of maybe a 2 hours for an upscale dinner that\u2019s a good amount of alcohol to consume. Highly likely over the legal limit of driving. And if you\u2019re drinking that much probably not paying a ton of attention to what\u2019s going on around you", "Some restaurants don't offer the option of split checks.", "To be fair to OP, if someone grabs the wine menu, and orders without you seeing it, it's pretty hard to know whether they're getting a $100 bottle of wine (suck it up and pay, when the food is $600!) or something much crazier ($375 is a pretty nice bottle of wine, and over $800 total for three bottles is a \\*lot\\* of money).\n\nOrdering wine for the table and not discussing it is kind of a dick move, anyway, no matter how much it costs.  Doubly so when it's more expensive than folks would otherwise drink.\n\nThis is like ordering a dish that's three times as expensive as everybody else's and expecting folks to still split the cost of the meal.

Were you seriously trying to weasel your way into a free glass or two of expensive wine?", "Soft ESH. There was definitely a breakdown in communication here from all parties. Both you and your friend should have discussed who was paying before the first bottle was ordered as you've both clearly jumped to opposite assumptions.\n\nYou drinking from multiple bottle was a mistake and your friend not making sure that the wine was split more evenly if you were being charged half was also a mistake. To be honest, your friend is probably currently unaware how little you drank.\n\nAll of this could have been avoided with a 10 second conversation but now you have 2 options -- either fork up and take it as learning experience or have a longer, potentially more uncomfortable, conversation with your friend.

If you go out with them again, set a budget and who is responsible beforehand.", "Agreed. Or sometimes the split is, one party pays for the food while the other (the party who wants the more expensive wine) covers that.", "Like those friends who say 'should we get appetizers' and you say 'order whatever the hell you want, but I'm not going to get any'... and then the appetizer you didn't want shows up and they continuously pressure you to try some, so you finally give in and eat the food you don't want... and then they expect you to pay half the bill.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI cut those people out of my life 15 years ago, couldn't deal with the hassle anymore.", "2 glass for 3 bottles. 3. That\u2019s 2 glasses of wine out of 15.", "Actually these are great points. The friend clearly didn\u2019t think anything of it, if this would otherwise be normal behavior for them as a group. And as it sounds like they can afford it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d make an issue out of this one time (unless it keeps happening).", "Not necessarily. Someone else pointed out above that tip if the tip wasn\u2019t included in the $1400, then that\u2019s another $280. And that OP and his wife often do drink nice wine. They were eating at a place where just food is still $140/person, and it doesn\u2019t sound like this was outside of their norm. So it actually doesn\u2019t sound like his friend is being rude or ridiculous. Just miscommunication.", "If this place was offering $400 bottles of wine, the cocktails were definitely more than $10 each. Probably more like $20-$30 per cocktail. Still not $700+. But if he\u2019s going to take this route, he should take extra care to be precise.", "This is bad advice. OP is in this predicament because he didn't communicate with his friend. Venmoing a different amount  without communicating with his friend first is just repeating the problem and potentially cause the situation to escalate.\n\nOP needs to do what both he and his friend should have done in the restaurant and just have a conversation. Being passive agressive isn't going to help anyone.", "What? I was saying she would pay for 1.5 bottles (half of 3) for drinking only 2 glasses :)", "The wine ended up on someone's bill when you split the check... isn't that the time to discuss this?", "It sounds like they do often order nice wine together, though.", "The sample consists of one glass for the person who ordered it, and the fact that you think it is a taste test is hilarious.", "NTA anyone that orders a bottle that expensive should have mentioned the price and asked if you want to split it.", "Oh oh! I thought you thought they only had 1.5 bottles of wine and I was like oh no my friend, there was so much more wine in play here \ud83d\ude02", "In most social situations, you would assume that the person doing the ordering and getting the glasses is buying the wine themselves for the table. You don't order an expensive wine (OP didn't even know the price of the bottles), and then say afterwards we are splitting it. When you get something really expensive you need to at least try and get buy in from the people who are supposed to share the expense.\n\nHeck, the OP and partner might not even like the wine since the person ordering didn't even appear to consult about whether the wine was okay with the other people at the table. This is another signal that the wine was not really for the OP, and shouldn't be paid for by the OP."]}
