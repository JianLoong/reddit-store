{"id": 27345, "submission_id": "16ocna0", "title": "AITA For being upset my friend of 20+ years was in my country, but didn't tell me?", "selftext": "I (43F) have known \"Craig\" (41M) for over 20 years. We became roommates, then became best friends. He met \"Becky\" about 12 years ago. She and I tried to be friends, but we just didn't care for the other very much, which was fine. She didn't care if we hung out and so we did regularly, probably once a week. This primarily consisted of drinking and watching horror movies, because we both love them. \n\nThings got a bit more difficult when he moved to another state, but we still managed to do zoom movie nights, which worked for years. We also hung out when we were both back in our home state maybe once a year, sometimes twice. We messaged regularly and were able to maintain a pretty great friendship.\n\nThings got even MORE difficult when I moved to Europe. Now, the time difference was crazy, so trying to do zoom movies was a challenge. I got busy with work and a ton of things and wasn't really messaging as much and so we haven't really talked a lot for the last year or so.\n\nI got married this year and invited him, but I was VERY clear that I wouldn't be upset if Americans couldn't come, because I knew it was a huge expense to come all the way to Europe. In the end, about 15 people from America came, which is lovely and more than I expected.\n\nHe told me that they couldn't afford to come at the moment. Totally fine. A lot of people said that and I get it. I personally hate destination weddings and even though I live here, it's still a destination for them. \n\nAbout 2 weeks before the wedding he told me that he was going to be coming to another country in Europe. The same month that I got married.  I was a bit upset, but then realised I was being a bridezilla about it, so I let it go.\n\nBut then... A month after the wedding he told me that he was actually in my country just a couple hours away from where I live and that he had been here for a couple weeks. They were visiting because Becky had lived in this city for a year around a decade ago. I was honestly really upset and really hurt and I told him that it was ridiculous that he didn't message me to say he was here. I would have happily gone to their city and wouldn't have expected him to come here because it would have been another expense.\n\nThen he tells me that he's basically been keeping our friendship alive for the last 6 months to a year and that he didn't feel that he needed to tell me because if I wasn't going to put in the effort, why should he. \n\nThe thing is, I've been incredibly busy. I did an exhibition for my business which I'm trying to build, I also work quite a bit, and then we were having the wedding with house guests, and we're trying to have a baby through IVF. \n\nI told him that a 20 plus year friendship should be strong enough to go a few months without talking, but he's really upset with me. I'm really upset with him because he came to this country and didn't even tell me. We're supposed to talk about it but I'm just so upset still and I need a little outside perspective. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA: \n1. He was aware that I was extremely busy for that time, as I told him and everyone else. \n\n2. He was also aware that after the wedding, almost everything I was doing would be much lighter (my job changed/50 hour weeks went to 2 weeks on/2 weeks off; the requirements for my business are much less/no more exhibition; the wedding is over; the house is finished; no guests; no plans for the foreseeable future exempt IVF which isn't that time consuming now). For these reasons, I would have had plenty of time to visit him after the wedding/everything else was over.\n\n3. Becky and I don't hate each other, we just aren't friends. We're perfectly capable of hanging out for a day without any drama. \n\n4. They were in the city in my country for WEEKS. I would have offered to come there, so they wouldn't have any expense, or I would have offered to put them up for however long they wanted here, IF they wanted it. I would not have been upset if they wanted to stay in the city they were in.\n\n5. He told me he was in this country AFTER he was already home.\n\n\nETA because the timeline seems unclear:\n\n I invited him to the wedding last year, he said they couldn't afford to come to Europe. Then, about 2 months before the wedding, he told me he was going to a different country in Europe. Then after the wedding, when I messaged to see how his trip was, he told me he had also been in my country for 2-3 weeks.", "created_utc": 1695293277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ocna0/aita_for_being_upset_my_friend_of_20_years_was_in/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He moved away and then you moved away, you both have partners and intricate lives on totally different continents. I get the logic of being hurt, you haven't seen each other in a long time and he's right in your country, you equate physical distance with the reasons why you aren't close. He equates you not putting in the effort to connect as why you aren't close.   \n\n\nI say this next part with zero judgment, but in the last year or so, you haven't had time for him.

He does. And he still managed to try and reach out to you on the regular. You simply didn't have the same priorities and your friendship suffered for it.\n\nI don't think you are an asshole here either, but I'd take a moment and check the righteous indignation at the door. If you had been in contact with him regularly you probably would have known he was traveling to your country. Hell, he probably tried to reach out and tell you and you didn't have time.

I would have been very upset if I'd moved to Europe and she didn't let me know that she was in my country.  \n\nYour friend is using the fact that you've been busy this past year as an excuse because his wife doesn't like you.  You are NTA for being upset.

It's all good, you living your life and all.\n\nHe muxy have been upset because it looks like the busy going to continue, so your relationship needs to be him chasing you. You said it just 6 months, but before you said it was untill the wedding, and logically if you're busy doing IVF ao there is a baby coming, so you're going to be even MORE busy, not less. So for the foseeable future its just supposed to be him chasing you.\n\nAnd if he would have said something he musy have imagined you would be uspset. What does he want - that you won't get married, not have a baby, not have a bussiness etc - so he didn't say anything.

It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s ever had an impact on your friendship and you even admit that you\u2019ve pulled away not him. Perhaps he thinks your now spouse is uncomfortable with your relationship? Maybe he feels like one of you has outgrown the other.\n\nI get being hurt, and a long friendship is worth at least a conversation, but at the end of the day it takes two to have any kind of relationship and if he\u2019s not invested he\u2019s allowed to move on.", "I think it kinda depends on your history over your long friendship. It can very well be that water has been dripping into his resentment cup for years and it finally overflowed. \n\nNo matter how upfront you are, hurt is still hurt. Saying \"I have a triggerfinger right now so don't be surprised if I pull the trigger\" is a warning sure, but how much does that help really? Has he pulled more weight in the past? Are you the one that made it so that plans had to be rearranged or cancelled? Have you been the self centered and exhausting friend? And be honest. Not with me or reddit necessarily, but with yourself, and with him. When it comes to accusations such as the one I just made it is important to not automatically go on the defense and instead be truly honest with yourself and admit previous faults and how your actions truly affected him (excuses be damned, no matter what they are). How has your actions truly made him feel? If you can't find faults in your actions regarding your friendship then that is good too I guess, but if that is the case your friendship has probably ran its course (unless he is willing to admit his faults if he finds he has them).\n\nI have a friend who is lovely to be around, but it became  clear over time that her view on friendships is different than mine and it left me feeling unappreciated if I invested more than the bare minimum. I changed my rules because I realised I can't demand she changes. It sounds as if your friend came to the same realisation. I can't say if one of you is more right than the other, or more or less an asshole. All I can say is that unless you talk to eachother honestly you will both lose a long time friend. So for now NAH, life happens.", "YTA. The problem starts with you: you moved to Europe, and you stopped making any effort to reach out to Craig because you are \"incredibly busy.\" You've put the entire burden of your friendship on him, expecting him to just understand why you're ignoring him, and to not have any feelings about your actions.\n\nOf course Craig isn't going to expect you to make time for him when he is in your country. You've been a horrible friend, and he was trying to avoid being hurt any further by your actions.", "NTA, it sounds like he was making a point to hurt you", "YTA\n\nYou claim to be too busy to send a message first yet in the comments you mentioned you have no problem taking a train or driving over 3 hours away to meet up.

I think you both were hurt, and he got a little passive agressive.  Yes, what he did hurt, but you've been best friends a long time.  Someone has to step up and be the bigger person.   Is his friendship worth it?  Put in some extra effort, let him know he's important.  Then in a few months say, \"That really scared me.  I don't want to lose your friendship.\"  And I bet he will apologize .", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. From what you've said in comments he perceives himself as 'always having to initiate', but from your receipts that perception is clearly not true; it still might be the case that he feels that way, but if so, then it's put you in a situation where if you try to fix it he is likely to view as not being 'enough'. Adult life is just fundamentally busy, no one has enough time to 'catch up' enough with absolutely everyone they care about on a daily basis.\n\nIt is also entirely feasible that his priorities have shifted, potentially due to his wife and you just sort of ignoring each other at best, but he desperately needs you to be 'the bad guy' in the friendship so he can remain (in his head) the 'hero' of the story.\n\nThe other option, though in my mind not very likely, is that he's had a 'thing' for you for decades (explaining why his partner isn't particularly fond of you, albeit with the acknowledgement that it's his bullshit not yours being why she was still cool with you hanging out, and why he tells you 'secrets' he 'wouldn't tell his partner') and you moving away, getting married, and now starting IVF with your husband really cuts away any illusion he might have of you choosing him instead.\n\nMy suggestion would be to put the relationship to bed; grieve the friendship that was lost, but let it go so you can focus on your new life. I hope that you find new friends who you can be just as close with, who don't make such overly dramatic decisions.", "NTA.\n\nCraig was putting OP through a series of weird passive aggressive tests for which he is TA. \n\nRecap of the situation since yall seem to be missing some details:\n\n* He said they couldn't afford to come, OP was like, ok, sorry to miss you, but totally understand. \n* Then two weeks before the wedding he was like, psych, we can afford to come to Europe, but just not to your wedding. Uhhhh, ok, well, have fun then? \n* Then one month after the wedding he says actually, that's all a lie. I've been a few hours away from you for weeks?\n\nCraig is clearly having some big feelings about OP getting married and having a whole ass life that is is not part of. Wondering if OP and Craig ever dated or if Craig expressed interest in her romantically. It sucks he tried to create so much drama in their friendship directly before her wedding and then in the honeymoon period afterward.  \n\n\nPeople do get busy in their lives. Their friends understand. If you have a friendship for 20 years and are willing to let it go because of a difficult 6 months to a year in which your friend moved to a new continent, started a business, got married, and went through a complex medical procedure trying to make a baby at age 43, then you don't really value a) the friendship b) the intricacies of the human life span. \n\nWhile 6 months in a 20 year friendship is a drop in the bucket, it was certainly long enough for Craig to gently ask OP for a conversation about the distance between them and what they might be able to do to mitigate it. I think OP would have obliged and Craig wouldn't have had to be a passive aggressive poo-head to make his point. \n\nGood riddance, Craig.", "YTA - So he reaches out to you to tell you he's a couple hours from you, and you get mad??? Are you for real?", "NTA", "NTA. He is not your friend. Time to let this one go.", "NTA. I'd be devastated. Also he's a big boy and could have at any point communicated this to you like an adult.

You\u2019re the one who got a shitty on because he had to go to another European country. You don\u2019t get on with his partner. Why exactly would he continue to make an effort when it\u2019s not being reciprocated?", "OK - but if you want to maintain the friendship, I don't see how getting mad helps. \n\nAnd if you don't want to continue the friendship, I don't see how getting mad helps either.", "Eh good friendships last without talking. My friend moved to Europe for 2 years and we barely talked. Still good friends now she's back. My husband's friends all live across the country and we basically only see/talk to them every couple years and they are still good friends and came to our wedding.", ">But suddenly you want him to read your mind, and guess\n\nYou don't have to be a mindreader to say \"hey, I'll be in X City for 3 weeks in June, if you want to catch up\".\n\n>he probably genuinely assumed, you wouldn't be able\n\nSo, he guessed she wouldn't have time but actually asking her required psychic powers? How strange...", "Maybe?", "This is pretty much how I felt about it.", "Because he didn't tell me. And it wasn't \"long\"after he was gone, it was like 4 days.", "Okay kind of unnecessarily harsh for a situation that I don't think really warrants it? But thanks for taking the time to add your judgement. It's not really causing a lot of drama. It's just a situation that I was looking for outside perspective on.", "Aw, thank you for this lovely comment.", "I completely understand,  and I did apologise to him for that. Maybe I'm upset still because he didn't apologize to me? I've acknowledged that I hurt him and genuinely apologized, but he doesn't think I have a right to be upset that he was in the country, and basically used that as a punishment for hurting him, even though he had never expressed that.", "These are all done, and were the entire time he was here. He actually told me that he purposely didn't see me because he was upset with me. From our conversation, he implied he was doing it to punish me.", "I realise this is Reddit and I asked for opinions, but you don't actually know our friendship. It's been fantastic for over 20 years and the only reason that it's suffered this year is because adult life got in the way, which happens. Everyone else seems to be aware of this. I don't get upset when my friends who have babies don't message me as much because they're busy. If someone takes a new job and doesn't message me for a month, I don't get all up in arms because I'm a grown up.\n\nTo me it seems like he is being the entitled and immature one. He expects the friendship to remain exactly the same when it can't. I'm not the one who feels entitled to exactly as much time from him as we've had.", "I do want to keep the friendship, but also... it feels really shitty. I know it wasn't great being absent, and having him do all the work for 6 months, but he came to my country and didn't tell me, to spite me. \n\nIt's hard to put in perspective why I would want to save this friendship, or if it's worth having someone who would do that in my life.", "Exactly, i have this friend who was visiting this city 2.5 hours from me, I haven\u2019t seen her in like 10 years and we don\u2019t talk that often but i drove and had lunch with her and her family and drove back home.", "You also didn\u2019t reach out in that time?", "YTA, I think. Ok, OP, I'm going to try to put this to you from another angle. He clearly feels you haven't made enough of an effort recently.  I know you've had a lot on, and that happens. At that point, perhaps there are no assholes.\n\nBut can you not see the reasoning, that if you (apparently) don't even have time to TEXT HIM - then how would you suddenly 'find' time to TRAVEL A FEW HOURS EACH WAY, and see him?! That's at least a day out of your schedule, when you claim to have no time to even message him. You're sending mixed messages, and punishing him for his interpretation of those messages.\n\nSo I think you need to calm down, and see his side. It's probably a misunderstanding. He probably DID assume, that you wouldn't have the time/interest to see him. And so it DOES sound a little hypocritical to get annoyed, that he didn't somehow read your mind - and that you'd suddenly find significant time for him, after not having even small amounts of time to text him (for a year).\n\nFriends grow apart, don't keep in touch, etc. That happens. But you can't be so annoyed in these circumstances. You would have done better to try to understand his thinking, rather than kicking up a fuss. \n\nAnd how close you are to Becky (or how they are visiting a city she once lived in), has zero relevance to the story. I've no idea why it's included (particularly the comment about your lack of closeness to her). It feels like you're trying to imply Becky was keeping him from you, or that visiting her previous city isn't as important as him seeing you. But I suggest you look at how your own communication may have confused him - not Becky.\n\nDo you see my point?", "Buddy above was overly obnoxious about it, but he does have a point.\n\nHe was traveling for his reasons, and due to, from his viewpoint, your deteriorating relationship, he judged that it wasn't worth his limited time to dedicate to you. And though it may hurt, it is valid.\n\nThere is only a finite amount of time one has when they are on holiday, and decisions have to be made on what to spend that time on, and lots of things have to get cut. Unfortunately for you, you were on the cut list.\n\nLots of us with family overseas have to make that same decision if we vacation over there. Just as an example, I and my family was recently in Italy where we have a lot of family, but we didn't want to spend time visiting them, we wanted to see certain places we wanted, so we didn't tell them we were visiting.\n\n It's just a part of life. Friendships evolve over time. Sometimes people are with you on the journey all the way through, others are only on the journey for part of the way. Treasure the time you spent, and worry not that it may be that each one's journey takes them to a different destination.", "Maybe because you've been giving him the impression that \"you're so busy\" he assumed that you would be too busy to meet up with him. \n\nHow can you claim you're too busy to send him a message first every now and then yet not busy enough to take a 3 hour car ride to meet up with him? \n\nI might not be a genius but I'm sure sending a message is a lot quicker than traveling to another city to say hi.", "He is in his fortys but couldnt talk with you about his feelings and trys to \"punish\" you, is this Realy a friendship you want to continue?", "From a conversation that he initiated correct?\n\nSince all of those events are done have you actually reached out to him first moving forward now? Or is he still the one initiating all contact?", "And yet you\u2019re the one who\u2019s whining that he didn\u2019t make time and space for you whilst on his vacation with his partner\u2026", "That's fair. Different people manage emotions differently and different people manage friendship differently. Being upset as various stuff is normal. Feeling the need to express those feelings to someone else might not be. Hashing out feelings with in-depth discussions of a \"state of the relationship\" nature may be part of a healthy spousal or BF/GF relationship, or maybe among teens. But as a middle-aged adult, if a friend tried to engage me in a \"state of the friendship\" conversation reviewing mis-steps, hurt feelings, perceived slights and the like, I'd withdraw. I wouldn't have the energy for drama. But maybe you and your friend have a different dynamic where you like to have these sorts of discussions.", "In the weeks that he was here? No, because I had five house guests from the wedding.", "I only included Becky because I thought it was relevant to why he was in the country. It felt weird leaving that out. I said earlier she's never stopped us from hanging out and it's definitely important for her to be in the city she once lived in. That's not what I meant at all.\n\nI get what you're saying, and I can definitely see it from that side. He ALSO expected me to read his mind that he was upset about me not messaging him as much. \n\nI had told him earlier in the year that it was going to be a really busy few months, but after the wedding things would calm down significantly. So while I get what you're saying, he did know that I had much more time now. I had told him that if he wanted to come to the wedding, he could stay with us and then we would have time to do so stuff around here.", "No, sorry, I messaged him, so that conversation I initiated.", "I messaged to ask how his trip was and to see if he wanted to do a zoom soon.", "Also, isn't it immature for him to punish me for being busy? \n\nIf anyone is \"whining\", which is a ridiculous way to put it, isn't it him? that I'm not making enough time for him in a year where I had a multi-day business exhibition, a wedding, out of town guests for two weeks, and IVF?\n\nETA especially because he NEVER TOLD ME he was upset. He never communicated that to me in any way.", "I'm not whining. There is a difference between being immature and whining and feeling genuine hurt as an adult. It's called emotions. \n\nHe was here for weeks, not a day. We've gone out of our way to see each other in our home state. Every year. He's come back to the city we lived in to see me on his way to the home state.\n\nIt is not crazy to expect him to tell me that he was going to be in my country for weeks.", "Okay, so you didn\u2019t reach out, he tells you he feels he\u2019s been carrying the friendship, AND you acknowledge that you were too busy for him, but think you have the right to be upset?", ">He ALSO expected me to read his mind that he was upset about me not messaging him as much. \n\nHoney, reciprocal communication is just basic social expectations. If someone takes the effort to talk to you, it is expected that you would take the effort to do the same. Friendship is a two way street as the saying goes.\n\nHe just treated you the way you were treating him. You didn't take the time to message him, so he didn't take the time to message you that he was in the country. \n\nDo unto others as you would have them do unto you, is the saying that applies here.", "How long after the wedding did you message him?\n\nIf he was in your country for almost a month after your wedding you clearly didn't reach out to him at any point during that time even though you say at your schedule is a lot lighter?\n\nI'm sure if he would have received the message from you while he was there he would have relented and wanted to meet up but the fact that you didn't made him even more upset. Not necessarily saying his actions were right but I've been in that position before and it sucks feeling like you're only a friend when it's convenient for them otherwise you're put in the back burner.", "So over the course of 52 weeks you\u2019ve taken up three weeks for a visiting friend, we\u2019ll say 4 weeks for your business event (to cover prep time etc), 2 for a wedding and say 20 in total On and off for your IVF treatments. That leaves around half a year where he\u2019s tried and got little to no response.\n\nWhy would he tell you? He\u2019s tried contacting and communicating and got very little. You\u2019re now only concerned because you\u2019re butt hurt he didn\u2019t take time out of his vacation with his partner  for someone who wasn\u2019t responding to him or even giving him a heads up that you wouldn\u2019t be available.", "There\u2019s a difference between calling in on your way somewhere and going on holiday with your partner and then telling her you\u2019re going to split for a day or two to go see a friend who she doesn\u2019t like and doesn\u2019t like her.\n\nYou aren\u2019t acting like an adult, you are acting like a spoilt child.", "I feel like you're willfully misunderstanding me.\n\n I messaged 3 days after my wedding, while I still had guests, but just to say hi. He didn't tell me he was going to be here. After his trip, which was about 3-4 weeks after the wedding, we were chatting, and he told me he had been here for 2-3 weeks, and when I expressed hurt that he didn't tell me, he then said he was upset at me, and then implied he didn't tell me to \"get back\" at me.", "Okay, I agree and see your point. \n\nBut if for over 20 years, I did that, consistently, and then explained to him that the next 6 months were going to be insane for me, and I would be much more free after things calmed down, didn't I already communicate to him?", "I had actually messaged him quickly 3 days after my wedding, then about 3 weeks later. I had American guests stay with me for several weeks.", "You've underestimated the amount of times there, but I get that, because you couldn't know exactly what was what. \n\nI do get what you're saying. It wasn't a full year, and I did respond. I agree I didn't give him back what he was putting in. That's been the case for friends here and there, when they've gotten busy or had kids, etc. \n\nI didn't refuse to tell them how I felt, passive aggressively go to their country, stay for weeks, and then tell them about it. I understood that sometimes shit happens.", "I would have come there, to the city they were in, and I would have gladly hung out with Becky. They've been together for 11 years, so it's not like it would be the first time we would've hung out. We don't hate each other, we just aren't friends. It's not dramatic, I'm friends with a lot of my friends' partners, but she and I just didn't work as friends.", "SO, you let the friendship go essentially, then get mad that it\u2019s no longer there\u2026", "I already admitted that I wasn't as communicative as I had been for the previous 20 plus years. I've also expressed how busy I was and had told him I would be that busy. I told all of my friends that and no one else had a problem with me being more absent than usual. \n\nYou can think I'm TA, that's fine. I genuinely wanted outside perspective. This isn't it."]}
