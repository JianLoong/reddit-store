{"id": 28033, "submission_id": "16xenie", "title": "AITA for letting people know of my pregnancy at my friend's birthday party?", "selftext": "I (28F) work as an apprentice at a local brewery and am an aspiring brewmaster. I've somewhat earned the reputation of being \"the beer girl\" in my social circles, (which I have mixed feelings about, but I digress). \n\nRecently, my partner Rob (28M) and I discovered that we are pregnant. We're not flashy people and don't necessarily want our announcement of our pregnancy to be a BIG event, but as of right now, only Rob's mom knows because we agreed we're not quite ready to open up the floodgates yet.\n\nRob and I are good friends with another couple, Dana (26F) and Todd (27M). This past Saturday, Dana had a birthday party. It was something of a big, intensely orchestrated occasion, with many guests, planned games, and food.\n\nAround midway through the night, I was chatting with Todd and Dana, and Todd brought out a large crowler which, according to him, contained the \"best festbier [he] had ever had.\" He urged me to try it. \n\nI told him no, that's okay, I don't feel like drinking tonight. Todd knew this was out of character for me though, especially this season, and continued insisting I try some.\n\nTodd was being kind of loud, and other people started turning their attention towards our interaction. At this point I was getting flustered and started losing control of my social skills (I have severe social anxiety and bad at thinking on the spot), and somehow, I ended up just blurting out that I was pregnant.\n\nSilence. One good friend finally broke the silence with an \"Oh my gosh, congratulations!\" The collective conversation at that point became about my pregnancy, people asking about due date, etc. I could see from all the way across the room Rob eyeing me, looking rather disappointed. \n\nMeanwhile, Dana's mood inmediately *dropped.* For the rest of the party, she displayed a sour, withdrawn demeanor, despite Todd trying to continue the games that they had planned. Finally, at the end of the night, while we were eating cake, Dana suddenly got up and left abruptly to go out on her deck,. Todd followed her. You could hear the muffled sound of her ranting/crying about something, all squeal-y and distressed, Todd attempting and failing to comfort her.\n\nOn the way home, Rob and I had a big fight. He said he couldn't believe I thought it was okay to announce our pregnancy like that, especially without him. I tried to explain that there was a big part of the conversation that he didn't see, but in response, he says I could have made a million other excuses instead of resorting to the pregnancy. He accused me of being attention-seeking and just looking for the first opportunity I could find to turn the \"spotlight\" on myself. From there, things between us exploded. \n\nSo basically, Rob and Dana are absolutely furious with me. Todd meanwhile, over texts to Rob, has been much more understanding, but Rob says it's just because Todd is kind of an easygoing dude and can't empathize with why something like this would matter to Dana.

All you had to say was you were on a new medication and couldn't drink right when you started.  Or you were trying a new diet and were alcohol free for a bit.

This party was at a place that you're well known, and you knew coming into this that the question was going to be asked about why you weren't drinking. At that point, you should've told the hosts or at least prepare a better excuse for not drinking. \n\nYour friends are TA cause if reddit had a nice for every time some self centered Sally got pouty over someone \"stealing their thunder\", all awards would be free of charge...", "YTA, sorry. You could simply have said you had a headache. Or just barely tasted the festbier - that isn't going to harm a fetus - so you could give an opinion about it to Todd. \n\nWhile your motivation need not have been to get attention, that is absolutely what you achieved. Rob was wrong to say you did it on purpose however. \n\nYou don't seem too respectful of your birthday friend Dana, saying she was ranting and \"squeal-y and distressed\" because you drew so much attention.", "Are you sure you got the ages right? Everyone in this story is acting like a 12 year old", "YTA - don\u2019t steal the limelight at someone else\u2019s party - PERIOD!", "NTA\n\nSo, not drinking around a people with whom you usually drink, especially if you are a woman around 30yo, is basically a pregnancy announcement. I\u2019m not remotely surprised it ended up as it did. \n\nTodd should also have been aware of this and stopped offering as soon as you declined. \n\nYou didn\u2019t do it on purpose. It\u2019s just a thing that happened. Your friend and bf are being unnecessarily punitive over it. It shouldn\u2019t matter much to Dana, it\u2019s not even a milestone birthday. A little annoyance is ok but this is excessive.", "YTA.  You could have simply excused yourself the conversation with Todd.  Blurting out your pregnancy announcement like that was incredibly disrespectful to both Rob and Dana.", "NTA, I hate when people pressure people to drink. You were pressured and blurted out your reason for refusing.\n\nRob is being an AH, he should be much more sympathetic to the situation you were in. He\u2019s also being a baby about getting to share the spotlight.  He still gets to be there when you tell your families, other friends, etc.\n\nAnd Dana is a huge AH. Massive birthday parties in general are assholish for anyone over ten and under 100 unless it\u2019s a bar/bat mitzvah or a quince\u00f1eria. For her to throw a tantrum because she wasn\u2019t the absolute center of the attention the entire night is childish.\n\nYou did not do anything wrong. But if you want to be nice to Rob, plan a dinner party for him to tell his family about the baby.\n\nignore Dana.", "NTA. It was a grown up birthday party.  You were asked a question and side stepped it but Todd kept on. It was a birthday party for a 28 year old not a sweet 16 or a wedding.  You told him why and just because people talked about it doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthe 28 year old birthday girl\u201d wasn\u2019t the big deal. Good grief you all are grown ups moving forward with life.  I am floored a grown up cried because for 5 minutes the conversation wasn\u2019t about her. I can understand your husband being disappointed but you can still make a big deal with announcing to your families.", "YTA, no is a full sentence and you didn\u2019t need to make someone else\u2019s event about you. As he said, there are so many other excuses you could have given or simply said no, I don\u2019t want it.", "NTA - I don\u2019t get all the comments about not announcing your pregnancy at someone\u2019s birthday. It wasn\u2019t an *announcement*. You answered one person\u2019s question honestly under pressure. People need to lighten up here. You weren\u2019t intentionally putting the spotlight on yourself. \n\nAlso, since when are we not allowed to share news at events? I went to a friend\u2019s wedding pregnant and bumped into people I hadn\u2019t seen in awhile. I freely talked about the changes in my life, and there was no problem. Mature adults don\u2019t create drama over these things.", "YTAH", "NTA - Todd should\u2019ve taken \u201cno\u201d as an answer, this is as much his fault as it is yours. You shouldn\u2019t have to lie to get someone to leave you alone when it comes to drinking alcohol. \n\nAlso, Dana can grow TF up. I get being upset that the \u201climelight\u201d was taken from her, but she could\u2019ve easily just congratulated you and then moved on instead of throwing a tantrum. She made it a bigger deal than it was. \n\nYour partner is also TA, turned on you pretty quick.", "Soft YTA. You could\u2019ve should\u2019ve just said your stomach was off. You knew your reputation as \u201cbeer girl\u201d so what did you expect? People wouldn\u2019t notice you not drinking? You should\u2019ve been prepared. You ruined Dana\u2019s big extravagant party and I don\u2019t know how you can fix that. You also took this moment away from your partner.", "Why do people say \"we are pregnant \" when obviously only one of them is. Just curious cos I've seen this written a few times.", "ESH", "ESH. The whole pressuring people to drink thing when they don\u2019t want to is so ridiculous. Just accept no as  an answer. I can totally see how you got flustered and blurted it out, but your friend\u2019s birthday party isn\u2019t it. however, it\u2019s not the end of the world. Talk with your friend, apologize. You don\u2019t want this to ruin her birthday or sour your pregnancy, which is very exciting.", "NTA. You tried not to talk about your pregnancy, and that is a valid decision with or without the birthday party context. Todd was TA here after he continued to push you when you said no.  You got pushed into a corner here. Even if you were comfortable being quick on your feet with a lie, what if he didn\u2019t accept that? This story is an illustration of why everyone should mind their business and respect others\u2019 boundaries.", "NTA , I think everyone has been in a situation where they blurted out something without meaning to , if Dana had just carried on and let it go no drama would\u2019ve happened but instead she chose to ruin her own party by insisting  on being miserable for the rest of the party. Also they\u2019re almost 30 and they react like this over a birthday party ? Seems very immature imo", "NTA - it\u2019s a birthday. Unless it was her sweet 16 she can fuck off", "NTA Todd shouldn't have kept pushing you to drink. Dana is being completely unreasonable and she sounds like a narcissist. Rob should know you well enough to get past his disappointment and recognize that you get flustered and uncomfortable when put on the spot. Being unable to lie convincingly at the drop of a hat is not a bad quality.\n\nTodd seems to be the only person taking responsibility for his part. Rob owes you an apology and you should drop Dana. She is not a good friend.", "Yeah YTA. You ruined Dana\u2019s birthday party and if I was her I\u2019d rethink the whole friendship. There\u2019s always a time and place", "Soft YTA. You never make an announcement like this during someone else\u2019s event. You owe Dana an apology. If she announces her engagement at your wedding you will know why.", "Rob and Dana are being a tad dramatic and downright rude to you.  \nTodd should have left you alone at the first No Thank You.  \n\nThey are all in the wrong.  \n\nYou are NTA", "NTA. \n\nIf Todd is such an easygoing dude, why did he pressure you to drink when you said no?\n\nI\u2019ve been pregnant early on around a large group of people that drink and it is untypical of me to say no to something, so I\u2019ve felt that anxiety too. It\u2019s unfortunate that it happened at Dana\u2019s party, but I understand the struggle.", "Odd man out here \n\nNTA \n\nTodd made you uncomfortable by pressuring you to drink. That was a jerk move on his part. I think you could\u2019ve made a different excuse, but I\u2019ve been here, and it\u2019s frustrating when people don\u2019t take no for an answer. I understand why Rob is upset and personally I\u2019d reach out to Dana and apologize for her feelings, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH here", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Todd is TA for not only the pressure he placed on you but drawing more attention to it too. I feel bad for Dana because she did a lot of planning for her event, but it\u2019s not like you clanked your glass and/or grabbed a microphone to announce it. It wasn\u2019t really an announcement in the first place. And I think your partner is kinda TA too. He should have had your back and been there for you. The fact that he claims you did it to seek attention even after you told him your experience makes it sound like he doesn\u2019t know you very well.

Second I said that actually, my head kind of hurts, and alcohol might make it worse, but Todd told me that it wasn't too strong, and so I should at least try a sip. Third and finally, I said more firmly, I said no, so please stop asking. Todd still insisted. Note that Todd can be a bit pushy bad at reading people (he has accpted when we bring up to him that sometimes he is not good at reading people's emotions and ends up pushing their boundaries), so this was in character for him.\n\nAt this point I could feel my ears getting all hot as the anxiety began rising as everyone started looking at us, and I just wanted it to be over.
