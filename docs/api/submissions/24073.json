She let me stay there as a child every other weekend with my dad as my parents were separated, but that\u2019s where it stopped. She\u2019s very elderly now (93) and my dad always insists that I take her out, so whenever I do I always end up paying for her food and drinks and never get a thank you from her or my dad..\n\nMy dad was unemployed for a long time this year and got himself into huge debts, he asked me to give him \u00a320 to help get him insurance for something, to which I did. He told me he would pay me back - he has not. \n\nSo in the midst of all this I asked if him and my Nan wanted to go for a lunch out together, obviously they did. I showed up with a box of chocolates and a card for both of them, to which my dad made a comment about how it\u2019s late (2 days as I hadn\u2019t seen him) and said \u2018oh only chocolates\u2019 and just chucked it down like it was nothing and I hadn\u2019t gone to any effort..this hurt me but I pushed it down and continued with the meal. All of this while he still owes me money for helping him out..\n\nSo it comes to paying for the bill and he says \u201cmaybe you will treat us as you invited us out\u201d i refused and said I couldn\u2019t afford to pay for 3 meals, to which he said we\u2019ll spilt my nans bill and pay that. I wouldn\u2019t mind either but they ordered multiple starters and drinks and desserts and still expected me to pay. It honestly hurts me because I  feel mistreated here and like I\u2019m being taken advantage of. \nI ended up spending \u00a348 on a lunch at a really bog standard restaurant. And not a thank you in sight, when we left the restaurant he also made a comment about how I should take my nan out \u201cevery Sunday\u201d. \n\nI left feeling so deflated and crap. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m wrong for my beliefs as I know she\u2019s older but she was so stingy to me in my childhood, never treated me to anything and now I am expected to spend my money on her all the time.

How old are you? Considering you had not seen your dad for 2 days, I assume you don't live in the same house?", "NTA\n\nOnly thing, when you invite someone to birthday dinner, it is implied that you pay unless discussed upfront.  \n\n\nHaving said that, it sounds to me like your nan was a cold fish to you while you were child.  I'd rather not eat for a day than make my grandson pay for his sandwich from his pocket money.  You know, the type of relationship you have with someone is based on how the relationship was in the past.  Just because she's 93 now doesn't mean she deserves to be treated like grandma of the year suddenly.\n\nAs far as that comment your dad made about you 'should take your nan out every Sunday' - let HIM  take nan out every Sunday.  It's his mother after all.\n\nIt also take sooooooooooooooooooooooo little to say 'thank you.'  They both sound very crude tbh.", "If you can\u2019t let go of \u00a320, perhaps don\u2019t invite the person who owes you \u00a320 to lunch. \n\nAnd perhaps make it clear you\u2019re not actually inviting them out to lunch but rather asking if they want to pay for their own food while eating at the same restaurant as you if you don\u2019t want to treat.", "NTA. You need to stay out of these situations.\n\n>when we left the restaurant he also made a comment about how I should take my nan out \u201cevery Sunday\u201d. \n\nHe can do it.", "ESH\n\nThey are obviously taking advantage of you and not appreciating what effort you do make, but when you invite someone out for lunch for their birthday, it's implied that you will be paying. If you don't want to be expected to pay, say so in advance. Don't just store up resentment. It's very easy to say you don't have that kind of relationship with your Nan and have no spare cash so all future outings will be pay for yourself.\n\nYou don't know what your Nan's financial situation was like when you were young, and quite frankly, she wasn't the parent. She didn't owe you pocket money or treats. She is also incredibly elderly in a cost of living crisis. I'm pretty sure you live in the UK, where the elderly are frequently mistreated by the state; their pensions are constantly being cut whilst they're expected to fund any care they may need. I get that you don't have a lot of cash to spare, but that doesn't mean she has lots to spare either. Take a moment to consider what kind of relationship you actually want with your relatives, and then act accordingly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How are there so many parents acting like children. Set some boundaries. But that said - your nan is 93. How many more lunches will there be. It's up to you to keep that in mind and spend the time and money you want to spend.", "You are not obliged to pay for anything or take anyone out so there\u2019s that - and your father sounds a right piece of work but i have to say your attitude to your nan is deeply resentful and ungrateful considering how much of a burden you potentially were to her. \n\nI note that if  nan is 93 and you are 24 then she was 69 when you were born and 79 when you were 10. So despite being a pensioner - on presumably very little money herself - she still opened her home to you for the whole weekend every other weekend while you were a child. Cared for you, fed you and was a reliable stable person in your life, when she herself was quite frankly poor, old and exhausted. So she didn\u2019t have what it took to treat you a lot or give you pocket money- so what - that's the parent\u2019s job.", "I\u2019m 24, i work two jobs for my money and I\u2019m trying to budget and save for my future.

Honestly, sounds like she treated OP like crap.", "Why do you listen to your dad when he insists you take your nan out?

Believe in yourself. You need to stop feeling guilty and pressured. You are 24 and working two jobs. Make sure to take some time for yourself. And if you are working two jobs, it means money is tight. No one works two jobs for the fun of it.\n\nBtw, write off the \u00a320. It isn't worth harbouring anger over it.

She is not supposed to give you an allowance, that\u2019s something parents do. And yeah, you\u2019re right, she should be tankful and your dad should pay you back.
