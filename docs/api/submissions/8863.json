But he isn't used to living off of such a small income and he is not managing to save money.  \n\nHe thought he could put away $1,000 a month and buy his motorcycle back next summer.

You and your husband should not give or loan money to BIL ever again.  Frankly, I don't think you should buy anything else from him because he resents it so much.\n\nLet him figure it out.

He needs to take some accountability", "NTA. You've given him incentive to pay you back. As someone else said, it's collateral. Like a pawn.\n\nThat complaining that you had the money and could have just lent it to him? It's because he either is having trouble paying you back or doesn't want to pay you back on your schedule. You said it yourself. *If you didn't have the bike he wouldn't be paying you at all*. He wants you to give the bike back so he doesn't feel like he *has* to pay you back.\n\nIf it gets to the end of the two years and he's made a real and actual effort to pay you back, not just appearing to save, but actually giving you a chunk of money, I'd amend the agreement and give him longer to pay.

Geez, why doesn\u2019t He try to get a loan from a bank using the motorcycle as collateral?  Then he can buy his bike back.  But, he can\u2019t do that because his credit sucks (just a guess).

Not the point, I know.\n\nRegarding the purchase, NTA", "NTA - you are not responsible for his situation and offered him a way out.  He didn't have to take it and it sounds like there were a lot of other toys he could have sold to get money.  Just because you have it, doesn't mean he is entitled to it.", "NTA. His complaining says a lot about him. You help him and all he can do now is cry about the deal. It's very simple if he just pays back what he borrowed.", "NTA - If he is having trouble saving to buy the bike back, he would never have paid back the loan. Perhaps he can sell one of his several snow mobiles to get the money to get the bike back.", "NTA\n\nYou can be 100% sure, that he would've never paid you back the loan. No he's unable to pay back for the motorbike, and he WANTS it back. So how eould paying back a loan he doesn't want to pay back place in his priorities? Good on you for helping him out but not being a fool about it.", "Nta, if he needed money, he could sell his toys to strangers to never see it again, instead you offered the deal that he can buy motorcycle back\n\nYou're not a bank to lend money, and even bank have the interest rate, to gain something of the loan \n\nHe just wanted you to gift him money just because of \"family\"", "NTA \n\nAs someone else said the motorcycle is collateral. That\u2019s how bank loans work - you put something up that you\u2019ll lose if you don\u2019t pay the loan back in the agreed upon time.", "Nta but yea this as long as you paid him fair market value for the bike and honor the deal of him being able to buy it back  the bike is just collateral on the interest free loan", "I don\u2019t think OP twisted his arm, but I do think he was pressed enough to enter the contract under duress which is why I do feel OP took advantage of the situation.", "Something tells me he just wanted the money without loosing anything and not care when to repay.", "My mom used to lend money to her family.  And then fight with my dad when they did not pay it back.", "We paid market value.  But it would not matter if we paid 1/4 of that.

Because he would only have to pay that amount back.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering because OP was clear in saying the bil had several kinds of toys, yet OP targeted the motorcycle knowing the bil doesn\u2019t have the financial skills to save or budget.  Some aren\u2019t taught this and some learn it at different times through trial and error so it wasn\u2019t just his work ethic but OP knew this wasn\u2019t a deal bil would be able to fulfill without help beyond help securing a more consistent job.", "lol where are they giving two year 0% interest loans out under duress? Please twist my arm!", "Guess he could have gone to a bank for the loan then. But they\u2019d have expected collateral too.", "He got much better terms from OP than he would have from just about any other lender or buyer.", "If he can't afford to buy the bike back then he would have been able to pay the loan back. Looks like he is upset he did not get that money from you for nothing.", "How much was the cost in comparison to the amount he wanted for the loan? \n\nIt does matter if you paid market value because you put a condition on it that he has to buy it back in two years. So if you paid him less than it\u2019s worth knowing he wouldn\u2019t be able to pay that money in the time period than your taking advantage of his situation rather than being a fair deal. Also the bike is being used and value will decline in the two years so the price he buys it back for should be less to reflect the current market when/ if he gets the money together. You don\u2019t want it to be a loan so don\u2019t treat it like one.", "If we were going to be charged depreciation then I would have paid less up front for the bike.  Like I said.  He could have sold it to.us for $10,000 and then only paid that much to get it back.", "As well as expecting the same amount of money for a bike that\u2019s value would decline in that time period. I would say NTA if they paid what the bike was worth and they sold it back to him at a fair price. However I feel like they have taken advantage of the situation. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to not want one of the other things he has brought if they have no interest in the item because they are still buying it. But it should be a fair deal.", "If it were a loan we would be charging interest.", "Let's say it's a $24,000 bike.  If I bought it from him for $8,000 should I charge him market value to get it back?", "How is that reasonable and not taking advantage of the situation? You should pay market value but he should also be expected to pay market value when he buys it back. Otherwise it\u2019s a loan with collateral.", "I wanted to understand the whole situation - he wanted a $8000 loan and you would only give him a $24000 deal for the bike when you know he is terrible with money that contributing to him into more debt rather than helping. Yea he is an adult. Really he should be seeking financial advice."]}
