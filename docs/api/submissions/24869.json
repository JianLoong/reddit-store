I am currently crying while writing this and English isn\u2019t my first language so sorry for mistakes. So today I woke up at 12pm which is unusual for me since my stepfather cares so much. I usually have to wake up before 9am or he will get mad. Well today I didn\u2019t because my phone died in the night so my alarm didn\u2019t go off. I woke up and got really scared because of the time but I did my normal morning routine and around 1pm went downstairs for breakfast. My stepfather was there but didn\u2019t say anything to me because my mom was there. I then went back to my room and watched tiktok not thinking anything. Around 3pm I got hungry again and went down for lunch. My stepfather cooked lunch today for the first time in 2 months. When I was eating lunch my mom left so there was just my stepfather and me. He immediately started raising my voice at me and told me how much I disappointed him today and that I didn\u2019t do anything today. I started holding back tears but didn\u2019t cry. He also told me that he will not respect this kind of behavior and then he left. That\u2019s when I finally broke down. My mom walked in and asked me what happened. I couldn\u2019t say anything because I was shaking so much so I just left to my room. I know you\u2019ll think I am overreacting but I can\u2019t help it. So my mom followed me into my room and that\u2019s when I told her everything. I told her how bad it is for me to be around him and everything. Keep in mind that his real kids that are at their mom\u2019s house are sleeping even longer than I was today but he doesn\u2019t care because they\u2019re his real kids. Then I just heard my stepfather shouting at my mom about how neither of us do anything that he has to cook and everything. About how I never help him even tho I ask him every single day at least 3 times if he wants to help with something and he always says no. So my mom and stepfather ended up fighting and I heard everything. It just hurts me so much seeing that I\u2019m the problem and they\u2019re fighting because of me. My mom stood up for me and I love her so much it\u2019s just my stepfather who always has a problem. So yeah thank you for reading this please tell me if you have any advice. AITA?\n\nEdit: For context my stepfather is with my mom for 4 years and both my biological parents asked him not to parent me. Both my parents don\u2019t care when I wake up it\u2019s just him who always has a problem. People were saying my mom should break up with him but they have a 2 year old kid together and it would be complicated.

While I don't have advice I can tell you this is not your fault in any way.  Please stay strong in the knowledge that you are not the problem.", "NTA. Long, but positive post here\n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to point out OP did not mention any details on how long stepfather has been married to OP\u2019s mother, or the dynamic they have agreed on as a family. Nor did OP describe at all the typical boundaries or behaviors stepfather has asked to expect from OP. Finally, I noticed there are no details aside from the subtle mention of stepfather\u2019s biological kid\u2019s essentially loafing about at their mother\u2019s house. \n\nSo we know nearly nothing about his relationship or how he has or even is still raising his biological kids, nor do we know the family dynamic of OP\u2019s house, or at all how he interacts with OP. So let\u2019s not jump to conclusions with anything. \n\nStep parenting is beyond complex, and you don\u2019t understand it or know how to handle it until you\u2019re doing it, and even then, you\u2019ll still be very confused and it\u2019s a lot harder than people think to say the least. And guess what? Yeah.. you\u2019re gonna have some fights. These situations are incredibly weird and sensitive. And yeah, you guessed it, the biological parent tends to be defensive about the child. They commonly defend the child during a situation like this. I believe it is very natural, and is not always due to the step parent\u2019s actions. \n\nNow to dissect the post: \n\nNotice she made it clear her stepfather \u201ccares so much\u201d! She points out he was making lunch (albeit evidently hasn\u2019t done so since two months ago.. A husband who doesn\u2019t really cook much! I\u2019m stunned! \ud83d\ude31 hey, at least he did it that time- I\u2019ll take it- and he was cooking for her nonetheless.) \n\nNotice the difference she pointed out that his biological kids are loafing about at their mother\u2019s house, versus how he chooses to pay close attention to OP. For whatever reason he felt disappointed she was not up sooner and more productive (Keep in mind we do not know. Perhaps they had a previous understanding we are not aware of, although she\u2019s a teenager\u2026 it\u2019s not surprising when teenagers slip up on stuff like that). Sounds to me like he\u2019s trying to be a better father to her than he has been to his biological kids. In an ideal world he does so to all his kids, but life is long and grating, and I think he\u2019s just doing the best he can now. And we aren\u2019t even sure where his biological kids live (regionally). \n\nThen something profound happens I\u2019d like to point out: \n\nHe scolds her. He\u2019s clearly upset enough to do so. Shows he cares. \nThen she cries\u2026 \nTell me the last time you cried when someone scolded you who you didn\u2019t respect or give a crap about? Have you ever noticed we cry in these situations when we get our feelings hurt by someone we respect and care about ourselves? \n\nAs a step parent myself, I don\u2019t see some \u201cbullying\u201d stepfather because he scolded OP. He\u2019s just being a parent, and a caring one at that. This looks to me like an interaction of a family trying their best that respects and cares for one another. And they have a tizzy. And yeah, from the perspective of the child, I imagine it\u2019s very confusing having divorced parents and new parents and household dynamics introduced and maybe she\u2019s blaming herself. But the parents surely mean the best and don\u2019t want her to feel guilty. It\u2019s not her fault at all. \n\nSorry for my freaking novel \ud83d\ude1e no one\u2019s an asshole here lol", "NTA.  \n\nMy stepdad was like this. If you can, please remember that you are not the problem. He may try and make you feel that way, but he's just trying to feel powerful. Make sure your mum knows about any other incidents like this. \n\nSending you love. Stepparents can be pretty evil.", "NTA.  It\u2019s ok kid, none of it is your fault. Sometimes adults suck and it\u2019s not cool he yells at you when your mother isn\u2019t around. It\u2019s definitely not you who made them fight - it\u2019s him. Make sure you always tell your mom what happens between you and him. My children come before my husband and vice versa. I also had a crummy stepdad who put his kids first but then had rules for me and my brother that were outrageous. He was also pissed that my Mom put us before him. He\u2019s been long divorced from us for about 20 years. Good riddance.

You are not in the wrong, as someone who has a stepdad, this kind of behaviour is not ok at all! Im sorry for you and your mom for dealing with him\ud83d\udc94", "NTA\n\nA rule my parents taught me when I was younger was that if an adult ever asks you to keep a secret from one/both of your parents (even if it\u2019s the other parent!!) you go tell them immediately, because adults who are looking out for kids\u2019 best interests don\u2019t tell them things they can\u2019t tell their parents. *[caveats below]\n\nThat can be big, dangerous secrets, or twisted and sick secrets, or the kind of secrets that put too much pressure onto kids. A kid should never be hearing \u201cdon\u2019t tell [other parent] I didn\u2019t do X/said Y/ talked to Z or they\u2019ll be mad!\u201d The kid should never feel like it\u2019s their job to not make their parents mad at each other, because IT ISN\u2019T. If one parent did something that would make the other parent mad if they knew about it, then it is 100% that parent\u2019s fault for ~doing the thing they knew would make their partner mad~, NOT the child\u2019s fault for saying it. \n\nIf the child goes along with the parent inappropriately asking them to keep secrets, they\u2019re A) not at fault for anything, but also B) not keeping everything alright between their parents, because it already isn\u2019t alright. Keeping the inappropriate adult\u2019s secret is just not giving the other parent information they might need to take care of both their kids and themselves the way they want to\u2026 which is what inappropriate parent was going for. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if your step father ever explicitly told you not to tell your mother anything, but waiting until she left the room and whatever other behaviors he\u2019s done that made you know without having to be told that you shouldn\u2019t talk to her *still count*. \n\nAs a child, it is NEVER your fault for *telling* about something an adult *actually chose to do*. \n\nAnd forgive me, I know thirteen isn\u2019t full on child, but at this age the goal is for adults to walk the line when it comes to recognizing your increasing maturity and independence while still protecting you, and this is a place where they should still be full on protecting you. As long as a child is practically and legally dependent on adults, they should NOT be made to feel like they have an equal responsibility in adult relationships. \n\n\n\n*Let\u2019s be clear this rule is for a generally healthy environment- when the parents ARE the problem, the kid does what they have to to stay safe\u2026 though other adults telling them to keep secrets is still something to be very cautious of. This also obviously excludes \u201cdon\u2019t tell [other parent] I [have a genuinely nice surprise][that won\u2019t be a secret soon anyway]!\u201d\n\n[edited immediately after positing to add NTA]", "NTA\n\nI hope you get better, you're so young to experience this.
