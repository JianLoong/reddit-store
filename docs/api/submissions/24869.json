{"id": 24869, "submission_id": "15tpai6", "title": "AITA for telling my mom what my stepfather told me?", "selftext": "I (13f) made my mom and my stepfather fight. I am currently crying while writing this and English isn\u2019t my first language so sorry for mistakes. So today I woke up at 12pm which is unusual for me since my stepfather cares so much. I usually have to wake up before 9am or he will get mad. Well today I didn\u2019t because my phone died in the night so my alarm didn\u2019t go off. I woke up and got really scared because of the time but I did my normal morning routine and around 1pm went downstairs for breakfast. My stepfather was there but didn\u2019t say anything to me because my mom was there. I then went back to my room and watched tiktok not thinking anything. Around 3pm I got hungry again and went down for lunch. My stepfather cooked lunch today for the first time in 2 months. When I was eating lunch my mom left so there was just my stepfather and me. He immediately started raising my voice at me and told me how much I disappointed him today and that I didn\u2019t do anything today. I started holding back tears but didn\u2019t cry. He also told me that he will not respect this kind of behavior and then he left. That\u2019s when I finally broke down. My mom walked in and asked me what happened. I couldn\u2019t say anything because I was shaking so much so I just left to my room. I know you\u2019ll think I am overreacting but I can\u2019t help it. So my mom followed me into my room and that\u2019s when I told her everything. I told her how bad it is for me to be around him and everything. Keep in mind that his real kids that are at their mom\u2019s house are sleeping even longer than I was today but he doesn\u2019t care because they\u2019re his real kids. Then I just heard my stepfather shouting at my mom about how neither of us do anything that he has to cook and everything. About how I never help him even tho I ask him every single day at least 3 times if he wants to help with something and he always says no. So my mom and stepfather ended up fighting and I heard everything. It just hurts me so much seeing that I\u2019m the problem and they\u2019re fighting because of me. My mom stood up for me and I love her so much it\u2019s just my stepfather who always has a problem. So yeah thank you for reading this please tell me if you have any advice.

She has to know what kind of man he is and how he is treating you when she is not around. They are not fighting because of you, that man has issues that have nothing to do with you. He is taking is anger out on you and that is not right or fair. Hang in there, be there for your mom and don't be afraid, she will know what to do.", "NTA\n\nHe chose to speak to you this way.

The fact he waits until your mom isn\u2019t around to get on your case is a huge red flag, too.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not the problem here sweetie, your step father is, I\u2019m glad you told your mum and I\u2019m glad she stood up for you, keep talking to your mum and telling her when this stuff happens, she wants to know ( I\u2019m a mum of a 14 year old and my husband isn\u2019t her dad)", "NTA. It's actually a good thing that they're fighting because it shows your mom truly cares about you and is upset with his behavior towards you.
