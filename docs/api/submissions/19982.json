I think he started doing it to get his dad\u2019s attention but he\u2019d never admit it. In the past he\u2019s gotten in trouble with the police but his dad would always get him out of it and the only consequences he really had was his dad cutting him off for a month one time. He eventually stopped himself after his dad started working on repairing their relationship.\n\nI don\u2019t know why after 3 years he decided to race again. He invited me but he told me we were going to a party because he knows I don\u2019t like the races. I begged him not to race but his friends were encouraging him and everybody was acting like I was worrying over nothing and that I wasn\u2019t a supportive girlfriend. I even tried to use the fact that his dad would be disappointed in him if he raced but he didn\u2019t care because he\u2019s an adult and his dad wouldn\u2019t find out.\n\nI even warned him that I would tell his dad but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop him and I don\u2019t think he thought I actually would. I didn\u2019t want this to become a regular thing and the only person who could actually influence my boyfriend enough to get him to stop is his dad so I filmed him and sent it to his dad. My boyfriend hasn\u2019t spoken to me much since but I know his dad is angry with him and they\u2019re fighting. His cousin told me his dad has threatened to cut him off for good and that his friends are telling him to leave me over this.\n\nI have spoken to his parents and they suggested I give my boyfriend time to calm down as they think he's more angry at himself than me right now but I don't know...\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687102044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cn740/aita_for_filming_my_boyfriend_street_racing_and/", "score": 2636, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her boyfriend was driving. He escaped with minor injuries while she has months if not years of rehabilitation ahead of her. Her life will never be the same. NTA for taking it seriously. But if reporting him to his dad is the only way you can get him to stop, the harsh truth is that he doesn\u2019t respect your opinion and this relationship is probably doomed anyway.", "NTA. I can smell all the blame shifting coming your way. Your boyfriend didn\u2019t disclose where you two were actually going, and when you tried to discourage him to not continue racing, he does anyways. What a unsupportive gf you are for wanting your bf to stop an illegal, extremely dangerous and damaging activity to your bf\u2019s physical health and relationship with his father!! It sounds like your boyfriend and his friends are pretty immature, but so are most people who street race. If he leaves you over this, I\u2019d say you are dodging a bullet. He can\u2019t see the value you have on his health, safety, and important interpersonal relationships.", "Nta. You could have sent the video to the police - you sent it to his dad instead. He should be thanking you.", "NTA any asshole who decides street racing is a good idea deserves whatever consequences come to them.", "The Y T A comments are insane. \"He's a grown-ass adult it's his discretion to do highly illegal and incredibly dangerous things\".\n\nHow dare you film your boyfriend...robbing a bank? Getting behind the wheel incredibly drunk? Being an adult doesn't mean your partner should be okay with you committing crimes that endanger others.\n\nBut I would recommend breaking up. The AH is your boyfriend and every other street racer.\n\nNTA", "You had me at \u201cStreet Racing\u201d. You are NTA, he is.", "NTA because while an adult can make their own decisions that put themselves in danger, they have no right to put other unwilling parties in danger.  \n\nIf he was doing something that could only hurt himself, then yes, you WBTA.  To me this isn\u2019t much different than the choice to drink and drive.", "I live where I can hear the accidents that occur on a sharp curve on a popular street racing street. There is more than one fatality a month there. I once heard an accident and found out two days later the person killed was the boyfriend of a family friend and had graduated from high school the month before.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that girl wishes she had ratted her boyfriend out to his parents - even if he had broken up with her over it - at least he\u2019d be alive.\n\nNta", "NTA\n\nYou warned him and street racing is incredibly dangerous not just to the drivers, but innocent bystanders as well. You'd be T A if you *didn't* do anything.\n\nProbably best to call the police in addition to his dad, although it sounds like he's been caught for it before and the police aren't a deterrent for him at all. You did what you thought was most likely to stop him, and good for you. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Him being an adult \"capable of his own decisions\" is rescinded when he makes choices that put other people in danger. He honestly needs better friends. I would be riddled with anxiety if I had a partner who did shit like this for fun. If he doesn't leave you, you should leave him anyways if this is gonna be a thing for him.

They were big in the hotel lobby and their son had lambos and Ferraris and those fines were peanuts for them. Didn't laugh in his face when the same cop came to tell them he was dead.", "NTA. It was a perfectly reasonable thing to do for someone you care about, especially with you telling him that you will let his father know and he did it anyway. \nThe people saying YTA are ridiculous. Street racing can be addicting and is extremely dangerous, it can cause harm to the racers but more importantly it can cause harm to other who are uninvolved. The whole mindset of \u201cjust let the consequences of his actions deal with it\u201d is the mindset that could lead to disaster. You did the right thing by getting involved. Things will likely be messy for a while, and the relationship may not work out but don\u2019t beat yourself up for that. It had to be done, and hopefully everyone can be better for it in time", "NTA and if he never speaks to you again consider yourself lucky.

NTA", "NTA \n\nThis is one of those posts where the ages aren\u2019t listed, but I\u2019d be shocked to hear ya\u2019ll are older than like, 19. This is teenage shit, because only someone with an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex would be doing something like street racing (so risking the lives of random bystanders) and worrying about daddy cutting them off. \n\nMy N T A switches pretty quick to E S H if you don\u2019t leave this looser. Date someone more mature.", "NTA, a boy who lived across the street from me is paralyzed from the neck down because of street racing. He had a really promising life ahead of him and it changed forever.", "NTA, instead of waiting to see if he leaves you, be proactive. He\u2019s immature and not making safe decisions.

And his friends are agreeing with him? Throw ALL of it away. He disrespected your boundaries. Dismissed your concerns. Lied to you. And now he\u2019s playing the victim. This guy is never going to change. I would send him a break up text then block him. He doesn\u2019t deserve anything more than a \u201cI\u2019m don\u2019t with you. You\u2019re pathetic\u201d text.", "NTA. But break up w him. If you were caught by cops at the scene you\u2019d most likely be held liable. Never date anyone who\u2019s ok to do illegal and even fatal activities that put others and themselves in danger.", "The people voting Y T A absolutely do not know what street racing is. NTA.

Near my home someone on a bike died because people in a car were driving to fast. I would break up the relation myself. I really hate people doing that. Innocent people could die", "Don\u2019t tell his dad. Call the cops when you know it\u2019s happening and break up with anyone who thinks he lives in a Fast & Furious movie. When racing, he is a danger to himself and anyone else on the road.", "He\u2019s \u2018grown up\u2019 enough to make decisions to do things that are dangerous and illegal then he\u2019s grown up enough to live on his own without daddy\u2019s money.  I hope he owns the car and carries his own insurance because if not daddy might be in for a big liability bill, especially since he knows this is happening. Get yourself far far away from this guy.  NTA", "NTA. However, you can't control what stupid things other people do. I tried to warn my BF about racing, and he died decades ago. It ruined my youth. My advice? RUN.", "NTA street racing is illegal and dangerous. \n\nPersonally I would not want to be with someone who acts so recklessly especially after I\u2019d told them of consequences. \n\nBut seriously don\u2019t expect your relationship to recover. He obviously feels he did nothing wrong", "NTA. Normally, I would say telling mommy or daddy on your adult boyfriend would be a shitty thing to do. In this situation, you ARE being a loving supportive girlfriend. In the state I live in, street racing is very popular, but it has also been very deadly.  A vehicle is and should be treated as a weapon. I work in insurance, I can\u2019t tell you how many calls we get of injuries and deaths from racing on the public roads. When your boyfriend kills someone or himself, maybe people will start agreeing with you that it is stupid and playing Russian roulette with lives.", "NTA. You did the right thing by trying to keep your boyfriend from not dying in a street race. Whatever happens, know you did what needed to be done.", "NTA. First of all he put you at risk by lying to you about where you were going. Imagine you get hit by an out of control car or you get arrested if the police show up. He took you somewhere he knew you didn\u2019t want to go. That isn\u2019t a boyfriend. \n\nSecondly being an adult doesn\u2019t mean being free of the consequences of your actions. His choice of action puts other lives and his own life at a much greater risk than just driving around town. \n\nYou really need to evaluate the relationship if he is purposely taking you to a place you absolutely did not want to go to.", "NTA. Just send the film to the proper authority and dump his ass.", "NTA - he is going to kill himself or someone else. Even if you two break up over his immaturity, know that you did the right thing trying to save his life. I hope he wakes up to the truth and ditches his \"friends\" who keep encouraging him. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt.", "NTA he may break up with you. But you may have saved his life in long run. Paul Walker anyone??? I always tell my kids. I love you enough for you to hate me. Meaning I will do what is best for you even if you hate me for it. Keeping them alive was more important. I think you love your boyfriend so much you\u2019d rather keep him alive, even if he ends up hating you. You did a good thing. Might not feel like it now, but you did. If he comes arounds, now he know you won\u2019t take his crap. Good job!  You will make a fantastic wife someday.", "NTA. Street racing is extremely dangerous and telling his Dad is a much better outcome then calling the cops. That being said why are you with him. Someone that wouldn't be able to see that you were looking out for him or do that behavior in the first place isn't worth it. I'd move on.", "NTA he could get seriously injured, he could die, he could kill or injure someone else. He also sounds slightly immature, and it\u2019s messed up that he lied to you about where you were going. I Can tell you care about him, but you may be better off single", "NTA. I ate to be one of those redditors but this is serious ground to break up. He lied about where y'all were going purposely taking you somewhere he knew you didn't want to go then when you do the responsible which is tell someone who can stop him from racing all his friends and him are. Leave this guy and let risk his life street racing all on his own.", "NTA, but your relationship is probably over. Which, if it happens, is for the best.", "NTA. Bf or no, I hate street racing and the dangers of it which are very very serious, and I would have straight up called the cops, so at least u are better than me there!.", "NTA. street racing is stupid and dangerous and he could hurt/kill himself or other people. Anyone who street races is an AH for endangering other people and they deserve exactly what they get", "NTA. \n\nUse whatever action is the least disruptive to stop the behavior.

I\u2019d rather be in trouble with my dad than get arrested, have to hire a lawyer, and end up with a criminal record!", "Leave him.\n\nThe amount of women that are killed due to their boyfriends driving like idiots is incredibly high. I have had a few people in my life who liked to do this sort of stuff and it always ended up in a crash.\n\nSome young lad killed himself last month on my route to work due to it. A young lad I once worked with injured himself and his gf due to this. And someone in college survived but killed 3 passengers due to this.\n\nWhat I've learnt in life is that people don't tend to change unless they really want to.

The car crashed and they were killed as bystanders. He\u2019d just proposed to her that morning. They\u2019ll never get married. Never have their own family. All they get to be is buried next to each other. \n\nSo no. You are NTA. He could KILL someone or himself. If he leaves you over this, that will hurt, but you did the right thing. If he can\u2019t stop putting people in danger for a fucking thrill, he\u2019s a problem.", "The friends are correct but in mirror format: YOU should leave him over being a danger to innocent citizens and to being a repetitive criminal.

He sounds a bit immature.", "Info: How dangerous is street racing and how bad are the consequences? \n\nI'm saying NTA because if anything bad happened to him you would be carrying so much guilt by not telling his parents. I would say though, that he doesn't value his own life and safety, and that hasn't changed over these three years. It was just a pause for him. So, since this will continue, and you can't stop him, you should break it off. For your own sanity.", "NTA.

You need a smarter boyfriend.", "Way back in 1995, I went out clubbing with my friends. \n\nWhen the bar closed, we started walking down to Perkins for some mozzarella sticks and quesadillas, and my friend and I wanted to stop at her apartment to grab some stuff we forgot. \n\nIn all honesty, I do not remember if we had the light to cross, but I do remember that the street was clear. Halfway across, at the median, I looked down the street again, and I could see two sets of headlights just making their way around the turn. Lots of time. \n\nIt was not until we were in the street, almost at the curb that I realized that the cars were moving well beyond the speed limit of 60 kms. \n\nThey were so close that I actually flinched just before I stepped onto the curb. I actually felt the heat of the engine on my calves as the car passed behind me. It was that close.\n\nI turned to my friend. I was going to say \u201cWow that was CLOSE!\u201d\n\nThe words died in my throat. \n\nTo this day, I do not know who screamed. I know it wasn\u2019t me. I don\u2019t know if it was Janelle. What I do know is the way her body folded and flew up the hood, did a full cartwheel in the air. I know her head bounced off the curb, and she landed in the grass just beside the sidewalk. I know the air filled with the smell of burned rubber and the sound of the brakes that came way too late to stop anyone. \n\nWhen I knelt beside her, her eyes were open, but not seeing. Her top was up, exposing her breasts and without thinking, I covered her again. I knew she would be embarrassed when she woke up and realized. Her heart was beating, and I told a guy in a red shirt to call ambulance. My first aid was kicking in when a guy that knelt beside me said her heart just stopped. We did CPR until the ambulance arrived and just as they pulled up, her heart was beating again. \n\nWe helped them put her on the backboard, her skull was unnaturally soft, and the edge of her femur unnaturally sharp under my hands. \n\nI washed her blood off my hands in the waiting room washroom at the hospital, not wanting to meet her parents covered in their daughter\u2019s blood. \n\nThe next morning, we got the call we feared but knew was coming. They were turning off the machines. \n\nThey could only harvest her heart valves. She had a skull fracture, seven broken bones in her neck, broken ribs, both arms and legs. She was 19 years old. She had a crush on one of the cooks at Perkins and she was giggling at the thought of seeing him that night. Janelle was sweet, smart, and kind. The last song we all danced to that night was \u201cI\u2019ll be there for you\u201d - the theme song from Friends. \n\nI still have nightmares. We all do. \n\nThey took 300 metres of skid marks off the asphalt. \n\nThe cars were street racing. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, you're not at fault for caring about your boyfriend's life, or the lives of anyone he could kill.

By doing this, you avoided enabling the behavior which would have led to him likely pursuing racing again.", "Street racing is super dangerous. A friend I had in high school died because of an accident. His car flipped caused a huge accident in my town. Tbh, he is an adult and can make his own decisions.

You did it because you care about him and not out of malicious intent.\n\nEdit: I do think you should have just let him\nReap his own consequences.\n\nEdit 2: I do agree that innocent lives are at stake. But people will do what they want. If he leaves her then he\u2019ll likely just continue his behavior. Some people don\u2019t learn their lesson until something terrible happens.

Apparently the damage was so bad that medics/whoever didn\u2019t immediately realize there was more than one child in the car.\n\nAnother instance was a 19-year-old speeding on the highway. Speed limit was 70, but he was doing at least 90. An SUV changed lanes, the driver thought she had enough space between her car and the crotch rocket, but she ended up hitting him. He died, the community was sad, and for months afterwards I saw decals on cars with his name and DOB/DOD on them. It infuriated me because it wasn\u2019t her fault - he was the one speeding, but his family blamed her. (She was cleared of any wrongdoing.)\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even touch the drinking-while-driving accidents and deaths. \n\nNot only that, but I was hit by a car when I was 14 \u2014 driver wasn\u2019t racing, thank god, because I\u2019d be dead if she was.

He eventually stopped himself after his dad started working on repairing their relationship.\n\nI don\u2019t know why after 3 years he decided to race again. He invited me but he told me we were going to a party because he knows I don\u2019t like the races. I begged him not to race but his friends were encouraging him and everybody was acting like I was worrying over nothing and that I wasn\u2019t a supportive girlfriend. I even tried to use the fact that his dad would be disappointed in him if he raced but he didn\u2019t care because he\u2019s an adult and his dad wouldn\u2019t find out.\n\nI even warned him that I would tell his dad but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop him and I don\u2019t think he thought I actually would. I didn\u2019t want this to become a regular thing and the only person who could actually influence my boyfriend enough to get him to stop is his dad so I filmed him and sent it to his dad.

Until one day he was insistent he drove me to my physical therapy appointment instead of my brother picking me up, within less then 5 minutes of his house (that I stayed the night at) he rolled the car and had us upside down in a ditch.

An off duty cop stopped as he passed by just to ask if we called 911 yet, we said yes and then he just drove off.

You'll be cruising along at 10+ over the speed limit on the interstate when some asshole blows by you at an speed where you literally didn't see them coming and all it would take is a minor fuck up to create complete carnage for everyone in the vicinity.  It's terrifying and so irresponsible.", "Here in Denver where I live? Absolutely, yes it's a thing and it sucks.  I hear them at night and there are always stories coming out about them getting into accidents.  They are absolutely a problem in most good sized cities.", "It definitely is in Providence where my adult kids live. It's a huge safety issue, but the racers are always gone before the police can get there (they change up the location)", "Thanks captain O", "The dad already knew about the street racing and had bailed him out in the past. The boyfriend needs jail time at this point. His life isn\u2019t worth more than all the lives he\u2019s endangering.", "You can say kill instead of TikTok speak. Reddit doesn't censor the word kill unless it's used as a threat.", "I do want to stop them by any means necessary!\n\n\nExcept having a cop put a bullet through their head when they're reaching for their papers...\n\n\nHeck, if someone I knew was killed in self defense when they were *genuinely* a danger to the cop I wouldn't blame the cop at all... but that's not what usually happens, is it?\n\n\nLike, we're on the same side. Drunk driving is evil and should be stopped. \n\n\nPublic, on sight executions by poorly trained, trigger happy rookies? Maybe not.", "If I called the police on someone to try and stop them from driving, and the police murdered them (like they frequently do in the US), I would still have a guilty conscience.", "It may have just been my particular town, or else I just didn't hear of it. More than likely I didn't hear of it cause I kept to myself", "At the primary school where I work, two young boys perished after being struck by a street racer's idiotic car.", "Not only in the Netherlands, also in Germany. And we do have highways which do have areas without speed limit. But people are racing in the city.\n\nLuckily, laws have been changed here and you can even get fined if it appears that you are racing with yourself.\n\nIf someone wants to race, there are more than enough track days on circuits. But you have to pay for them and people don't like to do that.\n\nUsually if someone races or drives under influence and had people on board. Mostly everyone but the driver dies out is mutilated for life.", "That sounds amazing. My dog just petitioned we move to the Netherlands because speeding cars scare him (we lived in a 30kmh zone and they stil drove double that and now we live close to a highway).", "Imagine dating someone who cares more about thier Dad's opinion than yours. No thanks!", "I agree! It also shows his maturity level! NTA", "Yeah and \"unalive\" is the worst tiktok speak term to exist, it's so gross. Like honestly offensive levels of gross lol", "Ngl I'm used to debates on FB, where any word like that could get you banned since it doesn't take context there.", "The cops don't do shit about street racing though. They dont have the manpower to care most of the time. \ud83e\udd37\n\nDad was more effective here.", "It's probably more \"you didn't hang with that circle.\" Almost every town has got this.", "Also, his logic was not \"I'm an adult so what dad says doesn't matter\", itwas \"dad won't find out\""]}
