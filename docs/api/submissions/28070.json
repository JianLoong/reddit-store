It's like blaming someone for being upset at the fact that you didn't do the dishes because they never told you...nobody should tell you to do dishes, they should be done by your own initiative.

If he doesn't want to talk about things in the moment but doesn't want you to bring it up not in the moment, and he wants you to talk about your feelings but responds badly to you talking about your feelings, then it's not that you're doing things badly, it's that he's making it impossible for you to follow his conditions.\n\nWhat you're describing sounds incredibly close to how my abusive ex-husband acted.

I wish there was a way to get him to listen, but when someone doesn't want to hear you, there's no formula or strategy to convince them to listen. You've tried, and it sounds like you've tried as many ways as you can think of, and I know you've given it your all based on how you're talking about it. Does he give your relationship his all? When you tell him how you feel, has he ever listened and changed his behavior, or has he always tuned it into your fault? You matter, and you get to say \"you know what, I'm worth being treated with respect\", because you are. And if he's not interested in giving that to you, you don't have to keep trying", "it's definitely valid to be upset that your partner constantly bails on your plans and refuses to have a proper conversation with you about it - which is what his response to you telling him you feel uncared for is", "It\u2019s called \u201cspeak to your damn partner cuz mind readers don\u2019t exist\u201d.
