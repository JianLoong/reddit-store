Her father was in the same position. Prior to doing the deed, I told him if anything were to happen I would not be getting an abortion. He said he understood. \n\nWhen I got pregnant, he refused any contact with my baby or responsibility. He took things further by telling my friends and his family that I planned the pregnancy to trap him, so they wouldn\u2019t judge his actions. This was untrue. He paid mandatory child support but it wasn\u2019t much. \n\nIt was hard but I love my daughter and wouldn\u2019t change a thing. She\u2019s wonderful and smart and she\u2019s my whole world. \n\nHe reached out to me on Facebook saying he wants to be in his daughters life. He\u2019s married now. I did some stalking online, his wife has frequently posted about her infertility struggle. \n\nI was against it because he\u2019s had no part of her life. It was me who had to drop out of college, work 2 jobs, endure the sleepless nights as a baby and raise her. It was me that kept her belly full and kept her warm. He didn\u2019t give a shit. It was me that endured my friends turning against me and his family\u2019s harassment. And the judgment of society for being a young mom. And now that he wouldn\u2019t be sacrificing his young years, now he\u2019s finished partying, now he\u2019s got his degree and job, and his wife can\u2019t give him kids to complete his picket fence life, he wants the kid I raised for him? Knowing he doesn\u2019t really have to do any work other than pick her up now and then. \n\nI told him my thoughts, and he got mad saying that I chose to have the baby not him, which tipped things over for me. I asked him to prove he thought about her, eg a college fund he\u2019s paid into for a while with her in mind or car money. He did not, which again proved to me he only gave a shit when he couldn\u2019t make more kids. \n\nI spoke to my daughter but I told her the type of person her father is. I told her he has nothing for her, and I was honest about the fact his wife is infertile so he is reaching out. I told her everything and reiterated basically everything I said in the post. \n\nI told her to think about it, I said I\u2019d support her knowing him, but I affirmed he is not a nice person and his intentions are not where we would want. She chose to not know him. \n\nAfter I informed him he got mad. He said I ruined his chance to know her, that I\u2019m denying her a father, I told him he was the one that did that. \n\nMy mother told me I shouldn\u2019t have poisoned his image to her, that she probably feels rejected all over again and she\u2019s probably hurting. I now feel like I have done wrong by her. AITA?\n\nEdit: she is 16 now\n\nEdit 2: if it wasn\u2019t for the infertile wife, and lack of college fund or car money (showing evidence he had at least thought about her) then I probably wouldn\u2019t have said anything to her about what he is like.

It is one thing for him to give up parental rights and for it to remain that way, but what he is doing is treating her like she is some sort of trend of the month.

How convenient he has a back up child! Now she means something to him.\n\nYou told her he was interested in pursuing a relationship with her and you'd support whatever decision she made. He hasn't been around for her entire life... he rejected her.   She's well aware of it. You were frank with her but I feel she needs to know what she's getting into because suddenly she's become a convenience. Had his wife been able to conceive, I wonder if he would still be interested in pursuing a relationship with her? I feel you did the right thing.", "NTA but that could change depending on how old the daughter is.\n\nEdit: at 16, she's old enough to make her own decision on that.\n\nIf she were 12 and you framed it as \"your daddy is a bad man, do you want to meet him?\", it would be an entirely different story.", "Part of me wants to say E-S-H, because you did poison her views of him, but who could blame you for that? He didn't give a darn for 16 years, and what he did when you were pregnant is indefensible. You didn't deny her a father, he did. He is nothing but a sperm donor and a stranger to her. Maybe someday she will want to know him as an adult, but I can't imagine he will ever be her dad.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA, but lawyer up and make sure your custody and support agreements are ironclad.", "NTA - If I was her I would want to know about this. It's not an ideal situation but neither is him abandoning her. It was his abandonment that is to blame for this whole situation. She would have felt even more abandoned by him somehow and at some point and he would have hurt her more if he pretended to care about her just because his wife is infertile. Honestly, it's unfortunate that his wife doesn't seem to know what kind of person he is. \n\nHe is a selfish person and doesn't care about that and she would eventually pick up on that as he would inevitably show his selfishness by it coming out another way and he could harm her further.\n\nHe selfishly only wants to be the 'fun dad' when it's convenient for him and doesn't care about taking responsibility of a child. He knew what he was getting into as you said before the deed that you would not get an abortion and if he didn't want that, he shouldn't have done the deed with you and should have found someone else who also agreed they didn't want children.", "Based on the age of your daughter, I have to say that you\u2019re NTA. Your daughter is old enough to take what you have to say and form her own opinions. If you had insisted that she not know him, I would\u2019ve said Y T A. But you just gave your opinion, said what happened from your perspective, and let her make the final decision. Sure your description wasn\u2019t flattering, but to be fair how could you expect it to be anything but?", "NTA.

You should also discuss with your daughter how she will stay grounded while being showered with affection and money in this scenario.", "INFO: how old is she?", "Info: how long had you been with the father prior to pregnancy?", "NTA. This was a hard one though. If he really wanted to know her, he had 16 years to give more than the mandatory child support fees. Just be careful that you aren\u2019t giving anything but the facts to her because if he\u2019s still paying child support he could take you to court and fight you for custody or tell the court that you\u2019re coaching her not to talk to him.\n\nFrom a mental health perspective, you may want to connect her with her father virtually with you present and offer your daughter an out if she needs. At 16, she should understand that you were the one who took care of her and it\u2019ll be better for her to come to the conclusion herself.", "If she is 16 i would allow her to make that decision, if she knows all the facts she can make an informed decision for herself.", "NTA. Your red flags about him are valid, he\u2019s nothing but a sperm donor who was forced to pay minimal child support. Yes people make mistakes etc. but this not something that can be easily overlooked because he\u2019s suddenly ready to be in her life after 16 years. I would have told my child the truth as well, she\u2019s old enough to understand and what\u2019s to say that he won\u2019t walk away again when it\u2019s inconvenient for him.

You\u2019re absolutely right he doesn\u2019t really want a relationship with her but his wife can\u2019t have kids so he decided hey I have a kid she can mother.", "NTA. As you said, you were the one who did all of the work; his life was relatively carefree and unaffected by your choice to have and raise your daughter.

And if you have issues with him - you need to resolve them directly with him.\n\nAs for how he was, he may have changed: people do grow and evolve. Especially from teens to adults.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell on this without knowing how long ago everything happened.", "NTA", "NTA.

That wasn't nice at all. And to pay the bare minimum.\n\nHowever, you suck for not letting her form her own opinions of her father - especially when you yourself are making assumptions as to why he's reaching out now. You assume it's because he can't have more kids, when it could be something he's been mulling over for a while, maybe the whole process of TTC has been making him wonder about his child, maybe he's just grown up and realised he wants a relationship with her, etc.", "ESH.

You don't seem to be considering her potential emotional needs to know her dad. I'm sure that in all other ways you do a great job of caring for her, but this definitely sounds like you were putting yourself first. Lack of college fund is just an excuse.

This is long, so sorry in advance. \n\nMy dad pretty much abandoned my sister and I when my parents got divorced (right before we left to actual safety away from him he told me that I was the primary cause of their failing marriage and if I didn't exist things would have been better for him. Real charmer, that guy!) And he only ever reached out to see us (we left when I was 12... this would have been around the time I was 15 or so - and he refused to go to any divorce court dates because he genuinely believed that they couldn't get divorced if he didn't show up and we would be forced to return to live with him 3 hours away again. In any anyone was wondering I got my intelligence from my mom lmao but since he didn't show up and had been jailed a few times for public intoxication, dui, and drugs, and was also essentially homeless for a while, he jad supervised visitstion at my grandparents house with my mom there only) was shortly after he got remarried. Fun fact: he didn't even invite us to his wedding. He called for the first time in about a year and a half (prior to that he stopped calling because he called to cuss me out drunkenly one night and my friend I was with at the time called him a shit excuse for a dad and he didn't want to talk to me anymore apparently lol) to let us know he was getting married next week. A few months later he decided they were going to visit us... they drove 3.5 hours to see us. They stayed for 2.5 hours. Then they decided it was \"too awkward\" and that they were leaving to go to the mall, then go fishing and camping for the rest of the weekend. They didn't even let us know when they left town. \n\nI remember telling my mom I didn't want to see that man prior to him showing up. My little sister didn't really know him at all because she's 5 years younger than me. My grandparents however insisted that we saw him because maybe this was him starting to make an effort... I already knew what to expect from his visit but my grandparents reemed me out *hard* for trying to explain that to my baby sister (and before anyone chimes in and asks where my mom was in all of this - she frequently worked night shifts at a hotel, which was one of the only jobs she could get in our tiny little town after trying to re-enter the workforce post-divorce, because my dad didn't let her work from the time I was born until they split. Not even when he quit his job to drink two 30-packs of beer a day lmao and he wasn't allowed to contact my mom so if he wanted to talk to us he had to go through my grandparents first, hence how all this played out lol.)\n\nI had to spend some time after the visit with my mom explaining to my sister that yeah, my dad didn't really have our best interests at heart. He got remarried and wanted his new wife to think that he was a good dad and was being kept away from his kids by his awful ex and that's why he wasn't involved. \n\nIronically, I have zero contact with that asshole anymore because he deleted me off his Facebook right before my high school graduation invites went out. He asked for info on it and an invite for him and his new wife. I said they hadn't told us if they were capping our invites at a certain number yet (all of this on a public Facebook status. He wasn't even classy enough to do this through dms lol) and since I didn't actually know his wife, I guess I'd extend the invite to him, but I wasn't inviting her unless I knew I wouldn't have a limit because there were people I cared about I wanted to invite first. \n\nHe told me thay was rude and how do you think she would feel and I was like \"I don't know or particularly care because I don't know her. Plus wouldn't it be awkward for you guys? You didn't want to hang out the last time you were here because it was awkward and I imagine we will just have a small get together with family after my graduation anyways so I'm sure thay wouldn't be comfortable for yall.\" He told me they weren't planning on actually hanging out. They'd watch me walk the stage and then go camp on the beach and go home the next day. I said that if that was the case it was better they didn't come at all, and he cussed me out and blocked me. His wife added me shortly after and said that my dad was just being silly and grumpy and she'd be sure to show him all my posts. I told her I'd rather she didn't, because he had made his choices and I wasn't interested in having a relationship with him when he just wanted to use my existence for a free camping trip. She called me a b**** and blocked me... good riddance lol. \n\nMy sister still has him on Facebook though. He wishes her a happy birthday sometime around the week of her birthday, because he doesn't actually know what day it is. She asked and he guessed like two days off, lol. She didn't even bother inviting him to get graduation and I think she hides her posts from him. \n\nAll of this to say, OP - having a dad that only cares about you because it's convenient and makes him look good can leave some emotional scars even when they're really young. Your daughter is definitely old enough to understand that her \"dad\" is only seeking a relationship with her because she now is his only chance. It's purely a relationship for selfish reasons (look honey we can't have our own kids but I'll get a kid for us to raise okay? Don't worry!) And you daughter absolutely deserved to know the reality of it. It's a kindness to be able to tell her you know he has only just decided he wants kids and is only reaching out because he can't have them with his wife, and that he's likely not interested in your daughter as a person - he just wants her to be an easy stand-in to fill the gaps in his cute perfect little life and to make him look good to his wife. \n\nYour daughter absolutely deserved to know what his likely intentions were (and if nothing else to know the circumstances that lead to her conception and the events playing up to him finally wanting to meet her, because that paints a picture in and of itself) so that she could make her own choices. I made my own choices around that age, based on the reality of the situation at hand. Your daughter is old enough to understand what her father is doing, and definitely old enough to make her own decisions on whether or not she felt like trying to have a relationship with him. Setting her up with a clear cut scene as to what lead him to suddenly contact her (as well as providing proof he hadn't really... thought about her/cared about her wellbeing/wanted to provide for her in any way at all prior to wanting kids with his wife...) also would have allowed her to, should she have wanted to meet him, set her own expectations for how things might play out. \n\nAt the end of the day? That's a kindness. She's old enough to understand that people do things for selfish reasons, and old enough go decide if she wants to pursue a relationship anyway. She didn't - but you gave her the option to, with a presumably honest opinion as to why you thought it might not be a great choice personally. As long as she felt supported in whatever decision she made, I think you did the right thing.", "Soft NTA\u2026 barely\u2026. 16 years man!!!", "NTA He got what he wished for - you did the work and effort and shouldered the expense, so it's your call.

I dont blame my mother for not telling me that info though, it is a difficult decision to make. If she decides to pursue a relationship with her father, be supportive.
