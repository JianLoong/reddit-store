Her father was in the same position. Prior to doing the deed, I told him if anything were to happen I would not be getting an abortion. He said he understood. \n\nWhen I got pregnant, he refused any contact with my baby or responsibility. He took things further by telling my friends and his family that I planned the pregnancy to trap him, so they wouldn\u2019t judge his actions. This was untrue. He paid mandatory child support but it wasn\u2019t much. \n\nIt was hard but I love my daughter and wouldn\u2019t change a thing. She\u2019s wonderful and smart and she\u2019s my whole world. \n\nHe reached out to me on Facebook saying he wants to be in his daughters life. He\u2019s married now. I did some stalking online, his wife has frequently posted about her infertility struggle. \n\nI was against it because he\u2019s had no part of her life. It was me who had to drop out of college, work 2 jobs, endure the sleepless nights as a baby and raise her. It was me that kept her belly full and kept her warm. He didn\u2019t give a shit. It was me that endured my friends turning against me and his family\u2019s harassment. And the judgment of society for being a young mom. And now that he wouldn\u2019t be sacrificing his young years, now he\u2019s finished partying, now he\u2019s got his degree and job, and his wife can\u2019t give him kids to complete his picket fence life, he wants the kid I raised for him? Knowing he doesn\u2019t really have to do any work other than pick her up now and then. \n\nI told him my thoughts, and he got mad saying that I chose to have the baby not him, which tipped things over for me. I asked him to prove he thought about her, eg a college fund he\u2019s paid into for a while with her in mind or car money. He did not, which again proved to me he only gave a shit when he couldn\u2019t make more kids. \n\nI spoke to my daughter but I told her the type of person her father is. I told her he has nothing for her, and I was honest about the fact his wife is infertile so he is reaching out. I told her everything and reiterated basically everything I said in the post. \n\nI told her to think about it, I said I\u2019d support her knowing him, but I affirmed he is not a nice person and his intentions are not where we would want. She chose to not know him. \n\nAfter I informed him he got mad. He said I ruined his chance to know her, that I\u2019m denying her a father, I told him he was the one that did that. \n\nMy mother told me I shouldn\u2019t have poisoned his image to her, that she probably feels rejected all over again and she\u2019s probably hurting. I now feel like I have done wrong by her. AITA?\n\nEdit: she is 16 now\n\nEdit 2: if it wasn\u2019t for the infertile wife, and lack of college fund or car money (showing evidence he had at least thought about her) then I probably wouldn\u2019t have said anything to her about what he is like.

It is one thing for him to give up parental rights and for it to remain that way, but what he is doing is treating her like she is some sort of trend of the month. What is going to happen when he realizes she is a complex, multilayered human with a lot of thoughts and feelings and likely a lot of negative feelings towards him?\n\nI wouldn't trust him with properly taking care of an animal, let alone a child.", "NTA He chose not to be a part of her life, paid a minimal amount of child support, painted you as the pariah, and because he and his wife are struggling to conceive, now he's interested in her after 16 years? How convenient he has a back up child! Now she means something to him.\n\nYou told her he was interested in pursuing a relationship with her and you'd support whatever decision she made. He hasn't been around for her entire life... he rejected her.   She's well aware of it. You were frank with her but I feel she needs to know what she's getting into because suddenly she's become a convenience. Had his wife been able to conceive, I wonder if he would still be interested in pursuing a relationship with her? I feel you did the right thing.", "NTA but that could change depending on how old the daughter is.\n\nEdit: at 16, she's old enough to make her own decision on that.\n\nIf she were 12 and you framed it as \"your daddy is a bad man, do you want to meet him?\", it would be an entirely different story.", "Part of me wants to say E-S-H, because you did poison her views of him, but who could blame you for that? He didn't give a darn for 16 years, and what he did when you were pregnant is indefensible. You didn't deny her a father, he did. He is nothing but a sperm donor and a stranger to her. Maybe someday she will want to know him as an adult, but I can't imagine he will ever be her dad.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA, but lawyer up and make sure your custody and support agreements are ironclad.", "NTA - If I was her I would want to know about this. It's not an ideal situation but neither is him abandoning her. It was his abandonment that is to blame for this whole situation. She would have felt even more abandoned by him somehow and at some point and he would have hurt her more if he pretended to care about her just because his wife is infertile. Honestly, it's unfortunate that his wife doesn't seem to know what kind of person he is. \n\nHe is a selfish person and doesn't care about that and she would eventually pick up on that as he would inevitably show his selfishness by it coming out another way and he could harm her further.\n\nHe selfishly only wants to be the 'fun dad' when it's convenient for him and doesn't care about taking responsibility of a child. He knew what he was getting into as you said before the deed that you would not get an abortion and if he didn't want that, he shouldn't have done the deed with you and should have found someone else who also agreed they didn't want children.", "Based on the age of your daughter, I have to say that you\u2019re NTA. Your daughter is old enough to take what you have to say and form her own opinions. If you had insisted that she not know him, I would\u2019ve said Y T A. But you just gave your opinion, said what happened from your perspective, and let her make the final decision. Sure your description wasn\u2019t flattering, but to be fair how could you expect it to be anything but?", "NTA. It sounds like this couple want to make up for their own lack of children through your daughter. You should also discuss with your daughter how she will stay grounded while being showered with affection and money in this scenario.", "INFO: how old is she?", "Info: how long had you been with the father prior to pregnancy?", "NTA. This was a hard one though. If he really wanted to know her, he had 16 years to give more than the mandatory child support fees. Just be careful that you aren\u2019t giving anything but the facts to her because if he\u2019s still paying child support he could take you to court and fight you for custody or tell the court that you\u2019re coaching her not to talk to him.\n\nFrom a mental health perspective, you may want to connect her with her father virtually with you present and offer your daughter an out if she needs. At 16, she should understand that you were the one who took care of her and it\u2019ll be better for her to come to the conclusion herself.", "If she is 16 i would allow her to make that decision, if she knows all the facts she can make an informed decision for herself.", "NTA. Your red flags about him are valid, he\u2019s nothing but a sperm donor who was forced to pay minimal child support. Yes people make mistakes etc. but this not something that can be easily overlooked because he\u2019s suddenly ready to be in her life after 16 years. I would have told my child the truth as well, she\u2019s old enough to understand and what\u2019s to say that he won\u2019t walk away again when it\u2019s inconvenient for him. He has a lot of amends to make to you and your daughter before you can ever consider him to be in your lives.", "NTA, he doesn\u2019t get to waltz in now because he feels like being a Dad. \n\nInfertility is horrible and I feel for anyone going through it BUT that doesn\u2019t give him the right to go oh well I\u2019ll go back to that other kid I had. \n\nI understand why you told your daughter and I think the fact that you\u2019re saying to her that you will support her if she wants a relationship with him reaffirms that you\u2019re not at fault here. \n\nI hope that if she chooses to, he does step up to the plate and make up for lost time.", "NTA he waited 16yrs! You\u2019re absolutely right he doesn\u2019t really want a relationship with her but his wife can\u2019t have kids so he decided hey I have a kid she can mother.", "NTA. As you said, you were the one who did all of the work; his life was relatively carefree and unaffected by your choice to have and raise your daughter. Sixteen is old enough for her to make her own decisions about whether she wants him in her life, and she is obviously mature enough to handle the truth about both her beginnings and the kind of person he is.", "This one\u2019s hard to judge - I think it depends on your intentions.\n\nI\u2019m a soft NTA if you\u2019re genuinely just trying to protect your daughter, and I get how hard the single parent journey is; especially when it happens young. \n\nHowever, there does seem to be a flavour of resentment on this - around how he hurt you, and if that\u2019s driving your conversations with her, then there\u2019s some ah behaviour on your side.\n\nShe will need to make her own decisions about her father. And if you have issues with him - you need to resolve them directly with him.\n\nAs for how he was, he may have changed: people do grow and evolve. Especially from teens to adults.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell on this without knowing how long ago everything happened.", "NTA", "NTA.

He's a sperm donor, nothing more.\n\nStay strong\ud83d\udc4d", "well... legally speaking if he's still paying legal child support, he could take you to court for something called \"alienation of affection\" the courts call this anything where one parent says something that could be considered \"poisoning\" a child against a parent who is on good terms with their child support, and he could use that to get visitation rights assuming his state will let him try to get them.\n\nI don't think you are an asshole.  not for this.  you warned your child about a potential dangerous manipulator.  but it might open you up to losing some limited parental rights if he choses a good lawyer and has the right laws to back him.\n\nPlease be careful when dealing with an angry ex- as long as he's paying his legally agreed upon child support he has a lever to pry into your life.  i'm not saying she has to see him, i just don't want you to risk your family over some petty asshole trying to weasel his way back into your life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas a sidenote; I hate to say this, but a guy knowing you're keeping a child if you get knocked up, isn't the same thing as him agreeing to be the father.  now speaking as a responsible adult, i'd take that as a warning to make sure to buy my own condoms, if i'm not ready to be a father, and to be extra careful about it but at 19yo most guys aren't responsible or adult enough to think beyond their pp.  I know your mad at what he did after you got pregnant but he wasn't married to you... so he had little obligation to stick with you.  again, don't get me wrong.  i'm not siding with him on this.  just saying some of your wrath at him, is a bit unjustified (only some, him claiming you baby trapped him was over the line, unless of course you told him you were on birth control, and weren't in which case you sorta did baby trap him, though from your story that doesn't sound like what happened.)", "While he is a major AH for doing what he did to you and your daughter.

Instead of putting down the father, you should have simply asked your daughter if she wanted any communication with him.", "NTA", "YTA. He sounds like a terrible excuse for a father, but like it or not, you still chose to have this man\u2019s baby and he IS her father - she will never have any other.

Of course she\u2019s going to say she doesn\u2019t want to meet him when it\u2019s so incredibly obvious YOU don\u2019t want her to meet him.

Which is his right.\n\nAs is your right to not have the abortion, but then you accept responsibility for everything that comes with it. That was your choice. \n\n16 years is a long time - people change and grow and realise that maybe they've made mistakes, and and and. Especially when you're looking back at something that happened when you're 19 years old.\n\nHe sucks because it obviously wasn't right if him to tell people you tried to baby trap him and thus, add to your judgement plate. That wasn't nice at all. And to pay the bare minimum.\n\nHowever, you suck for not letting her form her own opinions of her father - especially when you yourself are making assumptions as to why he's reaching out now. You assume it's because he can't have more kids, when it could be something he's been mulling over for a while, maybe the whole process of TTC has been making him wonder about his child, maybe he's just grown up and realised he wants a relationship with her, etc.", "ESH. Your daughter has half his DNA. Speaking so poorly of him may damage her self image. I think it's good to protect her, but be tactful.", "YTA From the way you've written about the situation, it sounds like the reason you told daughter all the bad things about her father was because of YOUR hurt feelings. You don't seem to be considering her potential emotional needs to know her dad. I'm sure that in all other ways you do a great job of caring for her, but this definitely sounds like you were putting yourself first. Lack of college fund is just an excuse.

That is what happened I don\u2019t know what to tell you, other than it was a pharmacist who told me the chances were slim and not to worry about a morning after. \n\nAgain, please don\u2019t insult single moms for choosing to have a baby or for how that baby was conceived, it\u2019s rude. Men don\u2019t get shit for it. I\u2019m glad I had my baby she\u2019s my world.", "She didn't break the condom,it broke during intimacy probably.\n\nHow is that her fault ?", "Op wrote a comment but changed it, she said they used a Condom and it broke, and she missed taking the pill and the dr said not to worry about it. Seems legit", "Again, I doubt a medical professional would give that advice as it\u2019s wrong. You could have googled it to find the information. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t believe I insulted single mums. Didn\u2019t say you regret your kid.\n\nYou avoided to answer the question, did you guys discuss being parents together? \n\nDid he know the condom broke, that you missed the pill, that you went to the pharmacist and what the pharmacist said? \n\nDid you take him with you to the pharmacist?", "Didn\u2019t say it was her fault the condom broke.\nBut when a condom breaks it\u2019s obvious, and you should know emergency contraception is the option. But she also said that she missed the pill - which if the normal pill, missing one and you will still be protected. The mini pill - you have to take that in a four hour window or it isn\u2019t effective at all. The morning after pill can be taken with both pills. A pharmacist would never advise the chances were \u201cslim\u201d for pregnancy."]}
