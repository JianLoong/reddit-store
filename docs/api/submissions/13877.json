Her father was in the same position. Prior to doing the deed, I told him if anything were to happen I would not be getting an abortion. He said he understood. \n\nWhen I got pregnant, he refused any contact with my baby or responsibility. He took things further by telling my friends and his family that I planned the pregnancy to trap him, so they wouldn\u2019t judge his actions. This was untrue. He paid mandatory child support but it wasn\u2019t much. \n\nIt was hard but I love my daughter and wouldn\u2019t change a thing. She\u2019s wonderful and smart and she\u2019s my whole world. \n\nHe reached out to me on Facebook saying he wants to be in his daughters life. He\u2019s married now. I did some stalking online, his wife has frequently posted about her infertility struggle. \n\nI was against it because he\u2019s had no part of her life. It was me who had to drop out of college, work 2 jobs, endure the sleepless nights as a baby and raise her. It was me that kept her belly full and kept her warm. He didn\u2019t give a shit. It was me that endured my friends turning against me and his family\u2019s harassment. And the judgment of society for being a young mom. And now that he wouldn\u2019t be sacrificing his young years, now he\u2019s finished partying, now he\u2019s got his degree and job, and his wife can\u2019t give him kids to complete his picket fence life, he wants the kid I raised for him? Knowing he doesn\u2019t really have to do any work other than pick her up now and then. \n\nI told him my thoughts, and he got mad saying that I chose to have the baby not him, which tipped things over for me. I asked him to prove he thought about her, eg a college fund he\u2019s paid into for a while with her in mind or car money. He did not, which again proved to me he only gave a shit when he couldn\u2019t make more kids. \n\nI spoke to my daughter but I told her the type of person her father is. I told her he has nothing for her, and I was honest about the fact his wife is infertile so he is reaching out. I told her everything and reiterated basically everything I said in the post. \n\nI told her to think about it, I said I\u2019d support her knowing him, but I affirmed he is not a nice person and his intentions are not where we would want. She chose to not know him. \n\nAfter I informed him he got mad. He said I ruined his chance to know her, that I\u2019m denying her a father, I told him he was the one that did that. \n\nMy mother told me I shouldn\u2019t have poisoned his image to her, that she probably feels rejected all over again and she\u2019s probably hurting. I now feel like I have done wrong by her. AITA?\n\nEdit: she is 16 now\n\nEdit 2: if it wasn\u2019t for the infertile wife, and lack of college fund or car money (showing evidence he had at least thought about her) then I probably wouldn\u2019t have said anything to her about what he is like. But to me those were red flags\n\nEDIT 3: FAQ\n\nhe never told me he didn\u2019t want kids, he didn\u2019t tell me he wouldn\u2019t stick around for the kid when I told him I wouldn\u2019t abort before anything. \n\nDespite this I\u2019m NOT MAD HE LEFT. I am mad he returned  for the WRONG REASONS which could be harmful to my daughter. \n\nI am not answering questions on how I got pregnant as this is not relevant. The amount of people I\u2019ve had comment \u201cwell were you on birth control?\u201d and the lack of \u201cwell did he wrap it up?\u201d  If you\u2019re trying to find out if I poked holes or lied about taking the pill, I did not. If you\u2019re about to accuse of having unprotected sex, again, I did not. \n\nDo not ask why I didn\u2019t abort my daughter or refer to her as a consequence. This is rude and you know it.

He hasn't been around for her entire life... he rejected her.   She's well aware of it.

Honestly, it's unfortunate that his wife doesn't seem to know what kind of person he is. \n\nHe is a selfish person and doesn't care about that and she would eventually pick up on that as he would inevitably show his selfishness by it coming out another way and he could harm her further.\n\nHe selfishly only wants to be the 'fun dad' when it's convenient for him and doesn't care about taking responsibility of a child.

This is long, so sorry in advance. \n\nMy dad pretty much abandoned my sister and I when my parents got divorced (right before we left to actual safety away from him he told me that I was the primary cause of their failing marriage and if I didn't exist things would have been better for him. Real charmer, that guy!) And he only ever reached out to see us (we left when I was 12... this would have been around the time I was 15 or so - and he refused to go to any divorce court dates because he genuinely believed that they couldn't get divorced if he didn't show up and we would be forced to return to live with him 3 hours away again. In any anyone was wondering I got my intelligence from my mom lmao but since he didn't show up and had been jailed a few times for public intoxication, dui, and drugs, and was also essentially homeless for a while, he jad supervised visitstion at my grandparents house with my mom there only) was shortly after he got remarried. Fun fact: he didn't even invite us to his wedding. He called for the first time in about a year and a half (prior to that he stopped calling because he called to cuss me out drunkenly one night and my friend I was with at the time called him a shit excuse for a dad and he didn't want to talk to me anymore apparently lol) to let us know he was getting married next week. A few months later he decided they were going to visit us... they drove 3.5 hours to see us. They stayed for 2.5 hours. Then they decided it was \"too awkward\" and that they were leaving to go to the mall, then go fishing and camping for the rest of the weekend. They didn't even let us know when they left town. \n\nI remember telling my mom I didn't want to see that man prior to him showing up. My little sister didn't really know him at all because she's 5 years younger than me. My grandparents however insisted that we saw him because maybe this was him starting to make an effort... I already knew what to expect from his visit but my grandparents reemed me out *hard* for trying to explain that to my baby sister (and before anyone chimes in and asks where my mom was in all of this - she frequently worked night shifts at a hotel, which was one of the only jobs she could get in our tiny little town after trying to re-enter the workforce post-divorce, because my dad didn't let her work from the time I was born until they split. Not even when he quit his job to drink two 30-packs of beer a day lmao and he wasn't allowed to contact my mom so if he wanted to talk to us he had to go through my grandparents first, hence how all this played out lol.)\n\nI had to spend some time after the visit with my mom explaining to my sister that yeah, my dad didn't really have our best interests at heart. He got remarried and wanted his new wife to think that he was a good dad and was being kept away from his kids by his awful ex and that's why he wasn't involved. \n\nIronically, I have zero contact with that asshole anymore because he deleted me off his Facebook right before my high school graduation invites went out. He asked for info on it and an invite for him and his new wife. I said they hadn't told us if they were capping our invites at a certain number yet (all of this on a public Facebook status. He wasn't even classy enough to do this through dms lol) and since I didn't actually know his wife, I guess I'd extend the invite to him, but I wasn't inviting her unless I knew I wouldn't have a limit because there were people I cared about I wanted to invite first. \n\nHe told me thay was rude and how do you think she would feel and I was like \"I don't know or particularly care because I don't know her. Plus wouldn't it be awkward for you guys? You didn't want to hang out the last time you were here because it was awkward and I imagine we will just have a small get together with family after my graduation anyways so I'm sure thay wouldn't be comfortable for yall.\" He told me they weren't planning on actually hanging out. They'd watch me walk the stage and then go camp on the beach and go home the next day. I said that if that was the case it was better they didn't come at all, and he cussed me out and blocked me. His wife added me shortly after and said that my dad was just being silly and grumpy and she'd be sure to show him all my posts. I told her I'd rather she didn't, because he had made his choices and I wasn't interested in having a relationship with him when he just wanted to use my existence for a free camping trip. She called me a b**** and blocked me... good riddance lol. \n\nMy sister still has him on Facebook though. He wishes her a happy birthday sometime around the week of her birthday, because he doesn't actually know what day it is. She asked and he guessed like two days off, lol. She didn't even bother inviting him to get graduation and I think she hides her posts from him. \n\nAll of this to say, OP - having a dad that only cares about you because it's convenient and makes him look good can leave some emotional scars even when they're really young. Your daughter is definitely old enough to understand that her \"dad\" is only seeking a relationship with her because she now is his only chance. It's purely a relationship for selfish reasons (look honey we can't have our own kids but I'll get a kid for us to raise okay? Don't worry!) And you daughter absolutely deserved to know the reality of it. It's a kindness to be able to tell her you know he has only just decided he wants kids and is only reaching out because he can't have them with his wife, and that he's likely not interested in your daughter as a person - he just wants her to be an easy stand-in to fill the gaps in his cute perfect little life and to make him look good to his wife. \n\nYour daughter absolutely deserved to know what his likely intentions were (and if nothing else to know the circumstances that lead to her conception and the events playing up to him finally wanting to meet her, because that paints a picture in and of itself) so that she could make her own choices. I made my own choices around that age, based on the reality of the situation at hand. Your daughter is old enough to understand what her father is doing, and definitely old enough to make her own decisions on whether or not she felt like trying to have a relationship with him. Setting her up with a clear cut scene as to what lead him to suddenly contact her (as well as providing proof he hadn't really... thought about her/cared about her wellbeing/wanted to provide for her in any way at all prior to wanting kids with his wife...) also would have allowed her to, should she have wanted to meet him, set her own expectations for how things might play out. \n\nAt the end of the day? That's a kindness. She's old enough to understand that people do things for selfish reasons, and old enough go decide if she wants to pursue a relationship anyway. She didn't - but you gave her the option to, with a presumably honest opinion as to why you thought it might not be a great choice personally. As long as she felt supported in whatever decision she made, I think you did the right thing.", "Soft NTA\u2026 barely\u2026. 16 years man!!!", "NTA He got what he wished for - you did the work and effort and shouldered the expense, so it's your call.

I've been in her shoes and I was so almost desperate to just have him in my life. It is quite clear that he has ulterior motives (infertile wife) and this can lead to possible trauma for your daughter. She needs to be able to make an informed decision. If I knew certain information about my father beforehand, it wouldve saved me a LOT of trouble the future had planned for me. I dont blame my mother for not telling me that info though, it is a difficult decision to make. If she decides to pursue a relationship with her father, be supportive. No sly comments, no detective work. You need to be careful not to push her into his arms. Based on experience, there is a chance he could end up feeding her little lies to make you look bad.

She did lay everything out for her daughter and she isn't going to lie and pretend her dad is genuinely interested because he's not, the proof is that he's never put anything aside for her this whole time.", "Similar yet opposite take here. Unless I see otherwise, I\u2019m going to assume the husband and wife are on the same page. She\u2019s 16. Sure, maybe he hid it really well, but I\u2019m not rushing to give her the benefit of the doubt when at the end of the day she still suddenly wants access to a 16 year old. I don\u2019t see a surprise almost adult child being a nice consolation prize for infertility. She knows.", "It\u2019s also dangerous to hide the truth from kids. My mother never told me what the full situation of the custody agreement was and never corrected any impressions my dad gave to because she didn\u2019t want to hurt me by revealing he was not just a bad parent like I could already see, but an absolutely crap one.\n\nIn turn dad manipulated me a lot growing up by threatening to cut off his financial support that I thought my mom relied on. Turns out there was no formal child support agreement and his financial \u201chelp\u201d was just $200-$400 every 4 or 5 months when I would visit him (he always made a bug show of entrusting me with the check since I was in pre school). He kept me from getting a job and doing a lot of other things that would have helped me improve my start to life by threatening to remove nonexistent aid, which in turn kept me dependent on his fickle handouts further into adulthood than I would have liked. \n\nIt also generally caused my a lot of distress jumping through hoops to keep him in a good mood because I was afraid of my mother hurting financially if I didn\u2019t. Only for it to turn out that they were both lying about his contributions, and that my mom did it to \u201cprotect me\u201d when knowing the truth would have made my life so much better. \n\nNow I am just mad at both of them over how much I let my life get fucked up over what turned out to be $50 a month and two misguided idiots\u2019 idea of what it meant to be a \u201cgood parent.\u201d", ">She knows.\n\nYou have absolutely no idea if this is true or not. Husband has already proven himself to be a liar throughout his life, what's to say he ever even told his wife that he had a kid in the past? IF she knows, I agree that she's a monster.", ">\tthe \u201cBtw I\u2019m against abortion so if I get pregnant, I\u2019m keeping it,\u201d kinda does read as baby trapping,\n\nWhat? That's literally the opposite of baby trapping. Baby trapping inherently requires the trapper to mislead the trappee into conceiving a child, that's the whole reason it's called a trap.", "If the Dad only ever paid the legally required amount of money for child support, and never paid any kind of NON-monetary attention to the child - no non-custodial parent visits, no meeting the child, no cards or phone calls, zip, zero, zilch - then OP KNOWS he has never paid any kind of attention beyond the monetary, and the monetary beyond child support (like a college fund he's been working on all her life, for example) is the only way he CAN prove he gave a shit about the child before he asked about her at age 16.", "> When did he demand an abortion?\n\nWhen did I say he demanded an abortion?  It's fucked up to have sex with a clear, premeditated intention of abandoning any children born from the union.  Do your due diligence, only have sex with women who say they'd want an abortion.  Sure, people change their minds, but at least then you know you did everything you were supposed to do prior.\n\n>Then, when she had to drop out of college and got side eye from family and friends, she wanted to blame him?\n\nHe's been running around telling everyone she baby trapped him, of course she's pissed off at him. \n\n>What did he do here that was deceitful or tricky?\n\nWhere did I say he was deceitful or tricky? \n\n>But she can't blame him for the struggles she went through as a single mother.\n\nWhere did she say she blames him for her struggles?  She's upset at his audacity to try to come back after she already did all the hard work of child-rearing, not that she had to do the hard work in the first place.", "Has OP's ex made any amends? Has he reached out to the friends and family members he slandered OP to and set the record straight? Has he done anything to make amends to his daughter for being completely absent for 16 years? (No, \"I'm ready now that you've done the bulk of the work and she's going to be a legal adult soon\" isn't showing him making amends.)", "\"People can change..\"\n\n\n*maaaaaan* someone sold you a lie and you bought it.", "I feel like if his desire to get to know his actually appeared to be coming from a genuine place rather than trying to fill a spot in his would-be family since his wife wants to be a mom so bad, OP may have been more receptive. \n\nMy son's stepmom struggled with infertility. His dad has been involved his whole life though, but she had always treated me like a second character. They were the family unit and I was some annoying other person that her son spent most of his time with. Then she finally was able to have her own kids. Now my son is annoying to her and he constantly complains about her being rude to him (he's 11 now). \n\nI agree with OP's assessment of the situation. This generally isn't a good thing to put a 16-year-old into and, as a mom, I think I would want my daughter to know the timing, too, so she could manager her expectations if she decided to meet with him.", "His change was his current wife not being able to give him kids. he didn\u2019t have a sudden change in heart. he didn\u2019t apologize for abandoning op and her child. he didn\u2019t even have any proof he thought of her or this child until this moment he reached out to her", "As a kid who had both parents complaining to me about the other, I don\u2019t think people say that because they think you should lie to your kid per say. More so they are a child and they don\u2019t need to know certain things nor should it be their responsibility to hold an adult\u2019s frustrations with another adult.\n\nIf the adults are able to present facts without their emotions interfering and to frame in in a way that focuses on the emotions and welfare of the child who will also be feeling a lot of things about having a crappy parent, then sure. Or if the child is old enough to hold some of their parents more personal thoughts on the subject like OPs 16 year old, absolutely. But to dump your own feelings about another adult on a kid is not appropriate and is what many people do. \n\nBut \u201cYour dad did some really crappy things to me when I was pregnant with you that make me really skeptical of him. I\u2019m also very concerned that his wife seems to be having infertility issues according to her posts and now he\u2019s reaching out. That does feel right to me and the timing feels off to me. What do you think about this? Would you like to know more about anything before making a choice?\u201d Is a very different conversation with a 16 year old than \u201cYou dad is a shitty person and I don\u2019t think he cared about you at all. He\u2019s just here now because he can\u2019t have other kids. Do you want to me him?\u201d Both are true but one is more about the kid and the other about the parent. I don\u2019t know what tone OP had but I\u2019m hoping for the first as she seems pretty aware.", "Totally agree that this guy sounds super scummy. And that there are some major red flags here and OP needs to tread carefully.  My sperm donor is a selfish bastard. BUT my mom did me the biggest favor she could by supporting me getting to know him and other relatives on that side and not letting her opinion color mine. Because she let me get to know them and form my own opinions I have zero regrets in being no contact with My dad but I have an awesome uncle and my grandma is a sweetheart.", "Exactly.  If he really wants to demonstrate serious interest in his daughter he can start a college fund for her and front load it heavily.  That would show some investment on his part in the child's future.\n\nOtherwise blah blah blah - I can't hear his words over the deafening indifference of his actions.", "Nope. Gotta disagree with you. The truth is best. I was in a VERY similar situation, except my mother didn't TELL me the truth. She tried to keep him in my life and painted him as a good person. All he did was hurt me. OP is right to protect her baby.  \nSometimes NOT knowing a parent is a blessing.", "I've got a fourteen year-old and even I sometimes think I'd rather not have him visit. LoL.", "I am not suggesting that she should not tell her the truth, but that she should be careful about how she states the truth.  OP needs to try to focus on her daughter and her daughter's needs, not the hurt that OP has felt for the past 16 years.  The resentment that OP feels is pretty evident in her story here.  There are ways to tell the truth that show the resentment that OP feels and ways to tell the truth that remain neutral.  I am just suggesting that she try to remain neutral.", "Hope the acquaintance had the bare minimum decency of apologize cause what a rude and unnecessary thing to do...", ">  I think OP may have gone too far in telling her the truth about him\n\nBut to omit the truth is literally the same as to not TELL her the truth. This man turned people against OP and wanted nothing to do with the daughter until his wife couldn't conceive. OP is right to keep him away. This isn't about resentment at all. This is a matter of knowing your kid is about to be used and is only wanted for emotional reasons for someone else. Forget the fact that this was a dead beat dad who only wants involvement when it benefits him and his new family.", "This was my thought as well.", "Or a donor kidney. He might need one now \ud83d\ude12", ">Prior to doing the deed, I told him if anything were to happen I would not be getting an abortion. He said he understood.\n\nI swear men will say anything if it means they get their dicks wet.  No thought for consequences, they don't care if they lie, don't care if someone else (aka a woman) suffers, christ.  \n\nNTA.  He sure is, though.", "Daughter of a \u2018dad\u2019 who didn\u2019t want me in his life until his new wife couldn\u2019t have kids here; your daughter is better off. When my bio-dad divorced wife number 2, and wife number 3 could have kids, I was out of his life again. NTA.", "I'm going to get downvoted for this but I'm going with ESH. \n\nYeah, he sucks. Your daughter knows that, and it's good that you were honest with her TO A POINT. I also want to make sure to say that your pain and anger are 1000% justified and valid, and I hope you can see a therapist or something to talk through it. Also, gently, I feel the resentment seething through your words, and while he made his choice to only provide financial assistance, you also made the choice to be a single mom. You both knew the deal when you had sex. That might be another thing that needs to be processed with a professional.\n\nBut you should not have dumped your adult trauma and your past hurt feelings on your daughter about something so significant to her. Your problems are not supposed to be her problems, and you don't know that the fertility issue is why he's reaching out. Maybe their struggle made him realize how much he DOES want to be a real dad and begin a relationship with his daughter. What would be wrong about that motivation? You have no basis for telling her that he is just seeking a replacement child, and what a hurtful thing to burden your kid with when you have no proof, you just made up that story from stalking his wife's social media. \n\nAdults need to stop burdening their kids with their issues if they can avoid it, and I feel like single parents are especially prone to doing this. I know my mom did, and it caused its own trauma.", "NTA.\n\nWow, he waited 16 years. That's cold. \n\nYour daughter is old enough to know everything. She was probably already somewhat reconciled to the idea that she would never know him, and she should know what kind of person he is. And now she does.\n\nI'd ask for more than a college fund. Where is the 16 years of child support? Where is the admission to his family and friends that he smeared your reputation out of his own shame?\n\nA bare minimum for forgiveness is to admit one's trespasses, and make a legitimate effort to correct the harm caused. When he did correct the harm? Does he even acknowledge the harm? If not, then no forgiveness.", "The idea that moms who actually raised and cared about their kids are supposed to lie and protect the undeserved image of deadbeat dads is so damn ridiculous and disgusting. \n\nShe told the truth. If that \u201cpoisoned\u201d her daughter\u2019s view of him that\u2019s on HIM.", "God isn\u2019t this the truth. He\u2019s missed so many firsts. Didn\u2019t kiss a single boo boo or wake up at 3am for a dose of medicine or held her when someone broke her heart. NTA at all. He donated sperm. OP was the actual parent.", "I personally don't think he's trying to be \"fun dad.\" I think deep down he wanted kids but didn't want them while he was still in party mode. He seems to be the type to want to have sex without protection and then get shocked when his actions have consequences because i am imagining that no way was OP telling him if she gets pregnant, shes not getting an abortion without there being some underlining reason as to why she even had to say that in the first place. So when OP got pregnant, he panicked because he wasn't expecting his actions had consequences and he scapegoat his way out of it by saying OP trapped him. Just so he could get of scott free and continue his party life before he settled. \n\n16 years has passed and not once was he interested in his daughter that is when his wife is coincidently having trouble conceiving. Now he wants to know his daughter? He thought his wife was going to give him kids and he could forget about his daughter. His life plan was to continue to party, then settle down and marry, then have kids with his wife and OP's daughter was not a part of this vision. His wife having trouble conceiving disrupted his vision and now he's scrambling to get his supposed \"one chance\" at being a father and he feels OP is purposefully blocking him by her telling her daughter the truth that his love is conditional. Meaning daughter has to think about what if his wife do conceive successfully? How is he going to move forward in a relationship with her after the fact? That he already abandoned her once means he could do it again. And daughter recognized that and noted out of wanting to know him\n\nIn addition, I can't imagine a woman who is having infertility troubles is going to be open towards a teen daughter around her. She will know he had sex with another woman before her and even had a child with her but they're married and she's having trouble giving him a child. I'm sure he's fed her lies about his relationship with OP and the daughter and having the daughter around while she's going through emotional distress is probably going to make her resentful. She'll be resentful of the daughter being a real human being and proof that her husband is fertile enough to have kids while she's struggling and she'll be resentful of the thought that her whole worth seemed to be narrowed down to her ability to conceive because why is her husband bringing his teenage daughter around all of a sudden when he had no interest in her before?", "Lets be real we all know the consequences of sex and she was upfront about keeping the child if it came down to that so he knew what he was doing therefore she has all the right to feel resentful towards him. He made her look awful to other people by saying she baby trapped him therefor had NO familial support, no support from friends and no support from him except the most minimal child support. After 16 years he thinks about her now because he has a \u201cperfect life\u201d all but a kid. But wait OP had a kid and now that shes grown he wants to come back like nothing happened? Why? Because the hard part is done. The child you speak of is 16, almost an adult and im sure she knows as well her father had options and his was to walk out on her and her mom knowing he would miss out on her and never looked back until now. So yeah she made her choice freely.", "And he CHOSE to have sex with her", "It's crazy how rare this sentiment is in here. Everyone's praising OP for dumping on the deadbeat when he's (imo) trying to do the right thing. I totally agree with you that she handled the situation abysmally.", "What are you on? She worked for the kid she's treating her well. There's no father requirement she needs? Like wtf. It's not some horrid situation to grow up without a father what is wrong with you.", "People can absolutely change. But those who have a bad past have to show and demonstrate they are trustworthy and have changed. This sperm donor has not done so. OP was absolutely NTA in warning her about this man", "She gave a young adult the ability to choose knowing all the facts. NTA", "OP has saved her daughter the pain of finding out for herself.\n\nWhy go down that road if you know exactly what your going to find - and its not pleasant. At least OP has given the daughter a map of the territory.", "It\u2019s not enough to say \u201csorry\u201d and just come back. You need to make things right. That takes time, probably money too. And counselling for the kid to understand why some interloper is now expecting to be called Dad. \n\nOOP shouldn\u2019t block contact if daughter wants it but she\u2019s entirely right to tell daughter what she knows about him. \n\nThis guy doesn\u2019t want OOP\u2019s daughter. He wants to complete his life card set. If his wife had babies OOP wouldn\u2019t have heard anything from him.", "OP had to drop out of college and change her whole life trajectory to raise that kid. That\u2019s fine; it was her choice. BUT, if it were me and  he wanted in now after I gave everything for our kid, he better be willing to put up. He shouldn\u2019t get all of the benefits with none of the costs.", "I agree, the truth is always the best, no matter how harsh or ugly. I wish someone told me when I was younger. When I was younger, I hero worshipped one parent and resented the other. As I grew older, I found out the truth. I regret ever thinking that one parent was the hero and regret not empathizing with the parent I resented.", "Wife will either be salty she exists, or try too hard to adopt her as her own. Those are my bets", "Funny how he choose to still go in knowing where she stood but somehow she \u201cTRAPED\u201d him.

Then, calling her being infertile a \u201cred flag\u201d. \n\nHe\u2019s an ah for obvious reasons. I feel bad for your daughter. This comes across as you being angry (which is understandable) and venting on your daughter.", "She \"stalked\" him because she looked them up on FB? Stalking would be following him around online during the years prior, which she didn't. She was looking out for her daughter. That's not stalking and you're way out of line trying to paint it as such.", "You say OP is no saint, but what the hell did they do wrong? They literally just told the truth \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640", "Parental alienation could be a factor, but at her age, a court is going to give her the benefit of the doubt of being able to think for herself, and I don\u2019t see it as alienation as much as giving the facts. If the mother lied, that\u2019s different, but if it\u2019s simply facts that made the daughter not want to see the father, that\u2019s his fault. You can\u2019t argue \u201cshe told my daughter the truth, which makes me look bad, and now she doesn\u2019t want to see me,\u201d and expect a court to favor you.", "Or they resent you for lying to them when they grow up & find out the truth & 3nd up hating both parents in the end"]}
