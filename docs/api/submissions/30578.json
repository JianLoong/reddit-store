I know that this isn't standard for Finland, but somebody asked if we are all okay going together and nobody objected, so we all went together. It was fun and we went once more before I left.\n\nWhen I got back I told this to my boyfriend of 1 year.

I\u2019m from Germany and like you, I wouldn\u2019t have even thought about discussing this topic with my partner. Why would I? Saunas are not a sexual place, naked bodies are not per se sexual, it\u2019s normal - at least in our culture. But on a theoretical level I understand that your bf feels different. For his cultural background this is a sexual act and he is well within his rights to be weirded out by you \u201cstripping\u201d (in his mind) in front of strangers. \n\nI see some people here wondering why OP wouldn\u2019t think about discussing this. It\u2019s hard to explain so I\u2019ll try an analogy: if you come from a culture where bikinis are a common swimwear, would you discuss with your partner if going to the pool in a bikini is okay for them? Probably not, you would expect this to be normal and therefore your partner should bring it up if they have requests outside the norm. And this is what happened here: OP didn\u2019t discuss because naked common saunas are normal and it goes without saying; her bf didn\u2019t discuss because the opposite is normal and expected for him. \n\nOP, both of you should give it a bit of time and then you should discuss the cultural differences. This is just one of them, more might come up in the future, some serious, some fun. This is just what happens in intercultural relationships, everyone assumes their own reality as normal. I hope you both can find understanding for each other", "NTA\n\nAs a finnish person no clothes in the sauna is a very common rule, and if everyone was comfortable with the mixed gender group, I don't see anything wrong with it. I don't really understand your boyfriends POV. Would he have been okay with it if you had told him beforehand?", "NTA! People who think of a sauna as a sexual place, as your boyfriend apparently is, need to check themselves.", "You're comfortable with it.\n\nHe's not.\n\nThats not \"crossing a boundary\" though since boundaries are about one's own behavior.\n\nNAH", "i mean finnland and sauna are the same word basically. you cant go there without visiting a sauna. \n\nNAH on the mixed part. thats just cultural. like the ones who have a problem with nude beaches and those who dont", "NAH. It\u2019s fine for you to see nudity in that context as not sexual. It\u2019s also fine for him to not like other men seeing his partner naked.", "NTA.\n\nBoundaries shift with social norms, by which I mean:\n\nIf you were in your/his home country and saunas are typically sorted by sex, then it'd be sexual harassment to enter the 'wrong' sauna. However, being as this was a country where it's normal for unisex saunas to exist with no sexual undertones (you weren't in a swingers club lmao) surely the boundary shifts from you being sexually harassed to you simply being joined by people of the opposite gender?\n\nRegardless, the fact of the matter is that you were joined by multiple people from work who were obviously going to kick you out if there were any shenannigans going on in the sauna. The thing that I don't understand is why would he be fine with you getting into saunas with other women? Surely that'd also be something that makes him uncomfortable considering that lesbians exist too?\n\nI don't know, all I can tell you is that he doesn't see it as cheating, he's definitely just upset at the prospect of you having seen somebody else's penis. It's purely a matter of insecurity.", "NAH..\n\nMost Europeans are not so prude and don't see the big issued with nudity. (I'm assuming you could easily hold yourself back from any Sexual activity lol). \n\nThat being said, some are not so open with nudity. Y'all should've discussed it a bit better...", "NTA\n\n>He got quite flustered and told me that I should have discussed it with him. He wouldn't have \"forbidden\" me from going there, but he would not be comfortable. \n\nThe fact that he realizes he shouldn't forbid you (it's your decision - not his) shows that on some level, he understands he is in the wrong.\n\nI do get where he's coming from, however. It's ok for him to be uncomfortable with it. I suspect if you grew up in his country, you would have spoken to him first. But because you are from a country where this is quite normal, it did not cross your mind. You both have to accept that from time to time, you will be surprised by an unexpected cultural difference that pops up between you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He feels like I crossed a boundary and what I did was adjacent to cheating.\n\nThis is a huge overreaction on his part. One thing to consider -- when you cheat on someone, you generally hide it from them. The fact that it did not cross your mind not to tell him about the sauna very clearly illustrates that to you it was nothing of the sort.\n\nHave you ever gone to a mixed-company sauna with him? Maybe you should. It might help him understand a bit better. Whatever you do, don't dismiss his feelings -- even if you don't share them, it's always good to try to understand them.", "I'm estonian so like I'm a bit biased:\n\nBut nta. It's extremely normal in alot of these cultures for this. it's just part of life. Nudity is seen as so taboo in so much of the world and I just personally don't get it. Like it's not like you were sleeping with these other people, you just took a saun. Which is extremely common.", "NAH\n\nIt should not be hard to understand why someone might consider their partner being in mixed company without clothes to be out of bounds. Especially in a \"she went off to another country for two weeks and did this while she was away\" scenario.\n\nAt the same time, you're not an AH for doing something that's normal in your culture, and that fact making it not occur to you that it might be different for your boyfriend.\n\nNobody's acting maliciously. He needs to be a little more understanding that this is a normal thing where you come from, and you need to be conscious of the fact that this crosses a (very reasonable) boundary for him, and acknowledge that to him and agree to not do that in the future.", "NTA. Obviously you didn't discuss it with him because you could not have imagined that it was an issue.", "American here, and the idea of these mixed saunas is weird to me. Personally, I wouldn't be comfortable with my girlfriend going to a mixed sauna with randoms, let alone people she works with on the daily. Id be pretty miffed to find out she went to one without even talking to me. \n\nIf it's part of her culture, and it's something she has no problem with, I guess that just means we aren't compatible and we need to break up. Maybe you two just aren't compatible. \n\nI don't really know how to judge this one, so my best guess is NAH.", "NAH. Communicate about it, come to a resolution for how to deal with this situation in the future that you're both comfortable with, or just break up. You can't be an asshole for not knowing and he's not an asshole for being flustered about it.", "I personally do not think it is appropriate to go to a non-segregated, nude sauna while in a relationship and also with colleagues (kind of unprofessional in my opinion).\n\nI am originally from a more conservative European country where there isnt a \"sauna culture\" but have lived in countries where there is (currently also living in the nordics). My bf attends a male sauna near by with a choice of clothed/unclothed.\n\nAgain, just my opinion.", "INFO \n\nIs he upset because is was a mixed sauna or because it was with your colleagues?", "NAH\n\nI dont think you are wrong for going to a mixed no clothes sauna. However, your boyfriend obviously has a problem with it and it seems like this is something you haven't talked about before. Honest mistake from your side to not check with him, but now you know you should discuss how to handle this next time. I also think he should understand where you are coming from and not make a big deal of it", "NAH. You knew he was accustomed to gender-segregated saunas, so you should have guessed he could be uncomfortable with you being nude in mixed company.  Now you know, so do what you like with the information for future trips.\n\nPersonally, the \"general nudity\" isn't the unusual thing to me.  I wouldn't want to be nude around *my colleagues* at all.", "So, your bf wouldn't have \"forbidden\" it? How accepting. That he even threw that word out there, as if it were an option for him, is telling. Disturbing, too. And, that you going to a gender accepting sauna was cheating adjacent? Huh. As if another person's genitalia would hypnotize you into forgetting who you are. It sounds like he doesn't know you very well or doesn't trust you. Whatever it is, I think a good conversation is in the offing. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. Going to a sauna where everyone is naked is by no means \"adjacent to cheating\".", "NTA\nSome people really need to get over their hangups on a bit of nudity.", "NTA\n\nWhen in Rome...", "YTA why are you getting naked in front of dudes without saying anything to your boyfriend", "Which European country?\n\nNtA. But now he knows: when you go to a sauna there's a chance of there being both men and women there.", "I would say the vast majority of men alive (redditors are not even closely representative of the average man or woman) would have the same opinion as your bf, myself included. I\u2019d be freaked out. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re an AH. If you want, you can say you\u2019re sorry a few times to calm things down but please don\u2019t feel that bad or feel like you have to grovel. If he doesn\u2019t let it go after awhile he\u2019s an AH. That said, you have a new boundary: no getting naked with other men. If you can\u2019t accept that, you should break it off with him. Neither the boundary is unreasonable nor would you be if you decide you can\u2019t accept it. You\u2019re only an AH if you stay and keep doing it.", "nah. sauna is sauna. (german here btw) \nI don\u2019t know what the fuss is with naked bodies. You were not alone with someone and if there wasn\u2019t a frisky mood it was just spa day.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is being prudish. Don't let this rub off on you. If he is otherwise trying to be controlling, this is a red flag!", "NTA.

Maybe consider seeing someone who doesn\u2019t have weird hang ups around nudity.", "Your boyfriend was fine with the sauna visit until you later revealed that it was mixed gender, so presume the colleague who invited you was a man (why are you leaving out this detail?). Long distance trips like this have a bad reputation for being a perfect recipe for infidelity. Consider how your actions might look to a partner with that in context.\n\nNAH, you didn't cheat on your partner, but having a male colleague invite you to get naked with him basically as soon as you got to Finland obviously looks bad, so his distrust of the situation is valid.", "His need to know tiny details about your activities, just so that he can upset himself with them, is a troublesome indication of an excessive desire on his part to control you and everything you do regardless of where you are.\n\nIt is a warning sign, he has deep-seated insecurities that he'll project harmfully.", "NTA \n\nThat is by no means \"cheating adjacent\". Your bf is completely off-base, and you have nothing to be sorry for.", "NTA!  I'm Swedish  with dash Finnish in me,  trust me  saunas are NOT about the naughty here, it about getting clean and  hanging with people.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, your boyfriend  how ever, yikes..  no, he  mind is doing tricks you shouldn't do  in saunas.", "NTA Your boyfriend is being insecure and making it your problem. You didn't do anything wrong and he needs to grow up.", "A gentle YTA. You should've discussed it beforehand to minimize any cultural concerns. \n\nIt's understandable that your boyfriend might have felt uncomfortable and even betrayed by your actions, especially if he perceived the sauna visit as crossing a boundary in your relationship. What's normal in your culture may not be normal in his. But it's also a minor mistake that you didn't discuss it beforehand. Not anything to end the world over. \n\nMoving forward, I'd say have more open conversations about cultural differences, as well as values and comfort levels. It's all about feeling comfortable and secure within your relationship.", "NTA. Nudity does not equal sex. I'm from a place where to many people it does (I live in the American Midwest). But I feel like many cultures in Europe (especially Norden countries, it seems) are much more chill about nudity, even in mixed company. I understand that he was surprised about it, but I feel like it's pretty well known that nudity is the absolutely expected norm in those situations, and he needs to get over it.", "NTA.\n\nYour bf does not control you and should not try to.

There is nothing sexual about going to a sauna.\n\nNTA\n\nIf you had known that he would have liked a heads up, sure, it would be nice to have told him, but you didn't expect it to be a problem. I don't think it is fair of him to blame you for not having the same cultural assumptions.\n\nHow this should've rolled out is:\n\n1. He is surprised\n2. You clarify the different cultural norms\n3. He gets over it\n4. You all laugh over the misunderstanding", "NTA- you did a culturally normal thing, I wouldn\u2019t think to let a partner know I was going to a group sauna. I mean no one I date would re anyway, because it is nothing close to cheating. That is beyond crazy. It\u2019s not like you took an baked sauna alone with one dude or anything. I\u2019m from the US, and a lot of people here are prudes who think nudity= sex. It\u2019s a very unhealthy attitude", "Yta I wouldn't appreciate if my fiance got naked in front of other men.
