I\u2019m from Germany and like you, I wouldn\u2019t have even thought about discussing this topic with my partner. Why would I? Saunas are not a sexual place, naked bodies are not per se sexual, it\u2019s normal - at least in our culture. But on a theoretical level I understand that your bf feels different. For his cultural background this is a sexual act and he is well within his rights to be weirded out by you \u201cstripping\u201d (in his mind) in front of strangers. \n\nI see some people here wondering why OP wouldn\u2019t think about discussing this. It\u2019s hard to explain so I\u2019ll try an analogy: if you come from a culture where bikinis are a common swimwear, would you discuss with your partner if going to the pool in a bikini is okay for them? Probably not, you would expect this to be normal and therefore your partner should bring it up if they have requests outside the norm. And this is what happened here: OP didn\u2019t discuss because naked common saunas are normal and it goes without saying; her bf didn\u2019t discuss because the opposite is normal and expected for him. \n\nOP, both of you should give it a bit of time and then you should discuss the cultural differences. This is just one of them, more might come up in the future, some serious, some fun. This is just what happens in intercultural relationships, everyone assumes their own reality as normal. I hope you both can find understanding for each other", "NTA\n\nAs a finnish person no clothes in the sauna is a very common rule, and if everyone was comfortable with the mixed gender group, I don't see anything wrong with it. I don't really understand your boyfriends POV. Would he have been okay with it if you had told him beforehand?", "NTA! People who think of a sauna as a sexual place, as your boyfriend apparently is, need to check themselves.", "You're comfortable with it.\n\nHe's not.\n\nThats not \"crossing a boundary\" though since boundaries are about one's own behavior.\n\nNAH", "i mean finnland and sauna are the same word basically. you cant go there without visiting a sauna. \n\nNAH on the mixed part. thats just cultural. like the ones who have a problem with nude beaches and those who dont", "NAH. It\u2019s fine for you to see nudity in that context as not sexual. It\u2019s also fine for him to not like other men seeing his partner naked.", "NTA.\n\nBoundaries shift with social norms, by which I mean:\n\nIf you were in your/his home country and saunas are typically sorted by sex, then it'd be sexual harassment to enter the 'wrong' sauna. However, being as this was a country where it's normal for unisex saunas to exist with no sexual undertones (you weren't in a swingers club lmao) surely the boundary shifts from you being sexually harassed to you simply being joined by people of the opposite gender?\n\nRegardless, the fact of the matter is that you were joined by multiple people from work who were obviously going to kick you out if there were any shenannigans going on in the sauna. The thing that I don't understand is why would he be fine with you getting into saunas with other women? Surely that'd also be something that makes him uncomfortable considering that lesbians exist too?\n\nI don't know, all I can tell you is that he doesn't see it as cheating, he's definitely just upset at the prospect of you having seen somebody else's penis. It's purely a matter of insecurity.", "NAH..\n\nMost Europeans are not so prude and don't see the big issued with nudity. (I'm assuming you could easily hold yourself back from any Sexual activity lol). \n\nThat being said, some are not so open with nudity. Y'all should've discussed it a bit better...", "NTA\n\n>He got quite flustered and told me that I should have discussed it with him. He wouldn't have \"forbidden\" me from going there, but he would not be comfortable. \n\nThe fact that he realizes he shouldn't forbid you (it's your decision - not his) shows that on some level, he understands he is in the wrong.\n\nI do get where he's coming from, however. It's ok for him to be uncomfortable with it. I suspect if you grew up in his country, you would have spoken to him first. But because you are from a country where this is quite normal, it did not cross your mind. You both have to accept that from time to time, you will be surprised by an unexpected cultural difference that pops up between you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He feels like I crossed a boundary and what I did was adjacent to cheating.\n\nThis is a huge overreaction on his part. One thing to consider -- when you cheat on someone, you generally hide it from them. The fact that it did not cross your mind not to tell him about the sauna very clearly illustrates that to you it was nothing of the sort.\n\nHave you ever gone to a mixed-company sauna with him? Maybe you should. It might help him understand a bit better. Whatever you do, don't dismiss his feelings -- even if you don't share them, it's always good to try to understand them.", "I'm estonian so like I'm a bit biased:\n\nBut nta. It's extremely normal in alot of these cultures for this. it's just part of life. Nudity is seen as so taboo in so much of the world and I just personally don't get it. Like it's not like you were sleeping with these other people, you just took a saun. Which is extremely common.", "NAH\n\nIt should not be hard to understand why someone might consider their partner being in mixed company without clothes to be out of bounds. Especially in a \"she went off to another country for two weeks and did this while she was away\" scenario.\n\nAt the same time, you're not an AH for doing something that's normal in your culture, and that fact making it not occur to you that it might be different for your boyfriend.\n\nNobody's acting maliciously. He needs to be a little more understanding that this is a normal thing where you come from, and you need to be conscious of the fact that this crosses a (very reasonable) boundary for him, and acknowledge that to him and agree to not do that in the future.", "NTA. Obviously you didn't discuss it with him because you could not have imagined that it was an issue.", "American here, and the idea of these mixed saunas is weird to me. Personally, I wouldn't be comfortable with my girlfriend going to a mixed sauna with randoms, let alone people she works with on the daily. Id be pretty miffed to find out she went to one without even talking to me. \n\nIf it's part of her culture, and it's something she has no problem with, I guess that just means we aren't compatible and we need to break up. Maybe you two just aren't compatible. \n\nI don't really know how to judge this one, so my best guess is NAH.", "NAH. Communicate about it, come to a resolution for how to deal with this situation in the future that you're both comfortable with, or just break up. You can't be an asshole for not knowing and he's not an asshole for being flustered about it.", "I personally do not think it is appropriate to go to a non-segregated, nude sauna while in a relationship and also with colleagues (kind of unprofessional in my opinion).\n\nI am originally from a more conservative European country where there isnt a \"sauna culture\" but have lived in countries where there is (currently also living in the nordics). My bf attends a male sauna near by with a choice of clothed/unclothed.\n\nAgain, just my opinion.", "INFO \n\nIs he upset because is was a mixed sauna or because it was with your colleagues?", "NAH\n\nI dont think you are wrong for going to a mixed no clothes sauna. However, your boyfriend obviously has a problem with it and it seems like this is something you haven't talked about before. Honest mistake from your side to not check with him, but now you know you should discuss how to handle this next time. I also think he should understand where you are coming from and not make a big deal of it", "NAH. You knew he was accustomed to gender-segregated saunas, so you should have guessed he could be uncomfortable with you being nude in mixed company.  Now you know, so do what you like with the information for future trips.\n\nPersonally, the \"general nudity\" isn't the unusual thing to me.  I wouldn't want to be nude around *my colleagues* at all.", "So, your bf wouldn't have \"forbidden\" it? How accepting. That he even threw that word out there, as if it were an option for him, is telling. Disturbing, too. And, that you going to a gender accepting sauna was cheating adjacent? Huh. As if another person's genitalia would hypnotize you into forgetting who you are. It sounds like he doesn't know you very well or doesn't trust you. Whatever it is, I think a good conversation is in the offing. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. Going to a sauna where everyone is naked is by no means \"adjacent to cheating\".", "NTA\nSome people really need to get over their hangups on a bit of nudity.", "NTA\n\nWhen in Rome...", "YTA why are you getting naked in front of dudes without saying anything to your boyfriend", "Which European country?\n\nNtA. But now he knows: when you go to a sauna there's a chance of there being both men and women there.", "I would say the vast majority of men alive (redditors are not even closely representative of the average man or woman) would have the same opinion as your bf, myself included. I\u2019d be freaked out. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re an AH. If you want, you can say you\u2019re sorry a few times to calm things down but please don\u2019t feel that bad or feel like you have to grovel. If he doesn\u2019t let it go after awhile he\u2019s an AH. That said, you have a new boundary: no getting naked with other men. If you can\u2019t accept that, you should break it off with him. Neither the boundary is unreasonable nor would you be if you decide you can\u2019t accept it. You\u2019re only an AH if you stay and keep doing it.", "nah. sauna is sauna. (german here btw) \nI don\u2019t know what the fuss is with naked bodies. You were not alone with someone and if there wasn\u2019t a frisky mood it was just spa day.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is being prudish. Don't let this rub off on you. If he is otherwise trying to be controlling, this is a red flag!", "NTA.

Maybe consider seeing someone who doesn\u2019t have weird hang ups around nudity.", "Your boyfriend was fine with the sauna visit until you later revealed that it was mixed gender, so presume the colleague who invited you was a man (why are you leaving out this detail?). Long distance trips like this have a bad reputation for being a perfect recipe for infidelity. Consider how your actions might look to a partner with that in context.\n\nNAH, you didn't cheat on your partner, but having a male colleague invite you to get naked with him basically as soon as you got to Finland obviously looks bad, so his distrust of the situation is valid.", "His need to know tiny details about your activities, just so that he can upset himself with them, is a troublesome indication of an excessive desire on his part to control you and everything you do regardless of where you are.\n\nIt is a warning sign, he has deep-seated insecurities that he'll project harmfully.", "NTA \n\nThat is by no means \"cheating adjacent\". Your bf is completely off-base, and you have nothing to be sorry for.", "NTA!  I'm Swedish  with dash Finnish in me,  trust me  saunas are NOT about the naughty here, it about getting clean and  hanging with people.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, your boyfriend  how ever, yikes..  no, he  mind is doing tricks you shouldn't do  in saunas.", "NTA Your boyfriend is being insecure and making it your problem. You didn't do anything wrong and he needs to grow up.", "A gentle YTA. You should've discussed it beforehand to minimize any cultural concerns. \n\nIt's understandable that your boyfriend might have felt uncomfortable and even betrayed by your actions, especially if he perceived the sauna visit as crossing a boundary in your relationship. What's normal in your culture may not be normal in his. But it's also a minor mistake that you didn't discuss it beforehand. Not anything to end the world over. \n\nMoving forward, I'd say have more open conversations about cultural differences, as well as values and comfort levels. It's all about feeling comfortable and secure within your relationship.", "NTA. Nudity does not equal sex. I'm from a place where to many people it does (I live in the American Midwest). But I feel like many cultures in Europe (especially Norden countries, it seems) are much more chill about nudity, even in mixed company. I understand that he was surprised about it, but I feel like it's pretty well known that nudity is the absolutely expected norm in those situations, and he needs to get over it.", "NTA.\n\nYour bf does not control you and should not try to.

There is nothing sexual about going to a sauna.\n\nNTA\n\nIf you had known that he would have liked a heads up, sure, it would be nice to have told him, but you didn't expect it to be a problem. I don't think it is fair of him to blame you for not having the same cultural assumptions.\n\nHow this should've rolled out is:\n\n1. He is surprised\n2. You clarify the different cultural norms\n3. He gets over it\n4. You all laugh over the misunderstanding", "NTA- you did a culturally normal thing, I wouldn\u2019t think to let a partner know I was going to a group sauna. I mean no one I date would re anyway, because it is nothing close to cheating. That is beyond crazy. It\u2019s not like you took an baked sauna alone with one dude or anything. I\u2019m from the US, and a lot of people here are prudes who think nudity= sex. It\u2019s a very unhealthy attitude", "Yta I wouldn't appreciate if my fiance got naked in front of other men.

Interesting cultural lesson for a repressed englishman the other lesson I learnt was never match a Finn drink for drink especially when you have a key presentation to deliver at 8am.", "I'm from LATAM and recently moved to Spain, I go to the Sauna at the gym every time and it's always mixed to the point it never even once crossed my mind that they could be gender segregated...anywhere \ud83e\udd23\nI'll go with NTA.

But thats me being uptight about nudity in general, whilst knowing that it is in fact a me-problem.", "I would go to a mixed gender sauna with colleagues in Finland without hesitation. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t do it where I live in the United States because it would be weird here.", "Because it was a mixed sauna and we were nude", "Because it\u2019s a sauna and everyone else is? Nudity isn\u2019t inherently sexual lol.", "Germany, he's from north of Italy", "Exactly.", "Agreed.  Cultural or not getting in a room nude with the opposite sex while in a relationship is strange.  \n\nFor me personally getting in a hot room nude with people of any sex would be weird.  Dont even want to be in a locker room where people are open to walking around nude.  \n\nI dont want my stuff hanging out and dont want to see anyone elses.  \n\nFor people that are fine with this, thats perfectly ok.  Just not my thing, and I would feel uncomfortable about my spouse wanting to do this.  Moreso with coworkers than strangers but would be uncomfortable with it regardless.", "Right?  Americans are so prude. Hell half of Europe has 14 as the age of consent.  Stupid Americans.", "Why not? It's her body, it's just a sauna.", "More like \"I did something totally normal and my boyfriend is insecure about it\". NTA.", "> Also, Lived in Europe my entire life - very big advocate for Saunas.\n> \n> Not once in my entire life, has a sauna had a \"no clothes\" rule, \n\nGuess you've never been to a real sauna then! Clothes are not allowed at *most* saunas.... Only sporadically if you find one at a hotel, swimming pool or cheap spa. But the vast majority is mandatory naked. \n\nI'm also from Europe and enjoy going to the saunas... Always naked, sometimes mixed", ">Also, Lived in Europe my entire life - very big advocate for Saunas.  \n>  \n>Not once in my entire life, has a sauna had a \"no clothes\" rule, so not sure why you are lying to your boyfriend.\n\nYou must not have visited a sauna in Germany (which is where OP is from). I can confirm from personal experience that clothes are generally not allowed in the saunas here. (Obviously I can't speak for every sauna, but every one I've visited has been this way.)", "Yeah, I don't know where I stand on the Y T A / N T A but I know for a fact that saunas are not exclusively making people take their clothes off, at least not in my experience.", "My family takes hot tubs and saunas together and we are from the US.", "Yep, it's OK. In Finland, people go to saunas in family units, and it's totally fine.\n\nFriends enjoy time together going to sauna to relax.\n\nIf you are not comfortable with it, you wait your turn, and go alone.", "What an awful thing to say. Rape has nothing to do with this. Why would you say that?", "It's not like Finland and other European countries with similar views on nudity aren't Western too", "Here, in Danmark, I can quite often see people swimming in the sea, then taking the wet swimsuit off, towel themselves dry and than getting the dry clothes on.   \nNobody pays attention to it, however, my observation is, that mostly older people are doing it.", "As a Finnish woman, this is NOT a general norm in Finnish culture. I stopped going to sauna with my own dad when I was about 14 and I would NEVER go with my FIL, neither would he ever try to go with me.\n\nMixed sauna among friends is really not a general norm either, some do it, some don't. But it should be everyone's own choice, not their partners. Op is NTA.", "I can understand him wanting that to be a boundary and you can agree or disagree with it. But it's not cheating and that would be what I'm focusing on. That's a pretty big accusation and shows him to be insecure IMO.", "They bring in dirt from the outside. Finnish saunas are also made to be actually hot, so why would you wear clothes if you're going to be sweating buckets? Most people wear a towel if they want to cover up.", "In Japan, you bathe nude with (usually) the same sex, and you wash your body immediately before going in the water. Your hair shouldn't touch the water, nor should the tiny towel they give you (it's for wiping your face, soaking in cold water and putting on top of your head, etc). This is to keep the water clean. Probably a similar idea in other nude bathing cultures - clothes, even swim clothes, can carry dirt and chemicals into the water, so they're not allowed.", "Exactly, not everywhere has the same attitudes and that's unfortunately a fact that OP's boyfriend is going to have to live with.", "Second this. Confused as to how relationship status could be at all relevant here.", "I fully take it as a \u201cme thing\u201d too\u2026\n\nI just feel like, personally, when youre in a relationship, your partner should be the only person to see you naked.\n\nI mean, the men/women using the sauna are only human and will look, people will say that they wont but lets be honest and maybe there are weirdos who attend to oogle at other patrons. However, I am quite traditional in my relationship", "So he wouldn\u2019t like you to go to an mixed sauna at all?\n\nI could unterstand if he doesn\u2018t like you beeing nude with your coworkes around but what about strangers or Friends? I don\u2019t see the Problem there.", "Yeah.. different cultures have different approaches to nudity. I live in a neighboring European country and going to the beach and seeing people get naked is still different for me because I'm not used to it where I'm from. But my partner on the other hand doesn't even register it because nudity for him is normal.", "I thought so, lol.  Sorry.", "To be fair- it is extremely normal in a lot of European cultures, which is why she is NAH. They\u2019re taught this from a young age, as strange as it may seem to (normal) people from other cultures. But other than that, I extremely agree with you and do not want any part of that.", "It is not normal to be naked with male colleagues without discussing with your partner.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "I'm sorry are towels not allowed? Even nude ones generally require towels to sit on, otherwise just gross. And why would they stop someone wrapped in a towel?", "In my experience, you can always wrap in a towel if you feel shy, but you just don't go to a sauna in swimwear or anything like that", "Where I am from you are not allowed to wear swimwear or other clothes. Of course you take a towel which you could wrap around yourself, but most people are just naked", "[removed]", "Yeah I\u2019ve failed to hear of all these rapes that are happening at saunas", "That's weird, why not just swim nude then? (And this is a real question)", "Yeah, unfortunately young people tend to be more prudish.", "That makes sense. Initially I was interpreting it that it was against the rules to cover up. Thank you for the clarification.", "I wrote a reply above if you want to take a look, saves me writing it out again\u2026 plus im on my phone so its taking longer to type!", "Is the man not entitled to his own relationship standards though?", "It is there. That is the whole point.", "Nope, have to back up VeryMuchDutch102. In  most saunas clothes are not allowed. Those who allow clothes, or make them mandatory, are most often directly next to big swimmingpools and belong to those.", "I'm pretty sure towels don't fall under \"clothing\". Towels are actually mandatory, you shouldn't put your naked butt directly on the wood.", "Where I am from swimwear is not allowed in sauna's. Of course you can use a towel, but that's not clothing", "I just googled \"sauna regeln\" (sauna rules). \n\n[Here](https://www.saunapark-siebengebirge.de/saunaregeln-so-verhalten-sie-sich-in-der-sauna-richtig/) is the first result that google provided.\n\nThe second rule listed on the website is: \"Saunaregel 2: Immer nackt in der Sauna!\" (Sauna rule 2: Always naked in the sauna)\n\nHere is the text from google translate:\n\n>Sauna rule 2: Always naked in the sauna!  \nNaked or not naked? \u2013 This is probably the question of all questions about correct behavior in the sauna. But the sauna rule is clear: unless it is a special textile sauna where you sweat in swimwear, you sauna naked. You may feel a little embarrassed the first time, but you'll quickly get used to it. Because if everyone complies with sauna etiquette, being naked in the sauna is not an issue at all: nudity is the most natural thing in the world and in the sauna we are all the same (naked).  \nThere are very practical reasons why you should sweat unclothed in the sauna: textiles, especially synthetic materials, make sweating more difficult and sometimes release unpleasant odors or even harmful pollutants at high temperatures. This also applies to swimsuits and bikinis. Also take off your jewelry before using the sauna - because it can get dangerously hot - and leave your flip flops outside the sauna cabin.", "Oh yes, this is what I kinda mean as well. Sorry, I thought it was implied that you weren't allowed in with anything on.", "Some people aren't used to that though? So I'd still maybe have mentioned it. Stuff like that is very culturally dependant. Where I'm from, it's not one way or the either, it's personal preference.", "Most saunas explicitly forbid clothing, I've never been to one where it was allowed to wear clothes. You may wrap a towel around yourself but that's it.", "Jellyfish? I accidentally went to a nudist beach the other day and even they were putting on trunks to swim", "There is a difference between being naked for a long time and for two minutes while changing.", "Sure.  He\u2019s just not entitled to impose them on others. \n\nIf he\u2019s going to date someone from a different culture, he is going to have to find a way to be flexible about his assumptions. He can\u2019t expect a woman from another culture to adopt all his customs any more than he has to adopt all hers.", "Her boyfriend isn\u2019t from there and she knew it wasn\u2019t normal where he\u2019s feom", "Sure, but it could be an honest mistake that she didn't check with him. Could have happened to me, because I find it a very normal thing to do\n\nEdit: in my experience a sauna is a very non sexual environnement, so for me it would not cross my mind to check with my partner", "[removed]", "He was imposing how? Wanting to know is imposing?", "So she should change her cultural norms and those of the country because someone not from there might have an opinion? That makes sense.", "That is also true. I don't think anyone is really wrong - it's not sexual in my experience either but I'm a super shy person so tend to think along the vein of the boyfriend, but at the same time I have friends that probably feel how you and OP feel. Truly, I think it's an unfortunate example of each one thinking that the other must automatically think the way they do.", "no what? elaborate.", "This is true where I'm from. Clothes and swim wear are not allowed", "Telling her he wouldn\u2019t be okay with it is very close to telling her she should live by his culture. \n\nYou have to be pretty careful to be respectful of differences when you want to make things work.", "Her boyfriend yes. That\u2019s not just a random person", "OP just said he found it uncomfortable. Is he not entitled to his own feelings?", "Yes, her boyfriend that is not from there. Would you say the same if it was a normal nudist beach or she did some normal thing such as topless?", "He said he felt she had crossed a boundary and he \u201cwouldn\u2019t forbid her\u201d but felt it was adjacent to cheating. \n\nThere\u2019s work to do there.", "Yes lol", "Would he rather have kept it to himself?", "Are you rfom Afghanistan or something? What a prude lol"]}
