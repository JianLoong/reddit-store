It could be your room, or a house 20 miles away.

Thus, it would not be appropriate for her to use your garden in promotional materials as it was far more your work than hers. This is coupled with you not wishing to have photos of your home used in this way. Tell her you\u2019ll take action for harassment if she persists.", "NTA Like I've read so many times before,  NO is a complete sentence. It doesn't matter why you don't want pictures.

She is fine with it if it is not easy to identify her home from the photos (for example, she had a stone walkway put in and the mason put pictures of just the walkway on social media - the house wasn't identifiable).
