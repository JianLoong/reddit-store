No, having your partner around you is in no way similar to him bullying you and picking on you.  You\u2019ve finally found an effective way to shut down your bully.  It doesn\u2019t actually hurt him and he can choose to avoid you.  Kinda sounds like your sister liked watching you be hurt and is disappointed it no longer happens.", "LOL. Love you, NTA.\n\nYour sister is ignorant to an amazing degree and it\u2019s not remotely at all an accurate comparisons. Woof. She needs some DEI training.\n\nIf your existence as yourself makes him uncomfortable then awesome byproduct. This isn\u2019t an act, it\u2019s you as a person. Keep embracing who you are!", "NTA, you\u2019re literally just existing. This is his problem for being a close minded asshole.", "NTA. You are living your life as an out and proud gay man. He is being a bigot and avoiding you. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s intentional or not, because you have a right to exist fully as yourself.

Unless you are turning up on fetish gear and dry humping at Grandma's birthday what exactly is her problem? I'm guessing what's 'making him uncomfortable' is you being around your partner and normal level PDA.\n\nI mean, if you are into risk taking and jokes, when he starts on you just act like he's hitting on you - tell him he needs to sort out his own confused feelings with a non-family member and stop trying to get your attention like that because it's not healthy and you don't want to be flirted with...\n\nOf course you heavily roll the dice on his reaction, but from his previous ones, he probably won't want to be in the same zip code as you after that gets spread around the next family gathering.", "NTA: homophobes deserve to be uncomfortable. If they feel they don't have a place in polite society, they will either examine why and change (unlikely) or disassociate.\n\nBringing your SO to the gathering is your prerogative.

You just don\u2019t need some people in your life, even if they\u2019re family, to say the least. I don\u2019t get why your sister is so upset by this though.

Often folks are just never exposed to certain groups or types of people, and so as they develop they only have the negative ideas of what those groups are like. In my experience, fear ignorance and arrogance are the common traits i see in more blatant homophobes.\n\nAs funny as it would be for the twist to be that Paul was bi or something,  I really just think that he's never left his comfortable bubble, and is increasingly ignorant as a result.", "[removed]", "So what? OP honestly just wants to be left alone, and this is apparently the only way to achieve that. If Paul is uncomfortable with mild PDA or even the visible reminder that OP is gay in the form of his bf, that\u2019s entirely on Paul.

Being a short chubby dude and tryna stand up  too a 6ft asshole is tough optics wise honestly. My partner is a pretty tough punk dude and has been helping me a lot in terms of finding new techniques and affirmations to have more self confidence and stand my ground. But it's something I admittedly really want to work on, especially since I'm a b type in a family of a types.", "He has before for other reasons(usually while shitfaced) but I've admiteddly been dealing with this my whole life.  I know how to defend myself if it happens(part of why i wrestled back in HS along with self defense classes)", "I wasn't sure if it was okay to respond about this but since it seems like it is: I've known my sister for a while and honestly it's a bit of both.\n\nShe's said some pretty ignorant things in the past both about me being gay(\"i don't look the part\"), LGBT rights, and how my partner wouldn't be accepted by my family because he's \"too gay looking\"(he was actually kinda  a hit, my grandma loves him).\n\nAt the same time, I'm pretty confident this isn't about that. My sister has a really strong attachment to that side of the family,and due to previous spats that almost led to both sides going partially no contact, she's VERY defensive about them.  It's a big part of why she's  defended pauls actions for so long honestly. Honestly that's part of why i came here, I worry that by being active in  doing this i could accidentally escalate tensions.\n\nWhen we were younger, our parents weren't able to be very involved so we kinda had to find our own groups. I made a friend group and created a sort of found family. My sister found solace in our extended family, especially pauls side. So she's very attached to them and worried any change could cause another situation where our mother and pauls mother might try and shut down communications. Problem is: that puts us in a conflict of interest now that i'm forcing paul to change his behaviors.", "No? He stated he tested PDA and being near said Cousin, also? I'd ask you to apologize for the attempted character attack, but I doubt you'll even admit that was childish and pathetic.", "\"Yes, he is weaponizing his sexuality.\" At that moment, it is no longer about being left alone. And yes, it would be just as bad if a straight couple did so, BY your own metric, he's an AH, so why defend him. EVERYONE involved here acted poorly. Everyone should be better.", "Just work on that confidence my man. There's millions of guys who are either short or chubby or a combination of both who still have great self confidence. It's a mindset, so just keep working on it. Again, you're young so you got time to develop that.", "What EXACTLY did he do that was so egregious to you that would make him an AH here? Because all I see is him: 1. merely being around his bf, and 2. engaging in mild PDA. Yeah, he\u2019s leveraging that to keep Paul away, so it is weaponizing his sexuality, but that\u2019s not a bad thing. If you have info to the contrary, I\u2019m all ears, otherwise Paul is a garden variety homophobe, and him not being able to be around OP anymore is (blessedly) not OP\u2019s problem.", "I have already explained. At this point, I have to either try to simplify, \"HE ADMITTED HE DID IT SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SOMEONE UNCOMFORTABLE.\" I would say the same if it was a hetero couple, or ANYONE ELSE. Which should I remind you was your own metric, either accept my argument or don't, I explained myself in good faith, and you're either intentionally obtuse or just incapable of fair use of your own rules.", "No, my metric was \u201cnormal behavior that a straight couple would exhibit\u201d. I literally dgaf if he does it to make his abusive AH of a cousin uncomfortable and therefore stay away from him. If it is otherwise normal couple behavior, OP is in the clear 100%. Another reason why OP isn\u2019t TA here: he is only doing it to keep his cousin away. He isn\u2019t doing anything else. You need to get off your high horse.", "\"But unless he was doing something inappropriate for a straight couple.\" Your exact words, my response? His actions WOULD BE inappropriate if done by a straight couple. You have now stated you \"DGAF\" which means you're not going to take any argument in good faith. Do some self reflection and stop being so dishonest.", "Are you serious? None of this would be inappropriate behavior for a straight couple! The bf\u2019s mere presence is enough to keep Paul away, and unless the PDA is excessive/beyond what a straight couple could get away with, OP is not TA! And yeah, I said idgaf if he does what he needs to so his abusive cousin stays away from him as long as it\u2019s within reason. I have seen nothing from him or from you that tells me he has exceeded the normal rules of decency, so his cousin can stew in his own homophobic broth for all I care.", "No one is *ever* the asshole for making a homophobe uncomfortable.

So you're in the clear.", "YTA", "ESH YTA", "You're NTA, in fact your sisters an asshole here. This doesn't even begin to compare to the shit he's probably put you through, because you're just **existing** in his vicinity.

Is he some huge guy that your cousin might be afraid of?", "Your sister is part of the problem, not standing up for you in the past against Paul's bullshit.  Enjoy your quality time with the REST of your family.  \n\nNTA\n\nQuestion:  is your cousin Alexa the one who's also doing Paul's homework for him?  Or is that one of their other siblings?", "NTA, there is a BIG difference between both situation. Your cousin bullied and harassed you and made you feel miserable. You on the other hand are simply bringing your partner over to dinner which Paul just so happens to have issues with.\n\nYour sister is blind to this truth and you should absolutely keep doing it. Maybe buy some rainbow sunglasses or something to really rub it in.", "\"the power of the gay compels you- BEGONE!\" \n\nI would watch the hell out of that movie \n\nNTA.

Admiteddly it's had a reverse effect? My boyfs been encouraging me to be more proactive or take this farther but honestly I'm pretty comfortable with having Paul just leave me alone.", "Yeah that's the thing, he really isn't? Like he's really tall but they're both basically the same height? He does have a lot of piercings and a kinda punk look to him, but he's sorta a dork so he's not particularly scary( I think he's more disgusted then scared tbh.", "Nah that's also alexa. I didn't put this in due to character constraints but explaining my full family dynamic would lowkey require a chart.\n\nThe best way I can describe her is a neutral party. She cares really deeply for Paul and has lowkey ensured he got into both his expensive private school and college. She does his a lot of his homework, prepares study guides for him, and makes his college schedules for him each semester. She takes very legitmate pride in how much control she has in this regard and kinda brags about how well she's done at it during most family gatherings.\n\nAt the same time, she's very aware of how he's acted. While she isn't really willing to stop him, she's very much willing too call him out and at least acknowledge the behavior. In that sense, she's really the only member of the family on my mothers side i can be frank to about this. (My dads side consists of mostly reclusive suburban jews who don't \"give a crap about this werid irish people shit\".) She has a lotta weird libertarian takes she picked up on her adventures, but she's also the only younger relative on this side i'd consider a legitmate lgbt ally.\n\nNgl i also kinda suspect she revels in the drama a bit but that's neither here nor there.", "Neutral?  She sounds like a BIG enabler.  But that's fodder for another post, should you choose to discuss it.\n\nI hope you disregard what your sister says.  Congratulations on your relationship!", "Your sister is homophobic. The reason she empathizes with you terrible cousin is cause she understands why it would be uncomfortable.\n\nYou aren't escalating anything. You (hopefully) arent swapping tongues when you're around him, you're literally just *existing while gay*\n\nAnyone who has a problem with that is homophobic.", "your sister IS homophobic. A guy voting for a Nazi is a Nazi himself.", "Yes. It would be highly inappropriate, once again? Instead of just saying, \"I disagree with you.\" You're ignoring my point, any argument, totally ignoring YOUR OWN argument and projecting onto me your sense of entitled holier than thou attitude. I really CBF that you're biased. I do care that you're a hypocrite who acts in bad faith. My argument? They're both trash, I make no statement about who's worse because I have ONE side of the story, who admits he intentionally acted in a way to make someone uncomfortable. Which was even commented on by his family.

Gimme a break. NTA", "NTA. Strange that your sister would support your openly abusive cousin. Surely she knows in detail how he has treated you all your life. If she\u2019s glossing over this I would bullet point the history for her so she gets the message. As for Paul, he\u2019s not going to change. Also, the next time he approaches you when your bf isn\u2019t there, stand up to him and call him out.

Good for you.. i have a theory that your cousin has a secret crush on you tbh.
