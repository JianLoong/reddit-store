Honestly if you don't want drama head it off before the wedding. Tell your High School friends look my brother is dating this girl and if you do anything to her you will leave. Then follow through. Others are saying you are still a mean girl. Prove you are not. Tell your brother the truth. Out yourself.", "YTA. She accepted your apology and she hasn't told your brother how awful you were or tried to drive a wedge between you. She hasn't done anything to try to get revenge on you but you still want to exclude her. \n\nYou're still not a great person.", "In what way is it shady that she hasn't trashed you to your brother? She forgave you the instant you apologised and hasn't used it against you, I'd say those are signs of great character. Just because you don't like being reminded of what you did doesn't mean that you get to mess around with your brother's relationship with this woman by excluding her. YTA. Grow the hell up", "Info: Let me get this straight, you don\u2019t want to invite her because you think it\u2019s weird she hasn\u2019t outed you as a bully to your brother?", "YTA, and an idiot\n\nYou tell your brother that he can't bring a +1, he'll ask why. if you don't tell him, she will:\n\n\"Why wouldn't my sister want you at her wedding?\"\n\n\"Well....\"\n\nAnd then your brother will find out what an asshole you were, and how you're continuing to be an asshole towards her. And when he shows up to the wedding and people ask why she isn't there, he'll tell them - or he won't show up at all, raising further questions, and he'll tell them.\n\nAnd soon everyone in your family knows what a bullying asshole you were and how you continued to discriminate against and exclude her to try and keep it a secret.\n\nHow do you think that plays out for you?\n\nYour chickens are coming home to roost, better get ready to deal with the consequences of you being a garbage person.", "YTA \n\nYou don't sound like you've grown into as much of a better person since high-school as you credit yourself with. \n\n\"Ugly duckling phase\" you're still in your \"mean girls phase\". \n\nLet the last be the past.", "YTA.  This is real life not a Hallmark Channel movie. She sounds like she has grown up and past her high school experience.  But you do not.   What do you think she is going to do at your wedding?  Have some big scene where she calls you out?   Real adult humans tend not to do that stuff.", "YTA.\n\n\nWoooooow. So she moved on from it and didn\u2019t go telling everyone how you\u2019re an asshole? And you\u2019re in you\u2019re feelings about it? You have some issues dude. Grow up. She\u2019s an adult. It\u2019s a small town. That shit happens. You sound like you haven\u2019t changed all that much.", "YTA.  Your comment that she \"got past the ugly duckling part\" shows you are still as vile as you were in high school.  Additionally, your reason for not wanting her there likely comes from the fear that she will reveal your character.  She hasn't mentioned you to your brother, so she clearly has better character than you.  Go get some therapy because you have a lot of character flaws to work on.", "YTA\n\nYou bullied her but she's the shady one? \n\nI honestly would want her to go so you and your friends feel uncomfortable all night but in reality, If I were her, I wouldn't even want to be bothered with you.

Got it.\n\n> I still think it is kind of shady that she never brought up our past to my brother.\n\nNo more shady than YOU not letting your brother know once you realized it.

Not everyone wants to share that.\n\nIts also kind of her not to tell your brother what an asshole you were growing up.  I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s unaware of that?\n\nIf you think your friends from high school are going to be rude to her, my question back to you is why are you friends with people who would act like that?\n\nIf you ask your brother not to bring her, you\u2019re going to have to fess up about what you were/are.", "YTA.\n\n> I immediately apologized for everything and said that I had been an asshole kid and that I had grown up since then\n\nHave you grown up since then? Asking this question makes me think the asshole kid is now an asshole adult. \n\n> I still think it is kind of shady that she never brought up our past to my brother.\n\nWhat would him knowing accomplish? If anything, it'll make your relationship with him become worse. The only person who should be aggrieved is your brother's girlfriend aka the woman you bullied. You should consider yourself fortunate that she has not only forgiven you but has kept this quiet from others to save you grief and/or because she doesn't want to have to relive it.", "YTA. She hasn\u2019t kicked up any fuss - you excluding her will just raise more questions.", "YTA then, and definitely YTA now. Your comment about her getting past 'the ugly duckling part of growing up' reeks of your own insecurity and very clearly confirms that you're still that same 'not very nice' bully from high school, despite your tepid attempts to paint your adult self otherwise. Please do yourself a favour and learn from the grace, humility and generosity of this woman - you should feel lucky that she didn't slap you in the face, let alone being humble enough to be willing to attend your wedding.", "Yes.  YTA.\n\nFor being a bully in the first place. \n\nAre you ready to explain to your brother why you do not want this lady there? Are you going to fully come clean to him of all the stuff you used to do to her?\n\nBecause he will be asking why do you do not want his girlfriend there.", "This statement: \"ugly duckling part of growing up\", signifies that your moral compass is still the same...you are just more considerate of how people will view your actions.

Why did you feel the need to mention \u201cI guess she got past the ugly duckling part of growing up\u201d. You didn\u2019t need to say that. I think you are incredibly lucky that she seems to love your brother enough that she never brought up how you treated her. You were a mean girl then and you are still a mean girl!", "YTA. Show her that you are an adult and you can own up to your mistakes.\n\nMaybe prep your friends before hand and let them know what's going on.\n\nWorse comes to worst, if she makes a scene at your wedding you can still come out on top if you just admit to everyone that you did those things and apologize again.", "YTA. It's good that you apologised to her, but now you want to punish her again by not inviting her. Your brother is going to want to know why you don't want her there. Sooner or later you're going to have to talk to him and confess your past history with her, or this is going to become a big problem in the future", "YTA \n\nYou peaked so hard in high school you can\u2019t let go.", "So, it sounds like she did you a solid by not telling your brother everything and what a shitty kid you were... And now you want to exclude her?  Yta...", "YTA. \n\nYour brother's GF accepted your so called apology  while at the same time not ratting your past behaviour out to him. She has done you a huge solid and now you want to double down on being an AH to her!?", "YTA you were a bully and you still are.

What gross comemtary about her. Sound like youre still a childish bully.", "that shame you\u2019re feeling? you should be feeling it. \nthis woman is clearly willing to let things go for the sake of her relationship with your brother and your reaction is to punish her and your brother?\n\nyep, YTA.", "YTA and a nightmare of a person.", "Info why would your brother come to your wedding after this?", "YTA.  You apologized. She accepted.  Now you want to do the mean girl thing to her again.  If she marries your brother, that will be awkward.  Of course you would be ok not being invited to his wedding, right!", "YTA", "YTA. You tormented someone, good you've recognized your fault, BUT, you don't get to weasel out of it.

This is your brothers plus one, respect that, and move on to enjoy your day.", "YTA. She's the shady one? How about prove you have grown up by admitting it to your brother yourself?\n\nSounds like you haven't changed THAT much, you just realized that you couldn't get away w/ bullying adults as easily.", "Are you worried that your friends will bother her?

Time for you to remember to act like a mature adult and polite host towards all those who will be coming to your wedding.", "Yes YTA.

Inviting her to your wedding, even though your friends are going to be there, is the best way to prove to her that your apology was genuine, and not just trying to save face. In fact, invite her to whatever gatherings you have in the meantime and have all your friends apologize to her, too.

She's seemingly accepted your apology, understood how much you regret what happened to her, etc, so it's unlikely she'll do anything at your wedding if she was being honest. If she was being dishonest (I think unlikely but I obviously don't know her personally) and tried to pull something at your wedding then it's on her. Uninviting her would just be you avoiding potential confrontation. \n\nI think the best thing you can do from here on is ask if you can have a serious conversation with her and your brother/her boyfriend where you fill in your brother on what's happened, apologize again, and try to reach out as friends, engage in her interests the normal amount, etc. That way she'll see you willing to embrace awkward situations, recognize that not only are you sorry for what you did but humble yourself to her, and in the future if she's the one or sticks around long term you won't have to worry again about awkward meetings", "YTA.
