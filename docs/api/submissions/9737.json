Honestly if you don't want drama head it off before the wedding. Tell your High School friends look my brother is dating this girl and if you do anything to her you will leave. Then follow through. Others are saying you are still a mean girl. Prove you are not. Tell your brother the truth. Out yourself.", "YTA. She accepted your apology and she hasn't told your brother how awful you were or tried to drive a wedge between you. She hasn't done anything to try to get revenge on you but you still want to exclude her. \n\nYou're still not a great person.", "In what way is it shady that she hasn't trashed you to your brother? She forgave you the instant you apologised and hasn't used it against you, I'd say those are signs of great character. Just because you don't like being reminded of what you did doesn't mean that you get to mess around with your brother's relationship with this woman by excluding her. YTA. Grow the hell up", "Info: Let me get this straight, you don\u2019t want to invite her because you think it\u2019s weird she hasn\u2019t outed you as a bully to your brother?", "YTA, and an idiot\n\nYou tell your brother that he can't bring a +1, he'll ask why. if you don't tell him, she will:\n\n\"Why wouldn't my sister want you at her wedding?\"\n\n\"Well....\"\n\nAnd then your brother will find out what an asshole you were, and how you're continuing to be an asshole towards her. And when he shows up to the wedding and people ask why she isn't there, he'll tell them - or he won't show up at all, raising further questions, and he'll tell them.\n\nAnd soon everyone in your family knows what a bullying asshole you were and how you continued to discriminate against and exclude her to try and keep it a secret.\n\nHow do you think that plays out for you?\n\nYour chickens are coming home to roost, better get ready to deal with the consequences of you being a garbage person.", "YTA \n\nYou don't sound like you've grown into as much of a better person since high-school as you credit yourself with. \n\n\"Ugly duckling phase\" you're still in your \"mean girls phase\". \n\nLet the last be the past.", "YTA.  This is real life not a Hallmark Channel movie. She sounds like she has grown up and past her high school experience.  But you do not.   What do you think she is going to do at your wedding?  Have some big scene where she calls you out?   Real adult humans tend not to do that stuff.", "YTA.\n\n\nWoooooow. So she moved on from it and didn\u2019t go telling everyone how you\u2019re an asshole? And you\u2019re in you\u2019re feelings about it? You have some issues dude. Grow up. She\u2019s an adult. It\u2019s a small town. That shit happens. You sound like you haven\u2019t changed all that much.", "YTA.  Your comment that she \"got past the ugly duckling part\" shows you are still as vile as you were in high school.  Additionally, your reason for not wanting her there likely comes from the fear that she will reveal your character.  She hasn't mentioned you to your brother, so she clearly has better character than you.  Go get some therapy because you have a lot of character flaws to work on.", "YTA\n\nYou bullied her but she's the shady one? \n\nI honestly would want her to go so you and your friends feel uncomfortable all night but in reality, If I were her, I wouldn't even want to be bothered with you.

Got it.\n\n> I still think it is kind of shady that she never brought up our past to my brother.\n\nNo more shady than YOU not letting your brother know once you realized it.

Not everyone wants to share that.\n\nIts also kind of her not to tell your brother what an asshole you were growing up.  I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s unaware of that?\n\nIf you think your friends from high school are going to be rude to her, my question back to you is why are you friends with people who would act like that?\n\nIf you ask your brother not to bring her, you\u2019re going to have to fess up about what you were/are.", "YTA.\n\n> I immediately apologized for everything and said that I had been an asshole kid and that I had grown up since then\n\nHave you grown up since then? Asking this question makes me think the asshole kid is now an asshole adult. \n\n> I still think it is kind of shady that she never brought up our past to my brother.\n\nWhat would him knowing accomplish? If anything, it'll make your relationship with him become worse. The only person who should be aggrieved is your brother's girlfriend aka the woman you bullied. You should consider yourself fortunate that she has not only forgiven you but has kept this quiet from others to save you grief and/or because she doesn't want to have to relive it.", "YTA. She hasn\u2019t kicked up any fuss - you excluding her will just raise more questions.", "YTA then, and definitely YTA now. Your comment about her getting past 'the ugly duckling part of growing up' reeks of your own insecurity and very clearly confirms that you're still that same 'not very nice' bully from high school, despite your tepid attempts to paint your adult self otherwise. Please do yourself a favour and learn from the grace, humility and generosity of this woman - you should feel lucky that she didn't slap you in the face, let alone being humble enough to be willing to attend your wedding.", "Yes.  YTA.\n\nFor being a bully in the first place. \n\nAre you ready to explain to your brother why you do not want this lady there? Are you going to fully come clean to him of all the stuff you used to do to her?\n\nBecause he will be asking why do you do not want his girlfriend there.", "This statement: \"ugly duckling part of growing up\", signifies that your moral compass is still the same...you are just more considerate of how people will view your actions.

Why did you feel the need to mention \u201cI guess she got past the ugly duckling part of growing up\u201d. You didn\u2019t need to say that. I think you are incredibly lucky that she seems to love your brother enough that she never brought up how you treated her. You were a mean girl then and you are still a mean girl!", "YTA. Show her that you are an adult and you can own up to your mistakes.\n\nMaybe prep your friends before hand and let them know what's going on.\n\nWorse comes to worst, if she makes a scene at your wedding you can still come out on top if you just admit to everyone that you did those things and apologize again.", "YTA. It's good that you apologised to her, but now you want to punish her again by not inviting her. Your brother is going to want to know why you don't want her there. Sooner or later you're going to have to talk to him and confess your past history with her, or this is going to become a big problem in the future", "YTA \n\nYou peaked so hard in high school you can\u2019t let go.", "So, it sounds like she did you a solid by not telling your brother everything and what a shitty kid you were... And now you want to exclude her?  Yta...", "YTA. \n\nYour brother's GF accepted your so called apology  while at the same time not ratting your past behaviour out to him. She has done you a huge solid and now you want to double down on being an AH to her!?", "YTA you were a bully and you still are.

What gross comemtary about her. Sound like youre still a childish bully.", "that shame you\u2019re feeling? you should be feeling it. \nthis woman is clearly willing to let things go for the sake of her relationship with your brother and your reaction is to punish her and your brother?\n\nyep, YTA.", "YTA and a nightmare of a person.", "Info why would your brother come to your wedding after this?", "YTA.  You apologized. She accepted.  Now you want to do the mean girl thing to her again.  If she marries your brother, that will be awkward.  Of course you would be ok not being invited to his wedding, right!", "YTA", "YTA. You tormented someone, good you've recognized your fault, BUT, you don't get to weasel out of it.

This is your brothers plus one, respect that, and move on to enjoy your day.", "YTA. She's the shady one? How about prove you have grown up by admitting it to your brother yourself?\n\nSounds like you haven't changed THAT much, you just realized that you couldn't get away w/ bullying adults as easily.", "Are you worried that your friends will bother her?

Time for you to remember to act like a mature adult and polite host towards all those who will be coming to your wedding.", "Yes YTA.

Inviting her to your wedding, even though your friends are going to be there, is the best way to prove to her that your apology was genuine, and not just trying to save face. In fact, invite her to whatever gatherings you have in the meantime and have all your friends apologize to her, too.

Tell her your friends are invited.\n4. Ask her how you can best support her on your day, e.g. seating arrangements.\n5. Tell your friends she\u2019s coming and no bullying will be tolerated.\n6. Anyone who dismisses the past or still makes hurtful comments is still a bully.  You will want to rethink your friendship with them.", "We get it. You peaked at high school.\nNot mentioning your past to your brother is not shady.

Are you and your friends still jerks that would pick on her?\n\nSounds like she's got a crap ton of class. Good luck explaining to your brother why he doesn't get a plus 1.", "YTA clearly you are still a bully", "YTA\n\nYou say you\u2019re not a bully anymore. Prove it. Don\u2019t exclude this woman - excluding her is just a continuation of the bullying.\n\nThe guilt is yours to bear.

You apologized, which is good. But clearly you haven't taken responsibility for your shitty behavior because now you want to punish your brother and his SO because of how you used to behave.

Own up to your past and don\u2019t shelter your bully buddies by keeping her away. There\u2019s a reason you feel bad and you should all experience it. She seems the most mature here by either not upsetting your brother with this revelation (yet), or maybe they did talk it through and they\u2019ve both come to terms with it.

Dude she's being an angel for you by not saying anything", "\u201cI guess she got past that ugly ducking part of growing up\u201d.

Honestly, it\u2019s your wedding, invite who you want. But she\u2019s probably going to feel like you\u2019re bullying her again by leaving her out when she has a perfectly valid relationship with your brother and should be allowed to be there. Why not talk to your clique of friends and ask them to treat her like a human being instead of being assholes to her and punishing her for being a victim of you and your friends bullying.", "YTA \n.....back then and now....\nWhat if your brother marries her?  Drop your childish mean bs...you sound like the same kind of person you were..   fyi, she did you a favour not telling your brother about your shady behavior..", "YTA and still a bully by the looks of it.", "YTA, you need to be honest with your brother, she is being quiet for the sake of her relationship, but you should tell him, apologise to her again, and be prepared to get some very uncomfortable questions about the shit you put her through.\n\nBecause the first time they fight that shit is coming out and it will get aired publicly.", "Your an Asshole and I hope he brings her and hope you feel like shit the entire wedding and have to explain to your wife why.\n\nBut hey, I bet you were reeeeeally cool in hs tho. \ud83e\udd71", "Holy cow.

And it's hating on a woman for whatever superficial reason. Misogyny comes in many different forms.\n\nYou're also making errors in your logic.  It's tying worth to looks... as the op is the one judging their bf's gf's looks. Although it's also probably tied to what you said. OP likely ties their attractiveness as a large portion of their \"value\". This is predominantly a male trait, as they started the whole system of rating attractiveness on a scale of one to ten. It's pervasive and a social malignancy that should be rooted out.", "you can be sexist towards men too.. men also fall victim to the patriarchy and are targetted by misogyny.... telling a man he has to be \"manly\" is sexist..."]}
