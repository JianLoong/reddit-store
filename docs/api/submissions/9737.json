He said that he was bringing his girlfriend.  The girl from Christmas.   So I guess she never mentioned me.  \n\nI kind of want to ask him not to bring her.

Honestly if you don't want drama head it off before the wedding. Tell your High School friends look my brother is dating this girl and if you do anything to her you will leave. Then follow through. Others are saying you are still a mean girl. Prove you are not. Tell your brother the truth. Out yourself.", "YTA. She accepted your apology and she hasn't told your brother how awful you were or tried to drive a wedge between you. She hasn't done anything to try to get revenge on you but you still want to exclude her. \n\nYou're still not a great person.", "In what way is it shady that she hasn't trashed you to your brother? She forgave you the instant you apologised and hasn't used it against you, I'd say those are signs of great character. Just because you don't like being reminded of what you did doesn't mean that you get to mess around with your brother's relationship with this woman by excluding her. YTA. Grow the hell up", "Info: Let me get this straight, you don\u2019t want to invite her because you think it\u2019s weird she hasn\u2019t outed you as a bully to your brother?", "YTA, and an idiot\n\nYou tell your brother that he can't bring a +1, he'll ask why. if you don't tell him, she will:\n\n\"Why wouldn't my sister want you at her wedding?\"\n\n\"Well....\"\n\nAnd then your brother will find out what an asshole you were, and how you're continuing to be an asshole towards her. And when he shows up to the wedding and people ask why she isn't there, he'll tell them - or he won't show up at all, raising further questions, and he'll tell them.\n\nAnd soon everyone in your family knows what a bullying asshole you were and how you continued to discriminate against and exclude her to try and keep it a secret.\n\nHow do you think that plays out for you?\n\nYour chickens are coming home to roost, better get ready to deal with the consequences of you being a garbage person.", "YTA \n\nYou don't sound like you've grown into as much of a better person since high-school as you credit yourself with. \n\n\"Ugly duckling phase\" you're still in your \"mean girls phase\". \n\nLet the last be the past.", "YTA.  This is real life not a Hallmark Channel movie. She sounds like she has grown up and past her high school experience.  But you do not.   What do you think she is going to do at your wedding?  Have some big scene where she calls you out?   Real adult humans tend not to do that stuff.", "YTA.\n\n\nWoooooow. So she moved on from it and didn\u2019t go telling everyone how you\u2019re an asshole? And you\u2019re in you\u2019re feelings about it? You have some issues dude. Grow up. She\u2019s an adult. It\u2019s a small town. That shit happens. You sound like you haven\u2019t changed all that much.", "YTA.  Your comment that she \"got past the ugly duckling part\" shows you are still as vile as you were in high school.  Additionally, your reason for not wanting her there likely comes from the fear that she will reveal your character.  She hasn't mentioned you to your brother, so she clearly has better character than you.  Go get some therapy because you have a lot of character flaws to work on.", "YTA\n\nYou bullied her but she's the shady one? \n\nI honestly would want her to go so you and your friends feel uncomfortable all night but in reality, If I were her, I wouldn't even want to be bothered with you.

Got it.\n\n> I still think it is kind of shady that she never brought up our past to my brother.\n\nNo more shady than YOU not letting your brother know once you realized it.

I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s unaware of that?\n\nIf you think your friends from high school are going to be rude to her, my question back to you is why are you friends with people who would act like that?\n\nIf you ask your brother not to bring her, you\u2019re going to have to fess up about what you were/are.", "YTA.\n\n> I immediately apologized for everything and said that I had been an asshole kid and that I had grown up since then\n\nHave you grown up since then? Asking this question makes me think the asshole kid is now an asshole adult. \n\n> I still think it is kind of shady that she never brought up our past to my brother.\n\nWhat would him knowing accomplish? If anything, it'll make your relationship with him become worse. The only person who should be aggrieved is your brother's girlfriend aka the woman you bullied. You should consider yourself fortunate that she has not only forgiven you but has kept this quiet from others to save you grief and/or because she doesn't want to have to relive it.", "YTA. She hasn\u2019t kicked up any fuss - you excluding her will just raise more questions.", "YTA then, and definitely YTA now. Your comment about her getting past 'the ugly duckling part of growing up' reeks of your own insecurity and very clearly confirms that you're still that same 'not very nice' bully from high school, despite your tepid attempts to paint your adult self otherwise. Please do yourself a favour and learn from the grace, humility and generosity of this woman - you should feel lucky that she didn't slap you in the face, let alone being humble enough to be willing to attend your wedding.", "Yes.  YTA.\n\nFor being a bully in the first place. \n\nAre you ready to explain to your brother why you do not want this lady there? Are you going to fully come clean to him of all the stuff you used to do to her?\n\nBecause he will be asking why do you do not want his girlfriend there.", "This statement: \"ugly duckling part of growing up\", signifies that your moral compass is still the same...you are just more considerate of how people will view your actions.

Why did you feel the need to mention \u201cI guess she got past the ugly duckling part of growing up\u201d. You didn\u2019t need to say that.

Show her that you are an adult and you can own up to your mistakes.\n\nMaybe prep your friends before hand and let them know what's going on.\n\nWorse comes to worst, if she makes a scene at your wedding you can still come out on top if you just admit to everyone that you did those things and apologize again.", "YTA. It's good that you apologised to her, but now you want to punish her again by not inviting her. Your brother is going to want to know why you don't want her there. Sooner or later you're going to have to talk to him and confess your past history with her, or this is going to become a big problem in the future", "YTA \n\nYou peaked so hard in high school you can\u2019t let go.", "So, it sounds like she did you a solid by not telling your brother everything and what a shitty kid you were... And now you want to exclude her?  Yta...", "YTA. \n\nYour brother's GF accepted your so called apology  while at the same time not ratting your past behaviour out to him. She has done you a huge solid and now you want to double down on being an AH to her!?", "YTA you were a bully and you still are.

Sound like youre still a childish bully.", "that shame you\u2019re feeling? you should be feeling it. \nthis woman is clearly willing to let things go for the sake of her relationship with your brother and your reaction is to punish her and your brother?\n\nyep, YTA.", "YTA and a nightmare of a person.", "Info why would your brother come to your wedding after this?", "YTA.  You apologized. She accepted.  Now you want to do the mean girl thing to her again.  If she marries your brother, that will be awkward.  Of course you would be ok not being invited to his wedding, right!", "YTA", "YTA. You tormented someone, good you've recognized your fault, BUT, you don't get to weasel out of it.

Tell her your friends are invited.\n4. Ask her how you can best support her on your day, e.g. seating arrangements.\n5. Tell your friends she\u2019s coming and no bullying will be tolerated.\n6.

You should too", "This is almost the same plot as the movie You Again. \nExcept from the bully\u2019s view point.

And from the title of this post, you can see that I am not really the best person. I have a close friend who we'll call Jana (28F). Jana and I have not always been friends. \n\nIn HS, I constantly teased her, calling her the nerd of the class cause I was an insecure as$ (she got really good grades). Maybe because I teased her, other people also started teasing her on her grades. She had confronted me privately about this and I did stop teasing her after that since I got embarrassed. The class prolly thought that it was an old joke now and stopped too. \n\nIt was in college that we finally became close. we saw each other at a reunion and we realized that our universities were near. Since then, we regularly hung out and became close friends.\n\nI invited her to my wedding as a bridesmaid and she gladly accepted. During the wedding toasts, she recounted the bullying she went through from me, saying \"I can't believe we're friends even though you bullied me all throughout high school.\n\nI don't know if she was joking when she said that. I've made my best effort to make it up to her and apologized time and time again. She accepted my apology each time, even laughing it off that I was overthinking. I thought we had finally put the past behind us.\n\nAfter the toasts, I was hurt and confused but decided to talk to her later because I wanted to enjoy my wedding. But during the party, my sister/MOH came up to me worried, saying that there have been a lot of people asking Jana about the bullying and she was detailing every single thing I said.\n\nI had my sister get Jana and I talked to her privately in the back, asking why she brought up the bullying and she got offended. She said that she was just telling the truth. I replied that it was okay to talk about this, but at least on a different time and situation. She called me an AH for invalidating her feelings because it was true that I bullied her. I ended up crying and she walked out.\n\nNow there are rumors that I bullied her again after some people saw Jana walking out. My in-laws have also inquired about the matter too and have been quite cold to me even though I've already explained the matter.\n\nMy mom, sis, and husband are on my side but a few friends from my circle said that I ad to deal with the consequences of my past actions. I understand that I really hurt her, but I really thought we've moved past this or at least would bring it up again privately instead of in front of a whole crowd. I just don't think that it was the right time and place given that our relationship is quite close and she never brought it up again in the 7 years we've been friends. AITA?", "YTA Not sure how much you have grown up. You're still engaging in bad behaviour that will hurt this woman plus you sound defensive and jealous. Come clean to your brother.

Instead she confronted you politely and the issue should have been laid to rest. If your conscience is still pinching you it means you haven\u2019t actually done enough to make up for what you did.

Do you really want to make a move right now that will definitely ruin your future relationship with her as a sister inlaw? She's forgiven you.

When you make your speech to the bride, tell everyone (and HER) that you are lucky to be loved and that you havent always been such an endearing and empathetic person. That you used to be a bully.

Not telling your brother about your shared past isn\u2019t necessarily weird; it can simply mean that she\u2019s ready and willing to leave the past in the past, particularly if what you describe as bullying was basic mean girl behavior (mean comments, exclusion, etc.) and didn\u2019t venture into the territory of physical or mental torture.

You regret how you treated her in high school. What about the other members of your clique? Do they feel badly as well? If you are worried about how they might treat her, why don't you address *their* behavior with *them* instead of excluding *her* from the wedding?

Just your apology alone may have healed a lot of the hurt you caused.

Hm, maybe because you said and did horrible things to this girl, stuff she doesn't really want to say outloud, maybe comments about her appearance she doesn't want to say to her bf. Then there's basically explaining to her bf why his brother is an asshole and then there's the potential of an argument over it. If she forgives you easiest to just let all that go.\n\nYour old friends and fellow bullies will be there? I mean that's not her fault. This is further victimising her, we bullied you way back when so you can't be near us now. This logic is like I'll ban minorities because racists will be there.", "YTA. She was gracious and accepted your apology. Seems  like you\u2019re still an asshole if you can\u2019t get past the reminder of being a shitty human.", "YTA for sure. You can certainly tell your brother, just be ready for him to be less inclined to want to be there to support you on your day.", "Sounds like you\u2019re a little threatened by how she turned out.

You haven\u2019t grown up as much as you think you have if you\u2019re still bullying this woman. You apologized and she thought you meant it. How are you ever going to explain this to her? You can\u2019t. God forbid he marries her and she wasn\u2019t invited. You\u2019ve literally set yourself up for NC with your brother.

I understand you probably don\u2019t want her there so no one says anything to her; but she\u2019s on her way to becoming family. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mention anything to your brother because she wanted to give you a chance, and she didn\u2019t want to be petty. She sounds like a very forgiving person and I think she deserves to witness a happy day for you! While I know you want her away to prevent her from getting \u201cattacked\u201d (I say this as in bullied or someone having a problem with her), if you really cared about her and your brother you\u2019d let her come.

The fact that the gf is willing to have the courage to show up to the wedding and maintain a relationship with the brother even though she knows she will have to face that reminder every time family functions happen I give the gf tremendous credit. \n\nI believe you still have some growing up to do OP, take a page out of girlfriends book", "You know I remember an Instagram reel on the subject.
