I consider him my nephew (not \u201cstep-nephews\u201d) and provided the same amount of money for him in my will as I did for my niece and other nephews. \n\nI\u2019m sure that whatever you are saying to your daughter, your new grandkids are picking up on how you feel about them. I hope you\u2019re not making those poor kids feel \u201csecond class\u201d.", "NTA. Your money your rules. If your daughter wants those kids to have $50k each she should start saving her own money.", "NTA- Please convince your child to go to therapy. If you can, offer to pay for it for her.", "Well, tell your daughter basically everyone here is saying NTA :3", "NTA\n\n\"... told me not to contact her if I don\u2019t change my mind\"  <------- Best thing I read here.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s your money", "With her track record, I don\u2019t blame you! And the kids are almost grown, it\u2019s not like she married their dad when they were toddlers and you watched them grow up.  As long as you are kind to them and give them nice gifts on birthdays and Christmas so they don\u2019t feel left out.  That always seems to be the big thing in blended families anyway.  The only way they\u2019d know about the other grand kids getting $50,000 is if your daughter stirs the pot by telling them.  And she should have never brought it up to her husband.  NTA", "NTA... At this moment in time you do not have a relationship with these children. \nYour daughters history indicates you may not have time to build one is she keeps trading in families.  \nI'd just say that this is how you feel at this moment and being bullied by her will not help.", "NTA at all. Your daughter is out of her mind. You don\u2019t owe those kids anything", "I started reading this ready to go you're the A .... Until I read your reasoning and what it was actually about. Yeah, you're NTA. I have a step-grandfather who I see as my grandad and I'm sure he loves me like his own grandchild, difference is he's been in my life since I was 8 years old and that relationship has been built over many, many years.", "NTA - your money your choice.", "NTA.", "[removed]", "If OP had been in these kid's lives since they were young, the daughter would have an argument. But these kids are near adults, so OP at best is to be respectful, and maybe toss them a token amount at graduation", "This is brilliant! Ask her that step grandparents allocate the same amount they\u2019re leaving their other bio grandkids ( doesn\u2019t have to be 50000). On another note, I hope you\u2019re able to reach your grandkids even without their mother. Let them know you love them.", "I'd tell her the money for her kids now has to be split an extra two ways. Grandparents are not an endless resource. Committing 150k to the grandkids is very generous already.", "[removed]", "I'd just say that this is how you feel at this moment and being bullied by her will not help.", "Tbf even if it was treatment he likely still wouldn't be the AH because of the kids ages. He's presumably known the bios since birth so that relationship will always be different and most teens are unlikely to want to spend huge amounts of time around some random old dude they don't know/aren't related to. Being friendly and not excluding entirely them is a completely reasonable amount of effort in that situation that's before you get to its her 3rd marriage! Not to mention his bio grandkids might just need a break from the new family so saying bios only can be completely fair as the kids might not be able to tell their parent they want time apart and grandad can step in and be the bad guy.", "If the kids know about the money, that's the daughter's fault and she should be the only one having to live with that consequence, too.", "Nah she'll just stay for the money", "Info: Why are you punishing the kids for your daughter's behavior? If you're really worried about them not being in your life in 2 years, set aside \\*all\\* the money into one pool, with the provision that'll be divided equally between grandkids that are actually functioning members of the family when it's time for distribution.", "Your daughter refuses to see you unless you give each of her mid-teens step-children in recent marriage #3 fifty thousand dollars?  Wowza, wee touch of extortion, anyone?\n\nDon't indulge this ridiculous demand.  Comfort yourself with the knowledge that your daughter's marriages tend to be rather short, so she may well be back quite soon.  Hopefully not with a whole bunch of new step children she demands you give tens of thousands of dollars each.\n\nNTA", "It's your money and your choice to whom you wanna gift it to. Hell, you can give it to your neighbor who's proven to be helpful to you if you want. NTA.", "That\u2019s a lot of money to commit to step-grandchildren from a potentially unstable commitment. See how the marriage goes first. NTA.", "NTA. These sound like children with whom you don't yet have a relationship. And as you say, they have other grandparents. If she is expecting that you immediately settle large sums of money on two teenagers you have only recently met, she is not thinking clearly.\n\nIs it because she doesn't already have children and feels that somehow she has to be 'treated equally' to other siblings whose children have received money from you? (to be clear: this would in no way be a reasonable position for her to take, but I'm trying to understand the background to her request, which seems quite strange to me).", "Yeah tell the daughter to bugger off, you don't owe the other grandchildren anything in the slightest", "Definitely NTA. Daughter needs a reality check. 3rd marriage? Those maybe her stepchildren but that doesn't mean you have to treat them a your grandkids.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n Just cause she has srepkids doesn't mean the family has new niblings/grandkids. You chose to have stepkids, not me.", "The audacity! She just wants to give your money away to kids you barely know? Crazy. NTA.", "Nta. This is heartbreaking to me. My ex son in law (we got him in their divorce, kidding but we love him like our own. He stepped up & is raising our grandson) had a live in gf. I included her kids in a lot, then it became expected. I wasn't allowed to do or spend anything on my grandson unless her kids got the same or better. Dad didn't know but she would take it out on my grandson. It all ended badly. I love & miss her boys very much (they arent together anymore partly due to that) but its all or nothing w her. Didnt matter that her family didnt acknowledge my grandson or that her kids had their own family to do these things with. There is nothing wrong w loving steps, but they don't have to be equal & it should be mutual. And it definitely shouldn't even be a thought if you arent even particularly close w them. Its your money. She wants to lose contact, let her. She will be back", "Don\u2019t contact her!? Sounds like your other kids and grandkids just got more cash to go around NTA", "Put the money in an account for \u2018them\u2019. If they\u2019re around when you die, they get it. If not, have it split between the bio grandkids. It\u2019ll get your daughter to shut up, and you won\u2019t have to give them the money if they disappear from your life.", "NTA. These kids have their own set of parents and grandparents. Why should they, because of you, receive more than your own grandchildren?\n\nPlus why should a marriage of hers cost you 100k? And if she divorces and marries again with 10 kids, you'd have to fork out a million? How come your daughter is so entitled?", "Here I was thinking you were treating them differently in being kind or not getting them presents or something on holidays or their birthdays. \n\nNTA. You have valid reasons for your decision and your daughter can\u2019t expect you to cough up another 100k for two kids that you don\u2019t really know or might not be around forever.", "NTA", "NTA.\nBut consider this: Do your grandchildren receive anything from their step grandparents?", "NTA. She\u2019s being entitled and unreasonable.", "NTA you aren't bank of any gkids.  You are gma to the children whom are biological your & those you choose to be gma too.  You are still being gma your just not bank of 3rd marriage gma.\n\nTell your daughter if she likes to deal I'm ultimatums you will be keeping your biological gkids money & giving it to them when they are old enough to not require guidance from such a poor excuse for a daughter.  \n\nYour daughter needs to stop trying to look good & realise she looked dumb after divorce #2.  She needs to focus on fixing her not finding others to fill the void in her.  Her idol threats are hollow. Letter enjoy her silly bed she is making for herself & her kids.  She is an egg.", "Cue the mariachi band", "She\u2019ll contact you when the marriage is over. Count on it.", "Yeah, good point, DontAskMeChit (love your username btw :D). What are the parents or the grandparents of the non-biological grandchildren contributing with to the benefit of the biological grandchildren? I also don't understand this view that once someone marries / starts a relationship with a partner who has children, those children must automatically be made part of the family in absolute terms - care, affection, financials, time spent, etc. Treating children with kindness, welcoming them in a family and making sure they're safe and having a nice time are different things than setting up trust funds.", "I thought this same thing, but I agree with you, it's too risky.", "I think this is grandma, not grandpa, u/mmfparty?", "My guess: new guy is pushing daughter to share her kid's 50K with his children, and she'd rather have her parents pony up the cash.", "Brilliant!", "Bingo", "Op said they met a month after the divorce", "NTA. Tell your daughter get real and that's it is delusional she'd think you'd for over $100,000 to near adult kids you don't know. Yes daughter!!! you are wrong and get over it", "Wow, how entitled your daughter is.  I guess when you set up the grandkids trust fund you were both working.  She now wants you to dip into your retirement $ for her step-kids.  You are perfectly right for not agreeing & when this marriage fails she'll come crawling back to you.  I do hope though, that she's not told hubby & his kids about the funds as that we be very cruel", "Nta, that's a lot of money no one is entitled to. Your daughter needs a reality check!", "OP NTA - as someone mentioned, the children's bio grandparents most definitely won't be adding your bio grandchildren to their savings/funds. \n\nAll kids have their own grandparents who can take care of their own grandchildren.", "NTA. It'd be unfair to your own grandkids. Non-bio grandkids would get spoiled by father's side, mother's side, AND step-mother's side?\n\nYou get to decide who you spoil, not your daughter. You don't have to treat them like your grandkids if you don't want to. You do you and keep your money within your bloodline.", "NTA\n\nAt first I thought this was going to be something along the lines of getting cheap Christmas/birthday presents for the step grandies and giving your bio grandies expensive gifts (that would have made you an AH, IMO) in front of them.\n\nBut no, you're talking BIG amounts of money/investments and your logic for this is perfectly reasonable. That's something their bio grandparents can do for them. It's not down to you to fund every child that comes attached with your daughter's choice of partner at any given moment in time.", "Ok, so its not about treating them the same, its about giving them money. This is not about you being distant from them or not getting them christmas gifts. \n\n50k is a large amount, and I am betting you did not just give it to the kids in one day. Mostly likey came from years of savings. \n\nNow your daughter wants you to do the same to her step kids in no time at all. This is a ridiculous ask from her. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA what u did previously has no bearing on the current situation  assisting if u can for college money for extra expenses is a decision u make then. \nNot rn your daughter is being unreasonable to ask you for that. Hopefully your daughter finds her \ud83e\udde0 \nGood luck", "[removed]", "Welp....I guess yall are on a break then", "I was ready to say you were from the title, but very much NTA", "NTA. I'm all for treating step kids like family. But we are not talking about toys and vacations. That's a lot of $$$.", "NTA. It\u2019s your money and nobody is entitled to it.  Bio kids usually get inheritance because it was likely, in part, inherited from a previous generation. \n\nWith that said, I\u2019m absolutely not going to be one of these people who have 300,000 saved for their grandkids. What ducking universe do you boomers come from? My MIL apparently has a half million dollars in stock that she\u2019s sitting on until her death, doesn\u2019t want to plan for it, too boring for her. \n\nIf youth is wasted on the young then wealth is definitely wasted on the old.
