She just wants to magically appear $100,000 to the bank accounts of the teen children of her new husband.  Pfft.. she has lost her mind.   Go ahead and celebrate the new grandkids on birthdays and Christmas like they are your own.", "NTA.  Ask your daughter if her child's step-grandparents are adding money to her kids college fund?

This isn't a matter of you refusing to have a relationship with your new step-grandkids - this is a matter of a rather large amount of money to suddenly be asked to give to people you have, at best, just met. You don't have a relationship with these children yet. Now, if in a few years you have developed a relationship with them, that will be your choice. \n\nI can appreciate your daughter wanting to advocate for her new family, but emotional blackmail is not a way to go about it.", "NTA. \n\nIt would be different if you had been in their lives since they were tiny and they had grown up with you as grandparents, but these are teenagers with grandparents of their own.", "NTA, it\u2019s a ridiculous demand.", "NTA, why should you give 100 grand to people that you just met. Your daughter is off her rocker.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of money. \n\nThey have other grandparents to spoil them and leave them inheritances (potentially). If this daughter has bio kids, has their new step dad\u2019s family promised to give them $ and treat them equal in wills/inheritance?\n\nI may tell her that if a legitimate grandchild/grandparent relationship of closeness develops with the children, you may consider making provision for them in your will. But then she might encourage them to develop a phoney relationship.", "NTA, but humorous considering your daughter suggested you should post here. I think she believes people would\u2019ve been on her side lol.", "NTA, it's your money and you have a right to say no.", "NTA because they're already teens. If they were still toddler aged, I think it would be very different.", "NTA", "NTA. you could always tell her you will revisit the issue when they are ready for college in just a few years. 3 years from college - it\u2019s not like you would get much interest on the investment anyway.", "NTA. but be careful. Your daughter may want to speak to your manager or leave you a bad yelp review", "NTA. These kids came into your life as teenagers, even if you started saving for them now there would be so much less time. \nI would say nice Christmas gifts and birthday gifts are all that is required.", "NTA.\n\nIt is your money and you get to decide what to do with it.  It's not clear if any of your previous grandchildren belong to this daughter, but I imagine she wouldn't think it was fair to split that child's money with their new step-siblings.  Same goes for the cousins, I would think.\n\nAgain 100% your choice, but if you decide to do something it should be over time.   I doubt the other grandkids got $50K with their first pack of diapers.  \n\nI thought this was going to be about how you actually treat them as human beings.  Of course  in that sense you should treat them the same, but when teenagers come into your life you're not going to know them that well.  So you'd be friendly but not overfamiliar.  As you said, they have their own grandparents.", "NTA. And trust me, your daughter will be speaking to you again as soon as it suits her own interests. But no, her demand was ridiculous.", "NTA. You barley know these kids and no one is entitled to your money or to dictate how you spend it! Info hope that you treat them nice/kindly when you do see them though.

Otherwise, NTA.", "NTA - It's the kids + daughter & her husband's job to pay for these kid's schooling. You've already been incredibly generous with the 50K/ea for the biological grandkids.\n\nThat said, I do understand how this might hurt the feelings of the teenagers. I'm sure they're trying to learn their place in this new family dynamic. Maybe there are ways to build a relationship with them that don't involve you spending 100K. Some fun ideas might be 'When each of them graduates college if you're still married I'll treat them to a vacation to X place as a family' or something that's more focused on building memories with your new family members", "Tough spot. I was ready to say grandpa is the asshole for not treating all the grandkids, equally, step or biological. However, before I read anything, I assumed this was about spending time, choice of words, attention, and so forth\u2026.\n\nThat is a lot of money and everyone\u2019s lucky as fuck that they\u2019re able to get anything, but to expect every kid that pops into his family to be given 50 grand doesn\u2019t seem realistic. Grandpa had nothing to do with raising those kids and he has no clue what their financial habits/ responsibilities are like. \n\nI assume mom has a nice inheritance coming to her when her dad passes so maybe she should just give her a new step kids money from that pile", "Do what she asked. (NC) NTA", "NTA.\n\nA personal anecdote:\n\nMy parent's obituary in the newspaper contains the names of all their surviving children and their partners, grandchildren and their partners, and great-grandchildren. Among all these names are a bunch of kids I will call \"step-grandchildren\", whose mother or father was very briefly in a relationship with one of my siblings around the time my parent died. And I mean **very** briefly, like a few months in one case.\n\nThey are not listed as step-grandchildren. Their names are just mixed in with all the others. (The wording of the obituary was not my choice. I never would have included them if I'd had a say in the matter.)\n\nMy parent was never the grandparent of these children, but I feel like their obituary is forever cluttered with the names of these people who meant little or nothing to my parent and whom I will never see again.\n\nPerhaps it is petty for me to still be resentful about that, but you can't help the way you feel.\n\nNow, if I'm allowed to be slightly resentful about something so trivial as names cluttering up an obituary, you are allowed to be resentful at someone's demand that you hand over a very large chunk of change to people that you don't feel you're related to, and (if your daughter's history is any guide) have a good chance of not being permanently in your life.\n\nYour daughter suggested you post here? I suspect your daughter is going to be disappointed by the verdicts.", "NTA for not wanting to set money aside for kids you barely know. \n\nI came from a divorced home, and my mom remarried numerous times. I can say that as a child and teen, the step-families that treated us like interlopers were awful to be around. The ones who treated us like grandkids, nixes, nephews, etc, were the families I remain close to now. \n\nThe marriage situation is not the kids fault. They get no choice in the families they get dragged into. Don\u2019t add to that by choosing to treat them differently.", "The petty in me would offer to split her bio children\u2019s share with her step-children. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d show her true colours really fast and refuse to do that. I doubt she even sees her step-kids as hers. She\u2019s trying to hustle you for money.", "This is tough. We were the step grandkids but the divorce and remarriage was before any grandkids. My step grandma was just known as grandma and she loathed us. She never wanted us around and would get upset anytime my grandpa invited us over. I heard her commenting once about my appearance and was unhappy I had \u201cmore looks\u201d than her granddaughters. She bought her \u201creal\u201d granddaughters computers and musical instruments and spent time with them. I got a box of used lipsticks and told I looked exotic. (We are all white.)  I was a child and never understood why she didn\u2019t love us or want to spend time with us. For us though it wasn\u2019t about money. We just felt unwelcome in our own family.\n\nI can understand not setting aside 50k for teenagers you just met, but for the love of god respect them and get to know them for who they are and build a relationship with them. They didn\u2019t choose any of this and deserve to be loved. \n\nESH but the kids", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
