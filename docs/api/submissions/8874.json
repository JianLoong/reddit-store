{"id": 8874, "submission_id": "10qx0kv", "title": "AITA for unintentionally saying he eats too much?", "selftext": "I'm at a loss here. Since I got together with my fiance 5 years ago I have noticed that he is always thinking about food. He eats breakfast as soon as he wakes up (like 10-11am), eats a really big lunch at like 12-1pm and then he snacks all the way up until dinner. Has a really big dinner and then has easily 8-10 snacks OR multiple full plates of leftovers before he goes to sleep. He eats enough for a family of 5 and we spend over $1200 in food monthly. He has always been between 220-240lbs but he's also tall. I actually gained a bunch of weight when I first got with him because he always wanted me to eat when he did and if I didn't he took it personally. He just loves food and thinks everyone else should feel the same. \n\nWell I'm honestly considering the possibility that I may be developing an eating disorder. I'm literally never hungry anymore and this was after having this absolutely sickening feeling in my gut whenever I thought about eating and it was due to how much food he always had and wanted me to eat with him. I started hating the taste of damn near every single food he offered me and now it's to a point where I get hungry once a day, will try to eat and absolutely hate the taste and can only finish maybe half a plate before I feel so full that I'm about to burst. I'm not hungry at all for the remainder of the day. This only started happening within the past month.\n\nI've talked to him about it multiple times and tried telling him that I can't eat like he does and don't want to either because I'm getting fat. I hate myself and how I look now. And he always says that I'm starving myself if I won't eat because I'm legitimately not hungry. So yesterday he wakes up at like 10:30ish AM and immediately is leaning over me (I was taking a nap) asking me where I wanted to go get food. I told him I wasn't hungry and he said \"babe yes you are. You need to eat. Let's go get Chinese.\" I was exhausted and beyond pissed about this resentment I feel against food that I just blurted out that he eats way too much and it's grossing me out that he tries making me do the same. He translated this to me calling him fat. He is overweight but I didn't even mention his weight. AITA?\n\nETa: I never said I blame him for the eating disorder. No where in that paragraph did I say \"it's his fault\". However, when you are being basically force fed despite you saying no, it does become an issue. I've also stated in my post that I have communicated this multiple times. Therefore the people telling me I need to communicate more than I already have are really just justifying why the bar is set so low. I've always communicated.", "created_utc": 1675264207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qx0kv/aita_for_unintentionally_saying_he_eats_too_much/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has a problem. NTA and he might have binge eating disorder. It\u2019s not healthy for him to push his eating habits onto you.", "Is he a cat? I'm assuming so, since my cat wakes me up to eat constantly. \n\nBut seriously no, NTA. This is really unhealthy, and his lack of listening to you about what you eat is concerning in terms of a lack of respect for you.", "I'm at a loss here but it sounds like you both have an unhealthy relationship with food and need to talk to someone.", "I was prepared for you to be the AH here because commenting on the amount people eat is rude AF. Then I read about his desire to change your eating to match his, and waking people up to ask about food is obnoxious for anyone over about 8 years old. You get to eat when you're hungry, as does he, and it doesn't need outside commentary. He can eat on his own if he is randomly hungry. I am going with NTA instead of e s h because waking anyone up to badger them about food is enough to set anyone off. This may be a counseling issue for the two of you together. Food is too big a component of life to have such divergent views and stay together. Definitely deal with this before you get married or have children.", "This is going to be a tough one for the two of you to sort out.  It is ok for you both to have different needs to food, however you both have to be understanding and supportive of the other.   You also have to understand that this may not be a surmountable obstacle--food is the one addiction that you cannot just quit and it sounds like food, if not an addiction for him, is at least something he is extremely focused on.  \n\nRealistically, it sounds like you do not need nearly as many calories as he does (typically, women need fewer calories than men and you are probably smaller than him)  and that even takes his being possibly overweight out of the equation.  So he needs to understand that and  back off the pushing you to eat.  That would be the first conversation.   \n\nThen you need to figure out what you are going to do with him the does not involved eating.  Because if he is eating or thinking about eating even 75% of the time (and it sounds like more), then what else do you two have in common?  Those are the things you are going to have to focus on.  Otherwise, what are you supposed to do?  Sit and watch him eat every hour?  I can see how that could turn you off of food!  \n\nWhich leads to the thought that, yes, in fact, his relationship with food is negatively impacting your relationship with food.  So you need to sort the out with the appropriate professionals.  Fortunately, that will also help you push back when he tries to tell to eat when you do not feel hungry.  \n\nSo, while yeah, that wasn't the best way to phrase it, I'd still say NTA.  Because as soon as someone told me that they know how my body feels better than I do, I would not have been nearly as polite as you were.  \n\nAlso, if he is that focused on food and you are not, then you may have to stop and evaluate whether the two of you are compatible.  That's a hard thought, however it really may not be possible if you two cannot come to terms with such a difference in an essential life function.", "NTA.  Not sure why is trying to force feed you.  I do think the two of you need some outside help, especially if his attitudes towards you and food are causing you to have eating issues.", "NTA but...This is a tricky one because I believe you both have an unhealthy relationship with food and it is triggering you when he puts pressure on you to eat even when you are not hungry. He should not be doing that. Especially if you have an eating disorder it only makes it worse. Trust me i have an issue with ED myself. He could actually have an ED too and is binge eating or maybe he has an underlying health issue and that is why he eats alot of food. I think boundaries need to be put in place and you both should go and speak to a professional about your eating habits. I think you also should have a calm conversation with him and apologise for snapping at him and possibly hurting his feelings. He should apologise for pressuring you to eat because it is pushing your boundaries and its not OK. Healthy communication is needed here", "You're NTA here. \n\nIt sounds like you're just so tired of having to deal with this and having everything be about food. He sounds pretty defensive about it (and about trying to \"blame\" going out for Chinese or whatever on how you need to eat).\n\nHe's literally (figuratively?) giving you an eating disorder. If you said \"the way you eat is making my relationship with food very unhealthy\", you would just be saying the truth in a direct but not-complete-asshole way.", "NTA. Your outburst was unnecessary and rude for sure, but the greater evil is how he treats you. He has an unhealthy outlook on this relationship if he can\u2019t handle different appetites. You have every right to eat on your own schedule, and he has no right to try and tell you when you are or aren\u2019t hungry. I think you two would seriously benefit from couple\u2019s counseling to sort this issue out.", "NTA.  It slipped out in the wrong moment before you had a chance to filter it, but what did he expect pushing someone who just woke up? A university lecture?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd his fixation with you eating even though you've told him it makes you uncomfortable is kinda creepy IMO. If he responds that badly to you commenting on his eating (which, unlike yours, seems to be dangerous), he does NOT get to constantly comment on yours!", "I hope you\u2019re not helping pay for the grocery bill cause wtf", "I can definitely relate to this. My partner has very different eating habits than I do. He doesn't eat food, he inhales it. Honestly, he can win food eating contests hands down. He was a wrestler and his diets were definitely different than mine. He will do a full breakfast of steak and freaking eggs, I don't eat breakfast. Etc... it took me awhile to set boundaries and say no to what I don't want. Nta for sure. Hopefully you guys can talk it out.", "NTA\n\nThe two of you need to sit down and have a serious talk. Is he truly eating because he's so hungry all the time? (Like maybe he has some kind of thyroid or other issue?) Or is he just eating out of boredom? (Like if he tried testing himself and eliminating a few \"snacks\", would he truly miss them?)", "NAH. He may be trying to push you to eat out of a misguided attempt to help, because he notices you're eating less.\n\nIt's also not wrong for you to feel the way you're feeling. I mean $1200 a month in food for two people is insane. \n\nIf he's up for it, and you're willing to put in the effort, I have two options. \n\n1) take away some of the food budget to hire a nutritionist for him (or both of you, since you're developing issues now)\n\n2) help him figure out better complex carbs. It isn't healthy for him to be eating as much as he is, and he may have his own ED. It's also odd that he isn't gaining incredible amounts of weight eating that much, so he may have some deficiencies that require medical attention. \n\nHe needs supplements, most likely, because he may be eating so much due to an innate need to fill a deficiency, but his body isn't reading that signal properly. You're just so icked out by the food that it repulses you.\n\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation, all around, and I hope you both come out the other end happy and healthy, whether together or separate.", "NTA. Food addiction is a real thing, it could be an escalation of binge eating disorder or a severe case of it. It is not OK for him to force feed you to normalise his constant feasting. Also, the food bill, my God, it\u2019s huge. People do go into debt for addiction or untreated ED so you need to be careful here. I think you were pushed to the edge by him and became frustrated. There\u2019s no perfect polite way to approach this if he\u2019s in self denial about it.", "I actually think he has a binge eating disorder, and trying to make you eat with him, so he doesn't feel as bad about it.

He needs to stop forcing you to eat!   It sounds like he may have a food addition and he feels better about it when you\u2019re eating too.", "NTA. He putting to much pressure on you and costing you a lot of money with the amount of food he consumes.  Please get some therapy and ask him to do the same.

NTA but I don't think this relationship is a healthy one for you.", "NTA but you aren't compatible and his style of eating is deeply affecting you in a negative way. You should break up asap before he affects you more.\n\nIt is a hard truth that sometimes small things about a person make them incompatible with who we are. Since he obviously can't accept how you want to eat (which makes him a huge AH, btw) he is not a safe or good partner.\n\nWhat you are feeling is distress not just at food, but at how he is treating you. He's trying to control how you eat and not listening to what you want, which is a scary place to be with someone you want to trust.", "I'm leaning toward NAH from N T A. OP, I HIGHLY recommend getting into therapy. When you started describing how you feel with food, that's exactly how I feel with food when I'm anxious. I also realized that I was walking a thin line to an eating disorder. It's a horrible feeling, and the longer you let this go, the more issues you're going to have trying to get back to having a healthy relationship with food. You need to get into a therapist who specializes in eating disorders and have your partner come in at a certain point. The therapist should be able to explain to him what's happening with you and help create some boundaries with him. Your partner is either legitimately worried about you, or he's got his own unhealthy relationship with food that he's trying to push onto you. Either way, you can't control him, You CAN control your own relationship with food, and you CAN get him to stop trying to control your relationship with food. \n\nA lot of people who have eating disorders do so because at some point they felt they had no control and food was one of the few things they could control. You need to figure out if this is just something you need to work on with yourself, or if your partner is actively contributing to your struggles. And, what I mean by that, is that there is a difference between him eating constantly, inviting you to eat, and it's triggering for you to tell him no and to watch him eating... versus him eating all the time, pressuring you, making you uncomfortable, constantly ignoring your boundaries and trying to force you to eat with him, and you starting to develop an eating disorder because you literally feel harassed by him to eat when you don't want to. If it's the first, therapy and establishing boundaries and different routines with him might help. If it's the second, you can also try to establish boundaries, but this just might not be a healthy relationship. I mean, if you've ever watched My 600 Pound Life, it's shocking the number of partners that are actively pushing their partners to keep eating. A lot of those people only get better when they leave their partners.\n\nSo, get into therapy. Until then, come up with some boundaries (these are just suggestions):\n\n\"I no longer want you to ask me to eat.\"\n\n\"I do not want you to make any comments about what I'm eating or not eating.\"\n\n\"I do not want you to talk to me about food.\"", "Very difficult one here but unfortunately, ESH albeit the husband more so especially the remark. He needs to understand boundaries and not get offended so easily, but you yourself could have made it clear much earlier instead of going along with it for so long that you just are not as fanatical about food as he is (disregarding eating disorder as nothing established on the facts)", "This sounds like abuse to me.", "NTA. You\u2019ve tried and tried and he just keeps steamrollering your boundaries and very real health concerns. I hate to be a Reddit stereotype \u201cbreak up\u201d person, but if he doesn\u2019t acknowledge that he\u2019s hurting you and cut that shit out, you need to consider it. This isn\u2019t a healthy relationship! Emotionally and physically. You\u2019re showing signs of trauma and developing an eating disorder! All because he can\u2019t accept you controlling your own food intake. That\u2019s fucked up. \n\nSlight tangent - It is definitely possible he has binge eating disorder, but have you ever looked into \u201cfeeder/feedee\u201d kinks? I remember a post a while ago where the OP\u2019s partner was pressuring them to eat constantly and sabotaging their diet, all the while claiming they have no idea what OP means, they SUPPORT them. It turns out the partner got off on OP gaining weight/eating and was deliberately and secretly trying to make OP gain against their will. Gaslit the fuck out of them. Cared more about his kink than OP\u2019s health/comfort. Just a thought.", "NTA. Honestly, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a bad person either, but it sounds like he at least doesn\u2019t understand you. I don\u2019t want to interject too much here, but it honestly sounds like things aren\u2019t working out between you two.\n\nIn my last relationship, I was so depressed and stressed out that my appetite was gone. I\u2019m always hungry, but I lost like 10 pounds in a month and I wasn\u2019t even going to the gym.

These aren\u2019t issues to ignore.", "NTA - so he thinks it\u2019s fine for him to comment on your eating habits, but the reverse is bad? Double standards are always A H territory. On top of it, he is controlling your behavior. The pressure you are feeling and your body\u2019s reaction are symptoms of abuse. Whether or not he has bad intentions is irrelevant. Most abusers don\u2019t think they are. But control is a key characteristic of abuse.\n\nI would immediately start seeing a therapist and start working through some of these issues. You need to move out asap. Whether or not the relationship is salvageable is dependent on what you determine with your therapist and his willingness to change. If you want to try and salvage it, you need couples counseling so he can work through how he is treating you, as well as his own individual therapy.\n\nYou are being bullied, even if it\u2019s being delivered with care and concern. You don\u2019t have to live like that. Get out, and good luck.", "Well, YTA\u2014ish (a little bit.)\n\nBoth of you were at wrong. He was only concerned about you because for sure he notices your change of eating habit, but he's still pushy. And you said some hurtful words.\n\nAll in all, it seems like both of you needs to go and have a check with a doctor \u2014 maybe both of you have eating disorder, just the opposite ones.\n\nI suggest both of you sit down and have a proper talk about this!! :)", "Soft YTA. You are responsible for your own health and whatever goes into your body. If your bf eats too much food, or at time that doesn't suit you, just eat whatever you feel like, whenever you feel like.\n\nOf course you bf is going to push you to eat : eating once a day is not normal nor healthy, and he is right to be concerned.\n\nKindly, the problem here is not that your bf eat too much. It's that you have an unhealthy relationship with food. This is your problem to fix.", "YTA\n\nI can empathise with your situation. You might have unintentionally developed an eating order for your partner. Then when you were half-awake your patience snapped and you showed him how worried you are in an exasperated and antagonising way. However messed up all this is, it shows that you do care about him. \n\nSo I would recommend extending that care to his situation. If you genuinely want to help him with what does sound like an eating disorder, shaming him (even accidentally) will most likely have the opposite effect. Better to find and talk to experts on health, diet and psychology to get solid, outside perspectives.\n\nBut also, weight is highly overrated as a general indicator of health. It definitely sounds like your fiance has an eating disorder, but whether or not that will have an extremely adverse impact on his health isn't a certainty. There are so many more factors to consider.\n\nOf course, he needs to be more empathetic to your situation. No matter how you look at it, the amount of food he eats on a daily basis is, what, 2-3 times the average? The way he sees food is incredibly different to yours, and that could very well be a purely biological factor and works well for him, but it would be torture for most people.\n\nI would apologise for the outburst, and say you just need to have your limits respected. He eats a lot, and that in itself isn't evil or shameful or anything, but he needs to acknowledge that", "YTA\n\nAnd your post seems like you are saying that his eating habits caused you to have an eating disorder. The sickening feeling in your gut when you watch him eat. That. That is making him the cause.\n\nListen, everyone has different needs. I think it is sweet that he makes sure you eat. Unless he is stuffing the food down your throat, he isn\u2019t forcing you to eat. \n\nIf he is happy doing what he is doing, let him. If he wants to eat himself into an early grave, let him. At least he is happy. \n\nAlso, it really depends on what he does for work and his free time. Is it a manual labor? That requires alot of energy. \n\nIt seems that you are uncomfortable with your body and want your partner to go through the change with you. Might not happen. But you must put your foot down about having you eat with him. Maybe eat a fraction of what he eats? Or grab a cup of water and sit at the table to keep him company.\n\nI do have to say that this response is biased cuz I like my men on the bigger side and don\u2019t see a problem with the eating habits too much.
