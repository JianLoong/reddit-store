I think your mum is crazy for expecting you to. Asking you to skip college to look after their kids is unacceptable, trying to kiss you when drunk is unacceptable. They sound awful and I think you probably should stop seeing them, but that's up to you. NTA", "NTA. The kids shouldn't have to suffer because of their parents' bullshit. It's good that someone had their best interests at heart.", "NTA. You\u2019re right that their marriage is their marriage and the problems within are theirs to fix, but you were also mildly SA\u2019d by an employer who is friendly with your parents yet your mom was more concerned about causing more tension for them than she was about your well-being. Not cool. Where has Mom been while they have been swan-diving over your boundaries? I mean, asking you to skip classes? C\u2019mon. It\u2019s probably a good thing this job is over. (I\u2019m assuming\u2026.you\u2019re going to stay away, right?)\n\nYou made a commitment to the kids and followed through, so good on you for that. The play was on neutral territory and there was simply no need to hurt to the kids on top of everything else. I feel for them, because no matter how this all shakes out they are going to suffer.", "Nta.  Sounds like the parents are using you as the scapegoat for their issues. You helped the children prepare for the play and they asked u to be there. You didn't do anything wrong nor make anything worse", "NTA.  You made a promise to their children that you followed through with, it had nothing to even do with them.  It sounds like you handled the situation fine.  I think it's pretty shitty they would even ask you not to go knowing that it meant something to their children.", "NTA\n\nThe kids are what's most important here.  Kids are very self-centered (not in a bad way - just developmentally) if you had not shown up they would think it is because of them, not because of stupid choices their parent's made. They aren't really capable of fully grasping the concept of why you wouldn't be there. \n\nThose two young children wanted you there to celebrate their achievement and you promised them you would go - you went. Parents can kick rocks.", "NTA.  You have done right by the children by keeping your promise, and removing yourself from the Dad's inappropriate behavior.  I think besides the children and yourself, everyone else is TA.", "NTA- but your mom is. Ask her why she cares about a sexual predator more than her kid", "NTA, but Ellen and Joe are. You have really invested yourself in those children.  Not many people your age would have the commitment to someone else's children that you have shown to those two kiddos.  You helped the children practice their parts and you promised them that you would come.  I love that you followed through even in uncomfortable circumstances. Ellen and Joe care more about their own embarrassment than they care about the feelings their children.", "NTA  \nWell done for keeping your promise to the children despite Ellen and Joe were a massive jerk to you. It's kind of a shocker why your parents think that you're an AH, you are definitely not one.", "Stop looking after these kids. Joe got enough alcohol in him to try and assault you, and Ellen is going to make that your problem instead of facing the fact her husband is THAT GUY. Ellen\u2019s marriage is her problem though. Don\u2019t apologize, just get away from these people. Go to college. \n\nNTA", "Time to get another job.  We all see where this is heading and you're about to be painted in a bad light.", "NTA - you fulfilled a promise to their kids and sounds like you didn\u2019t even interact w the parents, good for you. THEY created the \u201ctension\u201d and their kids shouldn\u2019t suffer for it. Unless they\u2019re gonna explain to their kids that the reason their babysitter won\u2019t be there is that daddy tried to sexually assault her (obviously I\u2019m not saying to do this \ud83d\ude02), they shouldn\u2019t have expected you to bail on the play.", "NTA, but it's not that you should've left it - you should have left.  They were already taking advantage of you, and sexual assault, drunk or not, should have been the end of your relationship with them.", "You exercised a right you had, but it wasn't the safest move.

Yes, the kids wanted you there. But Joe tried to boff the babysitter. What do you think is going to cause more strife in their family: 1) you not attending the performance or 2) the young girl the husband tried to get it on with showing up after being asked not to by the wife because HE has no problem with it? You knowingly pulled the pin on a grenade in their marriage, and your excuse is that it\u2019s \u2018their problem? That\u2019s what makes you TA.", "NTA. The play was something you had already been helping the kids with, and I know they would have been hurt if you had not shown for it. However, this is a good sign that you need to start distancing yourself from this entire family.", "I agree with the parents, YTA.

I don't think she pulled the pin. I think the husband did that. \n\nI'm not sure going was the right decision still, but I can understand why it might be a tricky decision with the relationship she has with the kids. I think NTA but maybe a lesson learnt not to listen to the married person who tried to get on you. Huge huge AH to the husband though.", "Wow, you're victim blaming a *21 YEAR OLD* over the *45 YEAR OLD* man with children who tried to kiss her. The *GROWN ASS MAN* \"pulled the pin\" on his own marriage not the OP.", "Ellen asked you not to go. You went against her wishes because Joe said it was okay. Do you really think he\u2019s the one who should have veto power here? Joe is first and foremost the asshole for committing sexual assault. That should be a given, even if he didn\u2019t have a wife and two young children. But that\u2019s not the issue being judged here; you\u2019re asking whether it was okay to show up at a school play after being asked not to. You KNOW being there would cause problems because you were explicitly told so.", "Have you told your parents?", "Why are you TA?  He made a pass at you.  If he feels uncomfortable around you..  That's HIS fault.  Don't apologies", "So very NTA, and nothing to apologize to anyone for, unless explaining to the kids why you can't watch them anymore. Does Ellen know Joe tried to drunkenly SA you in their house? I'm wondering if she does, and is turning her anger towards you instead of dealing with the real problem. If your parents are critical, maybe they need to know about his drunken antics as well. You should never put yourself in a situation like that again, for your own protection.  \nGood luck in school, have a nice life, and block these fools.", "NTA Ellen and Joe are both awful. You are rid of both of them.", "NTA but I think it's time to stop babysitting these kids unless you want to be in the middle of the dad's nanny fantasy drama.", "Oh it's all out now , Joe been having feelings he just knew it was too perv to make a move sooner, she just wants your to apologize, because she cant truly be happy not being the victim just because husband was inappropriate,  you are the victim because they have been mistreating you and taking advantage,  not the sexual harrassment made it worse , she knows she doesnt have cards to play so when you to the play,  she thought maybe she had a card in you coming trying to play like it was worst than what her husband did, but I would advice to distant yourself and get help so that you can continue on with your life with to much trauma", "NTA. This man literally sexually assaulted you. They're lucky you didn't call the cops. Thanks for keeping your promise to the kids. I'm so sorry for you and for them that likely your relationship with them is over because their parents are AHs. Your mom is also a major AH. She should be more concerned with the sexual assault that her friends' marriage.", "NTA, but do not put your education in jeopardy for these people.

How about Ellen?\n\nYou shouldn't have to endure being told you are an AH when in fact, it was Joe that attempted to assault you.\n\nI would at the very least tell your parents what happened.

I am so sorry that the Dad betrayed your trust like this - but I also think it was a bad move to attend the play. Leaving the situation completely is the only right move in my opinion -   just because the children asked you to go doesn't mean you should. If you are no longer looking after them, all ties should be cut with this family. If the mom said she's uncomfortable with you attending her child's play, I think it's inappropriate to go.", "NTA - OP was SA'd but parents say SHE is the AH?  um, No way.  He is a predator and should be reported.", "I think the being harassed part has been glossed over by OP which disturbs me somewhat. NTA and stay away from this family from here on out. And tell your mom her friends are basket cases.", "Does your mom know what happened with Joe?", "\"I'm sorry, I should have realised that, when your husband sexually assaults your friend's children and you decide to stay with him, seeing those children would be uncomfortable for you.\"", "I think besides the children and yourself, everyone else is TA.", "The kids are minors - if the mom didn't want her there, it's overstepping to attend tbh. And it wouldn't be traumatizing for them if she didn't\nattend, things happen all the time and these kids are 7-9. At that age, kids are much more capable than you are implying. She no longer babysitting them so saying she's unable to attend/busy wouldn't be shocking.\n\nI think this situation is unfortunate since it's obvious OP and the kids have a bond (and their dad messed up the whole situation) but you would have had to part ways at some point and coming to terms with that now is much healthier than creating ambiguous lines like this.", "Didn\u2019t have to, Ellen was upset with Joe she told them he tried to cheat and it came out what happened. But he was just drunk.", "I don\u2019t think he does, I think he was just drunk", "\"you pulled the pin on a grenade in their marriage\"\n\nyeah OP is such an asshole, how dare she be the victim of sexual assault", "Likely but she still made a commitment to those kids before all this went down.", "I would agree with the above, there's a reason it was Joe that told you it was okay for you to attend. He wanted to see you again.\n\nAlso, drunk actions are sober thoughts, is the way the phrase goes, I believe. Drunk is not an excuse here, and you need to cut this family off and then ask your mother why she's okay with this man sexually assaulting you. Because he did.\n\nNTA", "Apparently you just don\u2019t know how to read.", "Oh, I 100% agree.", "lol ok"]}
