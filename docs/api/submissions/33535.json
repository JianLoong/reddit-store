This isn't a conversation about lying. It's a conversation about not outing people.", ">Would Lonnie want Angel to just flat out say no in that case (and explaining why so Angel can be ok with it), or give an answer like \"I don't think that's any of your business\" etc.\n\n\"Not your business\" almost always sounds like \"yes, but I'm not saying that\"\n\nWould be much better to say something like \"I have no idea\" or get really offended/pissed off and go with something like \"how often do you think I've seen my dad's gfs genitals you weirdo?\"", "Or autism.  I have never been able to lie because of mine.", "Teenagers think in black and white.  It's possible she sees lying as a betrayal of a LGBTQIA+ person.  An idealistic 15 year old maybe thinks \"People shouldn't have to lie about who they are!\", and has extrapolated \"...so it's disloyal and harmful to LGBTQIA+ people if *I* lie about who they are!\".  She may even think it's wrong and cowrdly for *any* LGBTQIA+ person to conceal their identity for any reason.  \n\nAngel's plainly has no problem with Lonnie being trans, and she may be horrified with the idea that anyone else might be.  Maybe she doesn't want to accept her own family is transphobic.  For teens, it's often tough to reconcile that sort of issue.", "Then you should be teaching your daughter the difference between lying and respecting someone's privacy, particularly in situations where they are not sure they will be safe from unfair consequences for who they are. Hell, if she grew up on Disney at all, Mulan (animated at least, haven't seen the live) has a perfect demonstration of this that may help it click with her, when Mulan is nearly executed for the crime of being a girl.\n\nOtherwise, look to history for examples.

All my friends did too.", "Do you mean when your family starts spewing unprompted homophobia & other bigoted hate, you want her to silently swallow it instead of standing up for hate & bile directed at people like her soon to be step mother? \n\nYou know you can stand up against hateful rhetoric without marrying or even having any relationship with anyone in the LGBTQ community just cause it\u2019s wrong & you should give comfort to bigots.", "You should be aware that while your daughter might agree to not bring it up, it might accidentally slip out of her in the course of conversation. Kids (even teenaged ones) often have trouble censoring information that way.\n\n\nAgain, I\u2019m NOT saying she would intentionally blurt out that your fianc\u00e9e is trans, but it\u2019s possible she would unintentionally mention something that would make that status clear. So putting your daughter in that position is not only unfair to her, it\u2019s possible it will lead to the information being mentioned despite your daughter\u2019s best efforts. \n\nRegarding direct questions your family might ask your daughter about your fianc\u00e9e, you shouldn\u2019t ask her to lie. Instead, provide her with something she can say that is true and that does not disclose the information in question. \n\nFor example, you could request that she say, \u201cI really think that\u2019s something you should discuss with my dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, not with me\u201d, or \u201cI prefer to not discuss other people\u2019s intimate details; I think if you want to ask that kind of question, it\u2019s best to ask the person in question, rather than a kid.\u201d\n\nBoth of those statements are true, and let the questioner know it\u2019s inappropriate for them to be asking your daughter that question.", "Nope, never ask a child to lie for you.

So if you're in a straight relationship what are you lying about? Lonnie is MTF and you love this person. You two are LGBTQ, don't get your daughter to lie.

Even little kids understand the idea of telling grandma you love that ugly sweater she gave you...\n\n>An idealistic 15 year old maybe thinks\n\nYes, but we are talking about this 15-year-old, who thinks lying is wrong. Especially on Christmas. You are ignoring what she actually said in order to come up with some elaborate explanation.

He doesn\u2019t want to discuss it yet because he\u2019d rather try to fool everyone first and have them take a liking to her before revealing her situation.  That\u2019s totally valid, albeit unlikely.

Nothing wrong with that at all but telling yourself you are straight isn\u2019t fooling anyone and likely confuses your daughter even more as she feels she\u2019s lying about you too", "Smh.
