He's pulling a classic DARVO on you, accusing YOU of the thing he's done to upset you.", "NTA.  Why are you with him again?", "NTA, your boyfriend is being incredibly heartless. I\u2019d suggest doing some thinking and figure out if this kind of attitude is something you are ok with your partner having", "NTA. I have an EX-husband who acted like this when my grandfather, whom I was very close to, was hospitalized for cancer and then died. He just didn't care and asked, \"Why are you crying? It's just a grandparent.\" Yeah. The marriage didn't last much longer. Dump this guy.", "NTA and I honestly would have gone for N A H until the comment about him suffering because of your parents.  People need to blow off steam and dealing with some serious stuff, you need a break to take your mind off of things.  I totally understand that, but he was a dick with that comment.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re going through A LOT right now and he\u2019s not making you a priority. Saying he shouldn\u2019t \u201csuffer\u201d because of your parents is just fifty shards of effed up. \n\nWhen people show you who they are.. believe them.", "Empathy? I hardly know her!\n\nBut seriously does this \"boyfriend\" feel human emotion?", " NTA. Dump him. If you don\u2019t then YTA!!!", "NTA. He is showing you who he is and what you really mean to him. Leave him, he isn't ever going to be available to you emotionally. Honestly he's probably hoping you break up with him so he doesn't have to feel like the bad guy when you're already having a really hard time.", "After 5 years you'd think he'd care about your parents. When my ex husband and I were still just engaged, had been together about 3 years at the time, he was out of town and I had a medical emergency. I called his parents from the hospital, as we lived in the same town as them while my parents were further away. They were there with me in the hospital and let me stay in their guest room and took care of me once I was out before my husband got home. You, quite reasonably, expect your future partner to have a feeling of familial connection with your family, especially if you have a strong relationship with them and they consider him family. NTA. He doesn't seem to care about your parents or your feelings/mental health. Totally reasonable for you to have that be a requirement from a life partner. I've been divorced from my ex for 3 years (we share children) and I'd STILL show up for his parents if they were in the hospital or if there was anything at all they needed.", "NTA. Your partner is supposed to support you during difficult times, even if it doesn\u2019t directly impact them. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s so callous and rude to you, nobody should be treated like that.", "the fuck? He's not acting like he doesn't care. He doesn't care. Ditch this asshole, help your parents recover, find a real man next time", "NTA.  OP should really reconsider the relationship:  BF doesn't seem to want to offer emotional support whatsoever.  He may be using the family crisis to leave the relationship.", "You\u2019re absolute NTA.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to go through this and with no support from an apparently massive AH. How he\u2019s been behaving is absolutely awful and definitely not how someone in a relationship should behave - timeline aside but even more so after 5 years! I honestly cannot understand how he thinks that his behaviour is acceptable in the slightest.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a bit of food for thought. When my now husband and I first got together (within the first 2-3 months being together so very very new) my Nan was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. Myself, my sister and my Mum provided her palliative care and also took her to the hospital frequently due to her pain. We worked out a \u2018rota\u2019 between the 3 of us and would do 12-24 hour \u2018shifts\u2019 - the 24hr was closer to her passing as there needed to be 2 of us there at all times.\n\nNow this absolute Angel of a man took time off work when I was at home and would come over to cook me meals (he knew I wasn\u2019t eating properly and I was recover from a severe eating disorder at this time as well), he would clean the entire house for me, do all the washing etc. He would even drive an hour to my house from his to feed my cats when I was away, often doing so before going to work night shift. He would finish work and pick up shopping for me, have food ready for when I came in and just generally supported me in absolutely anyway he could - including picking me up from the hospital when I was too exhausted to drive (I had been awake for 48 hours at that point), this hospital was an hour away from his place and 2 hours away from mine. He then carried me upstairs to my bed and had to keep checking on me as I was asleep for 24 hours straight.\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t over a long period of time, unfortunately she passed exactly one month after being diagnosed. She declined extremely rapidly.\n\nHe without a doubt made one of the most difficult times of my life a lot easier to cope with. That\u2019s what partners do, they support you in both your highs and lows, they don\u2019t drag you down from a high and they don\u2019t make your lows more difficult\n\nPlease tell this \u2018man\u2019 to shove it, he\u2019s not worth your energy and doesn\u2019t deserve to be the recipient of your caring nature\n\n\nETA - so husband just came through and noticed I was a bit upset (I still struggle talking about this at times) so I showed him your post and my comment. He\u2019s just made me a coffee and is now giving me a cuddle - that despite this happening just over 4 years ago.\n\nHe also says you\u2019re NTA and several expletives about your boyfriend that I probably shouldn\u2019t repeat haha", "NTA.\n\nI seriously recommend taking a good look at this relationship and where it\u2019s going. Because it doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere. Your partner should be the person you can turn to when things are hard. He has shown that you and your feelings don\u2019t matter to him.", "NTA your boyfriend is a mon$ter", "It\u2019s not the emergency he doesn\u2019t GAF about, hon. The emergency is just what shows you he never GAF about you. NTA.", "NTA, even if he hated no one as much as your parents found them the most despicable in the world thats certainly not the issue. He is failing to support YOU. What kind of bf thinks it\u2019s a punishment to actually comfort his partner.", "This man has no empathy at all... yikes. The least he could be is supportive. \nPlease break up with him.\nNTA", "What Relationship?", "You aren't being unreasonable at all.  He's not being a partner nor does he care to be.  If he's not a partner after 5 years, then that's an answer.  Relationships aren't always simple, easy, and joyful.  At times one has to carry a greater load and he's not interested in that when you need the support.", "Your expectations are for him to care at all about you and your parents. He clearly does not.\n\nIf I\u2019d been dating someone for five years and their parents were in the hospital, I would think I\u2019ve developed enough of a relationship with them that I\u2019d want to be at the hospital as well. But being actively dismissive of your trauma when you\u2019re back? That\u2019s unforgivable.", "Come on, really? What your partner should have done instead of barbecue: stay with you, listen, offer comfort, make life easy for you and show empathy. Nothing of that here.\n\nYes, it\u2018s not fun to watch someone suffer and there\u2018s very little one can do but literally leaving you to yourself, that\u2018s not a partner, and you deserve better. \n\nAnd I am so sorry that your parents have to go through this.", "Dump him girl. Life is short. You\u2019ll end up with a loser that doesn\u2019t have empathy.", "I agree. This isn\u2019t over something trivial, this is dealing with OPs parents -SIMULTANEOUSLY at that. \n\nIf he can\u2019t muster any sort of empathy, support or sensitivity in this situation, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s a person worth fixing things with. There are plenty of partners out there who would support you without being asked to.", "This dude is 40?! Honestly, I was picturing him as like 17 or something. Just doesn't sound like the actions of an empathetic, grown ass man. You're not being unreasonable expecting support and consideration from your partner during a trying time. And you should probably re-evaluate any relationship that makes you think you don't deserve that.", "You\u2019ve been with him for 5 years and he has met your parents once?  NTA and normally I hate when Reddit immediately goes to break up or divorce advice but this man is a roommate at best and has no respect for you.  I\u2019m sorry it took a time like this for him to show it. I hope you have other support through helping your parents navigate these changes.", "First, I'm so sorry for everything with your parents & I hope you have support outside of your bf. \n\nSecond, his behavior now & during the entire relationship are all red flags. It's all his way & not yours. He doesn't want to meet your family, but you *have* to be around his. He's unwilling to show you any kindness or support during a difficult time, which isn't how a good & loving partner behaves. That's selfish behavior. You deserve better than this. \n\nRight now, he's behaving like a roommate with benefits (at best) rather than a partner. I know it might be hard, but being single is far better than keeping someone like him in your life because the only person he cares about is himself. You can't change him & he's far too old to be behaving this way. Please cut your losses & take care of yourself.", "* SHRIEKS INTO THE ENDLESS VOID* HES 40?????\nI thought you were both 18. Oh my god", "I've had strangers, both online and IRL, be more supportive in a bad moment than this guy.", "Hell, when my grandma died I had a breakdown on campus and a complete stranger walked me to the bus stop to make sure I was ok. This guy has less empathy for his partner of five years than that stranger had for someone he knew for all of five minutes.", "I def took it as the red flags are glaringly obvious that OP knows what to do without having to think too much about.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I was held while I cried. You deserve WAY better.", "Yes.  I would expect my partner to rearrange his life when I'm in crisis - because I would do it for him.  NTA.  And PS - he the one acting like a child", "If my partner was in your situation, I couldn't imagine spending my time like nothing is wrong. Even if he doesn't directly care about your parents, the fact that *you're* upset should be reason enough for some empathy. He sounds horrible.", "You're not a B, he's a D. Get out ASAP.", "Wait\u2026. No you are not a B at all. \n\nI know this is a horrible time for you but this is a small blessing to you.
