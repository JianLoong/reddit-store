I hope your parents can recover, and that you will also find a new partner with more maturity, love, and support for you.", "NTA. Sounds like he's trying to force you to breakup  so he doesn't have to do it.", "NTA. He\u2019s making a show of not giving a single measly damn.", "Who do you think is the asshole? Really. \n\nSome ppl lack self aware + common sense; your husband is one of them.", "NTA your partner of 5 years is showing you how they would act. I hope in the long run he wouldn't expect you to care or show any concern about his family. I saw your comment where you starting to despise him. Stop and look into the last 5 years first and write a list good n bad. Really see how he has processed any of your feelings.", "NTA\n\n\ud83d\udea9", "Leave.  He doesn't care about you at all.  STOP all communication afterwards.  Loneliness is better than misery.", "NTA\n\ndid you clearly state what you expect him to do? men not picking up on clue is a clich\u00e9 but it holds true most of the time.\n\nnot GAF is an effective defence mechanism. how close is he with your parents? I assume he is emotional invested in you, not your parents.", "NTA but he\u2019s shown you his priorities and you\u2019re not one of them.", "NTA - and get rid of his useless arse too! Nothing like loosing 150 pounds of baggage from round your neck! (Focus on you and your family, I'm sorry this is happening).", "NTA. \u2026but tell him he should go\u2026\u201dNo really, YOU. SHOULD. GO.\u201d", "NTA. He wants to break up but he knows he'll look bad if he's the one doing it. He's trying to make you do the actual breaking up for him. Ugh, he's awful.", "I have never dealt with true grief before. My ex\u2019s cousin died suddenly, and I had plans to go out that next weekend. He had always been the kind of person who wanted to be alone when things were bad, and I truly had no idea he wanted me there way more than I was. One day he finally told mehow hurt he was that I could just go out with friends while he was grieving like this and that I did it so soon. I felt so horrible. I learned a hard lesson that day. I was a bad girlfriend and needed to think of his feelings. I DID care but my actions did not reflect that at all. \n\nThis guy knows it\u2019s hurting you and still doesn\u2019t care. My ex should\u2019ve broken up with me, you should break up with him.", "Jesus I just have a feeling this the first time he\u2019s been so callous.", "Consider this, how would he react if you were in the hospital with critical issues? You're NTA for expecting/wanting  a sliver of support from your BF. Many red flags here.", "NTA, he's a selfish jerk. I would encourage him to take that 3 week vacation so you have time to move. He can come home to an empty place and no girlfriend. So sorry about your parents\ud83c\udf39", ">Why should I have to suffer because of your parents\n\nBecause he has sympathy, empathy, or any ability to care at all?

Was it those two weeks youve been gone? How is your boyfriends relationship with your parents? Do they like him? How is your boyfriend in all the other aspects of your relationship? Is he generally this unsympathetic?\n\nIm leaning towards NTA and your bf is AH but some further info would illuminate things more.", "NTA. First I want to say that I am so very sorry about your parents. Having both in the hospital has to be devastating. Second, honestly these events can either bring out the best or the worst in couples. You said that you have been in a relationship for 5 years\u2026I would have assumed that your bf met your parents more than a few times and would have a relationship with them. I know people react differently to these situations\u2026but now you need to think about if this is the kind of partner you want in your life going forward. Especially if more of these stressful situations pop up and he doesn\u2019t at least provide you with some comfort.", "NTA so sorry you are going through this. Your bf is showing his true self.

Believe him.", "Let him go on his 3-week holiday, while he is gone, pack up your stuff and leave his butt.\n\nIf it's your place, pack up his crap and deposit at his parent's place or a storage unit, then change the locks.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. \n\nDump him. Dump him so hard his head spins. \n\nA partner that truly cares for you would be by your side. They wouldn\u2019t care about social obligations or video games. They would care about your emotional, and probably physical, well-being. They would go to the hospital with you, they would take over cooking meals, they would give you hugs and let your talk or cry or whatever your process needed to be. They wouldn\u2019t be planning a vacation or accusing you of picking a fight. \n\nThis boy is not a good partner. He is a child. I\u2019m sure you love him, I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019ve lost 5 years to him, but his behaviour is atrocious. To say he is not treating you well is the understatement of the century. He isn\u2019t even fulfilling the bare minimum, and at this point, the bar is so low, it\u2019s practically in the 9th circle of Hell. **Dump. Him.**\n\nI truly hope your parents are recovering. Look after yourself.", "He would be an ex BF with that attitude, don\u2019t waste any more time with that one and go find a real man that cares for his partner instead of himself. Your definitely NOT THE ASS!", "NTA.", "NTA. And you are single. This is not a relationship.", "NTA. Just leave. If he\u2019s acting so so selfishly in this very serious situation, it\u2019s kind of indicative of the man he is.", "NTA \n\nYour boyfriend of five years doesn\u2019t GAF about your family emergency. He might be a great boyfriend, but he\u2019s not going to be a good life partner.", "Sweetie, I'm not glad your parents are having a crisis, but I'm glad you get to see what he's like.\nWhen he goes on that vacation, you pack one of you up and move them out. Doesn't matter which, your choice. This is not a partner, this is a *boy* friend who likes having sex and hanging out when you're in a good mood.\n\nNTA, and you deserve someone that gives a fuck how you are when hard stuff happens.

I hope that your parents are recovering as best as they can be, under the care of medical professionals. \n\nIs this the first major stressor in your relationship? If so, and if this is how he responds, it\u2019s a huge sign that he is not a supportive partner. Now that you know this you can decide accordingly how you wish to move or not move forward in your relationship.", "NTA - someone who loves you wouldn\u2019t behave like this, treat you like this or make you feel like this. I would tell him how you\u2019re feeling, calmly and rationally with examples and if he tries to gaslight or deflect, I would walk away. Better to be alone than feel lonely in a relationship.

They\u2019re dating for five years and this is his attitude. Dump him", "NTA. This. I had a similar experience with both parents critically ill at the same time. Shit got real with my boyfriend (now husband) real fast; it showed me who he was during hard times and your boyfriend is showing you the same. Unfortunately, he's selfish and frankly not a partner.

He's been invited to Christmas etc. but declined. I haven't wanted to force it as he did that to me with his family and I hated it.\n\nHe is quite black/white in his way of thinking, and I've definitely called him selfish before. Just thought it would be different in a situation like this.", "Is not unreasonable to expect a little tlc when your parents are both unwell. He might not care about them, but he should care about your feelings. If you're sad, stressed, angry, whatever he should want to help you feel better, or at least be there to console you.

He's shown the OP what kind of a person he is.", "How supportive he is?  How you see this sort of treatment going in your future?  \n\nRight now, your boyfriend is essentially saying: \"It sucks to suck\" to you and your parents without a care as to how you feel or how this impacts you.  From what you've said, he gives zero shits that this is upsetting you because it doesn't impact him.  \n\nNo matter what happens with your parents, your life will be fundamentally changed as well, and your boyfriend doesn't seem keen on being your partner through this.  And what happens if you get sick or get in an accident.

I might have given him a pass on one or the other nights, but planning on going away when your parents health is still so fragile?

My husband has helped and continues to help me through hardship, because no relationship can survive without compassion for one another. \n\nYou shouldn't settle for someone who obviously only cares about themselves. That's a doomed relationship, you'll only become more and more unhappy that he can never be what you want in a partner.", "He only likes you and is interested in your company when you\u2019re fun. The instant you have an emotional inner life and needs that aren\u2019t convenient for him and might require him to support you, he bails.\n\nThis is the early warning sign of him being the type of dude who cheats because a partner doesn\u2019t want sex while pregnant, or runs off and abandons you if you develop a serious illness. Absolute no go, in my opinion. If he can\u2019t be there for you in a stressful emergency that is one step removed he will *never* be there for you when the emergency and stress are immediate and even more demanding.", "When my dad had cancer my husband drove an hour to help take my dad to appointments or run errands to help my mom out while I was working and unable to go.", "Hey hey, parent of a 10 year old here - they have way more empathy than op\u2019s boyfriend.
