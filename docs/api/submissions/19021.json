Either he doesn't understand or he just doesn't want to.\n\n>he said \"why should I have to suffer because of your parents?\"\n\nThis is about how you feel right now and what you're going through. It's rather dramatic and self-absorbed to call it suffering.", "NTA, firstly, I sincerely wish the best for you and your parents.\n\nWhen my dad was rushed to hospital at the end of last year due to cancer complications, my boyfriend was a fucking gem. He dropped everything and became my personal chauffeur, running me to and from the hospital and later the hospice at ridiculous hours, making sure i remembered to eat etc\n\nWhen my dad passed away in the middle of the night, he'd got out of bed to drop me at the hospice at midnight, and was there by his phone when I called him 3/4 hours later to say that he'd gone. He drove round and sat in the car park until I came out. He put me to bed, helped me break the news to people, organise the funeral, empty his house and stayed by my side every single minute that I needed him. The important part is that he didn't **want** to be anywhere but by my side while I was going through this. My suffering was his suffering.\n\nThe point of my ramble is this- when you are going through the worst of the worst your partner should be right there with you, they should be a source of comfort and support not further stress.   \n\nYou are going through a traumatic and stressful experience... it is not unreasonable to want or expect support from your partner.\n\nI've upgraded my boyfriend to fianc\u00e9 since then, I don't think you should do the same with yours.", "OP I don't even know you and I wouldn't treat you this way while you're parents are in the hospital.

He should be supporting you and ensuring that you have someone to talk to instead of ignoring you. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this!! Just make him an ex because if he won\u2019t support you now and just have a little understanding then he never will", "Nta, he lacks sympathy for a long time partner.

If this was your boyfriend of 5 weeks I might cut him some slack...but 5 years he should be more invested in you and your feelings than he seems to be.", "NTA. \n\n>Why should I have to suffer because of your parents? \n\nThis is not about him suffering because of them. It's about him suffering because YOU, his significant other, are suffering. And if he is now able to suffer, at the very least he should be empathetic, and respect and be there for you at this time. \n\nI sincerely hope your parents recover as best as they can. As for him, I would reevaluate this relationship", "NTA. i\u2019m so sorry. i\u2019m currently WITH my partner, uncomfortable in his tiny childhood bed, because i went with him to support him since his grandmother is dying, as any good partner should. \n\ni understand not everyone works from home so he may not be able to do that, but the fact that he cares so little for your family after 5 years together is alarming, and clearly doesn\u2019t care about you since he\u2019s offering 0 support", "NTA, please get out now for your own sake.", "NTA.

He is showing his true colors. Also,  he is telling you , pretty clearly, that's how he  acts/reacts when you have a family crisis.
