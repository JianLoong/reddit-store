It\u2019s a branch of flowers and some wild strawberries over my right hip. My boyfriend of 7 months (19 M) was very cool with it and even told me it looked a bit sexy until I asked if he would be fine if I posted a picture of it on my instagram. He told me he was uncomfortable with it because it\u2019s not really possible to take a picture of it without my butt showing a bit. \n\nSaturday morning, about a week after I did the tattoo my mom (45 F) called me and told me she thought I would have posted a picture of it on instagram or Facebook by now. She told me she was tired of having to show family, neighbours and friends a picture of it almost daily by now. I thought about it for a day and on Sunday decided to post a picture of it. I didn\u2019t consider it showing too much or being sexual and my mom thought it was a nice picture. \n\nAbout 40min after I posted it I get a text from my boyfriend. He told me it was a real bitch move of me to post it when I knew he disapproved of it. Apparently a guy sitting next to him when he saw it on instagram had asked \u201cWhat hoes ass is that? I\u2019d like to fuck it\u201d. He also told me his friends had been texting him asking if he was really fine with that picture and apparently they\u2019ve been calling me stuff like slut, hoe and bitch. I asked what different was, since he\u2019s always posting pictures without a shirt showing his abs and two tattoos (and have girls screenshooting it). He told me that if I didn\u2019t delete the picture I didn\u2019t need to bother with contacting him again since the relationship would be over. I did delete the picture but he\u2019s still very mad at me and don\u2019t want to talk. \n\nMy friends are telling me that I did nothing wrong and that it\u2019s my body and my decision to make and that there is no difference between my picture and all the ones he\u2019s posting. (I can also add that I have about 90 followers while he has around 400). Was I in the wrong here? Should I not have posted it to begin with?", "created_utc": 1668418067, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yuty1n/aita_for_posting_a_pic_of_my_tattoo_on_instagram/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your bf is being controlling (red flag \ud83d\udea9 ). His friends are disrespectful dicks, and if they talk about random women like that you know he does, too. You are the company you keep.\n\nSooo... is a controlling, disrespectful, ultimatum-tossing hypocrite the company you want to keep?", "NTA. I don't know why you're asking your boyfriend, if it's okay for you to post pictures of your tattoo on your page. Did he ever ask you can he post his shirtless pictures? \n\nThere's clearly a double standard. \n\nHe sounds very insecure. And for him to be friends with guys that's comfortable enough to call you all those names around him, should really tell you all you need to know about him.", "NTA, very honest? That his friends talk about you like that, says a lot about how much respect they have for women. And your boyfriend is friends with these types of men?\nHe has absolutely nothing to say about what you put on Facebook.", "The reddest of flags, run run run. He has Already controlled you enough that you think you need to ask his permission to post a photo (no matter what it is of). And if his friends a really saying those things seeing a pic of you, they are not people you want in your life. And if he is with the. Then all bets that he is no different when looking at other girls pics. Dump his sexist controlling ass.", "Delete the boyfriend, post the photo. NTA", "NTA. This guy and his friends sound like losers.", "NTA\n\nHe shows you that if you want to be in a relationship,  he can tell you what to do with your body. You removing the picture shows him you are ok with that.\n\nYou could have giving him a heads up, especially because you asked him first. But he does not own you and you don't owe him that.\n\nDon't apologize for posting. If you want to apologize: do it for not giving him the heads up. \nHow did he react when people he knew called you names? Did he defend you? Did he shut them down? Because you sound like he is blaming you for his friends being a**holes in their respons to your picture.\n\nJust take this time to think about what you want from a relationship. And if you think you two are compatible. \n\nYour tattoo sounds amazing!", "More red flags that Chinese New Year. \"...when you knew I'd disapprove.\" Well you know where I'd be telling him to stick his disapproval?

Unless you both grow up there\u2019s nothing healthy or long lasting here.", "NTA..As someone with several tattoos, the last thing I ever think about when getting one, is what anyone else on the planet will think about it. \n\nYou're still young, but his behavior is absolutely unacceptable and unlikely to change. \n\nYou don't need his permission (or anyone else's for that matter) to post a pic of your body. If his friends are that comfortable calling you all those names, you should wonder what he says about you when you're not around. \n\nAs long as you like your tattoo and you were comfortable posting that pic, nothing else really matters, no other opinions matter.", "Molly, you in danger, girl. \n\nThis man is a controlling nightmare. Get away from asap, tell him never to contact you in any way again .", "I really doubt his friends talked like that. He made that up to shame and pressure you. Those are his thoughts and his words coming out of his mouth.\n\nHe\u2019s not a good person.\n\nNTA", "\"What hoes ass is that? Id like to fuck it?\" Now In no genius and I havent met every man in the world. But who the duck says a statement like that. Seems fishy to me like your boyfriend MIGHT have said it to make you take it down. \n\nYour body your choice, if your comfortable then show it off to the world. \n\nNTA\n\nEdit: you better put that picture back up because otherwise he has won. And he know he can control you.", "NTA. The original ask for his opinion on how he'd feel if you posted it created a situation where he felt like it was a joint decision with you. But he took it too far with the ultimatums. Who cares what his friends think. He shouldn't have listened to them and instead checked them for what language they use towards another human, regardless if the person in the picture was you or not. Anyways, he has follower energy. He could have expressed if he felt hurt in a real way. If he's acting mad still, he's not worth it. Teach him that if he wants to be with you, he can communicate maturely. In the future, you can let him know you decided to post a pic to circle back around to him but that doesn't give him a pass to treat you poorly now.", "Your bf is controlling and needs better friends.\n\nNta", "NTA. It's your body, not something he owns or gets to control. Don't let him shame you.", "I bet he lied, and no one said any of that. If they did, ask him why he keeps friends that speak so disgracefully about women. He's being controlling and mysoginistic, and the best thing you could do for yourself is dump him. You deserve better, and he needs to realize there are consequences for not treating women with respect. Y T A if you keep him.", "Your BF needs new friends and you need a new BF. Your body, your decision. Jeez, even your MOM thinks it\u2019s OK!", "NTA boyfriend doesn't own you", "NTA. Take him up on his offer and repost the pic and dump him. Anyone that insecure isn't good boyfriend material", "NTA. He is. WOW the misogyny is STRONG with your boyfriend and his friends. They are so disrespectful toward women. That's SO toxic. It reflects rape culture. Run away from that guy.", "NTA\n\n>\u201cWhat hoes ass is that? I\u2019d like to fuck it\u201d\n\nWhat? Did someone **really** say that? If he's not pissed at his friends for talking about you that way then he's not worth keeping around. Your boyfriend's an insecure asshole and I'd wager significant money he's lying about other people's comments.", "Your boyfriend needs to be an ex. Like, yesterday. He sounds like a misogynistic control freak. He has NO right to tell you what parts of YOUR body you can post on YOUR social media. Repost the photo and throw that man in the bin because he\u2019s trash.", "NTA - get a new bf", "NTA but you would be a massive one for staying with him. he has shown you that he wants control and it will only escalate. your friends hit the nail on the head, the only thing you did wrong was delete the photo because of him.", "NTA.   Repost the picture and find another bf.  One that respects your choices.", "Your first mistake was asking anyone permission to post a picture of your own body.\n\nYour second mistake was not posting because bf was \"uncomfortable.\"\n\nYour third mistake was then racing to post it as soon as your mother told you to do it.\n\nYour fourth mistake was deleting it when bf gave you an ultimatum.\n\nI hear Costco is selling *shiny new spines* for half price. Buy one, insert it, ghost the misogynistic AH, then spend some time as a single person trying to work out who you are and what you stand for, without a bf or parents bossing you around.\n\nYou aren't an AH, but you are a total pushover.

First of all, why is he trying to control what you post? Secondly, just know that the people he hangs around says a lot about him. There are men out there who would never talk about women this way and would NEVER let their friends talk about their partner this way; raise your standards and date one of them instead.\n\nAlso, check out his following list on Instagram. Is it full of women showing skin? If that\u2019s the case, he\u2019s being an extreme hypocrite, as he\u2019s more than willing to sexualize women while he consumes the exact sort of content he\u2019s demonizing you for posting.", "This post should be about him not responding to his friend with \"don't say that about my girlfriend, or disrespect her like that\". Wtf.", "NTA\n\nAlso I'm calling bullshit on some random dude sitting beside him who just happened to see the picture, on your boyfriend's phone and actually called you a hoe.\n\nSmells like horseshit to me.", "Nta enjoy your spontaneous tattoo your body enjoy it.", "Nta. The tattoo isn't rhe issue. The issue is you are dating someone who has friends that call girls sluts. Dump him.", "NTA; he ans his friends are for sure.

My reply if you didn't aleady tell him prior to wanting to post it would have been to either blur the area that makes him uncomfortable, or to crop the photo, so only the tattoo shows and little of anything else", "YTA because you decided to make a compromise with your boyfriend and you backed out of it because of what your mom wanted.\n\nIf you were passionate about posting on IG that would be one thing, but you went back on your word to him because of an outside party.\n\nRelationships are full of compromises, and as long as you are both loving and both making compromises then it works out.  \n\nFor some people, your bf\u2019s preference for you not to show your body online would be a red flag, but for other people standards of public modesty within a relationship are normal.  So you and him get to make this rule for yourselves \u2026 but that\u2019s not what this issue was about .\n\nThe issue was you going back on your word and letting an outside party damage your relationship.  If you had a change of heart, then in a healthy relationship you discuss it.  \n\nYour points about his posting habits are really valid, and should have been included in the original conversation , or you should have gone back and said \u201cnow that I\u2019ve had time to think about it, I\u2019m not happy about where we landed on the question of social media \u2026 \u201c\n\nYou are learning about what kind of girlfriend (and woman in general) you want to be, and he is also learning how to be a boyfriend.  If you think he is over-stepping or tending to be too possessive then discuss it .", "I agree with you. Also notice in the post that HE is telling her all his friends are saying this. I wonder if there is any proof that his friends are being disrespectful or if he is just using it to manipulate OP to take the post down.", "I agree and the fact the (?ex) bf doesn't  shut doesn't  shut  down  the insults is a huge red flag  along with  the controlling.  Find someone  who respects  you  op. Nta", "I feel that no one has actually said anything of the sort to him but he's trying to make his (shitty) opinion sound more right because her has \"people\" backing it up. But if he actually has friends saying that then he's also gross and his friends are too", "I have never loved a comment more then yours. I will be using the more red flags comment in my everyday life now. But 1000% agree with you.", "Why? If she is comfortable with what is showing, she shouldn't have to conform to his worry. That is a HIMproblem.", "This is horrible advice.  This would just make him think is perfectly OK to tell her what to do with her own body. If anything about it makes him uncomfortable, that's on him and he can figure out how to deal with it in an appropriate manner, like with therapy. OP should never have to change a picture she likes of herself because her boyfriend thinks he should be able to dictate to her what is and isn't acceptable."]}
