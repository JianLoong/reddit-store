YTA.", "Honestly, I think ESH. He should have asked whatever questions he wanted to about the house *before* agreeing to move in. If he assumed you were renting, why not ask how long your lease was and what rules there were and whatnot so he could plan ahead and make an informed decision? But you also should have been upfront about what kind of situation he was getting into. Why wouldn't you think to inform him of the details of his living situation?

I mean keeping secrets in general is bad for relationships but this has an added layer of being really odd. From his perspective, you must have some sort of motivation for not telling him, which would naturally cause trust issues.\n\nI don't think you're necessarily an asshole but are you really surprised that he's confused and having doubts?", "You would be an asshole if you would have charged him rent but you did not.

He seems like he wants to have a solid, respectful relationship with you. His asking (unprompted!) how he could contribute to the rent was really cool of him, and that probably should have been the time to tell him the truth (before he moved in would have been better).

You should have told him.", "NTA- A year long relationship does not mean he needs to know upfront about your finances or assets.  If you owned the house and didn't have a mortgage, but charged him rent- that would be AH territory.\n\nI can see why he wants to know and feels like you should have mentioned it.  But basically, he is getting a great deal just splitting utilities. And you are smart not to let him contribute to the house payment itself.", "NTA.  He takes himself way too seriously over YOUR assets.  Congratulations on being a homeowner!  So proud of you and I don't even know you!!!!", "NTA.  I have a feeling you didn't tell him because you didn't want him to feel that you have your life more together than he does.  And his response to finding out seems to be him actually feeling a bit jealous or insecure about the fact that you own your place and he's still renting.  Yes, you neglected to tell him, but it's not like you were having an affair or something.  You should be very proud of what you've achieved in owning your own home at your age!  Now that he knows and you've seen his response, you should probably charge him the same rent you charged your other room-mate, to be fair.  He's a grown man, right?  He needs to pay some rent.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t need that information and it changes nothing for him.", "YTA. If you are in a committed relationship, both of you should know everything about each other. There shouldn't be any secrets.

You'll sleep better at night", "NAH\nI get it, especially if you\u2019re still paying the mortgage. If you told him, and he wanted to help pay the mortgage, that potentially forces the relationship into a more serious situation way too fast.

You can\u2019t expect people to trust you if you mislead them about matters they consider to be important. The first time makes people wonder what other secrets you\u2019re keeping & what else you\u2019re misleading them about.

Not pay his share of the living expenses? \n\nI do not understand why people have joint bank accounts. 50/50. its not a debate. my (now ex) \"husband\", (he cheated), never knew exactly what i earned, or owned, or anything about my financial situation. None of his, or anyone else's, business. \n\nSorry if i seem bitter, but life has taught me a thing or two. A boyfriend definitely does not need to be privy to this information.", "NTA.  But I have a sincere warning from experience in my background.  You need some quick legal advice if you want to continue this.

ESH and here's why:\n\nHE sucks because he didn't press for details when you deflected. He has the right, as a financially contributing resident, to know just how the bills/rent are being paid.\n\nYOU suck for the deflection. Again, he has a right to this information.\n\nBut what sticks out to me and why I say ESH because NEITHER OF YOU BROUGHT ANYTHING UP UNTIL THAT MOMENT. Whether one gets invited to live with someone as simple roommates, or two or more people decide to live together, romantically or not, the financial responsibilities MUST BE DISCUSSED. It should be talked about if not first, then as soon as possible. How do you live with someone and not figure out what the financial system of the household will be? Will you have a system of paying for everything as an even 50/50 split? Will certain bills be paid by one and the rest paid by the other? (for instance, in my house, my husband handles rent and phone bills. I handle groceries, electric, water, and gas.) Does one of you get paid weekly and the other bi-weekly so they may have to take the bill that's due the week you don't get paid and you catch the next one. All sorts of things. I just don't understand how this never came up once between the two of you before move-in day. So, ESH", "YTA and this is just a really weird thing to lie about.

Once you told him no rent he should have known.", "NTA. Moving in doesn\u2019t automatically entitle anyone to your financial information. If you\u2019re not at a stage to know each other\u2019s salary, then you\u2019re not ready to discuss assets. If he wants to know your financial situation, then he should be disclosing his as well. It needs to be a both sharing situation or it puts one partner in an uncomfortable position of not knowing. \n\nMoving in is typically when people begin talking about real numbers though, so it\u2019s slightly odd neither of you felt comfortable saying what financial position you\u2019re in. The number one stated cause of divorce in the US is financial, so it\u2019s pretty important for people to be open about that with someone they intend to marry. But if you don\u2019t intend to marry, no reason you need to disclose it.", "As a guy, I would not think this is a big deal. He assumed you rented.

I don\u2019t know the legalities if he were to contribute \u201crent\u201d which I would assume would go towards your mortgage payment. I certainly would not take \u201crent\u201d from him without a rental agreement. Things happen and not having a signed agreement could prove difficult later on.

They also should have had a conversation about cost of living and sharing of expenses before moving in. OP needs to sit down with her bf and they need to talk asap.", "They have been together for just over a year, and haven't been discussing marriage that she mentioned. So he's hardly a \"life partner\", it's a LTR yes, that's it so far.\n\nThat's still early enough in a relationship where I wouldn't be disclosing every single financial detail of my relationship. \n\nShould she mention her 401k, life insurance, stocks, or anything else that at this stage of their relationship he would in no way be a beneficiary of, should something happen to her?", "Why does he need to know he's not paying rent .", "Yeah, why does he need to know? He isn\u2019t paying rent so it shouldn\u2019t matter to him. Seems to me he\u2019s just insecure.", "To be clear, bf moved in \"about 3 weeks ago,\" they've been together for a year.", "He didn\u2019t ask or care? That\u2019s on him. NTA", "I dunno if it was cool. it\u2019s like, a basic conversation to have when you\u2019re moving in. TBH i would have been very uncomfortable accepting my partner\u2019s generosity like this and would have asked more questions. I can\u2019t imagine living for 12 months without revisiting the topic.", "There's actually a more sensible reason to not charge him rent. He would be building up equity in her home, they are still just bf/gf so there's no reason for him to pay towards her mortgage and her end up owing him down the line. Also if he pays her rent she would need to claim that income on her taxes. He's getting FREE RENT and you're acting like she's the villain? She should just end it with him because he's starting drama over nothing and that more than anything indicates that he's not to be trusted", "So, you would freely share all of your financial information with someone you have been dating for just over a year, without hesitation?.\n\nWhat if your worth millions, would you be so quick to share that information?\n\nWhat if she tells him, and he insists on being added to the deed?", "You're delusional", "I agree. OP wasn't ripping him off, wasn't charging him rent and making a profit off him, wasn't doing anything unethical. This knowledge literally does not impact him at all. But his reaction, and OP apologising profusely, does worry me. OP should make sure this doesn't create a precedent where he can get annoyed about anything and she has to apologise. Especially if he keeps holding this over OP, how she \"owes him because she's lied to him before\" or some such crap. By all means apologise OP and move on, but if he starts demanding you apologise for *anything* you do he doesn't like then dump him.", "That's good for you. Not everyone spills everything on the very first date. Some people protect their assets and keep certain things private. Just because you spilled it on the first date doesn't mean OP, or anyone else for that matter, has to.", "Wdy mean \"now\"-husband? What was he before", "How many other secrets? A garage across town full of DB Cooper's haul?\n\nI had a GF who bought a house, didn't tell me, her son destroyed the interior, so THEN she wants me to fix it.  What?", "Honestly, I wouldn't want a landlord-tenant relationship with my partner. The OP's bf has the opportunity to save the rent he's not paying into a rainy day fund so if they break up he can move out asap. Financial independence > the limited rights that come from tenancy. That's if he could even be a tenant--where I'm from, tenancy can't arise in a situation with a live-in landlord.", "I\u2019d guess that the boyfriend feels like he needs to be a \u201cprovider\u201d and her owning the house makes him very insecure", "It hurts his ego.", "You keep asking about all these other financial matters, instead of sticking to the subject at hand. Very curious.", "Sure, I agree with all of that. But we aren't talking about every little detail, it's about keeping in line with the relationship where it is, and in line with where it's headed.", "You say that as if he didn\u2019t literally ask her if he could pay 50%. She is the one that opted for him not to pay rent. I would find it bizarre if someone I was seeing for that long, had not found the time to tell me they own their home. It\u2019s a pretty significant detail that most people would be interested in knowing about their partner. It\u2019s a significant life accomplishment to own a home for most people, it\u2019s just weird to keep it to yourself. Like when was she going to tell him? It was only going to get worse the more time that passed. I know I would feel very weird about living in someone\u2019s home, and not knowing that they owned it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not the information that\u2019s a big deal, it\u2019s the trust issue. If someone couldn\u2019t share that with me, I would 100% question their commitment.", "Because he\u2019s living there\u2026 it\u2019s relevant, it\u2019s his home, if something goes wrong and knowing if there\u2019s a landlord or if you are responsible yourselves for maintenance and repair, and knowing too if he\u2019s financially obligated to her, will she start to resent it, is there a chance rent goes up, just for his own personal financial awareness and expectations. And if you\u2019re in a serious enough relationship to live together, which to me is pretty darn serious, you should have at least some awareness of each other\u2019s financial situation, and some level of honesty, which he directly asked about rent and OP was pretty evasive, not exactly lying but definitely misleading/obscuring the truth\u2026 not a great relationship moment.", "sounds like he wants to be fair and pay something and being told no rent sounds fishy?", "Fuck off.  \nIf someone invites me to live somewhere rent free I'm going to have questions. Why is it rent free?  \nIf it's a partner I would insist on paying my share of the rent. Them owning the property won't change my feelings of them but the fact they kept it such a secret would.  \nHonestly I'm mostly surprised people wouldn't ask questions about why their rent is free.", "When he asked about rent why didn't she just say she doesn't need him to pay her mortgage? It's just a strange thing to not bring up in the moment. If he is getting pissy for some ego bullshit then shame on him, but I think seeing her lack of communication as a red flag is not unwarranted.", "No, that\u2019s not how equity works at all. You don\u2019t get equity for paying towards a mortgage on a house that isn\u2019t even in your name. Even if they got married, and then got divorced, he would still not have a claim to her house in many justifications, as it\u2019s a pre-marital asset. (It wouldn\u2019t always work this way, but they would have to be married for a number of years for him to try and claim equity in the house)\n\nI\u2019m not saying there are no scenarios where he couldn\u2019t end up claiming equity in the house, but he would usually need to have been contributing to it for quite a few years and also would likely need to have proof he paid for other maintenance and improvements in addition to just \u201crent.\u201d And since his name is not on the deed, the only way he could ever even attempt to get equity, is by suing her.", "The topic isn\u2019t \u201call financial information\u201d. It\u2019s whether they own the house they live in. FYI, that isn\u2019t private information. It\u2019s in the public record, & in many places, it\u2019s easily available online on the County property tax website. Also on that website is the value of that property, in the opinion of the local property tax assessor, and whether the owner pays their property taxes on time.", "This isn\u2019t about showing him the bank accounts or offering to put his name on all the paperwork. It\u2019s about the basic courtesy of not hiding the fact that OP became his unofficial landlady. He\u2019s moved in to what he thought was a rental home and sincerely offered to contribute financially, not wanting to feel like he was taking advantage of OP inviting him and OP kept him in the dark as long as she could and made him feel like she never trusted him not to be a manipulative AH if he knew she had property.\n\nIt\u2019s not like she needs to present him with an itemized list of her assets, real estate or otherwise, but the guy lives in the house!", "this isn't a first date thing, OP has bene dating this guy for over a year and has kept this a secret, what else is she hiding form him? I'd be very concerned as the boyfriend simply for the reason of trust.", "Probably boyfriend first", "On our first date, he wasn\u2019t my husband. Now he is.", "Not her husband. Keep up.", "You kind of need a landlord tenant relationship in one sense. \n\nImagine it\u2019s her home. So she has the final say of absolutely everything. \n\nWhen push comes to shove she is the boss. \n\nPaying some rent gives him rights to those decisions as an equal rather than as a nothing. \n\nLiving in someone else\u2019s home is hard. \n\nPersonally, I would never again move someone into my house. I would rent or buy another place together", "In that case she's better off without him anyway", "So your saying their aren't predatory people out there who would take advantage of a situation if possible.\n\nOP stated, they just moved in together, dating over a year. \n\nFrom personal experience when you move in together is when you see the real person. And sometimes it's not what you were expecting.\n\nMy point was, why is it such a big deal.\n\nFamily tells her not to discuss that kind of information, and instead of having a civil conversation about why she didn't share the information, he gets all butthurt and telling her \"how can he trust her\".\n\nSERIOUSLY? he didn't even get the explanation as to why she didn't tell him, just jumped her shit and telling her how bad of a person she was\n\nOVER OWNING A HOUSE AND NOT TELLING THEM IMMEDIATELY\n\nIf there is a hill to die on, that's a stupid one", "This.  I don't think she's necessarily T A for not disclosing her homeowner status, it's more that I find it really effing weird that it never once came up in the year+ they've been dating, let alone after he moved in.  It's not top secret financial information.  \n\nI'm more confused than anything else.", "She's a woman, who was acting to protect her interests in the manner that was instilled in her by her own family.\n\nAnd he was contributing, splitting the cost of utilities. So basically deal of the century.\n\nShould she have told him, that's her business and choice.\n\nHIS reaction I think is overblown.\n\nExample: I move in with my girlfriend, she asks me to chip in XX amount for utilities, I find out later on she actually owns the house. \n\nOk, fine.... is it a HUGE deal? No, do I ask her why she didn't tell me, sure. \n\nDo I make it out to be all about my butthurt feelings? \n\nNO, we have a civil conversation, and she eventually explains her reasoning.\n\nTwo sides to a coin. is it really THAT big of a deal that people don't share every minute detail of their lives, especially when conditioned at an early age to not say such things?", "I uh\u2026wasn\u2019t agreeing that this was a first date thing. I\u2019m just replying to the poster above, that just because they spilled the info on the first date, that not everyone else has to", "That isn't what I said at all. I said that you  keep diverting from the actual subject of OP's question, which is whether OP was an AH for misleading their lover about the fact they owned their home.  A person who is predatory won't need OP to tell them whether they owned their house or not. That information is trivially available to anyone who wants to know because it's in the public record.  If you reread OP's post, the boyfriend didn't say that OP was a bad person. He merely spoke of how that deceit made him feel. How he feels about something is up to him.", "No, she isn't, nor should she have apologized.\n\nA simple 5 minute civil conversation started by her boyfriend asking, \"Hey, so I heard you and your dad discussing financials about this place. Can you please explain to me why you didn't mention you owned this place when I moved in?\"\n\nSaying that and listening to her response would have resulted in this whole post never happening. Instead we have the OP questioning if she did something wrong due to the BF's overreaction and not handling the situation in a mature manner.\n\nIf anything, he should have apologized for the way he treated her."]}
