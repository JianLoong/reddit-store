If you owned the house and didn't have a mortgage, but charged him rent- that would be AH territory.\n\nI can see why he wants to know and feels like you should have mentioned it.

I have a feeling you didn't tell him because you didn't want him to feel that you have your life more together than he does.  And his response to finding out seems to be him actually feeling a bit jealous or insecure about the fact that you own your place and he's still renting.  Yes, you neglected to tell him, but it's not like you were having an affair or something.  You should be very proud of what you've achieved in owning your own home at your age!  Now that he knows and you've seen his response, you should probably charge him the same rent you charged your other room-mate, to be fair.  He's a grown man, right?

He has the right, as a financially contributing resident, to know just how the bills/rent are being paid.\n\nYOU suck for the deflection. Again, he has a right to this information.\n\nBut what sticks out to me and why I say ESH because NEITHER OF YOU BROUGHT ANYTHING UP UNTIL THAT MOMENT. Whether one gets invited to live with someone as simple roommates, or two or more people decide to live together, romantically or not, the financial responsibilities MUST BE DISCUSSED. It should be talked about if not first, then as soon as possible. How do you live with someone and not figure out what the financial system of the household will be? Will you have a system of paying for everything as an even 50/50 split? Will certain bills be paid by one and the rest paid by the other? (for instance, in my house, my husband handles rent and phone bills. I handle groceries, electric, water, and gas.) Does one of you get paid weekly and the other bi-weekly so they may have to take the bill that's due the week you don't get paid and you catch the next one. All sorts of things. I just don't understand how this never came up once between the two of you before move-in day. So, ESH", "YTA and this is just a really weird thing to lie about.

It needs to be a both sharing situation or it puts one partner in an uncomfortable position of not knowing. \n\nMoving in is typically when people begin talking about real numbers though, so it\u2019s slightly odd neither of you felt comfortable saying what financial position you\u2019re in.

I certainly would not take \u201crent\u201d from him without a rental agreement. Things happen and not having a signed agreement could prove difficult later on.

However, I don't think you're a malicious person or an asshole, I think you sound sweet and maybe a little naive. If this is a serious partner that you are now living with you should absolutely discuss finances! Maybe your parents meant that it's bad etiquette to randomly ask someone you've just met, \"say how much money do you make?\" But with a \\*life partner\\* it is actually crucial to discuss finances! Financial issues are a top reason for couples to separate or divorce. Unfortunate as it may be, money is a major issue in our society and everything from your credit score to your salary to your personal thoughts around spending habits should be openly discussed. If you were to marry this person, or anyone, they are a myriad of money related discussions that would potentially need to happen. Such as whether to have a joint account, how you'd like to grow your savings (who will contribute, how much, how often, etc), if one partner can't work or decides to stay home with children, can the other partner support them? Just things like household budgets, etc. Surely at some point you'd have to know how much the other makes at least??

I think you should be honest about it. Not saying ask how much he makes, that\u2019s something he should volunteer. But it is SO important to keep communication open not just about personal stuff but financially too. I get you were perhaps trying to protect him, not put pressure of a mortgage on him. But I think he would feel better contributing. \nAgain I don\u2019t think YTA, I just think perhaps you need to talk with your partner about things to make sure you don\u2019t keep secrets like this.

I hope however it works out makes you happy. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA he should have asked if there was a lease to update when he moved in, and should have found out that way. When moving in, he should have asked \u201cif there\u2019s an emergency, what is our landlord\u2019s contact info\u201d and should have found out that way. It\u2019s not OPs fault he wasn\u2019t thorough.", "NTA. What does he care? He had a place to live, doesn\u2019t he? He sounds jealous and petty though. May not have been a good idea to move him in.", "NTA. Why would it even matter? Unless it's a big issue that he can't use it to control you in some weird way?", "NTA. Tell him that you didn\u2019t feel comfortable yet disclosing this last bit of information. Tell him that since he was so upset about it, that you\u2019d be happy to make it a formal arrangement and present him with a lease (make sure it\u2019s month to month because you may find out that this might be what gives you insight to his character). \n\nI let my then boyfriend (now husband) move in with me and he had no clue I owned my house. I charged him rent (enough for half utilities). He didn\u2019t think anything about it. After we were married, my husband invested in a remodel and we sold the house and bought one together. \n\nIf your boyfriend cannot understand then it\u2019s time to move passed this guy because his insecurities will become more of an issue later.", "I think most of the people who comment on these subs fit into one of the following categories:\n\n1) Teenage girls who obviously don't know shit. \n2) Women in horrible relationships that blame men for all their problems when in reality both parties are super toxic. \n3) single women in their forties bitter about men because they are shitty people and without the massive power imbalance they enjoyed in their 20s any half decent single man doesn't give them the time of day.", "My God, projecting much? Where was this said?", "You can tell a lot of these people have never been in a successful relationship. Trust is the most important aspect of any relationship. After reading the update I don't think op did it due to a lack of trust but moreso because she's gotten into her own head about financial stuff. Doesn't mean she didn't break his trust by essentially lying to him though.", "An adult would have asked literally ANY questions about his rent free living situation.", "That's a fair point but owning your own house outright at the end of the mortgage is advantageous in so many ways:\n\n* You can never be evicted and be made homeless (ie: the inherent value of housing). Just the lack of stress from this alone!\n* If you retire, you are in a much better financial situation ... often retiree welfare and/or a modest retirement fund can be enough to live comfortably IF you own your own home.\n* You can then purchase another house, have renters pay your mortgage, and build even more wealth while not even working... also known as \"the boomer special\" or \"why wealth inequality is getting worse\"", "You can still be evicted by the bank for not paying your mortgage during the ~30 years it takes to pay it off. \n\n\nYou can also lose the home if you don't pay your property taxes.", "I think you have a lot of misconceptions around home ownership. I bought a condo around 3 years ago. I pay approximately $800 a month towards the mortgage, plus another $300 a month for HOA fees. Of that, only about $200/month goes towards the actual principal of the house (aka 'back in my pocket') the rest is all going towards taxes, interest, etc.  Financially, I may as well be in an apartment that costs $900/month, I would see the same amount of savings, and any problems that arise with the property would be someone else's problem to pay for. If at any time I stop paying towards the mortgage, my bank will evict me. They are essentially the landlord.  You can only purchase another home if you have enough cash lying around for a down-payment on another house (20% of the full value of the house), and if the mortgage company feels your income is sufficient to cover both mortgages (more often then not, they won't consider the option of renting out the first place as reliable income, so I wouldn't bank on that).", "Given that the truth did not come out, and since OP says she\u2019s secretive around her finances I think your second suggestion is the most likely outcome. Especially since he was annoyed when he finally heard the truth. \n\nThis whole post just seems to be an attempt to spin her version of events with key info left out. It\u2019s a YTA.", "In my country some banks take as little as 5% deposit on a home loan (which is both good and bad).\n\nWe don't have HOAs, or at least they're not called that and they usually lack the insanity of American HOAs. Some properties have strata or body corps, which is similar but is almost exclusively for units - what you guys call apartments - and similar mid to high density housing. There are also gated communities with HOA type arrangements but they're very rare.\n\n--------------\n\nEven still *I would trade places with you in an instant*\n\nYou are way way way better off than a renter. Especially once you pay the condo off.\n\nBut hey if you disagree - feel free to sign over your condo to me!", "It seems like the people who have fucked up finances often have all these financial secrets. Or at the least aren\u2019t open about their finances.", "Control issues. Deceived him? What a jerk.", "Because when he asked about rent she didn't tell him that she owned the home.  So now it looks like a dirty little secret she was hiding from him.  There's no reason she shift have said that she owned it so rent isn't an issue.  \nPlus now she is also his landlord. So there's a while other issue there", "\u2026because 1) it\u2019s generally good to know what kind of living situation you are entering 2) it is very weird for your partner of over a year to be hiding the fact that they own their home from you, and it would make me question why they feel the need to hide such basic things from me.\n\nI mean when you start living together, regardless of time together, these things really need to be discussed openly.", "They haven\u2019t discussed their wages either so it\u2019s not like she was keeping secrets. Maybe he\u2019s embarrassed that he isn\u2019t on the same level as she financially and reacted by turning it back on her. Whatever the case, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s trying to be deceitful.", "Switch the genders around and a woman might feel the exact same way."]}
