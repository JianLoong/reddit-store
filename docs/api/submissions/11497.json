YTA.", "Honestly, I think ESH. He should have asked whatever questions he wanted to about the house *before* agreeing to move in. If he assumed you were renting, why not ask how long your lease was and what rules there were and whatnot so he could plan ahead and make an informed decision? But you also should have been upfront about what kind of situation he was getting into. Why wouldn't you think to inform him of the details of his living situation?

I mean keeping secrets in general is bad for relationships but this has an added layer of being really odd. From his perspective, you must have some sort of motivation for not telling him, which would naturally cause trust issues.\n\nI don't think you're necessarily an asshole but are you really surprised that he's confused and having doubts?", "You would be an asshole if you would have charged him rent but you did not.

He seems like he wants to have a solid, respectful relationship with you. His asking (unprompted!) how he could contribute to the rent was really cool of him, and that probably should have been the time to tell him the truth (before he moved in would have been better).

You should have told him.", "NTA- A year long relationship does not mean he needs to know upfront about your finances or assets.  If you owned the house and didn't have a mortgage, but charged him rent- that would be AH territory.\n\nI can see why he wants to know and feels like you should have mentioned it.  But basically, he is getting a great deal just splitting utilities. And you are smart not to let him contribute to the house payment itself.", "NTA.  He takes himself way too seriously over YOUR assets.  Congratulations on being a homeowner!  So proud of you and I don't even know you!!!!", "NTA.  I have a feeling you didn't tell him because you didn't want him to feel that you have your life more together than he does.  And his response to finding out seems to be him actually feeling a bit jealous or insecure about the fact that you own your place and he's still renting.  Yes, you neglected to tell him, but it's not like you were having an affair or something.  You should be very proud of what you've achieved in owning your own home at your age!  Now that he knows and you've seen his response, you should probably charge him the same rent you charged your other room-mate, to be fair.  He's a grown man, right?  He needs to pay some rent.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t need that information and it changes nothing for him.", "YTA. If you are in a committed relationship, both of you should know everything about each other. There shouldn't be any secrets.

You'll sleep better at night", "NAH\nI get it, especially if you\u2019re still paying the mortgage. If you told him, and he wanted to help pay the mortgage, that potentially forces the relationship into a more serious situation way too fast.

You can\u2019t expect people to trust you if you mislead them about matters they consider to be important. The first time makes people wonder what other secrets you\u2019re keeping & what else you\u2019re misleading them about.

Not pay his share of the living expenses? \n\nI do not understand why people have joint bank accounts. 50/50. its not a debate. my (now ex) \"husband\", (he cheated), never knew exactly what i earned, or owned, or anything about my financial situation. None of his, or anyone else's, business. \n\nSorry if i seem bitter, but life has taught me a thing or two. A boyfriend definitely does not need to be privy to this information.", "NTA.  But I have a sincere warning from experience in my background.  You need some quick legal advice if you want to continue this.

ESH and here's why:\n\nHE sucks because he didn't press for details when you deflected. He has the right, as a financially contributing resident, to know just how the bills/rent are being paid.\n\nYOU suck for the deflection. Again, he has a right to this information.\n\nBut what sticks out to me and why I say ESH because NEITHER OF YOU BROUGHT ANYTHING UP UNTIL THAT MOMENT. Whether one gets invited to live with someone as simple roommates, or two or more people decide to live together, romantically or not, the financial responsibilities MUST BE DISCUSSED. It should be talked about if not first, then as soon as possible. How do you live with someone and not figure out what the financial system of the household will be? Will you have a system of paying for everything as an even 50/50 split? Will certain bills be paid by one and the rest paid by the other? (for instance, in my house, my husband handles rent and phone bills. I handle groceries, electric, water, and gas.) Does one of you get paid weekly and the other bi-weekly so they may have to take the bill that's due the week you don't get paid and you catch the next one. All sorts of things. I just don't understand how this never came up once between the two of you before move-in day. So, ESH", "YTA and this is just a really weird thing to lie about.

Once you told him no rent he should have known.", "NTA. Moving in doesn\u2019t automatically entitle anyone to your financial information. If you\u2019re not at a stage to know each other\u2019s salary, then you\u2019re not ready to discuss assets. If he wants to know your financial situation, then he should be disclosing his as well. It needs to be a both sharing situation or it puts one partner in an uncomfortable position of not knowing. \n\nMoving in is typically when people begin talking about real numbers though, so it\u2019s slightly odd neither of you felt comfortable saying what financial position you\u2019re in. The number one stated cause of divorce in the US is financial, so it\u2019s pretty important for people to be open about that with someone they intend to marry. But if you don\u2019t intend to marry, no reason you need to disclose it.", "As a guy, I would not think this is a big deal. He assumed you rented.

I don\u2019t know the legalities if he were to contribute \u201crent\u201d which I would assume would go towards your mortgage payment. I certainly would not take \u201crent\u201d from him without a rental agreement. Things happen and not having a signed agreement could prove difficult later on.

They also should have had a conversation about cost of living and sharing of expenses before moving in. OP needs to sit down with her bf and they need to talk asap.", "They have been together for just over a year, and haven't been discussing marriage that she mentioned. So he's hardly a \"life partner\", it's a LTR yes, that's it so far.\n\nThat's still early enough in a relationship where I wouldn't be disclosing every single financial detail of my relationship. \n\nShould she mention her 401k, life insurance, stocks, or anything else that at this stage of their relationship he would in no way be a beneficiary of, should something happen to her?", "Why does he need to know he's not paying rent .", "Yeah, why does he need to know? He isn\u2019t paying rent so it shouldn\u2019t matter to him. Seems to me he\u2019s just insecure.", "To be clear, bf moved in \"about 3 weeks ago,\" they've been together for a year.", "He didn\u2019t ask or care? That\u2019s on him. NTA", "I dunno if it was cool. I mean, it's not so much \"offering to contribute\" as \"hey, how much is rent and is 50:50 fair?\". Like, that's not cool, that's rudimentary.\n\nTBH i would have been very uncomfortable accepting my partner\u2019s generosity like this and would have asked more questions, so can't see myself ending up in this situation. I can\u2019t imagine ~~living for 12 months without revisiting the topic~~. getting my knickers in a knot because my partner was being cautious in disclosing the legal structure of the tenancy when they're letting me live there for FREE and it's only three weeks in. He presumed, then gets pissy because he was wrong? \n\nEDIT: my reading comprehension skills are off. He's only lived there for 3 weeks. Relationship is 12 months old.", "There's actually a more sensible reason to not charge him rent. He would be building up equity in her home, they are still just bf/gf so there's no reason for him to pay towards her mortgage and her end up owing him down the line. Also if he pays her rent she would need to claim that income on her taxes. He's getting FREE RENT and you're acting like she's the villain? She should just end it with him because he's starting drama over nothing and that more than anything indicates that he's not to be trusted", "So, you would freely share all of your financial information with someone you have been dating for just over a year, without hesitation?.\n\nWhat if your worth millions, would you be so quick to share that information?\n\nWhat if she tells him, and he insists on being added to the deed?", "You're delusional", "I agree. OP wasn't ripping him off, wasn't charging him rent and making a profit off him, wasn't doing anything unethical. This knowledge literally does not impact him at all. But his reaction, and OP apologising profusely, does worry me. OP should make sure this doesn't create a precedent where he can get annoyed about anything and she has to apologise. Especially if he keeps holding this over OP, how she \"owes him because she's lied to him before\" or some such crap. By all means apologise OP and move on, but if he starts demanding you apologise for *anything* you do he doesn't like then dump him.", "That's good for you. Not everyone spills everything on the very first date. Some people protect their assets and keep certain things private. Just because you spilled it on the first date doesn't mean OP, or anyone else for that matter, has to.", "Wdy mean \"now\"-husband? What was he before", "How many other secrets? A garage across town full of DB Cooper's haul?\n\nI had a GF who bought a house, didn't tell me, her son destroyed the interior, so THEN she wants me to fix it.  What?", "Honestly, I wouldn't want a landlord-tenant relationship with my partner. The OP's bf has the opportunity to save the rent he's not paying into a rainy day fund so if they break up he can move out asap. Financial independence > the limited rights that come from tenancy. That's if he could even be a tenant--where I'm from, tenancy can't arise in a situation with a live-in landlord.", "I\u2019d guess that the boyfriend feels like he needs to be a \u201cprovider\u201d and her owning the house makes him very insecure", "It hurts his ego.", "You keep asking about all these other financial matters, instead of sticking to the subject at hand. Very curious.", "Sure, I agree with all of that. But we aren't talking about every little detail, it's about keeping in line with the relationship where it is, and in line with where it's headed.", "You say that as if he didn\u2019t literally ask her if he could pay 50%. She is the one that opted for him not to pay rent. I would find it bizarre if someone I was seeing for that long, had not found the time to tell me they own their home. It\u2019s a pretty significant detail that most people would be interested in knowing about their partner. It\u2019s a significant life accomplishment to own a home for most people, it\u2019s just weird to keep it to yourself. Like when was she going to tell him? It was only going to get worse the more time that passed. I know I would feel very weird about living in someone\u2019s home, and not knowing that they owned it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not the information that\u2019s a big deal, it\u2019s the trust issue. If someone couldn\u2019t share that with me, I would 100% question their commitment.", "Because he\u2019s living there\u2026 it\u2019s relevant, it\u2019s his home, if something goes wrong and knowing if there\u2019s a landlord or if you are responsible yourselves for maintenance and repair, and knowing too if he\u2019s financially obligated to her, will she start to resent it, is there a chance rent goes up, just for his own personal financial awareness and expectations. And if you\u2019re in a serious enough relationship to live together, which to me is pretty darn serious, you should have at least some awareness of each other\u2019s financial situation, and some level of honesty, which he directly asked about rent and OP was pretty evasive, not exactly lying but definitely misleading/obscuring the truth\u2026 not a great relationship moment.", "sounds like he wants to be fair and pay something and being told no rent sounds fishy?", "Fuck off.  \nIf someone invites me to live somewhere rent free I'm going to have questions. Why is it rent free?  \nIf it's a partner I would insist on paying my share of the rent. Them owning the property won't change my feelings of them but the fact they kept it such a secret would.  \nHonestly I'm mostly surprised people wouldn't ask questions about why their rent is free.", "When he asked about rent why didn't she just say she doesn't need him to pay her mortgage? It's just a strange thing to not bring up in the moment. If he is getting pissy for some ego bullshit then shame on him, but I think seeing her lack of communication as a red flag is not unwarranted.", "No, that\u2019s not how equity works at all. You don\u2019t get equity for paying towards a mortgage on a house that isn\u2019t even in your name. Even if they got married, and then got divorced, he would still not have a claim to her house in many justifications, as it\u2019s a pre-marital asset. (It wouldn\u2019t always work this way, but they would have to be married for a number of years for him to try and claim equity in the house)\n\nI\u2019m not saying there are no scenarios where he couldn\u2019t end up claiming equity in the house, but he would usually need to have been contributing to it for quite a few years and also would likely need to have proof he paid for other maintenance and improvements in addition to just \u201crent.\u201d And since his name is not on the deed, the only way he could ever even attempt to get equity, is by suing her.", "The topic isn\u2019t \u201call financial information\u201d.

Also on that website is the value of that property, in the opinion of the local property tax assessor, and whether the owner pays their property taxes on time.", "This isn\u2019t about showing him the bank accounts or offering to put his name on all the paperwork. It\u2019s about the basic courtesy of not hiding the fact that OP became his unofficial landlady. He\u2019s moved in to what he thought was a rental home and sincerely offered to contribute financially, not wanting to feel like he was taking advantage of OP inviting him and OP kept him in the dark as long as she could and made him feel like she never trusted him not to be a manipulative AH if he knew she had property.\n\nIt\u2019s not like she needs to present him with an itemized list of her assets, real estate or otherwise, but the guy lives in the house!", "this isn't a first date thing, OP has been dating this guy for over a year and has kept this a secret, what else is she hiding from him? I'd be very concerned as the boyfriend simply for the reason of trust.", "Probably boyfriend first", "On our first date, he wasn\u2019t my husband. Now he is.", "Not her husband. Keep up.", "You kind of need a landlord tenant relationship in one sense. \n\nImagine it\u2019s her home. So she has the final say of absolutely everything. \n\nWhen push comes to shove she is the boss. \n\nPaying some rent gives him rights to those decisions as an equal rather than as a nothing. \n\nLiving in someone else\u2019s home is hard. \n\nPersonally, I would never again move someone into my house.

I don't think she's necessarily T A for not disclosing her homeowner status, it's more that I find it really effing weird that it never once came up in the year+ they've been dating, let alone after he moved in.

No, do I ask her why she didn't tell me, sure. \n\nDo I make it out to be all about my butthurt feelings? \n\nNO, we have a civil conversation, and she eventually explains her reasoning.\n\nTwo sides to a coin. is it really THAT big of a deal that people don't share every minute detail of their lives, especially when conditioned at an early age to not say such things?", "I uh\u2026wasn\u2019t agreeing that this was a first date thing.

I said that you  keep diverting from the actual subject of OP's question, which is whether OP was an AH for misleading their lover about the fact they owned their home.  A person who is predatory won't need OP to tell them whether they owned their house or not. That information is trivially available to anyone who wants to know because it's in the public record.  If you reread OP's post, the boyfriend didn't say that OP was a bad person. He merely spoke of how that deceit made him feel. How he feels about something is up to him.", "No, she isn't, nor should she have apologized.\n\nA simple 5 minute civil conversation started by her boyfriend asking, \"Hey, so I heard you and your dad discussing financials about this place. Can you please explain to me why you didn't mention you owned this place when I moved in?\"\n\nSaying that and listening to her response would have resulted in this whole post never happening. Instead we have the OP questioning if she did something wrong due to the BF's overreaction and not handling the situation in a mature manner.\n\nIf anything, he should have apologized for the way he treated her.", "you're his landlord now and have power over him he didn't consent to.", "> He agreed and he moved in about 3 weeks ago, the issue began when he started to ask how much his half of the rent was, I responded and said rent wasn\u2019t an issue and that it\u2019s just easier for me to continue with how it was before he moved in\n\nThis is lying by omission. You might think you did nothing wrong but this was some serious verbal gymnastics to hide the truth from him without technically lying. YTA\n\nI honestly think I\u2019d break up with a partner if they did this to me. Secrets and lies are one of the few things I cannot tolerate in a relationship. I expect a baseline level of trust that would require my partner disclose the basic details of our living situation before we moved in together - honestly any housemate has a right to understand how the space is owned, the details of contact, etc. \n\nThe fact that you didn\u2019t correct his obvious misconception with it came up in conversation really puts it over the edge for me \u2026 I don\u2019t think I could trust a partner who was willing to twist their language to leave me confused for no apparent reason. How do you move on with a normal relationship after that?", "YTA. I mean you\u2019re dating over a year and you don\u2019t tell him you own the house. That\u2019s so weird to me. And don\u2019t give the \u201cI didn\u2019t want to flex\u201d bs. He\u2019s your partner, you should share things with him. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going around bragging to strangers. Are you sure you are ready for a relationship?", "YTA. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re dating him because you see a future with him, correct? Why would you not share this kind of information from the get-go? It just seems silly to keep something like that hidden and it wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cflex\u201d if you\u2019re telling your partner that you own your home. It becomes a \u201cflex\u201d when you make daily posts about being a homeowner and telling everyone within earshot that you own your own home. If you\u2019re not doing that, then you have nothing to worry about. \n\nIt\u2019s not right to keep things from your partner. No matter what it may be. And while this was clearly an innocent issue, you still should have just told him when he asked about rent instead of being weird about it.", "eh, I'm torn but I think this is a NAH situation after reading your edit. You specifically withheld information which was a weird thing to do. This wasn't an \"it just never came up...\" situation, you were hiding the information and I think he has a right to be upset since this is his home now and you're his partner. However, I don't think you're a malicious person or an asshole, I think you sound sweet and maybe a little naive. If this is a serious partner that you are now living with you should absolutely discuss finances! Maybe your parents meant that it's bad etiquette to randomly ask someone you've just met, \"say how much money do you make?\" But with a \\*life partner\\* it is actually crucial to discuss finances! Financial issues are a top reason for couples to separate or divorce. Unfortunate as it may be, money is a major issue in our society and everything from your credit score to your salary to your personal thoughts around spending habits should be openly discussed. If you were to marry this person, or anyone, they are a myriad of money related discussions that would potentially need to happen. Such as whether to have a joint account, how you'd like to grow your savings (who will contribute, how much, how often, etc), if one partner can't work or decides to stay home with children, can the other partner support them? Just things like household budgets, etc. Surely at some point you'd have to know how much the other makes at least?? I mean maybe you already have thought of this and just were keeping the finances more casual for now? But if these are things you haven't thought about, and you are serious about starting a life with your partner, talking to a financial planner or someone like that might be a good idea.", "You are N T A for not telling him when it wasn't relevant.

Kinda it's just really odd to be with someone for over a year and never mention you own the house you live in. Like how'd that never come up in conversation.", "YTA you lied and it\u2019s controlling", "Seems weird to me to purposely not say something about owning the house that you both live in. Just seems like, if you are going to withhold that information, why and what else are you withholding?", "Yta. Of course that\u2019s a big deal. And why bother asking your friends? It\u2019s how your bf feels about it that\u2019s important.", "YTA. It's a weird thing to not tell him. It's going to make him think you're hiding other things. I would think it's super sketchy. But I'm stuck on him not asking about the rent cost before he moved in? My first question to a living space is \"how much is it?\" so  it's hard for me to believe someone who was concerned about rent prices moving in somewhere blindly.", "With the edit, it feels sort of like a mute point to make any sort of new judgement since talks have been had and all is good, so I will only ask for INFO that I am sure a lot of us would like to know...\n\nAs a younger aged homeowner, what are some of your tips from what you experienced searching for/buying your house?", "I\u2019m learning toward YTA. I\u2019m worried about y\u2019all\u2019s communication. Why on earth was his ok moving and not discussing rent until after the fact?? This should have been discussed ahead of time so he could make an informed decision. But when he asked about how much to contribute to rent? That was the moment you should have been honest. It makes no sense to keep it from him if you\u2019re taking the next step and living together.  It\u2019s not a flex when you\u2019re established as a couple. I totally get not throwing that out when you first start dating.", "I\u2019m\u2026on the fence about this. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re necessarily TA because I think you were taught wrong about keeping finances to yourself. You can only go by what you learned growing up. \nI think you should absolutely have told him though because it was bound to come up. \nMy biggest thing though is, and this is my own thought, finances are the thing that impacts so many couples and can cause them to split. I think you should be honest about it. Not saying ask how much he makes, that\u2019s something he should volunteer. But it is SO important to keep communication open not just about personal stuff but financially too. I get you were perhaps trying to protect him, not put pressure of a mortgage on him. But I think he would feel better contributing. \nAgain I don\u2019t think YTA, I just think perhaps you need to talk with your partner about things to make sure you don\u2019t keep secrets like this. A relationship is like a highway, endlessly moving in both directions until a traffic jam happens and that\u2019s when issues happen. Keep communication open and no traffic jam. :) all the best.", "How do you date someone a year and not tell them you own your home?", "NAH. I see when you are taught finances \u2018shouldn\u2019t be discussed\u2019, so you took that literally. I don\u2019t think this should apply to people moving in together.

The amount of detail on what that means can vary, but I do understand him feeling wrong footed now that he overheard this conversation.\n\nYou owning the house is not a minor detail. It\u2019s got a big impact on the situation. What if you stayed together and wanted to move after a few years, to a house you buy together?\nYou need to discuss how to manage those finances.\n\nI don\u2019t get the comments on the BF wanting to be a provider, or claiming ownership. Geez, it sounds like projection or just fixation on negatives. Not every guy is an abusive a-hole.", "Maybe it's reaching too much, but maybe he blew up the way he did bc he feels emasculated?

Trust is the foundation.", "I\u2019d feel more insecure if I was living rent free while my partner was paying rent. He had no problem with free. He\u2019s a ding dong", "WTF. Where does this even come from. He most likely just feels weird. She hid it from him and is worried she could just be hiding other things. You prob should stop just straight up speculating.", "Groan", "Ofc ur sexist ass would disagree lol", "This! In a relationship you typically don\u2019t communicate on a need to know basis\u2026\n\nAnd I get that she wasn\u2019t mentioning it before he moved in but from the moment they discussed a topic where it\u2019s relevant (his rent) it\u2019s strange she doesn\u2019t mention it.", "Lol. Why didn\u2019t he pry info out of her she was weirdly trying to hide?", "I AM SO ANGRY ILL POST IN ALL CAPS TOO AS NOW MY YELLING HAS AUTHORITY!", "[removed]", "He has only lived there 3 weeks.", "NTA-\nThis is how you get underpaid by your boss, underpaid by your industry, and ripped off when you buy things: discussing finances with other people around you is fantastic. But even if you don't think discussing finances with friends and coworkers is something you would do, you NEED to talk finances with your partner,", ">she is definitely NTA\n\nHow is she not the ah for lying by omission and becoming his landlord without his knowledge and how tf is he the ah for being upset over that.", "Nah man, I'd definitely be more insecure about living with my landlord with no tenant rights than living with my partner rent-free, lol.", "You are right,I was wrong.she bought the house and has to pay mortgage but she is not charging him rent . She is a sweet person .she didn't made him pay rent without telling him it is her property which would make her in the wrong . He is also only living for 3 weeks while dating for 1 year. only problem would not knowing each other salary and debt after dating this long. Finances can easily break a relationship.not in depth knowledge is necessary of each other finance but not knowing anything is weird.", "You're saying that when your partner is a bit cagey about something, the right thing to do is to pry and push the issue and demand an answer? He clearly asked follow up questions, and got weird non responsive answers, and so he then dropped it because it was clear she didn't want to discuss it.", "Nope, he's upset cuz she hid it.", "He literally asked her these questions and she said not to worry. It's in the post lol", "True, but they've been together for over a year. That's kind of a big thing to keep hidden.  Not mentioning you occasionally foster pets for a week at a time? Should probably come up before they move in, but okay. Not mentioning that you have a child? Big deal. Not mentioning that you have a $200 stamp collection? Okay. Not mentioning that you own a house before they move in? Big deal.", "She is not his landlord.  He is not paying rent.  What the hell?", "Lololol free rent. The poor man, however will he cope?", "They're purposefully ignoring it cuz 'men bad, women good' yk.", "She wants the morgage and title to be in her name. Nothing wrong with that. But she should have disclosed that before he moved in, so he would understand the power dynamics.", "This is the oddest part of this post.  He asked about the situation and her response was vague, this is why he got annoyed when he found out the truth. I\u2019d be surprised if he hadn\u2019t asked a follow up when she gave him that wishy-washy response, but OP hasn\u2019t stated what he said so probably this is an ESH, if he didn\u2019t follow up - but she goes on to say her parents taught her to be secretive about money so it\u2019s more likely to be YTA. \n\nIf you\u2019re deciding to live together have clearer communication, including what the financial picture is.", "[removed]", "\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fHe's paying half the of the utilities and living in her house with no lease. Basically, a tenant with very few, if any, tenant rights.", "Yup, I wonder how he'll cope after learning that gf can kick him out whenever she wants to and he'll able to do nothing. I also wonder what he'll do after learning that his gf has no qualms hiding smth so important. I hope he sees OP's red flags", "He literally fucking did ask? wtf are u high on?", "Oh of course. I just want them to admit it lol", "He's paying half the utilities because he's using them.  There's no landlord here.  You have to rent out property to be a landlord.\n\nIf he would rather have tenants rights, which is fine, then hell need to go find a landlord.", "He asked what he needs to pay AFTER MOVING IN what are YOU high on?", "An impossible task u have undertaken, I see.", "Does that matter? She still fucking lied goddamnit.", "I bet you believe old people deserve to be scammed and think fraud Is the fault of those defrauded for not being smart enough", "Wow, how exactly is this fraud? How can you compare the fact that op didn't allow her bf to pay rent in her house  basically giving him an almost free ride with fraud to the elderly?!  Mental gymnastics much?\n\n\n( I for one believe in being open with you so but I get she has been told by her family to not discuss this and the fact bf didn't ask anything about the payment and is being evicted as shows me he isn't financially responsible so I would hesitate maybe too in this case) \n\n\nI would consider the op an Ah if she asked him for rent while owning the apartment without disclosure, then yes. As is, bf was fine he didn't bother to ask any more questions after the initial how much is rent AFTER moving in so he wasn't that interested either. \n\nHad she actually lied and refused to tell him if he insisted asking about rent and conditions  after the initial question , again I would say she's the Ah."]}
