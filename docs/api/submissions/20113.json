The kid still doesn't go to school so she's always there  waiting for me to get home...\n\nA couple of days ago I was really tired from a hectic day.

After a while she was taken home by her mother. Later I have ordered some food and opened my door to collect it, and there, the damn kid was again asking if she could play with the cat again. I got really vexed at this point and lied to her that  I have decided to give the cat away to a friend. Now the kid is sad and depressed and has stopped eating and that is making me feel guilty.

If you did and they did nothing, then that's another story. Lying is not going to end well. If the child wants to interact with someone else's pet, she needs to learn to be mindful and respectful of both the animal and the owner. Neither of those things has been happening.", "While I can sympathize with you because you shouldn't have to accommodate your neighbor's kid in this way, you went about it the wrong way.\n\nLying and saying you gave the cat away was mean.

I thought it was a good idea to get the dog socialized around kids. Until it wasn't a good idea. I let the kids know that we could no longer let them play with the dogs.

Maybe you should've told her \"no\" but so what if you didn't? It's also not your problem if she's depressed. Her parents were just passive aggressively using you as a free babysitter and that's unacceptable bullshit.", "Yeah, it\u2019s super weird.

This is their problem, not yours.", "NTA not your responsibility but neither is the suggestion.

A 3-4yo barely has a concept of car safety. If she was 6/7, it would still be odd, but feel less dangerous. I wouldn\u2019t jump straight to a CPS call without discussing the issue with the parents first (maybe even several times).", "Exactly this. Not only would that teach the kid that being rough with an animal = bad (which yes should be her parents\u2019 responsibility but I\u2019m not holding my breath, you know?), lying and saying the cat is gone is just leaving OP wide open to the kid somehow finding out the cat is still there and deciding that OP is also wrong about everything else they said about the cat and anything she wants to do to it is fair game.", "Especially considering it's a kitten. Adult cats are able to bite back and 'tell' kids to stop when they don't like what's happening. Kittens are a lot smaller and don't quite have that figured out yet. OP should 100% have stopped this behaviour immediately instead of letting it go on for weeks and risking some serious injury to their pet.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

A bunch of kids from our neigbhorhood (6 or 7 of them), from age 4-8 running around the neighborhood and they often played at our house. \n\nI probably only knew one or two sets of parents out of the 6-7 kids. \n\nIt's a little worrying, honestly. I had to watch all those kids for hours and fed them too... and it's not like they behaved themselves. A couple of them 'borrowed' my kid's toys (albeit just a toy car or whatnot) too without asking. \n\n If I did allow my son to play at his friend's house, he'll play at a specific house, and I've talked to the parents beforehand so they know he's going to be there. I probably was a 'helicopter' parent, but I couldn't just let my kid run amok to unknown neighbor's house for hours. I mean, these kids would come from around 11 PM to 6-7 PM before going home. (It's summertime so no school), so they had to eat at our house...and I became the designated 'free babysitter' I suppose. I'm just glad my kid is an adult now lol.", "Comment stealing bot. Stole the comment from the comment by u/boringxicex which is literally directly above theirs.", "Well if the child was in his home and injured it would be on him. They could also try and make the case that anytime after the child has left his home and became injured is on him because he was the last person acting as caregiver and didn\u2019t insure the child was safely back in their own home if he\u2019s not walking them back and handing them over."]}
