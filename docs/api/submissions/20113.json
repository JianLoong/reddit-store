Now whenever I open my door, the kid is there at their door staring at me. The kid still doesn't go to school so she's always there  waiting for me to get home...\n\nA couple of days ago I was really tired from a hectic day. The kid came to me again demanding she wants to see the cat and I let her play with it for a while. I have observed her mishandling the cat and the cat also hates her. After a while she was taken home by her mother. Later I have ordered some food and opened my door to collect it, and there, the damn kid was again asking if she could play with the cat again. I got really vexed at this point and lied to her that  I have decided to give the cat away to a friend. Now the kid is sad and depressed and has stopped eating and that is making me feel guilty.

Not your kid, not your responsibility. Let her parents handle this. And how is a 3/4 year old just waiting by your door all damn day? Her parents need to act.

There are a thousand solutions to this but believe me you gotta make this stop or this will get worse and worse.", "NTA but her parents are.. why the hell are they letting their kid hang out at a neighbour's house alone? That's so fkn weird to me as a parent. Also that they are okay with her bothering her neighbour so much. My kids have been friends with neighbours we have in the past and I've always been clear that you can say hello and if invited over we can all go together but you're never to ask to visit or assume you're able to visit because you need to respect other people's time and space.", "NTA... That would annoy the hell out of me. Probably shouldn't have lied and just told the kid no.", "NTA her parents need to get her under control and teach her to stop harassing people. It's not your place to entertain her OR give into her spoiled demands", "Nta. If you haven't done so speak to the parents.  She shouldn't be coming to the door so often. Her parents will have to deal with this. You are the neighbor. You are not responsible for her. She is old enough to start accepting disappointment.  It's tough, but it is a lesson we all have to learn.", "NTA. I would have told the kid the cat does not like her since she mistreated the cat. The cat does not want to play with mean kids.", "NTA. Parents need to step up. Can you buy a Ring doorbell, so you can ignore the kid when they ring the bell? Also, who the crap lets their toddler run around outside unsupervised?

You and this kid's parents need to have a talk about teaching her boundaries. They also don't get to blame you for their kids' feelings. \n\nYou don't need to lie to people and give excuses; \"no\" is a complete sentence. Yes, even with preschool aged children. \n\nHonestly, \\*especially\\* for preschool aged children! Where the F have these neighbors been?", "Wanna know what happened when my aunt was little and mishandling the cat? She woke from her nap covered is scratches. Grandma and grandpa took the cat to an animal shelter and simply said \"our daughter is too young for a pet.\"\n\nI'm going with ESH simply because you should have brought up your concerns to her parents a while ago. If you did and they did nothing, then that's another story. Lying is not going to end well. If the child wants to interact with someone else's pet, she needs to learn to be mindful and respectful of both the animal and the owner. Neither of those things has been happening.", "While I can sympathize with you because you shouldn't have to accommodate your neighbor's kid in this way, you went about it the wrong way.\n\nLying and saying you gave the cat away was mean. Why not try to explain that the cat needs to rest alone and can't be played with all the time?\n\nOr... talk to your neighbors? That seems like the obvious solution to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "Yta, but I'd also say that was more a \"well that was dumb\" moment.\n\n>I have observed her mishandling the cat and the cat also hates her.\n\nAsides from the whole thing about how the kid will probably figure out you still have the cat at some point, you needed to say something to the parents here. Why didn't you just say no?", "YTA There are ways of telling the kid that she can't play with the cat. We had neighbor kids who asked to play with our dogs. I was with them when they they played. I thought it was a good idea to get the dog socialized around kids. Until it wasn't a good idea. I let the kids know that we could no longer let them play with the dogs. I didn't care if the kids got \"depressed.\" I had to protect the dog. The kid may be sad, but there are some good lessons in this situation.", "YTA for lying to the kid. The correct course of action would\u2019ve been to talk to the parents and tell them the kid can come play with the cat once a month and it needs to be pre arranged and supervised by the parents.", "this is very tricky for me, but I think you should talk to the parents.", "How on earth is this even a problem. You just tell the kid each time to go back home.", "NTA. I had a similar situation with me one summer with a new puppy I got and the 10 yr old kid next door. I couldn't even come home from errands or my lunch break because this kid was at my door hounding me constantly and I lived in a neighborhood  where the parents were so entitled they expected you to pick up their parenting slack. Maybe you should've told her \"no\" but so what if you didn't? It's also not your problem if she's depressed. Her parents were just passive aggressively using you as a free babysitter and that's unacceptable bullshit.", "Yeah, it\u2019s super weird. My kids are 7&9 and regularly ask to go over to say hi to Rosie. Rosie is the neighbor\u2019s golden retriever \ud83d\ude02\n\nI tell them no and they figure out something else to do lol\n\nAlso, we have dogs \u2014 they just love them all lol", "I see your point about lying but it should be the parent's job to tell the kid that she's going overboard and disrespecting boundaries. They should be the first to say no.", "They live in the neighbouring flat across the floor , it\u2019s easy for the kid to come and ring the bell. the door is never closed though. It kinda also gives me privacy concerns..", "She immediately starts crying out loud and making a scene when i try saying no to her. I actually tried it before but as this happened, i had to make up a lie..", "she isn\u2019t the parent and it isn\u2019t her job to teach a \u201cgood lesson\u201d to someone else\u2019s kid. It\u2019s her cat. her house. her decision. NTA", "The parents absolutely do not care about me or my cat. They do not even try to close their door fully knowing that their kid is bothering me. Also, they do not even try to explain to kid that animals are not toys and they have feelings too.. all these factors encouraged me to lie to the kid :(", "Yes, they should. But if it's left to the neighbor to have to say because they're not doing their job, it's better to say it directly, not lying about it. \"No, you can't come over and play with the cat anymore. She doesn't want you to, and neither do I. If it's ever okay again sometime, I'll tell you. Until then, you need to leave Kitty and me alone.\"", "I just get a bad feeling about this.  Anything happens to the kid, you are sued big time, even though the parents have abandoned their parental duties!!", "Walk into your house, close door. Yes she'll make a scene hut that's on her parents to sort out. Stop letting kids you dibt know inside your house unsupervised.\n\nKids are annoying, she'll just find something else to pester you about.", "I'm so gobsmacked they just let their 3/4 year old visit you whenever they want. Like it seems clear you're not but you could be a full on creep or predator and they wouldn't even know. Like wth!? Kids that age should not be in that situation in the first place.", ">They do not even try to close their door fully knowing that their kid is bothering me.\n\nYou need to call CPS if they're letting their 4 year old run around unsupervised.", "Look, I get all that and I can absolutely see why you did what you did but in terms of judgment you\u2019re still the AH lol. Sometimes we do AH things for our own peace of mind, which imo is what happened here. \n\nGiven the parents are also AHs maybe I\u2019d change this to ESH because it was the parents\u2019 responsibility to handle this AND if they\u2019re so clueless as to the whereabouts of their toddler idk why they told you kid\u2019s now depressed."]}
