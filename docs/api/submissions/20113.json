There's this neighboring kid (3-4 yrs old) who also wanted to have a kitten for her birthday but her parents did not want to take care of one so they didn't get her one. I happened to randomly get my new kitten at the exact same time. I let her play with my kitten a few times but it has got to a point where the kid is literally pestering me by ringing my doorbell and asking me each time I leave/enter the house if she could play with the cat. Now whenever I open my door, the kid is there at their door staring at me. The kid still doesn't go to school so she's always there  waiting for me to get home...\n\nA couple of days ago I was really tired from a hectic day. The kid came to me again demanding she wants to see the cat and I let her play with it for a while. I have observed her mishandling the cat and the cat also hates her. After a while she was taken home by her mother. Later I have ordered some food and opened my door to collect it, and there, the damn kid was again asking if she could play with the cat again. I got really vexed at this point and lied to her that  I have decided to give the cat away to a friend. Now the kid is sad and depressed and has stopped eating and that is making me feel guilty. She demands I bring back the cat. I just want to have some peaceful time after work and this kid has lately become a problem.  Am I the asshole here?\n\nUpdate: Wow this post really blew up. So taking all the suggestions into consideration, I have finally gathered the confidence to talk to the parents. I have told them politely that the kid needs to be explained why she can't be bothering me all the time and she might be only allowed on weekends for a while to casually see the cat but not everyday. They seemed to have understood the issue here. Have got to wait and see for a few days if the problem has been actually solved..\n\nThanks for all the opinions and suggestions.

If you did and they did nothing, then that's another story. Lying is not going to end well.

Neither of those things has been happening.", "While I can sympathize with you because you shouldn't have to accommodate your neighbor's kid in this way, you went about it the wrong way.\n\nLying and saying you gave the cat away was mean.

Maybe you should've told her \"no\" but so what if you didn't? It's also not your problem if she's depressed. Her parents were just passive aggressively using you as a free babysitter and that's unacceptable bullshit.", "Yeah, it\u2019s super weird.

This is their problem, not yours.", "NTA not your responsibility but neither is the suggestion.

You repeatedly observed mishandling of your kitten and you know your kitten is unhappy when near the kid but you aren't setting boundaries and talking to the kid about appropriate treatment of animals. \n\nYou chose to repeatedly allow the kid over without her parents. When you do that it's your responsibility to watch the kid during that time and teach her about how to treat an animal right. \n\nUltimately I don't blame you especially since the parents were failing  to talk to their kid about boundaries but I do feel like you could have handled things better", "YTA. I was very much on your side until you lied to the kid. She's super young and expressing how much she loves this cat. Yeah, it's annoying sometimes how kids express these things, but she's just interested.\n\nThe parents should be setting her boundaries and telling her to respect your space and ask first or set up a time that you agree with if she wants to see your cat.\n\nBut you don't have to lie to this kid to trick her. Just be honest, tell her you don't have time and that you want her to talk to her parents about this. She's not your kid, but she's still a person.\n\nAnd what happens when she inevitably finds out that the cat is still there?

On the other hand, it looks like their decision not to get her an animal was justified - and maybe you should have considered that they decided that for a good reason based on knowing what their child can be trusted to be mature enough for before you let her near your pet. This kid is TINY. That she is outside on her own hanging around is fucked up to the point of neglect.\n\nThe child sucks a tiny little bit for not handling the kitten properly and for hassling you, but this is just a kid being tiresome and needing to be watched and closely parented around animals in a way that is the case for all children. She doesn\u2019t know not to hassle you because she\u2019s not old enough to be socially aware. She doesn\u2019t know how to handle a kitten because she\u2019s barely more than a toddler, she doesn\u2019t have full motor control yet, and she has never had a kitten so she hasn\u2019t been taught.\n\nYou suck because:\n\n- You know your kitten doesn\u2019t like this kid! You\u2019ve seen her mishandle your kitten! Why are you continuing to subject your pet, for whose welfare and protection you are responsible, to being pestered in their own home by a child from whom they cannot escape? Stop subjecting your pet to things they hate for human amusement, it\u2019s not okay. You are the one fundamentally responsible for this kid mishandling your pet because you agreed to a kid with no pet experience bothering the kitten; stood there and let it happen; and then let the kid back again.

If you didn\u2019t want to do that you should have said no.\n\n- That\u2019s the core reason you suck: USE YOUR WORDS. Why did you decide to lie to a child in a completely pointless way? Why did you keep saying yes to something that you didn\u2019t want to happen? Why have you had none of this conversation with her parents at any stage? You are the adult, she is little more than a toddler, get a grip.\n\n- A child is being neglected literally on your doorstop and you\u2019re only noticing that she\u2019s annoying and inconvenient to you personally, not that there is a big problem here.\n\nHere are your next steps to stop sucking:\n\nThe next time there is a chance, ie you run into the parents or the child bothers you on the way home, you need to USE YOUR WORDS LIKE A GROWN UP.\n\nGet down to eye height with the kid and say: listen, I lied to you before.

I\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s go and talk to your parents.\n\nThen you walk the kid home and you say to mom and dad: I need you to take over from here with your kid. I understand she likes cats but she cannot come over to play with my kitten anymore. She doesn\u2019t play gently and it isn\u2019t fun for the kitten, and she\u2019s not my kid so it\u2019s not up to me to teach her to handle animals. I need you to help her understand that she cannot visit the kitten. Specifically I need you to make sure she is not constantly on my doorstep every day asking me to let her into my house. I am not happy having her visit alone and unsupervised and I am not happy that so small a child is on my doorstep unsupervised. I shouldn\u2019t have let this go on so long before expressing how uncomfortable I am with this, so I apologise if this is coming out of nowhere for you, but I\u2019ve hit a point where I just don\u2019t want her to visit at all anymore. From now on any time I find her outside my door or around my house or asking me to see the kitten on the way in or out, I\u2019m going to walk her back to your house. Please supervise her more closely so we can shut this habit down as quickly and cleanly as possible.\n\nThen do as you have said. Walk her home and tell her parents \u201cshe is at my house unsupervised again, she is too young to be out alone, please watch your child\u201d. Then note down the date and time and what happened, and if the pattern doesn\u2019t drop off quickly, contact social services because *a tiny child is wandering alone and unsupervised outside*.\n\nStop letting her near your cat, talk to the other adults to express what you want, and escalate the real problem to the authorities if they don\u2019t fix it.

Plus if you try to talk to them first, not only are you risking retaliation, but you have also given them a heads up that someone is concerned about their kid\u2019s welfare, making it a bit more likely that they will hide any other evidence in their home of neglect. When CPS comes, you want it to be a surprise, so they will find anything there is to find.", "The only thing I can think of is maybe they think you\u2019re calling the kid an asshole?  Except anyone with any reading comprehension AT ALL would see that you\u2019re calling the parents assholes, not the kid.", "Easy solution:\n\n\"Can I play with you cat?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnd shut the door.", "NTA! The parents are creating an entitled child.", "No, who cares, right?  It's all about you and your me time!!  Should have told her it got run over by a truck, no bringing her back after dat!!!", "NTA - I wouldn't have lied, I would have said I can't let you play with the cat since it is tired and keep repeating it each time.\nMaybe let her play with it once every week.", "YTA-  If you had a problem a simple convo with the parents should have sufficed. You were just cruel because you were tired and annoyed. Kids may not like it but just saying another time or I'm busy right now is absolutely a good enough response. Followed  with a head home to your parents please. It's weirdthat you've allowed this to go on and then punish her.  t", ">NTA. Not your kid, not your responsibility. Let her parents handle this. And **how is a 3/4 year old just waiting by your door all damn day?** \n\nI'd start calling the non emergency number for your local police if that started happening to me.", "Exactly like if it were me I wouldn't even let any strange kids near a kitten while they're still in their socializing phase. And if I did and they mistreated it that would be the end of it, I wouldn't let them in my home ever again. OP basically let this kid torment their cat to the point that the cat actively hates this kid... imagine feeling so unsafe in your own home cause you're forced to interact with someone who keeps hurting you? That kid wasn't entitled to meeting the kitten in the first place, OP sort of dug their own grave with this.", "It was bizarre,,", "Then say \"no, kitty doesn't want to play\". Tell the truth, she's going to see the cat in the window at some point and find out the OP was lying.", "Could be, my oldest is 7 but on the smaller side so I could see someone thinking he's 5 or so.", "Pretty much \ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s also one thing for them to say hi as they walk by to/from the bus when they\u2019re (the neighbor and dog) already outside \u2014 it\u2019s a whole different level to just go over and ring the doorbell and ask to play with the dog lol", "For a toddler, their body control and sense of awareness of where their body is in relation to the things around them is not as good as an adult\u2019s. An overexcited toddler could easily accidentally be too rough or otherwise injure a kitten without intending to. Especially if their parents haven\u2019t been putting any effort into teaching them the beginnings of self control.", "But at 3-4 years old? Absolutely not", "Yeah my almost 3 year old nephew doesn't get that if he gives his baby brother a big squeeze it can hurt him. We of course constantly tell him to be gentle.", "The parents also figure that if their child gets to play with your cat,  then subject closed to getting a cat of their own. \n\nAt her age she needs to be taught how to pet and play with any pet because they don't know. They can't read until they are taught either. \n\nOdd to me that they can see into your home to the extent they can see everything. In guessing that means the child can too. I'd be putting up drapes or frosting the windows.\n\nDo the parents ever take her to the park to play and run around? She might be wound up with energy. Maybe bored as well if no kids to okay with - might also be why she wants a pet.\n\nRegardless you're entitled to your space and not to accept unexpected visitors. \n\nThat said,  talk to the parents. That you didn't mind a visit or two for the week, but every day and more often is just too much. Suggest they take her to the park where owners might be walking their dogs or other kids to play with there.  I have a friend who wants a pet but landlord doesn't allow pets - so she goes to the pet store that's close by to visit them. Parents could also see if pet shelters would allow visitors.\n\nEdit to add NTA.", "OMG memories! \n\nI used to go on walks with my mom around the neighborhood after she moved into my aunt's house. My mother would always bring dog treats and there was a beautiful golden retriever called Rosie who just adored my mom! There was a small hole in the fence and my mom would slip a treat into Rosie's mouth when we passed her. Whenever she saw us pass by, Rosie was right up against the fence with her little wet nose peeking through that hole. \n\nThat was a long time ago and my mom is no longer with us. She adored animals more than anything in the world and gave money to animal charities until she passed away.  \n\nThank you so much for that little trip down memory lane. \n\nAs for OP: NTA. It's concerning that the parents are just allowing their child to harass you for any reason. There are kids in my neighborhood around the same age and none of them bother me at all, in fact, they are quite nice and very respectful. I always wave and say Hi to them when they're out playing. \n\nJust because you have a cat doesn't mean that their child can just come over and bother you nonstop - not to mention that you're concerned about how she's handling the poor thing. I'd have no trouble shooing her away from my door and telling her sternly to go home.", "NO. DO. NOT GIVE. THE. KID. A. KITTEN. EVER", "Like my dad is fond of saying, the pendulum always swings back. Things go from one extreme to the other and back and forth. It might take a long time but the pendulum always swings back. There is danger in being underprotective and overprotective. Few people hit the Goldilocks Zone in the middle. Your childhood sounds like my dad's. He and his friends are the reason their town had a professional fire company and not just volunteers.", "lying to a child makes you a bad person. I'm sorry I had to be the one to tell you.", "I think we need to see this kitten to make a proper and informed judgment.", "Also, I bet the kid was *really* begging for a kitten, and having access to OP\u2019s got her to shut up.", "Oh god this just brought childhood flashback of my neighbor's two year old running down the street, buck naked, at least once a week. And it wasn't like we were next door neighbors...we lived at least 10-12 houses down the street around a corner. She's managed to survive to adulthood, but damn, she's lucky there were no cars coming around a blind corner.", "a very unrealistic take, being truthful to kids 100% of the time just isnt feasible, there will be situations where u might need to withhold the truth for a better reason.\n\n(in this situation i suppose OP could have just spoken to the parents, but if OP doesnt want the extra hassle that comes with that then... anything goes)", "Who is Santa or the Easter Bunny?", "I was so overwhelmed watching 6 to 8 kids at a time that my husband finally kind of made me stop doing this and just start saying 'no' to those random children stopping by.\n\nThe straw was when one random child (plus his buddies), he was older, maybe around 10...came with one of those folding knives threatening to kill us. I had to kick them out, I found out whom the parent/guardian (parents not around, he was living with his grandparents around 4 houses down (not even in our block). My husband went to talk to his grandparents to let them know that one was not allowed to play with our son and to never stop by our house anymore.\n\nI suppose stories of my husband's 'anger' or grumpiness spread out faster than forest fire that the next year, we only had a couple or a few kids stopping by instead. LOL.", "you're right, there are exceptions. But I don't think this is one of them!", "there are exceptions where it might be arguably okay to life to kids, sure. But I don't think this is an exception!\n\nI think that lying to kids, especially for self-serving reasons, is generally considered an 'asshole' thing to do. I didn't know that was so controversial lol", "\u201cA taco-licking Wiccan\u201d!!!!!\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nI\u2019m totally stealing this term!", "This. Tell the kid you'll have free kittens to give away starting the next day, your friend just rescued, say, 20 cats, or whatever number sounds close enough to an infinite kitten supply. Tell them to ask their parents if it's OK to bring some home and enjoy the kid never being allowed near your door again.", "From another comment it sounds like they live in apartments and the neighbors just leave their door open a lot? Still yikes but at least it doesn't seem like the kid is as much at risk of being kidnapped.", "if the parents dont care why do you care so much? tell the kid no and to stop bothering you \"grown ups do work at home so you can't ring the doorbell anymore\" and close the door.", "She has access to my flat. She was okay with the kid for the first few times and then later on realized that this was becoming a problem.."]}
