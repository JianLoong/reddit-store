After a while she was taken home by her mother. Later I have ordered some food and opened my door to collect it, and there, the damn kid was again asking if she could play with the cat again. I got really vexed at this point and lied to her that  I have decided to give the cat away to a friend. Now the kid is sad and depressed and has stopped eating and that is making me feel guilty.

You and this kid's parents need to have a talk about teaching her boundaries. They also don't get to blame you for their kids' feelings. \n\nYou don't need to lie to people and give excuses; \"no\" is a complete sentence. Yes, even with preschool aged children. \n\nHonestly, \\*especially\\* for preschool aged children! Where the F have these neighbors been?", "Wanna know what happened when my aunt was little and mishandling the cat? She woke from her nap covered is scratches. Grandma and grandpa took the cat to an animal shelter and simply said \"our daughter is too young for a pet.\"\n\nI'm going with ESH simply because you should have brought up your concerns to her parents a while ago. If you did and they did nothing, then that's another story. Lying is not going to end well. If the child wants to interact with someone else's pet, she needs to learn to be mindful and respectful of both the animal and the owner. Neither of those things has been happening.", "While I can sympathize with you because you shouldn't have to accommodate your neighbor's kid in this way, you went about it the wrong way.\n\nLying and saying you gave the cat away was mean. Why not try to explain that the cat needs to rest alone and can't be played with all the time?\n\nOr... talk to your neighbors? That seems like the obvious solution to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "Yta, but I'd also say that was more a \"well that was dumb\" moment.\n\n>I have observed her mishandling the cat and the cat also hates her.\n\nAsides from the whole thing about how the kid will probably figure out you still have the cat at some point, you needed to say something to the parents here. Why didn't you just say no?", "YTA There are ways of telling the kid that she can't play with the cat. We had neighbor kids who asked to play with our dogs. I was with them when they they played. I thought it was a good idea to get the dog socialized around kids. Until it wasn't a good idea. I let the kids know that we could no longer let them play with the dogs. I didn't care if the kids got \"depressed.\" I had to protect the dog. The kid may be sad, but there are some good lessons in this situation.", "YTA for lying to the kid. The correct course of action would\u2019ve been to talk to the parents and tell them the kid can come play with the cat once a month and it needs to be pre arranged and supervised by the parents.", "this is very tricky for me, but I think you should talk to the parents.", "How on earth is this even a problem. You just tell the kid each time to go back home.", "NTA. I had a similar situation with me one summer with a new puppy I got and the 10 yr old kid next door. I couldn't even come home from errands or my lunch break because this kid was at my door hounding me constantly and I lived in a neighborhood  where the parents were so entitled they expected you to pick up their parenting slack. Maybe you should've told her \"no\" but so what if you didn't? It's also not your problem if she's depressed. Her parents were just passive aggressively using you as a free babysitter and that's unacceptable bullshit.", "Yeah, it\u2019s super weird. My kids are 7&9 and regularly ask to go over to say hi to Rosie. Rosie is the neighbor\u2019s golden retriever \ud83d\ude02\n\nI tell them no and they figure out something else to do lol\n\nAlso, we have dogs \u2014 they just love them all lol", "I see your point about lying but it should be the parent's job to tell the kid that she's going overboard and disrespecting boundaries. They should be the first to say no.", "They live in the neighbouring flat across the floor , it\u2019s easy for the kid to come and ring the bell. the door is never closed though. It kinda also gives me privacy concerns..", "She immediately starts crying out loud and making a scene when i try saying no to her. I actually tried it before but as this happened, i had to make up a lie..", "she isn\u2019t the parent and it isn\u2019t her job to teach a \u201cgood lesson\u201d to someone else\u2019s kid. It\u2019s her cat. her house. her decision. NTA", "The parents absolutely do not care about me or my cat. They do not even try to close their door fully knowing that their kid is bothering me. Also, they do not even try to explain to kid that animals are not toys and they have feelings too.. all these factors encouraged me to lie to the kid :(", "Yes, they should. But if it's left to the neighbor to have to say because they're not doing their job, it's better to say it directly, not lying about it. \"No, you can't come over and play with the cat anymore. She doesn't want you to, and neither do I. If it's ever okay again sometime, I'll tell you. Until then, you need to leave Kitty and me alone.\"", "I just get a bad feeling about this.  Anything happens to the kid, you are sued big time, even though the parents have abandoned their parental duties!!", "Walk into your house, close door. Yes she'll make a scene hut that's on her parents to sort out. Stop letting kids you dibt know inside your house unsupervised.\n\nKids are annoying, she'll just find something else to pester you about.", "I'm so gobsmacked they just let their 3/4 year old visit you whenever they want. Like it seems clear you're not but you could be a full on creep or predator and they wouldn't even know. Like wth!? Kids that age should not be in that situation in the first place.", ">They do not even try to close their door fully knowing that their kid is bothering me.\n\nYou need to call CPS if they're letting their 4 year old run around unsupervised.", "Look, I get all that and I can absolutely see why you did what you did but in terms of judgment you\u2019re still the AH lol. Sometimes we do AH things for our own peace of mind, which imo is what happened here. \n\nGiven the parents are also AHs maybe I\u2019d change this to ESH because it was the parents\u2019 responsibility to handle this AND if they\u2019re so clueless as to the whereabouts of their toddler idk why they told you kid\u2019s now depressed.", "100% not the asshole. Having the kid over once to say hello to the cat was more than enough. You and the cat deserve your space and privacy. The lie came out of necessity to bring an end to the situation. The kid will either get over it or parents will have to get her a cat. Either way not your problem. Ignore the child and the parents from now on. If she demands you bring the cat back say cat is happy and likes the peace where she is now. Cat is not coming back. Kid will get over it eventually.", "NTA, don\u2019t allow this, if the kid gets hurt or the parents come making accusations you won\u2019t be able to prove anything. If the kid wants to say hi to the cat the parents need to be there", "Nta\u2026. This is the exact reason I don\u2019t interact with the neighbours kids yes I have kids they\u2019re my problem I don\u2019t push them on my neighbours we got a puppy every kid in the street wanted to play with the puppy it was a resounding NO even when the puppy was in the garden I don\u2019t need expensive vet bill if they hurt it or puppy picking up bad habits like jumping up chasing kids etc", "NTA. Tell the parents this has to stop and they need to stop her hanging about your door. At her age even in a block of flats she should not be by herself unsupervised. And her parents should not be allowing her to invade your personal space. Do not feel guilty. Look after your own and your cats well being. This child is her parent\u2019s responsibility not yours.", "NTA, you have tried saying no to the kid and talk to the parents. If that doesn't help, this is probably the only way for you to get your quiet time", "NTA, but talk to the parents!", "NTA but i would have put a stop to it after a day to be honest.\nIts super weird to have some kid constantly at your door wanting to annoy your pet.\nIts even more weird that the parents think this is ok!", "ESH. If someone isn\u2019t nice to your animal, you tell them how to be nice to that animal. Not because you\u2019re obligated to teach the kid, but because you are the voice that your animal doesn\u2019t have. \nAnd instead of lying that you gave the cat away, just say \u201cno, not right now\u201d if you don\u2019t want visitors. \n\nAlso, obviously the parents suck. Who lets their 3-4 year old just roam free?!", "Nta", "NTA\n\nThis kid's parents need to be taking care of their child. Their child shouldn't be randomly wandering around to neighbor's places, and maybe they should even get her a cat. This is bizarre.", "NTA,. don't let the kids come around anymore. They are not your problem. What the hell are.the parents doing allowing such a small child to visit neighbors alone.", "NTA. The parents should've just gotten her a cat of her own instead of letting their kid just roam around alone. Irresponsible as shit parents! Besides, not your kid, not your responsibility. You're not obligated to do anything for her.", "Why isn\u2019t this kid in school", "Do you not know how to say no? It\u2019s easy no explanation necessary.", "NTA - kids parents are right in that a kid that small can't look after a kitten, and it sounds like she would do the opposite by bothering the hell out of it. Also, they're absolute AHs for letting their very small child go off alone. Do they want her to be snatched?! This is their problem, not yours.", "NTA not your responsibility but neither is the suggestion. If it was me I would ask someone to do a welfare check because that is an extreme reaction to not eat over this like she was desprate to have someone/thing in her life. This isn't normal to not eat over this at that age. I have a feeling something is going on.", "NTA. Why are you letting a child push you around? \"No\" is a complete sentence.", "NTA.\nThe cat  doesn\u2019t like her and she is mishandling it, it\u2019s a recipe for disaster.  Any time she spends with the cat is going to be unfair on the cat.\nIf the cat scratches or attacks her then the kids parents will no doubt try to hold you responsible for any medical and emotional distress the kid the night suffer.\nPlus the fact it\u2019s not you kid, the parents are just letting her come to you so that they don\u2019t have buy the kid her own cat and be responsible for the all of costs involved relating to it.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you could have addressed the masses of red flags here right at the beginning. This tiny human is hanging around your door at all hours of the day and night. You should have raised it with the parents right at the beginning. If you didn't want to speak to the parents which is understandable in some circumstances, then you had other options such as CPS.", "NTA\n\nWhy her parents let her be by herself like that ? I mean ... Not to be paranoid, but that's wild to let their very young daughter alone to see a neighbour.\n\nShe need to learn that you don't bother people all day long at their house and that sometimes, yeah, life is sad because you can't have a cat (yeah, i get it, but still)\n\nI had a similar issue with kids where i used to lived, 2 kids would come to my garden every day to \"play with you cats / video games\". I'm so glad i don't live here anymore because i think i would have be rude with kids and parents after a while.\n\nTalk to her parents, it's their responsability to talk to their daughter about her issue with intimacy and to deal with their decision to not have a cat of their own.\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d", "ESH - at least the adults\n\nParents shouldn\u2019t be letting her pester you so much; you could be honest with her!", "NTA I would be so pissed off at this, you sound like you were so patient so kudos to you for that. \n\nbut this kid has no right to come over all the time and the parents should be telling it that. \n\nI feel  for the kid in a way cos I was a lonely kid with only the neighbours cats for friends after school (we lived in a different area to my pals) but I only ever saw the cats on the street, I loved them well and never once knocked on the neighbours door! I don't think I did anyway. eep. \n\nbut not your problem and NO MISHANDLING !!!!!", "NTA, she can\u2019t be coming over to your home all the time and clearly doesn\u2019t know how to handle a kitten. I probably wouldn\u2019t have lied to her though, maybe speaking to the parents would be better. I\u2019d personally probably arrange an occasional supervised visit where the little girl could be shown how to properly handle a kitten (kids don\u2019t always understand this on their own and I\u2019m grateful that someone taught me at that age), but if the kitten already doesn\u2019t like her that ship may have sailed.", "NTA. You needed to draw the line somewhere. She'll get over it and find some other kitten to bother. And although lying is normally AH behavior it was a white lie for boundaries' sake.
