I changed my number and deleted all social media so haven't had anything from them personally for about 6 weeks. My sister apologised for what she said, and we've spoken alot about it all. I definitely don't think our relationship is the same, but we're okay.\n\n\nI still hear they're speaking badly about me from friends, but I try and ignore it. \n\n\nI'm in therapy still and am trying my hardest to move forward with everything. I visit my sons grave when I can. Thankfully my ex and his family care so little about more than themselves they never asked where he is buried so I can do so in peace. \n\n\nThank you all for everything you said. I have found myself going back to the previous post alot over the last couple of months and it has helped more than I can express. I'll be leaving this account now, but again, thank you.\n\n\nEdit: link to previous post\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13o2pzh/aita_for_not_trying_harder_to_let_my_ex_know_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1", "created_utc": 1691683036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ngb29/update_aita_for_not_trying_harder_to_let_my_ex/", "score": 278, "replies": ["I am so glad you are okey OP. I remember your post and your ex and his family are truly awful.", "Thank you for the update, OP! And may you find peace, especially away from your AH ex and the flying monkeys around him!", "I remember your post, OP. I'm so sorry about your son, but I'm glad you're in therapy and have some distance from those toxic, awful people. I wish you all the best - you deserve some good things coming your way.", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13o2pzh/aita_for_not_trying_harder_to_let_my_ex_know_our/)", "OP I'm so happy to hear that you've gotten away from those people. I'm not sure if it's my place (or anyone's really) to just say when the his birthday comes please make sure that you have friends and family around you. I lost my daughter at 6 months when I was 21 and for the first year I grieved, went through therapy and I thought \"I'm okay\".... then her first birthday came. It was the first and only time I was Baker Acted. I don't say this to scare or to be cruel but it's been 5 years and I still have to request her birthday off. I'm not going to be one of those people that say it gets \"better\" honestly it doesn't in the way people think it does but it gets easier. \n\nI know everyone grieves and moves on differently but please know there is NO shame in not being okay even years later. You owe NOONE an explanation, so many people wanted to know how, why, did you get to hold her so many rude invasive painful questions just tell them to f*ck off unless they are someone who you want to tell.\n\nAnd please don't make the mistakes I did. I got rid of all the things I had bought for her because they hurt so much to look at. I wish I had kept some of the important things like what would have been her first Halloween costume and birthday dress. I thought not having her things around would help and for a while it did but in the long run I regret it.\n\nI'm not sure if you are religious (I'm personally not I consider myself spiritual) but one the best things someone said to me was that the reason they didn't stay with us is their souls were called to help another mother have a child because they knew we were strong enough to bear the pain. I choose to believe my Lily's soul is out there bringing a smile to a family who needed one. \n\nTake care of yourself please.", "I remember your post and how heartbreaking it was to read. The cruelty and audacity of your ex and his family remains astonishing. I'm so glad that you're well away from them now, and can concentrate on  your own journey of grief and healing. All the very best to you.", "So happy your safe, sorry they did that to you OP \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude2d", "I'm glad to hear things are going okay.", "Best wishes for the rest of your life. Without this awful family.", "Stay strong op and proud of you", "&#x200B;\n\nMy condolences on your loss. Good luck with moving forward. It sounds very much like you are doing that with grace and dignity. Losing a parent is hard enough, the loss of a child is devastating.", "So glad you're ok, and still so sad you had to deal with such a disfunctional crap while pregnant and grieving. Wish you all the best, since now on I hope only good things will happen to you", "I cannot believe people act the way they do sometimes\u2026.", "Once again, so sorry for the loss of your son. I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re doing well and are safe from your ex.", "I'm still really mad on your behalf.   I can't believe they had the fucking audacity to blame you when he completely disappeared.   What a pack of horrible losers.\n\nI'm glad you've moved away!", "If you still have a copy of all notifications post them to social media and say that your ex is trying to stir up drama.", "I can't help but wonder what they're even saying. Like, how do you embellish (especially to yourself) going no contact for half a year without explanation and paint yourself as the victim?  \nVery telling they don't even know where the grave is.  \n\nMany internet hugs, OP, if you want them. And my condolences again.", "I really hope that, right before she changed her number, she texted the link to the first post to everyone who's backing her ex."]}
