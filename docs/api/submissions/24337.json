I changed my number and deleted all social media so haven't had anything from them personally for about 6 weeks. My sister apologised for what she said, and we've spoken alot about it all. I definitely don't think our relationship is the same, but we're okay.\n\n\nI still hear they're speaking badly about me from friends, but I try and ignore it. \n\n\nI'm in therapy still and am trying my hardest to move forward with everything. I visit my sons grave when I can. Thankfully my ex and his family care so little about more than themselves they never asked where he is buried so I can do so in peace. \n\n\nThank you all for everything you said. I have found myself going back to the previous post alot over the last couple of months and it has helped more than I can express. I'll be leaving this account now, but again, thank you.\n\n\nEdit: link to previous post\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13o2pzh/aita_for_not_trying_harder_to_let_my_ex_know_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1", "created_utc": 1691683036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ngb29/update_aita_for_not_trying_harder_to_let_my_ex/", "score": 600, "replies": ["I am so glad you are okey OP. I remember your post and your ex and his family are truly awful.", "Thank you for the update, OP! And may you find peace, especially away from your AH ex and the flying monkeys around him!", "I remember your post, OP. I'm so sorry about your son, but I'm glad you're in therapy and have some distance from those toxic, awful people. I wish you all the best - you deserve some good things coming your way.", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13o2pzh/aita_for_not_trying_harder_to_let_my_ex_know_our/)", "OP I'm so happy to hear that you've gotten away from those people. I'm not sure if it's my place (or anyone's really) to just say when the his birthday comes please make sure that you have friends and family around you. I lost my daughter at 6 months when I was 21 and for the first year I grieved, went through therapy and I thought \"I'm okay\".... then her first birthday came. It was the first and only time I was Baker Acted. I don't say this to scare or to be cruel but it's been 5 years and I still have to request her birthday off. I'm not going to be one of those people that say it gets \"better\" honestly it doesn't in the way people think it does but it gets easier. \n\nI know everyone grieves and moves on differently but please know there is NO shame in not being okay even years later. You owe NOONE an explanation, so many people wanted to know how, why, did you get to hold her so many rude invasive painful questions just tell them to f*ck off unless they are someone who you want to tell.\n\nAnd please don't make the mistakes I did. I got rid of all the things I had bought for her because they hurt so much to look at. I wish I had kept some of the important things like what would have been her first Halloween costume and birthday dress. I thought not having her things around would help and for a while it did but in the long run I regret it.\n\nI'm not sure if you are religious (I'm personally not I consider myself spiritual) but one the best things someone said to me was that the reason they didn't stay with us is their souls were called to help another mother have a child because they knew we were strong enough to bear the pain. I choose to believe my Lily's soul is out there bringing a smile to a family who needed one. \n\nTake care of yourself please.", "I remember your post and how heartbreaking it was to read. The cruelty and audacity of your ex and his family remains astonishing. I'm so glad that you're well away from them now, and can concentrate on  your own journey of grief and healing. All the very best to you.", "So happy your safe, sorry they did that to you OP \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude2d", "I'm glad to hear things are going okay.", "Best wishes for the rest of your life. Without this awful family.", "Stay strong op and proud of you", "&#x200B;\n\nMy condolences on your loss. Good luck with moving forward. It sounds very much like you are doing that with grace and dignity. Losing a parent is hard enough, the loss of a child is devastating.", "So glad you're ok, and still so sad you had to deal with such a disfunctional crap while pregnant and grieving. Wish you all the best, since now on I hope only good things will happen to you", "I cannot believe people act the way they do sometimes\u2026.", "Once again, so sorry for the loss of your son. I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re doing well and are safe from your ex.", "I'm still really mad on your behalf.   I can't believe they had the fucking audacity to blame you when he completely disappeared.   What a pack of horrible losers.\n\nI'm glad you've moved away!", "If you still have a copy of all notifications post them to social media and say that your ex is trying to stir up drama.", "I can't help but wonder what they're even saying. Like, how do you embellish (especially to yourself) going no contact for half a year without explanation and paint yourself as the victim?  \nVery telling they don't even know where the grave is.  \n\nMany internet hugs, OP, if you want them. And my condolences again.", "I really hope that, right before she changed her number, she texted the link to the first post to everyone who's backing her ex.", " NTA. You tried and they failed YOU every step of the way. I\u2019m so sorry honey, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re away from them!", "I didn't see your original post, but I am so, so sorry for the loss of your beautiful son. And that his father is such a horrific person. It's so good that you're in a new place where you don't have to see those people again. Just remember that there are a lot of Internet strangers who wish you well.", "It\u2019s really good you can visit your son\u2019s grave in peace. I wish you well in life.", ">\u201dMy sister apologised for what she said, and we've spoken alot about it all.\u201d\n\nPerhaps you can explain what she was thinking to us.", "Your statement about it getting easier, but not necessarily better, reminded me of this really great analogy I heard a while ago.\n\nGrief is like a ball in a box. Imagine you have a box, and on one side is a pain button, and a ball (your grief) is bouncing around in there. Everytime it hits the pain button, it hurts just as much as the first time. At first, that ball is massive; it's almost as big as the box, and it's hitting the button almost constantly, but over time it begins to shrink.\n\nIt will still hit the button from time to time, and it will still hurt just as badly when it does, but it will also hit that button less and less until it's almost completely gone.", "That's a great analogy, consider it stolen and added to the things I tell myself when I need it \ud83d\ude0a", "That's a great analogy, consider it stolen and added to the things I tell myself when I need it \ud83d\ude0a", "I\u2019ve spent 20 years in social services and people twist narratives all the time, give half truths and carefully selected info. They likely tell people \u201cshe never even called or texted\u201d and people don\u2019t ask whether or not she was blocked.", "If a guy tells me he wasn't aware of the details of the pregnancy, because the pregnant person never called or texted, I'm definitely thinking *why didn't you call or text, even as a so-called gold star gay, I'm aware of how pregnancy progresses*. I might not say anything, but my side eye is beyond bombastic!", "Man, your sister is a disgusting individual. Were you supposed to keep trying to contact your ex for the rest of his life if he never responded?\n\nEither way, I am glad you are doing better. I can't stand people like your ex.", "My heart is breaking for you. I am so sorry for your loss. You are a better/stronger person than me, I wouldn't have had it in me to try so hard.\n\nI am glad you are seeing a therapist and can visit your son's resting place in peace. My sincere condolences. I'm giving you a virtual hug and sending lots of healing vibes your way.", "I'm glad you are moved away. I'm sorry they are trashing you to make themselves feel better.", "Grief as a heavy backpack is the analogy I heard and used. when you first put it on and for some time, you notice it, it's in the way, it's heavy. But over time you adjust to it and you don't notice it as much. The weight doesn't change, the size, doesn't change, you just slowly adapt to it. \n\nBut that lovely line of \"what is grief if not love persevering\" also helps me at times.", "They stole it too.", "I\u2019m sorry for all the bullshit you went through. Your ex is a worthless coward.", "Wish you healing and peace and security. I hope one of your friends will stand up to your ex and tell the truth sometime. But I think it would be a terrible punishment for the people in that family to just have to deal with each other for the rest of their lives because they sound so deeply cruel and rageful, I'm sure they'll see that side of one another in time. wish you the best", "My favourite is the crater analogy. \n\n\"Grief is like a crater made by a bomb, or a meteorite; all chard earth and barren. But, if you leave a crater alone long enough, flowers start to grow in it. And animals move in. Sometimes, a crater becomes a lake. It\u2019s still a crater, but it\u2019s beautiful. But you can\u2019t really see it at first glance. The hole inside you is the same. Beautiful things are going to grow there. The memories you have of them and the things you did with them. New memories you make in their honor and just the happy things that are going to happen in your life. And one day, you\u2019ll look at the hole, at it\u2019ll still be there, but it won't seem so bad.\""]}
