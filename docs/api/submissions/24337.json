I changed my number and deleted all social media so haven't had anything from them personally for about 6 weeks. My sister apologised for what she said, and we've spoken alot about it all. I definitely don't think our relationship is the same, but we're okay.\n\n\nI still hear they're speaking badly about me from friends, but I try and ignore it. \n\n\nI'm in therapy still and am trying my hardest to move forward with everything. I visit my sons grave when I can. Thankfully my ex and his family care so little about more than themselves they never asked where he is buried so I can do so in peace. \n\n\nThank you all for everything you said. I have found myself going back to the previous post alot over the last couple of months and it has helped more than I can express. I'll be leaving this account now, but again, thank you.\n\n\nEdit: link to previous post\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13o2pzh/aita_for_not_trying_harder_to_let_my_ex_know_our/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1", "created_utc": 1691683036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ngb29/update_aita_for_not_trying_harder_to_let_my_ex/", "score": 28, "replies": ["I am so glad you are okey OP.
