My husband likes showers like you do, and I can barely stand it. When I (notice I say I, because if I am the one who wants to shower together, he shouldnt have to be uncomfortable) chose to compromise and shower with him, I stay out of the water, or use the water bouncing off of him, giving it a chance to cool down some.  Before any keyboard warriors out there come for me, it's a 2 way street. When he joins me in the shower, he knows the temp isn't going up much.\n\nI get your wife's point, but maybe there can be a compromise to the compromise. She could join you halfway through, stay out of the direct water, then finish her shower at her temperature after you are done.\n\nYou and your wife are trying to navigate one of the hardest times in a relationship. I wish you both the best.", "NTA\n\nYou two need to find what works for you but you for sure need your own time to relax and unwind.", "I would say NTA.  Having time together is important.  But your wife decided that sharing showers was the way to get some time with you, but didn't get any agreement from you.  Considering the temperatures that you both like, this just wouldn't work.  Who cares what the reason might be for you liking hot showers, that's irrelevant.  Sorry your time together is so short and hope that you find some way to be with each other.", "NAH.  My husband and I had all of these romantic ideas about couple showers when we first moved in together. I like my showers hot enough to make my skin red, and he likes them just above room temperature. One or both of us was always miserable, so we just don\u2019t shower together unless the mood is perfect and water temp doesn\u2019t matter. We found different ways to spend time together. I suggest you guys do the same.", "NTA. It\u2019s only relaxing if both of you enjoy it. And since you don\u2019t she needs to let it go. If it really stresses you out then she needs to drop the idea.", "NTA.  You guys need to figure out another way for couple time.   You also need to be honest with her if you are not yet ready for baby number 2.", "NTA. It's not a compromise to just do the thing she wants. There must be other ways to spend time together. Each day has 1440 minutes, and your showers are taking up 30 of those minutes or less.\n\nAlso, \"playfully\" doing something to your partner after they have said no is not \"playful\" it's rude (or worse).\n\nIt's worth talking to her about exactly what need she's trying to fill with this group shower idea, and they working together to find another way to fill that need.\n\nGood luck, OP. My guess is that there are larger issues at play here.", "Nta not a reasonable compromise to ask for imo. Shower temps are personal and a part of many peoples mandatory becoming a person routine. \n\nShe absolutely does deserve adult time! You two ABSOLUTELY need to find some time for being adults together, but morning showers aren\u2019t the time to do it.\n\nShe\u2019s the asshole for making it about your childhood.", "NTA, and maybe if you guys are this hard up for quality time she needs to cool it on planning for kid #2?\n\nPlenty of couples with a single six month old manage to spend time together without having to share a shower.", "NAH.  Showers together don't sound like such a hot idea.  Maybe you can carve out some other time together that doesn't require such a drastic compromise.", "Then just don't take showers together.", "NTA\n\nCouple showers are also overrated for this very reason. Plus they don't flow as smoothly as one thinks.", "NTA.  Why can't SHE compromise & take hot showers?", "NAH the suggested way to spend time together doesn\u2019t work and is causing conflict\u2026 have seperate showers\u2026", "NTA.\n\nPart of a relationship is accepting that there are some things you can\u2019t compromise about.  You don\u2019t form one combined homogenous blob.  The appropriate compromise here is that you like different showers, and just need your own space in the morning.  You have to agree to disagree.", "NTA. Should be a basic right of marriage to shower alone, at your preferred temperature, ya know? Just run for the bathroom screaming, \"I DO NOT CONSENT!\". But like, when I want to hang out with my husband while he's showering I just sit on the floor by the tub and ogle him around the shower curtain, while I tell him about my day. I *think* he likes it.", "NAH.  There have to be other ways to spend time with each other that you both like.  Showers are a very personal experience and if you don't like them the same way then it's just not going to be nice for both of you. I've never really understood recreational joint showers anyway - seems like someone is always either getting cold because they're not under the water or they're getting water in their eyes or something.  If you don't want the same thing then you need to find something else to be your thing and she shouldn't get hung up on wanting to shower with you. \nThat said - 15-20 minute showers???? That's a huge waste of water.  Shorter shower on your own and 15 minute coffee together sounds like the compromise to get some one on one time.  If you're not prepared to give up the shower time because it's your personal time (which is understandable, albeit expensive and environmentally unsustainable) then don't tell her it's because of the temperature thing - be honest with her otherwise it's a slippery slope to resentment.", "NTA. Tell her to spend a week showering in water that's a few degrees cooler than what SHE normally finds comfortable and see how she feels then. That's what she's asking you to do.", "You may be using the shower as your \"me time\" away from the stresses of everyday life. This would make sharing them problematic. The question is does your wife get any \"me time\" for herself? Sounds like she's pretty busy. I'd compromise on one shared shower per day or every second day. And look forward to it. It's an intimate thing to do with your partner and might be something you come to enjoy. Think about what you gain instead of what you lose and don't rush it.", "NTA. \n\nKeep the door locked.", "Dude. It might start off as cute to share showers but no. This isn't the way. Dont shower together period. You don't want another baby this soon and this shit on top of it. Couples therapy asap. Nta", "Nope NTA. Your wife is though if she keeps pushing this. If you like different shower temps you like different shower temps and shouldn't be sharing them for the most part. That would not be quality time for me. Cut your showers down a few minutes in the morning and have breakfast together. Or she gets ready in the bathroom while you have your shower and yall can still talk, etc.", "NTA for the showers together thing. Taking a 15-20 minute shower in the morning and 10 minutes at night is a lot of time to shower. Maybe cut it down and spend some extra time with her?", "NTA. She's saying compromise. But, what she means is do exactly what she wants (I'm married too, so I know). Then she's gotta take a shot at your because she didn't get exactly what she wants.", "NAH You both have legitimate views, and you haven't said or done horrible things to each other, so it's really a question of how you two want to proceed.", "maybe give up a shower to spend with your wife. esh", "NTA. Your wife is being an AH for not respecting your preference for water temperature. If you were insisting she bathe in the same temperature, you would be an AH but, you aren\u2019t. She created this issue and she needs to accept that you aren\u2019t going to change your routine.", "NAH. My hubs likes cool showers, I don't. If I'm in the shower first and he joins me, it's my temp, which is a degree above lava.  If he's in and I join him, it's his temp and I don't last long. \n\nYour wife is a little bit of an AH for bringing up your childhood. She said that to strike out at you when she didn't get her way. That's pretty shitty. \n\n\n\nIt's like music in the car, driver always chooses. \nDriver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cake hole.

So what do we do, find other ways for intimacy and together time. \n\nYou need to speak up about the baby comment you made in the beginning and tell her how you feel about shower time and find a different way to spend time together.", "NTA\n\nYou shower while she does her other bathroom things and vice versa. Now you're spending time together and nobody is having an unpleasant shower.\n\nIf you want to save money, stop showering twice a day! It's not good for your skin!", "NAH, on the shower thing, I love a hot showers too so I get where your coming from. However I do think you need to find a way to make a compromise with your wife so that you two can find some together time, and that should be on both your parts. Maybe Turing off the phones and TV and going to bed 20 mins earlier for some cuddle time, or  getting a baby sitter once every couple weeks for a night out just the two of you.  While I get your working toward a promotion, your wife is also working as well as taking care of a 6 month old at the same time. She has expressed that she needs some time to relax with you so she can feel connected to you and still feel like a couple. It's important you take this need of hers seriously.", "YTA. It's ridiculous to spend 3.5 hours in the shower every week. Your wife's suggestion to share showers and compromise on temperature is reasonable since you're extremely wasteful. \n\nYour wife just wants to spend time with you. If you're not willing to compromise on shower temperature, it's time you compromise on shower length.", "YTA. She actively trying to spend time with you because she loves you. You should compromise. Take one colder shower with her once a day, and take one hot shower alone once a day. This way both of you get what you wish for. Why are you acting like a toddler, expecting her to give up everything to accommodate you?\n\nAnd if you feel the second baby would be to soon, TALK TO HER ABOUT IT!  Express you are not comfortable with the second one yet, tell her your doubts and fears, she is your partner, you are there for each other as a team. Communicate, non of your can read the others mind!", "NTA", "Yeah, and \"playfully\" bringing up childhood trauma is plain ol' AH behavior.", "Ditto", "It\u2019s not N A H it\u2019s NTA because it\u2019s obvious their showers aren\u2019t compatible but the wife is forcing the issue anyway because she developed some fixation on it randomly. She\u2019s also TA for messing with the dial selfishly and frivolously bringing his childhood into it.", "NTA OP, couple showers are great if the couple enjoys it.  My husband and I often shower together but he agreed to let me control the temperature of the water.", "Compromising on temperature should imo only be a thing if both people want to share a shower. I personally wouldn\u2019t like to shower at a different temperature because someone else decided that they want to join me while I just want to shower in peace.", "I think it is weird that wanting to regulate an adults water temp is being discussed at all. If you think it is trauma, let it not be discussed cos you want something. That will come off as BS to anyone. \nOp likes it the way he likes it is his reason.\n\nAlso as an African who lives in Africa, we have very hot weather so bathing twice a day is very normal for us. And personally, as hot as the weather can be, I have had maaaaaany hot showers like Op described so...I need therapy too or just Op?", "There's an argument for one and done too.\n\nAnd\n\nThere's an argument for discussion on important life decisions with your partner", "Pretty sure [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPDLBEfAyQ4/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=) comic captures your temperature (in)compatability perfectly.", "Wow. Your wife wants some one-on-one time with you and you\u2019ve told her it\u2019s just not something that\u2019s important to you. Everything else is, work, your baby, your showers, but spending time with the woman you profess to love and making her feel valued, that doesn\u2019t rate a mention on your priority list. What support and comfort DO you offer your wife? \nSo far we\u2019ve got you reject her idea, and don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to spend time with her, and you over here wondering why she\u2019s upset.", "OP is wasteful and anybody who disagrees lacks perspective.\n\nI'm glad I'm child free since the water wars could begin this century.", "But it's so good for the soul.", "Whatever. It\u2019s also wonderful for your muscles and sinus congestion! Those of us who hell shower know and we don\u2019t care.", "Been taking super hot showers for almost 50 years. My skin is unwrinkled and my hip length hair is healthy. The steam is great for my skin, I don't even moisturize, and the heat feels amazing on my muscles.", "As someone who likes a shower so hot my bf has joked my father must be satan, I was also raised with the concept that washing MANDATES body lotion afterward. I probably have the best skin out of all my friends.", "I've done farm work, among other dirty jobs, while working out daily as well. \n\n30 minutes of showering per day is wasteful, period.", "NAH - a little bit of E S H on the side, but being new parents is tough so I'm giving some grace.  The idea of sharing a shower is clearly a non-starter, but your wife seems desperate to have some couples time together, which is actually a very good thing and puts you all ahead of many families at this stage of parenting.  If the shower doesn't work for you start coming up with some ideas of your own.  I don't know your schedule so won't even venture to guess, but get creative and show her that this goal is equally important to you.  \n\n  \nAlso as a random aside, unless you are doing some serious physical labor (working out or on the job) that is a bit of extra showering each day.  Given before and after shower prep that could easily amount to an hour a day and given how precious your time is right now you might want to rethink that use if possible.", "NTA but you need to find another way to spend time with her. Maybe don\u2019t shower for half an hour every day?", "Is nobody going to mention the utterly appalling waste of 30 minutes per day clean water going down the drain!!!\n\nYou use more water than our entire family. A lot more. Not to mention the enormous environmental (and power bill) impact of heating that huge amount of water up to that temperature.\n\nYou are an AH for that alone.", "TIL from this thread that there are people who genuinely take showers hot enough for their skin to turn red? I feel like that cannot be healthy.", "YTA - you are wasting water. Water is precious.", "NTA but really hot showers are bad for your skin", "NTA for the shower.\n\nBut do find time to spend together with her. Quality and intimate time (not necessarily sexual).\n\nYou spend 30 min a day showering, she spends the whole day with a baby a needs contact, she probably just thought this was the time to do so (set time and place), it's not.", "NTA. I like my showers barely above room temperature, the missus likes them way hotter than I like. We tried compromises on this but both ended up hating our showers. You\u2019re allowed to have your showers how you like them. Cuddle time isn\u2019t during bathing if neither of you don\u2019t like the results. That\u2019s how it goes sometimes.", "INFO: \n\ndoes any intimaticy happen or is it just talking, catching up, spending the time together? If the latter, why doesn't she just sit on the closed toilet seat and you guys can just chat?", "NTA\n\n\nAlso my 12 year old has never been bathed in scalding water. \n\nBut he just discovered on his own scalding showers and now I can't get him out from there. Sooo it happens naturally as well but I also like scalding showers.", "If you are taking a shower with someone, and the temperature you like it at causes the other person pain, it is the right thing to do to turn the temperature down. Don't cause your wife pain.   \nIf you don't want to shower with her, take it as hot as you want.", "Op you sure you not running away cause you don't want another one.\n\nBathrooms are private. 20 min is not long. Op and op wife should try to weasel out some time other than there.", "Yeah I hate cold showers. I will shower in lava if I can (exaggeration) but yes I understand, my fianc\u00e9e refuses to share a shower because he likes colder showers because he is a naturally very hot person. Our compromise? We don't shower together. I honestly just think your wife really really really wants to start on baby number 2\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 NAH she's not one either but maybe a little the AH because she brought up your childhood knowing you didn't like it. Very manipulative of her.", "NTA\n\nShe's an Ah for mentioning your childhood though.\n\nAnd this suggestion has nothing with the temperature, but maybe you both could take your showers separately only shorter- and then spend the remaining time together in the morning?", "You\u2019re NTA to anyone except your skin bro showers that hot are bad for your skin barrier", "NTA. Sounds like any compromise isn't going to be particularly relaxing for either of you. How about giving each other a massage before bed? Something that's relaxing but new.", "Nah. You don\u2019t need to compromise on shower temperature but if at all possible you should try to find time to spend with your wife instead.", "It\u2019s not a bonding time if one person is miserable. NTA", "NTA she is using childhood trauma against you? I wouldn\u2019t stay", "NTA. It won\u2019t kill you both to try it, but I\u2019m like you: I love a hot shower and given the choice, will choose one every time. Personally, I think if it\u2019s 15 min of \u201cus\u201d time you\u2019re seeking, I\u2019d look for it elsewhere. Schedule it in and make it a priority somewhere else: put the baby to sleep 10 min earlier, clean up the kitchen together and devote 15 min together delicately snuggles together in the couch. No TV, no phones. Just 15 minutes of dedicated, as-essential-as-dinner time in each other\u2019s arms, talking about your day and things you love about your life together.", "NTA, you are entitled to shower on your own at the temperature you prefer. Your wife is being aggressively needy and its really not fair.", "NTA,  my boyfriend takes showers like you & I take lukewarm showers... it'd be agitating AF for either one of us to shower together. I've tried taking scalding hot showers & it's horrible lol no offense. If she wants to be with you that bad, she can deal with your temperature.  \nSide note, if y'all have such little time together that you need to shower together for quality time, she needs to get rid of her baby fever.", "I seem to be on the NAH boat, I understand where your wife is coming from. I am a SAHM and it\u2019s lonely, and sometimes I would love to just be able to spend time with my husband with no interruptions but I would never want to make him uncomfortable just to spend time with me. \nI don\u2019t think you are an AH for not wanting to take cooler showers , but do think maybe you should take a quicker shower just so you can spent 5-10mins with your wife", "You need to deal with your self harming issues", "I shower with my partner 9 times out of 10, and he likes his showered HOT, even in the summer, and I like mine cooler. Our compromise is to just turn the water up or down when the other person is getting under the water. When we switch spots, we also change the water temp and it\u2019s honestly not even a bother", "I\u2019ve got a 1.5 yo and a 5mo and I still manage to see my husband out of the shower.\n\nI would be SO mad if someone invaded my solo shower time. Like just let me clean my bum in peace.", "Yeah OP definitely from a place where they don\u2019t need to worry about water supply or restrictions, or bills by the sound of it.", "Showering that much is also unhealthy for you as well as being unnecessary unless you have a condition that causes severe sweating or live in a ridiculously hot country.", "We\u2019re pretty economically conscious in other areas, but to us and this may not be the same for others, it\u2019s not that costly (roughly \u00a31 for both showers)", "You\u2019re doing the right thing :)", "Nope, it wasn\u2019t a nice shock to the system the first time!", "Wife is an AH because she tries to change his shower temperature when he\u2019s in it.", "By compromise, you mean OP has to do something that he doesn\u2019t like.\n\nFuck that.\n\nNTA", "Did she have to try and forcefully change his shower temperature while he was in it?", "Showering that hot is also bad for your skin.\n\nI don't think OP cares about his health, his bills, or the environment \ud83d\ude02", "That's even worse, I would never do that to my partner! I can understand the need to share moments with your partner but she is just imposing what SHE wants without taking into account your own wants and needs. Not cool.", "Showering helps with insulin absorption, it doesn\u2019t cost that much honestly, 10-minute shower costs between 32p and 49p based on the current price cap.\n\nThe environment may be something I should take into account.", "We know,   but a hot shower or bath is honestly so relaxing and great for the muscles,   that i'll put up with having to smother myself in heavy duty body cream after.  \n\nPlus for me, i have a severe pain condition and heat is the only thing that ever REALLY helps - i get so much pain relief from hot water and it's pure bliss.", "I didn\u2019t mean it like that, I\u2019d be more than happy to hire a babysitter once or twice a week. Not every morning.", "Mini? The first one is 15-20 minutes, and second for 10. Both too long.", "I\u2019m willing to bet your wife heard the same thing I did. That she just want important enough. \nYou\u2019ve got some communicating to do. She is clearly feeling neglected and lonely, time to do something.", "Have you told her that?"]}
