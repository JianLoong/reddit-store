My husband likes showers like you do, and I can barely stand it. When I (notice I say I, because if I am the one who wants to shower together, he shouldnt have to be uncomfortable) chose to compromise and shower with him, I stay out of the water, or use the water bouncing off of him, giving it a chance to cool down some.  Before any keyboard warriors out there come for me, it's a 2 way street. When he joins me in the shower, he knows the temp isn't going up much.\n\nI get your wife's point, but maybe there can be a compromise to the compromise. She could join you halfway through, stay out of the direct water, then finish her shower at her temperature after you are done.\n\nYou and your wife are trying to navigate one of the hardest times in a relationship. I wish you both the best.", "NTA\n\nYou two need to find what works for you but you for sure need your own time to relax and unwind.", "I would say NTA.  Having time together is important.  But your wife decided that sharing showers was the way to get some time with you, but didn't get any agreement from you.  Considering the temperatures that you both like, this just wouldn't work.  Who cares what the reason might be for you liking hot showers, that's irrelevant.  Sorry your time together is so short and hope that you find some way to be with each other.", "NAH.  My husband and I had all of these romantic ideas about couple showers when we first moved in together. I like my showers hot enough to make my skin red, and he likes them just above room temperature. One or both of us was always miserable, so we just don\u2019t shower together unless the mood is perfect and water temp doesn\u2019t matter. We found different ways to spend time together. I suggest you guys do the same.", "NTA. It\u2019s only relaxing if both of you enjoy it. And since you don\u2019t she needs to let it go. If it really stresses you out then she needs to drop the idea.", "NTA.  You guys need to figure out another way for couple time.   You also need to be honest with her if you are not yet ready for baby number 2.", "NTA. It's not a compromise to just do the thing she wants. There must be other ways to spend time together. Each day has 1440 minutes, and your showers are taking up 30 of those minutes or less.\n\nAlso, \"playfully\" doing something to your partner after they have said no is not \"playful\" it's rude (or worse).\n\nIt's worth talking to her about exactly what need she's trying to fill with this group shower idea, and then working together to find another way to fill that need.\n\nGood luck, OP. My guess is that there are larger issues at play here.", "Nta not a reasonable compromise to ask for imo. Shower temps are personal and a part of many peoples mandatory becoming a person routine. \n\nShe absolutely does deserve adult time! You two ABSOLUTELY need to find some time for being adults together, but morning showers aren\u2019t the time to do it.\n\nShe\u2019s the asshole for making it about your childhood.", "NTA, and maybe if you guys are this hard up for quality time she needs to cool it on planning for kid #2?\n\nPlenty of couples with a single six month old manage to spend time together without having to share a shower.", "NAH.  Showers together don't sound like such a hot idea.  Maybe you can carve out some other time together that doesn't require such a drastic compromise.", "Then just don't take showers together.", "NTA\n\nCouple showers are also overrated for this very reason. Plus they don't flow as smoothly as one thinks.", "NTA.  Why can't SHE compromise & take hot showers?", "NAH the suggested way to spend time together doesn\u2019t work and is causing conflict\u2026 have seperate showers\u2026", "NTA.\n\nPart of a relationship is accepting that there are some things you can\u2019t compromise about.  You don\u2019t form one combined homogenous blob.  The appropriate compromise here is that you like different showers, and just need your own space in the morning.  You have to agree to disagree.", "NTA. Should be a basic right of marriage to shower alone, at your preferred temperature, ya know? Just run for the bathroom screaming, \"I DO NOT CONSENT!\". But like, when I want to hang out with my husband while he's showering I just sit on the floor by the tub and ogle him around the shower curtain, while I tell him about my day. I *think* he likes it.", "NAH.  There have to be other ways to spend time with each other that you both like.  Showers are a very personal experience and if you don't like them the same way then it's just not going to be nice for both of you. I've never really understood recreational joint showers anyway - seems like someone is always either getting cold because they're not under the water or they're getting water in their eyes or something.  If you don't want the same thing then you need to find something else to be your thing and she shouldn't get hung up on wanting to shower with you. \nThat said - 15-20 minute showers???? That's a huge waste of water.  Shorter shower on your own and 15 minute coffee together sounds like the compromise to get some one on one time.  If you're not prepared to give up the shower time because it's your personal time (which is understandable, albeit expensive and environmentally unsustainable) then don't tell her it's because of the temperature thing - be honest with her otherwise it's a slippery slope to resentment.", "NTA. Tell her to spend a week showering in water that's a few degrees cooler than what SHE normally finds comfortable and see how she feels then. That's what she's asking you to do.", "You may be using the shower as your \"me time\" away from the stresses of everyday life. This would make sharing them problematic. The question is does your wife get any \"me time\" for herself? Sounds like she's pretty busy. I'd compromise on one shared shower per day or every second day. And look forward to it. It's an intimate thing to do with your partner and might be something you come to enjoy. Think about what you gain instead of what you lose and don't rush it.", "NTA. \n\nKeep the door locked.", "Dude. It might start off as cute to share showers but no. This isn't the way. Dont shower together period. You don't want another baby this soon and this shit on top of it. Couples therapy asap. Nta", "Nope NTA. Your wife is though if she keeps pushing this. If you like different shower temps you like different shower temps and shouldn't be sharing them for the most part. That would not be quality time for me. Cut your showers down a few minutes in the morning and have breakfast together. Or she gets ready in the bathroom while you have your shower and yall can still talk, etc.", "NTA for the showers together thing. Taking a 15-20 minute shower in the morning and 10 minutes at night is a lot of time to shower. Maybe cut it down and spend some extra time with her?", "NTA. She's saying compromise. But, what she means is do exactly what she wants (I'm married too, so I know). Then she's gotta take a shot at your because she didn't get exactly what she wants.", "NAH You both have legitimate views, and you haven't said or done horrible things to each other, so it's really a question of how you two want to proceed.", "maybe give up a shower to spend with your wife. esh", "NTA. Your wife is being an AH for not respecting your preference for water temperature. If you were insisting she bathe in the same temperature, you would be an AH but, you aren\u2019t. She created this issue and she needs to accept that you aren\u2019t going to change your routine.", "NAH. My hubs likes cool showers, I don't. If I'm in the shower first and he joins me, it's my temp, which is a degree above lava.  If he's in and I join him, it's his temp and I don't last long. \n\nYour wife is a little bit of an AH for bringing up your childhood. She said that to strike out at you when she didn't get her way. That's pretty shitty. \n\n\n\nIt's like music in the car, driver always chooses. \nDriver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cake hole.

We wouldnt be having those 2-3 sacred hours after bedtime. If we had another baby right now we wouldn't get any time alone. The last 6 or so months have been such an easy part of this crazy ride.

She might see the shower as her only \"free and relaxing\" time as a lot of new moms do sometimes. she could  be feeling more isolated from you as a baby gets alot more time with the mom then the dad during the first year. have a sit down talk where you both talk about how your feeling and what you both can do. \n\nAlso make sure to celebrate her body, it created and carried your child and more then likely she is possibly having some body issues (I don't know how she gave birth but it does put a huge strain on the body mentally and physically) and be sure to check on her mental health, postpartum depression is a very serious condition and should never be taken likely, as it can last up to a year or longer but if you or her is concerned about it they can start screening around 6 months postpartum. \n\nCongratulations on your kid and i do hope the best for you, give us an update to let us know how it goes", "My husband and I are the opposite ( I don\u2019t even turn on the cold water it\u2019s just straight hot), he says he rather not shower in lava.
