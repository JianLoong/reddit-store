They both got new phones back over the summer.\n\nI called my ex, told him the phones are messing up, and the kids need new ones. At first he just wanted to look into fixing the ones they already had, but the iPhone 14 has come out since the phones they have now and both of our kids have been wanting that. I told my ex not to worry about those phones as the kids want the new iPhone and instead to buy them newer iPhones and make sure he gets the deal so they can have new iPads too, as they'd love to be surprised by that.\n\nMy ex accused me of being unreasonable and said if he can get their current phones fixed they should be fine, as they've only had those phones 6 months. As for the iPads he pointed out that they do have iPads that are less than 2 years old. I told him this is what our kids want and it would make them very happy to receive both items. After that the conversation became heated with us yelling at each other and ended with me telling my ex he's not allowed to contact me or the kids until he gets those items for them. (It wouldn't be a large amount of money up front, instead just a little extra to his phone bill each month, which is very easy for him to pay and the kids are already on his phone plan.)\n\nI know our kids would be so thrilled to be surprised with news iPhones and iPads as they use the ones they currently have daily. My ex feels I'm being unreasonable as they have perfectly good but older iPads and their phones aren't old but need to be looked at to figure out what's wrong. When we've argued in the past and it's gotten heated I've blocked my ex on mine and the kids devices until I felt like I could deal with my ex again, I'm on the verge of doing that because he's sent me multiple texts over the past few hours telling me I'm being ridiculous, unrealistic, materialistic and just putting me down as a person.\n\nAITA?\n\nPlease note: BOTH OF THE KIDS ARE UNDER 18!!!", "created_utc": 1673154561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106ai3s/aita_for_wanting_my_kids_get_new_phones/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I keep my phones for as many years as possible.

You can't even provide that!\n\nThe phones are new. The ipads are new. You ask him to blow a huge amount of money because 'that is what the kids wants'. He is not putting you down as a person. You put yourself down. You asked him to blow up money 'so the kids aka me will be happy otherwise we won't talk ever again' that is a threat. You threaten him until you get what you want.\n\nIf your kids needs at least 2k to feel happy for five months you should question it. Or this is what you want and not what the kids want? And he is not allow to contact the kids unless he blows that amount of money for something that is not a necessity ? Do you really want him to go to court again? Or you want your kids to not have a father because they didn't get new iPads?\n\nAlso you won't be the judge of what amount of money he can spend out of his own pocket to fill in your materialistic needs. Because I don't see you contributing at all. Not even saying 'hey get the phone for one of them and I will get the other one' nope. Just spend it. And spend more cause they wants iPads because they are less than 2 year old. A device that is meant to be used for at least 5! You just want him to spend the money cause the kids...want it? Like what? You give to your kids anything they want? and if you do that is a you problem, and you should have the money for your materialistic and out of touch needs. Not him. Because let's be honest. two phones that are less than six months old must have dealt with abuse to not faction! and they have the previous model. It would be easy FOR YOU for the kids to have the new model that came two months after they got their new phones.\n\nSo maybe just maybe stop lying and admit that your kids ruined their phones on purpose to get the new ones. And that you blackmail their father into getting them for you by withholding parental communication. Stop acting like he is the only villain in this story because he is not and you know it. And you came here to justify your vile actions", "YTA Don't get children what they want just becuase they have asked for it - especially when its not your fucking money.\n\n You are being hugely manipulative over something so petty.

Like others have said, the phones are less than 6 months old, they can be fixed. As for the iPads? They are less than 2 yrs old, they are still supported by Apple for iOS updates. They don\u2019t need them. To make matters worse you are extorting their father, by not letting him see his own children until he provides these items. AH", "YTA\n\nYour ex is right. Replacing iPhones after only six months? For real? Without even having them looked at to see if it\u2019s a straightforward fix? Wasteful, foolish, materialistic\u2026 yep, sounds right.\n\n> After that the conversation became heated with us yelling at each other and ended with me telling my ex he's not allowed to contact me or the kids until he gets those items for them.\n\nSeriously? Seriously? You threatened to block all of his contact with the kids unless he buys them brand new phones? For your sake, I hope you didn\u2019t put any of that in a text because that\u2019s not going to look good if you ever have to go to court for custody issues.

If they are unhappy with the model or how much storage they have then they can get a job and buy a new one.\n\nIf the phone is acting up then bring it to the store and get them fixed. Its way cheaper, especially if they only have them for around six months. How are you contributing to the new devices? Are you paying for any of it?\n\nI think its fucked up to block your ex-husband and to block the children from their father because you're cranky they aren't getting new shit when they don't need it. \n\nYTA", "YTA, you don\u2019t get to tell your ex how to spend money on the kids you share. If the phones can be fixed, they should be fixed, especially if that\u2019s how the person paying for them wants to do things. They also have functioning iPads, what happens to those?", "YTA. I spoil my kid, and I'm still disgusted here. You are incredibly entitled. So, what, you think he should just waste the 2k he spent 6 months ago to get them top of the line phones? Seriously? Are you sure you're the parent and not the teenager here?", "Sorry yta\nWhen they get jobs they can buy better products,  its really not his problem", "YTA. There\u2019s easier ways to go about this.\n\nDoes your ex have phone insurance? Get new phones that way. Or, like he said, just get them fixed. \n\nYour kids don\u2019t need to have the newest and fanciest things all the time. 2 year old iPads are nothing. You realize there\u2019s grandparents out there with the second iPhone and not complaining, right? Their phones are 6 months old for crying out loud. Teach them some patience and how to be grateful.\n\nAdditionally, you have no right to speak on someone\u2019s financial status if you can\u2019t afford to get them new phones. \u201cIt\u2019ll only be a few bucks to his phone bill at the end of the month.\u201d So you know what his finances are like *entirely*? How his car is? If he\u2019s saving up for anything? No? Then you don\u2019t get to say it\u2019s a couple of bucks to his bill because to some people that means a lot. \n\nYour kids can wait til the next new iPhone comes out since they apparently need the newest things (unless it\u2019s just you who likes to parade their new things around). I got my 14 pro for $250 after trading my 11 pro in.

Your ex is right. Get the phones they have looked at, and if there IS something wrong, they are likely under warranty and will be replaced.  It\u2019s more likely the kids just want the new model and are exaggerating the issues they are having to get what they want.  This makes sense since I\u2019d bet you have raised your children to be the same entitled brats that you clearly are.  Do better.", "Must be nice to have this kind of money to spend frivolously.

Your ex bought the last phones - why don't YOU pony up the funds and buy your precious kids the new phones?  YOU want them to have them so bad - YOU pay for them.   I bet in 6 months when they want new ones again you won't be so quick to say they need them and tell the kids to take better care of their stuff. \n\nYou are also being very immature in blocking you ex from his children unless he gives in - I hope that is against the parenting plan and he hauls you entitled butt to court over this, and I'm sure, MANY other things.

Since when does a 6 month old iPhone need to be replaced?! I get that the phones are acting up, but could it be possible that since your kids are clearly very privileged and living with you as an example- they may also be aware that if they want something bad enough, they have a mommy who will throw a tantrum and demand it be provided to them? \u201cThe new iPhone 14 is out, let\u2019s overload these phones, do all the things we know we shouldn\u2019t do-and get the iPhone 14, complain to her and make sure she knows about the iPad deal\u201d. Seriously, at 6 months old what are the odds that BOTH of their phones are acting up in the same exact way? They likely learned these manipulative, entitled behaviors from you based off of how you are interacting with your ex. Your kids need to learn to take care of stuff. They are not learning to respect belongings and the hard work that goes into making money to afford things, and you are not allowing your ex to teach them those valuable lessons either.

From how you\u2019re acting, it sounds like they\u2019re learning to be a spoiled leach. I have a sneaky suspicion that you \u201cwant\u201d them to grow up mature and be respectful of their belongings, but you can\u2019t resist a good opportunity to exert control over your ex, watch him bend to your will and take as much away from him as possible\u2026.am I right?

They both got new phones back over the summer.\n\nI called my ex, told him the phones are messing up, and the kids need new ones. At first he just wanted to look into fixing the ones they already had, but the iPhone 14 has come out since the phones they have now and both of our kids have been wanting that. I told my ex not to worry about those phones as the kids want the new iPhone and instead to buy them newer iPhones and make sure he gets the deal so they can have new iPads too, as they'd love to be surprised by that.\n\nMy ex accused me of being unreasonable and said if he can get their current phones fixed they should be fine, as they've only had those phones 6 months. As for the iPads he pointed out that they do have iPads that are less than 2 years old. I told him this is what our kids want and it would make them very happy to receive both items. After that the conversation became heated with us yelling at each other and ended with me telling my ex he's not allowed to contact me or the kids until he gets those items for them. (It wouldn't be a large amount of money up front, instead just a little extra to his phone bill each month, which is very easy for him to pay and the kids are already on his phone plan.)\n\nI know our kids would be so thrilled to be surprised with news iPhones and iPads as they use the ones they currently have daily. My ex feels I'm being unreasonable as they have perfectly good but older iPads and their phones aren't old but need to be looked at to figure out what's wrong. When we've argued in the past and it's gotten heated I've blocked my ex on mine and the kids devices until I felt like I could deal with my ex again, I'm on the verge of doing that because he's sent me multiple texts over the past few hours telling me I'm being ridiculous, unrealistic, materialistic and just putting me down as a person.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Yta.", "YTA. How dare you attempt to blackmail him by threatening to withhold access to his kids? I hope he takes you to court.", "YTA. Your kids do not need new phones and iPads so soon, especially not badly enough to demand such or your ex. If their current phones are acting up, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to just fix them/use a warranty. Not only are you being unreasonable and materialistic, but you\u2019re teaching your kids to be the same way.\n\nYour ex shouldn\u2019t be expected to buy unnecessary expensive new devices just because the kids want them. Kids want a lot of things, but it\u2019s important for them to know they can\u2019t always immediately get what they want without work. It won\u2019t kill them to wait for tech upgrades (or work/pay for them), especially not if part of the issue is not taking care of products (and I suspect that\u2019s the case with the phones).", "Omg you're a nightmare & an AH.", "YTA. Full stop. I usually try to err on the side of looking at things from the kids\u2019 perspectives and whether the poster is trying to show empathy in that direction. But I have to agree with your ex.

You don't like that, buy them yourself. Don't have the money? Then I guess the kids don't need the new phones.\n\nBlocking someone because you don't like being told no? You're co-parenting.

Your fault.", "Even if the 14 year olds request her to be a SAHM they\u2019re old enough to understand that their mum can\u2019t just leech off of their dad.\n\nIf they go to school and she goes of to work there may be a few hours in between them getting home from school and her getting home from work but by not even being able to provide anything they need by herself but still staying at home because of child support she\u2019s going to give them a warped sense of reality", "We divorced 5 years ago, my ex was quick to move on from his real family to his current wife.", "DA, that's not how it works, he can't trade in basically brand new phones for other brand new phones without having to pay the difference unless he wants to screw up his credit", "You're weird blocking him from talking to his kids because he doesn't want to get them new phones after already having them for 6 months.  \nI hope he doesn't do it, and personally, he should go to the courts and let them know this is how you operate.  \nYou pay to get them the new phones. You're so entitled, and it's disgusting.", "That isn't how it works. He has to fully pay off the old phones before he could get new phones. If he couldn't afford to buy them outright 6 months ago, then he likely can't when they still have 18 more months of payments. So, you can pay off their current phones to allow fir an upgrade, or you can get the current ones fixed. I suggest you let the kids know before they damage them beyond repair that they are stuck with these for 18 more months, because even damaged beyond repair they can't get an upgrade until those are paid off. There are no discounts or ways around it.", "My oldest is not yet 18", "Not even just that she should be lucky he's actually providing for the youngest because it's not his child. You definitely are entitled, and you need to chill before he stops taking care of the youngest because of your shenanigans.", "The youngest (who has to be 13-14) isn't even the ex-husband's kid. He currently pays $4000/month child support and says he will until the oldest (his actual kid) turns 18 (which I'm assuming is this year.) Once the oldest is 18, deadbeat mom gets cut off. He'll still provide for the basic needs for the youngest directly but won't give another cent to his ex. So the deadbeat ex wants to take him to court to keep having him pay HER income until the affair baby is 18.\n\nOh, and he's also paying for the medical insurance, college, phone plan, etc. for both children. \n\nShe has no plan for what she's going to do after her gravy train is cut off because she refuses to get a job.", "Cuz you cheated", "You\u2019re gross. It\u2019s not his \u201creal family\u201d just because you had him first. And it must not have been very real to you since you fucked someone else while you were with him.", "Oh she says he'll have to pay more oh and by the way also get new iPads. She'd like to give the old iPads, that I'm sure she didn't pay for, to her other family members. I feel so sorry for OPs Ex.", "Not weird. Spiteful, wrong, awful, unhinged and most likely breaking the law. Weird is not how I\u2019d describe this person at all, but I\u2019d get banned for saying what she really is."]}
