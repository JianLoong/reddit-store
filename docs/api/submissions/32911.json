And that is not fair towards you.", "Ugh.  I'm sick of people injecting their insecurities into personally reflective comments.\n\nShe's uptight because you're losing weight and she isn't.  So she's hoping you'll stay fat and miserable with her because it's too much work for her to lose it with you.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNTA", "NAH you made a comment without knowing it would hurt her feelings so you\u2019re not an asshole.\nShe can\u2019t control what hurts her feelings so she\u2019s not an asshole.

That's sad and torturous but it is not your fault, nor is it your responsibility to manage. She needs to go to a therapist. You are allowed to have an opinion about your own body.

In many ways, it is literally a matter of life or death. Being that overweight is going to significantly reduce her lifespan. The fact that she's offended shows she's touchy about that because she knows it's bad, even though you didn't know her weight.", "Gross bro. All of this. Jesus.", "She's a fattie", "YTA - obviously your wife is sensitive about her weight, at least that is what I gleamed, insinuating that you getting to her weight and that is too much is just goofy AF.", "NTA - you have every right to express yourself", "NTA-\n\nEvery body is different,200 pound you will look entirely different on her 200 pound body,weight is also to do with our height,my weight rage for my height is 7stone-9 stone 6 pounds but for people taller than me their healthy weight could be 8stone-10 stone 5 pounds.\n\nYou did not mean to offend her,she has weight issues that she should possibly go to therapy for to help her with her emotions and on how to help her with her insecurities.", "NTA because she seems to have brought it up and started talking about your weight first, but in general one should avoid commenting negatively about their own weight around heavier people.  The implications are pretty obvious!", "She\u2019s said that jokingly so there may be a small layer of truth. However, I do see her *trying* to lose weight and I do feel bad for her that losing weight seems to come easier for me.", "Saw this happen with a buddy whose wife didn't like the idea of him working out, while she herself actively worked out.

She isn't gaining weight from breathing air. She's gaining it by eating food. It comes easier to you because you're better at not eating as much/being hungry for 10 seconds without succumbing to eating.\n\nIf she's truly fattening you up, that's horrid behaviour.\nSomeone has to give her the cold hard facts on weight loss.
