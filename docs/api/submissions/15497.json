I\u2019d planned this out separately to my other siblings as I wanted to spend time alone with them, and my sister (30f) had recently visited so it felt like perfect timing to go alone and get some quality time in.\n\nI didn\u2019t specifically do it to avoid her, we just don\u2019t get along always, as with a lot of siblings out there. I let her know my plans a couple of weeks before, and she started arranging things to come on holiday at the same time. I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t thrilled, but it\u2019s okay. I was just a little bit down as we butt heads on a lot of things, and we both have a short fuse with each other, so I knew we\u2019d inevitably argue at some point. \n\nWe\u2019ve been on holiday for three days now, and she\u2019s been less than pleasant. Always making off hand comments, ordering me around.. silly petty things like don\u2019t eat that, you cant order that, no we can\u2019t go there because I don\u2019t want to etc. I\u2019ve been just ignoring it so far, but it built up quite a lot and I answered back this morning. \n\nShe was suggesting an onion dish that we should have for Sunday dinner, and it was something im really not into. Fine with me! I opted to have a different pasta dish to the rest of my family, no problem. However as soon as my sister found out what I would be eating, she said it was unfair and selfish because she couldn\u2019t eat both. This ticked me off since she had suggested something she knew I didn\u2019t like, and was now complaining that I was eating a different dish that she also liked. I suggested she had half and half, and she came back and told me \u2018it\u2019s not my fault you don\u2019t like anything\u2019. \n\nSounds offhand but that was the final straw, after all the other petty wind up comments, and (unfortunately) in front of everyone I clapped back with \u2018this was supposed to be MY holiday. I am the one who is supposed to be on holiday\u2019. \n\nMy family went quiet, and my sister stormed out. My mom told me I shouldn\u2019t have said it, and my partner said I said the quiet thing out loud. Later on my family told me she had been winding them up too, but I shouldn\u2019t have said it.\n\nMy sister is now upset and not speaking to anyone, and has said we won\u2019t visit at the same time anymore. She said she would come at Christmas, insinuating I would no longer be able to come. I\u2019m definitely visiting my family at Christmas, and things like this won\u2019t stop me.\n\nI just need to know if I am the asshole. My mom is really upset which is making me think I went too far.

Seems to me like your sister likes to be the victim. I have siblings too (I'm the youngest), and there always seems to be a victim in the pack (I was a villain).", "NTA. She pushed and pushed and pushed. When you  fought back, she couldn\u2019t handle it. Tough luck princess. She has no right to insinuate you cannot come on Christmas. You are not there to see her. Ignore her.", "Nta. It sounds like she was doing this specifically to wind you up.", "NTA. Let her have her pity party. Another control freak who can\u2019t stand being confronted on their actions. Your family is avoiding confrontation, which is why they don\u2019t want you to say anything, but your sister is the one in the wrong here.", "What am I missing here? Your sister keeps picking away at you publicly, and you eventually say that this was supposed to be YOUR vacation. Your mother said you 'went too far' and some have responded with E S H. I don't think you did anything out of line. A person who constantly belittles you publicly does not deserve the courtesy of a quiet word on the side. You stated the truth and your sister couldn't handle the truth. Her problem - it should not be yours. NTA!", "NTA. Why is she like this?\n\n>Later on my family told me she had been winding them up too, but I shouldn\u2019t have said it.\n\nThere's my answer.\n\n>My mom is really upset\n\nYou dared to speak up when the family policy is to let her get away with anything.", "NTA, your older sister sounds like my two sisters: stupidly petty.\n\nIf she wanted both, she could have made both? She's an adult. And if she just visited family and immediately came back right when you were? Again, stupidly petty.", "NTA. Your response isn\u2019t even that harsh.", "Take some time away from each other. Do you all have to spend every second together? Next time, plan your own holidays. Don't even say a word to her. She seems like she's gatecrashed it for the drama. \n\nSounds like she's the one everyone walks on eggshells around. There is one in every family. \n\nNTA.", "NTA! I would type more but I\u2019m blinded by that shiny spine.", "NTA\n\nShe seems like she was hoping to get a response from you while in front of family to aggravate the situation.

Your sister needed to be called out earlier by everyone, including you, though.", "Not the asshole. \n\nSometimes the quiet thing needs said aloud.", "It was so nice for your sister to make the decisions for you. /s \r\n\nShe pushed your buttons. Repeatedly. Was your clap-back rude? Probably, partially depends on the exact tone of delivery. Was it an AH move, nope.", "NTA. Visit your partners family at Christmas and avoid this toxic woman permanently.", "Definitely NTA.  Your family has their head in the sand. They want the appearance of pleasantness, so they put up with her bullying and look to you to suffer so they don't have to address it.  Your parents are weak in this aspect of life.  It is entirely acceptable for them to say \"I love you but no, you will not behave this way\".  But this isn't their way and now inertia has taken over and they continue to perpetrate their offenses of omission.  \n\nYou absolutely should have said what you said.   You are staking a claim to being treated like the way you should be treated, which is as a fully formed adult.  You have a right to exist, and have the meals you want.  I mean, she is 30, and still talking about you eating a meal you like \"isn't fair\"? Who the heck talks about fairness like that at 30?  Maybe someone that is still fighting a battle that she didn't win when she was 10? \n\nYou are unfortunately in co-dependency.  Just because your mom is upset, doesn't mean you are wrong.  That was true when you were 3.  But not now.  Let her be upset.  Of course she will be upset, she can't count on you to just be small, and take less for her sake.  This is her problem to fix, not yours.  And her mind will want to make it about you being wrong unless she goes to therapy to see that you aren't wrong, you are simply being an adult.  And your mind will start to wonder because we have unconscious beliefs that our parents know more than us and they are probably right...until we reexamine them and realize they are just some people that showed up first and they are just as wrong as the rest of us.\n\nFinally, you need to put your sister on an information diet.  She didn't  come home to have a great time with you, she came home to do battle like she always does.  She came home to make sure your parents pick her over you because she is immature, and insecure.  And it might stem all the way back to when she was 6 and you just showed up and they didn't do enough to make sure she felt important and loved.  Or maybe they did all they could but she just wouldn't accept it.  But definitely you are NTA.", "\u201cmy partner said I said the quiet thing out loud\u201d\n\nI find this line hilarious lmao.

Sounds like people put up with her crap so they don't have to deal with her tantrums. Sounds like they've all made an overbearing monster. It's time someone stood up to her.", "You're NTA for not rocking the boat. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/77w8lf/dont_rock_the_boat/", "I don't understand how so many groups get into the dynamic where one person is allowed to be a constant asshole and if anyone else says even the slightest word, which you really didn't say anything particularly bad here, they're the bad person. \n\nNTA. You probably need to just go home. I wouldn't be bothering with trying to deal with this don't rock the boat nonsense on my holiday.", "Nta and your family doesn't get to guilt you for her overreaction. Your sister doesn't get to decide what you eat, what you do, how you act etc you're both grown adults and it's your vacation, you should be allowed to eat what you want and do what you want.", "If she's not speaking to you, take the win. Order your food, go on your trips, enjoy the holiday as you wanted, and if she happens to see you enjoying yourself despite being in a grump, so be it. Your family shouldn't be pandering to her either, but I assume she has always been the difficult personality and its been easier to correct you, than it is to correct her.

Grey rock your sister. If you want a quiet trip to visit your parents then just don\u2019t tell her. Don\u2019t give her the chance to interfere.", "NTA\n\nYour sister seems too pushy and doesn't respect other people's boundaries.
