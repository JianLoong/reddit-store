As owners of larger breeds we should respect that not everyone has to feel comfortable around our animals and a family bond doesn\u2019t overshadow that fact and neither do our hurt feelings. Sweet or mean a large breed can hurt a toddler who has just gotten their legs under them and is exploring, especially a new place and what the dogs consider their territory.

Please don\u2019t risk it", "Can I just ask what do you mean \"indoor dogs\" are the dogs ever outside? Or walked? I only ask for clarification because rottis are a large breed that require daily exercise and mental stimulation. When big dogs don't get this. Frustration sets in and that's the breeding ground for a dog attack. So depending on the circumstances I'd say you are right to be concerned. I've owned and been round many powerful breeds of dogs and whenever I hear \"indoor dogs\" it gives me an eye twitch because it's an accident waiting to happen.", "NTA however teach your toddler that there's no need to be scared of most dogs but that dogs always need to be approached with caution. teach your child how to approach a dog properly and how to interact with it properly. too many parents just allow their children to run up to dogs and touch them. our great dane cross (70lbs) was better with our babies/toddlers than our smaller dogs so often the size is less of a factor in determining risk.", "NTA. This is not an unreasonable request. Just because they're very sweet doesn't mean they're good around toddlers, who tend to pull tails & ears and pet roughly.", "YTA \n\nYou are responsible for your kid.

Those dogs took it so well, but I was taught better after that first incident but nonetheless loved them lots. \n\nI think your mom is right, but I think it also sounds like lack of training on her end so I wouldn\u2019t really risk it either especially if they\u2019re knocking her down.", "You\u2019d never be the 4$$hole for this! Keeping your child safe and comfortable is paramount. If she takes umbrage then let her. She sounds difficult to deal with if she cannot be reasonable in your request and let\u2019s not forgot this is her grandson you\u2019re talking about - she shouldn\u2019t take offence at all.", "NTA\n\nSo much can go wrong in this scenario.

Accidents happen , a kid can trip fall into the dog , and the dog feels it\u2019s being attacked . It will bite the kid right in the face .

We exercise him properly and socialise him. He is an absolute delight with children. So is my neighbour's Dogue de Bordeaux which is a massive beast compared to mine or a rottie. My friends have an indoor Malamute and the same properly exercised and socialised. My friend's rottie was an absolute champ, so big but so gentle with everything smaller than him, they had a tiny cat that loved to sleep under his chin with her head in his mouth and he wouldn't move an inch just so he doesn't wake her up. So yeah indoor dogs can be exercises, trained and socialised perfectly with other creatures \ud83e\udd37\nMy guess is that if they have two indoor rotties and still have a roof over their head (them or the house haven't been chewed to non-existance) they are properly exercised and trained", "your dog sounds lovely, and the way you teach him seems gentle and firm at the same time. \n\nHowever, OP said the dogs have thrown her mother on the floor.
