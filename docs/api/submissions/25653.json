It\u2019s over. \n\nYour wife has physically and emotionally moved on, your children are forgetting you and you aren\u2019t even the primary male under your own roof.\n\nYou\u2019ve been beyond foolish and through your stupidity have destroyed your marriage and your relationship with your kids. You\u2019ve failed as a man. Do everyone a favour and get a divorce ASAP.", "What a fucking mess. This is on you. When you married your wife, becoming a seafarer away for months at a time wasn't part of the deal. I know how much they get paid, so also know despite your assertion,  this had nothing yo do with money and everything yo do with your selfish needs. You abandon your wife and kids, and expect everything to be about you when you come home. Life doesn't work that way sweetie, you can't have your cake and eat it too. YTA", "No George isn't replacing you. You're an absent husband and father. This is a whole bizarre mess. \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nThis is a lot more complicated than just asking your wife to break up with her boyfriend. You've made a career choice that negatively impacts the integrity of your family. You opened up your marriage without setting up proper boundaries. Communication is the key to any open relationship, and it seems like you and your wife don't do much of that because you don't even know if her extracurricular relationships are sexual or not. I'm in a long term open relationship myself, and communication is the sole reason it works.\n\nHad you not opened the relationship, it seems like your marriage would've ended before too long. The distance was straining things, and your wife has moved on to someone who can be present in her family's life, physically and emotionally. You prioritized your own wellbeing over your family's by taking a job that makes you happier, but doesn't allow you to be present in their lives. Wanting to maintain control on the situation after already removing yourself? That's absurd.\n\nAlso, c'mon dude...don't expect anyone to take your side when you call your wife \"hysterical\" meanwhile you're a 32 year old upset about someone moving his toy collection.", "If this story is true:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"but I knew this was the right decision for me and my family. \" .. it was the short time right decission for you. But not for your wife and your kids. YOu abandoned them, and they found someone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Any suggestions?\" ... Next time, do better. With your next family. Or go back to see - they all love you as long as you are gone and far away. They don't know you in a different way, because you abandoned them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My heart is so broken and I just miss my kids, man.\" .. THIS is ridiculous. You abandoned them for years, and you don't even know them.", "YTA. You took that job knowing your wife opposed it, knowing her needs would be unmet. We reap what we sow.", "YTA. Both in the story, and (because it\u2019s clearly made up) in real life too. C minus for \u201ccreative\u201d writing.", "Mix- I can see why she wouldn\u2019t dump the dude she\u2019s been with for a year. They got too close and the validation you gave him probably only helped them. Boundaries should have been in place at the start of opening the marriage to include relationships. You\u2019ve been away for a while, your kids have been bonded to the man that was around. It sucks, and I get feeling hurt by it but it\u2019s also unfair to expect her to drop him after all he\u2019s done for them. My advise is find a job that keeps you home and file for divorce. Attempt family therapy with the kids so they can be reintroduced to you being around more often and to help y\u2019all navigate moving forward. I know you may love her but dragging it out and making it more messy by trying to go back to what it was, isn\u2019t worth it. And it may lead to words that you or she can\u2019t take back. I am sorry it didn\u2019t go the way you had imagined it, but the best thing you can do is be there for the kids. Embrace the new dude, annoying but it\u2019ll only hurt the kids if you don\u2019t. Just be there, at the end of the day whats done is done and although it may hurt like hell. The sooner you start to work on things the better, the longer you\u2019re away the more distant the kids will feel. I hope it all works out, and I wish you the best of luck.", "WTF?\n\nOpen relationships usually don't work.", "NTA I can't believe he did that to ur funky pops bro... sadistic narcissist tbh divorce immediately hit the gym", "Esh.  I say this as a wife of a merchant seaman who is gone at lest half the year.  The life is not for everyone and you NEED to be a strong person to cope with life at home and effectively being a single parent part of the year.\n\nThis should have been discussed as a family prior to taking the job and if it was a deal breaker for her then she should have left the marriage.  In 15yrs I have never been tempted but I appreciate growing up in a military town and a military family I had more experience than most in knowing what I was signing up for when o got with my husband.  Unlike the armed forces there is no support network for merchant families (or non that I  have found).", "NTA - but neither is your wife.
