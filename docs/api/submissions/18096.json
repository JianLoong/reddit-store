It\u2019s not the best but it\u2019s not the worst. She met a guy named Riley (33M) and they hit it off so well that he proposed to her 3 months after they started dating. Our parents thought it was too sudden but they left them alone because they\u2019re grown and can make their own decisions.\n\nAnyway, my sister and Riley have decided to go vegan. Cool, don\u2019t really care. Only issue I have is that they try to incorporate it into nearly every conversation we have. They have somewhat boring personalities so I guess they needed SOMETHING to make their personality about but it\u2019s ok.

I wasn\u2019t a fan though.\n\nI confronted my sister and Riley and asked what was up with all the vegan food. They said they wanted to \u201cpresent a different lifestyle to the guests\u201d and joked about \u201csteering them away from meat\u201d. I was pretty disgusted ngl. That sounded rude. I snapped back and said \u201cif I did the same thing to you guys but with meat, how would you react? Stop being so inconsiderate and learn to cater to your guests\u201d. \n\nShe told me if I had a problem with it, then \u201cthe door is to the left and I don\u2019t need to look back\u201d. I laughed and said there was no way she was kicking me out over me calling them out. She shrugged then walked away. Riley called me entitled and said I ruined what was supposed to be a special day. I sighed and left. That same night, I got a phone call from my dad that my sister was in tears. He told me I should\u2019ve acted my age and focused on my sister and her new husband, not the food. My mom also texted that my behaviour was shameful and that I wasn\u2019t raised to be judgemental of people\u2019s life choices.\n\nI immediately felt bad. I kept thinking about it. I couldn\u2019t sleep at night because I kept replaying the confrontation in my head. I was just sick of all this vegan crap being forced on me and I was \u201changry\u201d. AITA?\n\nEdit: Holy, ofc I don\u2019t eat meat every single day. I was just hungry and in the mood for some that day and when I saw the food and it was all vegan and looked like shit, I noped out.

In general you make unnecessary jabs at her (the personality comment) and don\u2019t seem to even care much about her (almost didn\u2019t go??).

She told us she couldn't get any of the vegetarian items because they were all gone. I looked towards the table and see them still there. So I said that I see there were some left and I walk over there with her. She said she liked fruit salad but wouldn't be able to eat this one because it was \"vegan\". I explained it was just normal fruit from the grocery store that I had cut and mixed together. She again said that it was with the vegan stuff so it must be a \"vegan\" fruit salad.\n\nI honestly could not believe the conversation we were having. I finally told her I was sure I had more fruit salad prepared in the fridge in the kitchen. She got excited and filled up a bowl with the kitchen fruit salad.

I eat plenty of meat, but there are some amazing vegan dishes out there.\n\nThis. I've been invited to 3 different weddings since becoming an adult, all since I went vegan. The first one had nothing I could eat. Either meat, eggs, or butter on everything. I sucked it up and celebrated the couple and ate when I got home. I did kind of expect it. That's part of life with a specific diet. If I am not prepared to feed myself, there are going to be times where I don't eat. \n\nThe second I was best man and they made sure that the caterer and the restaurant for the rehearsal dinner had vegan options. It was generally delicious. I very much appreciated the thought and time that they spent doing that work for me. \n\nThe third also knew I was vegan, though I was simply invited. Not part of the wedding party. So they did ask the questions, and somewhere in the planning the rehearsal dinner got missed, so the kitchen literally threw something together for me more than just a salad. It wasn't the best or what I was in the mood for, but I appreciated the efforts and enjoyed the food as much as I could. \n\nAnd yes, second that point about missing out on some really great foods by turning nose up at vegan. mmmmmm sweet potato quesadilla...\n\nI get that OP's sister is on the preachier end of the vegan spectrum, and that OP is likely resistant in general to it right now because he's still too busy resisting the push from the sister.
