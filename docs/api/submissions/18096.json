It\u2019s not the best but it\u2019s not the worst. She met a guy named Riley (33M) and they hit it off so well that he proposed to her 3 months after they started dating. Our parents thought it was too sudden but they left them alone because they\u2019re grown and can make their own decisions.\n\nAnyway, my sister and Riley have decided to go vegan. Cool, don\u2019t really care. Only issue I have is that they try to incorporate it into nearly every conversation we have. They have somewhat boring personalities so I guess they needed SOMETHING to make their personality about but it\u2019s ok. I was invited to their wedding and ngl, I had to think about it for a bit because I\u2019m not too big on social gatherings but it was my sister so I decided to go.\n\nAt the wedding, I had a fairly great time. Wasn\u2019t too bad. Got to talk to some new people and get out of my comfort zone a bit. The fun arrived to a complete stop when it was time to eat though. All the food was\u2026vegan. Things like bread, tofu salad\u2026.I don\u2019t even know, man. I wasn\u2019t the only one confused but the guests still dug in. I wasn\u2019t a fan though.\n\nI confronted my sister and Riley and asked what was up with all the vegan food. They said they wanted to \u201cpresent a different lifestyle to the guests\u201d and joked about \u201csteering them away from meat\u201d. I was pretty disgusted ngl. That sounded rude. I snapped back and said \u201cif I did the same thing to you guys but with meat, how would you react? Stop being so inconsiderate and learn to cater to your guests\u201d. \n\nShe told me if I had a problem with it, then \u201cthe door is to the left and I don\u2019t need to look back\u201d. I laughed and said there was no way she was kicking me out over me calling them out. She shrugged then walked away. Riley called me entitled and said I ruined what was supposed to be a special day. I sighed and left. That same night, I got a phone call from my dad that my sister was in tears. He told me I should\u2019ve acted my age and focused on my sister and her new husband, not the food. My mom also texted that my behaviour was shameful and that I wasn\u2019t raised to be judgemental of people\u2019s life choices.\n\nI immediately felt bad. I kept thinking about it. I couldn\u2019t sleep at night because I kept replaying the confrontation in my head. I was just sick of all this vegan crap being forced on me and I was \u201changry\u201d. AITA?\n\nEdit: Holy, ofc I don\u2019t eat meat every single day. I was just hungry and in the mood for some that day and when I saw the food and it was all vegan and looked like shit, I noped out.

In general you make unnecessary jabs at her (the personality comment) and don\u2019t seem to even care much about her (almost didn\u2019t go??).

There's a difference between having an ethical/moral based reasoning for not eating something rather than just not \"caring\" for how something tastes, but unless a person is physically unable to handle not having meat for every single meal (which would be indicative of a bigger problem) there's no reason for a guest at a 1 time event like a wedding can't have a meal that consists of vegetables or other non-meat items.", "It's one meal.

We had a fruit salad, veggie platter, broccoli salad and Mediterranean salad out on the same table as the vegan items. \n\nLater she sits by us eating and I notice she has only meat, pasta and bread. She told us she couldn't get any of the vegetarian items because they were all gone. I looked towards the table and see them still there. So I said that I see there were some left and I walk over there with her. She said she liked fruit salad but wouldn't be able to eat this one because it was \"vegan\". I explained it was just normal fruit from the grocery store that I had cut and mixed together. She again said that it was with the vegan stuff so it must be a \"vegan\" fruit salad.\n\nI honestly could not believe the conversation we were having. I finally told her I was sure I had more fruit salad prepared in the fridge in the kitchen. She got excited and filled up a bowl with the kitchen fruit salad. Even took the leftover kitchen fruit salad home with her.
