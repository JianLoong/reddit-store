Our parents thought it was too sudden but they left them alone because they\u2019re grown and can make their own decisions.\n\nAnyway, my sister and Riley have decided to go vegan.

I laughed and said there was no way she was kicking me out over me calling them out. She shrugged then walked away. Riley called me entitled and said I ruined what was supposed to be a special day. I sighed and left. That same night, I got a phone call from my dad that my sister was in tears. He told me I should\u2019ve acted my age and focused on my sister and her new husband, not the food. My mom also texted that my behaviour was shameful and that I wasn\u2019t raised to be judgemental of people\u2019s life choices.\n\nI immediately felt bad. I kept thinking about it.

AITA?\n\nEdit: Holy, ofc I don\u2019t eat meat every single day. I was just hungry and in the mood for some that day and when I saw the food and it was all vegan and looked like shit, I noped out.

She told us she couldn't get any of the vegetarian items because they were all gone. I looked towards the table and see them still there. So I said that I see there were some left and I walk over there with her. She said she liked fruit salad but wouldn't be able to eat this one because it was \"vegan\". I explained it was just normal fruit from the grocery store that I had cut and mixed together. She again said that it was with the vegan stuff so it must be a \"vegan\" fruit salad.\n\nI honestly could not believe the conversation we were having. I finally told her I was sure I had more fruit salad prepared in the fridge in the kitchen. She got excited and filled up a bowl with the kitchen fruit salad.

How unusual", "I have a dairy allergy and while not vegan my fiancee made me a bomb ass vegan carrot cake for my birthday. Times are changing and honestly a lot of vegan substitutes work better than they used to. Cocojunes yogurt tastes exactly like greek yogurt I was so shocked and violife makes vegan butter that actually browns. I wouldn't discount vegan cake immediately. You can even make a pretty good vegan buttercream using miyokos or violife butter.", "I worked with birthday parties as my first job, people would ordere vegan cakes ocassionally. We used one supplier at first and it wasn't good. Really dense, weird texture. Then we switched to another bakery, and they were really good, you wouldn't guess that it was vegan. I also tried some vegan cashew milk ice cream. It was ok, but it weirded me out because it didn't loose its shape when it was melting. \n\nOh and once I went to a party where there was a home-made vegan cake and it was honestly terrible. But I'm super picky about desserts, and I didn't think the flavors went well together (It was a spice cake with chocolate frosting). \n\nI think you CAN make good vegan cakes, it's just way harder.

To the couple for bending over backwards to be accommodating, and for you being so gracious.", "This. We asked everyone for dietary restrictions and accommodated every single one. It didn\u2019t cost more and wasn\u2019t a big deal to the caterer.

I think people grossly underestimate how many of their guests suffer in silence.", "In the case of vegan absolutely, it's not hard at all. Other intolerances like celiac for example are very misunderstood by chefs and people in hospitality. 'Oh it's gluten free', they say, as it's sitting half on top of something that's clearly not.  'Sure the sauce is gluten free, we only used soy' (which unless specifically gluten free is NOT gluten free).\n\nMy stepmother is celiac and I've quickly learned that many people just don't understand.

They were so much moister than my competitors and my favorite part was telling the judges, \u201cThey\u2019re vegan!\u201d A lot of people at the time were very much anti vegan for the sake of being anti vegan. It\u2019s incredibly close minded. And tbh I\u2019m only vegetarian now but I\u2019d take vegan cake over gluten free cake any day. Unfortunately I\u2019ve never had any gluten free alternatives that I enjoy very much but I\u2019m always curious to try.", "My vegan cake recipe I recently perfected everyone in my family agrees is way better than the non vegan one I made as a teenager. Most desserts are easy to veganize and keep pretty good.", "I know!

It's just easier that way.", "That sounds delicious, and I'm dissapointed I didn't get an invite", "I was just told by the caterer that it was the meal assigned to my seat and there were no other meals available.

If they had simply said \"Were vegan of course our wedding won't have meat\" then I would be 100% on their side but to say you wanted only vegan specifically to force it on others is not ok its entitlement...\n\nAgain I am not defending OP I do not understand why yall seem to think I believe that their wedding should have meat when I've stated multiple times in multiple ways that OP IS TA and shouldnt have complained about their wedding being Vegan.
