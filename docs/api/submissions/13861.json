Sian had it for 3 days and was more than happy to give it back! She had often made comments about how she couldn\u2019t wait to have a baby and has now stated several times that she wants to wait, so I was grateful she was given this experience. \n\nMy friend \u201cChloe\u201d has been trying to conceive for 2 years and has had several miscarriages and every time it happened she has fallen deeper into depression. Sadly 3 months ago her partner left her as he couldn\u2019t take anymore, she is 37 and is convinced it has taken away her last chance to have a baby. \n\nWhilst Sian was looking after this doll Chloe was fascinated by it and looked into it online and came across reborn dolls. She had one made and has called it \u201cHope\u201d \nI have tried to be supportive because I know she\u2019s struggling but I\u2019m becoming increasingly frustrated and worried by her behaviour. \n\nAll Chloe talks about now is \u201cHope\u201d about her sleepless nights and that the \u201cbaby\u201d has colic and she brings this doll everywhere in a pram or car seat, strangers don\u2019t always realise it\u2019s a doll but it gets awkward when they do. A woman approached us in a cafe last week to take a peek at the baby then backed away in surprise, she went back to her friends on her table and they were all pointing and laughing. \n\nI want to protect Chloe and have tried not to make her feel bad or embarrassed because I\u2019m hoping this will pass, but here\u2019s where I might be TAH. \n\nI work nights and finish at 8am as a health care worker, I need my sleep as I do 12 hour shifts.\nChloe came and was knocking on my door for 5 minutes and woke me up, I got out of bed terrified it was an emergency. She handed me her doll and asked if I could babysit \u201cHope\u201d because she was going to get her hair done and didn\u2019t think \u201cthe baby\u201d would settle and was best off with me. \n\nI\u2019d had a difficult night and I was exhausted, I told Chloe she would be ok to leave her doll at home for once and it\u2019s not like it was going to come to any harm, I said \u201cpretend it\u2019s sleeping\u201d \nChloe burst into tears and said I didn\u2019t understand and she couldn\u2019t bear to lose another child. \nI hugged her and said it was maybe time for some professional help. Chloe said how she already goes to grief counselling and is in therapy and neither of these professionals have dissuaded her from having Hope. She then started to get angry and said I didn\u2019t understand because I have children and haven\u2019t been through what she has. \n\nShe\u2019s now stopped speaking to me and I\u2019m worried because I was a big part of her support system. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for her life to revolve round this doll.

You were not in a good state to.\n\nNta", "NTA, at her age this is kind of disturbing, hopefully she comes out of it.", "Two specialists condone this? This sounds more traumatizing that helpful. What if she does have kids? It's not impossible, but will that child be required to treat the doll like a sister?", "NTA. She definitely needs professional help. Her behavior is delusional and very unhealthy. You were right not to play along, she needs a huge reality check", "NTA.\n\nYou have supported her as much as you can. It's unfortunate she decided to stop talking to you. She is seeing counseling. I actually agree mostly with the counselors allowing her to keep the doll like a crutch in the mean time, but I cannot imagine the counselors know the extent in which having this doll is sacrificing other relationships in her life.\n\nI recommend seeing a counselor at least once yourself to help you make sense from a professional angle on helping your friend, then after that a few couple's sessions with her (couple's counseling can be between platonic friendships too, not just romantic). My hope is that her counselors can understand the full picture of her attachment to this doll and how it is starting to be a negative impact on her life instead of helping.", "NAH- she\u2019s clearly going through something that the doll may help her cope with. That being said, there\u2019s no reason for you to be woken up to care for a doll.", "NTA\n\nYour friend needs to get real help ASAP. It seems the groups she's going to aren't working. Anyway, you're not responsible for her and if she doesn't want you around.anymore, so be it. You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped.", "NTA - Those things are an incredibly invasive coping mechanism. You're no more obligated to put up with it than you would be if your friend were coping with drugs and was disrupting your life. I would suggest to her that she needs a different, healthier way to deal with her situation and that if she doesn't want one it may be time to wind down the friendship. As she is now you two are not compatible friends anymore.", "NTA. \n\nYou're completely correct. Your friend does need professional help. I understand that depression can be debilitating and finding a tool to get through it is great, but eventually the source has to be addressed. And it sounds like the professionals she's seeing should have their license to practice revoked", "NAH  \nI don't blame you for the way you reacted, I'd probably act the same if I was woken up after a 12hr shift.  \nWhat your friend is going through is heartbreaking. I know she goes to therapy, but maybe she needs a different approach since it doesn't seem to be working. I hope she'll get the help she needs.", "NTA I mean, this was going to come up at some point. If she hasn\u2019t already gotten the idea that this is inappropriate behavior I think you did the best here.

My god. Oof.", "NTA and I'm sorry for your friend's loss/situation.", "NTA. Like one other person said, even if it were a real baby, you would not be obligated to say \"yes\" taking care of it, especially, if someone wakes you up from sleeping with a last-minute demand. If your friend wants the experience of having a real baby, then she needs to learn both to plan ahead for things like hair appointments, and that a child is her responsibility, not the responsibility of the people around her.\n\nAlso, by using you as such a big part of her support system (her grief councilors notwithstanding), she is putting an unfair amount of pressure on you. All so she can maintain the fantasy that she has a real baby.", "NAH. \n\nYou are most definitely *not* the asshole here. Even if \"Hope\" were a real baby, you would not be obligated to babysit. \n\nI'm struggling to call Chloe an asshole either because she's obviously struggling with her mental health, although getting angry at you and refusing to speak to you is getting her pretty close. More than anything though, I don't think this \"baby\" is helping her as much as she thinks it is. She seems disturbingly close to not being able to separate reality from fantasy if she's not already fully there and I don't think it's helping her cope here.", "Have you asked to come with her to a therapy session to ask these questions?  Because they are probably trying to slow walk her through this.  You took a hammer to her fragile emotional state.  You are n an ah for wanting to babysit the doll, but yta for deciding what she needed right now.", "Holy hell. \n\nNTA and I hope Chloe gets the help she needs.", "NAH. \n\nShe does need help, and she\u2019s seeking it. I truly hope overtime she comes to terms with never having a child and the doll thing ends. \n\nHas she considered foster care or adoption? There are other options for her and my heart breaks for her.", "NTA and I applaud your concern for her. \n\nI think it\u2019s okay to have a candid and honest conversation with her about the fact that you find it impossible to treat her doll with the same concern and care as a real child. And while you love her and want this doll to be a constructive part of her healing, she needs to stay in the realm of reality and respect that no one else can or should be called upon to share her perspective that a doll requires the same level of priority as a living and breathing child. It defies logic. \n\nI question whether the professionals in her life actually condone the level of devotion she applies to the doll because I wonder if she\u2019s actually capable of being completely honest about it with them. I would bet that she guards her access to the doll assiduously. And if she has, it may be that they view her as too fragile to confront currently. Either way, if I were her friend, I\u2019d call the therapist and tell them your concerns with no expectation that they reply in any way since they cannot. Or you can offer to go to an appointment with your friend so you can broach the subject with the therapist\u2019s help. \n\nI can tell you care about your friend and are very worried. Rightfully so.

I think she\u2019s signed off with compassionate leave or something at the moment but she won\u2019t properly admit to it and just changes the subject if anyone asks what grounds she has for being signed off. \nI can\u2019t believe I never thought to ask if she takes the doll to therapy sessions or not, I\u2019d love to know now! \nThere is some level of manipulation because everyone is so ready to accept this doll as a baby and I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s all sympathy. We have a lot of mutual friends and you would think this would come up for discussion a lot, it seems no one wants to broach it and be the AH for saying it\u2019s not right.", "> I think I\u2019m going to have to jump in and ask them their opinion and see if we can all try to divert her whilst supporting her.\n\nYou're clearly a good, caring friend.  I suspect the rest of the friend group will be relieved to have you bring it up and most will be on board with having a consistent strategy.", "I was in a situation very similar to this a few years ago, and this is the type of thing that irrevocably splits friend groups.  Not 100 the same, but yeah\u2026.\n\nYoung widow doing some very shady horizontal shit with one of the groomsmen from her wedding (that was less than 2 months prior) after her husband died.  The groomsman in question was dying of cancer, and she basically \u201ctook over his care since she couldn\u2019t save husband.\u201d  (The groomsman had a perfectly good family to do that for him and she was making care decisions without them.)It was all really disturbing because there were people who were like \u201cOh it\u2019s so romantic!  They found each other!\u201d A\\nd others who were like, \u201cYes, but add in all of this other stuff, and Holy shit, this is Dateline Bingo!\u201d\n\nProblem was, \u201cto keep the peace\u201d everyone was being polite and no one was actually having real hard conversations like, \u201cWhy are we really at these two extremes? What are you seeing that I\u2019m not?\u201d And most importantly, \u201cWhat are we going to do as a united front to get her better help than she\u2019s currently getting?\u201d\n\nSo when the groomsman died, all hell broke loose.  Everyone who was encouraging the behavior got mad that those who were vocal about their distrust from the beginning weren\u2019t being open armed supportive about her \u201ctwo tragic losses.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s been years, and we\u2019re all still careful with what we say around each other.  We see her from time to time, but it\u2019s all bare minimum politeness where absolutely necessary.  I still get triggered by the situation, but it\u2019s taken me a long time and a lot of work to accept that she wasn\u2019t the entire problem. It was people not using their damn words and not facing the hard stuff.\n\nChloe is clearly having trauma. If you\u2019ve got a friend who is particularly on the pro-Hope side, I would try to sit them down and have a conversation about the situation in a \u201cI\u2019m seeing this as a problem and I\u2019d like your take. What can we do to support Chloe through this.\u201d  Compare notes, listen, and most importantly don\u2019t turn it into a gossip sesh.  Leave with goals and next steps if you can.  Do this together because if you do it alone, she\u2019ll just run to the pro-Hope people even more and then you\u2019ll be on Reddit in about 5 years going, \u201cDid I ever tell you about my ex-friend Chloe?\u201d\n\nGood luck to you all.", "Thank you for telling your story. \nI\u2019ll try and get some conversations going and try to stop people sweeping it under the carpet.\nIt\u2019s going to be difficult but I think it\u2019ll be helpful if the people in her life face up to it in order to help her. \nI can understand why you were upset in that situation and it is difficult and frustrating when people tip toe around something that needs facing head on. \nChloe isn\u2019t sleeping she\u2019s literally getting up and down in the night to feed and see to \u201cthe baby\u201d \nShe speaks about it openly that \u201cHope has kept her up all night\u201d and I\u2019m desperate for someone to acknowledge it isn\u2019t normal, it doesn\u2019t have to be there and then but no one seems overly concerned. \nI\u2019ve considered offering to babysit so I know she\u2019s sleeping but I\u2019m scared I\u2019m feeding her delusion. I think she\u2019d be more then willing to accept as it makes it seem real to her. \nI\u2019ll try speaking to her brother, they are close and he\u2019s managing not to get involved as he\u2019s always said he\u2019s childfree and happy. Chloe seems to to accept this and when she talks about \u201cthe baby\u201d he just says he\u2019s not a baby person and she knows that. Maybe he can try to talk to her and I\u2019ll see if I can get some friends together too. \nI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to speak to her therapist and let them know what\u2019s going on. \nI hope things have improved with your friendship group, no one understands how difficult these situations are until it happens to them."]}
