He doesn't have to like them, but if he said \"I don't like that you got those tattoos and need to process this\" (or literally any other explanation) he'd not be an asshole. But going full silent treatment with your spouse is almost always AH behavior.", "Seriously? While she's at it, she ought to sit down and have a deep conversation about the next time (or first time) she wants to pierce her ears or dye her hair. So he can give her the same cold shoulder.

Could've just been mentioned in passing as something op was considering. Like you said though, it's still her body.", "Some people process things by talking them out, some people don't. It's not immature to not want to talk to someone if you're upset. It is immature to decide your way of processing things is the only mature way. Also, you're ignoring that the OP said they brought it up more than once. If the husband liked the idea, his response would be something like, \"Yeah, cool, go do it.\" OP knew it would upset him, and it's immature to try to surprised Pikachu face when she let's him know she did something he wasn't very happy about.\n\nAlso, this isn't a \"my body my choice issue.\" This is a play stupid games win stupid prize issue. Instead of antagonizing your partner to see how much they love you, leave them and find someone who likes you having tattoos.", "I find tattoo\u2019s absolutely repulsive.

You're saying you communicated to your husband three different ways, and didn't get a response to any of them?  I'm just super confused on how this is possible.  Is this, like, normal, for you two?\n\nI mean walk me though this.  You tell him on the phone and what, just silence?  No words at all?  And if so, you took that to mean, \"I'm pretty sure everything is OK here and I should proceed with my plans.\" And how did the conversation end, you just hung up, or left the phone on the counter and walked away, or what?", "OP said she brought it up and was ignored. A mature person doesn't shut down immediately. Yes, some people don't like to talk when they're upset but its a spouse. You can't shut down all communication in a relationship and expect it to survive. \n\nIf hubby won't communicate one way or the other, she can't hold her life until he decides he wants to talk. Maybe, if he had said \"I don't want you to get a tattoo\"  OP would have reconsidered, but you can't expect her to read his mind.", "Different cultures in history will tell you otherwise about that but each their own.", "If they are shutting down, they obviously don't like the idea. The \"but it's a spouse\" concept goes both ways. You can't do things you know cause your spouse to shut down and expect the relationship to survive.\n\nHubby should just leave her, and both can work on finding people they actually are compatible with. Also, after she gets the tattoo, she can read his mind well enough to figure out that shutting down isn't good. It's too bad she couldn't figure that out before getting the tattoos.", "and another culture will say that you go to hell if you get one. whats your point?", "Well that is my opinion anyway and my husband agrees", "I don't entirely agree with \"just leave\". Unless this is a deal breaker for either of them, which the fact neither of them has called anything off is a sign it may not be, this is something you can address in counseling. If you can't work it out through communication then make the decision to leave or not. Definitely get this figured out though before you get married, divorces are a lot messier and more expensive than break-ups.", "My man, tattoos have a fascinating history as some believe that tattoos were first used as a form of medicine or acupuncture, while others associate tattoos with religious or spiritual practices. In fact, some cultures still view tattoos as sacred, with spiritual or ceremonial significance. In Polynesia, for example, tattoos are seen as a way of connecting with one's ancestors, while in Japan, tattoos are sometimes used to ward off evil spirits.\nThe significance of tattoos have changed in the Western world, especially within the last 20 to 30 years. If you look at the history of tattooing, it wasn't for status or to be cool, it was for more significant reasons.\n\n\u00a0", "So hypothetical question.

It is not tit-for-tat. (No pun intended). It is not a circumstance where you did something unacceptable so he is doing something unacceptable. It is a circumstance where he is attempting to make you responsible for his emotions. \n\nPlease see this as a red flag, and watch in the future for other controlling or manipulative behavior. Mature adults talk to each other, even when they are hurt.", "A lot of people find tattoos extremely trashy and I hear the garbage truck coming for your relationship.", "NTA. you mentioned it beforehand and it's not your fault he refuses to communicate his thoughts and feelings on the matter. besides, at the end of the day it's your body!", "I think I can see the solution here. Full sleeve.", "I see both of your sides. This is a soft NTA for you, cause obviously your body, but he probably felt blindsided as i didn\u2019t see you telling him that you made the appointment or anything and you just kinda came home with it. I am personally the same way, if im not aware of big changes like that and then it is sprung on me i will for sure feel some type of way, even if it is something im totally okay with.  if anything he is most likely hurt that he wasn\u2019t made more aware of it", "You need to decide if you still wanna be married to this immature man. He\u2019s 30 years old and still doesn\u2019t know how to use his words??? This would make me second guess if he\u2019s someone I could grow old with.

But I can't make a judgement without knowing if this effects his ability to look at you without seeing the tattoo encroaching on the face?\n\nMy cousin decided to get her EX's name on her neck after he OD.

Some by choice but they all change over time.\n\nI\u2019m more concerned about the lack of communication, is this more than just getting tattoos?  Maybe he sees them as a representation that you want to get a little wilder and that scares him.  No, not everyone with tattoos is joining a motorcycle club and tootling off to swinger\u2019s clubs but I don\u2019t know this man, maybe that\u2019s what he thinks.\n\nI think it\u2019s time to take the lead and send him a message that a silent treatment marriage doesn\u2019t work for you and you expect to talk this out tonight.  If it was me, I\u2019d send a text around lunchtime so he has a few hours to pull his thoughts together.  Good luck!", "Context is key. There's obviously some meaning to the tattoo or it's location/size making it hard to judge.", "She did what she wanted with her own body. He realizes he can\u2019t control her. Now he has a mad.", "You need to change the relationship dynamics. Don't ever ask him if he still wants to stay married to you when you get the silent treatment. You're giving away your power. You told him you were getting them. He didn't say no. You did nothing wrong. When he gives you the silent treatment pretend it doesn't hurt you and act normal.\n\nNTA", "Silent treatment is emotional abuse. Op asked the wrong person if they still want to be married. Op needs to think about their own answer to this question.", "Jesus, you sound like the human equivalent of an unsalted pretzel.", "People are allowed their opinions. I loathe tattoos whilst some people love them and some people are indifferent to them. We are all individuals who are entitled to our own opinions", "I mean, are we really individuals, or is that just an illusion we cling to in order to make our lives feel less pathetic? Anyways, you can't be UPSET at another's  OPINION bc of INDIVIDUALITY and RESPECT or some new age bullshit.", "Info: was your only form of communication post tattoo was to passively aggressively ask if he wanted to be married to you still? Have you directly asked him why he won't even look at you, why he's acting this way, does he not remember you bringing it up before, etc? Like sit him down and not let him run away from a genuine conversation?", "It's your body.\n\nHe should have spoken up when you mentioned it.\n\nThis might be a deal breaker for him and that is absolutely his right.\n\nSo be prepared, if he is so bothered by tattoos, it could mean the end of your relationship.", "I misread \"forearm\" as \"forehead\" and did a double take. It still wouldn't have mattered, your body is your body.", ">I don't subscribe to the idea that you need to consult your partner to change things like that.\n\nI disagree. Tattoos are a permanent thing. And depending on what they are and where you get them, they could definitely bother a partner. There's some real fucking stupid or weird tattoos out there that nobody wants to see while getting intimate. \n\nThere's also sentimental ones that could be disturbing when getting intimate. An example I used the last time I had this discussion was a person getting the face of their mother who died during childbirth tattooed onto them. It's sentimental and has a meaning of their mum always being with them. \n\nBut nobody wants to see their partner's mother's face (dead or alive) when having sex. It would definitely be a turn off or just plain weird to a lot of people.\n\nIf you're in a relationship and planning on making permanent body modifications, you should imo discuss it with your partner. That way you can both make informed decisions regarding your futures. You both decide whether the tattoo is worth ending your relationship or upsetting your partner over. \n\nEveryone's better off when they have information on which they can base their decisions on.", "OP doesn't know because he won't talk to her.
