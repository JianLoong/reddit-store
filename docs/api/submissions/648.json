I just got engaged to my (25m) fiance Dave. Dave and I plan on getting an apartment together, but the reason we haven't yet is because of my childhood cat (16f) kitty, who is in her geriatric years and needs special care. My mom is never home to take care of her. I've had her since I was 8 and I know she won't be around much longer. I love her to death.(I can't take the cat away with me to live because it's \"moms\" cat).\n\nKitty needs help getting around the house (she can't jump anymore) and she requires special diet/supplements, which I mix into her food and give to her everyday that help her joints feel better. After that, she usually demands a snack every two hours. Not only do I feed both cats, but I also keep the house clean so mom isn't stressed when she gets home.\u00a0\n\nHere's where the problem lies. Mom claims to be in a relationship with (35m) Leo and he only comes over super late at night and stays for days on end, only when mom is here though. I do not have a problem with Leo staying over, however he is disrespectful to the fact that Kitty and I still live here too.\n\nKitty has a heart murmur and I let Leo know as she is scared of strangers and loud noises. She has dementia and gets scared easily. I have to comfort her/make sure she is fed before I go to sleep or she wont let me sleep.\u00a0\n\nOne night, I was comforting Kitty after mom and Leo \"went to bed\". Mom was stripping her clothes off walking around the house in her underwear in front of me, so I knew what was about to go down. Later, Kitty got up from her spot because she heard a noise. I thought she wanted food so I got up too. I heard what the cat heard and it was a noise I wish I hadn't heard.\u00a0\n\nI confronted mom about being too loud the next day. I told her it is disrespectful and it makes me uncomfortable that she and Leo are being so loud and making me and the cat uncomfortable while I'm living there. She laughed at me and said it's impossible for them to be quiet, that I'm downstairs super late, and that this is her house. I then told my little sister (22f) Ann (she is better at talking to my mom than me) and then mom apologized and she said she would never want to make me uncomfortable and she didn't realize it was an issue.\n\nThe next day Leo came over again and mom was like \"Leo, she heard us\" and they both started laughing at me. Since then it has gotten worse. Dave was even over and we were watching a movie and we heard them all the way from upstairs. He was like \"they are doing the dirty\" and I was like \"yeah..\" I told mom, Dave and I heard them and she said \"Haha yeah Leo wasn't even trying to be quiet\".\u00a0\n\nNow Leo brings his pitbull over and Kitty gets scared and they don't care. They start up in the bedroom while I'm still downstairs trying to comfort Kitty and are super loud to the point where I just want to leave because of how disrespected I feel.\n\nI'm just wondering, am I right for feeling this way?\n\n\nEdit: For all those saying my mom doesnt want me there... the confusing thing is she does want me there... a little too much if you ask me. She even wants my fiance to move in her house with me so \"I can always live with her forever\"(her words). She constantly asks when I'm coming home when I'm gone and she gets into end her life mode when I tell her I'm moving out because I'm leaving her \"all alone\". She does this to my little sister Ann as well so it's nothing we havent experienced before.\n\nEdit #2: Now for people saying \"making the cat uncomfortable with sex now that's ridiculous\" no it's not the sex that makes her uncomfortable. That would be ridiculous. It's the pitbull.", "created_utc": 1667083233, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygx6r8/aita_for_asking_my_mom_and_her_bf_to_be_more/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
