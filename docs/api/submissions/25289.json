Best to you!", "NTA at all. You're very kind and welcoming to allow your sister and her son into your home. TV and coffee are far from necessities - and if they're items that she wants, as an adult, she can decide to purchase/acquire them.

I watch programs on my computer and see no reason to buy a TV incase a guest want to watch a program\nYour sister is very entitled.  First she moves in with you with her son.  Not your responsibility but you let her stay.  Then she is mad your home does not have items she wants to use but you have no need to use.  She knew when she disrupted your life and moved in that you didn't have these items.  You are not obligated to provide them for her.  If she wants a TV for her child she can buy a TV for her child.  E wont be hsrmed by watching less tv. Stand up for yourself. Let her know this is your home and you get to decide what you buy for your own home. If she doesn't like it she can provide her and her child with their own home.  People will use you and mistreat you no matter how hard to try to be kind if you allow them to do so. Don't allow her to treat you this way. Give one warning that this behavior has to stop or she will have to move out. Don't be a doormat. Her problems are not your problems.  Don't let her give you her problems to solve. You would not be doing her a favor.", "NTA.

A 29yo doesn't get the difference between a TV and a monitor???\n\nI'd get it if she was much younger, or much older. But how does a 29yo get through life without knowing the difference between a TV and a monitor? She's exactly the right age to remember the transition from TV to streaming, so this would have been very important knowledge for her. \n\nAlso, the coffee machine? Most people I know her age don't have one. The avid millennial coffee drinkers will get a French press, or an iced coffee tumbler - something that takes less counter space, is faster, easier to clean, and can serve multiple functions.

Because the way I read the situation is she feels insecure about her own situation especially having to ask for help from her brother who is 7 years younger than her. She probably feels inadequate as the older sister and so her way of trying to prove she\u2019s older and wiser (deep down she is projecting her insecurity onto you) is by nitpicking at things in your apartment. I don\u2019t think it excuses your sister\u2019s behavior at all and I don\u2019t think you need to kick her out but perhaps it helps shed light on where it comes from and creating a safe space for her to talk vulnerably and by doing that, you can also tell her what you are feeling (also setting some boundaries is important here for yourself)", "NTA\n\nBut maybe I'm the wrong person to be judging because I have an ancient CRT TV with no streaming services, and no coffee machine either . . . though I did finally get a little individual pour-over setup this year after 13 years in my apartment, LOL. \n\nYour sister is being ridiculous.

You're NTA.\n\nThat said, for not much money you could get a small TV used on Craigslist and a Roku type streaming box that would solve this for you. Her son is 5, he doesn't need a massive 4k TV.

You are letting her stay their rent free to help her out and she is acting entitled and ungrateful.", "NTA you are providing her a kindness of being in your home if she really needs a coffee maker and TV she can go out and get them... to me it just sounds like she doesn't want to buy a TV. It is your job to make her feel welcomed it is not your job to provide her with the most comfortable space for her needs.", "NTA - if she wants it so bad, she can get it together, get her own place, and buy one herself\n\nOtherwise, she'll need to learn how to be appreciative and show grace.", "Nta.

Live your life.  \n\nAs to whether it would be nice and proper for you to supply a TV. I can see the argument if you have lots of means.  I mean it's not a requirement, but if you are the only reasonable option for the little shit to watch his shows, and the money wouldn't inconvenience you at all, you could always buy them a literal 50 dollar tv as a gift.\n\nbut i'd never let anyone guilt me into doing something I didn't want to do.", "NTA. \nIt doesn\u2019t sound like she is grateful for what you do provide. \nOr maybe she is just stressed and is allowing those two things to really bother her. \nEither way, she needs to realize you are allowing her to stay with you and she can get a tv if it\u2019s really that big of a deal.", "NTA because you are not a hotel and she's not paying for the things she wants you to provide.", "NTA but a mattress directly on the floor will get gross fast.

TV is not that expensive anymore and coffee maker are dirt cheap.  though to be honest, it is probably much cheaper to get instant coffee and heat water from the microwave.", "NTA.

Tell her she can buy her own TV and coffee maker, or she can move out.", "Nta, why would your home be structured around what other people want?", "NTA\n\nSounds like she was in a bad place, and you\u2019re helping her, you\u2019d think she\u2019d be a bit more\u2026appreciative?\n\nEither way it\u2019s your place, she has no right to \u2018dictate\u2019 anything to you especially regarding your own belongings. She is your guest.\n\nIt\u2019s great you\u2019re helping her, but just a suggestion you may want to have the conversation about her \u2018getting back on her feet\u2019 sooner rather than later.", "So, NTA. Since outside of these moments you two are getting alone fine, I do wonder if her expressing these frustrations is coming from something deeper though, rather than her feeling entitled about objects.\n\nFirst, you say you live very minimally. When she moved in, did you do *anything* to spruce up the spaces they'd be using, or get something for their comfort, or anything else that would make the space feel more welcoming to them? It is understandably a big imposition to move in with a family member during a rough time, and she's probably pretty self conscious about it. Getting her and her child some personal towels or their own sheets/pillows or something like that would be a signal to her that you're thinking about their wellbeing/comfort during this big and uncomfortable life change, and that you want to help support them through it. Like I NEVER drink coffee but when a friend who does visited me earlier this year, I went and got a $20 french press and bag of coffee for her so she'd be comfortable in the morning and know I was thinking about her, because she's my good friend. That seems more like what the coffee maker is about to me--YOU don't drink coffee, but you probably know she likes to drink it, but you didn't even bother to mention to her that it wouldn't be an option. If she was just coming for the weekend that wouldn't be more than an annoying morning discovery. But for someone moving in long term, it comes across as pretty unwelcoming... like it says that you don't think/care about her needs, she is imposing on your space and you don't want to alter it for her, and it makes it just another thing she has to figure out alone. \n\nShe's also probably struggling to transition to a new space in general and having to come up with all new routines. Like entertaining a child solo now that she doesn't have a partner, being overwhelmed, and getting frustrated there's no easy out such as turning on a movie/show he likes. Of course it shouldn't be up to you to get one if you don't need it, but maybe you could have offered to help look for a deal on one if she's willing to pay for it, or see if any of your friends/coworkers have an old one sitting in a closet for now. Or offer to set one up if she brings it home. Sure, it's not on you to buy it, but you could make a gesture of another sort to show that you hear her frustration and want to help with it in ways besides monetarily. \n\nSo, no, NTA for not having coffee and a tv around. But, maybe take those comments as a sign that you should tell her directly that you don't resent her presence, and get her something to make the place a little homier for her and her child so she knows you mean it.", "time to change the locks and kick her out...NTA"]}
