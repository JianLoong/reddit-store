I am glad she is fine on other things, but you are 100% fine choosing to live as you do.  You are right things are probably stressful with her situation and living in such a small place with you, but again she Could be a bit appreciative.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have these things. If she wants them, she\u2019ll have to provide them.", "NTA - She can go get a $100 TV for their room and a $20 coffee maker.  Or, she could leave and grow up and become a parent.", "NTA. She should be grateful to you for opening your small apartment to her and your young nephew. It's YOUR apartment. Someone gives you a place to live, which she obviously doesn't have at the moment, and she has the audacity to complain about what you have and don't have? Tough titty. Her having coffee and her son's entertainment are not your responsibilities. I suggest setting a deadline for her to find her own space.", "NTA \n\nYou're being a good sibling for providing a living space for your sister and her child. If she wants something she could just buy it or offer to split the cost with whatever she can afford to pay if it's a necessity like feminine hygiene products. Otherwise, I don't think she should be in any way angry about small things like that.", "NTA you kindly provided space in a time of need. You're not a full service hotel.", "NTA. Just for shits and giggles I suggest you disconnect your monitor from the computer and bring it into the living room and tell her she\u2019s welcome to hook it up.", "NTA I dislike it when people stick up for shitty behavior because that person is struggling. Some people get traumatized and still act decently and other people become AH\u2019s the second life isn\u2019t their way.", "NTA \n\nYou're not running a hotel so she shouldn't expect things like a TV or coffee maker.  Plenty of people don't have one.\n\n\nI know people who doesn't watch cable so there's no point of having a TV.  Coffee maker is also not a necessity in life so I don't know why she's mad you don't have one.", "NTA\n\n Why are you still allowing her to live with you??", "NTA\n\nShe can easily provide  her own coffee and your nephew can use his other technology for entertainment.", "NTA - She showed up at your door and her fixation is to be pissed over a coffee machine and  a TV.  If this is how she blows off steam re: her circumstance it is NOT fair to you.  I'd expect her to verbalize gratitude since she sprinted away from her old life. I like to play the piano but won't dream of asking where yours is?  Nice job stabilizing and normalizing their lives. Loss of housing can make most lives spiral down several depths. Best to you!", "NTA at all. You're very kind and welcoming to allow your sister and her son into your home. TV and coffee are far from necessities - and if they're items that she wants, as an adult, she can decide to purchase/acquire them. You've provided shelter, safety and a bit of security in her time of need... you should feel secure in what you're providing. It sounds like you're already giving her a lot of grace for her behavior.", "Nta. I don't have  a coffee machine. I don't drink coffee and see no reason I should buy one for a guest. I watch programs on my computer and see no reason to buy a TV incase a guest want to watch a program\nYour sister is very entitled.  First she moves in with you with her son.  Not your responsibility but you let her stay.  Then she is mad your home does not have items she wants to use but you have no need to use.  She knew when she disrupted your life and moved in that you didn't have these items.  You are not obligated to provide them for her.  If she wants a TV for her child she can buy a TV for her child.  E wont be hsrmed by watching less tv. Stand up for yourself. Let her know this is your home and you get to decide what you buy for your own home. If she doesn't like it she can provide her and her child with their own home.  People will use you and mistreat you no matter how hard to try to be kind if you allow them to do so. Don't allow her to treat you this way. Give one warning that this behavior has to stop or she will have to move out. Don't be a doormat. Her problems are not your problems.  Don't let her give you her problems to solve. You would not be doing her a favor.", "NTA. F*Uck off is a complete sentence", "NAH\n\nSit your sister down and make her understand that this is your place. You've lived here as a single bachelor pad. This is temporary stay for you so live minimal and stop being entitled.", "Ok I'm about to call Y T A, bc this can't be real! A 29yo doesn't get the difference between a TV and a monitor???\n\nI'd get it if she was much younger, or much older. But how does a 29yo get through life without knowing the difference between a TV and a monitor? She's exactly the right age to remember the transition from TV to streaming, so this would have been very important knowledge for her. \n\nAlso, the coffee machine? Most people I know her age don't have one. The avid millennial coffee drinkers will get a French press, or an iced coffee tumbler - something that takes less counter space, is faster, easier to clean, and can serve multiple functions. The \"everyone must have a coffee machine\" is a boomer thing. \n\nIs your sister actually 59, you just changed the ages so we wouldn't guess?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm in my 40s and still don't have a coffee maker because I don't like the taste and caffeine makes me jittery. (My doctor once called me a chemical barometer, lol.)

If she wants something you don't have, she's free to buy it and take it with her when she does move out.", "NTA\n\nI definitely think you should try and talk with your sister about what the core issues are. Because the way I read the situation is she feels insecure about her own situation especially having to ask for help from her brother who is 7 years younger than her. She probably feels inadequate as the older sister and so her way of trying to prove she\u2019s older and wiser (deep down she is projecting her insecurity onto you) is by nitpicking at things in your apartment. I don\u2019t think it excuses your sister\u2019s behavior at all and I don\u2019t think you need to kick her out but perhaps it helps shed light on where it comes from and creating a safe space for her to talk vulnerably and by doing that, you can also tell her what you are feeling (also setting some boundaries is important here for yourself)", "NTA\n\nBut maybe I'm the wrong person to be judging because I have an ancient CRT TV with no streaming services, and no coffee machine either . . . though I did finally get a little individual pour-over setup this year after 13 years in my apartment, LOL. \n\nYour sister is being ridiculous.
