I love her dearly and cherish the relationship we have together and I would NEVER do anything to purposely upset her.\n\nThis starts when Lily gets proposed to by her boyfriend Cam around a year before the wedding actually takes place. Right after the proposal she asked me to be her bridesmaid and I very excitedly say yes! A while later we start dress shopping and me along with all the other bridesmaids go to a bridal store to pick out dresses all with the same requirements: they had to be sapphire blue and have a slit. I ended up finding a very pretty dark sapphire blue dress that went well with my eyes and fit me very nicely. My aunt approved it and I though all was well, until the wedding. \n\nThe day of the wedding I did my makeup as nice as I could and did my own hair as well, i\u2019m not very good at hair so i just curled it. The wedding was beautiful, my aunt looked beautiful, and no problems actually occurred at or on the wedding day. It was after. \n\nA bit later my aunt got her wedding photos back and I could tell she was angry with me through my grandma and the fact she was reluctant to share these photos with me. I didn\u2019t confront her about it because i was confused but my grandma called me to tell me i should talk to her so i did. I called her and asked her if she was upset with me and she said that i knew what i did upstaging her at her wedding. i was very confused at this point but for a bit more context i\u2019m in shape and am pretty stereotypically attractive. My aunt, who is also very pretty, is kinda insecure and slightly overweight, but i have always found her very pretty nonetheless. She told me that I should never have worn makeup because I knew that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for her to look good next to me. \n\nShe never told me not to wear makeup or do my hair or anything like that otherwise i really wouldn\u2019t have. She also said something about my dress saying i should have picked one out with less of a slit because of my long legs. I would\u2019ve gladly done this had she told me to. I tried to explain to her that i didn\u2019t mean to upset her and assured her she looked gorgeous all day, but i also told her if she didn\u2019t want me doing that stuff or wearing that dress she should have told me. she just told me back that \u201ci should\u2019ve known\u201d and i just don\u2019t understand if i\u2019m missing something here or what. i don\u2019t want this to be a big thing but my grandma is upset with me and so is my aunt idk what to do.\ncan somebody help?\naita?", "created_utc": 1691115687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hnfuf/aita_for_outshining_my_aunt_at_her_wedding/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she had an issue with how you looked, she should have said something earlier \n\nPersonally, I can\u2019t stand wearing makeup. But people that choose to wear makeup typically do so at formal events like weddings.  If she didn\u2019t want you wearing makeup, she should have said so, although that would be an odd request. \n\nYou did nothing wrong\n\nWhy did she ask you to be in the wedding party if she\u2019s so insecure about her looks compared to yours", "NTA. Auntie is projecting her shit onto you. She approved the dress, she said nothing day of, and now she's mad?\n\nI will bet you that she changes her mind.", "NTA. the only thing that would have pleased her would have been a burlap sack.", "NTA. What are you supposed to be - a mind-reader? She knew the dress, so that's on her. And who would expect their bridemaids to not put on makeup? She sounds extremely immature.", "NTA.\n\nShe approved of the dress, and obviously saw your makeup before the wedding and didn\u2019t say a single thing. You\u2019ve done all you\u2019ve reasonably could, and you\u2019re not responsible for her insecurities.", "Oh, please. NTA. It takes a very insecure person to try to shame a teenager for \"competing\" with them. Even at a wedding.\n\n16 is probably the worst age to compare against. Young women are trying to do prom, or sweet 16, they get a lot of recent practice getting dressed up.", "NTA. Your aunt needs to grow up. She owes you an apology.", "NTA. Your aunt saw and approved the dress. I don't think you deliberately attempted to upstage your aunt; it's not your fault if you're attractive by default.\n\nThere really is no cure for insecurity.", "Nta. Unless there\u2019s something missing here she and grandma are both behaving absurdly. You were supposed to try to look\u2026 bad? And you were supposed to intuit this somehow? Are they even hearing themselves?", "NTA\n\n\"you should have known\" really? how? \n\nShe's mad because you looked good at her wedding? wow. she'll get over it and if she doesn't she has some real self esteem issues.\n\nA normal response would be her thanking you for being there and taking the time to dress up and support her.", "NTA your cousin is incredibly insecure. And frankly your grandma is TAH for not sticking up for you as you did nothing wrong. As my mom always told me-\u201c never hide your light under a bushel\u201d meaning don\u2019t diminish yourself in order to try to help other people feel better about themselves.", "NTA - I 100% guarantee that you did not outshine her at the wedding. She likely just saw the photos, felt insecure, and made it your problem. You did nothing wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a problem that you can fix because it is not a problem that you caused.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s her.  She\u2019s had a significant life change and she\u2019s probably dealing with a lot of stress.  She seems to have fixated on her wedding photos as a way to vent her stressful feelings.  Give her space to get over her anger at herself.  Hopefully, you guys can move past this but she may feel so embarrassed later that she\u2019ll avoid you.  You should try to touch base with her in a few weeks and see if she feels better.", "NTA. She approved the dress and if makeup wasn\u2019t allowed at the wedding that should have been mentioned (that would\u2019ve been weird tho). She is taking her insecurity out on you.", "NTA. \n\nSheesh. She's looking for drama, couldn't find any, so decided to make some.", "I'm sorry, did you do your makeup like Gene Simmons? Trixie Mattel? Bozo?\n\nNTA", "NTA.  She sounds deeply insecure but it's not your fault.  She approved of your dress, hair, makeup and only had second thoughts when she saw the photos.  It's not like you wore white or purposely didn't comply with her wishes.\n\nHopefully she'll simmer down.", "NTA. She's an adult and she has glaring issues which should not have been projected onto you. It wasn't right for your grandma to tolerate it, too.\n\nI'm glad you looked great, OP. don't mind the haters lol. you didn't do anything outta the line.", "NTA- I wonder if a photo it shows someone checking you out someone. She doesn't like checking you out.\n\nSomething feels off.  Or someone said something to her.\nStill NTA-", "The aunt, I've tried nothing to better myself and I'm all out of ideas haha", "NTA and I\u2019m so tired of these insecure brides that think other women should look extra frumpy at their weddings. No one is being pretty *at* you.", "your aunt wasn't angry until he phots came back.\n\nHer memories of the day are what should count. \n\nThey all approved of the dress, no mention was made of the makeup on the day.\n\nI bet on the day, you were not gathering unwanted attention.  The attention, the spotlight, was on the bride and groom.\n\nFor anyone to be angry because you look beautiful in the photos is unrealistic.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate that her insecurity is putting a wedge in your relationship. You had her approve the dress, you are not a mind reader and it was on her to ask you to find another dress if she really didn\u2019t approve. She needed to clearly communicate what she wanted make up & hair wise. I don\u2019t think your aunt is an AH either because our insecurities can wreak havoc on our mental health. Give her some space to see if she will calm down and if not talk to another trusted adult about this.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve known to wear your potato sack and clown makeup to the wedding and not upstage anyone by looking good.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get she\u2019s insecure, but she shouldn\u2019t have been that angry over a small misunderstanding, and does it really matter if you look slightly better than her?", "You are NTA for existing as a 16 year old girl. She is mad at you for being- in her mind only- younger and prettier than her. The truth is that no one outshines a bride unless she lets them in her own mind. Weddings are supposed to be about sharing an important life event with loved ones. It's not supposed to be perfect. Just joyful. The facts are that within a year, those pictures will be stored on a shelf or in a box and no one will look at them, or care. She will get over her insecurity someday.", "NTA. She approved of everything until she got her pictures back and saw you in them. She sounds like she has pretty low self esteem and is jealous of your looks. That is something she needs to work on for herself. You did nothing wrong and there\u2019s nothing you can do to fix this. It\u2019s on her.", "Are you sure she's not the teenager and you the adult? NTA", "NTA\n\nHer insecurities are not your responsibility.", "Please tell me that OPs age is a typo and auntie dearest is not actually projecting all her insecurities on a teenage girl.", "NTA. First, you\u2019re a child. Like, close to becoming an adult, but still a child. What that means in this situation is that her focusing on you being pretty is - look, you\u2019re close and there\u2019s a long history of the American fetishization of youth and impossible beauty standards and people reading Lolita wrong so I\u2019m just gonna say it\u2019s meh and mostly a her problem. \n\nBut second and more importantly, you being a child means that you are still LEARNING the things you should know, and need teachers. If she didn\u2019t feel up to having that conversation with you before the wedding she should have asked someone else to talk to you. And honestly curled hair and some makeup would generally be appropriate? Like. You want to look like you out in effort to celebrate a loved one\u2019s marriage. For some people putting in effort might consist of locating a comb, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re one of those people. Your post doesn\u2019t show any malice, so it doesn\u2019t sound like you did anything wrong. They should have talked to you beforehand if they had specific expectations, and your aunt should stop comparing herself to you", "NTA. She doesn't like how she looks in the pictures and is taking it out on you.", "Nta. Her insecurity makes her ugly. She needs therapy and you need to not talk to her until she apologizes at you for merely existing.", "NTA, hopefully your aunt will apologize to you and this won't be typical behavior for her. It's very weird for an adult to see a literal teenager as competition. You aren't at fault, especially when she approved of everything beforehand.", "NTA\n\nThis is some jealous, insecure, women hating women nonsense. Your aunt is being ridiculous.\n\nYou acted perfectly appropriately, and she didn't even seem to think anything was wrong with how you looked on the day. It's no one's fault if you looked better than her, according to her. She approved your dress, and anyone and everyone would wear makeup and do their hair for a wedding.\n\nHer reactions is a lot more about her than it does about you.", "NTA. She didn't realize how good you looked until she saw pictures to prove it and now she's backtracking.", "Mate you have done nothing wrong. Your aunt is (very wrongly) taking her insecurities out on you. She is 25 years old and should be a lot more mature than she is heaping her drama onto a child. She has no right. Do not apologise to her again. Involve your parents because I hope someone in your family has the intelligence to stop pandering to a grown arse adult bullying a child. Your aunts behaviour is disgusting and your grandmother is not much better. \n\nNTA.", "It's so creepy, she's jealous of a CHILD for godssakes. How pathetically insecure.", "She didn\u2019t have any issues UNTIL she saw the pictures. If anything, that makes it creepier", "LOL", "Oh my god, I missed the ages. How incredibly fucked up"]}
