Right after the proposal she asked me to be her bridesmaid and I very excitedly say yes! A while later we start dress shopping and me along with all the other bridesmaids go to a bridal store to pick out dresses all with the same requirements: they had to be sapphire blue and have a slit. I ended up finding a very pretty dark sapphire blue dress that went well with my eyes and fit me very nicely. My aunt approved it and I though all was well, until the wedding. \n\nThe day of the wedding I did my makeup as nice as I could and did my own hair as well, i\u2019m not very good at hair so i just curled it. The wedding was beautiful, my aunt looked beautiful, and no problems actually occurred at or on the wedding day. It was after. \n\nA bit later my aunt got her wedding photos back and I could tell she was angry with me through my grandma and the fact she was reluctant to share these photos with me. I didn\u2019t confront her about it because i was confused but my grandma called me to tell me i should talk to her so i did. I called her and asked her if she was upset with me and she said that i knew what i did upstaging her at her wedding. i was very confused at this point but for a bit more context i\u2019m in shape and am pretty stereotypically attractive. My aunt, who is also very pretty, is kinda insecure and slightly overweight, but i have always found her very pretty nonetheless. She told me that I should never have worn makeup because I knew that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for her to look good next to me. \n\nShe never told me not to wear makeup or do my hair or anything like that otherwise i really wouldn\u2019t have. She also said something about my dress saying i should have picked one out with less of a slit because of my long legs. I would\u2019ve gladly done this had she told me to. I tried to explain to her that i didn\u2019t mean to upset her and assured her she looked gorgeous all day, but i also told her if she didn\u2019t want me doing that stuff or wearing that dress she should have told me. she just told me back that \u201ci should\u2019ve known\u201d and i just don\u2019t understand if i\u2019m missing something here or what. i don\u2019t want this to be a big thing but my grandma is upset with me and so is my aunt idk what to do.\ncan somebody help?\naita?", "created_utc": 1691115687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hnfuf/aita_for_outshining_my_aunt_at_her_wedding/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She sounds extremely immature.", "NTA.\n\nShe approved of the dress, and obviously saw your makeup before the wedding and didn\u2019t say a single thing.

You did nothing wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not a problem that you can fix because it is not a problem that you caused.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s her.  She\u2019s had a significant life change and she\u2019s probably dealing with a lot of stress.  She seems to have fixated on her wedding photos as a way to vent her stressful feelings.  Give her space to get over her anger at herself.  Hopefully, you guys can move past this but she may feel so embarrassed later that she\u2019ll avoid you.  You should try to touch base with her in a few weeks and see if she feels better.", "NTA.

It\u2019s unfortunate that her insecurity is putting a wedge in your relationship.

She needed to clearly communicate what she wanted make up & hair wise. I don\u2019t think your aunt is an AH either because our insecurities can wreak havoc on our mental health.

I get she\u2019s insecure, but she shouldn\u2019t have been that angry over a small misunderstanding, and does it really matter if you look slightly better than her?", "You are NTA for existing as a 16 year old girl. She is mad at you for being- in her mind only- younger and prettier than her. The truth is that no one outshines a bride unless she lets them in her own mind. Weddings are supposed to be about sharing an important life event with loved ones. It's not supposed to be perfect. Just joyful. The facts are that within a year, those pictures will be stored on a shelf or in a box and no one will look at them, or care. She will get over her insecurity someday.", "NTA. She approved of everything until she got her pictures back and saw you in them. She sounds like she has pretty low self esteem and is jealous of your looks. That is something she needs to work on for herself. You did nothing wrong and there\u2019s nothing you can do to fix this. It\u2019s on her.", "Are you sure she's not the teenager and you the adult? NTA", "NTA\n\nHer insecurities are not your responsibility.", "Please tell me that OPs age is a typo and auntie dearest is not actually projecting all her insecurities on a teenage girl.", "NTA. First, you\u2019re a child. Like, close to becoming an adult, but still a child. What that means in this situation is that her focusing on you being pretty is - look, you\u2019re close and there\u2019s a long history of the American fetishization of youth and impossible beauty standards and people reading Lolita wrong so I\u2019m just gonna say it\u2019s meh and mostly a her problem. \n\nBut second and more importantly, you being a child means that you are still LEARNING the things you should know, and need teachers. If she didn\u2019t feel up to having that conversation with you before the wedding she should have asked someone else to talk to you. And honestly curled hair and some makeup would generally be appropriate? Like. You want to look like you out in effort to celebrate a loved one\u2019s marriage. For some people putting in effort might consist of locating a comb, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re one of those people.

She needs therapy and you need to not talk to her until she apologizes at you for merely existing.", "NTA, hopefully your aunt will apologize to you and this won't be typical behavior for her. It's very weird for an adult to see a literal teenager as competition. You aren't at fault, especially when she approved of everything beforehand.", "NTA\n\nThis is some jealous, insecure, women hating women nonsense. Your aunt is being ridiculous.\n\nYou acted perfectly appropriately, and she didn't even seem to think anything was wrong with how you looked on the day. It's no one's fault if you looked better than her, according to her.

She didn't realize how good you looked until she saw pictures to prove it and now she's backtracking.", "Mate you have done nothing wrong. Your aunt is (very wrongly) taking her insecurities out on you. She is 25 years old and should be a lot more mature than she is heaping her drama onto a child. She has no right. Do not apologise to her again. Involve your parents because I hope someone in your family has the intelligence to stop pandering to a grown arse adult bullying a child.

That sounds like she has some self-esteem stuff going on, and it's a pity she's putting it on you. It's also a pity that other people in the family are enabling her in this.

She needs to work on her insecurities and not put them on you.", "NTA you had no way of knowing not to wear makeup or style your hair and she literally approved the dress before hand.

It was only after the fact that the bride started having a problem.", "NTA but I can see how she got there - the world really puts its back into making women insecure about their looks and their size, and then they tell them they MUST be the prettiest woman at their ball. \n\nTell her she's by far the most beautiful woman in her photographs because she's the happiest and the most in love, and that that shines off her like a halo, and you wearing an inch of makeup and a split that goes right up to your armpit isn't going to come close, and that you could have been wearing Katy Perry's giant burger dress and STILL not a single eye would have been on you at that wedding.", "NTA and it's so sad that instead of being a happy newlywed, your aunt is acting like an insecure little girl. You have nothing to apologize for. It's on her to get over.", "This sounds like it started because in looking at the pictures, she saw how photogenic you are.

But they\u2019re the only photos she\u2019s ever going to have of that event, and she can\u2019t go back and re-do them, and even if she could, she *still* might not look the way she hoped she would. \n\nShe needed something to blame for her disappointment, and she landed on you. I\u2019m guessing because the way *you* looked in the photos is closer to the way she *thought* she would look, and that just feels so unfair. And since *she\u2019s* miserable over it, you should be, too.", "NTA She is just feeling very insecure.", "NTA\n\nFirst, she accepted the dress before.

You did not deliberately attempt to outshine her, and she approved the dress you chose, which met her requirements. You are not a mind reader and could not have known she would react like this. Aunt can justify it all she wants and Grandma can defend her all she wants. They are in the wrong and are acting irrational.", "NTA. You did everything right! And when being in a wedding, the default is at least SOME make-up. If you hadn't worn make up she probably would have been pissed off at your for not making and effort. The pictures just made her insecure - some people photograph particularly well and others don't, and it's not necessarily a true reflection of what they look like in life. Ever seen a supermodel in real life with no/low make up? They often don't look like what you'd think!\n\nYour aunt is letting her own insecurities get to her and your grandma is taking her side because she's older and \"the bride\". There may not be much you can do but let it blow over, but but just because they are mad at you doesn't make them right. Sometimes in life people will be mad at you for no good reason and there is NOTHING you can do to stop it. And it sucks. But all you can do is tell yourself that it's not really about you (it's about them and their own issues) and let it be. And maybe reevaluate how close of a relationship you want with them.", "NTA at all. You can\u2019t win with someone like this, they\u2019re insecure and jealous. She should have been proud of you. \n\nMy bestfriend (family I\u2019ve chosen) is stunning. I couldn\u2019t be more proud to stand next to her! I proudly stand next to the bestie and all the family, they have great genes, like cheek bones, eyes, features, the lot. They\u2019d come to my wedding looking like royalty (not British royalty, think queen of Bhutan or Jordan) and I\u2019ll be like yeah this my fam - (we) the squad look good. If you\u2019re competing with your family, you\u2019ll always be a loser", "As someone who does typically wear make-up - I would frankly consider it a bit rude / low effort not to put make-up on for a wedding I am in!\n\nOfc I\u2019m not saying that bridal party members must wear make-up - I have friends that typically don\u2019t and I wouldn\u2019t take any offence if they didn\u2019t. But, yeah, if you\u2019re someone who typically does, not wearing it is a bit like showing up to a formal wedding in casual slacks or something.
