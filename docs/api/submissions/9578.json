We didn't kick them out to be clear, they both seperately chose to move out when they could afford to after college. With the way housing is these day's they were welcome to stay indefinitely. Our daughter moved out 2 years ago.\n\nThe thing is my wife and I are naturists, we don't really like to wear clothes inside the house. We first got into the lifestyle 10 years ago, but obviously couldn't really practice it much with children in the house. But now that we're empty nesters we wanted to give it a try. We had a bit of an awkward talk with the kids after our son \"caught us in the act\" last year when he swung by unannouced, and they seem to accept it.\n\nThe issue came up last thanksgiving. Our children, and our sons fiance, wanted to stay at our place a couple nights while they were in town for thanksgiving at my brothers house. They were more than welcome to stay, but we told them we weren't taking time off from our lifestyle. We would be doing our normal routine while at the house, I.E. no clothes.\n\nOur son tried to argue that it was a little silly for us to not just put some pants on for 2 nights, but it's our house. Our daughter took our side, and stayed, but our son and his fiance got a hotel. I don't think we did anything wrong, but thanksgiving was awkward since word got around. My brother even pulled me aside and said I was being unreasonable. My wife agrees with the stance we took still, but is upset and thinks this may have contributed to our son going to his future in-laws for christmas.", "created_utc": 1675987179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yak6b/aita_for_refusing_to_change_our_lifestyle_when/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And good on your daughter for deciding to accept it. \n\nI struggle to grasp how you would choose to do this knowing your relationship with your son and his fianc\u00e9 are being affected. It wasn\u2019t just your own flesh and blood children you were willing to make uncomfortable, but your sons fianc\u00e9 as well. So are you nude for all guests? Because his fianc\u00e9 was a guest!! For two days you couldn\u2019t put clothes on? \n\nYou do understand your decision to die on this hill could affect your relationship with any future grandchildren from your son and his wife too don\u2019t you? That by making them uncomfortable, and refusing to put clothes on while you had guests in your home will more than likely impact any decision they have about letting their children visit you. \n\nOh, and as far as Christmas was concerned, yeah it could have been the no clothes thing. It could also be because they now have to split time between two families and since you got thanksgiving they got Christmas.", "YTA I have a question, are you and your partner planning on being naturalists when your children decide to have kids?  What do you do when you have a party at your house?

That makes them guests.  Which means it falls on you to be a gracious host.\n\nPlus, these are your kids, and your son's fiance.  And you're making a point of making all of them feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.\n\nThat is not how a loving parent acts.  A loving parent welcomes it when their adult children visit, and makes an effort so everyone can be comfortable and have a good time. \n\nYou are a parent who cares more about running around naked than spending time with your own children.  That makes you an AH parent. \n\nIf a stranger showed up, unannounced, they might be surprised, and they'd need to be polite and deal with it, because they showed up without warning.  But when someone you care about plans a visit, you need to plan to make them welcome and comfortable, if you want to maintain your relationship with them. \n\nDon't expect visits from your kids in the future, if you won't make even a slight effort to be  a welcoming host.", "YTA. If a man I was dating brought me to see his parents in the nude I would hightail it out of there like my buns were on fire. You are correct, it's your house. Be nude.

And he won't be uncomfortable at thier home as a guest\n\n\nAnd I know  a married couple whose children cut them out of thier lives  Becuase they decided that if they couldn't accept them being nudists. Then they didn't have to come around. So guess who said Okay and never looked back. \n\nNow they post on social media how thier own children Basically told them to Get Lost and to never talk to them again. Thier own grandchildren don't even know that set of grandparents. And that's how it has been for the past 15 years.\n\nAnd the kids did make a comment on that post and said if only they would put on clothes when we would vist for a few hours or days  it would have been a different story.

You and your wife really can't manage some loose clothing at home for two days in order to spend time with your family?", "YTA.\n\nYou presumably put clothing on to go grocery shopping and run other errands. But you weren't willing to do the same for two days as a courtesy to your son and future daughter in law. That demonstrates a callous disregard for them.\n\nIn fact, your actions conveyed that you prefer they not be around you.\n\nIMO, they're being more considerate toward you than you were toward them.\n\nYour brother is right. You were unreasonable. Your wife must be living in an alternate reality if she doesn't acknowledge that the two of you are responsible for putting distance between yourselves and your son.", "YTA. Wtf, are you two years old? Your desire to parade your bodies to your kids I'd bizarre. If they grew up with this as part of their culture, it would be different.  You can't possibly be clueless enough to not be aware of how uncomfortable this would make them, so it's obviously your intent to repel your children.

And who wants to sit in a chair after you've had your leaky, naked old ass on it.", "YTA\n\nSure, by \"rule of law\", it's your house and your rules and you should be able to do whatever you want. But there's also common courtesy.\n\nAnd if you can wear clothes when you go outside of the house, you can spend a couple of days being dressed while there are visitors there. \n\nAlso, are you planning on being naked around your future grandkids? Cause that would be a hard line for me.", "For me, it just feels like a weird hill to die on. \n\nWhile I respect your lifestyle choices, and you're correct, you do have a right to dictate what happens in your home, it is understandable that your son would feel uncomfortable returning to your home when you're doing this, and realistically, it wouldn't kill you to refrain for a day or two for the sake of quality time with your family. \n\nWhile they no longer live there, it was still the family home and a place they grew up and felt safe in. \n\nI suppose largely NAH, borderline soft YTA for me. I just think personally, spending rare, quality time with my kids would trump the need to wonder around naked constantly, especially when it is for such a short amount of time. \n\nSon has every right to choose not to stay with you for Christmas. If you wish to do something like that, which would be uncomfortable for most people's children, then you can expect them to make decisions to spend time elsewhere, where they won't feel uncomfortable. And do not be surprised if their resentment grows should you choose to prioritise that lifestyle over that quality time.", "I mean I guess technically NTA. You're allowed to do what you want in your own house.  But is this REALLY a hill worth dying on?

And don't be shocked if this isn't the last time your son chooses not to do holidays with you. Especially if he and his fiancee eventually have kids. I wouldn't want to risk exposing kids to your lifestyle.", "Make it a toga party and wear sheets or something as a compromise if you want your son to visit you again. Your lifestyle is fine, just don\u2019t expect others to want to see it, and in this case I\u2019m not sure who this is more uncomfortable for, your son (very few grown up kids are a-ok with seeing their parents naked) or his partner who isn\u2019t even related to you, therefore probably even LESS comfortable with the situation, and as a non-family member also less likely to speak up about that. YTA in this case.", "YTA, I can't believe you are letting pants get in the way of your relationship with your child. That should easily be more important to you.", "Pretty selfish actually,  so YTA.

What harm is it gonna be to put clothes on for 2 or 3 days. Life is about compromise and if you love your son and want him to be comfortable, doesn't seem like it takes too much effort to throw a shirt in some jeans on for a couple days.", "Wait so you thought it would be ok for you and your wife to not only be around your kids naked, but also your son's fiance? If you want to do that then go for it, but you can't then be all butt hurt that your son wanted to spend the holidays with their in-laws. It's your house but you can't then expect people to want to be around if you insist on being naked. So yeah yta.", "YTA. It's a weird hill to die on, gotta be honest. It isn't for moral, religious, or ethical cause, so refusing to accommodate someone (and not just someone - your child) for barely 48 hours is asshole behaviour.", "YTA \n\nI think you need to be prepared for your son to choose to spend every holiday with his girlfriend\u2019s family if you keep this up.", "NAH\n\nIts your house so your rules for sure.\n\nBut as you've found out, its going to affect your relationship with your son and his fiance and your wife has no right to get upset that they've decided not to visit at your house in the future.

I mean your home is free reign when you're both alone--don't get me wrong...but really? Your kids are basically begging you to accommodate for them.\n\nCan't you find some common ground with, like, a bathrobe? Or loose fitting pajamas? Definitely not fair to your son, as they probably hate distancing themselves but can't justify the discomfort/social backlash of your new lifestyle. Now, unless your daughter is a \"naturalist,\" too--I'd put my money on the fact that she probably feels similar about the situation. She likely can't justify shunning it because (now, I'm assuming this since it wasn't mentioned in the post) she is single and doesn't have to involve a 3rd party like your son does with his fianc\u00e9. She is being supportive, but I bet that it'd be a a different story if she also had a partner she had to navigate this situation with.", "YTA. - So generally I am all for living your truth; and if that is to not wear clothes then go for it. But given the nature of being naked it seems like something you could pause while other people are around. Especially your kids, they really don\u2019t want to see you two naked.

If you want to have a normal relationship with them where they come over and stay during the holidays- then put some clothes on.", "YTA\n\nYou have every right to be naked but your son told you it makes him (and I'm guessing more pertinently his partner) uncomfortable.

I do not think it is appropriate to invite them into your home this way.  Your children were not raised this way and you should never expect them to accept this on a visit.

It's also completely reasonable for them to choose to stay in a hotel. That it makes them uncomfortable is unfortunate, but it is what it is.\n\nAnd I think you're right in your assumption that it probably played a factor in their decision on where to spend Christmas. Your choice to be naturists in your home, whilst reasonable, has consequences. On the plus side, it's probably not too late to revisit your choice.\n\nYou have a decision to make as to what is more important to you. Being naked in your home around the holidays or being a little uncomfortable in clothes so your son and his fianc\u00e9 will come and stay with you. Neither choice would make you an asshole, they're both equally reasonable, as long as you accept the consequences of your choice.\n\nNow, you would be the asshole if you blamed your son and his fianc\u00e9 for not staying with you whilst you are naked. You would be the asshole if you insisted they visit for both holidays regardless of your life choices. But so long as you respect their choice to not stay with you, to not visit as often because they're uncomfortable, and don't try to force the situation, then nobody is being an asshole. This is just some grown-ups making choices and living with the consequences of those choices.\n\nNAH", "INFO\n\n> my wife and I are naturists, we don't really like to wear clothes inside the house\n\nWouldn't the more nature-embracing thing be to not live in a *house* at all?", "NAH - But what are you going to do when grandkids enter the picture?

We didn't kick them out to be clear, they both seperately chose to move out when they could afford to after college. With the way housing is these day's they were welcome to stay indefinitely. Our daughter moved out 2 years ago.\n\nThe thing is my wife and I are naturists, we don't really like to wear clothes inside the house. We first got into the lifestyle 10 years ago, but obviously couldn't really practice it much with children in the house. But now that we're empty nesters we wanted to give it a try. We had a bit of an awkward talk with the kids after our son \"caught us in the act\" last year when he swung by unannouced, and they seem to accept it.\n\nThe issue came up last thanksgiving. Our children, and our sons fiance, wanted to stay at our place a couple nights while they were in town for thanksgiving at my brothers house. They were more than welcome to stay, but we told them we weren't taking time off from our lifestyle. We would be doing our normal routine while at the house, I.E. no clothes.\n\nOur son tried to argue that it was a little silly for us to not just put some pants on for 2 nights, but it's our house. Our daughter took our side, and stayed, but our son and his fiance got a hotel. I don't think we did anything wrong, but thanksgiving was awkward since word got around. My brother even pulled me aside and said I was being unreasonable. My wife agrees with the stance we took still, but is upset and thinks this may have contributed to our son going to his future in-laws for christmas.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
