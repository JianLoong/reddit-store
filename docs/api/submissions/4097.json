I hope you find a different place to work.", "I'd be willing to bet that a large number of your housed co-workers use drugs and alcohol. But somehow it's only a problem if someone is poor.

Honestly it\u2019s wonderful what you were doing but obviously people have been having issues with it.", "I hate to say it because your kindness obviously had a positive impact on his life, but I think you're very lightly the AH. It's not really appropriate to bring someone who smells and has behaviors that other people know (I assume from speaking to/seeing him outside, if he's regularly outside the building?) are possibly a result of drug use into a workplace. \n\nIf you had a coworker who neglected their hygiene and it bugged people, HR would tell them to fix it. If you had a coworker who was known to be a drug user who started behaving oddly and freaking people out, HR would fire them. They can't do that with him because he's not an employee, but you *brought him into the workplace knowing these things*. I feel like it should have been obvious that you shouldn't have guests who aren't either related to you or also professionals, even if it wasn't an actual rule.\n\nEdit: I reread what you wrote and it doesn't sound like his behavior was scary at all, or that he was using drugs at the time? The main thing is that his hygiene and appearance obviously violated workplace norms, then, plus the fact that the workplace canteen is probably not the right venue to try mass exposure therapy to reduce societal stigma/fear of the homeless.", "You even questioned it yourself. I\u2019m going with NTA but also just not situationally aware. Keep having lunch with him, just not at the office. If there is a public park or a picnic table outside that you can sit with him at then do that. \n\nYou are comfortable with him because you have a relationship with him, other people there don\u2019t. He has dirty clothes and doesn\u2019t bathe regularly so he does smell, even if it isn\u2019t disgusting it is going to make people uncomfortable. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a restaurant you are inviting him into buy him lunch, it\u2019s your place of employment. \n\nI applaud your heart and your selfless love for your fellow human, but your workplace isn\u2019t the best venue to express that (unfortunately).", "Do you realize how bigoted you sound. Like did you take a step back and realize just how hateful you sound. You're literally using the same fucked up logic the KKK and neo nazis used to defend their unreasonable hatred towards other groups of people. I'm sorry for your ignorance pal.", "Unfortunately some people think that anyone who is homeless has to also be a drug user. It\u2019s a prejudiced view and part of why they didn\u2019t want him around.", "Which is extremely ironic, given that many housed and employed people are also users of drugs and alcohol.", "I would say soft YTA/ESH. \n\nYou\u2019re so kind to offer this generous offer to someone who really needs the help and support, but I don\u2019t think the environment should have been inside your workplace with your co-workers around. The age old mantra of \u201cDon\u2019t shit where you eat\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of those things where while you were definitely helping someone unfortunate, it has a impact on your professional life, maybe to an extent affect your employment and the views of superiors. Is that reasoning shitty and unfair? Absolutely. But can it happen? Yes. \n\nEspecially an environment with kid\u2019s potentially around, it can heighten the sensitivity of the risk of you bringing him in, maybe even to the point of losing your job. Best thing to possibly do it to try and give him food and support outside of it, separately so it won\u2019t impact as much", "YTA I\u2019m actually shocked by all the other judgements you\u2019re getting.

It doesn't matter that he's soon to be no longer homeless, or that it doesn't violate written rules: what matters is management as warned you that this is unprofessional and basically not to bring him back. If you try to do so, or argue it too much, you will be labeled a \"problem employee\" and steps will be made to \"solve the problem\" (ie you). \n\nI'm not saying this to be mean, but to make sure to decide whether or not doing what you think is right is worth your job.", "If the guy really did smell that bad, then YTA. It's normal and acceptable for a restaurant to impose hygiene standards for the comfort of guests and staff. Its lovely of you to provide occasional support for this homeless guy and gosh wouldn't it have been nice for the company to provide him a takeaway meal every now and again.

Personally, I would rather eat my lunch with Rob than your stuck up coworkers", "You're lovely to be doing that and how great that Rob now has housing and a job.

Glad Rob seems to be getting back on his feet.", "But most people that are allowed around kids or you work with have had background checks", "Info: does he smell really badly?  Some homeless people do, and others don't.  My guess is that he doesn't.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nWatch them try and turn it into a PR stunt now that the guy's not homeless. \n\n\"Our staff fed and cared for this man until he was able to secure housing for himself.

Safety questions have been raised and OP has been warned by management: if the person/people see him back and still feel unsafe, and again bring this to management, then it will be OP whose causing trouble. Unless she's absolutely fantastic at work and is bringing them $$, then the company is likely to side with the complainant (especially as she's been warned).

You are so certain someone would get fired for literally telling management they are following the rules.

Again, OP said they checked the rules and found they were within bounds. \n\nIf someone is being treated unfairly and you stand by because you\u2019re too scared to say something, you\u2019re compliant. It\u2019s simple. In this case it is bigotry. This is black and white, no grey area. \n\nOP isn\u2019t going to get fired for bringing a friend in to have lunch with, all in alignment with all the little rules. And yes, I\u2019m a full on adult believe it or not. With some property and bills and taxes to pay and all that great stuff. And believe it or not I\u2019ve lived my life like this the whole time.

Ethically you aren\u2019t wrong and you\u2019re doing something nice for someone who can use a helping hand but you are making yourself a target if you ignore what has been said to you.

It really doesn\u2019t take much for a company to send you packing once they sour on you.

Your workplace is classist and \njudgmental af.", "NTA! How do these people know Rob is on drugs? Are they assuming, because he's homeless? Not all homeless people are a danger to others and themselves. Rob may have fallen on hard times and you have a heart of gold for helping this man.

You were doing a nice thing and I'm sure there's no policy against it. On the flip side I worked in a small office where a co-worker gave out money and food to a couple of local homeless people and it led to issues where we had people trying to break in or waiting outside and being aggressive trying to get more money, which was scary in a small setting where we'd sometimes be working alone. It created a safety risk.", "NTA the world needs more people like you.", "And don't forget they obviously also need a drug test and a pat down to make sure they aren't bringing anything that could be used as a weapon. /s\n\nNTA.

And being homeless does not automatically mean drug user", "What troubles me here is this sectioning off of unhoused folks into spaces deemed \"appropriate\" ie where they won't \"bother\" anyone. They're human beings like the rest of us and deserve equal access to spaces.\n\nLots of corporate employees have BO and addiction issues. Banning the formerly unhoused person who formerly struggled with addiction from coming to lunch once per week isn't going eliminate addiction issues from the workplace.\n\nOP, you're amazing. I don't think your colleagues deserve to work with someone as good-hearted as you.", "They can absolutely restrict who can access the office.

Also it will be read without voice inflection or body language to bolster your meaning. More better to make notes to yourself, go through them thoroughly so when you're in conversation with your boss you don't forget to say everything because you're nervous or upset. \n\nTry to sound contrite for not considering everyone's safety. Point out that Rob will soon be not homeless. (who knows they may not even recognize him once he has better access to shelter) And ask, for your own sake, why people are sure he's a drug addict, because if he is, you may have put your own self in danger by being naive. Been there, done that. Good luck. You have a good heart", "Except now Rob has obtained housing and employment, so if any of those things were issues in the past, they would likely be resolved moving forward. It's about if the company is willing to formally discriminate against unhoused folks or those who were formerly unhoused.", "Ehhhhh I just think anyone who thinks they're above dining alongside an unhoused person is an AH.\n\nI've had male colleagues/bosses smell like BO, be known drug and alcohol abusers, and nobody banned them from company meals.", "These sound like judgmental folks who likely didn't get near or interact with Rob in any way, just people who feel above eating alongside an unhoused person, and are willing to whine about it to management.", "I invite you to consider that since Rob has now secured housing, he will not need a reminder to shower. I don't think we need to be infantalizing him. Let's remember that unhoused folks are people just like the rest of us, and it's lack of access that impedes them.", "It\u2019s a fact homeless populations have high rates of mental illness and/or drug abuse.

It is inhumane and they are terrible, entitled, privileged, awful people.", "This. I was thinking, if the alleged drug use is so obvious, surely OP would have noticed and taken that into consideration when first inviting Rob. I think that the coworkers are being discriminatory and assuming homeless people are all drug users. Now you know who in the office has compassion and critical thinking and who doesn\u2019t.", "I mean, I would be too, because these sound like a bunch of terrible, judgmental people who absolutely lack any compassion.\n\nIf I were OP I'd point out that children are sticky disease vectors and it was unsafe to bring them in as guests for lunch, too."]}
