But as it stands, you're just insisting that this person who OP chooses to spend time with and is friendly with is not his friend. \n\n>The employee canteen is not a soup kitchen.\n\nI never said it was. But that doesn't mean that people without housing are banned from it, nor does it mean that having a friend who is without housing is taking advantage of anything. \n\n>The workplace canteen is for employees. They expanded it to allow employees to invite a friend or family member X times\n\nOf course they did. And if you believe that no one can befriend a homeless person, you're free to continue believing that OP was not following the rules. But I feel like it's pretty clear that OP can in fact befriend a homeless person, and indeed he already has.", "It\u2019s a private space and the owners can set guidelines on who can enter, but you know that\u2026you just don\u2019t like it.", "Of course they can. And they did, and OP made sure to check those guidelines and nothing about the housing status of friends or family brought in as guest was in them. Which you know as well. \n\nThe owners set guidelines but tried to retroactively change them based on a guests appearance, while hiding behind a claim of \"safety\" despite not actually doing anything to ascertain the safe-ness of guests who look more well-off. \n\nOP is NTA.", "NTA But know that if they really want to take it that far they could literally cancel this whole lunch thing and become a lot stricter on everyone because they\u2019re trying to solve this problem you didn\u2019t do anything wrong but just think about that because if some senior manager has the power to cut the free lunches and have it to where no visits can happen during the work place it would suck for everyone else and they might get upset but honestly since dude has gotten Housing and his getting together probably will start looking more the part and hopefully there won\u2019t be any issue but you did was very sweet and you did nothing wrong it is what it is sometimes people get rubbed the wrong way and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it sometime", "YTA. Your friend already came by once already that week per the rules provided by the company. You guys could've gone out for lunch but I feel like you were just thinking about yourself, how you and your friend could get free food off of the company's dime and no regard for how your coworkers would feel about bringing in a homeless personin the place of business. I think your heart is in the right place, but you just need to be more considerate of the people you work with. The company is being nice by extending the courtesy to guests of employees, but I feel like situations like this is what makes companies put in place further restrictions.", "Is he a drug addict?  Does he smell exceptionally bad?  Or is just the very sight of a less fortunate person distressing to your coworkers?  Honestly if he\u2019s filthy and smells bad, he shouldn\u2019t be there.  If he\u2019s kind of shabby/ unkempt but clean I think that\u2019s different.  \nIt certainly sounds like this man is making an effort to improve his situation and that you\u2019ve been a positive influence.", "Should had said he not homeless. He just got housing.. and a job.. Can't help it they judging my friend on his looks", "Does he stink? Can you bring lunch out to him?", "NTA - you are an honorable person. You also seem like the type that wouldnt invite someone who is actually a hazard. You have inadvertently helped this dude get a job and housing through your kindness. Good job my dude", "NTA you have a heart of gold and wish more people showed a sliver of compassion you are showing every week. You've done nothing wrong and other comments have eloquently stated what you can yell management. \n\nBest of luck to you and Rob.", "NTA!  That is your friend.  Tell your work they can\u2019t pick and choose your friends.", "Please update us as I want to know what happens after this.", "Dont.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is about the comfort of guests and employes, and about image. And: Is he bathed, in clean clothes in a reasonable state? With a reasonable shave and haircut, reasonably clean hands? If you want to brring him for dinner, take him home (or to a hotel) and buy him clothes, and help him clean up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But I think I\u2019ll confirm with my manager that I intend to keep bringing him in once a week and that their concerns no longer apply since he\u2019s no longer homeless.\" .. Again: If he is bathed, in clean clothes, smells nice and looks respectable, that is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have been warned once over your lack of judgement, if you insist you will lose your job over this. Trying to be nice is ok, but you are doing it at the cost of your employer. If this is THATimportant, take him for dinner somewhere else. The next complaint WILL have consequences for you.", "You are undoubtedly well intentioned, but I would caution you that this will not go well for you. You have been asked to stop it, and you should. Take your friend somewhere else for lunch. Not nice, not fair, but if you want to keep your job don't listen to a random redditors trying to use you to make a social justice point.", "Those people deserve the eff you tho.\n\nThey assume because he was homeless that he was on drugs and has mental health issues and was violent. They had no proof of that! Not all of the unhoused population fit those stigmas and it\u2019s just plain discrimination. There are lots of kind, friendly, and stable people who experience the misfortune of being unhoused.", "You DO understand this was not about him, but a complaint about YOU bringing him in? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis was a WARNING for YOU. Your boss will likely tell you to use your judgement. And with the next complait about you, there will be consequences. And there are two options: firing you, or taking the \"bring a guest\" privilege away from you, or from all employes. Both will end your career opportunities there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you really willing to risk your job over this, when you can take him to dinner somewhere else?", "If you want to pick a fight with a bunch of coworkers, go right ahead.  \n\nI didn't say she was wrong, but I just don't know if this is the kind of battle its smart to pick.  Sometimes you go along to get along.  Especially with coworkers.  Because those people can make your life difficult.", "YOu probably still don't bring them to your workplace?", "I agree with that, I\u2019m just also saying sometimes people deserve to get the eff you.", "If OP is willing to do an \"F you, I am out\"... THEN this behavior MIGHT make sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut if he were willing to do that, it would make much more sense just to quit without causing drama."]}
