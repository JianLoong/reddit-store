We are both only children and grew up three houses down from each other. When we were younger we started this tradition of having movie marathons once a month, we're both huge nerds. \n\nToday we live about an hour away from each other in different cities but we've kept up with our tradition. We take turns holding a movie marathon day/night and this time it was my cousin's turn to host it.\n\nMy cousin lives in a three room apartment with his girlfriend (F26) and I've always gotten along with her as far as I'm aware. This would be the first time she was home during one of our marathons but I didn't mind if she joined us, like I said I thought we were good.\n\nIt was that time of month for me but I didn't think much about it. I had pads with me and I had my own beddings at my cousin's place, as well as a towel to sleep on in case of an accident. I usually sleep on the couch in my cousin's office when I visit so no big deal.\n\nThe day went great, we had decided to watch some Star Trek and his girlfriend would Check on us from time to time but started that she wasn't a fan of sci fi.\n\nThe morning after I was woken up by yelling and quickly got up to see what was going on.\nTurns out the girlfriend had found one of my used pads in the bathroom trash can and she wasn't happy about it.\n\nShe came at me quite aggressively and asked why I hadn\u2019t told her that I was on my period and how grose it was that I just threw my pads in the Trash.\nNow I'm not the most Zen person so I did raise my voice at her, asked her what the fuck she was on about and why it was such a big deal.\nShe started crying and even though my cousin didn't ask me too I felt I should leave. Took an early train home and now I'm sitting in my apartment getting bombarded by messages.\n\nI've gotten some harsh texts from the girlfriend's friends and even a couple of family members telling me I should have told her I was on my period and I was an asshole for yelling at her and making her cry.\n\n\nI've been known to be pretty ignorant when it comes to social cews and norms so I might be completely wrong in this but I wanted to get some opinions from some strangers on the internet before I do any apologizing. \n\nSo.. AITA?\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: \nI talked with my cousin and he explained what happened before I woke up.\nApparently his girlfriend had asked him if he knew I was on my period because she had seen my pad in the trash can (yes, I wrapped it up before throwing it away).\nMy cousin said something like \"Oh, that's why OP hogged all the chocolate, we should have some pain killers if she needs them but knowing OP she probably brought a whole pharmacy with her.\"\n\nThis set his girlfriend off Apparently, she asked him why he was okay with that and why he was so casual with it.\nHe replied that it's not like it's something weird and unnatural.\n\nThat's when she started screaming and when I came out.\n\n\nSome more info:\n\n1, Her friends contacted me through Facebook messenger so they don't have my number. \n\n2, the trashcan had a lid on it\n\n3, the family members that reached out to me about the situation aren't people I'm very close to.\n\n4, My cousin's at work right now but he said he will have a discussion with his girlfriend once he gets home and get back to me later.", "created_utc": 1697695842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bc9qf/aita_for_not_telling_my_cousins_girlfriend_i_was/", "score": 1080, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Oh so you're aware, I'm on my period right now.\" I mean, I've had girlfriends tell me before but that was concerning a specific context that was a little bit more than just staying overnight for a movie marathon.\n\nNTA", "INFO\n\nThis is weird.

That is its purpose.\n\nIf I had a guest and they left a sanitary product on top, with the lid off, and it grossed me out - I would empty the trash and never mention it because I'm a decent member of society and period shaming is unacceptable by at least a century.\n\nYour problem is your cousin's girl does not like you. She has found a way to object to you without admitting what lame jealous bullshit is actually eating her up.\n\nTell he flying monkeys that your culture gave up period huts several generations ago, it is considered rude in your culture this century to ask women about their menstrual cycle, and that the yelling was done by her and they are very much on the wrong side of this argument.", "NTA\n\nThis is the most bizarre reasoning I've ever seen in my life, unless it's some cultural thing I don't know about, which it doesn't seem like it is, she had one weird freakout on you lmao", "NTA.

What does SHE do with her used products? I'm a dude but even I know you aren't supposed to flush them.

Girlfriend has issues with what it means being a woman. \n\nObviously, NTA", "Im sorry, what did i just read????\n\nWere you meant to announce your cycle to her as soon as you got to the house?

I would have yelled at her too", "NTA. It's absurd when men get all bent out of shape about a wrapped pad or tampon in the bathroom trash. For a woman to do so is some pretty serious internalized misogyny. That's where it has to go, ffs! Can't be flushed, and for sure, someone who freaks out at the idea of them in the trash isn't going to want them on the sink or something. \n\nHonestly, after the initial bewilderment at the utter stupidity of being chewed out because I didn't announce I was on my period I would have been laughing my ass off so hard in her face that I'd probably give myself an asthma attack.", "Your cousin's girlfriend is the one with social norm problems here. Her behavior was incredibly rude and bizarre. Periods happen. People go places when they have their periods. When they do, they throw out their products. That's life and not a surprise to most people. I have never heard any person announce their menstrual status on arrival.", "It will be no problem as long as you've wrapped it b4 throw it in the bin, even tho you did not, most of my friends would be like asked you secretly not to do this again next time.

You don't have to announce it to the world. If someone sifts through the garbage and they find a bloody pad, that's on them.", "Flag on the play. What was the alternative for what to do with your pads? Seriously? Is there some secret place one puts them? Or is it that she uses tampons and flushes them? I just. No. I have never had a guest, family or otherwise announce to me or to my partners \u201coh and by the way..\u201d so yea I have no idea what she is on about.", "Nta what the actual fook no right minded person broadcasts their bodily functions the girlfriend is just weird in my opinion", "Wtf. I don't always tell my husband when I'm on my period. \nWhat on earth was she wanting to do with that information?", "NTA. When you\u2019re on your period is none of her business. Why should she know? Where should you put your used pads if not in the trash? What does she do with hers? You\u2019ve got nothing to feel bad about. Or guilty about.", "NTA\n\nFrom now on, every single time you are on your period you should text her to let her know. Every time. Never let up, never give in.

It's a personal thing. \n\nIf anything, I'd be hella weirded out if someone came to my house and said \"oh just so you know I'm on my period\" Uhh???????? Ok? \n\nSo before apologizing (for the sake of the family) try reasoning with them and explaining your POV and ur side of the story. I wouldn't even apologize honestly since she was the one that screamed first then started crying when someone does exact the same.. \n\nThis is why you should treat people same way you want people to treat you.\n\nAnd also the fact that she was so fast to spread those news instead of talking it out with you like an adult speaks volumes IMO.

I'm here and so is my period! \n\n\nPlease may I use your bin? \ud83e\udd7a\n\n\nRidiculous. What else were you supposed to do, take it home with you?", "Is she upset because she can\u2019t have a period or something? But a period isn\u2019t an announcement. The only time your obligated to announce that is if your about to be intimate with someone I would suppose.", "am i the only one who thinks stories like this are fake, especially when they conveniently mention multiple people, family members, friends of friends, are \u201cblowing up their phone\u201d about the situation?", "NTA\n\nHer behavior is really weird and you did nothing wrong, you were very thoughtful and extra careful of any possible mess.

She told me she flushed them and it was gross to put that in the trash. I just looked at her and asked if she\u2019s ever used a public bathroom because there are signs everywhere saying not to flush tampons and pads and it says it on every box you buy. She told me she thought that only applied to the wrapper and plastic. We had issues with our toilets and we assumed the plumbing was messed up from the people that lived there before but it was definitely because she was flushing tampons down the toilet.", "YTA, **only** if you didn't wrap your pad in the wrapper or toilet paper.\n\nNTA if you threw your properly-wrapped pad in the **trash**, where it *goes*, because not everyone can handle the sight of blood.\n\nI fail to understand how it was *any* of her buisness whether or not you were menstruating.

I dont understand what the issue was. So many questions! Why would the gf need to know you are menstruating? Why do all those people have your number? I think she is going through some own personal drama. I dont know, this is just really weird. And where else should you throw the fucking pad if not in the trash? \n\nHowever, as a real fan of menstrual cups, I strongly advise you to start using those, less garbage, more ecological, its cheaper + you def wont have such strange miscommunications anymore. \n\nI hope you can still have movie marathons with your cousin!", "I\u2019ll", "NAH you don't need to announce you're on your period and she doesn't need to see your bloody pad in the trash, you can always put it jn another bag or wrap it in paper then throw it away.\nShe is an AH for making a big deal about it by telling the world and giving your number to her friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
