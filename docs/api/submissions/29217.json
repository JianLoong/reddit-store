{"id": 29217, "submission_id": "17bc9qf", "title": "AITA for not telling my cousin's girlfriend I was on my period?", "selftext": "To preface this, me (F23) and my cousin (M25) have always been really close. We are both only children and grew up three houses down from each other. When we were younger we started this tradition of having movie marathons once a month, we're both huge nerds. \n\nToday we live about an hour away from each other in different cities but we've kept up with our tradition. We take turns holding a movie marathon day/night and this time it was my cousin's turn to host it.\n\nMy cousin lives in a three room apartment with his girlfriend (F26) and I've always gotten along with her as far as I'm aware. This would be the first time she was home during one of our marathons but I didn't mind if she joined us, like I said I thought we were good.\n\nIt was that time of month for me but I didn't think much about it. I had pads with me and I had my own beddings at my cousin's place, as well as a towel to sleep on in case of an accident. I usually sleep on the couch in my cousin's office when I visit so no big deal.\n\nThe day went great, we had decided to watch some Star Trek and his girlfriend would Check on us from time to time but started that she wasn't a fan of sci fi.\n\nThe morning after I was woken up by yelling and quickly got up to see what was going on.\nTurns out the girlfriend had found one of my used pads in the bathroom trash can and she wasn't happy about it.\n\nShe came at me quite aggressively and asked why I hadn\u2019t told her that I was on my period and how grose it was that I just threw my pads in the Trash.\nNow I'm not the most Zen person so I did raise my voice at her, asked her what the fuck she was on about and why it was such a big deal.\nShe started crying and even though my cousin didn't ask me too I felt I should leave. Took an early train home and now I'm sitting in my apartment getting bombarded by messages.\n\nI've gotten some harsh texts from the girlfriend's friends and even a couple of family members telling me I should have told her I was on my period and I was an asshole for yelling at her and making her cry.\n\n\nI've been known to be pretty ignorant when it comes to social cews and norms so I might be completely wrong in this but I wanted to get some opinions from some strangers on the internet before I do any apologizing. \n\nSo.. AITA?\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: \nI talked with my cousin and he explained what happened before I woke up.\nApparently his girlfriend had asked him if he knew I was on my period because she had seen my pad in the trash can (yes, I wrapped it up before throwing it away).\nMy cousin said something like \"Oh, that's why OP hogged all the chocolate, we should have some pain killers if she needs them but knowing OP she probably brought a whole pharmacy with her.\"\n\nThis set his girlfriend off Apparently, she asked him why he was okay with that and why he was so casual with it.\nHe replied that it's not like it's something weird and unnatural.\n\nThat's when she started screaming and when I came out.\n\n\nSome more info:\n\n1, Her friends contacted me through Facebook messenger so they don't have my number. \n\n2, the trashcan had a lid on it\n\n3, the family members that reached out to me about the situation aren't people I'm very close to.\n\n4, My cousin's at work right now but he said he will have a discussion with his girlfriend once he gets home and get back to me later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 2:\n\n'First thing first, HOLY SHIT! I did not expect this many people reading this and even though I can't read every comment I really appreciate it!' \n\n\nSo.. some of you in the comments already pointed it out but it wasn't really about me having my period. \nThe gf confessed she was jealous of our movie marathons and that she thought it was childish?\nApparently she also somehow convinced herself I was hooking up with my cousin in some way (witch.. ew..).\n\nSome of her friends had pointed out how \"weird\" it was for me and my cousin, a man and a woman, to meet up that often and spend the \"night\" together.\nI'm not really sure what she was smoking because first of all we're cousins and second of all she has met my current girlfriend, yes folks, I'm 100% a lesbian. So even though I can admit my cousin is quite a catch I'm not interested in that kind of fish.\n\nI'm not really sure what she hoped to achieve by bringing my period into it but\u2026\n\nShe and my cousin had a huge fight and she left to stay with her parents for a while.\n\nMy cousin resured me our monthly movie marathon nights would continue but that he needed some time to sort himself and this situation out.\n\nPs: I sent him a link to this post so he could read the comments. \n\nSome more info:\n\n1, English is not my first language so yes there will be some spelling errors. \n\n2, I get it now that I wasn't an asshole but I have Autism and ADHD. I have made some major mistakes with social cues and norms in the past and it always makes me really nervous and insecure when people say I did something wrong.\n\n3, Everyone who sent me a bad message about this situation has been blocked because unlike them I don't have time for their shit.", "created_utc": 1697695842, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bc9qf/aita_for_not_telling_my_cousins_girlfriend_i_was/", "score": 5658, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't have to announce it to the world. If someone sifts through the garbage and they find a bloody pad, that's on them.", "Flag on the play. What was the alternative for what to do with your pads? Seriously? Is there some secret place one puts them? Or is it that she uses tampons and flushes them? I just. No. I have never had a guest, family or otherwise announce to me or to my partners \u201coh and by the way..\u201d so yea I have no idea what she is on about.", "Nta what the actual fook no right minded person broadcasts their bodily functions the girlfriend is just weird in my opinion", "Wtf.

Ok? \n\nSo before apologizing (for the sake of the family) try reasoning with them and explaining your POV and ur side of the story. I wouldn't even apologize honestly since she was the one that screamed first then started crying when someone does exact the same.. \n\nThis is why you should treat people same way you want people to treat you.\n\nAnd also the fact that she was so fast to spread those news instead of talking it out with you like an adult speaks volumes IMO.

She told me she flushed them and it was gross to put that in the trash. I just looked at her and asked if she\u2019s ever used a public bathroom because there are signs everywhere saying not to flush tampons and pads and it says it on every box you buy.

I dont understand what the issue was. So many questions! Why would the gf need to know you are menstruating? Why do all those people have your number? I think she is going through some own personal drama. I dont know, this is just really weird. And where else should you throw the fucking pad if not in the trash? \n\nHowever, as a real fan of menstrual cups, I strongly advise you to start using those, less garbage, more ecological, its cheaper + you def wont have such strange miscommunications anymore. \n\nI hope you can still have movie marathons with your cousin!", "I\u2019ll", "NAH you don't need to announce you're on your period and she doesn't need to see your bloody pad in the trash, you can always put it jn another bag or wrap it in paper then throw it away.\nShe is an AH for making a big deal about it by telling the world and giving your number to her friends.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
