{"id": 12773, "submission_id": "11wnj5h", "title": "AITA for telling my stepson I will no longer drive him to school?", "selftext": "I, 31 female, & my fiance 39 male have 2 kids (from his previous marriage) let's call them G 16 male, and P, 13 female. We are having a tough time with our son, G. He will be 17 in May & he REFUSES to take any action toward getting his driver's license. The kids split their time with their mom and us 50/50.  His mom's house is very close to his school, not close enough to walk but close enough for a short bike ride. He is in 11th grade and I take him to his mom's house every morning (the opposite way of my drive to work) so he can then ride his bike to school from there. I then take his sister to school and then drive myself to work. I have done this for the last 5 years. For 2 years they both went to the same school and it was really easy, and also on my way to work. G also plays lacrosse for school, he gets out of school at 2, rides to his mom's house, goes to practice from 4-6:45, then rides back to his mom's house where we pick him up and bring him to our house & then do it all over again the next day. My fiance and I offered to cover the cost of driving school, a permit test, and a cheap car that will get him from A to B. I would think at 17, he would be able to see that this is an opportunity for him to gain independence, also while taking the pressure off of his dad and me playing taxi. He will not take any action on getting his license claiming he's \"not ready\". To add insult to this whole ordeal, he doesn't understand how it's not exactly easy for us to have to schedule our day around his rides, to make sure we are available when he needs to be picked up, change the time I have to leave the house in the morning, and also when we can start making dinner because one of us has to be available to pick him up & get him where he needs to go. This schedule during the school year basically makes it so he sleeps at our house, and the rest of the time he is at his mom's because it's closer to school. So his having his license would also allow us to have more time with him. I talked to my fiance & told him I was going to tell G that I was not going to be driving him to his mom's house every morning next year & that if he does not get his driver's license that he was going to have to find his own way to school & my fiance was on my side. G did not like this idea, and we all got into a big argument about it. It has caused a lot of tension in the house. There is a bus route that begins about 3 blocks away from our house and drops him off directly in front of his school. I don't want to leave him hanging, but I feel like this is a step that needs to be taken for him to gain some independence he will need to grow. We try to tell him that this is an opportunity for growth and that he. should be grateful that we are taking care of the cost. We are only giving him the responsibility to complete this task of getting his permit & he is not having it. So, AITA for telling him I will no longer be driving him around?", "created_utc": 1679329791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wnj5h/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_i_will_no_longer/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having such people on the road makes the roads more dangerous for *everyone*. \n\nI'm not going to give you a judgment, because it's really up to you to look inside yourself and figure out if you are really trying to come up with a pragmatic solution or if you have landed on this idea because you resent him for not wanting to learn to drive just yet (as implied by your decision to put \"not ready\" in scare quotes, characterize it as \"claiming\", and describe the impact on you as an \"insult\")", "NTA at all.

I get it.  I was so thankful when my son started driving so I didn\u2019t have to ferry him around anymore.  But he was ready and wanted his license.", "Yta.\n\nFirst off, there's a trend of teenagers and young adults not pursuing their license. It's not unique to your son it's just kind of the trend that's happening in society so that's completely normal. Are you a stepmother? To me that's the end of the story but it seems really odd that you decide to put your foot down and his last year of school. You can't just do this for one more year? It it sounds like he's a really motivated kid if he's on the cross and he's driving his bike across the town to go to school. He's also part of a divorce family and probably has a lot of stuff cuz of that. I wish my stepmom would just support me the best that she could rather than give me an ultimatum that's just going to make me hate her. That's just my two cents.", "YTA here, if he says he's not ready trust him. You might feel like he does great when driving short distances but he might not feel that way. What makes you think forcing him behind the wheel before he is ready is good for him? If he has an anxiety about driving he could be a danger to him and other motorists, is that something you've considered? Not wanting to drive him is one thing but don't force him to do something he isn't ready for. The bus is a good option.", "NTA. Pushing for him to drive if he has anxiety around driving is bad, but there is a bus 3 blocks away which isn't a far walk.", "No, NTA, but I hope you understand you're essentially giving him the choice between taking that bus route, and deciding he wants to live with his mother full-time. He appears to have taken driving off the table, let it go.", "NTA but I have to wonder if he has anxiety regarding driving or even an issue from a traimatic incident when he was younger. Most highschool age humans will JUMP at the chance to learn to drive and become more independent, which is why I think there MAY be more to his not wanting to drive than just \"not wanting to learn\" or \"not caring about becoming independent\". I could be wrong, it could just be he has no \"drive\" < yeah, that pun was groan worthy no doubt>.", "YTA, it sucks but today\u2019s teens aren\u2019t into driving.

Ever since I become of driving age, I learned and accepted that my phobia is MY problem. It's not everyone elses' job to work around me, or make sure that I get where I need to go.\n\nIt sounds like your stepson needs to start embracing that theory, and take steps towards becoming independent. If you're in the US, certain parts of the country are difficult/impossible to get around without a car/license. He's getting to the age where that becomes HIS problem, and should cease inconveniencing the entire family.\n\nI understand your frustration taking on the brunt of your stepson's travel burden, but your phrasing suggests that you don't take his concerns seriously.

If this is true the YTA. make his dad drive them or leave them at mom's during the week.", "It's a touchy subject. My Fiance tries to avoid conflict at all costs and he wants to spend time with his son, so we just work it out so he can be with us during the time we have him & avoid any potential arguments.", "I see where you're coming from. I suppose I used my quotations because I do believe he is just trying to push it off. Maybe I should look deeper. My concern is that he is more into being in his room, playing videogames and not willing to put the effort into learning, if he showed that he would put the effort into learning, and still felt that he wasn't ready that would be one thing, but he simply has just refuses to try.", "I completely agree with you and will not refrain from judgement: OP, YTA.", "I learned how to drive at 16 but I didn't get my full license until I was 22. And waiting was the right choice for me. (I probably could have managed it at 19 or 20, the extra two years was just how the logistics worked out.) Two decades later as an adult, it's easy for me to analyze the situation and explain that it was overwhelming because I was dealing with a combination of anxiety, slight difficulties with my driving skills, and family dysfunction. But as an inexperienced teenager, all I could do was shut down & resist retrying the drive test after I had flunked it. If my parents had forced the issue I think I would have A) definitely experienced a lot more stress and B) probably gotten into an accident within the first year.  \n\nI did take responsibility for my non-driving choice and used the bus system & rides with friends to get most of the places I wanted to go. So there's definitely room for OP to nudge stepson towards more self-reliance. And perhaps if you reframe basic driving as a skill that you want him to learn so he can handle emergency situations, whether or not he ever gets an actual license, he might be more open to starting the process. Asking 'How' he would prefer to learn might help too; perhaps doing it with a calm family friend would be a less stressful option than trying to pick a parent, or perhaps he'd prefer working with an online tutorial first. Good luck!", "Probably be fine", "yikes", "She\u2019s not forcing him. She\u2019s telling him to learn how to drive OR take the bus.

Absolutely not. In a household unit, you are a team. You work together. If something you\u2019re doing is causing unnecessary stress then fix it.

So i see i shouldn\u2019t force him to get his license, but we do need him to start taking initiative when it comes to his responsibilities & transportation.", "My fiance starts work very early, when he is available he does drive the kids. And you're right, with this post I am realizing I am not alone and that a lot of kids don't want to drive. I know it's not his fault whatsoever, but being in a dual household there are some things that would be helpful to both sets of parents that he could help with.", "I think you're missing the point, all of us parents - sorry I'm an \"almost parent\" thanks for reminding me - are on the same page. I talk to his ex-wife, and we all communicate, he wasn't abusive, they were just very young when they got together, got pregnant, and decided they weren't compatible. We're a team, that's why I am here for my fiance and my stepkids but i feel like at this point it is enabling and not so much \"helping\"", "Yes, it seems to always turn into an argument whether it's us, or his mom.

He isn\u2019t avoiding the problem, both my fianc\u00e9, G\u2019s mom & myself are on the same page with requesting that G takes action and take on more responsibility for getting himself where he needs to go.

Interesting.   \n\n\nDoes avoiding conflict mean that the child's mom won't have an opportunity to fill you in on the husband's issues?", "He is a full-time student, a student athlete with a demanding schedule, a child of divorce who is actively living in two households...all of which is on top of going through the normal teenage and high school pressures (which, by every measure, has been much more difficult over the past few years given the state of the world)\n\nIf you think he isn't putting effort in (especially after the exhausting few years we have all had), you aren't paying attention.\n\nI get it that you feel like you are only asking him to do one thing and he is \"refusing\" to do that one thing. But he is doing a lot, just to maintain where he is. If this task doesn't feel doable, there is a reason.\n\nSo again, it's perfectly reasonable to try to solve the pragmatic issue. But teenagers have limited coping mechanisms. Decompressing by playing video games is often an important coping mechanism...you shouldn't just assume that it is avoidance. And keep in mind that where adults might be able to articulately explain why they do not wish to participate in a particular activity, teenagers often just refuse without explaining...That doesn't mean there isn't a good reason, it just means they have more limited emotional intelligence and communication skills than adults do.", "It definitely sounds like an ultimatum to me.  Probably should have said that.  But if I were the kid I would feel like I was being forced which will lead to resentment.", "This is how a kid acts when they're hiding something.

There were a handful of women in my small group who had severe driving phobias. Many of their issues sound similar to your stepsons. \n\nHe had to so some critical development during a pandemic and I'd imagine that could have exacerbated many different types of anxiety about taking care of himself. He missed 2 years of practice. In that sense, the anxiety is valid. But it sounds like he could have a problem keeping the anxiety in check enough to avoid spiralling into catastrophizing. The way he shuts down and refuses to talk about it suggests he knows his reasoning isn't logical... which does seem to point to anxiety as the culprit. I vote NTA, but you guys need to get him in counseling with someone who he'll open up to.", "And how's the kids supposed to feel when the Stepmom tells him that she doesn't want to spend 20 minutes in the morning with him everyday? Supposed to just be happy and so proud that that's the Stepmom he got. She's only seeing it from her perspective. She's not seeing time as quality time because it's not her kid and she doesn't care.

I complained some due to eating crap foods for convenience at times, but it was my choice to have kids so I sucked it up.

Exactly! It's enabling and not so much helping.   \n\n\nI'm so glad to hear that you're not in one of those worst case scenarios where this kind of thing is a sign of abuse.   \n\n\nBut seriously, rule one of step parenting is step out of the role of enforcer. It's not your job.  \n\n\nStep parents can provide a wonderful new relationship for a child. But it's not a parent. It's not the person who decides that actually, you can drive and you're going to drive now.

It can really help.", "So it always seems to turn into an argument but you don't seem to have heard him tell you why he doesn't want to learn, even with the offers you all have made him if he does learn?

To me it seems like she doesn't see herself as a mother to her stepson and doesn't care about her relationship as much. I know I'm reading into this a lot but I'm going off with the information that I'm giving. I would take those mornings as a time that I get to spend with my stepson and I would enjoy those moments and enjoy the quality bonding time. She chose to be a mother she didn't have to be.
