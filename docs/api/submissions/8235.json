He lived with my ex while I saw him pretty much every weekend, every break and most of the summer.

As an example she is refusing to allow him to play HS football next year because summer conditioning interferes with her custody and she doesn\u2019t want to drive him.\n\nMy son recently started asking me a lot of questions related to his mom.  Like why he can\u2019t play football, why is his mom forcing him to wear glasses and not contacts (she didn\u2019t want to pay me half, which was 100 dollars per court order so she insisted on forcing him to wear glasses so she could argue at the hearing that she doesn\u2019t need to pay), why he can\u2019t get his passport (she is \u201cscared\u201d), why did his mom try to change his schools to a \u201cghetto\u201d school (she moved in with her boyfriend cuz she had a baby).\n\nI got tired of covering for his mom when she was making his and my life so difficult so I just started not hiding the truth for some things when he asks directly.  Sometimes I will say \u201cidk ask your mom\u201d.  But for bigger things, For example, telling him sorry about football and that I can\u2019t sign him up without permission from his mom. Or telling him his mom tried to switch his schools because it was closer to her boyfriends house.\n\nHe still is close to his mom but gets frustrated with how stubborn she is.  But my sister told me I\u2019m supposed to just not tell him anything because saying anything negative is considered parental alienation. Or give some rose colored response like \u201coh your mom has good reasons for xyz\u201d. So now I feel bad.

I think you are doing what's best.  You need to acknowledge your son's frustrations and be honest. Just make sure you keep it to the facts and avoid being critical.  It sounds like an awful situation, and I feel bad for your son.  It sounds like you are doing everything you can do to help him.  Can you possibly talk to your lawyer or see if it's possible to get any changes added in that would allow your son to do his extracurriculars?", "Parental alienation is the sort of thing your ex did - deliberately casting the other parent in a bad light (sometimes by interpreting the truth in the worst way possible, sometimes by outright lying).  It sounds like you aren\u2019t doing that, and the only thing you\u2019re doing is acknowledging when his mother is the reason why he can\u2019t do/have things that he wants.  That\u2019s reasonable, as long as you\u2019re careful not to shift into giving negative interpretations of her actions and refusals. Sounds like you\u2019re striking that balance, so NTA", "NTA \n\nThat isn't what parental alienation is and you're not doing it. You are telling the truth. A 14 year old deserves honesty.", "NTA thats not negative stuff your saying its the truth. If you are saying it in an objective tone and just answering his questions Without any of your opinions on the situation id say its pretty fair.", "NTA. I learned a long long time ago, don't cover for the ex. They can sink or swim on their own. I never made up stories on why the ex did not show up, or why the ex would drop my daughter off with his girlfriend, why he pursued something more interesting.\n\nI had e tell me no on many occasions and I just paid for things out of my own pocket. I would get your son contacts and other things that he needs, the heck with the ex. I refused to play that game with my ex.\n\nHe was the one that ended up looking like a don't care parent.", "I'm going to go with NTA, but it depends on how these conversations go. If, for example, when your son asks about not being allowed to play football you say \"your mom doesn't want to drive you to practice\", that would make you an ah. If you say \"your mom doesn't want to lose the time she has with you\", then n t a. You could also say \"your mom doesn't want you to but you'll have to ask her why\" and not be ta. Be truthful, but don't talk bad about his mom.", "No judgment here, but speak to a family law attorney (if you can use the same one you used for custody, great) about alienation. No one\u2019s N T A judgment here will help you in court if mom alleges parental alienation.", "NTA. But wipe the word \u201cghetto\u201d from your vocabulary, though, and ask your son to do the same.", "NTA, your sister is delusional here. Your ex is already going to have a rough time with her kid, why would you voluntarily do the same?", "NTA. Your kid is growing up and sees the hardships of having separated parents. It\u2019s unfortunate you both can\u2019t come to an agreement for the child and do what\u2019s best for him. You are being honest with your kid and giving honest reasons \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd", "NTA. He's getting old enough to know the truth, and I think you're handling it well. No emotions, no perspective from your view. Just facts.", "NTA.  The truth hurts when it shows the vindictive behaviors.", "Nta.  The truth shall set you free.  Shes already proved she'll lie about you, so your best bet is to speak the truth.  Dont freely offer criticism,  but if shes putting you in a difficult situation and its affecting your son, it's better he gets the truth from you than the lies from her.  Just make sure you can back up everything you say.  Not your fault if shes digging herself a hole.", "Nta. If I was your kid I\u2019d want the truth too. I\u2019d cut you off if you lied to me about something like that that affected me. Maybe he\u2019ll want to just move with you or fend for himself", "NTA. Whether you gave him reasons or not, he\u2019d come to conclusions on his own, which would probably hurt him more in the long run. I think what\u2019s important is trying to remain neutral as possible, not by withholding info but by being aware of your tone and word choice to not villainize your ex (as much as you\u2019d understandably want to lol). It sticks with kids when their parents talk down on the other. My parent who did so strongly regrets it as it made somethings harder for my siblings. Try to be emotionally supportive as possible. Your kid may want to express negative feelings towards his mom to you, and I think it\u2019s appropriate to acknowledge his feelings and let him know you care about him and his emotions.", "YTA. \nIt\u2019s best just not to say anything. You can correct things that are wrong, and \u201cdefend yourself\u201d but only as related to you. You don\u2019t want to start the back and forth of whom is worse than whom. Just because mom is petty, doesn\u2019t mean you have to be.", "YTA. don't badmouth the other parent even if she's doing it to you. He's not a jury, you don't make arguments to him. He's your son and can see what is going on for himself. Your son will figure out on his own who the real bad parent is and chances are, he'll realize it's the one doing the badmouthing. If both of you are, he'll realize you're both toxic and (hopefully) go NC with both of you. If you feel your ex is responsible for certain things, state what happened in a neutral way. \"You can't get contacts because your mother won't pay half and I won't pay more than half and I even paid a lawyer more than the cost of contacts to get a court order that said I won't pay a penny more than half\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I tried asking for reimbursement per the court order **she asked for** and was told no.  Fine, whatever, I already paid.  But then she went and tried to force our son to wear glasses anyway because we have a hearing in a month to finalize the child support order and she wants to make sure she doesn\u2019t have to reimburse me.  Nice try though.", "Well, I hope they can help out.  Sorry you are both in this situation.  It's got to be so frustrating as a parent to have your hands tied like that.", "So she wanted a court order for 50/50 in general, then you went ahead and bought your son a luxury item (contacts when he could wear glasses) and you want her to pay you back half for them when you never consulted with her about the purchase ahead-of-time? YTA - just because she wants to split things 50/50 in general doesn't mean you get to buy stuff and ask her to pay half when you didn't first run the purchase by her. Would you like it if she bought your son a car and then told you that you owed her half?
