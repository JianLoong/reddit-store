I\u2019m not upset about that. Please, take any time you can get with your child. But he didn\u2019t cancel our plans. He brought his daughter to our lunch date without letting me know. I was uncomfortable, but it was last minute, & as a parent I of course understood. We spent the day at the park, & then I went home.\n\nFew weeks later. I\u2019m expecting him on Saturday morning.

The good news is that if I watch his daughter, we can spend time together & get to know each other! I pull him to the side and I asked him if he really didn\u2019t have anybody else to watch her.

He said it\u2019s his daughter & I have to accept her. And at the end, he basically said that I should\u2019ve prepared myself to basically be a stepmom cuz I knew he came with a daughter.

I told him I felt like he\u2019s forcing his daughter on to me, & if what he\u2019s really after is a stepmom to his daughter, than maybe we should reconsider this relationship.\n\nHe has since apologized, but now I have it in the back of my head that he doesn\u2019t care to have a relationship with me at all, what he\u2019s really after is someone to watch his daughter.

You have very clear (and reasonable)  boundaries that he has now twice violated. And for him to be upset he couldn\u2019t stay the night on top of this? \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nHe\u2019s essentially told you all he\u2019s looking for is a stepmom. You deserve more than live in babysitter and fuck maid. You sound functional and like you\u2019re protecting your kiddos as well as yourself and your future and I think you should keep going on that path\n\nI\u2019d reconsider the relationship if I were you.", "NTA.  Your bf took advantage of you, plain and simple.  He's agreeing with your boundaries (no kids involved yet), then breaking them.  And the fact that he comes with a kid does not mean you have to babysit that kid when it's convenient for him.", "NTA and he is definitely shopping for a stepmother (read free built in baby sitter) not a partner", "NTA but you know he is just looking for a free babysitter, right? Bonus for him is that he also gets sex out of the deal. Unless you want to be used in this way indefinitely, the only choice is to end the relationship. \n\nYou can do better than some guy who clearly uses women and also cannot handle the responsibilities of parenting.", "NTA\n\nIt's absolutely reasonable to have your own boundaries on what you want and don't want from a relationship, what timeline you want to follow regarding when you children meet you new partner (and vice versa).\n\nThere's nothing wrong with your boundaries and it was cheeky enough to bring his child on a date without letting you know (even if it was just before hand).\n\nIt's beyond cheeky to turn up and expect you to babysit his child while he isn't there.\n\nIf he wants a partner who is happy to immediately take on the step mother role, that's his prerogative but he needs to be open and upfront about that.\n\nSounds like it's time to accept that the two of you are looking for very different things, or at least on very different timelines.", "NTA. You set a clear boundary, and he agreed to it. He then crossed that boundary the second it was inconvenient for him. \n\nThe fact that he \"didn't want to bother\" his relatives but he had no problem at all bothering you says a lot about what he thinks of you too. \n\nIt sounds like he then tried to guilt trip you into doing something you are clearly uncomfortable doing, and then started backpedaling when he realized you weren't going to back down about it.\n\nHe doesn't respect your boundaries. He doesn't respect your time. He's manipulative and has no problem exploiting *his kid* to try and get his way.\n\nIs this someone you really want to spend any more time with?", "NTA, but he is letting you know what he expects.  A nanny and housekeeper.  If you do not want that, RUN", "Let\u2019s swap the parties over. \n\nHow would HE react if you dropped one of your children off on him suddenly and asked him to babysit? \n\n\u201cSorry 10 is off at camp, but I have been called in to work. It\u2019s an emergency. Don\u2019t worry, it will give you a chance to bond! Do some sort of father/son activity together\u2026\u201d\n\nNow imagine how he would react\u2026\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Time for a new boyfriend.  He respects his ex and her parents more than you.  And blames you for having boundaries.  \n\nMe thinks he wants a new mommy for his toddler", "NTA.  His actions and reactions were inappropriate.  Listen to that voice in the back of your head.", "\u201cThe good news is that if I watch his daughter, we can spend time together & get to know each other! \u201c\n\nThis statement says it all considering he\u2019s completely ignoring the following boundary for OP:\n\n\u201cIm also not ready for us to meet each others kids.\u201d\n\nHe is clearly looking for a stepmom. NTA but I\u2019d proceed with caution if at all.  He is definitely not willing to take it slow as OP wants to.", "NTA. If you told him you wanted to keep the relationship/parent aspects of your lives separate, then he should've respected your boundary. Also odd that neither he nor his ex reach out to the in-laws for help. It's their grandchild after all and they have more of a familial responsibility to the child than you. I really hope things work out for you.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't uncommon for some divorced/widowed people to seek out new partners in hopes of having someone else to help with their responsibilities.  While you have no interest in being someone else's child minder, your BF has demonstrated that's part of what he wants in a partner.\n\nYou might be able to work through that.  But my bigger concern is that your BF had an opportunity to turn down the call-in (\"Sorry, but I have custody of my kid this weekend and am not available\") and he didn't do that.  And then rather than call to ask you to babysit (which you might more easily have refused), he just showed up at your door with his kid.  That's not okay, and demonstrates a lack of awareness about your boundaries.\n\nI think you're wise to be cautious.  Make it clear that you're just dating casually and no dates should include children unless, and until, you both decide you're moving things to a different level.  Explain that he needs to make other arrangements for emergency care for his kid and needs to cancel plans with you if he suddenly has to care for his kid instead.  \n\nThen, if he pulls something like dropping his kid at yours again, you have very good reason to say, \"It's obvious we don't want the same things in our relationship.  I wish you well.\"", "NTA - he clearly has no compunction to cross boundaries and to foist his choices onto you. Walk away, he\u2019s not it.", "NTA its a boundary you both initially discussed. He agreed it was a good idea to not get children involved just yet. However yes both of y'all knew the other had kids and if it got serious they would eventually be involved but this was not the way to do. He should've made sure instead you were on the same page and discussed it. Just showing up with his daughter without any notice is just pressuring you.", "NTA. You were very clear about your boundaries. When he dropped the kid on you twice in violation of those boundaries, you didn't make a scene but spoke to him about it later. You have behaved perfectly well. It is up to you to decide if his behavior is sufficient cause to end the relationship or if he is worth having your boundaries broken. Good luck to you.", "NTA and you are not wrong. I think your relationship has run its course, and it's time to move on. It's only been 6 months. You're not obligated to settle for anything less than you're comfortable with.", "NTA. You have been together for 6 months! Keep on protecting your kids until you are sure any relationship goes in the right direction. This one does not seems to though...", "NTA. I don't understand the comments of 'what did you think was going to happen when you date a guy with a kid.' Dating is what you make of it, and as long as both parties consent, you can have a relationship any way you want to slice it. OP was very clear in her communication. OP has never dropped her kids off for bf to watch, nor would I as a parent ever think to do that without long conversations previously. This isn't 'honey it's been six months, I want us to move closer towards a blended family, what do you think' conversation. This is showing up with daughter in-hand -- cause that way it's even harder for her to say 'no' than if he had called to ask!!\n\nOP, get out. I have no doubt you'll find other single dads out there who are very happy to respect your boundaries because they have the same ones. But this guy in no way respects your communication, boundaries, or feelings.", "NTA. He trampled straight over your boundaries. Bringing his kid on a date was bad, then dumping her on you to babysit was outrageous!", "From the very first, you've made your boundaries very clear; he accepted those boundaries...sort of (but not really).\n\nWhen he \"*brought his daughter to our lunch date without letting me know*\", he was just dipping his toe in the 'boundary-crossing' pool. You, being an understanding & reasonable person, allowed it. You gave him an inch --- Naturally, he tries to take 6 feet and shows up with \"*he has good news & bad news*\"... Again, he's crossed your boundary, and again you allowed it. \n\nHe's now trying to take a mile, and you're the bad person, for refusing to be his babysitter. You called him out about his behavior and suddenly *you're* the one who's selfish, unprepared...blah, blah, blah. \n\nYou've only been seeing this guy for **6 months**. You are *not* partners; you are *not* stepparents!\n\nThe voice in the back of your head is already screaming at you...**listen to it**! Those red flags are waving for reason. \n\nI think you already know it's time to put him in your review mirror and move on. Better men are out there.\n\nNTA", "NTA he doesn't care of your boundaries or what you want from a relationship. He wants someone to take care of her daugther. I bet that when he was with his ex-gf, she was the solely responsible of the child. And maybe that's why they went separate ways.", "NTA. He stomped on your boundaries \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 and pretty much dumped this on you,  when you started that wasn't what you were looking for. \nDoesn't sound like you guys are in the same page", "NTA. I\u2019d not have looked after her as he had another option. I also would\u2019ve ended it when he said you should\u2019ve been prepared to be a step-mum. You\u2019re a better woman than I am.", "Nta\n\nDude is definitely just looking for someone to look after his kid. The moment he moves in you can expect him to be out with friends a lot more.", "NTA. If you want a future with this man you need to be way more clear. Something made him think it was acceptable to drop his kid off without asking in advance. That wasn't cool. If he needs a woman to help with his kid, he should find someone else. You should hold firm on your boundaries.", "NTA and your are right. He is looking for a free babysitter and he also wants a bangmaid. You stated your boundaries and he walked all over them. He could have had his ex in-laws help, but that would show them he doesn\u2019t actually want to be a father to his daughter. He only wants to look like a dad but non of the work and I bet that was a part of why he\u2019s no longer with his baby momma.", "You have done nothing wrong.  He\u2019s pushing your boundaries for whatever reason.  NTA", "No one wants to be a baby sitter for a single mom/dad. NTA.", "NTA. He clearly sees you as a free babysitter. Why should he do the work to set boundaries with his ex or ask for favors from his ex in laws when he can dump the mess on you to clean up? That\u2019s what he means by Stepmom, you do all the heavy lifting while he skates along. \n\nIf you continue this relationship, he will expect you to babysit and will guilt trip you when you refuse.", "He\u2019s shopping for a stepmom. Yuck. NTA", "Run. This will not change. I'm speaking from experience, he will keep trying to get you to spend more and more time with her while he does less and less and guilts you into being stepmommy. You're dealing with dating as a parent very well, and he's going to throw a big wrench in it all. You are **not** the AH, he is.", "NTA\n\nYou are not the babysitter.\n\nThe whole idea that it was the mom\u2019s weekend, but she needed dad to take child?  Ok.  Then dad is called to work?  Seems like mom\u2019s parents are perfect to watch child.  After all, it is their daughter who was supposed to have child anyway.", "I had a coworker like this who only dated to get free babysitting. I have that feeling this guy is like that too. He's in the market for a stepmother not a partner. NTA", "NTA and please end this because the things we ignore at the start are the things we end up leaving for in the end anyway but after a whole lot of unnecessary pain", "NTA & time you opted out of this.", "NTA, I have two kids, both teenagers now. Since me and their Mum separated, I have dated several people. Not one of them has met my kids. I talk about them with whoever I am with and I have photos of them and it's obvious as they have bedrooms at mine. But I have never felt that we were at the right place to introduce them.\nThe only person I have dated that knows my kids was another mum from their school but her son and my kids knew nothing about that.", "NTA and honestly please break up with him, he clearly is dating you so you'll care for his daughter and he won't have to. Cut the losses right now.", "Nope, but you need to run far away from him. SERIOUSLY", "NTA and if you keep seeing him, this is what it\u2019ll be.", "NTA and sound like he doesn't respect your boundaries....he is looking for a stepmom and he is going to resent that you didn't jump at the chance to take care of his child. My current fiancee did not meet my first child until we were both ready..over 6 months. I took it very seriously because it's not fair to the child.", "NTA, \n, are just recovering from a divorce and have 2 children of your own to raise.  You do not need the added stress of having to raise his as well.  Are you a partner or a babysitter?", "NTA \n\nSix months is still a fairly new relationship. You were clear about taking things slow, and that at this point in time you didn\u2019t want either of yours or his  children involved. It\u2019s concerning that six months in he\u2019s not only ignoring your boundaries but gaslighting you into spending time with his child and presuming that you are eventually going to get married. Red flags right there!", "Girl RUN far away from this situation now! NTA", "NTA. Keep your boundaries.  Lose the BF.", "Definitely NTA but the bf is. It\u2019s time to let him go.", "He wants a bang-babysitter", "NTA What he did is so out of line. Showing up & just expecting you to babysit? Nope.", "I wonder how his ex would feel about him leaving their daughter with someone the mom doesn\u2019t know, let alone his new gf.", "NTA since you already made your boundaries pretty clear from the get go,\n\nI don't think it's fair to say that he doesn't care to have a relationship and only wants a stepmom though, he could very well want both. Those are not mutually exclusive things to want.\n\nThat said yes it does come as a package deal most of the time unless you guys are just fooling around, if things ever get more serious, obviously the kids will come into the equation. So if you're uncomfortable, this probably isn't the right relationship for you and you should look for a man without kids.", "NTA you made your boundaries clear and he didn\u2019t listen BUT I don\u2019t think he is T A either (except for the last minute babysitting). He is expecting a life partner and his daughter is part of the package.\nYour expectations do not align and your relationship has run its course.", "Since when is a 4 year old considered a toddler?", "Nah but at the same time if this is going to get serious you will become a blended family. You mays well start to get over being uncomfortable or date a man without children.", "On the one hand he's making a valid point. He comes as a packaged deal with a kid. However, so do you and you've made it clear how you want to proceed with dating, having kids and boundaries. He's pushing your boundaries and expecting you to say okay, to last minute childcare because you have kids. Not cool. You're not the AH and maybe you need to reconsider this relationship since he's looking for help with his kid under the guise of 'packaged deal'", "Esh. You are an ah. Don't date someone with kids if you don't want to care for them ever. \n\nHonestly,  you're already 6 months in.  How much time do you want him to invest in you before you decide if you want to fully be part of his life?\n\nHe shouldn't have pushed but seriously,  what are you doing with this guy?", "ESH, only because boundaries are unclear.\n\nHis expectations for the relationship are different from yours; he's looking for a long-term partnership package deal. He was out of line asking you to watch his kid when the kid has only just been introduced, and without notice.\n\nYou're understandably not presently into the package partnership, but upon understanding that he was, it's time to get on board or cut him loose.", "I\u2019m going with a gentle ESH. His part is quite clear-cut; he didn\u2019t respect your boundaries. \n\nOn your part, I\u2019m a little concerned about approaching the situation pretending that the kids don\u2019t exist. That\u2019s a HUGE elephant in the room. You haven\u2019t said anything about long-term plans, but if there are, then how you behave with each others\u2019 children is a big part of developing the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

On the rare occasion he needed a babysitter, we went to my grandparents or aunts house.\n\nNothing against blended families, I applaud people that can, but my dad was not capable of handling that, and my parents divorce was tumultuous so I think he was trying to maintain the calm dynamic that had finally been reached while still moving on with his life.", "NTA.\n\n> He called me selfish & that I as his partner needed to help him out.

Seriously reflect on what his behaviour means about his personality and how he views the dynamic of heterosexual relationships. He is viewing you as a mother - whose duty it is to make sacrifices for her man and family AKA misogynistic bullshit backwards ideology. So fuck that In my opinion.

Yes, we do a lot with my children. We live together. He will help with them if I need it, but we have set up boundaries we are both happy with.
