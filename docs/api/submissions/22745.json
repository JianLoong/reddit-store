You are supporting your friends business by raising awareness of it. It is not fair for her to expect you to buy something for which you have no need or desire and it's rather rude of her for expecting it.", "NTA, but your friend is for trying to force you to buy sh!t you don\u2019t need.", "NTA.

You can\u2019t expect everyone to buy from you what they don\u2019t want and can\u2019t use .. she\u2019s not gonna make it with this goofy mentality and trying to pressure dead broke struggling people to buy eyelashes .. also if that\u2019s Al she sells and does it\u2019s not gonna go far anyway", "NTA.

She's simply retailing the lashes she presumably gets wholesale, right? P!us, I suppose, some \"curation\" or style marketing.\n\nOr is there some home-based eyelash manufacturing industry involved?", "Your def NTA here but I can't help but be curious; is the marketplace for fake lashes really so large that someone can have business dedicated to just that? Like what makes her lashes different than ones already availible?", "NTA.  I hate people that start a business that mostly relies on friends and family buying their products or service to make a living.  That is not a business.  That charity/begging in disguise.", "NTA.  You won't wear the lashes so why would you buy them?  You are supporting her by helping her advertise.  It makes no sense for her to want you to buy something you'll never wear.  She's basically asking you to throw away $20.", "As someone that\u2019s got several friends suckered in to different mlms and whom no doubt individually wonder why I never buy anything off them (if they sold something they actually created themselves it would be a different story but nope to over priced branded makeup, overpriced \u201chealth products\u201d etc). Nta. You\u2019re doing more for her already by helping her with advertising and marketing.", "NTA. I have my own eyelashes already & I'm not buying any fake ones that I have no use for.

You are doing the best you can to support her business. That's enough.\n\nWith regards to jeans- go to a thrift store in an upscale area. You will find all kinds of jeans- nice ones- for just a few dollars. I haven't bought new jeans in years.", "She buys them wholesale and then sells them for double of what she paid for.", "NTA. I have zero expectation that my friends or family patronize my business. They are welcome to and I would appreciate it, but they are in no way obligated to.", "NTA. You are supporting her. You promote her line by sharing on social media and by passing out cards. That is support and it is a lot more than buying the lashes. Word of mouth can be invaluable to small businesses. Shes acting entitled to your money knowing your circumstances.", "NTA tell her you\u2019re supporting her in spirit.", "NTA ALL of the pressure for this stuff is intense. Like I am sorry I don't do that - \"you should support my business\" well YOU DO! you repost and hand out business cards.", "NTA- her response screams MLM behavior. You sure this isn\u2019t an MLM? There are a few with lashes.", "NTA", "You clearly are supporting her business by sharing social posts and handing out business cards. It's ridiculous for her to demand that you spend money on her niche product that (a) you don't want/need and (b) you can't afford.

Does she also expect her male friends to buy her fake eyelashes? \n\nWhat if I was a real estate agent? Could I get angry at my friends for renting and not being able to afford to buy a home and denying me that sweet sweet commission?", "Is it actual wholesale or an MLM?"]}
