Your MIL is shaming you, her son and especially her granddaughter for having a name she can certainly pronounce, but won\u2019t. \n\nYou need to continue to correct her with confidence and boldly state your daughter\u2019s in front of her. Never back down.", "NTA - OP it's called toxicity and if you and your partner are on the same page about limiting visits then just keep it just around just you two so she's not around others to where she can't use it around others and she's going to be misled because she's not going to understand it when she gets older what her name actually is.  MIL is not going to change and if you need to keep her involved in your daughter's life, then keep it in a controlled environment.", "Nta. MIL got to name her own children, she is the asshole for continuing to complain about not liking the name you chose and claiming it's hard to remember. This is her grandchild, she should have no problem remembering the baby's name.", "NTA you set a boundary and she refuses to abide by it. Your husband needs to have a talk with his mother about this.", "NTA\n\nit's all about intent here, if your daughter genuinely has a difficult to enunciate name and MIL was genuinely trying and failing to correctly pronounce it that's one thing - However, based off your explanation, MIL is intentionally REFUSING to call your daughter by her name simply because it isn't one she likes, and then taking it a step further by intentionally mis naming her to other people.  Class A narcissism. My guess is this is not the first time she has thrown an adult temper tantrum over not getting her way.", "INFO: what is the name?", "NTA. If your MIL calls your daughter by this nickname again, ask her \"Who's that? I do not know anyone with that name.\" Or you could call her by some name she doesnt like repeatedly.", "\u201cNow, MIL. We\u2019ve talked about this before, remember? Her name is *Samantha*, not Antha. Oh, husband, I\u2019m scared your mom is having (whispers) memory issues.\u201d And say this in a slightly condescending, sing-songy and fake concerned tone. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  She is being profoundly disrespectful toward you and your partner.", "NTA-the only way I think you can successfully respond is to IGNORE anyone who uses the nickname when it is said. This includes anyone who doesn\u2019t know the actual name. Act like you are confused.\n\nThis way, you can at least teach your daughter to not react to the nickname. It\u2019s going to be tough, but it will work. The next 12 months will be crucial. Anytime someone uses the nickname, simply keep talking about something else (pretending you didn\u2019t hear) or, if they are talking directly to you say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry? What was that word you said?\u201d  When they repeat, say, \u201cI apologize, I have no idea what that means\u2026\u201d \n\nThis way, you are gracious, kind, and you\u2019re making MIL look like the narcissist fool she is. \n\nIf you make it about 12 months, your daughter will fix it herself when she doesn\u2019t respond to MIL when the nickname is used. You\u2019ll need to make sure MIL doesn\u2019t see her very often-probably no more than once a month and just for a few hours-and take plenty of her favorite toys to distract her with (even new ones for her to explore)!", "NTA. Other people do not get to name your children, regardless of their relationship to them. I hope you find a way to enforce that onto your MIL because what she is doing is PETTY.", "NTA.

Stay strong on this- and if she continues this way, be prepared to go LC/NC.", "NTA, obviously..", "NTA. Sounds like your mil is punishing your daughter because she doesn\u2019t like her name. Asinine. BTW, my (ex) mother in law still can\u2019t remember her 21 *year* old granddaughter\u2019s name. Hopeless.", "NTA.  MIL doesn't get to rename your baby.", "NTA That your MIL calls your daughter by her name\u2019s diminutive isn\u2019t a problem.

Nope. I hate that nickname, and I correct people immediately and firmly. \u201cNo, I go by xxxx.\u201d Very occasionally people think that\u2019s rude of me, but in my mind, it\u2019s not nearly as rude as them re-naming me!", "NTA. And please give your mil a new nickname too! Example would be Margaret vs Ret. She will LOVE it \u2764\ufe0f\n\nActually give everyone a new nickname but only use them around MIL. My only other suggestion is to stop seeing MIL but new nicknames seem way more fun.", "NTA \n\nWhat???

I\u2019d sit her down with your partner and tell her that she needs to use your child\u2019s full name, and if she\u2019s not going to do that, she\u2019s not respecting you as parents. If she doesn\u2019t change, stay low contact or go no contact, whatever makes you happier. It\u2019s not an issue to correct people using the wrong name. I have a slightly unusual name and have to correct people fairly frequently.", "NTA it\u2019s your daughter, not your MIL\u2019s. She may not like her name but that\u2019s her name regardless and she has to accept that.", "NTA, she's an adult, and your daughter's name is not difficult to say unless your MIL has a speech impediment. I would be concerned about your daughter being confused about what her name is as she is still at such a young age. Also Ra isn't a nickname but just a few letters of the name or the Egyptian Sun God.", "NTA. You could name your daughter the same name as your MIL and she would still have a problem with that. The name is not the problem, she is.", "NTA. And you should go nuclear. When done in public you should correct her by telling the person the real name and apologize for your mother in law by saying she is having difficulty remembering names lately and you and your husband are really worried about her.  Do it while she\u2019s still standing there.  Hell, do it if you run into someone who uses the wrong name.  It\u2019ll be so embarassing for her.", "This is a hill on which I would die every goddamn day, like Tom Cruise in *Edge of Tomorrow*. You are NTA. This is a naked power play by your MIL. She didn\u2019t like your choice of name for your daughter, so she\u2019s going to socialize **her** choice of nickname. Unless you nip this in the bud, you\u2019ll be fighting this battle for as long as your MIL is alive.

I would now go a step further and let those people know that the nickname is inappropriate and should only address your child by their actual name. And limit mil contact even more.

Since LC isn't working, perhaps go NC until she can learn to pronounce your child's \"difficult\" name?  Her disrespect for you and your boundaries will only get worse if you don't put a stop to her behavior now.", "NTA. Who is a woman that your MIL absolutely loathes? There has to be someone: a politician, an actress, her MIL, her neighbor, whoever. Start addressing your mother in law by that woman's name and keep at it. Introduce her by that name.

Label gifts with that name.\n\nKeep at it until she relents on your daughter's name.", "NTA- Aurora is a beautiful name and simple/easy to remember and say. What the heck is her problem?  My own grandma can never remember my sons name but she tries. Always calls him Bricenet when his name js Bennet.

Andrew is Anthony. She has a very hard time with names the last 15 years but she\u2019s not doing it on purpose so we let it slide.", "NTA. MIL is way out of line. If you don't set a boundary here, with your child's actual name, what other boundaries is MIL going to stomp on?", "If she can't call your daughter by her name then forget her.

If you and your husband are on the same page then stand your ground and enforce this basic, yet civil requirement that she respect your daughter's name!\n\nThat or you call your MIL \"b!t\u00a2h\" and just say that is your nickname for her. :-D", "Nta don\u2019t let mil take her anywhere. Problem solved", "NTA.   Beat her at her own game.  Make a nickname for HER and from now on use ONLY that to when you talk to or about her, introduce her, mail her anything, sign holiday cards, etc. Also her next birthday gift should be something personalized with it.

Next time she does that in front of you say something like I don't know why she can't remember her name. It's actually....", "We all get nicknames from different people.
