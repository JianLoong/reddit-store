On the last day I actually only work 6 but they pay us for the full day on the day we fly home. \n\nI earn pretty good money and I like to enjoy my days off. My wife 32 on the other hand is a teacher. And for whatever reason she feels the need to stay busy. \n\nBefore we got married I had a cleaning lady and I had a meal prep service for the days I didn't just eat out. I would also take a mini vacation every other week off. For example I would fly home Thursday, see my parents on Friday, then go to Vegas until Tuesday then fly back to work Thursday. \n\nWhen we got married I tried to keep my cleaning service but I was convinced it was a waste since she would be home those two weeks and she would keep the house tidy. \n\nI agreed. But it didn't turn out that way. She would leave some chores for me. Which is fine. Before I started living on my own I had to do cleaning and cooking and laundry at my parents home.  \n\nBut it started being more and more. Then we had kids and now it's even more. \n\nMy wife chose to stay home with the kids. Which once again is fine. We can afford it and once both kids are in school next fall she is going back to work. \n\nThe problem is that my kids are tiny little terrorists. They can walk into a clean living room and walk out five minutes later leaving it a crime scene.  \n\nI would be coming home to a mess. No bueno. So I hired a service to clean. ALL THE TIME. Not just for when I'm home. And I got one of the meal delivery services for three meals a week while I'm gone and four when I'm in town. I cook the other two meals. And I do the dishes. Well I put the dishes in the machine and put them way afterwards. \n\nMy wife keeps saying that I should be doing all that work and that I'm kind of an asshole for throwing money at my chores instead of doing them myself. But she also looks less exhausted and is happier. I'm also happier not having to clean up after myself and the three of them. \n\nI still do all the yard work when I'm home, which is minor because my service does the mowing and stuff while I'm gone. \n\nSo am I the asshole for paying someone to do my chores instead of doing them myself.", "created_utc": 1690027553, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156idzp/aita_for_hiring_people_to_do_my_chores/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It makes life more pleasant for you both and for your children and it seems as though you've gone out of you way to make it work. You  have recognised the gaps and have put plans in place to fill them. The result should be that you all have a happier, less stressful life with more free time to spend on one another and the children.\n\nAnd yet, your wife thinks you should do more. \n\nMy guess is this is coming from a place where your wife, despite it being her decision, isn't always happy being stay at home mom. Perhaps she sees your extremely fair work schedule and well remunerated pay package and feels some resentment over it. Perhaps she feels it should 'hurt more' for you the way she feels it hurts her?\n\nWhatever the reason, it needs a full and frank, cards on the table discussion with her. This isn't about you paying for services, this is something far deeper than that IMO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. If I ever get married, and can afford it, I will be having a similar arrangement. I would rather enjoy my time off with my friends and family.", "NTA. Not only are you helping you and your wife have a little bit of ease in your married life, and I would recommend pointing out that she does seem a little bit happier, you're also helping other people stay employed and have a job. So maybe explain it to your wife in that way and she will be less annoyed by it", "NTA\n\nAs a SAHP, it should be your wife's responsibility to clean the house and make the meals, as well as caring for the kids.  If she can't/won't do that, then it's entirely reasonable to hire those services out if you're financially able to do so.\n\nIt sounds like your wife doesn't feel like you're contributing enough to the household labor, but that may be just her perception because you're gone so much.  There's a strong possibility that these issues will intensify once she returns to work.  Going to work and then going home to care for kids is exhausting.  I recommend that you increase the meal services when she goes back to work.", "What?  No.  Is your manager an AH for paying you to work instead of doing themselves?", "NTA - talk to your wife so you are on the same page. I would happily pay someone to do the chores I hate so I could enjoy the important things more if I could.", "NTA - you should point out to your ungrateful wife that she seems more happier and looks less stressed out with the help of these services and to be less critical and more appreciative.\nHow could you be doing all of the house chores when you work all of those hours to support your home?  When are you supposed to get a break?", "If you can afford to pay, and you get to be fed, be less stressed, and live in a cleaner, more organized home? By all means, keep doing what you are doing. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou're making life easier for all concerned.\n\nYou can afford it.\n\nThese services are available for a reason.", "NTA - I'm a housewife with no kids and I still have a gal that deep cleans my bathrooms, windows, and wash walls down when needed. We actually clean together when she comes...and I have a weekly gardener.\n\nSometimes it's easy to overlook things when you're home all day especially if shes chasing after little ones. I enjoy yard work much more than cleaning my toilets. My husband suggested it...it was weird at first but I appreciate the extra help now. The kiddos need to learn to pick up after themselves too...", "NTA, that kind of thing would make my day, sorry she doesn't appreciate it as much as I would.", "NTA - You are working 12 hour shifts for 14 days. at a time. Your body may eventually build up to it, but can still be exhausting. Your home is supposed to be your refuge, a place of solace. \n\nYou need to be spending quality time with your little terrors instead of cleaning on your limited down time. Nowhere in your thread does it say that the food, lawn, and cleaning services have impacted your family financially for the worse. \n\nFrom what I understood although your wife is a teacher and she\u2019s at home until the kids go to school in the fall. From the way I read this, she\u2019s essentially been on break since the kids were born. You\u2019re at work at least 50% of the month. \n\nEven she can\u2019t handle the house because of the kids.  Why is it your responsibility to play catch up when you\u2019re off. How does she think it\u2019s going to be easier when she goes back to work. \n\nI understand equal division of labor. But she\u2019s not doing her part and your paying someone to do both of your parts, but you\u2019re getting criticized for being lazy.  Maybe some of her criticism is because she\u2019s overwhelmed and feels guilty for not doing better. \n\nMaybe when she returns to work, she\u2019ll truly understand how considerate you\u2019ve been because it makes everyone\u2019s life easier.", "NTA, Outside looking in sounds like she wants you to come home and work too. Seeing as how she is a SAHM and it's a constant job. Id ask \"If you feel I'm throwing money away to other people. Would you like me to pay you instead for those services?\" But be prepared it'll probably open a can of worms.", "NTA. If you can afford this, you should be able to enjoy your days of instead of doing chores for the sake of chores.", "NTA\n\nGeezuz, your wife is an asshole.", "NTA. I\u2019m a firm believer that paying someone to do your chores IS doing your chores. You made sure they got done and helped the economy at the same time. Win-win. \n\nBut I\u2019m taking you at your word that you have enough money and her only reason for wanting you to do it yourself is some kind of moral/personal work ethic reason. If, however, she\u2019s trying to properly fund a college or retirement account and you\u2019d rather buy a ton of pre-made meals then send your kids to college or retire at 60, that\u2019s another story entirely.", "NTA \n\nIf you can afford it, why not \n\nI send my laundry out sometimes \n\nSometimes things just need to get done \n\nGet some marriage counseling maybe", "NTA. You\u2019re good! My SO always said we should hire a cleaner but would have had a bloody royal whinge when paying for it.", "14 days in a row.. 12 hour days... supporting your family... and yet she feels like you need to be cleaning and cooking!!!?? dude.", "NTA \n\nI think it's reasonable if you can afford it to hire a cleaning service to come clean for you. You work a lot of hours and being home with tiny terrorists (loved the quote so I'm using it lol) all day is really exhausting. I think your wife may just feel overwhelmed because of the kiddos and may feel like she's doing more than you at times. Obv this isn't true, but it's hard to view the world from anothers perspective when you're overwhelmed. It sounds like you're a very caring person, and you just want your wife to be less stressed with all of the extra stuff. \n\nSuggestion.. Get her a spa day or something so she can relax for a few hours and have a chance to rejuvenate. Being a full-time SAHM is having a job you can never leave or take a sick day from. If you do it while you're at home to care for the little ones it'll be even more relaxing for her since she'll know the kids are with someone she can trust. \n\nBest wishes!\n\nEdited for grammar/spelling", "Your wife is being an asshole.

But it didn't turn out that way. She would leave some chores for me.\n\nNot fine. You had your portion covered. She said, stop that, I'll do it and she didn't. You are working your ass off and bringing the money in. \n\n>But it started being more and more. >Then we had kids and now it's even more.\n\n>My wife chose to stay home with the kids.\n\nYou are physically not there! You can't do things when are not there. I wouldn't want to come home to a giant mess. She knew that from the beginning. Just keep the cleaners and the meal prep.

My armchair psychological intuition is that she is doing a little projecting, she feels that she should be able to do everything and feels down on herself that she can\u2019t and thinks that you also feel that way. You hiring someone to do those things, while perfectly reasonable and, I believe well intentioned, may feel to her like your putting it her face that she can\u2019t handle it. I think this could be going on unconsciously in her head, as in she is not even fully aware of it which is why I suggest talking with someone who is trained in helping people figure these things out. Of course I could be talking out of my ass.", "My take on these services is that they are cheaper than martial therapy or divorce. Why put stress on yourself and your relationship if you don\u2019t have to? I\u2019ve seen so many couples fight about chores and who feels like they are doing too much or not enough and refuse to hire help when they can afford it and it hurts their relationship.
