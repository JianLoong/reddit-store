My husband and I packed a few toys for the twins to occupy themselves with on the floor, while the rest of us adults chatted on the sofas. \n\nAnyway, Jenny was playing with a red truck, and Jack decided that was the toy he wanted. He snatched it from Jenny, she started bawling. Then she snatched it back off him, and Jack started screaming. Then Jack grabbed it back, she cried and took it back, etc. This went on for about five minutes, the twins repeatedly taking this toy off each other, and then crying in turn. After a few minutes, they both got bored, and stopped fighting over the truck and decided to go off hand in hand to torture a houseplant together. \n\nI admit, my husband and I were laughing at the exchange, as were my parents. It just looked like something out of a slapstick comedy, and they weren't exactly guillotining each other, just grabbing a toy. My husband and I didn't interfere with them - if you have twins of this age, you KNOW they spend about 80% of their time doing this exact thing with each other. \n\nMy sister Rita was very offended, however. She told me that I was making Jack grow into an entitled man who feels he could attack his sister - because I didn't tell him off for taking Jenny's toy. She said Jenny would grow up hating me, and grow up insecure because I was \"favouring\" her brother. Called us bad parents, said I was a toxic \"boy mom\".\n\n\nAgain, my twins are 8 months old. They can't even talk or walk, let alone discuss conflict resolution. Yes Jack was the one who \"started it\", but half the time it will be Jenny. At this age, it's impossible to keep track of who starts which argument, considering they argue over toys five times a day. I'm also not going to interfere unless one of them hurts or bullies the other - I don't think them pulling toys from each other is a sign of sociopathy.

You can raise them in two separate rooms with zero interaction with the other one, and they'll still somehow find a way to fight over something.\n\nIt's an occupational hazard of growing up with someone the same age as you, and they'll grow out of it in a few years time. It's actually a benefit of having twins: you get to watch as they learn to engage with another person their own age, and figure out co-existence much earlier than many other babies of the same age.\n\nYou're also not TA for laughing at them lmao, watching twin babies interact with each other is frankly one of the funniest forms of entertainment to exist.", "NTA and I'm guessing Rita doesn't have kids", ">decided to go off hand in hand to torture a houseplant together.\n\nThat's the real crime here /s\n\nNTA", "NTA - Assuming your sister doesn\u2019t have children (?)\u2026.although this is not brain science\u2026", "NTA.

This is natural and children do this regardless of whether they're twins or not.\n\nHowever, just because the twins are only 8 months old, it doesn't mean they can't be taught not to snatch what the other child is already playing with. When one child makes a grab for the toy, start saying, \"X is already playing with that. Try playing with this instead,\" and distract them with another toy.\n\nOnce they go to childcare/pre-school/whatever they're going to have to learn not to grab and learn to share, so there's no harm in beginning to teach that message already.", "NTA 8mo is too young to reasonably expect sharing toys.

My son is 2 and when he does something wrong we tell him not to do that again but if we actually discipline him he gets scared and cries and just want to be held. Because he's too young to understand that he did something wrong, for all he knows he was just chilling and Daddy came up to him and gave him a hard time for no reason. You seem like a great parent, don't let someone who isn't the parent of your child tell you what to do.

As you pointed out, they are 8 months. Telling either of them off, is pointless! Your sister clearly has no clue about their development level, nor how to raise kids alltogether.", "NTA. I don't have twins but I do have two girls. They're not too close in age, there's 3.5 years between them, and they're typical siblings. They bicker pointlessly. Sometimes well intervene if one of them is being unreasonable or has done something really wrong, but sometimes we'll leave them to hopefully work it out for themselves. Parents need to pick their battles or they'd never get anything else done, and that's exactly what you did.", "NTA. I'm also a fraternal twin and I was cracking up reading this because we have SO MANY pictures and videos of me and my brother doing the exact same thing. For our entire elementary school years we had a (secret so our mother wouldn't find out and yell at us) cold war over this one keychain shaped like a vinyl record we'd constantly be stealing from each other and hiding so no one ever actually got to use it. My mom wasn't strict about anything except her ABSOLUTELY NO PHYSICAL FIGHTING and ALWAYS RESPECT YOUR SIBLINGS rules and while we very dutifully followed those rules when it came to my older sister, we fully wailed on each other with pillows and threw stuff at each other when she wasn't watching all the time anyway to get out our frustrations. We shared a room until high school, and the \"this is my space/stuff, this is your space/stuff\" squabbles were endless. My brother has grown up to be the gentlest, most easygoing, respectful of women man you'll ever meet, and one of my best friends and favorite humans.\n\nThis behavior is going to happen if you put any two children of any age or gender together, they don't even have to be eight months old or twins.

First off, it\u2019s clear how she feels about men. Second, her assumption that your daughter will just sit there and take it and develop some sort of complex also implies she feels like women are the weaker sex and she needs more protection. \n\nHer opinion is very clearly sexist.", "I am a mom of 11 month old twin girls. And what you just described happens in our house frequently. One is playing with a toy and the other comes up and grabs it, even if we have two of the exact same toy. And they both do it.

I imagine if things escalated or they needed help you\u2019d get involved but since this is a typical exchange in your household you let them resolve it which they did! I actually think you\u2019re instilling early problem solving in your kids by not cementing that you need to serve as judge jury and executioner for each exchange but only when necessary.

Kids don't understand sharing at that age", "NTA letting your kids figure it out themselves from a young age is how you let them build conflict resolution skills.

And eventually they get distracted.", "NTA obviously, but it's never too early to explain being kind to your sibling to your kiddos. It's just like teaching a baby gentle touches with an animal. I wouldn't expect it to take any sort of effect immediately, but you're just laying the groundwork for more meaningful teaching later on. I only say that, because it would be incredibly jarring for a toddler for their parents to go from laughing at their antics, to scolding them with no learning in between those points. \n(Not to say that the antics of babies and toddlers can't be hilarious. I have two kids myself, and the number of times I have to stifle my laughter before correcting my kids is way too high lol) \nThat being said, this isn't some sort of feminist issue, your kids are literal babies, and your sister needs to calm down.", "My mum's brothers are triplets, and according to my gran, they spent the first three years of their lives trying to take each others diapers off because to them it was the height of comedy... so I'm starting to feel like I'm having a very easy ride with Jack and Jenny if all they're doing is fighting over trucks \ud83d\ude2d", "Thank you!

And yes, normally we do try our best when they argue - especially if they're getting persistent - by distracting one of them with another of the same toy, hence showing them that they can both play with something without losing their minds at the other one haha. We only do that if they're really going for it though, we've learned to tell the difference between them actually \"fighting\" versus when they squabble over something they're going to forget in a minute. \n\nThey actually do attend a form of daycare for a few hours each day, as I work. Amusingly, according to their carer, they play quite nicely with the other children, and always hang around together. Same when I take them out to softplay, etc: they'll be good as gold and crawl around like a pair of conjoined beetles, and then start their cagefighting matches the minute they get home. I don't know whether it's a good thing or not, but it IS funny to watch.", "Thank you! And exactly, yes! We do sometimes try and distract them if they're actively losing their mind at the other one, by showing them another toy or an activity (like those Nugget couches) they can do together. I simply cannot agree with \"punishing\" such young kids for squabbling because, as you put it so well, all it will do is scare them. \n\nWe also don't like using physical separation from each other as punishment. Sure, we'll sit them apart when dining out or something to AVOID fighting, but I don't want them growing up feeling that being physically removed from their playmate and loved one is a consequence of natural sibling arguments.", "I'm so glad you mentioned the mutual drowning because Jack and Jenny will spend every bathtime trying to push the other one over into the water and acting like the spanish armada throwing stuff at each other, but will also lose their minds and scream hysterically if we dare to bathe them separately. \n\nThey're both very close already, and it's lovely to see... I think fighting is perfectly normal - I don't want to separate them from their best friend just to avoid a five minute argument.", "Yeah, Rita is childree by choice - which is of course her decision and a very fair one - but I think she has a lot of ideas about conflict resolution in adolescents from her experience as a middle school teacher, but sometimes those ideas simply won't work on children who are too young to understand much.", "Yes, and the fact that they're so young that their gender has absolutely no bearing in play. They're both the same age, the same size, and have similarly mischievous personalities. Jack took a toy, Jenny asserted herself and took it back, and then they forgot about it. I simply don't see the need to interfere just because Jack is a boy, because me doing that would only teach Jenny (who has the capability to take her toy back, and happily did so) that I don't consider her strong enough to fight her own battles. \n\nPlus, they're only 8 months old and pathologising every argument they have into some big struggle for equality is ridiculous.", "This is such normal and developmentally appropriate behavior for your twins. Not stepping in and letting them tire of the toy is exactly what any parent should be doing. It sounds like your sister doesn\u2019t have children let alone baby twins.

It's totally normal for five year olds to go through the \"making terrible jokes because they don't understand what is and isn't funny and are trying to figure it out\" phase and \"repeating things a billion times\" phase, but it's SO MUCH WORSE when they have a friend who is at the exact same stage so they're being validated into thinking these jokes are hilarious.

Also, Velcro swaddles if you still swaddle them, way easier", "Ah. I\u2019ve got child free friends that are in education that are like this.

This would lead to tears. I would pull him out, calm him down and let him do what he wanted. \n\nThere was another set of siblings that have been adopted by their aunt. They are great kids but obviously have some trauma. The ten year old is very intelligent but liked to answer questions by oinking. \n\nThe other teacher and my teacher friends were all aghast that I let him do this.

They're 8mos old they will be fine.", "My immediate reaction here was, 'Rita clearly does not have actual kids'", "Even talking about babies with gender involved is kind of weird unless it literally involves their sex organs or for development.\n\nThey're basically angry potatoes half the time.", "I\u2019m childfree to.  \nIt is common knowledge that kids fight over toys. Even if they both have the exact same toy they still want the one their sibling has. If anything it help their development right? How the fuck did she come up with her assessment \ud83d\ude02 does she has a hidden toy trauma? What did you do op???", "But the childfree who judges the ones who have kids and calls them selfish and bad parents for every single thing. Child free person here and even I know that is normal kid behavior, they won\u2019t even remember that exchange when they get older.", "You can't \"punish\" 8 month olds. They are still developing the concept of action/reaction. Your sister should read a book on child development before she starts giving out advice.

Now when they get older, if they are still doing this and you allow it, then that\u2019s a problem. But that\u2019ll be a bridge you\u2019ll cross later.", "Mom of twins here, and you're NTA. Parenting twins feels like being a hockey referee sometimes, constantly breaking up fights and sending one or both kids to the penalty box. But what you're describing is baby behavior, and trying to correct an 8-month-old regarding sharing will get you exactly nowhere.\n\nIf it gets out of hand, I'd suggest removing the toy in question altogether, but it doesn't sound like it got to that point.", "Nta. Has your sister ever had kids? Doesnt sound like it", "NTA\n\nHonestly, they are 8 years old. They don't know better.

Your sister is a real goofball", "This kinda of behavior lasted all the way to grade school when my uncle was caught stealing my dad\u2019s pencils and paper in 2 nd grade when the teacher decided they need to be in different classes. Twins do this kinda thing all the time.", "I m not mother of twins but I have twin brother. I have to say that often my brother when we were kids tried to impose his way, like watching football instead of show I was already watching, or take toy that I ve got and he liked and to be honest since he was boy and of course he is stronger than I was/am he would get away with his way, unless my parents saw or heard about it.  There is event when I was 6/7 years old and we were staying at my grandparents and my brother pushed me for something and my grandma punished him (made him sit in corner without playing for some time) and I got angry at her. When my parents arrived my grandma told them of course what happened, and my father asked me why I m angry at grandma, and I told him \"i know he is jerk sometimes but he is my brother and nobody mess with my brother\". I m in my 40is now but this is still joke in my family . \n\nSo i agree  with you, your kids are too young to be \"punished\"/corrected now, siblings will have their fights even if they are not twins. And I m sure in couple years when they are old enough to understand you ll correct their behavior and teach them that they can't take other people's stuff without permission, even siblings stuff, but now they are just too young! NTA! And if your twins are anything like my brother and I were, you ll have a lot to deal with\ud83d\ude02 good news once we were out of teen age we became best friends and till this day we are, not just twins but best friends!

But your sister sure is projecting behaviours onto children who developmentally too young to understand the consequences of their actions and not yet intentional communicators. Until at least 24 months of age they do not understand causality or affect. You\u2019re doing the right thing but out and she actually has some degree in child psychology or developmental psychology she knows nothing keep doing what you\u2019re doing it sounds like you\u2019re doing a fantastic job so NTA", "NTA and your sister sounds like a delight.", "NTA. BB identical twin mom here. Totally normal behavior.", "As mom of twins now 29 ... I know kids fight, argue that can't be avoided. But how you handle it does impact their lives. Since about 80% of your child's brain develops by age three. It's during these years of infancy and toddlerhood that your child's brain begins to develop memory, language, thinking, and reasoning skills. By the time they are 4 years old, they are formed and set with behaviors that won't change very much throughout their life. What is cute at 8 months won't be cute in pre-K or school, won't be cute when they go to work, or get married. So, learning to respect his sister, any female, or another person is important even at 8 months old.", "This is obviously not something to worry about. At least not yet. I would just be aware, that sooner or later, you\u2019ll have to watch out in case the sibling rivalry kicks into overdrive. My daughters were 4 years apart, but at 4 and 8, would often play Barbies together. One day we told them it was time to clean up. My 4 year old starting yelling \u201cOw! Sister keeps hitting me!\u201d But her older sister kept insisting that it wasn\u2019t true. So I hid around the corner to peek at them to find out what was really going on. Sure enough, older sister was cleaning up, while younger sister was just sitting there, and eventually yelled out \u201cOw! She\u2019s doing it again!\u201d  She was obviously just trying to get her sister in trouble and get out of helping. She got in trouble, and never tried it again!", "So your sister wanted you to 'tell off' an 8 month old.  Seems like she has some serious misandry issues for some reason and is taking it out on you, your husband, and your little baby boy.  Tell her she needs to get some help and enjoy your little ones, they will grow up WAY too fast.

NTA anyway", "NTA, reasoning with babies is pointless. But unless you brought that houseplant with you, don't let them at it.", "As a mother of two 12 year olds I laughed literally out loud reading this. (The choir loves your sermon sir.)", "Idk why you\u2019re getting downvoted. (I mean, I actually do know because this is reddit.) Rita is already biased against an 8 month old boy and crying sexism.

Your sister has some interesting takes on this, and who knows whether she's projecting or has watched enough daytime movies to become a parenting expert. \n\n(**Disclaimer so I don't get roasted, the next paragraph is enitrely facetious**)\n\nSo to appease her: Sit down with your infant son and explain in a calm and rational way that it is not considerate to take a toy from his sister without her express, written consent. Tell him doing so is a sign that he trying to exert male dominance and that is not acceptable. Then make him give her a heartfelt apology in front of everyone, and make him stand in the corner for at least an hour.\n\nOr just chill, don't sweat the small stuff, and let the kids settle their own hash. Kids need to know how to handle their own little conflicts without their parents getting involved. Good for you and your husband. Being parents of twins, you really don't have time to get into every little incident of toy grabbies.", "Twin here.  First rule never get between twins they will turn on you.  Also your daughter is going to be one tough little girl and will be able to defend herself against her brother.  If anything she might be the boss of him.  All kidding aside, leave the gender out of it and let the twin dynamic work the way it needs to.  Your sister is too hung up on gender role rather than simply letting kids be kids.  Also sounds like your daughter held her own.", "Yeah, definitely NTA.\n\nMy sister is 2.5 years older than I am. When I was about 2, and my father was the adult supervising the two of us, my sister stole a doll that I was playing with. This was the 5th or 6th toy she'd stolen from me in a matter of about 30 minutes, and my father was waiting to calm his anger before addressing the problem. According to my father, I didn't shed a single tear. I grabbed a wooden toy block that was near me, walked over to my sister, smacked her upside the head with said block, then took back my doll. I walked back across the room, sat down, and played with my doll. My sister was screaming and crying. Father made sure there was no blood where I hit her, then went and sat back down. Sister never stole another toy from me, and there was no goose egg or anything on her head the next morning.\n\nSometimes, letting the kids figure shit out between them is the best way to go.", "You remind me of my dad. When he was three he was playing with some wooden blocks and his uncle who was also three, they\u2019re a week apart in age, came in and knocked down dad\u2019s tower.

Our favorite joke was the tuba toothpaste joke", "In this economy?!", "NTA for telling your sister off and telling her what should be common sense\n\nBut kinda TA for having your kids scream on the floor I doubt anyone wants to hear that", "NAH, I think your sister just misunderstands a bit about development stages in childhood and is assuming they have more complex understanding of conflict than they do at that age", "It's funny for a few years, but then when they get mobility and sneakyness it is tearing out hair time! My twin brother and I were appearently whirlwinds of destruction and mayhem. My mom or dad take their eyes off us for a lil while and we would have constructed rickety ass towels of crap just to reach shelves and stuff we shouldn't. And promptly throw it all on the ground...or eat it as in case of fluoride pills. Fun times of panicked driving to an emergency room to force charcoal mixture down 5 year olds throats!", "Yeah, patiently correcting every infant argument at 8 months old? Not happening. My toddler nieces are very close in age. By the day's 457th toy grab/argument about whose identical pink boots are whose/animal cracker theft, I have just enough voice and energy left to look up and make sure they're not biting."]}
