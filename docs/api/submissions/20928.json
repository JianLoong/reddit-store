I didn't want or need anything. That this wasn't a secret challenge to find something I would like. I genuinely did not want any gifts.\n\nOf course she gets me some gifts. And I hate them. She got me junk and a responsibility. Two things I don't want more of in my life.\n\nShe got me this crappy little plastic egg cooker thing. She knows I make hard boiled eggs in the pressure cooker, and I have expressed before that they come out perfect every time and that I love it. So I don't need some piece of junk as-seen-on-tv replacement. \n\nShe also got me a small cactus. Which I see as nothing more than a responsibility that I don't want. I know cacti are pretty low maintenance, but I just don't care for them, and I have nowhere to put it, and I have a cat who likes to rub on things and push them over. It was a mess waiting to happen, which causes anxiety in me. And the only place to put it was in this one window in my tiny apartment where the curtain always drawn, so it's not like I ever see the damn thing.\n\nSo I threw it all away. After a few months these things sitting unused and unenjoyed just being useless clutter and wastes of money.\n\nAnd now she's mad and has been very distant lately. She said that it was the thought that counted. But I told her that it didn't seem like any thought was put into these gifts.\n\nI realize I'm a hard person shop for, and that's why I expressly don't want anyone getting anything for me.

It is the thought that counts- your whole attitude about this is so cold. She tried to find rings that applied to your life- yes, she missed, but you don\u2019t even appreciate the time she spent thinking about you. Some people express their love with gifts- she wanted you to know she thought of you. With the cactus, you could have sat her down and told her you appreciated the gesture and explained the cat issue, and asked if she\u2019d keep it for you at her place, or if she\u2019d be okay if you passed it to a friend etc.\n\nI understand not having space for extra stuff- I truly do- but sometimes we show people we love them by treating them with grace and care and accepting that sometimes they miss the point. Throwing things away, classifying them as junk, and claiming she put no thought into them- that can be very hurtful if she thought she had found you something useful.", "YTA. You don't have to like the gifts, sure, but talking about it like that, and then outright throwing it away? Chill, dude. She just wanted to make you a bit happier. You could've later tell her gently, after accepting the gifts, that you appreciate it, but she really didn't have to. Or you could've help her out, send her a wishlist prior to your birthday.\n\nYou are not only a hard person to shop for, you generally seem like a hard person to be around.", "YTA. Do you even like your girlfriend? It's not even so much that you threw away the gifts, it's your attitude towards them.\n\n>She got me junk and a responsibility\n\n>She got me this crappy little plastic egg cooker thing.\n\n>useless clutter and wastes of money.\n\nI don't even know why you feel this level of dickery is necessary regarding items that your girlfriend spent her time and effort on. You don't have to like, use, or keep the gifts. But I hope to God you didn't speak like this around your girlfriend.", "These comments are wild. OP expressly stated they did not want gifts. Their gf ignores their wishes. Several months go by while OP has these gifts sitting around their apartment that they were very clear about not wanting in the first place, understandably decides to get rid of them, and somehow they\u2019re the AH? \n\nNTA. Don\u2019t get gifts for people who make it clear they do not want them.", "NTA. She ignored everything you said and what you really want. Frankly, I would have been insulted. She could still have gifted you something that wasn't useless stuff, a nice outing with an activity she knows you like for instance. Random junk gifts are just another way of saying that someone doesn't actually care about what you truly want. And I say that as a person who loves to give good gifts. These were bad though.", "YTA.\n \nKeep it up and you\u2019ll be miserable alone!", "NTA\n\nShe could have taken you out.  I'm all about what the person wants.  It was your birthday!", "NTA.  The y t a votes are ridiculous.\n\nYou told her flat out that you did not want gifts.  That doesn't mean \"get me stuff I don't want.\"\n\nShe got you two things you do not even remotely need, and are just clutter in a small apartment.  There was very little thought put into these gifts.  She didn't listen to you at all.\n\nYou kept these for months and they went unused.  Yeah you could have maybe donated them instead of tossing them, but that's a small detail here.", "Ok I may get flamed to oblivion for this but.... I say NTA.\n\nReason is, you set a simple, specific boundary with your GF: NO GIFTS, period f dot. And she promptly puts her big stompy boots on and does a hoedown all over your boundary. \n\nIf this was any OTHER boundary she stomped on, she would be in hot water here. If this was your GF complaining about YOU doing something like this, you would be the one getting obliterated.\n\nThe only issue I have is HOW you got rid of her unwanted gifts. It eats away my lil cheapskate packrat heart to throw anything away.  Next time maybe drop the junk off at a thrift store? Although with the price of gas that might not be feasible, I dunno. But NTA  for setting and maintaining this boundary.", "Honestly? NTA. You told her you don\u2019t want a gift, and she still got you one. Obviously this is an issue for you and your gf should know you well enough to know that when you say you don\u2019t want anything, you mean it. It seems she wants to make herself feel good about getting you something while ignoring the fact that it doesn\u2019t make you feel good. And what\u2019s the point of a gift if it makes the other person feel bad? A nice gesture is only nice if the receiver appreciates it. So NTA.", "NTA \u2014 you didn\u2019t want anything to begin with, she bought those because she wanted to feel better about herself", "Definitely NTA. Your gf is for ignoring your boundary of no gifts.", "Going against the grain here to say NTA.  He said no gifts.  She not only got him gifts, she got him stuff he has no use for and no interest in.  I don't think he should have thrown them out, he could have given them away, discretely.", "My dude once told me no gifts. He loves my gift ideas and things but one time for his bday he said \u201chey don\u2019t bother getting anything I\u2019m already getting exactly what I want\u201d which he said \u201ca hotel room, a fancy dinner one night, and my fav bottle of scotch\u201d which we were planning on stopping at a liq store for. So I just went ahead and got him the scotch because I knew that was something he was going to be drinking anyway. He loved it. We drank it all weekend. At one point we went to the 7/11 and bought shitty taquitos and washed it down with expensive scotch. We laugh and reminisce about it ALL the time. There was nothing left of the bottle by Sunday afternoon \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "if you get gifts you dont like then donate them so someone else can use it that is need.  problem solved.", "NTA, you told her how you felt and that you didn't want gifts. For everyone saying \"it's the thought that counts\" IF SHE WAS THINKING OF HIM AND HIS FEELINGS SHE WOULD RESPECT THAT HE DIDN'T WANT ANY GIFTS. My bf doesn't like gifts, and has told me not to bother. I often settle for a piece of his favorite candy or maybe flowers to put in the house during the time of celebration but make sure it's not positioned as a gift for birthday. Or offer to take him somewhere nice, or a fancy dinner. For people to buy you junk because they felt they HAD to get you something is wasteful for all parties.", "Hard one since I don't like getting gifts too, but I'm going to give you the couple therapy lesson I got when my relationship was a bit shaky, and I went to counseling.  love languages.  People express their love in different ways.  Some people will tell you (verbal expression) they love you, some will do things for you/acts of kindness, others express their love physically (kissing, hugging, holding hands, sex and more), and others will show love by gift giving.  She could most likely be expressing her care for you through gift giving, and you rejecting that to her is a rejection of her feelings.  You can not change this about a person.  If she is constantly giving little gifts to people, it most likely is the way she does it.  This is something she probably won't be able to change.  You can after realizing this let her know the things that would be good to gift....special foods (treats) or what not.  Take some time to make out of a list of some innocent things a person could gift you without it causing you issue.", "Yes YTA. She thought you'd like a new way to make your eggs that you talk about so much, and perhaps she thought the small cactus could be a talking piece for the both of you. You could've at least put the egg cooker in your cabinet and forgot about it, and a cactus is barely any work at all, so putting in a small amount of effort would at least show that you are grateful. You're a terrible partner, and certainly an awful friend as well. Do better.", "NTA.  It sounds like you were very clear that you didn't want gifts, and she did it anyway...  and got things you don't want/need.  That doesn't sound very thoughtful to me.  You're not obligated to keep them.  If she truly understood that you didn't want a gift, then why didn't she invest time/money in a non-material gift, like taking you to drinks and dinner or a movie of your choice?", "ESH.  You did to need to throw them away.  You could have asked her if she wanted them while explaining that a cactus and your cat are a dangerous combination and you do not want to risk vet bills and that you prefer the pressure cooker and do not have room for the egg cooker.  Then ask her if she wants them.  If she did not want them, donate or put outside with a free sign on it when she will not be coming by.  Throwing them away was wasteful and disrespectful.", "NTA. If gifts aren't your thing and she wants to \"gift\" you something tell her to donate to the homeless shelter, animal shelter etc.. This way you don't have clutter and she feels like she has thought of you. Just a suggestion.", "Slight YTA. Even if you aren't a traditional 'gifts person', you could've still given your girlfriend some kind of idea to go off of:\n\n\"Hey (GF's name), I really don't want anything for my birthday gifts wise, but I would love if you planned a nice dinner out for us to enjoy together.\" \n\nOr even something along those lines. That way she has some idea of something she can do for you that's not more accumulative junk.\n\nI say this as someone who has gotten some pretty ill thought through gifts, it's best not to toss them out or give them away for a little while.", "Depends, both have a point that can be argued and valid. \nPicky or not, people will be people, but that's the intention we should focus on, it's good you know what you want, that's the knowledge part, but wisdom is to know how to read your significant other, play the part. \n\nHonestly, if my SO gives me a gift, the focus will be on the fact she gave me a gift, not that I don't like it if that's the case.\n\nEven if I said no gift, I would I would still appreciate the thought and would keep it. But that's me.", "Wow, kind of heartless to just throw them away in the trash.  Could have at least donated them or something.  I'm pretty sure she won't be your gf for much longer, so one less responsibility to worry about.  Soft YTA only because you did tell her, it's on her if she didn't listen - but I'm sure she heard you loud and clear now. Good luck!", "I don't like gives either I tell my wife and kids don't get me anything for Xmas or birthdays.\nI will buy what I want and need.\nThere's this Jacket in the closet been there for 15 yrs\nNever cared for it!", "NTA. You told her not to buy gifts and she did anyway. I also do not appreciate gifts that go unused or require attention I have no desire to give. I wouldn\u2019t have thrown them away. That\u2019s just wasteful. Donation is a better way to go.", "NTA you literally stated \u201ci don\u2019t want gifts\u201d then she got you gifts you don\u2019t want or need.", "NTA. \n\nYou were specific that you didn't want anything. She bought something to make herself feel better, not you. \n\nThe y-t-a responses make no sense. There have been so many posts where the prevailing wisdom is to buy what the birthday person wants. Why is this any different?", "Nta, I have people like this in my life. Never listen to what I actually want and get me things I just store in  cupboard until I can give way.\n\nMaybe ask her to gift you an experience together, make a donation in your name, or to write you a very meaningful letter. Let her know you don't want tangible gifts while still allowing her to show love by giving.", "YTA. If you said no gifts, fine. But offer an alternative like her taking you out to a movie you want to see, or doing something else together that's special. I get the egg thing but throwing away the cactus?\nWhy not ask her to look after it for you.\nYour reaction smacked of pettiness and resentment. She wanted to do something to show you she cared for you, and you knid of trashed that too.", "YTA\n\nBut it\u2019s probably because you don\u2019t like her. Which is fine. Not everyone should stay in a relationship. That\u2019s why you date", "YTA not for throwing away the gifts, it\u2019s not great when people give you gifts that aren\u2019t tailored to your likes, but for the whole tone of your post and the distain you seem to have for your partner.", "ESH\n\nOP, people like you tend to also be the people for whom others can do no right and who simultaneously feel misunderstood and unappreciated.\n\nYour GF should have respected your \u201cno gifts\u201d wish, but I can\u2019t help but think that you didn\u2019t help her with ideas for how you would want to be celebrated.\n\nYou might not want to be celebrated at all, which might make this an overall compatibility issue. It\u2019s awkward and difficult not acknowledging or celebrating your significant other\u2019s birthday - especially if the other person wants to be acknowledged and celebrated and feels the pressure to reciprocate what they desire.", "YTA... I got gifts wrong for my husband initially and I have some earrings from my husband i will never wear. I have them on display in my jewelry box. \nsometimes you just need to appreciate the intention. At least give it some time befor the items get a new home.", "YTA. \n\nI get so much shit I don\u2019t want/need from relatives at Christmas. I\u2019m polite and say thank you and then post it on my neighborhood \u2018Buy Nothing\u2019 group for someone else to hopefully use & enjoy. \n\nAnd I\u2019m assuming this is the first birthday you\u2019ve had since you two started dating. Maybe she\u2019s used to people saying one thing but meaning another and wanted to get you something small just in case you weren\u2019t serious about the \u2018No gifts\u2019 thing. \n\nBut there was no need to throw something useful (and alive) away, and to be a jerk to her about it.", "I was about to vote no AH here, but the comments convinced me of a soft YTA. \n\nI am like you--hard to shop for and I hate clutter and crap gifts.  I truly hate it.  I too would have gotten rid of these items almost immediately.  You are not an AH for getting rid of them, but for the way you addressed the issue with your GF.  How can you say that no thought went into the gifts when one of them (egg cooker) related to something that you apparently love (eggs in the morning)?  It's fine to get rid of it, but maybe be more thoughtful about her feelings.  She obviously was trying to make you happy and had made a mental note of something you enjoy before buying the gift.", "YTA for overall attitude but why not regift them.  Much better than tossing them in the trash.", "YTA\n\nYou sound really ungrateful, and are failing to appreciate she wanted to have a nice gesture for you. It almost sounds like you are ready to hate anything that comes from her. \n\nLook, I am a minimalist too, and I hate junk, but you cannot go through life throwing away things that people give you with the best intentions. You could have donated the egg thing, or placed the cactus on top of a bookshelf where your cat can't reach. The cactus btw requires zero water, it is not a \"responsibility\" as you intend to call it as a pretext to hate it. \n\nYou should really look inwards and ask yourself if you want to be alone for the rest of your life..", "Slight YTA\n\nI don't think either of you are wildly at fault here. Consider that providing for her partner may be how your SO shows affection. I understand that you clearly expressed that you don't like gifts, but this may be one of the main ways she expresses herself in relationships. \n\nRelationships will always be a combination of work and compromise. No one out there is going to 100% seamlessly fit into your life with zero friction or inconvenience to you.\n\nI can relate to you in that I also hate celebrating birthdays and gifts, but this is a really small thing to compromise on for a person who is otherwise wonderful. \n\nTLDR: There are worse things than an SO who wants to express their affection for you, make a small compromise here and act appreciative in the future. \n\nBest of luck", "Yikes...you sound a little high maintenance and perhaps she just isn't the one for you.  You don't see the relevance in things bought for you as a gift and she shouldn't be involved with someone who doesn't see her thoughtfulness.  She just wanted to do something nice and the trash is the last place these gifts should go.  Just let the cactus die (she could water it for you) and just not use the egg thing.  That simple.  She deserves someone who appreciates her wanting to go out of the way to TRY to make someone happy, and you should find someone who listens a little better when you say NO GIFTS...and perhaps also listens to your wants and needs a little more.", "I'm going with NAH, bordering on you are ta.\n\nYou expressed your desires beforehand and she ignored them. She can't be shocked this was the outcome.\n\nHowever, I am a gift-giver. I would find it incredibly difficult to be with someone if I was unable to give them gifts.\n\nOH, and an edit because I want to know how you do your hard boiled eggs in the pressure cooker. I've been using one of those plastic cookers for years, and I'd love to get rid of it if I can do them in my pressure cooker.", "I thought you said \"I'm very prickly\", and I was going to say \"see, she knows you well and got you a thoughtful prickly gift!\"", "ESH and I hope she gets wise and dumps you. \n\nDo you really not know how to graciously accept gifts from people you supposedly care about, even if you aren\u2019t thrilled by the items? You describe them with such disgust. This post makes it seem like you are extremely selfish and controlling and hard to get along with, and I don\u2019t mean just in a relationship, I wouldn\u2019t even want to be your neighbor. \n\nBut on your girlfriend\u2019s end, a gift should be given without strings attached so if truly given from the heart with no expectations she shouldn\u2019t care what you do with them. \n\nHowever I suspect her feelings might have more to do with how you regard her overall and not just those gifts.", "Soft YTA.  I understand being hard to buy for and letting her know not to get you anything.  But comments like \"But I told her that it didn't seem like any thought was put into these gifts\" is pretty rude.  The way you're talking about what she got you and how you feel about it seems pretty crappy.  I have to wonder if you speak to her like this often.  My guess is you'll be single soon so you won't have to worry about her \"crappy and thoughtless\" gifts anymore.", "YTA bigtime. You said you didn't want gifts but she thought she would give you a couple of token gifts just to acknowledge your birthday and let you know she cares. Nothing big and expensive.\n\nThe egg thingie was thoughtful because you like eggs and she thought you might appreciate it. She gets points for effort, even though she was wrong. It would have been polite to try it once. Sometimes these cheap gadgets even work surprisingly well. \n\nAs to the cactus, it would have been easy for you to explain why you don't want a cactus or any other plant around your cat. You could then ask if she would like to keep it at her place for you or should you gift it to someone else.\n\nTo tell her that she didn't put any thought into these gifts was cruel and no doubt incorrect. You hurt her. The fact that she is still cool to you months later tells us that your general behaviour has not improved. \n\nYou aren't picky, you are an asshole. There is a difference. Picky people can still be kind and polite.", "YTA - my husband isn\u2019t big on gifts (specifically asks for nothing), I usually get him something small, and one thing I thought he would like but he doesn\u2019t like it that much. But guess what? It\u2019s sitting on his desk anyways because he loves me and knows I put a lot of thought into it (it\u2019s customized).

Clearly you don't have the emotional maturity to understand that your partner giving you gifts might be more about making her feel like a valued and respected partner. Gift-giving can be a person's love language. It might make your partner feel good to have given you things, even if they are small and unnecessary. You didn't have to use them or care for them, they could have gathered dust but at least you could have just accepted them and moved on to promote your partner'a happiness and sense of being in a loving relationship. If a cactus is too much responsibility, it seems that perhaps caring for another human, someone who is committed to sharing a life with you, is far too much responsibility for someone of your level of selfishness and immaturity.", "ESH.

But yeah, you're an extra jerk for tossing it all away and speaking so coldly.", "YTA could've let both gifts just sit around somewhere unnoticeable. If she had given you something that actually requires your attention at all I would slightly understand but both gifts are so minimal that throwing them out took more effort than simply ignoring them.

Giving you gifts was just as much for her as it is for you. \n\nIf you don't like gifts then it's best to ask for food, immaterial things, sentimental things, or practical things. Food: You like eggs? Ask her to get you a duck egg or some non chicken egg or he'll ask her to go get farm fresh eggs not from the grocery store! what's your favorite food or a type of food you love? You love cheese? Ask for a cheese ball or some fancy cheese. You love chocolate? Ask for a nice box of chocolates. Ask for bread from a bakery or homemade scones or to cook your favorite meal. Ask to be taken out for dinner at your favorite restaurant. Ask for a muffin basket or an edible arrangement! Lots of things you can ask for that are food related.\nImmaterial things: ask for her to plan a nice date. Get you tickets to something you're interested in like concerts or plays or comedy shows or a car show or a convention. Ask to go to a water park or laser tag or go on a day trip to the beach. \nSentimental things: ask for a nice framed picture of the 2 of you. Ask her to paint/draw you a picture even if she's the worst artist in the world. Ask for a poem, even if she can't write for shit. \nPractical things: maybe your pressure cooker is old so ask for a new one (you can ask for the same one if you want). Ask for a chore that keeps getting put off to be done. Ask for a new rug or boots or gardening gloves or knife set or whatever is something that ought to be replaced but it still works so you never do it.\n\nIt doesn't need to be a gift that you are over the moon excited for. Simply something that makes you go \"oh that's nice\" is enough. What's important is recognizing the love behind the gift, recognizing how lucky you are to have someone in your life who wants to spoil you, who wants to spend time thinking about you and what you like and wants to give that to you. That's what a gift is about. And if you ask for things specifically it can help lower the amount of \"useless junk\", but be aware some people don't like getting exactly what they were asked to get and might deviate because they want to put their flair on it, they do this to show their love.", "Yeesh YTA.

I didn't want or need anything. That this wasn't a secret challenge to find something I would like. I genuinely did not want any gifts.\n\nOf course she gets me some gifts. And I hate them. She got me junk and a responsibility. Two things I don't want more of in my life.\n\nShe got me this crappy little plastic egg cooker thing. She knows I make hard boiled eggs in the pressure cooker, and I have expressed before that they come out perfect every time and that I love it. So I don't need some piece of junk as-seen-on-tv replacement. \n\nShe also got me a small cactus. Which I see as nothing more than a responsibility that I don't want. I know cacti are pretty low maintenance, but I just don't care for them, and I have nowhere to put it, and I have a cat who likes to rub on things and push them over. It was a mess waiting to happen, which causes anxiety in me. And the only place to put it was in this one window in my tiny apartment where the curtain always drawn, so it's not like I ever see the damn thing.\n\nSo I threw it all away. After a few months these things sitting unused and unenjoyed just being useless clutter and wastes of money.\n\nAnd now she's mad and has been very distant lately. She said that it was the thought that counted. But I told her that it didn't seem like any thought was put into these gifts.\n\nI realize I'm a hard person shop for, and that's why I expressly don't want anyone getting anything for me. I am very picky.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You were very clear and consistent in saying you didn\u2019t want gifts. \n\nMaybe a suggestion is to make up an Amazon wish list (or something similar) so she can either give you money towards that expensive shelving unit you want to buy to make storage more organized and such or she can buy the item it\u2019s self ( like a shelf in the shower to hold your razor so it doesn\u2019t get rusty. )\n\nMy husband and I are both hard to shop for because we either just don\u2019t have anything we really want or because it\u2019s really expensive. (I want a new iPad that\u2019s $700 for my birthday so he\u2019s going to give me money towards that since that would take up his whole paycheque to buy me.) So we either share a wish list or we discuss money towards an item so we can give without building resentment. \n\nI hate receiving gifts that feel like there was almost no thought out into them. (My dad is famous for always buying me a kinder egg for Easter and Christmas and or always buying my sister and I the same thing at the same time.) so I get how you feel.

Why should you have to go out of your way to keep trash because she didn\u2019t respect your request?\n\nI mean if she -really- want to give you something why not take you out for a nice date at your favourite food joint? I took my husband out for ice cream at the fancy shop in town and told him to order anything he wanted. Spent $50 on treats for him and he was so happy.

He was cold and distant and took into account zero of her feelings. \u201cWell, Tiff, why would her feelings matter when he asked for nothing?\u201d Well, dear internet stranger, many people don\u2019t want to gift nothing for a birthday, especially a significant other. Beyond that, many people say they want nothing but it\u2019s more of a \u201cI don\u2019t want to burden you\u201d rather than a \u201cI really want nothing\u201d. I think women have a harder time accepting the whole \u201cI am thinking of nothing\u201d and the \u201cI don\u2019t want a gift\u201d because we aren\u2019t quite wired the same. Although it isn\u2019t the theme of the post, it\u2019s easier to make a connection with the first point of thinking of literally nothing. Many women (and men) can\u2019t do that, so they can\u2019t fathom a life where they have literally no thoughts. \n\nThat, however, isn\u2019t what made Op the asshole imo. It was how absolutely cold he was about the entire situation and the way he explained the gifts - I agree to a degree, maybe more than most, about pointless gifts. I, however, wouldn\u2019t look my girlfriend in the eye and say \u201coh, I tossed your gifts in the trash\u201d. Who does that? \u201cOh, it was a waste of *your* money so I threw it in the literal garbage\u201d. THAT is the problem. If it\u2019s such a waste of money, why throw it away? Maybe it\u2019s how I was raised, but I\u2019d never throw away a gift (unless it\u2019s food or something that\u2019s gone bad). It\u2019s incredibly rude. \n\nAlso, to note, he says he doesn\u2019t want a cactus because of additional responsibilities. I hope OP and his gf don\u2019t want kids and have had that discussion. I\u2019d wager if Op can\u2019t handle a plant, he wouldn\u2019t want a kid or pet either. That part doesn\u2019t make him TA, though.\n\nTLDR: what makes him an asshole is the fact that he coldly threw it away instead of giving it away or accepting it. If you\u2019re going to regift something, wait a few *years*, or at least a few months. The whole \u201che didn\u2019t want it but she got it anyway\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily make either of them an AH, but his distant and cold reaction does.", "Also, the correct \u201cgift\u201d for the gf to get in this situation is dinner at a nice restaurant or some kind of experience, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to come up with something", "I disagree, honestly.

Throwing them away along with the wording used here gives me the impression that there was anger in the disposal of these gifts.

It's like when people get jokey gifts, yes it was funny when I opened it for like 5 minutes but now I have to keep this junk in my (tiny) apartment until I feel like it's acceptable to throw away.

My husband is also like this where he doesn't like gifts so instead I do things for him like, hey, buy yourself a fun video game. I know you like hockey so let's go to a game together.

I mean it\u2019s like OP just doesn\u2019t have any softness to them. No willingness to show some understanding.

I do think OP could have just done something else with the gift instead of throwing it away but at the same time I do understand the frustration. At the end of the day, OP was given something even though they explicitly expressed they didn\u2019t want it, and again, as this is their gf and not some acquaintance, it\u2019s fair to assume she can tell when OP is being serious and when they\u2019re not. Some people are particular about their things and/or gifts and this isn\u2019t a moral failing or a bad thing, just because ppl aren\u2019t used to that. The whole situation could have been avoided if OP\u2019s gf had taken OP at their word..", "I do understand this side of things for sure, but I still feel like throwing away gifts is a really harsh thing to do since it's obvious she had put thought into the items, also plenty of people say they \"don't want anything\" yet actually would throw a huge fit if that wish was granted.", "Everyone I know - especially since Covid - has gone towards experiences/food gifting.\n\nIn my family, we stopped the gift-giving except for children, but we do organize group experiences (indigenous businesses that do lore weekends, camping trips, spa days - that one is really nice for my DIL and me - or berry picking excursions, etc) because we all realized how much unnecessary junk we all owned.\n\nHolidays and birthdays are focused on being together - lots of potlucks and bbqs. We all realized what was truly important, and \"stuff\" isn't any of that.\n\nHaving said that, though, I bought the kids a new refrigerator last Xmas, because theirs was on its last legs and I was worried that it would die right when they wouldn't be able to afford a new one.

But nothing permanent.", "Just because you\u2019d like a cactus, doesn\u2019t mean everyone else does or should.\n\nOP\u2019s gf buying him gifts he doesn\u2019t want or need after he expressly told her not to buy him anything is just as thoughtless as someone not buying you a cactus after you specifically asked for one.", "I can see both sides, I just still have to go with him being an AH. There were more careful ways to let her down. However, this is just looking at it from the outside - what really would determine a solid judgement would be: how long have they been together? Has this happened before? Do they live together? Etc. \n\nWhile I agree with the post itself, I just don\u2019t agree with how he handled it. It was pretty immature - yes, he told her that he didn\u2019t want anything so she got simple, cheap things that she thought he\u2019d like. Sure, she probably shouldn\u2019t have, but I don\u2019t blame her for wanting to get her partner something for his birthday. But, like I said, I can see both sides equally. What would really sway my opinion would depend on how long they\u2019ve been together. If they\u2019ve been together for 5 years and this is the first birthday, that\u2019d be odd, right? If they\u2019ve been together for 5 months, then no, it wouldn\u2019t be odd. Without that information, I\u2019m going based off of the tone and not much else. The reason for that is because, again, I was raised to accept any gift (unless racist, homophobic, etc) with a smile and a thanks. So, while I understand many weren\u2019t raised like that, I\u2019d be pretty taken aback if my partner of x months/years said the words he said to her because it\u2019s unfamiliar to me and I\u2019d find it extremely rude (as is the way I was raised to think, and I agree with my parents opinion on the matter).\n\nUltimately, I agree with both sides.", "Uh, in what way is it \"putting thought into it\" to get something someone else specifically told you not to?\n\nAnd how long is he obligated to hold on to this stuff just because it was a gift? He had it for months. It's not like he tossed it in front of her the moment she gave it to him.", "I don't know how well thought out they were tbh. \nIf OP hasn't expressed, he wants to try a new way of boiling eggs, but it is clear how he loves the way he does them now, then there isn't much thought in it. Neither is a cactus tbh. Unless OP is a huge plant lover, which doesn't seem to be the case. \nWell thought out would be something she knows OP likes, or it's related to something he likes. A t-shirt with a favourite band, or something like that. \nSounds more like, \"I don't know what to get him since he's stubborn and won't tell me anything, so I'll buy something and pray for the best,\" \n\nI agree, though OP could have re homed the stuff or something. We don't know how small a place OP lives in other than mentions it's a small place. Stuff you don't need can be annoying to move around all the time.\n\nOften, you can hear, though, if it's \"ohhhh. You don't have to get me anything\" vs.\"No. Don't get me anything. \nIts on them if they get angry for not getting anything if they wanted something.", "I\u2018m pretty similar in the aspect that I don\u2019t want unnecessary clutter in my life.\n\nThat\u2019s why I tell anyone who ask me what kind of gift I want \u201eFood\u201c\n\nI get delicious and sometimes expensive food products I would not have bought myself and my tiny apartment stays organized.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a lot more environment friendly than throwing gifts in the trash", "I hope that by 'next time' you mean 'other people'. I'm sure your girlfriend would rather eat that cactus than getting you anything ever again.", "But the gift should make OP happy, not her. \nOtherwise its not actually about him and it's selfishly to feel good about herself.", "How about planning a nice dinner out? I think that would be a great gift that takes into consideration his desire to not have any knick-knack type gifts", "Then you get an experience, not a material thing. Go to dinner, a concert, a movie, whatever - don't buy stuff that the recipient doesn't want and specifically asked not to receive. That's not thoughtful or sweet, it's doing what you want and expecting gratitude for not respecting someone's expressed wishes.", "She didn't listen to him. That is **not** thoughtful.", "Wanting to is fine. Rating your desire to over their express desire not to is wrong and inherently the opposite of thoughtful.", "So she learned to actually get OP what they want for their birthday instead of useless garbage that they're expected to hold onto forever? Good! She's making progress!", "That\u2019s probably because GF only thinks about herself. BF stated his wishes very clearly. She disregarded them because she thought she knew better.", "She obviously did.\n\nHe didn't really want a gift so she got him something small a cactus\n\na something appropriate to his obsession with the perfect egg, an egg cooker.\n\nShe didn't shower him with unwanted diamonds, she got him 2 little appropriate tokens.\n\nPlus grumpy pants OP sounds *exactly* like the kind of person to say \"No gifts\" and then complain \"My gf totally ignored my birthday, she's all take and no give. How hard should I kick this gold-sigger to the kerb?\" \n\nHe's coming across as unpleasable and self-obsessed with appalling social skills.", "So what thought was taken? A cactus, when it\u2019s common knowledge plants and animals don\u2019t mix usually, especially pointy ones that need sun, and OP only has one window? So there\u2019s barely any sun in his apartment? Or the egg cooker? When app Says he likes his eggs cooked a certain way, that doesn\u2019t mean \u201chere try this\u201d if his gf really cared, she would of listened to him, and not bought him anything. And you\u2019re \u201che\u2019d complain if he didn\u2019t get anything\u201d is you basing stuff on your OWN actions, not the post like we\u2019re supposed to be doing. If reading is hard for you, just say that.", "He didn't want a gift. No really. He didn't want one. And she got him something slightly related to what he likes.  \nAnd making up cruel narratives when OP comes across to me as a literal minded autistic person who doesn't like having to pretend for others sake and makes his boundaries clear just highlights how devoid of merit your point us."]}
