I didn't want or need anything. That this wasn't a secret challenge to find something I would like. I genuinely did not want any gifts.\n\nOf course she gets me some gifts. And I hate them. She got me junk and a responsibility. Two things I don't want more of in my life.\n\nShe got me this crappy little plastic egg cooker thing. She knows I make hard boiled eggs in the pressure cooker, and I have expressed before that they come out perfect every time and that I love it. So I don't need some piece of junk as-seen-on-tv replacement. \n\nShe also got me a small cactus. Which I see as nothing more than a responsibility that I don't want. I know cacti are pretty low maintenance, but I just don't care for them, and I have nowhere to put it, and I have a cat who likes to rub on things and push them over. It was a mess waiting to happen, which causes anxiety in me. And the only place to put it was in this one window in my tiny apartment where the curtain always drawn, so it's not like I ever see the damn thing.\n\nSo I threw it all away. After a few months these things sitting unused and unenjoyed just being useless clutter and wastes of money.\n\nAnd now she's mad and has been very distant lately. She said that it was the thought that counted. But I told her that it didn't seem like any thought was put into these gifts.\n\nI realize I'm a hard person shop for, and that's why I expressly don't want anyone getting anything for me.

It is the thought that counts- your whole attitude about this is so cold. She tried to find rings that applied to your life- yes, she missed, but you don\u2019t even appreciate the time she spent thinking about you. Some people express their love with gifts- she wanted you to know she thought of you. With the cactus, you could have sat her down and told her you appreciated the gesture and explained the cat issue, and asked if she\u2019d keep it for you at her place, or if she\u2019d be okay if you passed it to a friend etc.\n\nI understand not having space for extra stuff- I truly do- but sometimes we show people we love them by treating them with grace and care and accepting that sometimes they miss the point. Throwing things away, classifying them as junk, and claiming she put no thought into them- that can be very hurtful if she thought she had found you something useful.", "YTA. You don't have to like the gifts, sure, but talking about it like that, and then outright throwing it away? Chill, dude. She just wanted to make you a bit happier. You could've later tell her gently, after accepting the gifts, that you appreciate it, but she really didn't have to. Or you could've help her out, send her a wishlist prior to your birthday.\n\nYou are not only a hard person to shop for, you generally seem like a hard person to be around.", "YTA. Do you even like your girlfriend? It's not even so much that you threw away the gifts, it's your attitude towards them.\n\n>She got me junk and a responsibility\n\n>She got me this crappy little plastic egg cooker thing.\n\n>useless clutter and wastes of money.\n\nI don't even know why you feel this level of dickery is necessary regarding items that your girlfriend spent her time and effort on. You don't have to like, use, or keep the gifts. But I hope to God you didn't speak like this around your girlfriend.", "These comments are wild. OP expressly stated they did not want gifts. Their gf ignores their wishes. Several months go by while OP has these gifts sitting around their apartment that they were very clear about not wanting in the first place, understandably decides to get rid of them, and somehow they\u2019re the AH? \n\nNTA. Don\u2019t get gifts for people who make it clear they do not want them.", "NTA. She ignored everything you said and what you really want. Frankly, I would have been insulted. She could still have gifted you something that wasn't useless stuff, a nice outing with an activity she knows you like for instance. Random junk gifts are just another way of saying that someone doesn't actually care about what you truly want. And I say that as a person who loves to give good gifts. These were bad though.", "YTA.\n \nKeep it up and you\u2019ll be miserable alone!", "NTA\n\nShe could have taken you out.  I'm all about what the person wants.  It was your birthday!", "NTA.  The y t a votes are ridiculous.\n\nYou told her flat out that you did not want gifts.  That doesn't mean \"get me stuff I don't want.\"\n\nShe got you two things you do not even remotely need, and are just clutter in a small apartment.  There was very little thought put into these gifts.  She didn't listen to you at all.\n\nYou kept these for months and they went unused.  Yeah you could have maybe donated them instead of tossing them, but that's a small detail here.", "Ok I may get flamed to oblivion for this but.... I say NTA.\n\nReason is, you set a simple, specific boundary with your GF: NO GIFTS, period f dot. And she promptly puts her big stompy boots on and does a hoedown all over your boundary. \n\nIf this was any OTHER boundary she stomped on, she would be in hot water here. If this was your GF complaining about YOU doing something like this, you would be the one getting obliterated.\n\nThe only issue I have is HOW you got rid of her unwanted gifts. It eats away my lil cheapskate packrat heart to throw anything away.  Next time maybe drop the junk off at a thrift store? Although with the price of gas that might not be feasible, I dunno. But NTA  for setting and maintaining this boundary.", "Honestly? NTA. You told her you don\u2019t want a gift, and she still got you one. Obviously this is an issue for you and your gf should know you well enough to know that when you say you don\u2019t want anything, you mean it. It seems she wants to make herself feel good about getting you something while ignoring the fact that it doesn\u2019t make you feel good. And what\u2019s the point of a gift if it makes the other person feel bad? A nice gesture is only nice if the receiver appreciates it. So NTA.", "NTA \u2014 you didn\u2019t want anything to begin with, she bought those because she wanted to feel better about herself", "Definitely NTA. Your gf is for ignoring your boundary of no gifts.", "Going against the grain here to say NTA.  He said no gifts.  She not only got him gifts, she got him stuff he has no use for and no interest in.  I don't think he should have thrown them out, he could have given them away, discretely.", "My dude once told me no gifts. He loves my gift ideas and things but one time for his bday he said \u201chey don\u2019t bother getting anything I\u2019m already getting exactly what I want\u201d which he said \u201ca hotel room, a fancy dinner one night, and my fav bottle of scotch\u201d which we were planning on stopping at a liq store for. So I just went ahead and got him the scotch because I knew that was something he was going to be drinking anyway. He loved it. We drank it all weekend. At one point we went to the 7/11 and bought shitty taquitos and washed it down with expensive scotch. We laugh and reminisce about it ALL the time. There was nothing left of the bottle by Sunday afternoon \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "if you get gifts you dont like then donate them so someone else can use it that is need.  problem solved.", "NTA, you told her how you felt and that you didn't want gifts. For everyone saying \"it's the thought that counts\" IF SHE WAS THINKING OF HIM AND HIS FEELINGS SHE WOULD RESPECT THAT HE DIDN'T WANT ANY GIFTS. My bf doesn't like gifts, and has told me not to bother. I often settle for a piece of his favorite candy or maybe flowers to put in the house during the time of celebration but make sure it's not positioned as a gift for birthday. Or offer to take him somewhere nice, or a fancy dinner. For people to buy you junk because they felt they HAD to get you something is wasteful for all parties.", "Hard one since I don't like getting gifts too, but I'm going to give you the couple therapy lesson I got when my relationship was a bit shaky, and I went to counseling.  love languages.  People express their love in different ways.  Some people will tell you (verbal expression) they love you, some will do things for you/acts of kindness, others express their love physically (kissing, hugging, holding hands, sex and more), and others will show love by gift giving.  She could most likely be expressing her care for you through gift giving, and you rejecting that to her is a rejection of her feelings.  You can not change this about a person.  If she is constantly giving little gifts to people, it most likely is the way she does it.  This is something she probably won't be able to change.  You can after realizing this let her know the things that would be good to gift....special foods (treats) or what not.  Take some time to make out of a list of some innocent things a person could gift you without it causing you issue.", "Yes YTA. She thought you'd like a new way to make your eggs that you talk about so much, and perhaps she thought the small cactus could be a talking piece for the both of you. You could've at least put the egg cooker in your cabinet and forgot about it, and a cactus is barely any work at all, so putting in a small amount of effort would at least show that you are grateful. You're a terrible partner, and certainly an awful friend as well. Do better.", "NTA.  It sounds like you were very clear that you didn't want gifts, and she did it anyway...  and got things you don't want/need.  That doesn't sound very thoughtful to me.  You're not obligated to keep them.  If she truly understood that you didn't want a gift, then why didn't she invest time/money in a non-material gift, like taking you to drinks and dinner or a movie of your choice?", "ESH.  You did to need to throw them away.  You could have asked her if she wanted them while explaining that a cactus and your cat are a dangerous combination and you do not want to risk vet bills and that you prefer the pressure cooker and do not have room for the egg cooker.  Then ask her if she wants them.  If she did not want them, donate or put outside with a free sign on it when she will not be coming by.  Throwing them away was wasteful and disrespectful.", "NTA. If gifts aren't your thing and she wants to \"gift\" you something tell her to donate to the homeless shelter, animal shelter etc.. This way you don't have clutter and she feels like she has thought of you. Just a suggestion.", "Slight YTA. Even if you aren't a traditional 'gifts person', you could've still given your girlfriend some kind of idea to go off of:\n\n\"Hey (GF's name), I really don't want anything for my birthday gifts wise, but I would love if you planned a nice dinner out for us to enjoy together.\" \n\nOr even something along those lines. That way she has some idea of something she can do for you that's not more accumulative junk.\n\nI say this as someone who has gotten some pretty ill thought through gifts, it's best not to toss them out or give them away for a little while.", "Depends, both have a point that can be argued and valid. \nPicky or not, people will be people, but that's the intention we should focus on, it's good you know what you want, that's the knowledge part, but wisdom is to know how to read your significant other, play the part. \n\nHonestly, if my SO gives me a gift, the focus will be on the fact she gave me a gift, not that I don't like it if that's the case.\n\nEven if I said no gift, I would I would still appreciate the thought and would keep it. But that's me.", "Wow, kind of heartless to just throw them away in the trash.  Could have at least donated them or something.  I'm pretty sure she won't be your gf for much longer, so one less responsibility to worry about.  Soft YTA only because you did tell her, it's on her if she didn't listen - but I'm sure she heard you loud and clear now. Good luck!", "I don't like gives either I tell my wife and kids don't get me anything for Xmas or birthdays.\nI will buy what I want and need.\nThere's this Jacket in the closet been there for 15 yrs\nNever cared for it!", "NTA. You told her not to buy gifts and she did anyway. I also do not appreciate gifts that go unused or require attention I have no desire to give. I wouldn\u2019t have thrown them away. That\u2019s just wasteful. Donation is a better way to go.", "NTA you literally stated \u201ci don\u2019t want gifts\u201d then she got you gifts you don\u2019t want or need.", "NTA. \n\nYou were specific that you didn't want anything. She bought something to make herself feel better, not you. \n\nThe y-t-a responses make no sense. There have been so many posts where the prevailing wisdom is to buy what the birthday person wants. Why is this any different?", "Nta, I have people like this in my life. Never listen to what I actually want and get me things I just store in  cupboard until I can give way.\n\nMaybe ask her to gift you an experience together, make a donation in your name, or to write you a very meaningful letter. Let her know you don't want tangible gifts while still allowing her to show love by giving.", "YTA. If you said no gifts, fine. But offer an alternative like her taking you out to a movie you want to see, or doing something else together that's special. I get the egg thing but throwing away the cactus?\nWhy not ask her to look after it for you.\nYour reaction smacked of pettiness and resentment. She wanted to do something to show you she cared for you, and you knid of trashed that too.", "YTA\n\nBut it\u2019s probably because you don\u2019t like her. Which is fine. Not everyone should stay in a relationship. That\u2019s why you date", "YTA not for throwing away the gifts, it\u2019s not great when people give you gifts that aren\u2019t tailored to your likes, but for the whole tone of your post and the distain you seem to have for your partner.", "ESH\n\nOP, people like you tend to also be the people for whom others can do no right and who simultaneously feel misunderstood and unappreciated.\n\nYour GF should have respected your \u201cno gifts\u201d wish, but I can\u2019t help but think that you didn\u2019t help her with ideas for how you would want to be celebrated.\n\nYou might not want to be celebrated at all, which might make this an overall compatibility issue. It\u2019s awkward and difficult not acknowledging or celebrating your significant other\u2019s birthday - especially if the other person wants to be acknowledged and celebrated and feels the pressure to reciprocate what they desire.", "YTA... I got gifts wrong for my husband initially and I have some earrings from my husband i will never wear. I have them on display in my jewelry box. \nsometimes you just need to appreciate the intention. At least give it some time befor the items get a new home.", "YTA. \n\nI get so much shit I don\u2019t want/need from relatives at Christmas. I\u2019m polite and say thank you and then post it on my neighborhood \u2018Buy Nothing\u2019 group for someone else to hopefully use & enjoy. \n\nAnd I\u2019m assuming this is the first birthday you\u2019ve had since you two started dating. Maybe she\u2019s used to people saying one thing but meaning another and wanted to get you something small just in case you weren\u2019t serious about the \u2018No gifts\u2019 thing. \n\nBut there was no need to throw something useful (and alive) away, and to be a jerk to her about it.", "I was about to vote no AH here, but the comments convinced me of a soft YTA. \n\nI am like you--hard to shop for and I hate clutter and crap gifts.  I truly hate it.  I too would have gotten rid of these items almost immediately.  You are not an AH for getting rid of them, but for the way you addressed the issue with your GF.  How can you say that no thought went into the gifts when one of them (egg cooker) related to something that you apparently love (eggs in the morning)?  It's fine to get rid of it, but maybe be more thoughtful about her feelings.  She obviously was trying to make you happy and had made a mental note of something you enjoy before buying the gift.", "YTA for overall attitude but why not regift them.  Much better than tossing them in the trash.", "YTA\n\nYou sound really ungrateful, and are failing to appreciate she wanted to have a nice gesture for you. It almost sounds like you are ready to hate anything that comes from her. \n\nLook, I am a minimalist too, and I hate junk, but you cannot go through life throwing away things that people give you with the best intentions. You could have donated the egg thing, or placed the cactus on top of a bookshelf where your cat can't reach. The cactus btw requires zero water, it is not a \"responsibility\" as you intend to call it as a pretext to hate it. \n\nYou should really look inwards and ask yourself if you want to be alone for the rest of your life..", "Slight YTA\n\nI don't think either of you are wildly at fault here. Consider that providing for her partner may be how your SO shows affection. I understand that you clearly expressed that you don't like gifts, but this may be one of the main ways she expresses herself in relationships. \n\nRelationships will always be a combination of work and compromise. No one out there is going to 100% seamlessly fit into your life with zero friction or inconvenience to you.\n\nI can relate to you in that I also hate celebrating birthdays and gifts, but this is a really small thing to compromise on for a person who is otherwise wonderful. \n\nTLDR: There are worse things than an SO who wants to express their affection for you, make a small compromise here and act appreciative in the future. \n\nBest of luck", "Yikes...you sound a little high maintenance and perhaps she just isn't the one for you.  You don't see the relevance in things bought for you as a gift and she shouldn't be involved with someone who doesn't see her thoughtfulness.  She just wanted to do something nice and the trash is the last place these gifts should go.  Just let the cactus die (she could water it for you) and just not use the egg thing.  That simple.  She deserves someone who appreciates her wanting to go out of the way to TRY to make someone happy, and you should find someone who listens a little better when you say NO GIFTS...and perhaps also listens to your wants and needs a little more.", "I'm going with NAH, bordering on you are ta.\n\nYou expressed your desires beforehand and she ignored them. She can't be shocked this was the outcome.\n\nHowever, I am a gift-giver. I would find it incredibly difficult to be with someone if I was unable to give them gifts.\n\nOH, and an edit because I want to know how you do your hard boiled eggs in the pressure cooker. I've been using one of those plastic cookers for years, and I'd love to get rid of it if I can do them in my pressure cooker.", "I thought you said \"I'm very prickly\", and I was going to say \"see, she knows you well and got you a thoughtful prickly gift!\"", "ESH and I hope she gets wise and dumps you. \n\nDo you really not know how to graciously accept gifts from people you supposedly care about, even if you aren\u2019t thrilled by the items? You describe them with such disgust. This post makes it seem like you are extremely selfish and controlling and hard to get along with, and I don\u2019t mean just in a relationship, I wouldn\u2019t even want to be your neighbor. \n\nBut on your girlfriend\u2019s end, a gift should be given without strings attached so if truly given from the heart with no expectations she shouldn\u2019t care what you do with them. \n\nHowever I suspect her feelings might have more to do with how you regard her overall and not just those gifts.", "Soft YTA.  I understand being hard to buy for and letting her know not to get you anything.  But comments like \"But I told her that it didn't seem like any thought was put into these gifts\" is pretty rude.  The way you're talking about what she got you and how you feel about it seems pretty crappy.  I have to wonder if you speak to her like this often.  My guess is you'll be single soon so you won't have to worry about her \"crappy and thoughtless\" gifts anymore.", "YTA bigtime. You said you didn't want gifts but she thought she would give you a couple of token gifts just to acknowledge your birthday and let you know she cares. Nothing big and expensive.\n\nThe egg thingie was thoughtful because you like eggs and she thought you might appreciate it. She gets points for effort, even though she was wrong. It would have been polite to try it once. Sometimes these cheap gadgets even work surprisingly well. \n\nAs to the cactus, it would have been easy for you to explain why you don't want a cactus or any other plant around your cat. You could then ask if she would like to keep it at her place for you or should you gift it to someone else.\n\nTo tell her that she didn't put any thought into these gifts was cruel and no doubt incorrect. You hurt her. The fact that she is still cool to you months later tells us that your general behaviour has not improved. \n\nYou aren't picky, you are an asshole. There is a difference. Picky people can still be kind and polite.", "YTA - my husband isn\u2019t big on gifts (specifically asks for nothing), I usually get him something small, and one thing I thought he would like but he doesn\u2019t like it that much. But guess what? It\u2019s sitting on his desk anyways because he loves me and knows I put a lot of thought into it (it\u2019s customized).

Clearly you don't have the emotional maturity to understand that your partner giving you gifts might be more about making her feel like a valued and respected partner. Gift-giving can be a person's love language. It might make your partner feel good to have given you things, even if they are small and unnecessary. You didn't have to use them or care for them, they could have gathered dust but at least you could have just accepted them and moved on to promote your partner'a happiness and sense of being in a loving relationship. If a cactus is too much responsibility, it seems that perhaps caring for another human, someone who is committed to sharing a life with you, is far too much responsibility for someone of your level of selfishness and immaturity.", "ESH.

But yeah, you're an extra jerk for tossing it all away and speaking so coldly.", "YTA could've let both gifts just sit around somewhere unnoticeable. If she had given you something that actually requires your attention at all I would slightly understand but both gifts are so minimal that throwing them out took more effort than simply ignoring them.

Giving you gifts was just as much for her as it is for you. \n\nIf you don't like gifts then it's best to ask for food, immaterial things, sentimental things, or practical things. Food: You like eggs? Ask her to get you a duck egg or some non chicken egg or he'll ask her to go get farm fresh eggs not from the grocery store! what's your favorite food or a type of food you love? You love cheese? Ask for a cheese ball or some fancy cheese. You love chocolate? Ask for a nice box of chocolates. Ask for bread from a bakery or homemade scones or to cook your favorite meal. Ask to be taken out for dinner at your favorite restaurant. Ask for a muffin basket or an edible arrangement! Lots of things you can ask for that are food related.\nImmaterial things: ask for her to plan a nice date. Get you tickets to something you're interested in like concerts or plays or comedy shows or a car show or a convention. Ask to go to a water park or laser tag or go on a day trip to the beach. \nSentimental things: ask for a nice framed picture of the 2 of you. Ask her to paint/draw you a picture even if she's the worst artist in the world. Ask for a poem, even if she can't write for shit. \nPractical things: maybe your pressure cooker is old so ask for a new one (you can ask for the same one if you want). Ask for a chore that keeps getting put off to be done. Ask for a new rug or boots or gardening gloves or knife set or whatever is something that ought to be replaced but it still works so you never do it.\n\nIt doesn't need to be a gift that you are over the moon excited for. Simply something that makes you go \"oh that's nice\" is enough. What's important is recognizing the love behind the gift, recognizing how lucky you are to have someone in your life who wants to spoil you, who wants to spend time thinking about you and what you like and wants to give that to you. That's what a gift is about. And if you ask for things specifically it can help lower the amount of \"useless junk\", but be aware some people don't like getting exactly what they were asked to get and might deviate because they want to put their flair on it, they do this to show their love.", "Yeesh YTA.

I didn't want or need anything. That this wasn't a secret challenge to find something I would like. I genuinely did not want any gifts.\n\nOf course she gets me some gifts. And I hate them. She got me junk and a responsibility. Two things I don't want more of in my life.\n\nShe got me this crappy little plastic egg cooker thing. She knows I make hard boiled eggs in the pressure cooker, and I have expressed before that they come out perfect every time and that I love it. So I don't need some piece of junk as-seen-on-tv replacement. \n\nShe also got me a small cactus. Which I see as nothing more than a responsibility that I don't want. I know cacti are pretty low maintenance, but I just don't care for them, and I have nowhere to put it, and I have a cat who likes to rub on things and push them over. It was a mess waiting to happen, which causes anxiety in me. And the only place to put it was in this one window in my tiny apartment where the curtain always drawn, so it's not like I ever see the damn thing.\n\nSo I threw it all away. After a few months these things sitting unused and unenjoyed just being useless clutter and wastes of money.\n\nAnd now she's mad and has been very distant lately. She said that it was the thought that counted. But I told her that it didn't seem like any thought was put into these gifts.\n\nI realize I'm a hard person shop for, and that's why I expressly don't want anyone getting anything for me. I am very picky.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You were very clear and consistent in saying you didn\u2019t want gifts. \n\nMaybe a suggestion is to make up an Amazon wish list (or something similar) so she can either give you money towards that expensive shelving unit you want to buy to make storage more organized and such or she can buy the item it\u2019s self ( like a shelf in the shower to hold your razor so it doesn\u2019t get rusty. )\n\nMy husband and I are both hard to shop for because we either just don\u2019t have anything we really want or because it\u2019s really expensive. (I want a new iPad that\u2019s $700 for my birthday so he\u2019s going to give me money towards that since that would take up his whole paycheque to buy me.) So we either share a wish list or we discuss money towards an item so we can give without building resentment. \n\nI hate receiving gifts that feel like there was almost no thought out into them. (My dad is famous for always buying me a kinder egg for Easter and Christmas and or always buying my sister and I the same thing at the same time.) so I get how you feel.

Why should you have to go out of your way to keep trash because she didn\u2019t respect your request?\n\nI mean if she -really- want to give you something why not take you out for a nice date at your favourite food joint? I took my husband out for ice cream at the fancy shop in town and told him to order anything he wanted. Spent $50 on treats for him and he was so happy.

He was cold and distant and took into account zero of her feelings. \u201cWell, Tiff, why would her feelings matter when he asked for nothing?\u201d Well, dear internet stranger, many people don\u2019t want to gift nothing for a birthday, especially a significant other. Beyond that, many people say they want nothing but it\u2019s more of a \u201cI don\u2019t want to burden you\u201d rather than a \u201cI really want nothing\u201d. I think women have a harder time accepting the whole \u201cI am thinking of nothing\u201d and the \u201cI don\u2019t want a gift\u201d because we aren\u2019t quite wired the same. Although it isn\u2019t the theme of the post, it\u2019s easier to make a connection with the first point of thinking of literally nothing. Many women (and men) can\u2019t do that, so they can\u2019t fathom a life where they have literally no thoughts. \n\nThat, however, isn\u2019t what made Op the asshole imo. It was how absolutely cold he was about the entire situation and the way he explained the gifts - I agree to a degree, maybe more than most, about pointless gifts. I, however, wouldn\u2019t look my girlfriend in the eye and say \u201coh, I tossed your gifts in the trash\u201d. Who does that? \u201cOh, it was a waste of *your* money so I threw it in the literal garbage\u201d. THAT is the problem. If it\u2019s such a waste of money, why throw it away? Maybe it\u2019s how I was raised, but I\u2019d never throw away a gift (unless it\u2019s food or something that\u2019s gone bad). It\u2019s incredibly rude. \n\nAlso, to note, he says he doesn\u2019t want a cactus because of additional responsibilities. I hope OP and his gf don\u2019t want kids and have had that discussion. I\u2019d wager if Op can\u2019t handle a plant, he wouldn\u2019t want a kid or pet either. That part doesn\u2019t make him TA, though.\n\nTLDR: what makes him an asshole is the fact that he coldly threw it away instead of giving it away or accepting it. If you\u2019re going to regift something, wait a few *years*, or at least a few months. The whole \u201che didn\u2019t want it but she got it anyway\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily make either of them an AH, but his distant and cold reaction does.", "Also, the correct \u201cgift\u201d for the gf to get in this situation is dinner at a nice restaurant or some kind of experience, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to come up with something", "I disagree, honestly.

I personally love little trinkets, but I usually buy them for myself as little souvenirs or get them from family who went on vacation to a place that I'll probably never go to myself due to medical complications, and they know that I like them. Even if I didn't, I would still be grateful that they thought of me when it wasn't necessary.   \n\n\nThat's kinda how I feel about my own birthday, I usually tell my family that I'd just prefer for them to give me money if they insist on giving me anything for my birthday. If they really insist on giving me something that isn't money, then I go think of something that I want to buy myself but haven't had the money for or have been putting off for whatever reason.

The plant part does make more sense, but yea no, I completely missed that. I read the first part and the last part but somehow missed the cat part. I also did read the part where he said he likes his eggs boiled in a specific way and didn't want/need the other thing she got for him, but again, I just couldn't fathom throwing a gift away. The cactus for sure - say \"Sorry, I don't have a safe place for the cactus. Perhaps we can keep it at your place? \\[or insert friend that can take on said cactus\\].\"\n\nTo me, what sealed it was just the way he said it. Granted, neither gifts were that special or great, but I'd still need more information (time frame of their relationship, for example) to fully swing one way or the other. Like I said, I see both sides equally. I can see her side as I was raised in a household where gifts were pretty much accepted with a smile. I remember one year, I was maybe 7? and my aunt, who is poorer, put some toy cars in a cereal box. I remember looking at the box and wanting to cry because I thought she got me cereal for my birthday, but I just smiled, said thank you, and went for a hug. Of course, they laughed and told me to open it, but still. That level of respect was instilled pretty deeply. Also why I say \"Thank you\" to my server about 100 times before I finish ordering my food. So, to me, I certainly couldn't imagine just saying \"yea, I didn't like your gifts.\" to my SO. If this is the first birthday together, it's also even more awkward because she doesn't know your quirks. My mom says \"I don't want anything\" but, really, she does - she just doesn't want \\*me\\* to spend money on her to do it. A lot of people are like that, and for some, when you grow up around that type of environment, it shifts into your relationships too. OP genuinely didn't want anything, but the gf may not have known that. You can sit here and say \"well, that's what he said, isn't it?\" but, I mean c'mon, how many times have you bought a gift for someone that said they \"really didn't want anything\"? Perhaps none and I just grew up in a weird household, but that was pretty normal for me. So, yea, I still think it's rude to just toss gifts out (except the cactus I can see as it's a health concern). I can also see his side, however, that the gifts were useless. I don't like spending my money on useless things either. If someone else does, then fine, I'll use it - but, I won't ask for it nor will I spend my money on it. I'm very frugal with what I spend so I can see his perspective there just as easily as hers. If I'm thirsty at a store, I won't buy a bottled drink. $2 for a single cold soda? I can buy a 6-pack warm one for $3-5. Because I'm not there to buy soda, nor am I grocery shopping, I just skip the drink altogether.

That\u2019s a problem.

He could have had her keep the cactus and given the egg cooker to a friend. \n\nThat would have possibly fixed things, made her understand, and improved the relationship.

However the friend and their family clearly told my parent no, they did not want any visitors at this time.

Lord knows he\u2019s gotten me some useless junk and I know I\u2019ve gotten him some as well.

Then never mention it again. I think my fianc\u00e9 finally realized plants aren\u2019t a good idea for me after the last few (that I truly tried to keep alive) died.

Just because something is coming from a place of love doesn't mean that it's automatically good or necessary or useful or even wanted.

I think it\u2019s pretty common sense to avoid giving something known for being dangerous when handled to someone with a pet known for rubbing against things and biting plants.", "Maybe it can be the new family heirloom", "I'm Commander Shepard and I do not want any gifts.", "and ignoring somebody's expressed wishes is not the way you behave with someone you love.", "I love how the crazies on this sub just resort to \u201cLEAVE HIM SIS\u201d every fucking time", "Or just having more stuff/junk their life. Idk what it is about everyone in the comments thinking amassing more items is universally enjoyable.", "\"He must be a bitter lonely incel!!!\"\n\n\\-This sub", "That's still part of the whole actually being thoughtful about gifting thing that she seemed to have missed imo.", "This sub is 90% teenage girls and bitter divorced American women. Not really a surprise.", "Experiences are gifts, meals are gifts. He specifically said he doesn't want stuff. What she should have said is \"OK, I get you don't want stuff but is there a way we can celebrate your birthday together?\"", "> Well, dear internet stranger, many people don\u2019t want to gift nothing for a birthday, especially a significant other.\n\nSo what?", "While I agree his attitude is grating, shouldn\u2019t this be ESH, then? Because giving him gifts he doesn\u2019t like, after he explicitly said so, is just burdening him for no reason other than allowing her to feel better. She did something he asked her not to do, and then it\u2019s on him to deal with that. Why?\n\nIf she absolutely wanted to do something for him on his birthday, why not invite him out for a nice dinner, or cook for him?", "The stuff was there for a couple of months (as per OPs post). \n\nAlso, if someone explicitly states not to want presents and you really want to give them something, buy them a nice birthday card and create a fun way of adding some money. That way, the receiver can find himself something which will be used. I will be doing that for my nieces, since they haven't said what they want for their birthday.", "I got a succulent from our housekeeper for Christmas one year (it\u2019s the standard gift she gave all the clients) and I had the exact same reaction as OP when I found it.\n\nShe gifted me responsibility! And anyone who knows me knows I am not the kind of person who would be good at owning a succulent. There was nowhere in my apartment that had sunlight, warmth and free airflow and it died in less than three months.", "I think they\u2019re chosen by the amount of comments .. like I think there\u2019s a bot counting how many Y / T / A and how many NTAs are in the comments - afaik N / A / H will be counted as being the asshole for example, because of that - at least that\u2019s what I read somewhere", "She can appreciate his birthday without giving him stuff he never asked for. He clearly said he doesn\u2019t want gifts of any kind, how is her getting him anything thinking of him and his wishes?", "This is me. I don\u2019t know how to let stuff go because I am afraid of hurting the gifter\u2019s feelings. I think I had a panic attack when I was young about throwing away a foot it that didn\u2019t even work anymore because my dad gave it to me and my mom wanted to get me a new one (they\u2019re divorced). I am getting better, but I wish I had OP\u2019s more relaxed attitude even though he was a bit harsh. I get it though, must suck to explicitly state what you (do not) want, and then be ignored.", "I honestly think that's pretty immature. Why do i as an adult have to decipher what you genuinely mean and what has a weird underlying meaning. Can't we Just be honest with each other?", "For many people giving gifts is part of showing love. I get that she didn\u2019t listen, but it would probably go against everything she\u2019s ever done to not get gifts. As I said Ina post above, I think there\u2019s an easy way out that no one seems to think about. Why not want or gift an experience? Like going to a restaurant, a beer in a pub if it\u2019s a mate, or a hiking trip in the French alps - which is something no one will ever forget.", "Exactly this. His tone is sooo dickish. I've gotten gifts and missed the mark and received gifts that totally missed the mark. But I'd never show anything but appreciation and show some frickin diplomacy and tact.", "Why does the desire of the person who wants to give a gift overrule the desire of the person who doesn't want the gift?", "So you would do what she should have done in the first place and actually fucking listened to him?", "Good. Great. Thank you. Finally exactly what he asked for.", "Yep. Or a gift card to a place he shops a lot (I know a lot of people see gift cards as more impersonal but in this situation I think it would be a good way to show that she understands he doesn't like random gifts, but also knows him because she knows where he shops).", "Nah, it's forcing your will on them when they've been explicit about it.\n\nI've had to have the same conversation about surprises. \"But everyone likes surprises!\" I don't know! How many times do I need to repeat myself. Then surprised Pikachu's face when he gets annoyed. \nIt's really not hard to listen to what your SO likes or doesn't like. That's what's thoughtful", "How were the gifts thoughtful? An egg cooker thing when he's told her he has the perfect method for cooking eggs, and a cacti when the guy has no interest in plants? Doesn't seem like a lot of thought went into them.", "Bro she was trying to be nice and thoughtful, maybe she messed up but her intentions were good. OPs intentions calling her stuff trash she throwing it out we\u2019re not good. Op sounds insufferable I don\u2019t know how so many ppl backing op up.", "she didn't listen. That is the only relevant part.", "Maybe you can donate the toys? That way they are at least going to get used and enjoyed before ending up in a landfill!", "Because this sub saw that a man didn't 100% support what his gf did and went nuts", "I know right, I feel mortified when I think about where all the stuff I\u2019ve ever owned is. Like think of those favourite toys you remember as a kid and where they probably are now. Every person just has this growing mountain legacy of landfill in their shadow (granted some bigger than others).", "That\u2019s what I did but I don\u2019t know if little knick knacks are actually useful to the charities. It feels like wishcycling. I have a feeling they just throw them out.", "She got gifts to make *herself* feel better.\n\nIt's sadly very common that people buy gifts because they enjoy giving them - partly because people often lie about being pleased about them.", "I dunno, it has seemed to me like a LOT of cis men don't like women at all, and I've never heard one admit it.", "This is where I am. I have too many things. Little, cute things everywhere that I do like, but I can't do it anymore. I feel like I'm running out of surface space.\n\nI also love to read, and I love physical books over having Kindle/e-books. I literally have stacks of books because I need more shelves or bookcases.\n\nI find it very difficult to purge my things because most stuff I have has been given to me as gifts, and I know that the people gave these things to me out of love. It's so hard for me to \"Marie Kondo\" my life.\n\nI love the idea of asking for experiences instead, if people insist on getting me a gift. I need to do that.", "Yeah my egg cooker is the best lol makes perfect eggs every time", "If you love someone, you don't do the exact opposite of what they asked for your birthday also.", "I think the other thing here is (possibly) the social gymnastics of gift giving in certain sociocultural contexts. Like it's very common where I'm from to say \"I don't need anything, you don't need to get me a gift\" where the subtext is \"this is awkward because it would be impolite for me to outright tell you what I want and I don't want to seem entitled\". It's generally understood by both parties that you'll still be getting a gift, even though the opposite was technically what was communicated. I can image this is one of those bizarre social nuances that certain people (for example neurodiverse people) can understandably become confused by.\n\nEdited to add: OP does come across as pretty cold in how they handled the situation, I just wanted to provide a possible alternative read. Based on the info available though I'd say YTA. If OP was genuinely stumped at getting these gifts when they said they didn't want anything, it would have been more understandable to just tell GF that up front than throw them out later. Also the tone of the post indicates a lack of any kind of consideration for their GF or her feelings. Also, RIP catus."]}
