I\u2019m hoping this is just a rough patch between you and your mom and as both of you mature and get older hopefully your relationship will approve.

She rejected you and denied her legal obligations just because of your sexuality, and it's a hypocritical issue because she engaged in adultery and is unrepentant in the act.\n\n> She said she still hates LGBT people but is now willing to make an exception just for me.\n\nOh, damn, wow...ohhhh the charity.

Now, she comes back to lean into her status as your mother, one she has non-verbally rejected I might add again, so that she can ask you to gift her son whom you don't know from a hole in the ground your own possessions, because **now** you're a family again, **now** you're useful, **now** she has need of you.\n\nMy thought is, \"did you go far enough?\" It sounds like you were waaaay too kind to a woman who has done basically nothing **but** pop you out and browbeat you for that singular act. Even if she had done more the fact remains that disowning a child is like wiping any debt they may have to you clean, which she did, and she is now trying to walk back.\n\nYou should have told her to her face she owes too much in back child support to ask for anything free from you, and to screw off.\n\nNTA", " NTA- I\u2019m sorry that your mother is like this.

Your mom doesn\u2019t have a relationship with you. \n\nI\u2019ve also always loved books. My librarians knew me by sight. I had my library card number memorized. My parents let me have the master bedroom in one house because the big closet in there had shelves instead of clothing space and it was perfect for how many books I owned. Giving them away or \u201clending\u201d to someone I have no relationship is not something I\u2019d do either.
