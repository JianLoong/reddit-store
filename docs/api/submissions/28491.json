Even if she had done more the fact remains that disowning a child is like wiping any debt they may have to you clean, which she did, and she is now trying to walk back.\n\nYou should have told her to her face she owes too much in back child support to ask for anything free from you, and to screw off.\n\nNTA", " NTA- I\u2019m sorry that your mother is like this.

Giving them away or \u201clending\u201d to someone I have no relationship is not something I\u2019d do either.
