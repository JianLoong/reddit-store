You\u2019re entitled to your time off and this is the managers problem to fix. You do however need to seriously rethink about the types of things you say. Stating her pregnancy should\u2019ve been considered when hiring her is advocating for discrimination in the workplace. That\u2019s an attitude you need to drop both if you\u2019re ever wanting to be in a position of authority at a job and if you\u2019re ever speaking on the topic in the workplace. As a manger, you\u2019d be breaking the law to do that. As a team member making a statement like that in the workplace you\u2019d be contributing to a hostile environment against a protected class. As a general human being, it\u2019s an overall gross thing to say.", "OP, I know it\u2019s frustrating that you needed to cover for your coworker but it\u2019s worthwhile to remember that pregnancy days have a lot of entropy and she might genuinely be sick. \n\nI think your frustration isn\u2019t from her not coming in. It\u2019s from your manager expecting you to fill in rather that find an alternative work person during her pregnancy. That\u2019s totally valid and you should talk to him about it and mention that you are prepared to work your shift but do not want to be called in continuously on your days off.", "By saying that your manager should've considered the possibility of her needing time off due to her pregnancy, you are kinda saying he shouldn't have hired her. For that part you are kinda T A.\n\nHowever, your manager should've trained additional people on how to close. That's the issue, and you have every right to say no. Just, in future, leave it at \"no, I'm not able to come in\". Don't tell why, it leaves an opening for them to pressure you. NTA", "This. The idea that the pregnant coworker should be blamed in any way sits poorly. Pregnancy is a medical condition. Management should be training others to close or stepping in themselves.", "I think OP shouldn't have come in, but I also think he's TA for the line \"I'm not saying he shouldn't have hired [pregnant coworker] BUT...\" because, well, he clearly does think that and it's pretty gross.", "I feel like OP is young and doesn't understand that you can't discriminate but rightly says the manager should've planned better.", "Yeah it\u2019s not even the pregnant girl\u2019s fault that the manager is being a dick. It\u2019s ultimately management\u2019s responsibility to make sure the place is staffed, even if it means they have to cover the shift themselves\u2026which they never want to do.", "I assume OP is young and doesn't get it. Manager can't discriminate due to pregnancy but needs to think about staffing overall and 2 closers isn't enough.", "Not really cause the pregnancy is directly effecting him.\n\nYes it's a medical condition\n\nYes she should take the time she needs\n\nNo it isn't his job to cover for her it's on the hiring manager.", "It\u2019s also illegal in many places", "True.\n\nThe question becomes are these pregnancy related this scheduled or not?\n\nIf it's an appointment then they should be scheduled\n\nIf it is random can't finish X cause I am pregnant then idk", "I... said that? OP shouldn't have gone in, the manager needs to train more people to close. That doesn't mean that saying \"I think discriminating against pregnant folk is OK\" isn't an asshole move.", "The pregnancy stuff is irrelevant. The manager is responsible for scheduling and if an employee calls out, he needs to be training other people to close or cover the shift himself. Not OP or the pregnant employee\u2019s fault that the manager failed to do that.", "Weird that was supposed to be two up.", "I mostly agree.\n\nMy issue lies with the laws around holding a job for pregnancy.\n\nYes manager should train more people to close.\n\nThat said is the pay rate higher for closers?  In my expirence typically yes.\n\nManager has several choices here hire new closer and fire them when pregnancy worker is back full time.\n\nGet OP to come in\n\nCover it themselves.\n\nIdk about hiring managers you know but OP is the go too of most of them.", "Yeah but the question here isn\u2019t if the pregnant girl is TA for calling out. The question is whether OP is the AH for not going in on their day off. I\u2019d say no because it\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to cover for someone unless they already agreed to do so. Literally the manager\u2019s job is to figure that out.", "And calling op in might be their best course of action.\n\nOp doesn't have to go in\n\nBut let's not pretend managers have a tons of options here either."]}
