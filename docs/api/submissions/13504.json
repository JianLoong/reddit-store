Unless I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t ask others to do it, much less on their day off.", "NTA. Consider that you haven't even gotten to her maternity leave yet, let alone the many times for the next few years when she'll have to call in or leave without notice because her child gets a bug, etc.  The whole team needs to learn the skills necessary to cover for her.  It's unfair for her coverage, including short-notice OT, not to be spread out amongst a reasonable number of people considering you're soon not going to be dealing with just a few weeks a year of vacation/sick time regarding her.  This is now going to be a long haul which won't be ending for the forseeable future.  Morale and good business would dictate everyone be trained up so that there's not burnout and/or a critical situation.\n\nHowever, there's NTA, and then there's the world you have to live in.  Chances are, you're no longer considered a team player, as unfair as it is, because your boss' main concern (keeping the business open and running as usual) is the bottom line for him.  If you get let go because of it, it's going to be very hard to prove it, because it won't be the reason given.  Any businessperson with a decent lawyer on retention knows how to let someone go in a way that won't get them sued.  Even if you could fight it, would you really want to?  Brush up on your resume, in case this goes sideways.", "NTA.\nNot your responsibility to cover for her. It\u2019s nice that you have, but it\u2019s not your job to.", "NTA. It is not your responsibility. He\u2019s the manager for a reason. It\u2019s why he is paid more than you. Because if h cannot find someone to close, that\u2019s on him.", "NTA.  They need to hire a replacement and train everyone there immediately.  It\u2019s a failure by management to handle the situation appropriately.", "NTA. You are not responsible for them being shortstaffed, not responsible for them training staff on how to close and (unless you are the other parent to the fetus) you arent responsible for the pregnancy. \n\nYou have helped when you could and its not you obligation to cover her shifts. They are adults who chose to argue infront of everyone.", "NTA. You don't have to go in on your day off. I agree with u/UteLawyer that in the future you should just say \"Sorry, I'm not available.\" I agree with u/Driftwood256 that if your boss or a coworker keeps pressing after you say you're unavailable, that you should say \"I have prior, personal plans that I can't change.\"", "NTA\n\nIf you weren't scheduled, you're not required to go in. Pregnancy and other factors are irrelevant. \n\n He asks.  You say No. End of conversation.", "When I worked pizza delivery and the manager called me to cover a shift on my day off, I always told them that I had been drinking with friends (whether I actually had or not) if I did not want to come in that day.", "Or you can always go with \u201cit\u2019s my day off and I\u2019ve been drinking\u201d. Nothing they can say to that", "But the pregnant coworker was also arguing with OP in the group chat?\n\nAgain, manager\u2019s responsibility to train others on how to close but the coworker has no business making her issue OPs problem.", "The pregnant coworker became the asshole when she started arguing with OP in the group chat.", "Your final paragraph might be what op is implying.  Hiring a pregnant person who is one of two people trained to do something is pretty stupid. \n\nNot training someone else with the skills needed when a long term employee becomes pregnant is also stupid.", "It\u2019s only illegal if the company has 15 employees or more. Less than that and the employer can fire an employee for being pregnant or not hire them. Companies that small can\u2019t eat the cost of having a pregnant employee.", ">What if it was a sick coworker who had cancer? Would you do the same?\n\nWhy are people shitting on OP so much?  Where does he imply that he would think otherwise?\n\nYes of course, if you have a co worker sick with cancer and you get shit because you cant cover all their shifts, you are allowed to be frustrated that management hasn't done anything to avoid the obvious lack of availability.  \n\nLike literally I was in a similar situation woth a co worker with cancer.  None of us wished he would work, and we all wanted him to take all the time off nessesary.  Many were happy with the over times, but it's annoying getting last minute calls to work constantly, and it's annoying that progression gets slowed because of staffing issues.  Nothing about the person sick whatsoever", "You start throwing around the words \"prepaid\" and \"non refundable\" and tunes tend to change.", "Right? Judge the excuse of the person not scheduled, but the pregnant girl who misses a bunch of work who is treating pregnancy like a disability or terminal illness is not getting judged? If she can\u2019t be reliable, she should not be there burdening her coworkers. She can leave and let them hire someone who can be reliable.", "This whole situation is a management mess. A manager should not be telling one staff member about another's medical issues, especially in this context. They shouldn't be hashing this out in a group text. WTF?", "I dunno, doesn't sound like op is saying anything that bad.  \n\nHe's saying the manager should take scheduling into account for a pregnant employee.  Which....duh.", "Agreed. NTA right up until saying the manager should have taken that into consideration when hiring - absolutely not unless it is a very small business (<15) and even then really shouldn\u2019t of at all possible. So for that - ETA (except the pregnant coworker)\n\nHowever, since they have a pregnant team member, the manager should be ensuring adequate cross training to be able to have more flexible coverage when needed. Only having a couple people who can close is a great way to burn out the few staff they have.", "To be generous in interpreting OP\u2019s words, I think he could be saying that the manager should have thought about this in hiring a pregnant coworker. If they didn\u2019t anticipate the coworker may need accommodations for pregnancy, that\u2019s just dumb because they knew about the potential medical issues when they hired her. Also having the pregnant coworker as one of the only two trained people is obviously setting them up for a bad time, especially for OP.", "I agree. The first time I was pregnant come to find out (at work) that I faint randomly and fairly consistently. Only when pregnant though. I was 19 so according to op I shouldn\u2019t have worked and just what? Been homeless? Begged for handouts?", "Im honestly willing to give OP the benefit of the doubt on this one as it seems the manager keeps pestering him anytime the pregnant coworker needs time off. I can see how in a stressful environment like retail or food service (where closers are essential) some miss-directed aggression can happen. Both ways, as the manager is fostering and environment that implies both of these coworkers time off directly effects the other\u2019s availability. That is not legal.", "That\u2019s exactly what i\u2019m saying, the manager is inadvertently turning OP and this coworker against each-other when neither of them should be bawking at each-other. OP is entitled to time off and if she\u2019s pregnant she has medical exemption. It should not be at the sacrifice of eachother.", "Because, it's true that it's not his job, and not his responsibility.... But is the way that he frased it. \nBy saying \"his legs were sore from the gym\", as if it is equivalent to being pregnant. \nTaking into consideration her \"pregnancy-related issues when making the hiring decision\", so that it doesn't take a toll on him. \nI don't know, it is a very individualistic frame of mind, for change to happen and to have better wages for women, everyone must chip in, as a society we should all be working towards it. \nI get what you are saying, but he's not describing the same situation as yours. You are saying that it was frustrating, but he's implying that she shouldn't have been hired in the first place.", "Now, if it is a high risk pregnancy or something like that that OP doesn't know about, and couldn't possibly know about unless she were to disclose that, then it's perfectly reasonable to treat the pregnancy similar to a disability, because it could be detrimental to the health of the mother or the fetus if they don't listen to doctors instructions.\nThat still doesn't make it OP's problem, but it's rude to assume that she's faking pregnancy problems and pretty bold.", "Ugh I had glossed right over the group text part.", "And larger companies can use your medical absences against you if they are too many & excessive.  A co-worker was getting that band around their stomach & they were calling in 2 times a week for medical reasons but was still let go because they called in to much.", "It\u2019s only illegal if the company is 15 employees or larger. Smaller than that and the employer likely can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be expected to cover the cost of having a pregnant employee. The pregnancy discrimination act literally doesn\u2019t apply if there are less than 15 employees. He can straight up fire her for being pregnant.", "In the US they can't not hire you due to pregnancy.", "I didn\u2019t say anyone was faking anything.", "Sure, but i\u2019m going to assume that when he says \u201cclose\u201d he means retail or food service, and while there are plenty of mom and pop stores it\u2019s safe to assume that OP works for some sort of chain, right?", "You should take into account that younger women get pregnant yes.  \n\nJust like you should older people may need time off for age related health issues.  \n\nThe solution is obviously proper cross training and hiring policies including temps.  Not sure why you jump right to \"don't hire them\".", "This is literally the kind of thinking that makes it harder for women to get hired in a lot of jobs.\n\nEdit: Same with older people. That\u2019s why both are illegal. Full stop. \n\n(My phone decided to cut me off.)", "Because I was showing how thinking this way leads to sexism in the workplace. \n\nIn the US and many other places it is illegal to ask questions about their family life at the interview stage. You should offer all employees adequate PTO and schedule your employees so you don\u2019t have to call people on their day off. That\u2019s the solution, not treating people different based on their gender or age."]}
