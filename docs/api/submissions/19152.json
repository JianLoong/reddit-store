Just a little back story, but I used to be kind of \u201ctrashy\u201d so she used to call it, in the sense that I had a mullet and wore Pit Vipers all the time. Picture what Theo Von looks like, that\u2019s kind of what I was looking like before. Well I got rid of the mullet and now I just wear the Vipers because I think they\u2019re cool. Aside from that, we both currently work full time, and I\u2019m also a full time student. \n\nMy wife decided to tell me last week she set up a surprise for me for Fathers Day and said \u201cI set up a photoshoot for you and James to take pictures together and make it like a \u201ctrashy\u201d photoshoot.\u201d I loved this idea because inside I still feel like I\u2019m that person.

I asked how much they would cost and she said she wasn\u2019t sure so I had to ask about the price. So I just said okay and found a date that we were free. My wife knows the date planned.

I also have a set work schedule 3 days a week (I work in a hospital so I work three 12 hour shifts) and I go to school every Monday and Wednesday. Tuesday and Saturday I have off. She knows this, as my schedule hasn\u2019t changed in a few months.

After the beach we went out to lunch,  and we also went and got banana splits after lunch because she was talking about them the entire week before Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nI also bought her a giant inflatable screen so she could watch movies on a big screen in the back yard with a projector.

They did. Wife still 100% dropped the ball and was an AH here to turn it around on OP being the problem", "NTA", "Yes, I understood, thanks. I edited my comment. Agree it\u2019s all on wife, but understandable that she would assume he set the time with photographer, since he was the one making arrangements with them.", "This is little different than her saying \u201cI\u2019ll bake you a cake for your birthday,\u201d and asking you what type of cake you want.  Later as your birthday rolls around, she tells you go buy a cookbook, look up the cake you want, go buy the ingredients listed and then follow the instructions for mixing and baking. \n\nIt\u2019s not a gift if you have to do all the work.  NTA", "NTA. You are 100% correct. She's playing the reverse victim card.", "NTA. Her response was immature AF. Instead of taking accountability she throws a fit.

I wonder who was going to end up paying for it...", "NTA, maybe, but I need INFO\n\nThis reminds me of many, many posts around Mother's Day and all the women who were expected to plan their own day and buy their own presents.\n\nI'm wondering how you dealt with Mother's Day for your wife. Maybe you were the AH then and she's giving equal treatment back to you?", "Is your wife doing well atm? Like is she overburdened with work/home life? I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a reason she forgot to go ahead with planning your gift. It\u2019s strange to come up with such a thoughtful idea and then fail to follow through, but I\u2019d understand why she hasn\u2019t if she has other stuff going on that\u2019s burning through her energy. \n\nDefinitely sounds like she felt bad for not planning the gift and that\u2019s why she attacked - which is an asshole move and she really should apologise for it.", "I hate that she thinks that you wearing your hair a certain way and wearing certain things makes you trashy when she is literally trash. Sounds like you're a king and your queen needs to step up or step back.", "She despises you. She hates you. She is actively trying to mold you into her type of man. She's also a massive gaslighter.\n\nI can't believe you married this bich.", "ESH. Talk to your wife not to us. This is all about communication.", "Yes", "NTA- Also, bring back the mullet!!!", "NTA lol\n\nOnce my sister kade me a cake for my birthday... Except she actually just bought the ingredients and I made it.", "NTA. A gift that requires you to plan It is not a gift, it\u2019s an obligation and honestly It sounds like she\u2019s making fun of you. She didn\u2019t say why don\u2019t you do things with him you like, she said have a \u201ctrashy photoshoot\u201d that really rubs me the wrong way", "Jeez NTA. \nIf I make or plan a gift for my husband it\u2019s planned out and bought months in advance. For fathers\u2019 day I\u2019ve had his present hidden in the house for months already.

Lol", "NTA bc apparently when your wife said \u201cplanned\u201d .. what she actually meant was \u201chad an idea\u201d .. and that\u2019s as far as she took it. Sorry but having an idea.. is not a gift. Especially when  the gift recipient is then made responsible for carrying it out\u2026 how is this not obvious to your wife? I\u2019m guessing she knows you\u2019re right and is DARVOing you to avoid that fact.", "NTA. \n\nWhat even did I just read? \n\nSo she tells you her idea for the gift, so already not a surprise anyways, and then expects you to do all the planning? She didn't even set up the photographer? Or order the sunglasses? Also, how hard is it to simply ask \"Hey what is your schedule on this week?\" \n\nThat is a really crappy gift, because it's not a gift...it's an obligation on your part. I don't know how someone can suck all the enjoyment out of a gift but she sure did.", "NTA lol, it\u2019s like that episode of the office when both Michael and Jim were co managers, day to day versus big picture. She can only manage big picture apparently. Her having an idea doesn\u2019t count as a gift, then she flipped out when you called her on it.", "Tell her you got her a 2nd honeymoon - but she needs to set it up and pick the dates, buy everything you need to take with you,  get the plane tickets, find someone to watch the baby, get the hotel, and get the rental car.  But she better thank you for getting her the best gift ever", "INFO: How did you handle her Mother\u2019s Day stuff?", "NTA \n\nYeah, I wouldn't let her flip this on you. She has seriously dropped the ball here. Talk it out.\n\nAlso analyze if this is part of a bigger pattern of behavior. Does she frequently make big promises and never follow through? Get mad and lash out when you bring up a legitimate point of complaint? Dump the majority of responsibility on you? Try to weasel out of things with childish excuses?\n\nAs a suggestion for when the photo shoot happens, they make baby/ toddler onesies with \"tattoo sleeves\", which may be a very fun addition to your photo shoot.", "NTA she pawned off the whole planning to you. She\u2019s in the wrong and it\u2019s very rude of her. She\u2019s upset you called her out but don\u2019t let it go. She needs to take over the planning. It\u2019s disappointing your having to do all the leg work.", "NTA lol she said \u201chere\u2019s something u can do\u201d and that\u2019s a GIFT??? Please", "Yeah, definitely not the ah, your wife was rude, and had the audacity to play the victim as you held her accountable for her lack of actions for \"her surprise gift for you on Father's day\" and the excuse of \"not knowing when you would be free\" is also cap, since, as you stated, you both write your full schedules, and, your schedule has not changed for months.", "It's not a gift if you're the one planning it. She's the asshole for telling you she has a surprise,makes you do all the planning and then tries playing the victim when called out for it.That's some serious childish behavior and chances are it's not going to be a one time thing", "NTA, but you had a kid with her? Let me guess, his name is DARVO.", "NTA. That's not a gift, at best it's an *idea* she gave you.", "NTA - I hate this type of \u201cgift\u201d where the giver makes others do the work.", "NTA She just hand an idea. Whew... good luck with that.", "My brother used to get his wife at the time brochures to travel destinations.

RIGHT?!?", "She didn't even get halfway, lol, she had an idea and pretty much told op to take over from there.", "Same, I was trying to decide how it would be \"trashy\" to walk around draped in a venomous snake.", "What if she is flipping what happened on Mother's Day to him on Father's Day? Ever consider this might be tit for tat?", "Hey babe I was thinking for mother's day you should go to the spa. Babysitting? Transportation? Payment? Nah, I don't know your schedule.", "Exactly! This sounds like every Mother\u2019s Day gift everywhere. I wonder if she is giving him the same energy she got at Mother\u2019s Day? That\u2019s what would help me decide.
