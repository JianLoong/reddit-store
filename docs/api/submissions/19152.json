The mental load in a lot of relationships falls on the woman. If you ever visit the workingmoms sub, you will see this a Lot. \n\nFirst, if your post regarding planning mother's day reflects how much you help with the mental load at your house, thank you for setting a good 'guy' example for your son to follow.\n\nSecond, check out the information on mental load in the home and communicate on how this needs to be shared equally.\n\nIf your wife carries the mental load on everything else (schedules doctor appointments, gets son there, makes grocery list, buys groceries, plans menu and cooks it, schedules repairs, plans maintenance items...) then I can see why she would dump this on you, but that's not what I am reading in your post.", "Woww your wife is an asshole and extremely lazy. So she basically gifted you an idea lol...\n\nI'd love it if someone planned a day for me like you did for your wife.", "NTA", "INFO: Why are you two married? You both seem incredibly resentful of each other. You didn\u2019t say a single nice thing about her during this entire post and apparently she sees the real you as \u201ctrashy\u201d.", "No I have been in similar situations, you aren\u2019t the a hole.", "NTA! \n\nDude, if you can\u2019t execute a gift idea\u2026 don\u2019t put it out there. So rude of her.", "NTA. Your wife sounds like she has some issues, ESPECIALLY if she likes to search your main Reddit account.", "NTA.\n\nShe isn't planning a nice surprise for Father's Day. She had a good idea, then left you to set up everything for your present. Including expecting you to order the glasses for your son.\n\nAnd then when you are justifiably disappointed, she turns it around so that she can be the victim. As if you should be greatful for providing your own Father's Day surprise.", "NTA and in my opinion she is definitely lacking and was being a completely horrible wife.", "NTA", "NTA. For it to be a gift, she would've had everything all set up. All you and your son should have had to do is show up for the photoshoot. She's not a bad wife. She's just bad at hiding that she forgot to get you a gift. She, quite obviously, pulled this idea from her ass. It's a very fun and cool idea, to be sure. But sadly, she had to take it from the idea phase and actually get it set up for it to actually be a gift.", "NTA your wife us the big A!!", "She didn't give you a gift. She gave you an idea, which you then had to execute.\n\nNTA", "Sounds like the only thing she gave you for Father\u2019s Day was A Good Idea. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. What an awesome, thoughtful and hilarious surprise that would\u2019ve been if she actually saw it through to the end.", "NTA. Her gift to you was the equivalent of saying: \u201dHey, I\u2019m gonna treat you to a vacation this summer. Doesn\u2019t Italy sound nice? We could see the Colosseum, the Vatican, visit a vinyard, enjoy proper pizza\u2026 You pick the dates, book the tickets, book a hotel, draft a vacation schedule and pay for everything and we\u2019re good to go! You\u2019re welcome!\u201d", "NTA. Very similar to the idea of \u201cI\u2019ll plan a vacation for us!\u201d but then they only pick the city, and you\u2019re left planning the transportation, booking a hotel, booking outings, etc.", "NTA. Doesn't sound like a gift at all. Sounds like she came up with an idea, wants it done and wants you to get it done, its more like a gift for her.", "NTA\n\n\"Gifts\" that are just 85% work, planning, and in this case spending money, are shitty gifts.", "NTA she may have realized your correct that she pushed the details off on you. Let it play out, in the long run you will love having the photos and so will she.", "Nta", "Definately NTA. Also I also think the \"trashy\" comment is really mean. I could never imagine calling my partner trashy. And it seems as if the wife actually means it and it isn't only supposed to be funny.\n\nImagine OP being a woman and the husband calling his wife trashy. Everybody would be pointing that out.", "Yes! Exactly. This is an important distinction. I asked my husband once to pick up flowers for a friend whose family member had died. He bought outdoor flowering bushes that needed to be planted. I was like- I know you didn\u2019t just buy these poor people whose young family member had a sudden traumatic death a chore to do\u2026", "Really well said", ">As a father. Father\u2019s Day is more a joke and always has been.\n\nMaybe to you? Weirdo.", "That's one word for it \ud83d\ude02", "My new response to that is always \"your words not mine\", it's entertaining seeing them flip a switch from upset victim to pissed off and angry all over again.", "weaponized incompetence so you\u2019ll never ask him again", "It\u2019s the thought that counts. Some people might like having a living thing to plant, and if not, no harm done. Unusual, perhaps not ideal, but not a huge faux pas.", "Need a reason to call the man an AH", "is that the same thing as \"gaslighting\"?", "I did not know what this is but hey, my narcissistic dad does this so it just confirms what I already knew about him, that he is a manipulator. I\u2019m glad I know this term now, though.", "This is like when people call everything trauma. DARVO is used to describe a particular behavior of a perpetrator in an abusive relationship. We\u2019ve seen one tiny bit of this relationship, and not enough to determine if his gf is an abuser. I\u2019m not saying her behavior is good or healthy, but when you overuse clinical terminology incorrectly you diminish the term.", "I mean, it should\u2019ve been Mandy Patinkin\u2019s voice, but I\u2019ll allow it.", "This sub is really one sided about that shit.", "Because you took a standard in your relationship that is unusual and used it as a foundation of logic that accuses the OP of being an asshole when he's behaving as most people would in his situation.  \n\n\nNot to mention that your comment misunderstands why he's upset. He isn't mad that he isn't getting a gift (maybe he would be but we can't really know that from the one post we have), he's mad that a gift was dangled in front of him and then his partner effectively took it away by making him do all the work. Would you be upset if your wife said she was going to get you something that relates to a hobby you enjoy, then later you find out she expects you to actually take all the steps necessary to get the present, thereby only actually contributing the idea of the present? She said she'd get it for you, but you actually had to get it for yourself.", "Sounds like you're more upset at your own ignorance.", "Pit Vipers and Shit Diapers for that XXXtra Klassy touch.", "Unfortunately if you are in certain situations you have no choice but to do as they say, and apologize, say an abusive situation, for example, but giving them push back, can help. It may not make them realize their wrongdoings, but it shows them you aren\u2019t weak and won\u2019t be pushed around, and as long as it doesn\u2019t put you in physical harms way, it can be used to help.", "I\u2019ve been married 42 yeas and together for 45 years. I\u2019m the ultimate pragmatist, if I want something I get it. My wife is the same way. She actually asked me to stop buying her jewelry because she had enough. We have worked hard and we\u2019ve been successful, but never in our relationship have we expected gifts from one another. It just seems petty to me as there\u2019s much more important thing then gratuitous gifts.", "Again, you're completely missing the point. Let's reframe this. If someone promised you they'd do something, like a chore, and then you found out later that they hadn't done it and you actually had to do it, would that bother you?", ">She didn't make him question the reality\n\nWhats OP doing in AITA then", "It\u2019s not a big deal. But asking once is one thing, asking again a few comments later is another. And it could continue. They\u2019re not 7 years old (presumably). Just look it up.", "By that logic is everyone who's NTA here being gaslit?", "Bravo.", "thats makes no sense  \ni'm talking especially about op here", "Okay then she didn't make him question reality, she made him question himself which is why he's here on AITA. To see if he's right he came here. Which imo he is."]}
