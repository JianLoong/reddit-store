Just a little back story, but I used to be kind of \u201ctrashy\u201d so she used to call it, in the sense that I had a mullet and wore Pit Vipers all the time. Picture what Theo Von looks like, that\u2019s kind of what I was looking like before. Well I got rid of the mullet and now I just wear the Vipers because I think they\u2019re cool. Aside from that, we both currently work full time, and I\u2019m also a full time student. \n\nMy wife decided to tell me last week she set up a surprise for me for Fathers Day and said \u201cI set up a photoshoot for you and James to take pictures together and make it like a \u201ctrashy\u201d photoshoot.\u201d I loved this idea because inside I still feel like I\u2019m that person. She said she wanted to set it up like both of us on a lawnmower, make it look like a hick dad holding his kid who is also wearing baby Vipers. The ideas hilarious to me and I\u2019m all for it. \n\nWell the person who is doing the photos is my coworker and my wife is also friends with her. Let\u2019s call her Katie. I found out about the photos and my wife said \u201cTalk to Katie and set up a date.\u201d I said okay, but I also thought she planned it already. I asked how much they would cost and she said she wasn\u2019t sure so I had to ask about the price. So I just said okay and found a date that we were free. My wife knows the date planned. We didn\u2019t get a time yet at that moment. \n\nI asked my wife yesterday when the baby vipers would arrive in the mail because the pictures are next week. She said she never ordered them, so I said, \u201cOh, well I\u2019ll order them I guess,\u201d and she said, \u201cNo it\u2019s fine I\u2019ll just order them.\u201d \n\nToday my wife asked me what time the photoshoot is next week with Katie, and I said \u201cI\u2019m not sure I thought you were planning it for me.\u201d She said she doesn\u2019t know my schedule, which is a lie because we both write out schedules on a calendar in the kitchen. I also have a set work schedule 3 days a week (I work in a hospital so I work three 12 hour shifts) and I go to school every Monday and Wednesday. Tuesday and Saturday I have off. She knows this, as my schedule hasn\u2019t changed in a few months. I told her I would figure out a time and she said \u201cno it\u2019s fine I\u2019ll just handle it.\u201d I told her \u201cFor something you wanted to surprise me with for Fathers Day, it really feels like I\u2019m just planning the whole thing.\u201d\n\nShe got mad and said \u201cWow I must be the worst wife ever I\u2019ll try and do better from now on since I\u2019m so horrible.\u201d She told me I was being an asshole and now she isn\u2019t talking to me. \n\nI just felt like this was meant to be a surprise for me, and I\u2019m literally just planning all of it.

There've been times when my wife would say \"why don't you just buy something you really want for fathers day?\" because she couldn't think of anything and I hadn't told her what I want.

It's called track switching in which she is replacing a fight she can't win with a fight she might win.\n\nThe best way to resolve that is to avoid the new track. \" Yes honey, you are right the next time I'll share my disappointment differently.\" Then return to the point on hand. The admission of an error of judgement night also allow her to step away from her wounded pride.\n\nI'm guessing she feels embarrassed by how it's going and you voiced how she felt about it.
