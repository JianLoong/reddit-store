We have a pool in our backyard, and we love it. We have family gatherings at our house fairly often. I have a large family, and we are all very close with each other. We love having all the kids over to swim, and we welcome them over pretty much whenever they want. Well, one of my cousins (38)who lives out of state has only been to my house maybe only a handful of times. Her daughter has special needs. She (12) has Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and has the mental capacity of a 4 year old. She also has severe bladder and bowl control issues. She also needs constant supervision because she has a habit of screaming and biting herself if she gets stressed out. I love both of them to pieces, and love when they do visit, but when they do, I cover the pool and keep it off limits. When I first moved into, she had an accident in the pool, even though she was wearing a pool diaper. It caused a big mess, and we had to hire a cleaner who ended up having to drain the pool. After that accident, my husband and I mutually agreed that it wouldn't be a good idea to let her swim here anymore. She's more than welcome to visit, but we would just make swimming off limits. Well, my cousin tends to get offended whenever she feels like her daughter is singled out, so to avoid making her feel  that way, we just cover the pool, and make it off limits for everyone for the time that they are with us. Everytime she comes over, she asks why the pool is covered. We lie and say that there's a filter issue, and we're waiting for the pool cleaner to come fix it. Everyone else knows the truth, and covers for us if she ever were to ask. Well, a few weeks ago, she called me and angerly confronts me. Turns out my aunt, her mom, threw me under the bus. She accused me of never loving her daughter, and hate it when they visit. I told her that that was completely untrue, but she wouldn't listen. She said that I'm a despicable p.o.s for \"not accepting\" her daughter, and should be happy to clean up after her. I told her I was sorry that I made her feel that way, and that I didn't mean to, but I just didn't feel comfortable having a child with severe incontinence swimming in the pool. Then she said that they're never visiting ever again. My husband agrees with me. The rest of the family is understanding, but feel that I should be more understanding of her struggles. So now I'm wondering if I was wrong.
