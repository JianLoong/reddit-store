I'd have done it right off the bat, as it seems that his ex-wife and kids seemed to think they had some sort of right to walk right into your home and make off with his possessions.\n\nHow I wish people would write up living wills and get them notarized. It would put a stop to so much bullshit and harassment of widows and widowers if the deceased had left legal instructions about what was to be done with his or her personal belongings.\n\nMy husband and adult son both know my will, and I've no doubt it will be done according to my wishes. I favor cremation as it's the least expensive option. If I could afford it though, there is a new option for composting human remains. It costs around $7,000 to do, and takes between 4-6 weeks for the body to completely decompose and become usable 'soil'. There is an organization that offers this service a few towns away, and if the family wants some of the soil for their gardens, it's offered. The rest goes to an area that is currently being 'reforested'. In this way, I'd return to the earth and wouldn't be polluting the earth with embalming chemicals, tooth fillings, etc. I'd become part of the planet, and part of the circle of life. \n\nI'm so very sorry for the loss of your husband. And I'm outraged over his family's behavior and treatment of you.", "NTA, what the holy hell?

You said you have a lawyer but also record every interaction you have with anyone regarding inheritance or threats and report EVERYTHING to the police. Keep track of every financial aspect because they will resort to anything in order to get money or properties. People have no limits when it comes to get what they think they deserve or they are owed. Secure yourself legally and financially and please, please, don't let anyone bully you into giving away your husband's inheritance.\nHe built a life with you and he'd want you to be safe and financially and emotionally stable.\nI truly hope you can get trough the battle and can have time to mourn and find yourself after this.", "Don\u2019t change the plan.

You got that off your chest? Are you done now? Are you done disrespecting what ____ wanted? Do you hate him so much that you would go against what he wished for his kids and those he left behind? You say you love him, but your actions say you don\u2019t give a damn about what he actually wanted about HIS money, HIS belongings and HIS dang body.  So I ask again\u2026..are you done disrespecting him and his memory?\u201d \n\nYou are doing what he wanted OP. He trusted you to follow his wishes and what he wanted to happen for those he left behind. You didn\u2019t expect it to happen so soon, and this twisted greediness from his family is so horrid.

They wanted him buried far away and he didn't want to be buried, but did not want to be buried where everyone wanted him buried even less; however, in order to keep some semblance of peace, I agreed to the burial, but I insisted that he be buried where I could visit him instead of having him buried thousands of miles away which would absolve his family of any guilt of not visiting.\n\nHis whole casket is biodegradable."]}
