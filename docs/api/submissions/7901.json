My husband wanted to be cremated and wanted some of his ashes scattered in two separate places. His mother tried to fight me on that. I hated her (and still do, for so many reasons) and the funeral director told her point blank they will listen to no one but me as the surviving spouse. My husband had two children at the time, one was a teenage son, so I asked him if he wanted to pick an urn for his family for some of his father\u2019s ashes as well, and he did. One urn was for the scatter ashes and I have my urn. \n\nAfter the funeral, I received a letter from an attorney, thanks to husband\u2019s brother and mother, that said I needed to pay the ~$6k for having their family urn buried in a fucking wall (columbarium niche) where the funeral took place. Let me tell you, I LOST MY SHIT. I immediately hired a lawyer to send a response letter saying that I had honored my husband\u2019s wishes, I had paid for the cremation, funeral, urns, etc. and what they did with \u201ctheir\u201d urn after that, was not my responsibility. I had scattered his ashes in the two places he wanted as well. \n\nI know the funeral is over and you\u2019ve already been through that part with the ex, children and family, but you are not required to listen to anyone about anything that pertains to YOUR HUSBAND! It doesn\u2019t matter that he was married to the ex, and he was someone\u2019s son. At the end of his life, he was your husband. End of story.

You are doing the right thing by everything you did and hiring an attorney.  How old are the children?  You say the one is under 25? But sounds like an adult.  You could try talking to him, let him know you are willing to work with him and the siblings, but their mom has no rights what so ever and you will not deal with her at all, nor does she have any say in anything.  If he comes across as unwilling, you tell him, you tried, any further contact should be thru your attorney.", "NTA\n\nBut since she already stole financial documents and suspiciously had his wallet, you need to be moving as fast as possible to handle his affairs. My mom was in the same situation while pregnant with me. She was a new widow, and my dad's high school ex gf whom he had a kid with begged for a copy of the death certificate pretending that she needed to sign up for survivors benefits for their kid. Instead she ran straight to his bank and wiped all our accounts pretending to be the widow. \n\nThe bank told my mom the next week essentially \"too bad, so sad\", so all the savings he put aside for me and for my mom's recovery were gone. They said she couldn't even file a police report or sue the baby mama because, while she lied about being widowed, she didn't bring in a fake marriage certificate but *did* have a death certificate in hand. They also practically called my mom an idiot for giving out copies of the death cert before handling the most important affairs, as if that's something a 24 y/o widow would know. \n\nSorry for your loss and all the stress you're dealing with, but you need to know there are things not even the court system can help you with if they try to sneak around and steal from the estate.", "How old are these kids? What a way to be thinking when your parent has unexpectedly passed away!", "I suspect their mom has twisted them to think that way. Its appalling but true that many people become greedy vultures when someone dies. That's absolutely a learned behavior. My dad passed away suddenly this past Memorial Day. Neither my brother or I ever even THOUGHT that way. Even when my Mom brings up us now being beneficiaries and what's left of his 401k, I dismiss it entirely. I don't care what there is. I just want to be there for my Mom and make sure she is still able to continue to live in the new home they built near me Summer of 2021. My brother and I already had the conversation that ANY decisions about his belongings will be a group discussion. Being the eldest and the one closest to her (I'm a 40 min drive, he's 10 hrs away in another state) I'm not at all looking forward to the day where I will need to deal with things when she passes. I still get immensely anxious when she doesn't respond to a text or call right away. When the day comes, they raised two sons who do not and will not act like greedy animals."]}
