If you\u2019re male, you\u2019re her fianc\u00e9. \n\nESH \u2014 you should have set a reminder, but she could chill out. \n\nTry calling the restaurant, though. Maybe they have a cancellation list.", "NTA. Restaurants that do reservations like this sell out SO FAST.

She is disappointed. (Her reaction seems a little bit like an overreaction but I get it) You did the only thing you can do & signed up for any spot that opens up. Not much more you can do it but own it as a mistake & try to fix it. \n\nSince you already have planned this trip, you could always just take her to the bar for at least a birthday cocktail. If this is the only mistake you make in this relationship your fianc\u00e9e is a lucky woman.\n\nETA \u2014 If the only meaningful part of this trip for fianc\u00e9e was dinner reservations at this restaurant then she should\u2019ve set reminders for herself to book the reservation ... who cares who books it. Isn\u2019t the goal just to go & eat? (But... I have been married for 31 years so I would never expect my husband to remember to do that or even remember the name of the restaurant)\n\nETA more \u2014 I am curious though why everyone accepts for a fact he could\u2019ve magically booked this reservation 3 days ago. There are no guarantees that would have happened. Seems like they both forgot until 3 days after start of month. If he tried 3 days ago & there were no reservations would he still be the AH?

Did you try calling them directly and see if there are any cancelations?", "NTA since ppl can ofc forget things since we\u2019re all human but i can understand her frustration since from what i read it was something she really wanted to do and reminded you a few times but unfortunately it was too late.", "NTA.

You weren't intentionally not making the reservation. How spoiled is this bratty girlfriend of yours anyway? You can just make the reservation for later. If she is remotely mature she should be able to accept this.", "YTA for calling her ungrateful. What a cheap cop out that is.\n\nYou booked the weekend away, which is nice. But she asked you for 1 thing, and you missed out on it because of your own shortcomings. And I say that as a forgetful person. It's not the end of the world, but it is your fault. Learn to accept that. Apologising is actually freeing, if you have the guts to do it.\n\nIf you make a mistake, it is on you to own that and apologise. Not to attack the other person for rightly being disappointed or rightly pointing out you made a mistske.  \n\nYour relationship won't last long if you can't be graceful when you made a mistake. Learn to apologise and learn to set alarms on your own. \n\nAlso, she is your fianc\u00e9e and you are her fianc\u00e9. When we took the loan word from French it remained gendered.", "NTA.  And consider yourself lucky!  You found out she doesn\u2019t care about you before you got married.  If she truly loved you, she wouldn\u2019t have reacted this way.

I personally would call directly to see if they have any openings and ask to be put on the wait list for that weekend if not.\n\nAlso a note about the GF, if this is her first time being ungrateful for things out of your control, procede cautiously, if not maybe cancel the whole thing, including the relationship.", "NTA. It would be disappointing for sure, but not worth getting mad at a partner over. Tell her next time she can be in charge of organizing and booking an entire trip, then get on her case when she misses one thing. See how that turns out for you.

A little maybe.\nBut you didn't do it intentionally.\n\nCouldn't she have made the reservations herself?", "NTA \n\nIt was an honest mistake, and the moment you realized it, you took action.

Ask if there\u2019s a list you can put your name on for any cancellations. If they don\u2019t have a list, call everyday to check if anyone canceled.

My partner and I both apologise for small fuck ups on a regular basis, neither of us holds resentment long. I dont know why you are so mad at the idea of someone apologising. Maybe consider therapy.

He doesn't say exactly how she reacted or what she said other than that she brought it up and said she had asked him for something - which is not a lie.  She is allowed to ask him to do something. He is allowed to forget or mess up, as we all are. But she's also allowed to talk about the fact things didn't work out.  \n\nHe said that she was angry and in his words had a \"nasty attitude \" - in his words without any explanation of what she said or how she acted. Which can mean anything given this is a guy who fucked up and has given no indication that he apologised. \n\nHe has said nothing about the tone of their conversations or what HIS side of the conversation was like, so I'll reserve judgement on how nasty her attitude was or how ungrateful she is until more information. It wouldn't be the first time someone messed up but tried to make themselves look better on AITA.  Or only showed one half of the story, conveniently.\n\nAnd again, discussion and moving on are usually more important than who was right.

He wants it or it matters to him: it happens. Every time. Full stop. \n\nBecause I grew up being given very little care so I learned it felt bad and try not to do that. I also learned not to communicate my needs. \n\nSo when I finally and rarely do, especially if it\u2019s really just a want/preference, and he doesn\u2019t jump to figure it out and make it happen(especially like a reservation) it feels less like he messed up and more like he fully doesn\u2019t care about me or things important to me. \n\nI\u2019ve needed to learn how to communicate about that too\u2026 but just some perspective on why her reaction might seem disproportionate. \n\nOr she\u2019s a greedy jerk. You\u2019d know best\u2026 but try to use some critical thinking skills here to really understand it. \n\nGood luck!", "Very very soft YTA. Honestly, though, even if you had jumped on the website the moment reservations opened, you still might not have gotten in if it is a really popular spot in a touristy area.  My suggestions:\n\n1.  Make sure you have your text notifications set so that you will know right away if a spot opens up on the waitlist, even if it\u2019s in the middle of the night. You aren\u2019t the only one on the waitlist, and you need to jump on it as soon as possible. \n\n2.  Call the concierge at the hotel where you are staying and ask them to help you. I have heard that some restaurants hold back a small number of tables from their online res system just for this purpose. The concierge might not be able to do anything for you until you are actually there at the hotel. Plan to tip generously if they can help. \n\n3.  Call the restaurant and explain how much your fianc\u00e9e wants to go there for her birthday. Understand that they probably get calls like this all the time, so keep expectations low, but be super polite. \n\n4.  Does the chef/restaurateur have another restaurant nearby that might be easier to get into?  If so, the menu might be similar, food just as good, though the ambiance more casual. \n\n5.  Plan a future surprise trip to the same destination if you can make sure to get a reservation. \n\n6. Look for a restaurant closer to where you live that is similar to the one your fianc\u00e9e wants to go to, and do a surprise date night there. What is special about the restaurant for her?\n\n\nSource:  I went to Napa in the fall with my sisters and we really wanted to go to French Laundry, all of us were in the website the minute we could have made reservations, and we couldn\u2019t get anything during the three days we would be there.  We instead made lunch reservations at Bouchon Bistro (another Thomas Keller restaurant) and it was delicious.  At some point I did get a waitlist notification from French Laundry, but by the time I clicked on it, the spot was taken.", "YTA. You may have planned the weekend which was nice- but what she really wanted and was explicit about was to go to this restaurant. There isn\u2019t an excuse to not have a reminder on your phone.", "YTA.  Pick up the damn phone and speak to a person.  People cancel / move reservations all the time and they don\u2019t always make it back to the online scheduler.

People tend to forget .", "NAH - just call and make a reservation for next weekend. Tell your fiance you're extending her birthday.", "ESH \nYou already know you are forgetful, so maybe you should have put a reminder.\n\nAnd she should have reacted better, you planned a HOLE weekend for her, not just one evening.", "YTA you know it means you need AT LEAST a month in advance, right? like it's not meant to be EXACTLY a month out, you could have booked right when she first mentioned it. There was no reason at all to wait", "YTA  I suspect this is not the first time you've \"forgotten\", my husband and I had the same go around and  it's beyond irritating. If his friend invited him to go hunting on November 3rd at 5:30am in 2029 I can guarantee he'd have his waders on. HIS dog needed to go to the vet ( we board the dog so it impacts me). I made the appt, sent him a reminder, wrote it on the calendar and the day of the appt I was screaming at him because he now had 15 fucking minutes and if he didn't get there we would lose our $70 deposit.

So yes, YTA and a massive one.", "YTA you didn't even try", "Ive been in your fiancees position and would agree soft YTA. \n\n1. You should do the actions that prevent you from making mistakes, like setting reminders\n\n2. It hurts when you tell your partner how much something means to you and then they don't have the thoughtfulness to prioritize that specific thing. That's how it always feels to me: the partner is being unthoughtful, he is telling himself \"I know better, these other things I am providing are what she wants or will be satisfied with, so the important thing doesn't need to be the priority\".\n\n3. In truth all I ever want is for the guy to own the mistake. Admit it is a mistake without causing a fight and saying my feelings are \"not a big deal\" or that I am \"overreacting\". Try to solve the problem. Commit to a habit that will prevent the mistake from ever happening again, because the real nail in the coffin is seeing the same things get neglected over and over from something as dumb as not setting a reminder, that feeling is the worst *in a relationship. In this case the best solution up in the thread was to book the restaurant immediately and extend the trip imo, that sounds cheaper than losing your $600 you can't get back.\n\nObviously if she is truly being \"nasty\" that is not cool but I can't judge that from the post. But I know if my partner did this I would be disappointed for multiple days and still feel bummed out years later that I visited X city and now need to get back there to see/do that thing.", "YTA. How hard is it to set a reminder on your phone?

Seeing as this isn't a surprise for her birthday, she could have made the reservations. I normally handle that kind of thing for my husband, cause it's easier for me to deal with paperwork etc. But that is how we have things set up.

To be fair, that\u2019s a fairly weird reservation policy. You tried to book over a month out, and then 3 days into a month? Yeah kinda weird and she should understand. Try to book it near her birthday and reiterate what happened. \n\nIf she can\u2019t laugh about it with you and get a res a week or 2 after her bday, that\u2019s a little too spoiled", "ESH. You should have set a reminder to book this place day one of the reservations opening, yeah\u2026but also why didn\u2019t she just book it if it was so important and knows you are forgetful? Why are you in charge of everything for this trip? Sounds like you two need to communicate better and assign certain duties to one another for planning if it\u2019s so problematic. I do all the important planning for reservations in my relationship for this exact reason. Hopefully you both can still enjoy the rest of the getaway. Call the place directly and ask to be called (not texted, since you can easily miss that notification before the allotted time to book) if a reservation opens. Better yet, ask them to call (or text if they refuse to call) your partner instead. You should also make a back up reservation elsewhere immediately, so you at least have another option in the likely event that nothing opens up.", "YTA, you should\u2019ve been better at managing time.

For example, exactly 30 days beforehand or even something more specific like 10 AM on the first Tuesday of January for any reservation in March. And oftentimes, you\u2019re not getting those reservations if you\u2019re not booking within the first few minutes of the release.", "I feel like people are also missing the fact that I tried to book it twice.

He wants to go downtown to shop but doesn\u2019t care where we eat at? I\u2019ll make a reservation for my favorite restaurant.

I hate that we need two words!  This is the problem with using words from other languages who gender all their nouns.\n\nThere's no good reason to gender it in English and far easier to just have one word.

Tell them that you promised your fiance, but didn\u2019t make the reservation in time, and now you are in a tight spot.", "It's gendered because it is a French loan word. It essentially means \"to promise\", so because she is a woman who you have been \"promised to\", it gets an extra \"e\" on the end (she is the promisee and thus the gender is \"measured\" from her perspective, French adds an extra \"e\" for feminine words in most cases).", "Definitely sounds like it\u2019s the place to be! Hopefully, it all works out for them. \n\nMy husband tried for like a month to get a tee time for us at a well known golf club. We were only going to have a day to fit it in during our trip.

Sometimes, you just have to be in the right place & the right time.", "No, if your partner tells you how important something is over and over and then they have to remind you when it's time to make the reservation because you missed it by three days, AND YOUR PARTNER HAS TO REMIND YOU, that's an asshole move.

She should dump you ASAP and RUN!", "I have no clue why you're being downvoted for this. $600 is not a small amount of money to throw away and you made a mistake.

They may have contacts at the restaurant to get you a reservation.\n\nETA: also like the social media pages of the restaurant and join local foodie groups/subreddits. Sometimes people can\u2019t make the reservation and transfer/sell them. You can also post an ISO request.", "I think this is a lesson learned in diligence.

In theory, we shouldn't need to plan our own best presents.\n\nThat said:  sometimes we have to own our presents when we really REALLY want them.\n\nI've made it clear to my husband - the father of my 3 children (and those 3 children themselves): I have gotten up early **for the last time** to go buy lobster for Mother's Day dinner.  It's Mother's Day - all 4 of you know when it arrives along with the rest of the U.S.  There are no surprises on the calendar.  I am not shopping for my lobster and I WILL be disappointed if I don't get it.\n\n(He's never had to point out that baseball opening day is widely published in my city and that's why he has been given tickets.)\n\nIf the present is a hill you're willing to die on?
