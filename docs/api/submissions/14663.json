My nephew\u2019s negative comments usually attack her appearance, her voice, and he often says that he thinks she isn\u2019t the right one for me. I\u2019ve pulled him aside on multiple occasions to tell him that how he talks about my fianc\u00e9e bothers me, but he tells me that he\u2019s just joking. He rarely makes these \u201cjokes\u201d in front of her, but when he does my fianc\u00e9e laughs it off. She says she doesn\u2019t care about what he says because he\u2019s immature. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I went to see my family for Easter. When we were on our way home my fianc\u00e9e told me she had overheard a joke that my nephew made about her to our cousin, and she was really upset.

My mom also agrees that disinviting my nephew is too far since our wedding is so soon, and we all need to sit down and talk if there\u2019s a problem.

He\u2019s from a very open minded and accepting family. He\u2019s never had to deal with homophobia from close family members, so he doesn\u2019t know how hurtful it can be. He seems to lack a lot of empathy towards my fianc\u00e9e. Nothing she does is good enough for him. He might be jealous, or he could be bothered that his antics don\u2019t affect her. I can only think of one other time that something he said actually hurt her. Although, I think saying anything negative about my fianc\u00e9e is unacceptable, and I always try to shut it down when it happens.

But seriously, it seems like he certainly tried. Jokes are never funny when they are at the expense of another\u2019s feelings *even if the target laughs them off*. He wanted to get under her skin, and was relentless until he did. As for homophobia, elderly queer person here, I am not one to have knee jerk reactions that call people or behavior homophobic without evidence, but in my experience, I have met more than a few gay men, often young, or immature despite their actual age who for whatever reason are disparaging specifically in regards to lesbians, or more frequently, women in general. It\u2019s really, more often than not, misogynistic than homophobic.

Most gay men I've known were either cool or at the very least no more misogynistic than a typical straight men, but the ones who are especially misogynistic are really vile about it because they use their being gay as an excuse to get away with things (such as groping women, making sexual comments about them, and being homophobic to bi women and lesbians) that straight men would be censured for.", "What exactly does your brother mean he\u2019s never been \u201c\u2018nice\u2019 about your relationship so you can\u2019t say anything now?\u201d Your brother KNEW his son was bullying your partner and did NOTHING, now that your fianc\u00e9e is at a breaking point she has no right???
