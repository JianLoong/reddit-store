I\u2019ve pulled him aside on multiple occasions to tell him that how he talks about my fianc\u00e9e bothers me, but he tells me that he\u2019s just joking. He rarely makes these \u201cjokes\u201d in front of her, but when he does my fianc\u00e9e laughs it off.

He wanted to get under her skin, and was relentless until he did. As for homophobia, elderly queer person here, I am not one to have knee jerk reactions that call people or behavior homophobic without evidence, but in my experience, I have met more than a few gay men, often young, or immature despite their actual age who for whatever reason are disparaging specifically in regards to lesbians, or more frequently, women in general.

Now, your brother can accept the uninvite now, or you can let him know on the day of for peak drama and have him kicked out, but the former is the better choice for logistics sake.\n\nNTA", "NTA - his repeated comments have been addressed repeatedly and he's called them jokes.  You DID try to talk about it with him as your mom asked, which is more than I would have done, and he still is maintaining he's done nothing wrong.\n\nUninvite his ass.  If they want to take him since it's a destination and they already paid for everything, fine, but make it clear that you do not want to see a single hair on his head the entire time he's there.  He skips the wedding, the family events, the meals, all of it - he can stay in the hotel room.

You and your fiancee were willing to put up with it until that point, but the fact he did this so close to the wedding *and won't apologise* isn't your problem, and disinviting is 100% appropriate. If your brother wants to blame anyone then he can blame his son for being such a dick\n\nNTA", "My suggestion is too elope If your brother and your mom aren't going to be supportive in the celebration of your union with your partner\n\nThen you and your partner should do whatever you want Yes I know you want your family to be there at your celebration but do you really want people who don't support you to be there regardless if they're your mom or brother", "That sounds more like a reward than a punishment for an 18 year old...", "Agreed - but I'd add that in this specific instance, he chose a different thing to mock and belittle than before. He crossed a particular line for the first time. And now refuses to back down or apologize.\n\nOn those grounds alone, OP can say to her family \"this is new, so I couldn't have addressed it before. He refuses to accept this is not ok, so I can't find middle ground.\" He's an adult, he can face adult consequences like being uninvited - and if that leaves his parents out of pocket, then he can bloody well reimburse them himself.", "Do you realise that \"n-a-h\" means No Assholes Here?", "Considering he's gay I doubt that lol.", "According to the OP he's gay.I personally don't see why an 18 year old would care about not being invited to a wedding but that's just me.", "To be fair according to the OP her nephew is gay.Personally I don't think an 18 year old would care about being uninvited to a wedding.", "That's a fair compromise!\n\nYou aren't asking them to eat the cost of his travel \u2014 you're just removing your event from his trip itinerary.\n\nHe's old enough to sightsee on his own for a day. This is reasonable.\n\nNTA", "Omg I absolutely adore Venice! I got engaged there! You'll have the most amazing time, it'll be so beautiful. Congratulations, and well done for supporting your fiancee. \nYou're obviously NTA and as others have mentioned, your nephew can still go to Venice, just not to your wedding.", "You're not quite following IMO.\n\nYour mother's idea wasn't for you to reach out to him.\n\nIt was for the family to sit down together.\n\nThat's two different things. I think you should have followed not just the content of your mother's advice, but the style--tell your mother and brother you agree and ask them to set it up.", "High probability the nephew's comments are just repeats of things he's heard his parents say. Only they're better about knowing where not to say those things.", ">He says that my nephew has never been \u201cnice\u201d about my relationship, and if it was a problem it should have been addressed before now\n\nBrother is quite correct; he should have addressed the problem with his own son before now.", "NTA uninvite this person. Have a wonderful wedding!!!", "So what if they already paid I would tell them if they show up with them they won\u2019t be allowed in. Ntah", "NTA, it's your wedding.  He is an adult now and needs to understand there are consequences.\n\nYes they have paid for flights, but that just too fucking bad.", ">\tI tried reaching out to nephew to talk about it with my fianc\u00e9e, but he thinks she is being dramatic.\n\nYour brother asked you to sit down with your nephew and talk, if there\u2019s a problem.

Nephew should definitely be uninvited. \n\nNTA", ">\tHe says that my nephew has never been \u201cnice\u201d about my relationship, and if it was a problem it should have been addressed before now. \n\nYour brother just said is aware of, and OK with, his son \u201cattack[ing] her appearance, her voice, and he often says that he thinks she isn\u2019t the right one for [you].  He doesn\u2019t mind his son saying she \u201cplays house with our family because her family don\u2019t want her.\u201d \n\nYour brother is aware of this behavior, and he is OK with it.  Let that sink in. Your nephew isn\u2019t the only one who shouldn\u2019t be at the wedding. \n\nDoes your family disrespect you in other ways?  You may want to think more about your family relationships, and question if they are healthy and supportive.", "So he\u2019s uninvited! You and your fianc\u00e9e do not need to see him at your wedding, a cloud on your happiness. I wish you many joyous years.\n\nReally, it would be good to ask how someone gets to be the person for whom excuses are made and who is always defended.", "NTA OP.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke\u201d is the battle cry of homophobia.", "This difference this time is that she couldn't laugh it off as him joking about her appearance. He made a private (behind her back, thinking she wouldn't hear) joke involving her family relationship, as well as inferring that their marriage is a scam.\n\nETA - the joking about appearance is also crass, but she took it because she didn't respect his view. The marriage comment tried to get another family member involved.", "NTA. Tell your brother that he has two choices. Nephew doesn't come, or you make a huge stink and tell EVERYONE about your shitty nephew. Not just family and wedding guests, but his friends, school, work, etc. And shitty nephew still doesn't come. After all, if shitty nephew keeps saying it, and it's just a \"joke\" then no one should have a problem hearing the \"joke\".\n\nYou can even be kind and tell your brother that if picks the first choice then he can lie about why shitty nephew isn't there, as long as it doesn't implicate you or your SO.\n\nThis is a nuclear option, and could have some serious repercussions RE your bro and family. Ultimately you need to judge the level you want to go at. But no sympathy for homophobic little shits should be allowed. He is young enough that he can become a better person but the longer consequences are deferred the harder that will be. The more that sort of horseshit is normalized in your family. And the more it hurts you and your SO. Nip that shit in the bud, your brother's response is fucking malarkey.", "NTA \n\nThe nephew needs to stay home or in the hotel during the wedding.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault if they didn\u2019t insure their trip. It\u2019s their responsibility to protect their travel plans.\n\nThis is their son\u2019s fault and if they can\u2019t see that maybe they should stay behind too.", "NTA!!!! You deserve a stress free wedding, and you know you won't have one with that disrespectful brat running around.", "NTA. You didn't say he couldn't come on the trip, you just don't want him at the wedding. He can go do whatever he wants elsewhere.

This could have been handled better months ago, but the nephew didn't say what he did until last weekend.", "According to the OP the nephew is gay.", "Why do people keep on claiming homophobia when the OP has said the nephew is gay himself.Nowhes obviously a bully", "Oh yeah, this is absolutely homophobia and jealousy. The hot girl wants another woman, so he'll tear her down by any means necessary. Because nothing gets a woman hotter than being ridiculed. I can feel my bisexuality just melting away at the very idea! /s", "Let me get you a mop.", "NTA. Nope. It\u2019s not too much.", "Your wedding, your rules. If you felt the need to disinvite someone the day before the wedding, that would be your right.\n\n2 months ahead of time is plenty of time.", "NTA you need to die on this hill. He wants to be a jerk to a bride he doesn't get to to to the wedding. End of discussion \n\nCongrats!", "What a little sh**. NTA, I can't stand the \"I'm just joking excuse\" after being vulgar/rude. No you just lack self control and have deep rooted issues that need to be addressed.", "NTA.  They are correct in the fact that this should have been addressed long ago.  Obviously you speaking with him didn't stop it. You should have taken it to the next level then.  Your wedding day is for you and your bride.  Disinvite nephew.

Brother should have raised him better.", "NTA so the ticket's paid for? great, he can sit in the hotel room .  enjoy the site just not be at the wedding.  \n\nIt's another case of some jerk getting called on his behavior and saying 'I'm only joking\"  but no one is laughing. your wedding. your call.\n\nhe can come to the destination but he's not welcome at the wedding.", "NTA\n\nHomophobes don't deserve nice things and your family basically siding with him isn't a good look.", "NTA. Both Father and son have FAFO now.", "Nta ask them why you would invite someone who doesn\u2019t have anything nice to say to your wedding", "NTA.  You should definitely sit down and have that talk, and make sure it includes both the adults and your nephew.  What he has been doing for so long has never been OK - you\u2019ve just been trying to be the adults and ignoring it, until you couldn\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t). And your brother is gaslighting you - his son has NOT been \u201ctreating you nicely\u201d, and you should make that very clear in painstaking detail. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t pay for the tickets, then what you might want to consider is just keeping him from the wedding festivities.  You cannot keep him out of the country, but the invitations to the wedding events are absolutely your prerogative to rescind. Not only will that be a good consequence to his actions, it will solve the main issue - making sure that you are surrounded by only people who support and respect BOTH of you and your union. If your brother is objecting based on paying for things but is saying he understands the disrespect, this solution satisfies both - he doesn\u2019t lose out on money, and this is a justified consequence to being disrespected.", "NTA *but* your brother is correct this should have been addressed earlier and it is kind of a jerk move to wait this long saying it's fine.  Even if your fiancee kept waving it off you still could have set a boundary sooner. \n\nAll of your family, yourself included, need to sit down and ask why you've allowed this woman to be bullied for so long.\n\nBut he crossed a line and you don't have to have him there. He can still go and enjoy the vacation - just not attend the wedding.", "NTA", "The brother is right about one thing though: \u201cIf this was a problem it should have been addressed before\u201d.\n\nAgreed. And when he saw his son insulting and bullying someone, it was HIS job to deal with it before.", "Better yet, if OP is able to, they should compensate them for the cost of his ticket and call it settled. Since money seems to be the reason they are willing to allow his behavior. \n\nEdit to add additional thought.", "exactly my take", "Your fianc\u00e9e may not show it, but it seems like nephew\u2019s latest comment was the last straw. She tried being stoic and laugh it off, but his shitty comments and so-called jokes got to her alright.", "Gay dudes can also be homophobic assholes"]}
