We are having a destination wedding, so it\u2019s taken a while to plan. We had to make sure that everyone had tickets to get there on time, hotels, travel fees, etc. \n\nMy nephew (18M) has always made negative comments about my fianc\u00e9e (25F) since we got together. My nephew\u2019s negative comments usually attack her appearance, her voice, and he often says that he thinks she isn\u2019t the right one for me. I\u2019ve pulled him aside on multiple occasions to tell him that how he talks about my fianc\u00e9e bothers me, but he tells me that he\u2019s just joking. He rarely makes these \u201cjokes\u201d in front of her, but when he does my fianc\u00e9e laughs it off. She says she doesn\u2019t care about what he says because he\u2019s immature. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I went to see my family for Easter. When we were on our way home my fianc\u00e9e told me she had overheard a joke that my nephew made about her to our cousin, and she was really upset. He made a joke that my fianc\u00e9e \u201cplays house with our family because her family don\u2019t want her.\u201d This hurt my fianc\u00e9e because her family doesn\u2019t accept her, so my family took her in. She expressed to me that when he makes those kind of jokes it makes her feel like a burden on my family. We\u2019ve been dating for four years, and my family loves her. \n\nI called my brother, and I told him about what his son said. I told him that I was tired of my nephew constantly disrespecting my fianc\u00e9e and our relationship, and I didn\u2019t want him at my wedding anymore. My brother understood where I was coming from with the disrespect, but he says that disinviting his son is too far since they\u2019ve already paid for everything. He says that my nephew has never been \u201cnice\u201d about my relationship, and if it was a problem it should have been addressed before now. My mom also agrees that disinviting my nephew is too far since our wedding is so soon, and we all need to sit down and talk if there\u2019s a problem. I tried reaching out to nephew to talk about it with my fianc\u00e9e, but he thinks she is being dramatic. \n\nAITA for disinviting my nephew this close to the wedding?", "created_utc": 1681353769, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12k93tt/aita_for_disinviting_my_nephew_to_my_wedding/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can sit his petty ass in the room or somewhere else while the wedding is going on.", "NTA. He is an adult and should act like one.  Since he has not, these are the consequences.", "NTA \n\nHe was intentionally being mean and saying she was a burden and using her families homophobia against her. \n\nHe sounds homophobic himself.", "NTA\n\nHe hurt your fianc\u00e9e and this is her wedding, too. Your nephew has been warned and he still continues to disrespect her. I wouldn't want him there either. \n\n18 is old enough to know better than to be so hurtful.\n\nToo bad about them losing money. They can make their son pay them back, but it's not your problem. Only have people there who love you both and support your union.", "NTA you\u2019ve spoke with your nephew before and he continues to disrespect your fianc\u00e9e and your relationship. He\u2019s old enough to understand action/words have consequences", "NTA. I get why he keeps saying these things now\u2026 the family just enables his behaviour by defending him. They should actually be on your side about it bc he is in the wrong and it is your day and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s day so who you want there or not is your choice. \n\nThey should understand and let you decide and if I was the brother I would be ashamed for not stopping these comments the second they started. They aren\u2019t jokes they are insults saying \u201cit\u2019s a prank bro\u201d doesn\u2019t make it funny nor acceptable.", "NTA - Uninvite that nasty nephew of yours", "NTA. Your nephew has made his thoughts known. He doesn't support your pending marriage/fianc\u00e9e. Why would you waste an invite on him.

Period", "NTA- let me come instead LOL", "NTA. Your nephew sucks and you get to say who\u2019s invited.", "NTA - You have no obligation at all to have hateful, homophobic, immature little brats at your wedding.  His father thinking that his acting this way over an extended period of time implies some sort of estoppel just makes it clear your nephew is the way he is.  Frankly, I would think you were perfectly in line to refuse to have anything at all to do with him until he makes an appropriate apology for all his nasty remarks and shows actual improvements in behavior.  And going LC with the parents if they keep giving you grief should be on the table as well.\n\nI hope you and your fiance have a lovely wedding and a very happy life!", "Your brother raised a nasty little creep and sees nothing wrong with his behavior. Gross. He makes your wife feel bad. He needs to be taught a lesson.", "INFO - why can't nephew come on vacation and just not to the ceremony and reception?", "You're NTA. He clearly had a problem with your relationship, so he should not atttendyour wedding. So what if his mommy and daddy have already spent the money? He can go on the trip and sightsee while everyone else attends your wedding.", "NTA. He\u2019s a bully. Why would you want him there? Your mom and brother are also A H for pretending this behavior is even slightly okay", "If that's really how you're brother feels disinvite his ass too. This is you're day, there is no place for bigots!", "NTA. He crossed a line. If his parents want to take him on vacation, go ahead, but attending our wedding is a privilege that he lost. This is one of many opportunities for him to learn that there are consequences in healthy family relationships. Sorry you have to deal with this. Your brother doesn't want the inconvenience of dealing with his son. That's not your problem. But you should tell the nephew yourself instead of triangulating with brother. I don't know the relationship you have with all of them but he's 18 - it would be healthy for him to hear he hurt you and have an opportunity to learn.", "NTA.  Your nephew is a jerk and is utterly unrepentent about it, probably because he\u2019s been coddled his whole life by his father and grandmother.  He is 18, which is far too old to need a sit-down discussion of why his behavior is mean-spirited and inappropriate, not that he seems to be receptive anyway.", "NAH your decision is well justified, a wedding should be a happy celebration, and your nephew would\u2019ve undoubtedly pooped in the party", ">My brother understood where I was coming from with the disrespect, but he says that disinviting his son is too far since they\u2019ve already paid for everything.

You're defending your fiancee, exactly like you should be. You've talked to your nephew about this in the past. You even reached out to talk about it again.
