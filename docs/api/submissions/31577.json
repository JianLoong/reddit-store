For context, I have to do thesis work which requires analyzing data in a special program that only runs on windows computers. I managed to secure a big old windows laptop just for this purpose. Because it is quite the chunky laptop, using the trackpad is tedious and it is a LOT easier and more efficient to do work using a wireless mouse. This mouse unfortunately makes mouse clicking sounds, I\u2019m assuming like most mice do. Today I decided to go to my university\u2018s library to do some work and as always, it is completely packed. I managed to find a spot next to a girl on the quiet section. About 5 minutes after I sit down and start working I start noticing some sideways glances from her. I immediately assume it\u2019s because of my mouse clicking. My assumption seems to be confirmed when she grabs her backpack off the floor, pulls out some ear plugs or ear phones (I\u2019m not sure) and drops her bag back on the floor. I go back to my work. 5 minutes later, she leaves. \n\nAm I being totally paranoid to think she was annoyed by my clicking? I\u2019m looking around and no one else\u2019s seems to take notice of me but now I\u2019m self conscious and wondering if using a mouse in the library is a dick move.

I practically live in   libraries, lots of people use mice and/or clattery keyboards and/or leaky headphones and/or cameras and/or have phone alerts going off. Sure it's mildly irritating but ffs it's a public place not her own private soundproof booth. If you'd used a PENCIL she'd have complained about excessive scratching.", "NAH.\n\nYou did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nShe might be sensitive to the clicking noise. That's her problem to deal with but it seems like she was trying to do so. I think the worst that can be said is that she seems to have been irritated but she didn't say anything so give her a pass.", "NAH\n\nIt's fine to click a computer mouse in the library.\n\nIt's also fine to be annoyed by it and put in earplugs, then move away if they don't help.", "NTA, get a quieter mouse", "NAH - I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole because you\u2019re not talking and using the library for its intended purpose, which is usually why the quiet area of the library exists, but I won\u2019t lie when I say I would absolutely be annoyed if you sat beside me and were making a ton of clicking sounds with a mouse. It\u2019s the sound equivalent of someone repeatedly clicking their pen. Amazon has a ton of silent mouses (mice??) - invest in one.", "I feel like I'm going mad reading the NTAs - why was she TA considering she didn't say anything or ask OP to do anything differently? \n\nThis is NAH for me - you were fine to use a mouse in a library, she was fine to quietly move if she found the clicking distracting.", "NTA. I think she was just having a bad day or something. Mouse clicks aren't even that annoying tbh so not sure what her deal was.", "NTA she\u2019s in a library there\u2019s gonna be so many sounds. Typing, tapping, pages being turned. If she\u2019s that bothered she can study at home", "No judgement, just get a mouse that isn't that loud. We have silent mice at home because the clicking was killing us.", "NTA\u2026. But I have a question. Do you feel bad or guilty about the clicking mouse? If you do then get a quiet one or sit in a louder area/ not in the quiet section.", "NTA I can\u2019t believe someone would be so disturbed by this.", "I would say gently YTA\n\nWhen I was at university for comp sci, the library had specific areas for using computers and laptops in on the premise that they alone were distracting to others. \n\nFrom my own experience, if you didn't need the library specifically, I wouldn't take a spot. Most of my universities computer labs remained opened or you could ask for a room to be opened for you and sit down at any one of the 30 computer spots in the room of about 25 rooms. \n\nShould you be able to go to the library and work, yeah. But you were in a specific quiet space. The library in general is a quiet space, but areas set aside from those again may have more restrictions e.g. no computers/phones etc... \n\nCan't know all the details or restrictions on the space you were in, but its something to be aware of, are there restrictions on computers and devices where you sat. Was there a better zone for you or designated area. Was there an alternative option to the library(if you didn't need specific library materials)", "Yta. If its a quiet section.....you dont make noise. Like imagine someone next to you tapping thier pencil against the desk making tapping noises every few seconds.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
