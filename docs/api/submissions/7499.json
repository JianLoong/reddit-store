A part of me feels the same way. I'm 29f and I've been married to my husband Jack for 10 years. \n\n6 months ago Jack got in to a really bad car accident. He was in a coma for almost 5 weeks and currently has PT 4 times a week, as well as a visiting nurse who comes twice a week. I've been working 60+ hours a week, while 7 months pregnant (I found out I was pregnant a week after his accident), and I keep coming up shorter and shorter every single month for rent because not only did they up the rent by $400 but Jacks medical bills are getting more expensive as well. I can't afford anything anymore. To a point where I qualified for EBT just last week. But last month I was served an eviction notice. I knew it was coming. I had been paying what I could ($500 here, $700 there) but the landlord ultimately decided that it \"hardly covered a portion of the rent\" and had me served. I was able to get a 30 day extension by the court house because of my husband's condition so I have now 27 days to find somewhere else for us to live. \n\nJacks sister, my SIL (46f) offered us a room. She has 3 extra rooms. One is her daughters play room and the other one is her office. The 3rd bedroom is downstairs, right in front of the front door and next to the bathroom so it was honestly perfect and I was so stupidly excited that I won't have to bring my disabled husband to a homeless shelter (we have no other option). I thanked her profusely (this was a week ago) and started packing our stuff on my down time. Well, she texted me this morning and said she changed her mind. Said that her and my husband's 13yo niece wanted her own room for when she came to visit (twice a month) and she gave her the room instead. As an alternative she started sending me FB ads for housing that was just as expensive as what we are paying now, knowing I can't only not afford it but also don't have money AT ALL for a down payment. I have $50 to my name. The savings is depleted. I just didn't answer her because it destroyed me. \n\nWell she texted again just a minute ago and said \"You can't be pissed at me. It's my house.\" In the midst of feeling incredibly hurt, panicked and everything else I was feeling, I texted back and said \"I truly cannot see myself having any contact whatsoever with you for awhile.\" At which point she said I was childish, so I doubled down and said \"Scratch that, I WONT be having contact with you anymore.\" I'm being told I'm in the wrong by MIL, who lives in a nursing home.

You had a good solution to your immediate problem, but it fell through. So it is normal to feel frustrated, betrayed, upset, even angry. And when you express that you get further rebuffed and dismissed by the person who you thought could help. She is your sister in law, so your husband's sibling. You are also in the midst of an extremely stressful time. I think all your feelings are justified.", "NAH.... she is in the right to withdraw her offer but you are equally right to be upset about this. From what you said you weren't unhinged, and saying you don't want contact (at least for a while) understandable. Sorry you're in such a horrible situation....", "NTA but contact the social worker at the hospital and see if they can refer you to help", "NTA, what an awful person she is.", "nta \nthis sucks\ni'm so sorry", "I think you need to temporarily block SIL so you can focus 100%of your attention on your housing issue.

I had gone to her house last week crying because I was just over emotional and needed someone to talk to and that's when she flat out offered me the room.

She can call aps and cps now that you don't have stable housing. I feel like she planned this. I'm not sure what her end game would be (custody of your child? Control over her brother?) Maybe I've just met too many shitty underhanded people but I smell something fishy. Watch out.", "Not sure what country but if you're in the US. If you're husband is now disabled you should qualify for Medicaid for him. Is it possible can go to a rehab facility for a few months? Apply for every financial aid the hospital etc has and you may be able to back date those bills as well. It will be easier to find a program for you and your baby as more shelters cater to women.", "NTA. Your SIL is a huge one though for taking back her offer. I\u2019m appalled she\u2019s willing to let her you and her brother be homeless for a someone who\u2019d only be there part time at most. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the states, try calling your district\u2019s state rep\u2019s office & explain your situation. They will help put you in contact with agencies and resources to either help you stay where you are or help you find new housing and financial assistance, and may even expedite things for you. I\u2019ve been in similar straits, and  have gotten help this way. \nGood luck, and keep in mind your situation is temporary.

I would talk to your husband\u2019s doctors.  They may at least be able to get him in a residential rehab facility for a while so his care does not get discontinued.  Also look into family shelters in your area.  Some have placements for families temporarily.", "NTA\n\nYou have enough going on without having to play games", "NTA. What's wrong with some families? I can't even honestly call people like this \"family\". If your brother is disabled, his wife is pregnant, and they're on their way to a homeless shelter, you don't give the extra room to a spoiled teenager for twice a month. You move them in and protect them. And BTW, I hope you have a lawyer, unless your husband was undeniably in the wrong (drunk driving, etc), someone has to pay up. Good luck, and a pox on your SIL.", "It takes a criminally long time to qualify for disability in the US. Years.", "Nope, letting your disabled brother and pregnant SIL become homeless when you have multiple extra rooms is peak asshole.", "A less out there explanation is that she offered on the spot and then had cold feet once talked to her husband (who also gets a say) and/or she realized what it would actually feel like to add a couple to the household with financial issues, health issues and a baby on the way.  Shitty thing to do to someone all around. For my part, even if I\u2019d gotten cold feet, I\u2019d have kept my word given the severity of the circumstances.", "This is probably the more likely explanation, but is still so shitty. \n\nI went through something similar: I was 6 months pregnant and I got fired from my job (I took a vacation that had been approved and then they changed it to denied and assigned me shifts after the vacation had started). That same week my landlord gave us notice that they were selling and at the time were only legally required to give a month\u2019s notice. I was desperate and a pregnant friend who had just bought a house offered to let me move in. \n\nTwo weeks later when I called her to finalize a move in date, she said she had thought about it, and decided that two babies in a house would be too much. I was so upset, and she also told me I couldn\u2019t be upset because it was her house and she had her pregnancy to think about, and that I should be a more sympathetic friend. And I told her I didn\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth left to give a shit about her as I now had only a week to find a place to live since she had just wasted 2 weeks of my time with an offer that I never asked for.", "NTA. She reneged on an agreement with you, her immediate family in desperate need, for the sake of a child's occasional visits. I hope she... well, I hope something really unfortunate happens to her. Karma is a b*tch. \n\nGood luck with this situation. I'm so sorry it's gotten so bad for you.", "Screw your sister in law. NTA. If your husband has a case worker let them know your situation. Try the red cross, catholic charity, or even your city to see if they have any low income housing.  Good luck!", "NTA, not sure what you thought \"entitled\" part was. She offered you a room when in need. Then she pulled the offer for a stupid reason (relative to your needs) and was confused why that pissed you off.", "NTA Time to set up a crowdfunding site. You are drowning here. Start calling all friends and family for help. No time to be proud. You need help, charity and whatever else it takes to get you housed in time for baby. If you go homeless will you qualify for government housing help? If in US your local councilor or congressperson\u2019s office may be able to help. Or something like Catholic Charities. Wishing you the very best of luck.", "NTA. Something similar happened between my in laws and I. You have every right to distance yourself.", "I am so sorry for your situation, you sil sounds heartless. NTA.", "NTA contact you local county.. they sometimes have down payment assistance and rent assistance. Also look into funding for the baby needs ( car seat, clothes , etc).", "NTA. Let her know that you wouldn\u2019t be mad had she said no in the first place because, yes, it is her house. You\u2019re mad that she went back on her word. And you absolutely have every right to be mad about that.", "NTA she offered a room and then quickly rescinded.  She should have thought it through prior to offering.  It was insensitive to send housing market ads and completely oblivious to the situation of why you are asking to move in with her.  It is her house yes but she can have some tact.", "NTA she knew exactly what she was gonna do from the jump. Takes a special kind of A H to do something like this. I truly hope you get it figured out. Good luck.", "NTA she promised you a room. She took it back and now wants you to not be mad at her? She's lucky she didn't slander you to the world. Cut contact, it will do nothing to help you while you actually figure out your next steps.", "nta", "NTA. That was so cruel of her and almost seems deliberate to be honest. Who actually gives a visiting 13 year old her own whole room for two visits a month while her disabled brother and pregnant SIL are in a very precarious spot?? Did that move give her some sense of power knowing she could put you on the streets? She actually should win the biggest giant gaping AH award for all of 2023 for that move. I hope everything works out for you guys.", "NTA - Promising assistance and then reneging and gaslighting you is the epitome of a backhand. She didn't do you any favors, she actually caused you to waste time. That's a very toxic trait to have. Going no contact makes sense. \n\n  \nOf all spectrums of \"flakes\" someone who offers help then rescinds it without cause on your part, is the worst sort of flake. It's a waste of time and a headache to deal with.", "Man, she sounds awful. The whole tone is just off, I would cut contact as well. She promises you a room,  let's you get all excited,  then she \"changes\" her mind. You would think if she valued the friendship, it would be at least a less callous denial. It's her home, but it's your relationship with her. You don't have to have room in your heart for her either. She clearly does not have a heart to care about you.  Nta", "NAH Whilst your SIL is technically correct, I can\u2019t imagine lacking so much compassion to allow her sick brother to come from hospital to a homeless shelter. All I can say is that you two must have done something to really hurt her or piss her off. Find out what.", "Exactly, just block both SIL and MIL and focus on your own life rn.", "I am replying directly to your comment OP so hopefully you see this sooner. Please look up and contact your local housing authority to get put on a list, homeless people are normally prioritize over people who have a home but can't afford it.", "It depends on the situation. My dad had a brain aneurysm rupture and stroke and my mom got the Medicaid very quickly. He did not get disability per se but there are many ways to get your insurance paid for. If she qualifies for EBT, she probably qualifies for healthcare for her and baby. It's possible for him as well. Also most healthcare institutions have their own financial aid and will help you get Medicaid as well. We make decent in money and I qualified for 50% off hospital fees for having my baby.", "True \u2014 however, if you are in a nursing home that accepts Medicaid, they cannot throw you out if you have applied for Medicaid and are anywhere in the application cycle. I work in geriatrics and I see this a lot.", "they can't take your child away for being homeless", "He's not in a nursing home now though. He's home with home-care services.

Go NC and do your best \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA also not entitled at all, there is a difference between expecting people to do things for you and expecting people to follow thru on something they specifically promised. going NC with someone who agreed to house you then changed their mind last minute leaving you homeless is perfectly reasonable... also your MIL backing your SIL when she left your MIL's son homeless while disabled just blows my mind", "NTA. I am sorry this happening to you. Hopefully things turn around fast!", "NTA, does your MIL want y'all to live on the street?", "NTA block her. I hope you and hubby manage to land someplace safe.", "NTA.

I don\u2019t believe in god but I am so heavily praying something good happens for you and your husband. The stress and frustration that you must be feeling right now must be absolutely insane. I am so sorry this is happening to you. NTA whatsoever, what she did was straight up vile and she knows it. So that\u2019s why she\u2019s trying to make you out to be the bad guy so she stops feeling guilty. I would make sure she wouldn\u2019t be able to tell if I was dead or alive from this point onward", "It sounds like she offered before checking with her husband and he said no. You are being evicted right, so maybe just squat there until you find a solution.", "NTA. Not entitled at all. I can't believe she would give the room to a 13 year old over her disabled brother.", "NTA. She's taking advantage of your vulnerability and mental state right now to gaslight you into thinking that she's your only option. She's not. Forget about her and focus on yourself and your loved ones right now. \n\nI'm sorry you feel so close to the end of your rope right now, but you are definitely going to survive this and everything is going to be alright. My recommendation is to start a GoFundMe and ask for donations just to get you through this, and perhaps have a little more to secure something solid of yours and your family's own for the long term.\n\nIt's not much, but I wish you all the best and good luck. You can do this.", "NTA. Does she realise you can be pissed at her because she is making you homeless?", "NTA - her dangling her house as an option and then backing out was a dick move. To top it off it sounds like she is reneging to help a family member with a want, not a need. If she gives you anymore grief about being upset you can send her this post and tell her the internet thinks she\u2019s an AH too.", "NTA.  I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this. If you are getting the therapy and nursing services through a US home health agency, they should have a social worker. Please start talking to that person ASAP to help with housing assistance.

She promised you something and then took it back and had the audacity to feel entitled to you not being upset. She doesn\u2019t get to choose YOUR feelings just because it\u2019s her house. She reneged on a promise and is playing with both you and your husband\u2019s well being and emotions.

It not as easy as you suggest. Medicare takes two years to gain eligibility for disability purposes.", "I\u2019m sorry but what? People like you who think squatting after being given valid notice for eviction is what gives some renters a bad name. She has no entitlement to be in that home. She was served properly for failing to pay rent and was already granted an extension. She needs to start reaching out to resources where she lives to get housed. Maybe with a disabled husband and her pregnancy, she can be prioritised but it\u2019s not up to her landlord to keep housing her on his own dime.", "True, but I was trying to see if that was even an option.

She had a TBI, lacerated liver, broken vertebre and collarbone among other things.\n\nI didn't even have to apply for medicaid and food stamps. It was automatically done for her due to her diagnoses. I did have to apply to be her carer.  I left a job and they took care of her while she recovered.

Probably she offered in the moment because, well that's what she should do.

I'm not sure if more happened between you than you're sharing or if she was being pressured by family to take you in and used the neice as an excuse to get out of it.\n\nJust remember that her decision not to take you in didn't put you in this situation. Agreeing to it and then backing out was definitely hurtful and probably wasted time you could have used to figure out other options, but you would be in the same situation right now if she had said no from the beginning.\n\nYou're legitimately angry at her, but most of what you're feeling right now is fear and frustration from the situation she promised to help you out of.

Fuck landlords, especially your former one. I don\u2019t know how they sleep at night.

After all you and your husband are dealing with, his sister's actions were incredibly petty and cruel. To tell you that you were being childish was an insane attempt at gaslighting you.

Also, if you're in a city, Catholic Charities and Jewish Family Services have different programs and you don't have to belong to those religions to get help.

Blast her on social media if you can.  And she values a child's playroom than her own Brother at the worst time of his life.
