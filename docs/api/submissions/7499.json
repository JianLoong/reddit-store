A part of me feels the same way. I'm 29f and I've been married to my husband Jack for 10 years. \n\n6 months ago Jack got in to a really bad car accident. He was in a coma for almost 5 weeks and currently has PT 4 times a week, as well as a visiting nurse who comes twice a week. I've been working 60+ hours a week, while 7 months pregnant (I found out I was pregnant a week after his accident), and I keep coming up shorter and shorter every single month for rent because not only did they up the rent by $400 but Jacks medical bills are getting more expensive as well. I can't afford anything anymore. To a point where I qualified for EBT just last week. But last month I was served an eviction notice. I knew it was coming. I had been paying what I could ($500 here, $700 there) but the landlord ultimately decided that it \"hardly covered a portion of the rent\" and had me served. I was able to get a 30 day extension by the court house because of my husband's condition so I have now 27 days to find somewhere else for us to live. \n\nJacks sister, my SIL (46f) offered us a room. She has 3 extra rooms. One is her daughters play room and the other one is her office. The 3rd bedroom is downstairs, right in front of the front door and next to the bathroom so it was honestly perfect and I was so stupidly excited that I won't have to bring my disabled husband to a homeless shelter (we have no other option). I thanked her profusely (this was a week ago) and started packing our stuff on my down time. Well, she texted me this morning and said she changed her mind. Said that her and my husband's 13yo niece wanted her own room for when she came to visit (twice a month) and she gave her the room instead. As an alternative she started sending me FB ads for housing that was just as expensive as what we are paying now, knowing I can't only not afford it but also don't have money AT ALL for a down payment. I have $50 to my name. The savings is depleted. I just didn't answer her because it destroyed me. \n\nWell she texted again just a minute ago and said \"You can't be pissed at me. It's my house.\" In the midst of feeling incredibly hurt, panicked and everything else I was feeling, I texted back and said \"I truly cannot see myself having any contact whatsoever with you for awhile.\" At which point she said I was childish, so I doubled down and said \"Scratch that, I WONT be having contact with you anymore.\" I'm being told I'm in the wrong by MIL, who lives in a nursing home.

She offered which she didn't need to, but I was still an offer that she's now backing down from. The circumstances of the wreck and the pregnancy have given you very few choices and pulling the rug from underneath you after her promise isn't right.", "NTA. We all know \"but faaaamily\" gets used as a bullshit reason for all kinds of things. But you know what? Unless there is some *major* history between Jack and SIL, this is a time when she deserves a big old heap of shame for how she's treating her own brother. I can't imagine sending a disabled sibling to a homeless shelter, especially if there's a room in the house that accommodates his needs. \n\nNo one ever forgets how people treated them at their lowest moments.", "NTA. \n\nTechnically, she's right and it is her house, but she's also \u00e0 huge asshole and all for a teenager Who will come twice \u00e0 month...", "NTA. I would tell her you\u2019re seconds away from living on the streets and you can\u2019t afford anything right now. Does she know how broke you are and that\u2019s you\u2019re pregnant? Sounds like an awful SIL.

Tell your MIL to mind her own business or you won't be contacting her either.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry about your husband's accident. I hope he's able to recover fully as soon as possible. I also hope that things become easier for you on the finances and housing fronts, I can't imagine the tough time you're having at the moment.\n\nI think your reaction to all this is very understandable. It's true that you're not entitled to your SIL's room, but I don't think you're acting entitled. You were offered help at a difficult time, then that help was taken away from you. Technically your SIL had every right to do that, but I think it's very poor form on her part.\n\nI hope that you're able to find somewhere suitable soon, and that your baby arrives safe and healthy. All the best!", "NTA, because she did lead you on only to screw you over for which I'm sorry.  It is her house so sadly it's her choice, and there is nothing you can do about it.  I am just shocked that she would rather leave her brother who is suffering from a medical emergency, and pregnant SIL to live in a shelter to give a room to a person who visits twice a month.  Have you contacted social services yet for options?  Can your family help you in any way?  I really am sorry for your struggles.\n\nAH question, but who's fault was the accident?  If it wasn't your husband's fault, the other party's insurance company is responsible for the medical bills incurred due to the accident.", "NTA\n\nIt's her house yes, but her brother is recovering from a serious injury and you are pregnant and so you feeling hurt that she understood that but took away that option on a whim.\n\nSee if you can get friends and family to help or do a gofundme.\n\nAlso it's time to be an asshole and not move out and squat through the eviction. Odds are high that you'll be able to extend the time another month or more. Your credit and housing records are already shot to hell so there's unlikely to be other easy housing options for you, so unfortunately be an asshole and try to stretch the time.", "Wow I can't believe his sister and mother treat him so terribly.", "NTA \n\nDial 211, First Call for Help, if you are in the US. It's a resource hotline that will have multiple resources that can help you. You're not entitled at all. Good luck.", "Omg...

You had a good solution to your immediate problem, but it fell through. So it is normal to feel frustrated, betrayed, upset, even angry. And when you express that you get further rebuffed and dismissed by the person who you thought could help. She is your sister in law, so your husband's sibling. You are also in the midst of an extremely stressful time. I think all your feelings are justified.", "NAH.... she is in the right to withdraw her offer but you are equally right to be upset about this. From what you said you weren't unhinged, and saying you don't want contact (at least for a while) understandable. Sorry you're in such a horrible situation....", "NTA but contact the social worker at the hospital and see if they can refer you to help", "NTA, what an awful person she is.", "nta \nthis sucks\ni'm so sorry", "I think you need to temporarily block SIL so you can focus 100%of your attention on your housing issue. She's using your situation to centre herself in drama and you have bigger things to focus on with not a lot of time to find solutions. NTA", "Yes, she knows all of that because her and I were incredibly close. I had gone to her house last week crying because I was just over emotional and needed someone to talk to and that's when she flat out offered me the room. She even brought me to the room and started working out plans of how we could arrange it to fit my husband's medical equipment.", "Ok I'm an extremely paranoid person but it sounds to me like she is setting you up. She can call aps and cps now that you don't have stable housing. I feel like she planned this. I'm not sure what her end game would be (custody of your child? Control over her brother?) Maybe I've just met too many shitty underhanded people but I smell something fishy. Watch out.", "Not sure what country but if you're in the US. If you're husband is now disabled you should qualify for Medicaid for him. Is it possible can go to a rehab facility for a few months? Apply for every financial aid the hospital etc has and you may be able to back date those bills as well. It will be easier to find a program for you and your baby as more shelters cater to women.", "NTA. Your SIL is a huge one though for taking back her offer. I\u2019m appalled she\u2019s willing to let her you and her brother be homeless for a someone who\u2019d only be there part time at most. \n\nIf you\u2019re in the states, try calling your district\u2019s state rep\u2019s office & explain your situation. They will help put you in contact with agencies and resources to either help you stay where you are or help you find new housing and financial assistance, and may even expedite things for you. I\u2019ve been in similar straits, and  have gotten help this way. \nGood luck, and keep in mind your situation is temporary. It\u2019s dark now, but trust that things will get better and you\u2019ll be alright in the end.", " BTA. The niece is just an excuse. She just didn\u2019t want you there. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with a baby.", "NTA yes it is her house and she is entitled to use it as she wishes but that was an AH move both taking it away at the last minute & how she responded afterwards. Best of luck to you", "NTA. What she did was cruel. I don\u2019t blame you for your reaction. I wish you and your husband the best of luck.", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry OP and you SIL & MIL & niece and all the rest of them are GARBAGE", "Your SIL is TA. They could have changed the playroom to a bedroom.  A child will play anywhere. What a shit thing to do.", "NTA - You are in real need and she turned her back on you because a niece wants a room 2 days out of 30. That's insane to me!", "NTA.  I would talk to your husband\u2019s doctors.  They may at least be able to get him in a residential rehab facility for a while so his care does not get discontinued.  Also look into family shelters in your area.  Some have placements for families temporarily.", "NTA\n\nYou have enough going on without having to play games", "NTA. What's wrong with some families? I can't even honestly call people like this \"family\". If your brother is disabled, his wife is pregnant, and they're on their way to a homeless shelter, you don't give the extra room to a spoiled teenager for twice a month. You move them in and protect them. And BTW, I hope you have a lawyer, unless your husband was undeniably in the wrong (drunk driving, etc), someone has to pay up. Good luck, and a pox on your SIL.", "It takes a criminally long time to qualify for disability in the US. Years.", "Nope, letting your disabled brother and pregnant SIL become homeless when you have multiple extra rooms is peak asshole.", "A less out there explanation is that she offered on the spot and then had cold feet once talked to her husband (who also gets a say) and/or she realized what it would actually feel like to add a couple to the household with financial issues, health issues and a baby on the way.  Shitty thing to do to someone all around. For my part, even if I\u2019d gotten cold feet, I\u2019d have kept my word given the severity of the circumstances.", "This is probably the more likely explanation, but is still so shitty. \n\nI went through something similar: I was 6 months pregnant and I got fired from my job (I took a vacation that had been approved and then they changed it to denied and assigned me shifts after the vacation had started). That same week my landlord gave us notice that they were selling and at the time were only legally required to give a month\u2019s notice. I was desperate and a pregnant friend who had just bought a house offered to let me move in. \n\nTwo weeks later when I called her to finalize a move in date, she said she had thought about it, and decided that two babies in a house would be too much. I was so upset, and she also told me I couldn\u2019t be upset because it was her house and she had her pregnancy to think about, and that I should be a more sympathetic friend. And I told her I didn\u2019t have the emotional bandwidth left to give a shit about her as I now had only a week to find a place to live since she had just wasted 2 weeks of my time with an offer that I never asked for."]}
