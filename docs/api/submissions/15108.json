This is a very messy situation.\n\nYWBTA if in the midst of this, you have completely severed the connection between your sister and your son for your own ego. Like it or not, fair or not, your kid thinks of your sister as his primary caregiver. Completely severing this tie between them so that YOU can replace your sister isn't going to take away the bond between him and his aunt, it's only going to create a trauma that he won't have words for. She should still be a part of his life in some capacity if she is willing to be.\n\nThis is a mess. Family therapy or some kind of external mediator would probably help here.

I work in child welfare, reunification is the main goal we work towards whenever possible.

I\u2019m happy for you and proud of you and your husbands journey through this together!! \n\nThat being said, since everyone backed your sister on forcing you to fight for custody and prove your fitness, everyone should agree with the judge\u2019s ruling that you having custody is best for your child. They don\u2019t have any right to be upset with you, and they are assholes for making you feel bad for proving yourself, like they wanted, and earning full custody. You EARNED this, the judge agrees that this is best for your child, and everyone should see that and accept the outcome of the custody case. You should be proud of yourself for how far you\u2019ve come and everyone else should be proud of you as well. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about what they think is best for your child, because the judge made that decision with aaaaallll of the information they thought proved you were an unfit mother, this is about them being pissed and jealous that they lost. What does your family have against you that they want to punish you like this? They should be overjoyed that you\u2019re better and willing and capable to raise your own child.

Given the mental health history here, and the fact that you essentially abandoned an infant, it seems *incredibly important* to ensure that you are stable enough to care for an infant before turning over care.\n\nYour sister cannot call your psychiatrist and ask that question due to medical privacy laws. So the courts are the only possible arbiter in this situation to ensure your child's safety.\n\nYou being angry that your sister did due diligence to ensure the safety of your child is UNREASONABLE. Your sister took over care of your infant when you were not able to. The only emotion you should be feeling towards her right now is gratitude. Instead, this post reeks of entitlement.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIs this baby your daughter or your son?\n\nIf you are going to make up stories on the internet you need to be consistent in order to get people to believe you.", "YTA\n\nWhat did ***your doctors*** say about you taking back your child?\n\nJust because you miss him and want him back, doesn't mean you're ready and able to provide care.\n\nAlso, why wasn't your husband, her father, caring for him?  Even if he had to work, daycare when your husband was working, and working together to care for your child when your husband wasn't working would have provided more consistency of care.\n\nIn the end, what matters is not what you want, or how many chances you deserve.  What matters is the best interests of the child.\n\nYou say your child is 10 months now, mid-April.  You wanted her back in Sept., at which point she would have been 3 months old.  You had your breakdown at 2 months old, which would be August.\n\nSo, over the course of one month, you realized you had PPD, were hospitalized for 2 weeks, spent more time adjusting your meds, talked about giving custody to your sister, and then wanted her back.\n\nThat is one heck of a roller coaster.\n\nI do not blame your sister for being reluctant to return your child at that time.  You hadn't been feeling better for long enough to show that you're really stabilized.\n\nAnd your child had already gone through one major change in their life, being abruptly moved from your care to your sister's care.  You weren't proposing a gradual takeover of care, carefully supervised by your doctors to make sure you were okay, you just wanted your child back, another abrupt disruption just as she was adapting to your sister.\n\nAnd if it proved to be overwhelming, again, and you had another breakdown, would your child wind up back with your sister?  Your child is not a hot potato to be tossed back and forth depending on how your feel.\n\nFrom what you've written, it's all about you, and how you feel, and not about what your doctors think is appropriate for your condition, or about stability and the best interests of your child.", "NAH. You were sick and got appropriate help, but your sister was correct to be concerned that things had improved enough, given the nature of your condition and previous things you had said. PPD is a very serious condition that threatens not only you but the baby, and needs very close monitoring to ensure you don't regress. However, it is also a condition that you can recover from, with treatment and monitoring. Since you now know you are susceptible to this, make sure you have a plan for keeping yourself healthy, and a backup for how you will protect your son's best interests if you do regress. By getting help in the first place, you showed that you are capable of putting his interests first - placing him with your sister was absolutely appropriate at the time, and your doctors and the courts agree that bringing him home is appropriate now.\n\nBest of luck with your ongoing recovery.", "NAH. This sounds like an incredibly difficult situation for you, your son, AND your sister, but from what you've said here, it sounds like everyone has been doing their best. \n\nI'm glad that you reached out and got the help you needed. I'm glad that your sister was able to take care of him. I'm glad you're doing better. I'm glad your sister cared enough to be careful about where your son goes. I'm glad your son is back home with you now. \n\nAnd yet, none of these wonderful things cancel out how difficult and messy the situation is. You've been through hell and are still working on putting your life back together. Your sister has spent a year caring for and bonding with a baby you told her might be hers forever - and is now adjusting to living without that baby. And your son has experienced tremendous upheaval in his life with absolutely no way to understand what these changes are or why.   None of you are the AH, but all of you are hurting. \n\nI hope things get easier for you and your family soon. In the meantime, please be as kind to each other as you can.", "Is sister angry you got him back? Is she still fighting or trying to regain custody from you?\n\nIf not then I'd say NAH. You had a medical condition. You did what you had to to keep him safe while you got the help you needed. Sister did what she felt she had to do to make sure he would be safe back in your care. I would probably do the same, honestly. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if something bad happened to my nephew and I didn't do everything in my power to prevent it. \n\nAs long as everyone had the baby's best interest at heart, this went exactly how it needed to go and I think thanking your sister for taking care of him and being so careful (if you haven't already that is) might do some good in reassuring the rest of the family that you're doing better.", "NAH", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your family could use some education on what post partum depression is. Good for you and your husband for getting help and getting better.", "NTA the fact you notices something was not right and you and your husband got help is commendable.

You made a hard decision and it worked out for you and for your son.\n\nYour sister made the desicion to let professionals decide if you are fit for being a mom. You proved yourself and them that you are! And got your baby back.\n\nThere are sooo many parents out there who have their own kids and do not have to proof themselfes. You had to and did it! You should be proud of overcoming depression and being mature enough to know whats best for your child.\n\nIf your sister isn't mad at you for getting your kid back, then she did it also solely for him and is in the right too. If she is mad know, than she is an a******.\n\nAnd all the family members that think you should just give up your kid, because of a medical condition, they can fuck off! Millions of women suffer from post partum and not every one of them is able to speak out loud, get help and overcome it like you did! You made everything right. Would they like to take away every child of a mom with depression or other medical conditions that try to get help? That is ridiculous.\n\nTell them if they have the audacity to shame you again, they can fuck off and never see you or your baby again. \n\nCongrats on doing this and i hope you will always have this lovely relationship with your husband, where you support each other and get through everything together!\n\nNAH", "NTA - you had a known medical condition and made the right call to put your child in a place of supposed safety until you were better.
