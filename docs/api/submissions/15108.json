{"id": 15108, "submission_id": "12qu8q3", "title": "AITA for fighting to get my son back after my sister tried to get full custody of him?", "selftext": "So i (f30) had my son (m10m) last year . It was a really hard pregnancy and about two months after he was born, I had starting having bad thoughts and realized I wasn't okay. I spoke with my husband (31m) about it and he immediately called out of work and took me to the hospital where I learned I had postpartum depression and I spent about 2 weeks there getting my meds figured out. \n When I got out of the hospital I still didn't feel like I was okay enough to give my son the love and support a newborn needs. So I contacted my sister (28f) who offered to take my son and care for her temporarily while I focused on getting better and waiting for my meds to start working properly. I will admit during this time I was not myself and talked to her about her permanently keeping my son and possibly leaving my husband since he didn't want to give my son up. But me and my husband talked through it and by September, october I was feeling so much better and was really starting to miss my baby boy. We told my sister we were coming to get him and told her a date a few weeks out (just to make sure I was truly doing well) and my sister took out emergency custody of my son using my hospital stay and what I was saying to her about not wanting him while I was out of my mind.  She told me it was my job to prove to a judge that i was a fit mother. After months of fighting in court we finally got our son back in January but I feel like certain people on my side of the family possibly think I'm in the wrong and that I should of just let her keep my son. I know I said messed up things and I can understand they feel like maybe she would have been a better parent but that's my baby and I love him and he's doing so good and getting so big. I just don't understand how they could be upset with me AITA\n\n\n\nEdit to answer some questions \nA lot of people are asking why my husband didn't get immediate custody. It was an emergency order based only on the fact that I was a threat to my son. It was given immediately with zero regards to if my husband was fit or not. I was in the house, I was the danger, that's all they needed. \n\nOnce the order was granted it had to go through the court system we had an emergency hearing within a few days since it was an emergency matter and she had proof her claims were legitimate with why i was hospitalized and what I was saying so they extended the temp order that he stays with her until we could get a court date because i live in the house that my husband lives in. That date kept getting pushed back and the order extended for months.\n\nEither my husband or I would have had to completely move out of the house and my husband quit his job(they wouldn't approve his temporary leave and threatened to fire him when he asked for a few weeks off) until the court date , for our son to return to our home sooner. It was an impossible situation and thank you all for your comments it's really helping me get some perspective.", "created_utc": 1681834630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qu8q3/aita_for_fighting_to_get_my_son_back_after_my/", "score": 1912, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Talk with a lawyer about your legal options and what work you need to do to (e.g., counseling, parenting classes, psychiatry, etc.).

You are not TA for taking the steps required to get custody of your kid back. This is a very messy situation.\n\nYWBTA if in the midst of this, you have completely severed the connection between your sister and your son for your own ego. Like it or not, fair or not, your kid thinks of your sister as his primary caregiver. Completely severing this tie between them so that YOU can replace your sister isn't going to take away the bond between him and his aunt, it's only going to create a trauma that he won't have words for. She should still be a part of his life in some capacity if she is willing to be.\n\nThis is a mess. Family therapy or some kind of external mediator would probably help here.

I get her wanting to be sure the baby would be safe with you, but there are better ways to do that (a conversation?!) Than an emergency court order.", "NTA. I work in child welfare, reunification is the main goal we work towards whenever possible. Good on you for doing what you needed to to provide a safe loving home for your child and putting your child somewhere that care could be provided when you couldn't. Your sister is a major AH as well as anyone else who says otherwise.", "NTA. You\u2019re sister was right, it was on you to prove to the court that you were a fit mother to get your child back after a very difficult time, and congratulations!!! the court decided that you were working in your child\u2019s best interest and fit to have full custody. I\u2019m happy for you and proud of you and your husbands journey through this together!! \n\nThat being said, since everyone backed your sister on forcing you to fight for custody and prove your fitness, everyone should agree with the judge\u2019s ruling that you having custody is best for your child. They don\u2019t have any right to be upset with you, and they are assholes for making you feel bad for proving yourself, like they wanted, and earning full custody. You EARNED this, the judge agrees that this is best for your child, and everyone should see that and accept the outcome of the custody case. You should be proud of yourself for how far you\u2019ve come and everyone else should be proud of you as well. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about what they think is best for your child, because the judge made that decision with aaaaallll of the information they thought proved you were an unfit mother, this is about them being pissed and jealous that they lost. What does your family have against you that they want to punish you like this? They should be overjoyed that you\u2019re better and willing and capable to raise your own child.

This is betrayal.", ">She told me it was my job to prove to a judge that i was a fit mother.\n\nI'm not sure how you perceive that to be an unreasonable statement? Given the mental health history here, and the fact that you essentially abandoned an infant, it seems *incredibly important* to ensure that you are stable enough to care for an infant before turning over care.\n\nYour sister cannot call your psychiatrist and ask that question due to medical privacy laws. So the courts are the only possible arbiter in this situation to ensure your child's safety.\n\nYou being angry that your sister did due diligence to ensure the safety of your child is UNREASONABLE. Your sister took over care of your infant when you were not able to. The only emotion you should be feeling towards her right now is gratitude. Instead, this post reeks of entitlement.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIs this baby your daughter or your son?\n\nIf you are going to make up stories on the internet you need to be consistent in order to get people to believe you.", "YTA\n\nWhat did ***your doctors*** say about you taking back your child?\n\nJust because you miss him and want him back, doesn't mean you're ready and able to provide care.\n\nAlso, why wasn't your husband, her father, caring for him?  Even if he had to work, daycare when your husband was working, and working together to care for your child when your husband wasn't working would have provided more consistency of care.\n\nIn the end, what matters is not what you want, or how many chances you deserve.  What matters is the best interests of the child.\n\nYou say your child is 10 months now, mid-April.  You wanted her back in Sept., at which point she would have been 3 months old.  You had your breakdown at 2 months old, which would be August.\n\nSo, over the course of one month, you realized you had PPD, were hospitalized for 2 weeks, spent more time adjusting your meds, talked about giving custody to your sister, and then wanted her back.\n\nThat is one heck of a roller coaster.\n\nI do not blame your sister for being reluctant to return your child at that time.  You hadn't been feeling better for long enough to show that you're really stabilized.\n\nAnd your child had already gone through one major change in their life, being abruptly moved from your care to your sister's care.  You weren't proposing a gradual takeover of care, carefully supervised by your doctors to make sure you were okay, you just wanted your child back, another abrupt disruption just as she was adapting to your sister.\n\nAnd if it proved to be overwhelming, again, and you had another breakdown, would your child wind up back with your sister?  Your child is not a hot potato to be tossed back and forth depending on how your feel.\n\nFrom what you've written, it's all about you, and how you feel, and not about what your doctors think is appropriate for your condition, or about stability and the best interests of your child.", "NAH. You were sick and got appropriate help, but your sister was correct to be concerned that things had improved enough, given the nature of your condition and previous things you had said. PPD is a very serious condition that threatens not only you but the baby, and needs very close monitoring to ensure you don't regress. However, it is also a condition that you can recover from, with treatment and monitoring. Since you now know you are susceptible to this, make sure you have a plan for keeping yourself healthy, and a backup for how you will protect your son's best interests if you do regress. By getting help in the first place, you showed that you are capable of putting his interests first - placing him with your sister was absolutely appropriate at the time, and your doctors and the courts agree that bringing him home is appropriate now.\n\nBest of luck with your ongoing recovery.", "NAH. This sounds like an incredibly difficult situation for you, your son, AND your sister, but from what you've said here, it sounds like everyone has been doing their best. \n\nI'm glad that you reached out and got the help you needed.

I'm glad your son is back home with you now. \n\nAnd yet, none of these wonderful things cancel out how difficult and messy the situation is. You've been through hell and are still working on putting your life back together. Your sister has spent a year caring for and bonding with a baby you told her might be hers forever - and is now adjusting to living without that baby. And your son has experienced tremendous upheaval in his life with absolutely no way to understand what these changes are or why.   None of you are the AH, but all of you are hurting. \n\nI hope things get easier for you and your family soon. In the meantime, please be as kind to each other as you can.", "Is sister angry you got him back? Is she still fighting or trying to regain custody from you?\n\nIf not then I'd say NAH. You had a medical condition. You did what you had to to keep him safe while you got the help you needed. Sister did what she felt she had to do to make sure he would be safe back in your care. I would probably do the same, honestly. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if something bad happened to my nephew and I didn't do everything in my power to prevent it. \n\nAs long as everyone had the baby's best interest at heart, this went exactly how it needed to go and I think thanking your sister for taking care of him and being so careful (if you haven't already that is) might do some good in reassuring the rest of the family that you're doing better.", "NAH", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your family could use some education on what post partum depression is. Good for you and your husband for getting help and getting better.", "NTA the fact you notices something was not right and you and your husband got help is commendable.

You proved yourself and them that you are! And got your baby back.\n\nThere are sooo many parents out there who have their own kids and do not have to proof themselfes. You had to and did it! You should be proud of overcoming depression and being mature enough to know whats best for your child.\n\nIf your sister isn't mad at you for getting your kid back, then she did it also solely for him and is in the right too. If she is mad know, than she is an a******.\n\nAnd all the family members that think you should just give up your kid, because of a medical condition, they can fuck off! Millions of women suffer from post partum and not every one of them is able to speak out loud, get help and overcome it like you did! You made everything right. Would they like to take away every child of a mom with depression or other medical conditions that try to get help? That is ridiculous.\n\nTell them if they have the audacity to shame you again, they can fuck off and never see you or your baby again. \n\nCongrats on doing this and i hope you will always have this lovely relationship with your husband, where you support each other and get through everything together!\n\nNAH", "NTA - you had a known medical condition and made the right call to put your child in a place of supposed safety until you were better.

Dude...", "She didn\u2019t do everything in her power. There were avenues she could have taken that put the child\u2019s best interest first. Could have been an ally with the courts, doctors, and CPS. Ensure a safe and secure environment. She got a lawyer and sued for custody and failed. That was was not about the child.", "It sounds like you have absolutely no idea how bad PPD can get. Postpartum psychosis is also a thing. When women receive the proper treatment and SUPPORT, ultimately the outcomes are good for everyone. I had PPD and PPA. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t as bad as OP, but I still had struggles with intrusive thoughts. When I stopped trying to breastfeed/pump and had my now ex do the night time wake ups, it made a HUGE difference. I\u2019m so glad that I had supportive people around me instead of people like you.", "Well thank you for your perspective", "They can all coparent. And I included links in another comment to articles discussing my, a neuroscience students, imaginary delusions of brain damage.", "He May Not actively consciously remember but his brain and body will. Look into infant and separation trauma, and it\u2019s lifelong neurological and cognitive effects. Here\u2019s a couple articles to get you started: \n\nhttps://www.overcominghateportal.org/uploads/5/4/1/5/5415260/effects_of_early_relational_trauma.pdf\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6969239/\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/361180191_An_introduction_to_the_adoption_and_trauma_special_issue\n\nhttps://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/litigation_committees/childrights/child-separation-memo/parent-child-separation-trauma-memo.pdf\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3534157/", "Andrea Yates was hospitalized twice for psychiatric care, and still murdered her 5 child. Mental healthcare does not have the resources to ensure someone is totally healthy before they are released.", "I'm curious why everyone seems to see CPS as a \"friendlier\" option. Why would that route have been better in this situation? I've never dealt with CPS directly, but I've heard my fair share of horror stories, and while I believe that most of the people that work there do care about doing what's best for the kids, it also seems like they're also consistently overworked, and have more than enough on their plate already. It could've taken them even longer to deal with this situation given the child was already in a safe home with family, I would think this would've been low priority.", "I don't see that in the post. She says \"certain family members\" are upset with her. She didn't mention sister in that group. She doesn't sound upset with sister at any point in the post. You're reading this and assuming the worst of sister, I'm reading it neutral. I think it's far more likely that sister was looking out for the best interests of the child than trying to steal OP's baby, and unless OP or sister shows up here to tell more of the story, I'm not gonna change my mind.", "I understand where you're coming from, and I still disagree. I'm not convinced cps would've been a better choice.", "First, I'm really sorry you went through this horrible ordeal.\n\nHowever, I'm still puzzled over why (in the initial situation) you couldn't keep your baby with your husband and hire a nanny and/or put him in day care instead of essentially giving away custody.", "I\u2019m not trying to be unsupportive. I do understand how bad PPD and PPP get, my mother went from kind to trying to kill me after one pregnancy. \n\nHowever, I am a child advocate. My main concern is always for children. And it seems like you, and all the other commenters might not understand how infant attachment works. \n\nThe baby was attached to mom because she carried him for months and dad because he could hear his voice inside the womb. Being separated from them would have caused him trauma, trauma causes brain damage. There were many other options that OP and husband could have done to keep baby with husband and avoid brain damage. They didn\u2019t. Instead they separated him from both attached caregivers, giving him separation trauma x2. \n\n\nHowever he is young, super young, he can bounce back and probably will be able to attach to someone else. So he stays with aunt, for the first year of his life. Infant attachment takes place between 0 and 6 months. So now he has a new secure attachment to aunt, and he is older than six months old, meaning he cannot make a new infant attachment with his parents. So essentially he has gotten another horrific dose of separation trauma, so brain damage, and this time he\u2019s not young enough to bounce back or form new attachments, that\u2019s road is closed, he is an insecurely attached baby now. This time there was no actual good reason for it, as the adults in the situation should and could have found a three parent solution so the child gets every possible benefit from each of them. \n\nInsecure attachment is linked to low self esteem, mental health issues, developmental disability, and more. \n\nThat is why I disagree with courts, because these sequences of decisions Hurt the Child. The least they could have done is provide the person who put in eight months of labor doing unpaid childcare, visitation \n, and the best they could have done is granted all three parents (because the aunt is a parent at this point, she\u2019s had him half his life) custody. I\u2019m not trying to be an asshole, Im actually anti adoption and very pro three or more parents families, both of those things are BECAUSE of what I have stated here about infant development. \n\nOP still has other options, they can all move in together and raise the child collectively, but instead OP is deciding to treat a living human being, a baby, like property, to reaffirm her ownership over him. Now he is separated from the only secure attachment he has had the opportunity to make.", "Op has done most of the parenting. She has the kid back for months. Raised the kid the first two months of the child's. Had the child since January. The Baby is only ten months old. \n\nIt is most confusing for a child to do what you are suggesting. There doesn't need to be more stress on the child by switching them between an Aunt.", "One of these directly says that adopted children whether placed early or later in life have a higher chance of having trauma which indicates that the issue is the adoption not the time at which they are adopted", "Thanks for the resources, that is definitely an interesting topic.\n\nBut I just skimmed some of them and if I understand correctly, baby already had a traumatic separation when going to the aunt; isn't it probable, baby will recognise its parents?\n\nAnd I quite honestly do not see a healthy \u201ecoparenting\u201c situation with the aunt because from my perspective, she tried to permanently keep the baby from its parents. If that were my child, my sister would never see it again because she already proved she would try to take it given the chance. I'm obviously not an expert, but I would guess the nerological effects of infant trauma going from one caring adult to another would be way less significant than being actually kidnapped by one of those adults.", "Yeah I cant believe some ppl\u2019s comment. Mental health/PPD should not be stigmatized but it also shouldn\u2019t be trivialized. How many Andrea Yates situations could\u2019ve been avoided if only family had stepped in and been this cautious?\n\nIt\u2019s a shitty situation for OP but at least both her and baby are safe.", "You gonna pay OPs bills while that happens?", "He was never a single parent, he had a mentally unhealthy wife he needed to take care of who couldn't be around the child and whose health was the priority.", "I won\u2019t pretend to be an expert - I\u2019ve always just seen a courtroom as a last resort kind of option. Sister could also have had talks with OP\u2019s doctor and maybe some family therapy though, but again, I won\u2019t pretend to know an awful lot, I was just raising the question of it. That said, if sister has now accepted the outcome of the courtroom and isn\u2019t trying to turn family against OP, then I agree that there are no AHs in this situation, I can understand being worried.", "OP made sure her baby was SAFE. She stated her husband traveled for work and she wanted to make sure her child was SAFE while she was recovering. OP also states that she spent a lot of time with her son throughout the process. He absolutely knew who she was. She was not a stranger to him. If her sister had willingly ended the agreement, he would not have spent that much time with his aunt. Instead, she dragged it out for four more months, which only hurts her nephew more. He\u2019s 10 months now and they got him back in January when he would have been approximately 6-7 months old. He was with OP for the first two months of his life. Given that timeline, he really wasn\u2019t with the aunt for all that long at all and his earliest core relationship was with his mom. The doctors and the courts agreed that baby needed to be back with his family. It\u2019s the aunt\u2019s fault that he wasn\u2019t returned during a time when, according to you, he could still make those attachments so really she\u2019s the only one at fault in this situation. \n\nAs a side note, I work in an urban school district. I\u2019ve seen quite a few kids who were separated very young from a parent for various reasons and then reunited. I\u2019ve also seen kids adopted when they were older than a newborn. Not a single one had issues relating back to that. If it was something that was truly concerning, advocates would be making sure it didn\u2019t happen and psychologists would be regularly testifying against parent reunification. They aren\u2019t. If the aunt was concerned, she also could have gotten an emergency order at any time. She waited until OP wanted the baby back. Aunt just didn\u2019t want to give her nephew back to his actual mom.", "No not shared custody, I agree that would be worse and more traumatic than anything. I was suggesting a three parent household wherein they all live together.", "Yes you got it! Separation trauma literally always causes brain damage (what the word trauma refers to)\u2026that\u2019s why every move made by the adults in this story\u2026was the wrong one. Because the baby ended up with THREE separate separation traumas literally three times the amount of trauma as those you mentioned in that article. For No Reason, ultimately, the adults just didn\u2019t put his interests before theirs, and I agree that if she did it for selfish reasons, the aunt is the biggest contributor to harm. \n\nThose placed later in life are generally attached to their parents or caregivers, just like those placed early, both cause extreme trauma when separated from them.", "I\u2019m not sure how to feel about aunt because it\u2019s still unclear WHY she did this, if it was for selfish reasons and not out of genuine concern that her sister would keep changing her mind back and forth, and she wanted to make sure she was really sure and willing to fight for him, I agree no coparenting could work. The biggest thing giving me pause and making me feel like we don\u2019t have all the info is the other family members being on the aunts side. \n\nYes they will probably recognize their parents and HOPEFULLY would be able to reattach to them, however, brain damage is impossible to undo. You cannot regrow neurons (except with nicotine which no one should give babies) So the trauma from the original separation is still going to be there if that makes sense. On top of that there will be a new and additional trauma from the new separation from the sister. I think all the adults suck here but mostly the sister if she was being selfish.", ">I just feel like there could have been so many other options including having cps come in do home visits. Having a psychiatric evaluation don\u2019t. Parenting classes. Things the sister could have worked with the authorities to make sure the child was safe.\n\nhow do you imagine OP's sister could have \"worked with authorities\" to arrange any of this without triggering legal proceedings about the child's custody?\n\nif any of those items were needed, then going through the legal process is appropriate.", "Thanks for your thoughts. I'm definitely not an expert either, I've just seen some bad interactions with CPS, and heard of massive delays once they get involved. Maybe that's a rarity, but it seemed pretty consistent in my area.", "[deleted]", "That is not realistic at all. Is her sister never supposed to have a partner or are you proposing a quad. The child will be fine from separation from his mother for two months with proper attention. It something many children who are born I'll or have mothers get seriously ill after birth over come", "I don't think you understand what you are citing. Most of the articles you reference are discussing abuse both physical and sexual and the effects it can have at a young age. One is about adoption trauma which is much different from being temporarily placed with a family member. Nowhere do they say that two months away is enough time to cause life long brain damage, nor do they discuss what that damage looks like. However what we have is a mother suffering from post partum psychosis. Since just a few weeks ago there was a very public case of a woman killing her children while suffering from this illness there is no questioning how dangerous it is and if you are actively suffering from post partum psychosis the best thing you can do is step away. So that was the correct choice\nConsidering one of the articles you linked is about adoption trauma that means adoption will also cause trauma so the best thing she can do is when she is well reclaim and care for her child. So that was the correct choice.", "She would have went through cps. And cps would have given her temporary custody.\n\nHere is here this would have benefited op. They would have given op supervised visists during this process. Op probably would not have spent thousands on legal fees. Given cps first priory is reunified parents and child. Cps would have helped op enroll in programs to help her. For her into parenting classes. Down psychical evaluation. Plus extra safety precaution would be cps probably would still making home visits. Which would help ensure baby safety. If op wasn\u2019t quite to the point she needed to be cps would not have terminated her custody as long as she was still seeking treatment. They would have gotten her more treatment options.\n\nSisters option caused op to have a temporary restating order in place. It didn\u2019t focus on reuniting the family only proving if she was fit. Sisters option caused op thousands in court and legal fees. There is no one monitoring baby with op now(which is safety was first priory you would want this). Sister option was I am suing you for custody and if you can prove your safe I am keeping the baby. This offered op no help is she needed it. \n\nTo me this is the big difference\n\n\nAnd to answer your question to me it was almost as if sister thought doing it her way would either hurt op\u2019s healing process or break them financially. Where as cps I don\u2019t think lawyers would have been need to reunite the family.", "So by OP\u2019s own numbers:\nBaby spent two months with her when first born (2)\nBaby then went to her sister. OP notified her sister that she and her doctors agreed that it was time for her son to come back. Aunt then dragged out the court case for four months (4)\nBaby came back home at 6-7 months depending on how old he was at that time. Baby has been with OP since (3-4) \n\nSo by that math, the one who\u2019s done the most actual parenting is OP! OP would have done even more \u201cactual parenting\u201d if the aunt hadn\u2019t dragged out the court case so the aunt is absolutely the AH here, even with your own explanations (and actually even moreso when accounting for what you said).", "you bring up some great points about things OP could have done or engaged with to get in a better position to begin caring for her child -- parenting classes, seeking additional resources and supports, etc.\n\nwhy didn't OP do any of those things herself before she set a date for when she would take the child home with her? why didn't her husband help? they could've reached out to CPS themselves to get the ball rolling or worked with OP's medical provider on next steps.\n\nwhy is it the sister's responsibility to make those arrangements, particularly while she was already doing 100% of the care for OP's child, presumably working, etc?\n\nif OP had taken some of the steps you suggest, there might not have been a need for an emergency custody petition.\n\n>it was almost as if sister thought doing it her way would either hurt op\u2019s healing process or break them financially.\n\nthis is wild speculation."]}
