This is a very messy situation.\n\nYWBTA if in the midst of this, you have completely severed the connection between your sister and your son for your own ego. Like it or not, fair or not, your kid thinks of your sister as his primary caregiver. Completely severing this tie between them so that YOU can replace your sister isn't going to take away the bond between him and his aunt, it's only going to create a trauma that he won't have words for. She should still be a part of his life in some capacity if she is willing to be.\n\nThis is a mess. Family therapy or some kind of external mediator would probably help here.

I work in child welfare, reunification is the main goal we work towards whenever possible.

I\u2019m happy for you and proud of you and your husbands journey through this together!! \n\nThat being said, since everyone backed your sister on forcing you to fight for custody and prove your fitness, everyone should agree with the judge\u2019s ruling that you having custody is best for your child. They don\u2019t have any right to be upset with you, and they are assholes for making you feel bad for proving yourself, like they wanted, and earning full custody. You EARNED this, the judge agrees that this is best for your child, and everyone should see that and accept the outcome of the custody case. You should be proud of yourself for how far you\u2019ve come and everyone else should be proud of you as well. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about what they think is best for your child, because the judge made that decision with aaaaallll of the information they thought proved you were an unfit mother, this is about them being pissed and jealous that they lost. What does your family have against you that they want to punish you like this? They should be overjoyed that you\u2019re better and willing and capable to raise your own child.

This is betrayal.", ">She told me it was my job to prove to a judge that i was a fit mother.\n\nI'm not sure how you perceive that to be an unreasonable statement? Given the mental health history here, and the fact that you essentially abandoned an infant, it seems *incredibly important* to ensure that you are stable enough to care for an infant before turning over care.\n\nYour sister cannot call your psychiatrist and ask that question due to medical privacy laws. So the courts are the only possible arbiter in this situation to ensure your child's safety.\n\nYou being angry that your sister did due diligence to ensure the safety of your child is UNREASONABLE. Your sister took over care of your infant when you were not able to. The only emotion you should be feeling towards her right now is gratitude. Instead, this post reeks of entitlement.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIs this baby your daughter or your son?\n\nIf you are going to make up stories on the internet you need to be consistent in order to get people to believe you.", "YTA\n\nWhat did ***your doctors*** say about you taking back your child?\n\nJust because you miss him and want him back, doesn't mean you're ready and able to provide care.\n\nAlso, why wasn't your husband, her father, caring for him?  Even if he had to work, daycare when your husband was working, and working together to care for your child when your husband wasn't working would have provided more consistency of care.\n\nIn the end, what matters is not what you want, or how many chances you deserve.  What matters is the best interests of the child.\n\nYou say your child is 10 months now, mid-April.  You wanted her back in Sept., at which point she would have been 3 months old.  You had your breakdown at 2 months old, which would be August.\n\nSo, over the course of one month, you realized you had PPD, were hospitalized for 2 weeks, spent more time adjusting your meds, talked about giving custody to your sister, and then wanted her back.\n\nThat is one heck of a roller coaster.\n\nI do not blame your sister for being reluctant to return your child at that time.  You hadn't been feeling better for long enough to show that you're really stabilized.\n\nAnd your child had already gone through one major change in their life, being abruptly moved from your care to your sister's care.  You weren't proposing a gradual takeover of care, carefully supervised by your doctors to make sure you were okay, you just wanted your child back, another abrupt disruption just as she was adapting to your sister.\n\nAnd if it proved to be overwhelming, again, and you had another breakdown, would your child wind up back with your sister?  Your child is not a hot potato to be tossed back and forth depending on how your feel.\n\nFrom what you've written, it's all about you, and how you feel, and not about what your doctors think is appropriate for your condition, or about stability and the best interests of your child.", "NAH. You were sick and got appropriate help, but your sister was correct to be concerned that things had improved enough, given the nature of your condition and previous things you had said. PPD is a very serious condition that threatens not only you but the baby, and needs very close monitoring to ensure you don't regress. However, it is also a condition that you can recover from, with treatment and monitoring. Since you now know you are susceptible to this, make sure you have a plan for keeping yourself healthy, and a backup for how you will protect your son's best interests if you do regress. By getting help in the first place, you showed that you are capable of putting his interests first - placing him with your sister was absolutely appropriate at the time, and your doctors and the courts agree that bringing him home is appropriate now.\n\nBest of luck with your ongoing recovery.", "NAH. This sounds like an incredibly difficult situation for you, your son, AND your sister, but from what you've said here, it sounds like everyone has been doing their best. \n\nI'm glad that you reached out and got the help you needed. I'm glad that your sister was able to take care of him. I'm glad you're doing better. I'm glad your sister cared enough to be careful about where your son goes. I'm glad your son is back home with you now. \n\nAnd yet, none of these wonderful things cancel out how difficult and messy the situation is. You've been through hell and are still working on putting your life back together. Your sister has spent a year caring for and bonding with a baby you told her might be hers forever - and is now adjusting to living without that baby. And your son has experienced tremendous upheaval in his life with absolutely no way to understand what these changes are or why.   None of you are the AH, but all of you are hurting. \n\nI hope things get easier for you and your family soon. In the meantime, please be as kind to each other as you can.", "Is sister angry you got him back? Is she still fighting or trying to regain custody from you?\n\nIf not then I'd say NAH. You had a medical condition. You did what you had to to keep him safe while you got the help you needed. Sister did what she felt she had to do to make sure he would be safe back in your care. I would probably do the same, honestly. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if something bad happened to my nephew and I didn't do everything in my power to prevent it. \n\nAs long as everyone had the baby's best interest at heart, this went exactly how it needed to go and I think thanking your sister for taking care of him and being so careful (if you haven't already that is) might do some good in reassuring the rest of the family that you're doing better.", "NAH", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your family could use some education on what post partum depression is. Good for you and your husband for getting help and getting better.", "NTA the fact you notices something was not right and you and your husband got help is commendable.

You made a hard decision and it worked out for you and for your son.\n\nYour sister made the desicion to let professionals decide if you are fit for being a mom. You proved yourself and them that you are! And got your baby back.\n\nThere are sooo many parents out there who have their own kids and do not have to proof themselfes. You had to and did it! You should be proud of overcoming depression and being mature enough to know whats best for your child.\n\nIf your sister isn't mad at you for getting your kid back, then she did it also solely for him and is in the right too. If she is mad know, than she is an a******.\n\nAnd all the family members that think you should just give up your kid, because of a medical condition, they can fuck off! Millions of women suffer from post partum and not every one of them is able to speak out loud, get help and overcome it like you did! You made everything right. Would they like to take away every child of a mom with depression or other medical conditions that try to get help? That is ridiculous.\n\nTell them if they have the audacity to shame you again, they can fuck off and never see you or your baby again. \n\nCongrats on doing this and i hope you will always have this lovely relationship with your husband, where you support each other and get through everything together!\n\nNAH", "NTA - you had a known medical condition and made the right call to put your child in a place of supposed safety until you were better.

But that said, it's important to also recognize the sacrifices others made to support you through it and ensure the safety of your child. I am glad you have been reunited.", "Yeah, fuck that guy for having his whole life fall apart and not doing everything perfectly. You have no idea what he went through, completely blaming him like this is so shifty.", "Oh I completely agree, guess I should say what I want is more info because she most likely would have never been in that mess if her husband stepped up more for his kid. I know it\u2019s a hard situation but it seems insanely detached as a father to accept their previous setup.", "Because she said dangerous and scary things about her baby, of course her sister will forever have concerns. You can't unsay things, people always remember them regardless of whether you now are \"better\". \n\nHer sister has done her and her baby a massive favour by looking after her, and by making sure professionals agree she's safe.", "I agree, and the emergency petition for custody was BS.  It\u2019s not an emergency unless the kid is in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.   Mental health treatment isn\u2019t enough, especially when it\u2019s in the past.  I think the sister is total TA", "she didnt try to steal her baby. she did exactly what she should've done to ensure the baby was going to safe stable home after being the primary caregiver for several months", "I don\u2019t really think this is fair to the sister. She was being cautious. It\u2019s a process and the OP worked through it to get her child back after proving she could. This was a court ordered process so clearly the decision was not made by the sister.", "You mean abandoning their child an coming back when she \"missed him\". There's ways to get support without abandonment. YTA.", "Thank you and you are right. It Is an amazing thing having people care for your child as you do and to ensure his safety", "There\u2019s a level of grace that should absolutely be given to people who find themselves in incomprehensibly tough situations. However, to be an able bodied, mentally-well new father and just shrug while your kid has essentially been *rehomed* for months on end is insane. He had so little custody of his own child that the court didn\u2019t even recognize him as a safe or viable alternative in comparison to OPs sister and the fight in court went on for additional months. That type of apathy is truly unmatched.", "You can be cautious by asking your sister to go to her to the doctor to see everything is fine and the doctor can confirm you do NOT GET EMERGENCY CUSTODY of op s child  using information from months ago that's not relevant anymore since op is cured. This was a huge ah move and a betrayal of the worst kind.", "They protected the child when op wasn't well enough to be around the baby. \n\nDespite her illness op did the best for her child. \n\nShe didn't abandoned her child -ppd can make the mother 'want' to harm the baby .\n\n The best thing op could do is get the baby away from her until she was cured/under control and she did that at a huge personal sacrifice by letting her baby go to someone who could take care of the baby and not endanger the baby. \n\nIf I read correctly between the lines this is what happened to op so I will stick with NTA.\n\nOp didn't just passed her baby to someone else as an unwanted accessory which she now wants back but  she had a major psychological health problem and she used this time away from the baby to safeguard the baby safety and get healthy again.", "There was a recent case of a woman who unalived all of her children and tried to kill herself while she was being treated for postpartum mental health issues. It's not just a case of the blues or being in a bad mood. It can make loving mothers  do absolutely horrible things.", "Just wanted to respond that he traveled out of town frequently for work and the courts did find him to be a fit father but my sister and their lawyer kept pushing back the actual trial date until January. It had nothing to do with his parenting ability. He has recently quit his job to be home more often with us because he was so devastated about everything that happened he wants to ensure we never go through that again.", "how does the sister know OP is healthy and stable and will remain so long-term? how does she know things are safe and stable in the marriage OP was threatening to leave, with the husband who did not participate in the child's care while OP was getting well?\n\nthe sister had no way of knowing these things.\n\nwe also don't know how unwell OP really was during her illness. it's likely that she said and did things that gave her sister serious concerns about the child's safety and it makes sense to want to be sure before handing over care.\n\nOP's sister did the right thing.", "It wild how people are saying the the family court are experts over the op\u2019s doctor.", "Where the fuck was dad? Work isn't an excuse. If all the single moms in the world can do it, so could he. And he chose not to. They are a unit and it is their fault things went the way it did.", "So he quit his job now after the whole fiasco, but couldn\u2019t during the months to year duration when it would have actually been beneficial? Also, emergency custody wouldn\u2019t have been granted to her to begin with if the baby could stay with your husband. I don\u2019t know, something just really doesn\u2019t add up here.", ">So he quit his job now after the whole fiasco, but couldn\u2019t during the months to year duration when it would have actually been beneficial?\n\nyeah, would've been really beneficial to lose a job and the related health insurance while his wife and mother of his child was in the grip of an intensive mental health gauntlet. \ud83d\ude10", "Do you think it's wise to quit a very well paying job when you have to pay a lawyer upwards of 15 grand in the span of 4 months? This was an ongoing thing not a \"we left him for a year\" we fought for him."]}
