I would tell them about your concerns before it\u2019s too late, however.", "NTA, and you do need to be honest that it is too much for you\u2014there is no shame in this. It is irresponsible of your parents to try to put you in this situation. Having an uncle come now and then is not enough support, especially given that you work all day.", "NTA. I don't blame your parents for needing a break but, presumably they know your work schedule - what exactly did they expect seeing that you work 10 hours a day? Were they expecting you to take time off? This is poorly planned at a minimum and you're not an AH for being unable to provide the level of round-the-clock care that she needs. They need to find some professional services or another solution.", "I think you should voice your concerns. If you go through with caring for her and as you mentioned you might not notice if anything happens and something happens it would probably be worse to explain than explaining how you worry that you couldn\u2019t take care of her as much as she needs. If it\u2019s a very serious situation you should consider hiring someone for 10 days.", "NTA, but also one always lacks experience in caregiving until they do it. \n\nI've been doing this way longer than I'd like to think about. It's scary at first for sure. You're right to want to talk about your concerns.", "NTA. You have raised some valid concerns, your deep sleep and your long working hours, which will mean you're out of the house most of the day and she probably won't get the right amount of attention. You should talk to your parents about hiring a caregiver and you can be there to emotionally support your grandma, since she might feel awkward with a stranger, but you won't be taking on a responsibility you are ill-suited to handle.", "NTA. This is a huge responsibility and you clearly have responsibilities of your own. Your parents should have made a proper care plan for her that involved someone fully willing and able to care for her rather than just expecting you to do it because family. Plus there\u2019s the medical factor too of watching for falls or coughs and you\u2019re not a trained care professional. If hiring someone to care for her is expensive, they shouldn\u2019t have gone on the trip", "NTA, who takes care of her when you will be at work or sleeping. Don't even think about it, express your concerns, they need to hire a nurse.", "Many residential homes offer respite care - basically they take in temporary cases so that the carers can have a well earned break. These can be for a few days or weeks and whilst the are not free of charge, the cost may not be much different than \u201clost wages\u201d if another family member is willing and able to take time off work.", "They need to hire a temporary care giver or care giver service. Ten days is a long time to be absent, especially when you\u2019re gone 10 hours or more per day. A lot can happen in that time. \n\nNTA. But tell your parents they MUST hire someone for your grandmother\u2019s safety.", "Sounds like you rely on family.\n\nAnd now, they rely on you.\n\nNot so easy is it? Being accountable for someone else. Sadly that's what and how it is.\n\nFrom an objective standpoint, NTA. Voice your concerns, hash it out.\n\nFrom the familial perspective, YTA.

That is not an asshole move.  \n\nRefusing to do so and denying your parents their vacation? That's an asshole move.  She's your grandma.  These are your parents.  You live with them.

Based on the info you\u2019ve given, 10 days to see if she falls over or not is nothing. Don\u2019t you WANT to care for her? I mean they\u2019re obviously aware you won\u2019t be around for most of the day, but if they think you\u2019re suitable I don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t want to help.

How much assistance does she require? \n\nYes. Taking care of an elderly person is hard.  Raise your hand if you\u2019ve done it.

Are you saying that you sleep so heavy that you are not cognizant of what happens in your house every night?\n\nWhen I took care of my grandpa, I slept on the couch so I could be close to his bedroom.

For failure, the consequences are grave.  Learning must be accomplished before OP starts to care for grandma.", "Being born and taken care of by the people who had you doesn\u2019t mean you owe them anything.  Raising a child you birthed is kind of the bare minimum. \n\nSure it\u2019s great if you want to and can help out, but just because you were born doesn\u2019t mean your indebted to your family for the rest of your life.", "I think if anything OP is concerned about her grandmother\u2019s wellbeing if she is left alone as the sole caregiver over the 10 days.  \n\nA lot goes into elder care (as someone who\u2019s done this as a job), and being gone 10+ hours through the day is a long time for OPs grandmother to be alone.  Anything can happen in those 10 hours (cough worsens, a serious fall, etc.) and OP would go unaware for hours potentially.  Even if no emergencies occur, there\u2019s nobody around to help with meals or toileting for the entire day.  \n\nIt\u2019s not as simple as \u201crefusing to help\u201d.", "Exactly. \n\nYeah, maybe you're scared that you can't take care of poor Grandma, but if you have half a brain, you'll figure it out. Besides, your Uncle will be available to help or call if you need help. It's only 10 days, not 10 years. \n\nGrandma is likely as scared as you are. She's sick, fragile, and not able to care for herself like she used to.  She's probably feeling guilty that she's a burden on her children and now her grandchild.   Treat her with love and compassion, and you'll be fine.\n\nAlso, FYI, it's incredably stressful having to care for an elderly parent - so don't begrudge your parents for needing time for themselves.

You do your best.  You prepare for falls and provide meals and check in often but yes, the cough might worsen and not be noticed for a few hours.  We don't have perfect safety nets.", "I disagree, OP is there for emergencies or if cough worsens, THATS IT.  Not administer meds or cooking, he is hanging out.  His thing seems to be his sleep, which gave me the feeling is he didnt want to be bothered.  This guy is 26, lives at home and his parents seem to have been doing the lions share of her care giving.  They want to go on vacation, guessing a well deserved break, and asked him to hang out and he balks.  If his \"deep sleep\" is such a concern, get grandma a couple air horns and place them all around the house so if she falls she can blast for help.  \n\nGive me a break with OP and his \"concerns\".", "Says her Uncle will assist with showering and didn't say if grandma will be left alone during the day.
