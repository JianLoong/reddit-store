You might see if they'd be willing to see if her insurance would cover a short term care facility due to the broken arm for now or an in home caregiver. Those cost from $15-$40 an hour usually where I live.  Sometimes you can get a CNA student to do so for a little cheaper. Or see if your uncle can stay at the house and help? It is a difficult position and you need to talk to your parents now before they continue making plans you are going to disrupt.", "NTA. Being a carer is a hard job and it\u2019s crucial to know what to do in case an accident happens. Lifting, assisting to walk, preparing food, feeding if swallowing or using cutlery is difficult, helping with personal care like showering or using the toilet, dressing, giving medication and applying dressings or cream if that\u2019s prescribed- all of that requires some experience and if you are working full time, asleep for some of the rest and have no experience then this is an accident waiting to happen. Plus you don\u2019t feel comfortable. That is reason enough by itself. Personal care isn\u2019t for everyone, if you aren\u2019t comfortable helping wash your grandmother or wiping her ass, touching her naked body or assisting her to dress and doing her hair then you shouldn\u2019t do it. \n\n\nI\u2019m also wondering how comfortable your grandmother is. Your parents seem to be making plans without talking to her about whom she is comfortable receiving assistance from for intimate care tasks. Is your grandmother comfortable with a male caregiver in the form of your uncle, her son? Would she prefer a woman? I\u2019d advise speaking with your grandmother, provided she can speak and give her opinion, and asking what her wishes are. A respite carer or nurse can come to assist her, this person will be a professional who will know how to handle all the care tasks, this takes pressure off you and your uncle, gives your grandmother dignity and care plus sets her up for the future which will include needing a carer. Your parents can\u2019t be expected to handle all of her care nor can you, their own health may not permit it, plus it\u2019s a full time job and they have lives. You said that her condition will deteriorate so it\u2019s best to get a care plan in place now so that when the time comes she is safe, cared for and the family can relax and enjoy time with her without being the full time nurse which can breed resentment and burnout.", "I read through the comments to find this. Not saying it\u2019s a given but if grandma has Medicare or Medicaid , obviously this is in the US, they sometimes allow like a week of respite care per year. They should check into that.", "That will cost about $10,000.  No joke.", "I was going to say this! They need to work with a home health care team to come in and look after her. So I would definitely have your parents look into it. It would be beneficial for all of you!", "I think you are not aware of how costly this is.  In Massachusetts, at least, you are talking over $800/day.", "And when grandma slips in the bathroom after OP leaves for work and isn't found found for 10+ hours, the bill is going to be FAR higher.\n\n93 with a broken arm, she needs professional care.", "Exactly this! It would be one thing if grandma was mostly independent and just needed someone with her in the early morning and at night to help with meals and keep things tidy and run errands and stick close by during showers just in case she slipped. But she\u2019s at a point where she needs a lot more individualized attention than a single working adult can provide. \n\nGrandma will be much better off with a professional (like a home health nurse or aide) staying with her during the day to help monitor her cough, assist with showers, and ensure she\u2019s taking the correct medications at the correct times while OP *and* uncle stay close at night just in case. Though if she\u2019s like many old people and \u201csundowns\u201d at night (meaning her cognitive functions decline at night), she might need someone full time.", "The asshole move is being a 26 year old mooching off the family but being unwilling to contribute.", "Paying the rent for a working 26 year old, which appears to be the case here, is beyond bare minimum.  OP needs to help out.  Maybe not 24/7, but she needs to take a shift each day while the parents are gone.", "Then that's on Grandma to find and take care of she's an adult she can take care of her own things.  It's not on her 20 something grandchild to take care of her", "No where in OPs post did they say they still lived at home with their parents.", "I was more referring to childhood/ being raised.  Housing and caring for a full adult is definitely above minimum.  It\u2019s more the point that family can often times expect too much or put too much pressure on other members of the family despite their discomfort or the risks it could have for the parties involved.  An example older siblings being left to raise younger ones, or being expected to house/care for parents despite not having the means to do so.
