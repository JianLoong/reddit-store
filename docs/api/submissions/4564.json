Your Doctor has already told you it was fine and you had indication that he's ready to try solid foods.  That's all there is to say.  NTA\n\nYour sister needs to learn to mind her own business.", "NTA. My son got rice cereal and then some pureed veggies around 4-5 months, because he was clearly hungry, wanted to try different stuff, and the doc said it was fine unless it gave him digestive issues, at which point we should stop and wait a bit. It did not. He thought sweet potato and beets were the Best Tastes Ever (and the latter gave us the best Vampire Baby pictures).\n\nHe is currently a robustly healthy sixteen-year-old, an adventurous eater who will try food from any number of cuisines and cultures. He is not, you may inform your sister, dead.\n\nYour pediatrician says it's fine. Your sister is not a pediatrician. Your baby is happy and healthy. You're doing well.", "NTA. If your pediatrician says it's OK, then it's fine. Mine both started on solids at 4 months because that was the recommendation at the time. They were much happier babies. By 6 months, my older son could sometimes eat more than me. He's now a healthy, happy 17 year old.", "NTA. In germany it\u2019s recommended to start at 4 months because the immune system is very open between 4 and 6m and you can prevent some food allergies by introducing them. We started with mashed foods one week before our daughter was four months old because she was always trying to grab food from us.", "NTA- it\u2019s just sweet potato. It\u2019s not like you trying to give the baby a steak. Tell your mom and your sister to mind their own business. You discussed with the pediatrician and you felt comfortable with what they told you and went from there.", "NTA. If your doctor is fine with it then who is your sister to say otherwise.", "Pediatric PA here. Every baby is indeed different but if your baby already hit certain milestones it\u2019s perfectly fine to try solids at that age. In fact the American Academy of Pediatrics says it\u2019s fine to start at 4 months as long as certain milestones have been reached as well. Sweet potatoes is a great one to try, and if your baby is handling it well then great! If not, wait longer. Simple as that.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already done all of this/planned for this but introduce one new good at a time to watch for allergies, expect changes in poop, brush up on infant CPR, and Solid Starts is a great app to help in the solids introduction process.\n\nOh and NTA.", "NTA. Babies can start solid food at 4 months if they are ready. The usual time to wait is 6 months, but if your baby is ready before 6 mo. you can start them early. The baby has to want the food. Just because you let your baby have some solid food doesn't mean you're going to stop breastfeeding.\n\nI'm assuming the sweet potato was pureed because it could be a choking hazard.", "NTA. How many kids does your sister have? Watch for them trying to file false CPS reports though.", "NTA, seems you already discussed this with your child's MD.  Follow their recommendations.  Your sister and mother need to back off.  Your sister badly over reacted and you asked her to leave, end of story.", "NTA This is absolutely none of her business. You're not giving the baby whole grapes.", "NTA. We did BLW and my daughter started eating sweet potatoes around 6 months. She wasn\u2019t ready before that; she would spit food out reflexively when we offered it.", "NTA. 20 weeks is ~5 months. My daughter was testing solids at 4 and eating a decent variety by 5-6. All done under the guidance of her pediatrician. Some babies are recommended to wait until 6+ months, but it sounds like your doctor knows and is good with it.", "NTA, I will admit that my daughter was born 20 years ago and I know things change. I started my daughter on baby rice and pureed vegetables at 4 months, she was really hungry and was not satisfied with just milk. The advice then was from 4 months onwards, but to follow your baby's need as it's usually obvious to the parents when they are ready.", "NTA, there is a way to give your opinion without being an asshole and clearly your sister can\u2019t fathom how to do that , also people who think they know everything are just the worst.", "NTA your family is unhinged", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re doing what you\u2019ve discussed is best with your doctor\u2019s recommendation for YOUR child. I think your sister is TA. She has no right to come into your home and yell at you for your choices in parenting. Also, what\u2019s the point in telling you that you\u2019re going to kill your baby? Was the baby choking? \n\nIt sounds to me like your sister has some personal anxiety around child rearing that she needs to deal with on her own.", "NTA I'm a mum of 4 and all of mine started eating solid food at 4-6 months. Mashed sweet potato was a favourite too.", "NTA \nWas feeding my baby sweet potatoes at 4 mos. He thrived", "FWIW I was eating fragments of stilton cheese and soft chunks of marmite on toast at 6 months.\n\nI didn't die either.\nMy grandmother absolutely hit the roof though.", "NTA  my baby is 11 months and I\u2019ve been giving her food like fried and mash potatoes and stuff like that.

Its a little early and if the only readiness sign is putting toys in mouth, they arent really ready and they won't get much in their bodies but it can be fun for them to play. \n\nI have a 7 month old who only just started wanting solids. Make sure you're infant CPR certified, don't force them to eat (I load a spoon and let my son grab it and put it in his mouth) and prepare for lots of messes! Go crazy.", "INFO: How old is your baby?\n\nGumming on objects indicates teething, not a baby\u2019s desire for textural variety (how would they even know that exists, really).  Also, there are specific foods you have to introduce as first foods based on a baby\u2019s ability to digest. Did your pediatrician specifically approve sweet potatoes and solids for your baby, or did he just say that babies develop at different rates as a general statement?", "NTA, I'm not a kid expert nor a doctor (nor is your sister) so I have no clue if you can give sweet potatoes to a baby. But you're following your doctor suggestions and your sister is overreacting", "INFO: Have you asked a doctor if *they* think baby is ready?", "INFO: How old is your baby?", "How old is the child?  I wouldn't be feeding solids (except oatmeal) until at least 6m. They are not ready.", "The fact that babies put stuff in their mouths is not an indication that they are hungry. At around 4-5 months they start being curious hence the tasting part. It is proved that the digestive tract is not yet fully developed before 6 months so it is strongly recommended to start diversifying after the baby passes the 6 month mark. And you start with half a teaspoon a day to let the stomach adjust to solid foods. \n\nYou should seek out a second and even third opinion. Also search for stories where babies were fed solids too early and see what happened. \n\nThis is a situation where you definitely shouldn't rush things along and waiting is safer.", "NTA, your sister needs to mind her own business. She is literally the anti vaxxer of Gerber baby food", "Info. Pureed or mashed or solid chunks?", "Meh. Kids vary. I was determined to hold off on solids until 6 months but my 5 month old had other ideas -- leaned forward, picked up a slice of bread and started eating it. We reckoned that probably indicated he was ready for some solids. \n\nNTA but be kind to your SIL. Sometimes the way baby information is communicated does make it sound like life or death. It's all stressful when they're tiny.", "ESH your child will gum everything because babies interact with all of their senses and it's part of how they experience the world. Having a handful of children in our house, the prevailing wisdom of multiple doctors was that their systems were designed to run on milk for at least the first 6 months, so we didnt dare introduce solids before then, and at first it was mostly non fibrous offerings such as stewed apple etc, so maybe just check with your doctor.\n\nAs an adult it's kinda difficult to stand by and watch someone do something to a child that you think might be harmful, so I get your sisters panic, I think you're all being a little dramatic, but rather at blowing up at your family, I'd do the research yourself and just double check that your child system is old enough to cope with sweet potato etc.i mean it sounds fairly innocuous but I'd double check before arguing with people.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can listen to other peoples advice, but in the end do what you feel is best for your child.  If he\u2019s reaching for food, nothing wrong with letting him taste it, I did the same.  At 20 weeks he needs to get all of his nutrition from milk, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with him trying things.

I have 10 years between my oldest and youngest and in that time the feeding age moved from 4 months to 6 months. It\u2019s not just about them reaching and putting things in their mouth it\u2019s about being able to push food from the front to the back of the mouth, good posture and neck support. Also introducing foods before their ready can cause increased risk to them developing a food allergy that they might not have had otherwise.

When my oldest was a baby 30+ years ago, it was like 3 months to start solids.\n\nThere are signs you can look for such as being able to sit well supported and having lost the tongue thrust. Realistically, it's likely at 4.5 months, your baby is still doing the tongue thrust which indicates he's not ready for solids.\n\nI understand when you're a first time mom that it's exciting to start solids.

Probably do blend it for safety sake.", "Food is supposed to be pureed.  Because this is your first baby, you should be introducing one food at a time.
