I work 9-5 remote and I used to work many overtime hours (it was expected of us) but I decided to no longer stay back since I resigned.

He said that since I'm working remote, it's no big deal for me to stay back a couple of minutes or even log back on since it's not like I'm driving my way back to office.

I have to hit Snooze on the reminder for my 5:00 meeting.\"  At 1 minute before 5:00, you say, \"Sorry, gotta go.  My 5:00 starts in a minute.

It's nice of you to help out, but trust me, you will not be able to provide them with every bit of knowledge they need in this short time frame.

They need to get their shit sorted by the time you\u2019re gone, and if they don\u2019t, they can pay your consulting rate (3x whatever your equivalent hourly rate would be) for you to field John\u2019s questions.\n\nIf the institutional knowledge locked up in that noggin of yours is that valuable to the company that John needs to bug you after hours, then they\u2019ll pay to keep access to it. Alternatively, they\u2019ll figure out how to go on without you. \n\nThe upshot is to be *strict* about time and your boundaries for the time being, as you\u2019re doing.

NTA and it is not your problem.  I hate that jobs make you train your successor anyway.  Hope you are out of that place soon and on to better things.", "If John has a question, he can write it down. In fact, tell John that you would welcome his questions at the start of the work day. Because that's when real training can begin. Write down all of the things -- you will help him as long as you are there. Between 9 and 5, as long as you are still there.\n\nSorry, stealth edit! NTA", "He'll be calling OP even after the notice period is done AND OP is working at another business.(I've seen stories of people who do that).", "John is also remote. He seems to be working the full day.", "Did you call things emergency too, in the midst of your dark years there?  Is it a mindset employees develop that leaves them thinking everything is an emergency?\n\nOr do they call it an Emergency just to manipulate others into rushing to get things done?", "What is the saying? John's lack of planning doesn't constitute an emergency on your part.", "No I never called anything an emergency. I was also mainly on my own to figure things out. \n\nI think they call it an emergency because they can\u2019t address/solve things on their own so to them it is an emergency.", "The consistency of his calling you after hours is interesting. Makes it seem deliberate.", "NTA.  It's called boundaries.  Good for you for sticking to them.", "NOPE - NTA. John sucks.  Unless someone's life is literally on the line, feel no guilt whatsoever for logging out at 5pm.", "NTA. This a power play by John. He can ask questions before 5 or wait until the next day.", "NTA. You made it very clear to him and reminded him you log off at 5pm. It\u2019s on him he knew it but tried taking advantage of you. He should have respected the boundary you put in place.", "NTA. You're out at 5pm. Anything else can wait.  You're not doing surgery remotely. Smh", "NTA at all. Keep doing what you're doing! (And if it were me I'd block his number on my personal phone.) Congratulations on quitting!", "NTA. This guys is just manipulative. He seems to enjoy pushing your boundaries.  If you want, you could call him on that.", "NTA, you can tell John that he's part of the toxic work environment you are leaving behind and for him to enjoy his stay.", "NTA but tell him your rate for private training and how to send you money for anything after 5pm.", "Have a template similar to outlook email when someone is out for vacation and unavailable. Something like, \n\u201cThank you for your message. I will be away from my computer during non working hours of 5pm until the following work day of 7:59 am. If you require immediate assistance, please contact [name of colleague] at [colleague\u2019s contact information]. Otherwise, I\u2019ll get back to you after I return during official work hours\u201d \n\nNTA. Let him keep that Boomer mentality.", "NTA.  John is trying a power move.  Make you stay past your boundary.  Be firm.  Ignore anything after 5.  And don't explain.  If he says \"but you can\".  Just respond \"I can, but I won't\".  And don't feel guilty.  This is one of the reasons you resigned.  Own it.  You have taken control.  Keep it.", "NTA. \n\na) You've resigned. You owe nobody anything.\n\nb) People who drip-feed over instant message apps at work are incredibly annoying. It is a waste of time.\n\nc) The fact that you feel guilty about this shows that this workplace's culture has done a number on you. I hope you find somewhere much better and I'm sorry you were put through this.", "NTA.  Once notice has been given.  No emergency.  Is a TRUE emergency.  The OP is there to train.  If the person being trained.  Doesn't take advantage of the notice period.  So be it.  It is no longer the OP's problem.  Any TRUE emergency.  Well.  That can be handled by others.", "If OP wanted to be really petty, he could send an email out, \"I have trained John in x, x and x.\" on his last day.", "Not the asshole", "Even if it's an emergency is that even your problem anymore?", "Yep, for some people it's too difficult though \ud83d\ude02. At my new workplace, my 1st day was during everyone's vacations, and I was sent to a client (IT work). My manager said he would log in on Monday morning (his vacation time), and he said he would give me his private number or take his work phone.\n\nMy answer : I don't work during my holidays, so I don't expect people to during theirs. It's not my 1st job, 1st week is learning about the project, nothing will happen, except an extreme emergency about me being fired, we should be able to manage. That became a running joke about how I was bossing my boss before even starting working", "NTA in a gazillion years.\n\nYour day finished at 5.00 old mate can work within the normal working day. \n\nI would block John as he knows no boundaries and will try to contact you after you have left.\n\nCongratulations on your next chapter and wishing you all the best", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are handling that very well. He can adress his questionds durng work hours. After friday, block him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr tell him ANY question he adresses at you after Friday, 5:00 will need a budget and a signed contract for your consulting.", "\u201cAs I have told you *repeatedly*, **I AM OFF AT 5:00.** If you don\u2019t understand how ***TIME*** works\u2026 dude, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d", "I agree. He's doing it on purpose to fuck with OP. After noticing the pattern OP should have escalated it to their manager by sending John an email about the day ending at 5pm with no exceptions and CC her manager. I don't understand why OP allowed this behavior to continue so long.", "NTA. Time to stop reminding him, and just shut off and shut down your pc at 5. He clearly does not respect your boundaries, so he does know where they are.", "Sounds like a pretty good corporate gig...quiting early typically means giving up on packages / acrued bonuses."]}
