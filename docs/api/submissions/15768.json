I said yes so we made plans to go the next day. I was pretty excited because i hadn\u2019t really spoken to her in a few months and i was looking forward to catching up.I picked her up around noon.\n\nWe went to a bookstore first, where i noticed that she was only browsing the discount shelves. I told her that if she wanted to save her money for the next store then i would be fine buying her some. I know that my aunt\u2019s family isn\u2019t doing so well lately, which meant that she probably hadn\u2019t given cousin much spending money. She lit up and picked out a couple books. When we went to check out, i noticed that they had a really good sale going so i let her get a few more (about 9 total). I even signed up for the membership so that she\u2019d be able to use it and save a bit more money. \n\nThen we went to mall and that\u2019s when i noticed a little problem. She was sort of running around tossing anything that caught her interest into the wagon. I was a bit worried that she still didn\u2019t really understand the value of money and i didn\u2019t want her to be upset when she realized that she wasn\u2019t going to have enough. So i went up to her and asked \u201chow much money did your mom send you out with? i wanna make sure you can get all this.\u201d She responded with \u201cMa only sent me out with five dollars, she said to just have you pay for whatever i want. \u201d As soon as she said that i took the wagon from her and started scanning everything so that i could see how much she wanted me to spend. Almost $500. \n\nWhen i saw the price i  went and started putting everything away while she was crying. She started going on and on about how her mom had promised her all this stuff and that i was being a stupid ugly bully. I told her she could take a picture of everything she wanted so she could have her mom get it. After i was done, we hopped back into the car and i took her home. When we got to her house she ran to her room with her books and locked herself in there. My aunt started yelling at me asking what the fuck i did to her daughter. I told her that i didn\u2019t appreciate that she told her daughter that she could spend my money however she wanted. She started saying that if i invite someone out then its my job to pay but 1. no the fuck it\u2019s not and 2. cousin asked ME to go shopping, she invited ME out. Then she said that it was the least that i could do for her because her and her family are struggling while i\u2019m just sitting on my \u201ccripple money\u201d (my disability benefits). When she said that i felt so hurt and i knew i was going to start crying, so i told her that i would no longer be picking up her son (7) from school and am done babysitting him on the weekends, then got in my car and left.\n\nMost of our family + friends took her side and basically said that i was being an insensitive asshole for not helping them monetarily during hard times. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682542735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zzh6u/aita_for_not_buying_stuff_for_my_cousin/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously your aunt is the AH for telling her daughter you\u2019d buy her whatever she wanted without talking to you, and even making that assumption to begin with.  Also, you\u2019re 19.

Your aunt is Queen AH of AITA.\n\nAnd her loyal subjects telling you you\u2019re in the wrong are just plain wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to buy your cousin things. And if your aunt feels so entitled to your time and money, and throws in ableist comments to boot, then no longer babysitting for her is the right call. I\u2019d block her entirely.", "NTA- i am proud if you for standing your ground and you did the right thing. Maybe she will realize what she has said and done. Did you mention the $500 amount that she was trying to spend as she ran with the 9 books to her room? There shouldve been a spending limit in place before this trip ever got started. She shouldve never promised her daughter your money and that was way over the top. And then had the audacity to send her out with $5 and not even at least $20? Insane. She is TA. Not you. There is a difference between helping out and being used!", "NTA - Remind your family and anyone calling you the AH that it is not your responsibility to provide for others.", "You are absolutely NTA.

Try telling them what really happened and see if their tune changes.  If it doesn\u2019t, then they\u2019re just as crazy as she is, so you don\u2019t need to worry about their opinions.", "NTA You were helpful at the bookstore. Something tells me you might have helpful if she hadn't racked the bill up to $500. It was pretty presumptuous of her mother to tell her you would pay for everything without even consulting you first.", "NTA. Cousin invited you, not vice versa. So by your aunts logic, your cousin should have been the one paying for everything. You were very kind to buy her the books. Expecting you to spend $500+ on all those \u201cwants\u201d is is an entirely different matter. And it is never ok to make a promise on behalf of someone else.", "NTA wowza your \u201cfamily\u201d are a bunch in insensitive ah and the financial troubles re what they deserve. Block them all and keep your $ and time to yourself..", "I\u2019m shocked at the aunt. I\u2019m not sure why she thinks she is entitled to OP\u2019s money. She\u2019s the parent and should be providing for her own children. If she thinks that OP has it so easy, she needs to try living with the limitations OP does. And not just for a few days.", "NTA and any family member who says you\u2019re being selfish let them joke you\u2019ll tell your cousin they\u2019ll take he shopping for all the clothes.", "NTA, I am so sorry you have to deal with these kinds of people", "NTA Did the rest of the family hear your side of the story or are they going off some biased explanation from your aunt? Do they know you bought her books? I can't imagine that all of them would take her side if they heard that she A) wanted you to spend $500 and B) called you a cripple. THEY wouldn't spend $500 on her!\n\nI hope they just don't know the whole story, but if they do know the whole story, you're probably better off going LC.", "NTA- that's emotional manipulation. Keep strong. Those benefits are for you. Not for them and it's not your job to take care of a grown woman and her kids.

Ask the family members who are mad at you to contribute 500$ to the family.", "NTA, I am guessing that she does not pay you for picking up her son or babysitting.  Then to call it your cripple money.  That is what you are to live off of.  She needs to get off her ass and figure out how to make ends meet.  As for the family, if you still have photos send them on and say you do not have enough \"Cripple money\" so they need to step up and spend $500.

I take my niece and nephew out for their birthdays so they can buy the present they want and spend maybe $120 tops...and that's for their birthday ..not just a random shopping trip.  Sometimes they don't even spend all of the amount and they are comfortable with that ...not demanding more.
