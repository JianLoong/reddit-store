My mother also received her own monthly check and so did my brother. During this time my parents went through a separation and I moved from Maryland to New York with my mother while my brother stayed in Maryland with my dad to finish school. I started receiving the checks in 7th grade for $1,000 a month for my future/college/personal needs. My father also paid my mother monthly payments for me so all the checks could be saved until I stopped receiving them at 18. My mother also worked two jobs. A couple years later my father and mother ended up getting back together and have been ever since so I never needed any of the money from the checks for anything other than my future. Fast forward to when I turn 18. My father tells my mother to give me the account with all my money that has accumulated from 7th grade through high school until I was 18. I told him I wanted her to invest it and put it away for ten years so I wouldn\u2019t blow it and at 28 I could maturely use this money and I\u2019d never seen my father so proud of me. I received an account at 28yo with only 12k. That\u2019s only 12 months worth of checks. I\u2019m missing over 35k of checks Plus I\u2019m missing ten years of interest and whatever I would of made putting it in CD\u2019s. I lost my shit. My father has begged me for the last four Years not to report her for stealing all that money but since I was 28 I\u2019ve never looked at her the same and Have so much anger and resentment towards her. She stole so much from me and my future. I was depending on that money to travel, buy a home, new car. I honestly want to report her to the social security administration and police even though she\u2019s my mother. I can\u2019t even look at her without feeling so hurt, betrayed, and on top of that having my father tell me not to. Basically calling me an asshole for even thinking about reporting her.

Forgot to mention she blew it on alcohol and lottery tickets.", "My mother had to oversee the account until I was 18. At 18 I made the choice to put it all in CD\u2019s for ten years to grow interest. I have all the emails from her saying it was put in CD\u2019s. All $47,509.88. At 28 I got an account with 12,663.41. I have everything showing she not only lied about putting it into those CD\u2019s but went to the bank and got the whole account history starting from the first withdraw she made until the last one a day before my 28th birthday. In those emails she tells me it\u2019s all in CD\u2019s and safe. And for ten years lied and spent my money on alcohol and lottery tickets.

She had her own money to blow. What about your brother\u2019s? Did she stole that too? \n\nI know a couple of selfish mothers (My friends\u2019) Its so hard to see how they can only think of themselves. Worst part is, none of my two friends can see just how selfish their mothers are. They grew up like that and believe it to be normal and okay.", "Nope. Report her.", "Well then. I don't think you're an AH for wanting to turn her in, and since you have actual proof, do as you need.\n\nPersonally I think I'd just go no contact with her and leave her in the anxiety of you possibly sueing her. Because it seems unlikely that you'll get anything from her other than a headache. \n\nAnd make a will. If you get flattened while crossing the street, you don't want her to be able to claim the rest of your money.", "No my brother had my dad manage his account until he was 18 and after watching him blow it all in two years, when I turned 18 that\u2019s what made me decide to invest it. She blew all her money, plus the two checks she was getting every week from her two jobs and the $35+k she stole from me. And blew the 50k my dad gave her to move to NY with.

Your father is too involved in the situation to give advise. He just wants to sweep it all under the carpet.", "NTA! She stole from you, one way or another, she needs to pay for this crime.", "She might have used it to support you all those years ago. You need to find out what she used it on.

If a parent can save it, great. But if they cannot, they can spend it on the child\u2019s expenses. Your mom will just say she spent the money on your expenses. Anyone can sue someone, though, so see a lawyer. The lawyer will tell you if you have a case. The first consultation is usually free.

She used the card to pay for bar tabs and all the withdrawals were made to pay for lottery tickets. Every time the card was ran it was at the bar. None of it was spent on Me. Plus I\u2019ve worked since I was 16 and paid for all my own bills, clothes, etc.", "She also got her own monthly checks like I did. On top of what my dad gave her. Plus her two checks from her jobs.

Have him sign a contract with a payment schedule. Have a lawyer draw up the contract so it can be legally defended. If dad won\u2019t agree then report mom to the authorities. But, what about mom? Have you made any demands of her? \n\nMom saying you are \u201coverreacting\u201d is infuriating. In fact, 35 thousand dollars of fury. Do your parents have homeownership? That is an asset that would be in jeopardy if the legal authorities get involved in your mother\u2019s theft crime. I\u2019m sure an attorney can put facts like these in a demand letter to your mother\u2026and your father? Perhaps he too has some culpability here.\n\nOP, don\u2019t let them continue to victimize you.", "ESH, you for telling another adult to do what you could have easily done for yourself.  Your mom, well for being a lying thief.  Report her if YOU want, but YOU should have taken YOUR money when offered and YOU should have invested it.", "ESH This is a tough one. I'd be angry about my money too but are you really comfortable potentially putting your own mother In prison? That's HUGE. Is there no other way to resolve this?", "For the posters who recommend suing mom. Be aware that 35K is not a lot of money when it comes to a lawsuit. Lawyer\u2019s fees would take a big bite out of it IF mom paid the settlement in OP\u2019s favor.\n\nI think threatening a fraud/criminal complaint would possibly reap more benefit for OP. Losing a lawsuit pales in comparison to being convicted of a crime with a possible jail sentence. But don\u2019t just threat. Do. I think there would be a likely guilty plea from mom, probation, and a judgement demanding she pay back what she stole. And, she would be kept on probation until OP\u2019s loss was repaid.", "His father paid her child support.

Going to the police won't help, you actually need to hire an attorney.", "She worked two jobs. Does that sound like it was enough to live on?

I'm not familiar with US law but in my country fraud as big as 35k could land you a prison sentence. Just thought it was worth considering how severe the punishment could be before acting out of upset.", "NTA. Please sue her and I am so sorry you are going through this. I would also go No Contact with your parents.", "Except YOU didn't invest it.  YOU left it the hands of your mom to do so.  Take some responsibility.  Go NC with your mom and dad and get on with life.", "Of course it does.  It was her money.  She should have taken all of it and invested it with an investment company.  Sure they would have charged her a commission, but they wouldn't have stolen it all.   ALWAYS pay attention to your OWN money.  NEVER leave to family or friends to manage."]}
