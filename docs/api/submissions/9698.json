My mother also received her own monthly check and so did my brother. During this time my parents went through a separation and I moved from Maryland to New York with my mother while my brother stayed in Maryland with my dad to finish school. I started receiving the checks in 7th grade for $1,000 a month for my future/college/personal needs. My father also paid my mother monthly payments for me so all the checks could be saved until I stopped receiving them at 18. My mother also worked two jobs. A couple years later my father and mother ended up getting back together and have been ever since so I never needed any of the money from the checks for anything other than my future. Fast forward to when I turn 18. My father tells my mother to give me the account with all my money that has accumulated from 7th grade through high school until I was 18. I told him I wanted her to invest it and put it away for ten years so I wouldn\u2019t blow it and at 28 I could maturely use this money and I\u2019d never seen my father so proud of me. I received an account at 28yo with only 12k. That\u2019s only 12 months worth of checks. I\u2019m missing over 35k of checks Plus I\u2019m missing ten years of interest and whatever I would of made putting it in CD\u2019s. I lost my shit. My father has begged me for the last four Years not to report her for stealing all that money but since I was 28 I\u2019ve never looked at her the same and Have so much anger and resentment towards her. She stole so much from me and my future. I was depending on that money to travel, buy a home, new car. I honestly want to report her to the social security administration and police even though she\u2019s my mother. I can\u2019t even look at her without feeling so hurt, betrayed, and on top of that having my father tell me not to. Basically calling me an asshole for even thinking about reporting her.

At 18 I made the choice to put it all in CD\u2019s for ten years to grow interest. I have all the emails from her saying it was put in CD\u2019s. All $47,509.88. At 28 I got an account with 12,663.41. I have everything showing she not only lied about putting it into those CD\u2019s but went to the bank and got the whole account history starting from the first withdraw she made until the last one a day before my 28th birthday. In those emails she tells me it\u2019s all in CD\u2019s and safe. And for ten years lied and spent my money on alcohol and lottery tickets.

I don't think you're an AH for wanting to turn her in, and since you have actual proof, do as you need.\n\nPersonally I think I'd just go no contact with her and leave her in the anxiety of you possibly sueing her. Because it seems unlikely that you'll get anything from her other than a headache. \n\nAnd make a will.

She blew all her money, plus the two checks she was getting every week from her two jobs and the $35+k she stole from me. And blew the 50k my dad gave her to move to NY with. Only put 25k down on the house so she could spend the rest."]}
