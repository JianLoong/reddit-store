I am sorry that promise didn't come to fruition in the way you expected.\n\nIf you intend to go the legal route, you may have an argument that after you turned 18 there was a verbal agreement to put the saved money into investments.

Income taxes will also be paid in the kids' names. Each check is supposed to be spent in its entirety each month. Records are supposed to be kept where the money went. If the kid gets audited (one of my 4 did), you need to show it was all used. It's not supposed to be saved or invested or used for college. The notice that came with my kids' audit request said that any funds that were saved or not used appropriately would have to be repaid.", "Came here to say this.  This makes no sense. Disabled veterans get money from the VA not SSDI is true. The amount is determined by disability rating and dependents. And it goes to the veteran. None of this or the amounts  make sense.

I'm not entirely sure what the laws on receiving social security on behalf of a kid were back when you were  younger. I can say about 9 years ago, my younger kids were able to collect it due to having a disabled parent. There were rules that stated that the money HAD to be used for care (food, housing, utilities, clothing, sports, leisure activities, etc.) and could NOT be saved as a college fund or invested. All money spent had to be documented, and the documentation had to be available for an audit if requested. We even received examples on how to determine how to divide housing costs up between the household. Out of 6 kids, 2 were too old to qualify at the time of the disability and 4 received benefits. Of the 4 that received the benefits, only 1 got audited (the 2nd to youngest). One was able to use their money for tuition as they were 17 when they graduated high school, and the entirety was spent for the month on the payment. \n\nI dont know if you would be able to get any of it back, or what the statute of limitations is on not having the documentation to show where the money was spent (in order for her to be held accountable of a financial crime) but it could be worth looking into.", "Still, consult with a lawyer.

It was used to house and feed our family and to keep the utilities going.  I do not know the legalities of the money.  My brothers never expected to have any of it given to them. Perhaps they should have.  kt", "NTA, report her", "So your family thinks you\u2019d be the asshole for reporting her. Do they a goddamn word to say about your mother stealing a significant amount of money from her own child? Seriously?\n\nNTA. Get your money back.", "YTA for not reporting her immediately.", "I have never heard anything like this ...", "Read the follow ups on some Of the comments I answered. Jesus. My mother worked two jobs to keep a roof over my head? My father paid every single bill this house had, cell phone payments, etc. my mother worked two jobs to keep her alcoholism and gambling addictions fed. She too got monthly checks like I did and blew those too. Plus the allowance my dad gave her monthly and her two checks.", "I\u2019m confused. Yea you\u2019re NTA and ur mom\u2019s a bum. But social security money is allowed to be spent on child expenses until ur 18. I understand she agreed to not spend it but it doesn\u2019t sound like u have a case. Who told u did have a legal case? I\u2019d be interested to know. U might be able to sue her but if she doesn\u2019t have anything it will cost more than it\u2019s worth.", "Leave witches out of this, there was no magic involved", "As a child.", "Report her.  I bet you discussed what you were going to do with that money, and she let you think it was all there, ready and waiting for you. \nReport her.\nNTA, but she is.", "NTA. Contact a lawyer and sue. And then give us an update", "NTA. \n\nI love how people in the wrong always say someone is overreacting. \n\nWhat she did is theft, plain and simple. If it's not such a big deal, then ask them how they are going to pay you back. \n\nI'm so angry on your behalf.", "NTA Report her.", "Your mother worked two job you don\u2019t know about the house expenses maybe she used it for that YTA", "I don't think you're going to get very far because the money from social security was to be used to provide for your needs since your father was disabled. It wasn't being given to you for future or college needs. \n\nIf the money never was actually given to you, or wasn't in an account with your name on it and under your control, you won't be able to prove that the money wasn't used as it was intended - to help fund your food, clothing, and housing needs between the ages of 12 and 18.", "NTA.  WE want you to sue her for the money, because WE all paid into that shit for you!  She's a thief and a monster of a mother.", "Nta. Report her. That's absolutely appalling. Bye forever mom. Sue for it all", "NTA tell her and your father they either pay the money back or you take them to court.", "NTA, I\u2019m sorry you got stabbed by someone who should\u2019ve unconditionally backed you. HOWEVER, I\u2019d ask your dad if your mom even has money to pay you back at all. If you sue and undergo an expensive legal process but she doesn\u2019t have the funds to pay up, it\u2019d do no good to you", "Y W B T A if you did not call the police. She committed a crime.", "Hehehe. Came to say this!", "NTA. Get a lawyer asap because there's statute of limitation of things. You've known for years and the time could have started ticking from that day.", "NTA. Report her.", "NTA. Your mother oehhhhh all she is allowed to do now is sit in a corner, be quiet and hope you will forgive her. She should be on her knees. Her having the Audacity to guilt you or make you feel wrong..when she does that she forgets she will fuel your anger.", "Info: So you are 32 years old now, and when you turned 18 fourteen years ago your dad told your mother to give you the account. Time jumps and suddenly you're 28 and being given the account for the first time. You notice it's missing over $30,000 at that point. Now four years later you're considering finally telling someone about the fraud?\n\nYour timeline makes no sense. If this is real, you need to check the statute of limitations for this situation because you might have already waited way too long.", "So technically those checks (if they were from SSDI) were hers for raising you while growing up. She could have used them for anything and in most cases it\u2019s a form of child support. The only checks you are legally entitled to are if you were 18 and still in high school. So I honestly see this going nowhere and they will tell you that money was for raising you.", "The amount isn't petty theft or small claims either. A lawyer will jump at the chance to take OP's case if they want to try to get the stolen money back. Or at least some sort of monetary compensation returned.", "Former SSA employee. You are correct. \n\nOP can contact SSA at 1-800-772-1213 for specific information about their benefits.

The money was still meant for her to spend on supporting you. You won\u2019t have a leg to stand on to try and claim she committed fraud.", "Hug! We know!", "NTA and it stinks to not have the money you were counting on, but I\u2019m not sure you could successfully sue. The money from SSA to you as an auxiliary beneficiary is for your care. I\u2019m sure she could argue (whether factual or not) that the money supplied you food, shelter, clothing, school items, medical care etc. \n\nI am sorry you tried to be so mature and set yourself up for success while your mother wasn\u2019t pulling her weight in that department as far as the verbal agreement was for the money.", "NTA. Do what you feel is necessary.", "Sue her!!!!! My best friends grandma (who had custody of her after her parents passed) took every dime of the survivors benefits she got from age 2 to 18 and spent it on dumb shit she can\u2019t do anything about it because her mom is so far in debt from her horrible spending habits she wasted about 40k and only used a small portion on my friend when she was younger by buying her some clothes and sometimes paying for school stuff like year books or field trips. That was your money and your mom robbed you of 35k you wouldn\u2019t think twice about suing some random person if they stole that much you mom should not be an exception.", "NTA but id talk to a lawyer to see what the possible outcome would be and how long the process. Figure out if it\u2019s worth it from there.\n\nI\u2019m also curious what she used the money for? If it was for basic living expenses then\u2026. Yes it really sucks but I feel for her. If it was just fun money then that\u2019s shit.\n\nIt could be a really long process and might not be worth it emotionally. Could impact your relationship with other family members too.", "Check your credit reports. She may have also opened credit cards in your name.", "If a person is on SSDI and has dependents then they can qualify for a check for each child. Anywhere from 0-50% of your check it all depends on what your family max is. Say a person gets 2500 a month the family max could be 1250 to be split between all the kids you have. So if you have 3 kids they would each get around 416. Although her and her brother get 1000 each doesn\u2019t make any sense unless she\u2019s adding VA benefits into that amount. As the max amount you can get on SSDI 3627 a month and that would make 1813 for the family max and 906 a month per child. And these are based on today calculations which means it would have been a lot lower as a child because you would need to subtract all the COLAS that have made it these amounts. So this smells fishy, I\u2019m on SSDI and admin groups that help people with their claims and questions.", "Thank you. OP was never entitled to $40k. He was entitled to food and housing and clothes and medical care and extracurriculars paid for with that money (and if mom was working 2 jobs, that money was used for their care and then some). They are MAYBE entitled to what was put in the CD at 18, IF it was in their name, but that\u2019s not even clear here because mom wouldn\u2019t have been able to take money out of \u201chis\u201d account. Also, it\u2019s been like 6 years since the \u201ctheft,\u201d and the statute of limitations is either expired or damn near about to. \n\nOP can see a lawyer or report mom to SSA, but they will tell him the same thing.", "It really doesn't matter what her other sources of income were.  The money was intended for her to use to take care of you growing up and wasn't yours, even if it was issued with your name.  If there was any fraud, it's that she was collecting money that she didn't need because she had enough other income but even that's doubtful.  No one you report this to is going to see it as her stealing your money.", "I mean, she did make the money disappear \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
