The thought he put into this is minimal. You were polite in saying it wasn't something you'd use and didn't engage in an argument, I think your reaction was understandable and appropriate.\n\n(my husband just re-gifted some Starbucks cards (given to him at Christmas) to my daughter for her birthday.  She doesn't drink coffee, or even hot drinks, really.  And she's disabled and doesn't leave her house much.  Did he put any thought into the gift?  Yeah, he probably thought, as he left for the party, \"I'd better stuff something in this card.\"  An empty card with good wishes would have been better.", "I'm trying to understand this a little better.  Let's say some other person (co-worker, classmate, friend, etc.) gave you a gift you didn't really want.  Would your reaction be to tell them to their face that you don't want it/need it?  I have been socially conditioned to regard that as a rude/insensitive reaction, and to simply say thanks, then re-gift/donate the item to someone else who would appreciate the item more.  The fact that it's your dad giving you unwanted gifts doesn't speak well to how well he knows your interests, but it still seems harsh that you would react negatively with your dad, but a different way with other people.  Almost like you feel entitled to treat your dad like a punching bag.  BTW, I have exactly 0 kids, so it's not like I am automatically taking you dad's side just because he's the parent in this story.", "Let me reframe what happened for you:\n\nYour dad was on a trip with your mom. That is *not* a typical gift-giving situation, so you should not have expected any gift at all. *If* someone gives a gift in a situation like that, it's almost always souvenir or a result of the thought process \"I just happened to see this item and it reminded me of you.\"\n\nIn other words, your father was not going on a shopping trip *for you*. He was not seeking out a present specifically for your tastes (so he wouldn't have been looking at your list), he was just out and about for himself.\n\nAnd while he was out on a trip for himself, he happened to see an item that reminded him of a conversation you and he had had a year ago. That makes this an incredibly thoughtful gift, regardless of whether you \"have a use case\" for it.\n\nThe correct response to a non-offensive gift is, \"Thank you.\" No \"buts,\" just \"Thank you.\" You have no obligation to be effusive or to fall all over yourself thanking them, just be polite and accept the gift in the manner in which it was intended, regardless of whether you think you have a use for it. (I specify \"non-offensive\" gifts because there absolutely are cases where the gift itself displays offensive intentions or is otherwise inappropriate... In those cases, it makes sense to reject them)\n\nSo while I don't believe you had bad intentions, yes YTA.\n\nI'll leave you with one caveat and one thought\n\nThe caveat: if your father routinely buys you gifts you do not want and you have requested that he stop getting you gifts like that, your reaction makes more sense\n\nThe thought: I realize that this is just a snippet of your life and that you had to tell your story while paying attention to character counts, but my immediate thought was wondering if you struggle with social conventions/interactions/cues regularly. If so, you may want to consider if you could have something like ADHD or be on the autism spectrum", "YTA: If you get insulted by the nice gestures in your life, how will you ever be happy? Your dad is angry because even when he's trying to be kind he still can't win with you. Even if it was a thoughtless gift, your reaction was still inappropriate.\n\nI get it, your dad probably does seem out of touch with your interests. But I would suggest putting some positive energy into how you could be closer and share more instead of pushing him away and rejecting his attempts to show he cares.", ">I told them a year ago that I admire my friend teaching himself Japanese even tho we attend a challenging school and I didn't know how he had time for that.\n\nYTA. And you're still thinking the Japanese book is completely out of left field? Maybe your Dad isn't the greatest gift-chooser in the world, but you're definitely a rude recipient.", "YTA - I once got gifted a self help book it was not useful then but was useful after three years. He even remembered what you said a year ago just say thankyou and accept it", "YTA\n\nYou were rude for no reason.\n\nYes, the gift could have been more thoughtful. It sounds like you may have bigger issues worth your parents as well.\n\nWhen someone gets you a gift for a random occasion, just say thank you. You don\u2019t owe them anything but politeness", "YTA. You owe your dad an apology. \n\nIt sounds like you are bitter that they left you and brother home instead of bringing you along. \n\nHealthy parents spend time and take trips together without the kids. You have to accept that. They are being a good role model so you know how to spend time without kids to connect with your partner (if you choose to in the future). \n\nYou are using the gift to push your dad's buttons, but what you are really upset about is they left you home with your brother. \n\nI wish I could charge you money for my advice, because you are too bratty and selfish to deserve it for free.\n\nBut, since I'm not charging you, my advice is a thoughtful gift, and we know you hate most of those, so there is some consolation for me.", "NTA, big time. Some parents feel bad that they don't spend as much time with their kids as they should, and they think the solution is to buy the kids stuff. If you're completely clueless what your kid actually wants even though they gave you a physical list of possibilities, then you're TA, not the kid. Clearly, and contrary to what others are saying here, Dad *didn't* put much thought into it.", "YTA. Hun, it was an unexpected gift. You're an adult. Like, where is the question here for you?", "YTA. For starters you should always try to act grateful for a gift unless it's truely offensive. They tried to put time, thought, and l/or money into it. Even if you don't like it, fake it.\n\nSecond though, he remembered a conservation from a year ago. That shows a lot more effort than many people give.", "Soft YTA.  You weren't rude in how you explained the gift wasn't something you would've wanted, but you should've just said thank you, then put the book on your shelf somewhere and let it collect dust", "NTA your father just shows that he knows nothing about you or your interests.", "YTA - When someone gives you a gift, just say \u201cthank you!\u201d", "YTA. You act like you can\u2019t say \u201cthank you\u201d and leave it be. Hell, just open the damn book and you just might be surprised and change your mind. You\u2019re 19? You should know by now not everything is about you at every waking moment. You say you never stated you wanted to learn that language but for SOME reason they recall you admiring someone for doing that very thing. They thought about you, don\u2019t act like they didn\u2019t. YTA.", "YTA. Just take the present and move on. If you want to prevent the possibility of getting more Japanese related stuff in the future, at a separate time, you can have a discussion along the lines of \"You know, after working through that book you got me, I think I'm going to drop that project and go a different route. That didn't turn out how I was expecting.\"", "YTA for your bad manners -- as others are saying, take the god damn gift. But on the other hand, no one's saying you should learn Japanese. Instead of making him feel like an ass (and making yourself an ass in the process), find a time and a place to gently tell him so he can return it and get his money back.", "NTA - sounds like this is one in a long list of instances where your father has shown how little he knows you. You were polite in saying you had no use for it and his behavior since shows how narcissistic and emotionally immature your father is. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to be raised by people like that and it\u2019s even harder to draw emotional boundaries with them. Good luck as you transition into adulthood and hopefully move into your own place!", "YTA\n\nYou may had the interest to learn Japanese 1 year ago and lost interest later on, but does that mean that you wont get the interest back one day later on in the future?\n\nAre you not happy that while he didn't buy the book back then, that he still remembered that 1 year later and bought it for you?\n\nBetter question is if you're really sure that you wont get back the desire to read and learn Japanese one day in the future? This way you have the book right there and then, ready for usage if you so desire for it one day for one reason or another!!", "YTA. Your dad bought you a gift based on an interest you had expressed (and that he remembered!) from a year prior. And guess what, your dad bought you a gift to learn something - which means he admires your intelligence and thinks you too like to learn things for reasons besides the demands of school, he is proud of you.\n\nBuying a gift card or something from your wish list isn't actually very thoughtful, and is a transactional gift. In the future when you can afford to buy things for yourself, you will come to appreciate more intuitively that a gift someone else chooses carries a lot more meaning than a gift you have picked out for them to buy. Once you can buy the things you want for yourself, the utility of a gift starts to mean a lot less than the thought put into it and what it means that they would have selected it for you.", "NTA. Folks aren't reading your post entirely, OP. They seem to be missing the section wherein you state you didn't receive a Christmas present at all. Is this true??\n\nSounds like he's embarrassed that his present didn't hit the way he thought it would and is gaslighting you to deflect the embarrassment.\n\nEdit:typo", "YTA.  Gifts are not obligations.  Period.", "NTA. The gift was thoughtful. Of your friend. You weren\u2019t considered at all.", "Your dad remembered something you said you admired a year ago and followed up on it. That is lovely, and YTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s unfair to put someone in a position where they have to be grateful for something they didn\u2019t ask for, I\u2019m surprised more people don\u2019t understand something so simple. Admiring someone being able to make time for something and being interested in that something itself are completely different and your father should know enough about his son to get you something you\u2019ve at least mentioned in the current YEAR. He showed that he didn\u2019t, you\u2019re not wrong to be upset by that.", "You better get him that Russian book next gift giving holiday", "NTA. A gift given without thought is just a token gesture that only requires a token thank you.", "I'm in the middle on this for the most part. Where I start to lean is the idea that this is one activity on the back of many others where you've been disappointed, and this time it finally came out. I'm going with NTA because of that, although it does sound like there was at least a kernel of thought that you might be interested in Japanese because of what you said. On the other hand, just because you admire someone for something doesn't mean you want to do it as well. Those are NOT the same thing.", "NTA 100%!  When I was growing up, I preferred cookie cakes while my brother liked ice cream cakes.  Guess what kind of cake I got every year for my birthday?  They would also give me presents that were really just for them; like my mom would get body wash etc products that she knew I would never use.  I don\u2019t know which is better, getting a gift meant for the person who bought the gift, or not getting anything at all.", "I gotta go with NTA.\n\nMy father and I have a horrible relationship. It can be said that I do nothing to better the relationship because I don\u2019t, neither does he. But what he will do is give me something and expect me to jump over the moon with a joy and gratitude no matter what it is even if it is something I have clearly and many times told him I do not have any interest in. \nMany times I have tried to tell him to stop and he gets mad at me because I am being ungrateful for receiving something I don\u2019t want. \nEveryone here is saying that you are an ass because you should just shut up and except the gift but I\u2019m sorry we are not obligated to just be happy anytime someone gives us something. If it\u2019s something we don\u2019t want, especially from a family member we expect more from, we have the right to be upset about it. Seems like the victim blaming it to me when someone receive something they don\u2019t want and just forced to be happy about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So being \u201cdisappointed\u201d in their father for such a thing seems a bit harsh. \n\nThere can always be more to a story than we are shown here, but a well intended gift that harms nothing should not be treated with callousness is my thought.", "They just said their HUSBAND.", "What's your point?

When a friend who knows I like candy picked me up some hazelnut treats, I shared them around with my game group because I don\u2019t do hazelnuts myself but I recognized the kind gesture. And when I gave a friend a craft I\u2019d made, they accepted it in the spirit it was intended and, since it wasn\u2019t of real use to them, they passed it along to their daughter, who now uses it as a rug in her dollhouse. \n\nA gift kindly intended is just that, is what I\u2019m saying.
