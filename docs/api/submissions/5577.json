They don't ask about her, they don't acknowledge her birthday, or Christmas and it's very clear they want nothing to do with her. Their loss entirely. \n\nIssue is, I come from a big family. My mom is one of 12. So growing up, I always had cousins around. I do have 2 nieces (9f, 13f) and an extremely handicapped nephew (15m), but they're so far apart in age, I don't feel like my daughter will have the same experience growing up.\n\nMy dad is an only child, and I do not know any of my extended family on my Dad's side. My own grandfather has never acknowledged my sister and I... Let alone any of our kids. So my kiddo has me, my sister, my parents, her 3 cousins and my paternal grandmother (my mom only speaks to two of her living siblings and I'm no longer close to any of my cousins).\n\nMy ex is pretty adamant that he has no interest in finding his biological parents, and of course I would respect his wishes if he doesn't want anything to do with them, but I would like to meet them and allow my daughter to meet any aunties and uncles and cousins she might have from her dad's side of the family. If for no reason other than knowing their medical histories.\n\nWIBTA if I got one of those ancestors tests and tried to track down my ex's bio family?\n\nETA: There are so many people here making half-assed assumptions. \n\nFor more context: his bio dad contested the adoption, but his adoptive parents threw their money around until he couldn't afford to fight anymore. That came straight out of his mother's mouth.\n\nHe doesn't see adoption as a trauma, just a fact of life for him. He's not close at all with his adoptive family, so I don't even think he understands the dynamics of actually being a part of one. \n\nWe've talked about this before and while he personally has no interest in seeking them out, he has never once said he didn't want me to. He said it was more or less my choice if I wanted to try to find them. So I'm not even asking in the context of betraying my ex or hurting him. He. Doesn't. Care.\n\nI'm just aware that it could potentially affect the lives of many people and I'm not trying to blow anyone's life up--i just want my child to know where she comes from genetically, because i'm living in her shoes. I know what it's like  to have only half of a family full of  dysfunction and generational trauma.

It feels cruel and selfish.\n\nIf it\u2019s so important try asking him if he\u2019d be ok with that, if yes go on, if no then stop right there", "YTA. Absolutely not. As an adopted child, if my partner or ex partner ever contacted my biological family without consent, I\u2019d be LIVID. Like scorched earth livid. Your ex already said he has no interest in them.

That\u2019s on you. \n\nThis is incredibly misguided and irresponsibly optimistic.", "Wow!  This could really blow up in your face.

You aren't doing this for medical reasons, that I could understand.  You are doing this because of something you want.  Your child can be perfectly happy with a small family, as well as building friendships that become your family.  This would be a complete violation to your ex and would permanently damage your relationship and cause him unnecessary harm.  If he ever wants to find his bio parents, that should be HIS choice.", "You need to back off of this, and discuss this with your ex, before doing anything.

I'm adopted, I had no interest in finding my biological family, and my husband and I argued about it a lot. I would be furious if someone went behind my back and found them. (It's a moot point now, because bio family found me instead, the jackasses.)  Do not do this. It is NOT your place. YTA", "YTA you are doing it for selfish reasons. You want your child to grow up in some idyllic world with lots of family. And yet, if family was so important why aren\u2019t you still close with all those cousins you grew up with? Rather than dreaming of her living your childhood, why don\u2019t you work to make her childhood good for her without overstepping your bounds? Family isn\u2019t just blood. Build a family right there in your community.", "YTA 100%. Do not do this, it almost certainly will not end well or the way you hope.", "YTA - this is not appropriate because they are going to want to know about their son. That is IF they even want to be found. And it doesn\u2019t sound like he wants anything to do with them. Then invariably you\u2019re going to start talking about him in conversation, telling them things that he may not want you to share. It\u2019s his private life and you have NO business sharing ANY information about him. There\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019re good people. You could open yourself and your ex up to more trouble than its worth. And without giving them any info about their son, I see no reason why they\u2019d want to continue a relationship. I wouldn\u2019t. In fact I\u2019d find it odd and kinda creepy and I\u2019d assume that you\u2019re looking for money. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s just weird and disrespectful to go behind his back and open that communication when he doesn\u2019t want it. I would be pissed if I was him.       \nHow do you think this is going to go? Your child isn\u2019t even their kid. Yes they might be interested in their own son, but without that connection I doubt they would be as welcoming. At least not to the extent you are seeking. \n\nFurthermore, you said you have cousins you\u2019ve lost touch with. Well why don\u2019t *you* rekindle those relationships?! Even if your mom doesn\u2019t speak to any of her siblings you can still rekindle a relationship with your cousins. At least it\u2019s your own family! You\u2019re using this excuse that you grew up in a big family as a reason to insert yourself into these stranger\u2019s lives when you have 11 other uncles and aunts around with kids that you don\u2019t talk to. And if you can\u2019t talk to these people then why is that? You have your dad\u2019s side who doesn\u2019t talk to your family, and your mom only talks to 2 of her siblings out 10\u2026\u2026\u2026.         \nSorry, but this seems like your family is the common denominator here and that makes me suspicious that your family is the problem. I feel like there is a lot of drama buried in your family dynamics. And now you want to start some drama by going behind your ex\u2019s back and find his bio parents because you think they can provide a bigger family for your 2.5 yr old daughter?? Just don\u2019t. Your child doesn\u2019t need them and neither do you. Unless your ex wants to reach out, it\u2019s none of your business.", "YTA and you need therapy . Only an selfish person would do something like this. Get help for yourself so you can come to terms on how to raise your child as a single parent. You are not doing anything positive for your child with this selfish thinking.", "YTA. This is a major boundary violation for your ex. \n\nIt is great you want your daughter to have a good childhood, but this is barking up the wrong tree. You can\u2019t create cousins she doesn\u2019t have, or make familial bonds appear over shared DNA even if (Biig Iif) these people want to connect.\n\nInstead you can create a found family and friends network. Join parenting groups. Host events for kids your daughter\u2019s age. Enroll her in activities she enjoys and encourage her to meet people her own age.\n\nEven if she did have the cousins you had, your own situation shows that family can scatter as life comes and goes. But teaching her and encouraging her to find likeminded people and make her own community will mean she won\u2019t be alone, and neither will you.", "Yes. YWBTA. It is HIS family. HIS choice. Do not ever go behind someone's back. You can't keep this a secret from him anyway and it's wrong. Don't even figure out their names. It's not your business.", "YTA\n\nThe *only reason* you should be contacting those bio parents is for medical records, if those are not available.", "YTA. He\u2019s not interested and you want your child to have the large, happy family experience you did. He set a boundary when he told you that. \n\nWhat you want to do is driven by fantasies and selfishness. \n\nWhy potentially open up old wounds for his biological father? Or your ex? The potential to cause a lot of pain to people outweighs your need for the big happy family.", "I\u2019d say yes. YWBTA. \n\n\nMy personal story: My dad is adopted, as a child I was always curious about \u201cmy\u201d other family (aka his bio family). My dad always held to saying, \u201cthe family that wanted me was my real family\u201d even though they kinda sucked (drugs, alcoholism, abuse).\n\nI watched my mom gently ask my dad over the years if his interest changed and it never did. He sounds a bit like your ex-saying he doesn\u2019t have enough interest to pursue it. Now that I\u2019m older and know more about adoptees and generational trauma and know my dad better, I think it\u2019s too much for him. If he TRULY wanted to know more, he would.\n\n When I was 31 I took a DNA test to learn my heritage. While I can see extended paternal family on my ancestry pageI don\u2019t contact them or click their names. I don\u2019t Google them. I didn\u2019t share the results of the DNA test with my father or ever tell him I took the test. I wanted to know some health details before pursuing parenthood but that\u2019s it. I have no regrets-ultimately I respected his wishes and took it upon myself to learn more as an adult. \n\nHis sibling (also adopted but from another family) went after her bio family for her kids. It was a mess. \n\niMo, it\u2019s best to honor the wishes of the person who went through the experience of being an adoptee. If your daughter wants to pursue her own journey after 18, that\u2019s for her to navigate. \n\nJust my thoughts though, my answer changes to NTA if you can respectfully and non-argumentatively revisit this dialogue with your ex and get his consent. Otherwise, let your family love her endlessly and let that be enough. Get more chosen family if she needs more love.", "YTA - what exactly makes these people grandparents to your child? They have no relationship with any of her parents and have no interest in having one. Mind your own business and cut it out.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your life\u2026 not to mention, it is your ex. Stay out if his life.\n\nYou are doing this for selfish reasons - because YOU want your daughter to grow up to have a big family. This is all about your wants and expectations. If it really were about the medical history, you would have led with that\u2026 but you didn\u2019t.\n\nButt out. If your daughter wants to find her other side of the family, that\u2019s a conversation she can have with her father when she is older.", "YTA. Your ex explicitly told you he doesn\u2019t want to find his bio parents what makes you think you have the right to do it. Why can\u2019t you be happy with the family you have?

No one gets to foist it on them.", "\"If for no reason other than knowing their medical history\" is that really the reason? You can ask about medical history (they are not obligated to give you this) without having your child meet up with them.

Not saying either of those 2 different reasons are bad, but they are very different. And did you discuss this openly and honestly with your ex-husband?

My adoptive parents were provided some medical history, some personal information (names etc redacted or removed), and a small note written by her.\n\nWe made contact when I was in my late 20s early 30s. We had a decent relationship, I met her parents, they were shitlords of the highest order. Very hypocritical. Birth mom was basically forced to give me up b/c it looked bad on her Air Force Baptist Preacher father and the rest of the family. But when I made contact they were all lovey dovey. I never talked to her parents again.\n\nThen birth mom started making demands on my time and emotional energy I was unwilling to meet.THEN she tried to make an end around me to contact my daughter. That was the last fucking straw.\n\nIt is not your job to entertain thoughts of reunion, reconciliation, or anything like that. It is 100% up to your ex whether or not the child you share together gets to meet his birth family. This decision is never yours to make.\n\nYou're allowed to provide input, even make suggestions or requests, but this decision is ultimately his to make alone. This is his birth family, his trauma, and yes he has trauma stemming from this. All us adopted people do even if we don't consciously recognize it.\n\nThere is a deep seated trauma related to being given up for adoption. The trauma of your tiny infant body knowing you're not with your mother who birthed you. When you learn of being adopted, even in the most kind and loving ways, there is the immediate reaction of \"why\", followed by \"wasn't I good enough?\"\n\nYou are projecting onto him and your child what you wish you had, what you think should be done, how you want things to be handled.\n\nHe absolutely has the right to his medical information and history. You do not have that right except to advocate for your child to have their medical information and history. That is the right of your child.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have zero rights, privileges, or desires in this situation on a personal level. Only parental level for your child.\n\nIf your ex does not want to meet his birth parents that's just the end of the story for him, you, and your child together. I would urge you to have a conversation with him, and perhaps a therapist who specializes in adoption and adopted people to get a good handle on what could come of you pursuing this course of action.\n\nI would also urge you, should you decide to skip that, to drop the topic all together. I'm sure you mean well but as we all know the road to hell is paved with good intentions and this is one that can, and often does, backfire spectacularly.\n\nYou mention generational trauma here and frankly I don't see any from his side of the family, just what you're bringing to the table and I'm convinced that is the reason you're pursuing this. YOU need healing from your situation. YOU need understanding and compassion that you didn't get growing up. YOU are the one who's craving that personal connection to others you're related to. He isn't and your child for sure isn't, given what you've said about them here.\n\nLook, you seem like you're invested in the best for the child you and your ex have created together, and the three of you, and your family you do speak to, can absolutely raise a lovely, wonderful, kind, and happy child. You don't *need* to find his birth family. You want to.\n\nMy oldest child grew up around many cousins, aunts, uncles, and other relatives. They no longer speak to any of them because life experiences have taken them in separate directions (also religion is a relationship killer but that's another topic).\n\nMy youngest child is only 6 and spent the first 5 and a half years of her life with me, her mother, and our two housemates because none of us have large families with children, then when she started preschool 2019-2020 happened.\n\nShe's now in kindergarten and having the time of her life. Then she comes home and decompresses. She's a happy child and has no idea that there are kiddos out there with umpteen million relations having gala christmas parties etc. It doesn't register to her and likely never will until she's an adult with her own family and own personal connections.\n\nI wish you all the best in life and your family but *hard* YTA here.

Have an actual adult conversation with him and ask him what he really thinks.\n\nYta\n\nWould you be an asshole for going behind his back and finding his bio parents without letting him know? Yes.  Would you be an asshole having an adult conversation with him, confirming he wouldn't mind you finding them, and then you going to find them? No. \n\nSounds like you're afraid he'll say he doesn't want to track them down.", ">He has no interest in finding them\n\nThere's your answer.

Definitely YTA if you do this behind his back. Just talk to the guy", "According to your post history, you have only been sober for about a month.

My dad gave me an option to meet his biological family when he decided he wanted to connect with them (I was an adult and fully capable of understanding the impact of meeting them on MY mental health), I opted out because they are not my family.

For all you know if you find these people the first thing they will say about your daughter is they she shouldn\u2019t exist or worse.

My dad went NC with his family, and I'm grateful. They are incredibly toxic and even as an adult the extremely limited interaction I've had with them (pretty much only when someone dies) has been awful and always disappointing. Knowing them at all led to a lot of issues I needed to overcome as an adult. If you want your daughter to know more about her health, let her get some genetic testing to see if she's prone to any major issues that she should keep an eye on instead.
