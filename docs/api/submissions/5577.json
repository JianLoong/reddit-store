They don't ask about her, they don't acknowledge her birthday, or Christmas and it's very clear they want nothing to do with her. Their loss entirely. \n\nIssue is, I come from a big family. My mom is one of 12. So growing up, I always had cousins around. I do have 2 nieces (9f, 13f) and an extremely handicapped nephew (15m), but they're so far apart in age, I don't feel like my daughter will have the same experience growing up.\n\nMy dad is an only child, and I do not know any of my extended family on my Dad's side. My own grandfather has never acknowledged my sister and I... Let alone any of our kids. So my kiddo has me, my sister, my parents, her 3 cousins and my paternal grandmother (my mom only speaks to two of her living siblings and I'm no longer close to any of my cousins).\n\nMy ex is pretty adamant that he has no interest in finding his biological parents, and of course I would respect his wishes if he doesn't want anything to do with them, but I would like to meet them and allow my daughter to meet any aunties and uncles and cousins she might have from her dad's side of the family. If for no reason other than knowing their medical histories.\n\nWIBTA if I got one of those ancestors tests and tried to track down my ex's bio family?\n\nETA: There are so many people here making half-assed assumptions. \n\nFor more context: his bio dad contested the adoption, but his adoptive parents threw their money around until he couldn't afford to fight anymore. That came straight out of his mother's mouth.\n\nHe doesn't see adoption as a trauma, just a fact of life for him. He's not close at all with his adoptive family, so I don't even think he understands the dynamics of actually being a part of one. \n\nWe've talked about this before and while he personally has no interest in seeking them out, he has never once said he didn't want me to. He said it was more or less my choice if I wanted to try to find them. So I'm not even asking in the context of betraying my ex or hurting him. He. Doesn't. Care.\n\nI'm just aware that it could potentially affect the lives of many people and I'm not trying to blow anyone's life up--i just want my child to know where she comes from genetically, because i've  lived in her shoes. I know what it's like  to have only half of a family full of  dysfunction and generational trauma. I don't want that for her.\n\nETA 2: to all those asking why my mother is only in contact with 2 of her siblings, it's because she only has three brothers and 2 sisters who are still alive. Most of my cousins moved, are in jail, became right-wing fundamentalists, or are on meth or heroin. I'm not looking for a replacement family or trying to recreate my childhood with my daughter regardless of the delusional BS some of you are projecting onto me. \n\nI've had two and a half years to get one of these tests done, and it was a conversation we started having before I was even pregnant. If I wanted to go behind his back and \"betray his trust,\" I've had plenty of opportunities. Thanks for dogpiling on me, misrepresenting what I said, projecting your negative experiences onto my situation, and calling me names like crazy and cold.\n\nI'm no longer able to respond to comments but thanks to the people who actually read my entire post and offered constructive feedback.

It feels cruel and selfish.\n\nIf it\u2019s so important try asking him if he\u2019d be ok with that, if yes go on, if no then stop right there", "YTA. Absolutely not. As an adopted child, if my partner or ex partner ever contacted my biological family without consent, I\u2019d be LIVID. Like scorched earth livid. Your ex already said he has no interest in them.

That\u2019s on you. \n\nThis is incredibly misguided and irresponsibly optimistic.", "Wow!  This could really blow up in your face.  If you do this without his knowledge you could be causing yourself quite a bit of heartache.

You aren't doing this for medical reasons, that I could understand.  You are doing this because of something you want.  Your child can be perfectly happy with a small family, as well as building friendships that become your family.  This would be a complete violation to your ex and would permanently damage your relationship and cause him unnecessary harm.  If he ever wants to find his bio parents, that should be HIS choice.", "You need to back off of this, and discuss this with your ex, before doing anything.

You\u2019re doing this for selfish reasons (so your daughter has more related playmates?!?!) and the \u201cit\u2019s good to know family medical history\u201d, while perhaps useful, is the red herring that you\u2019re dangling out there to justify this massive breach of privacy that you\u2019re planning. \nYWBTAH. \nTalk to your ex about your wishes.

Go against his wishes and YTA.", "You would be a massive AH for going behind his back and finding his biological family. I'm adopted, I had no interest in finding my biological family, and my husband and I argued about it a lot. I would be furious if someone went behind my back and found them. (It's a moot point now, because bio family found me instead, the jackasses.)  Do not do this. It is NOT your place. YTA", "YTA you are doing it for selfish reasons. You want your child to grow up in some idyllic world with lots of family. And yet, if family was so important why aren\u2019t you still close with all those cousins you grew up with? Rather than dreaming of her living your childhood, why don\u2019t you work to make her childhood good for her without overstepping your bounds? Family isn\u2019t just blood. Build a family right there in your community.", "YTA 100%. Do not do this, it almost certainly will not end well or the way you hope.", "YTA - this is not appropriate because they are going to want to know about their son. That is IF they even want to be found. And it doesn\u2019t sound like he wants anything to do with them. Then invariably you\u2019re going to start talking about him in conversation, telling them things that he may not want you to share. It\u2019s his private life and you have NO business sharing ANY information about him. There\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019re good people. You could open yourself and your ex up to more trouble than its worth. And without giving them any info about their son, I see no reason why they\u2019d want to continue a relationship. I wouldn\u2019t. In fact I\u2019d find it odd and kinda creepy and I\u2019d assume that you\u2019re looking for money. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s just weird and disrespectful to go behind his back and open that communication when he doesn\u2019t want it. I would be pissed if I was him.       \nHow do you think this is going to go? Your child isn\u2019t even their kid. Yes they might be interested in their own son, but without that connection I doubt they would be as welcoming. At least not to the extent you are seeking. \n\nFurthermore, you said you have cousins you\u2019ve lost touch with. Well why don\u2019t *you* rekindle those relationships?! Even if your mom doesn\u2019t speak to any of her siblings you can still rekindle a relationship with your cousins. At least it\u2019s your own family! You\u2019re using this excuse that you grew up in a big family as a reason to insert yourself into these stranger\u2019s lives when you have 11 other uncles and aunts around with kids that you don\u2019t talk to. And if you can\u2019t talk to these people then why is that? You have your dad\u2019s side who doesn\u2019t talk to your family, and your mom only talks to 2 of her siblings out 10\u2026\u2026\u2026.         \nSorry, but this seems like your family is the common denominator here and that makes me suspicious that your family is the problem. I feel like there is a lot of drama buried in your family dynamics. And now you want to start some drama by going behind your ex\u2019s back and find his bio parents because you think they can provide a bigger family for your 2.5 yr old daughter?? Just don\u2019t. Your child doesn\u2019t need them and neither do you. Unless your ex wants to reach out, it\u2019s none of your business.", "YTA and you need therapy . Only an selfish person would do something like this. Get help for yourself so you can come to terms on how to raise your child as a single parent. You are not doing anything positive for your child with this selfish thinking.", "YTA. This is a major boundary violation for your ex. \n\nIt is great you want your daughter to have a good childhood, but this is barking up the wrong tree. You can\u2019t create cousins she doesn\u2019t have, or make familial bonds appear over shared DNA even if (Biig Iif) these people want to connect.\n\nInstead you can create a found family and friends network. Join parenting groups. Host events for kids your daughter\u2019s age. Enroll her in activities she enjoys and encourage her to meet people her own age.\n\nEven if she did have the cousins you had, your own situation shows that family can scatter as life comes and goes. But teaching her and encouraging her to find likeminded people and make her own community will mean she won\u2019t be alone, and neither will you.", "Yes. YWBTA. It is HIS family. HIS choice. Do not ever go behind someone's back. You can't keep this a secret from him anyway and it's wrong. Don't even figure out their names. It's not your business.", "YTA\n\nThe *only reason* you should be contacting those bio parents is for medical records, if those are not available.", "YTA. He\u2019s not interested and you want your child to have the large, happy family experience you did. He set a boundary when he told you that. \n\nWhat you want to do is driven by fantasies and selfishness. \n\nWhy potentially open up old wounds for his biological father? Or your ex? The potential to cause a lot of pain to people outweighs your need for the big happy family.", "I\u2019d say yes. YWBTA. \n\n\nMy personal story: My dad is adopted, as a child I was always curious about \u201cmy\u201d other family (aka his bio family). My dad always held to saying, \u201cthe family that wanted me was my real family\u201d even though they kinda sucked (drugs, alcoholism, abuse).\n\nI watched my mom gently ask my dad over the years if his interest changed and it never did. He sounds a bit like your ex-saying he doesn\u2019t have enough interest to pursue it. Now that I\u2019m older and know more about adoptees and generational trauma and know my dad better, I think it\u2019s too much for him. If he TRULY wanted to know more, he would.\n\n When I was 31 I took a DNA test to learn my heritage. While I can see extended paternal family on my ancestry pageI don\u2019t contact them or click their names. I don\u2019t Google them. I didn\u2019t share the results of the DNA test with my father or ever tell him I took the test. I wanted to know some health details before pursuing parenthood but that\u2019s it. I have no regrets-ultimately I respected his wishes and took it upon myself to learn more as an adult. \n\nHis sibling (also adopted but from another family) went after her bio family for her kids. It was a mess. \n\niMo, it\u2019s best to honor the wishes of the person who went through the experience of being an adoptee. If your daughter wants to pursue her own journey after 18, that\u2019s for her to navigate. \n\nJust my thoughts though, my answer changes to NTA if you can respectfully and non-argumentatively revisit this dialogue with your ex and get his consent. Otherwise, let your family love her endlessly and let that be enough. Get more chosen family if she needs more love.", "YTA - what exactly makes these people grandparents to your child? They have no relationship with any of her parents and have no interest in having one. Mind your own business and cut it out.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your life\u2026 not to mention, it is your ex. Stay out if his life.\n\nYou are doing this for selfish reasons - because YOU want your daughter to grow up to have a big family. This is all about your wants and expectations. If it really were about the medical history, you would have led with that\u2026 but you didn\u2019t.\n\nButt out. If your daughter wants to find her other side of the family, that\u2019s a conversation she can have with her father when she is older.", "YTA.

NTA", "YTA\n\nand here's why:\n\nHi, I could be your ex given my lived situation. I'm not, but hear me out.\n\nI was adopted at birth, birth mother gave me up semi-willingly. My adoptive parents were provided some medical history, some personal information (names etc redacted or removed), and a small note written by her.\n\nWe made contact when I was in my late 20s early 30s. We had a decent relationship, I met her parents, they were shitlords of the highest order. Very hypocritical. Birth mom was basically forced to give me up b/c it looked bad on her Air Force Baptist Preacher father and the rest of the family. But when I made contact they were all lovey dovey. I never talked to her parents again.\n\nThen birth mom started making demands on my time and emotional energy I was unwilling to meet.THEN she tried to make an end around me to contact my daughter. That was the last fucking straw.\n\nIt is not your job to entertain thoughts of reunion, reconciliation, or anything like that. It is 100% up to your ex whether or not the child you share together gets to meet his birth family. This decision is never yours to make.\n\nYou're allowed to provide input, even make suggestions or requests, but this decision is ultimately his to make alone. This is his birth family, his trauma, and yes he has trauma stemming from this. All us adopted people do even if we don't consciously recognize it.\n\nThere is a deep seated trauma related to being given up for adoption. The trauma of your tiny infant body knowing you're not with your mother who birthed you. When you learn of being adopted, even in the most kind and loving ways, there is the immediate reaction of \"why\", followed by \"wasn't I good enough?\"\n\nYou are projecting onto him and your child what you wish you had, what you think should be done, how you want things to be handled.\n\nHe absolutely has the right to his medical information and history. You do not have that right except to advocate for your child to have their medical information and history. That is the right of your child.\n\nYou, on the other hand, have zero rights, privileges, or desires in this situation on a personal level. Only parental level for your child.\n\nIf your ex does not want to meet his birth parents that's just the end of the story for him, you, and your child together. I would urge you to have a conversation with him, and perhaps a therapist who specializes in adoption and adopted people to get a good handle on what could come of you pursuing this course of action.\n\nI would also urge you, should you decide to skip that, to drop the topic all together. I'm sure you mean well but as we all know the road to hell is paved with good intentions and this is one that can, and often does, backfire spectacularly.\n\nYou mention generational trauma here and frankly I don't see any from his side of the family, just what you're bringing to the table and I'm convinced that is the reason you're pursuing this. YOU need healing from your situation. YOU need understanding and compassion that you didn't get growing up. YOU are the one who's craving that personal connection to others you're related to. He isn't and your child for sure isn't, given what you've said about them here.\n\nLook, you seem like you're invested in the best for the child you and your ex have created together, and the three of you, and your family you do speak to, can absolutely raise a lovely, wonderful, kind, and happy child. You don't *need* to find his birth family. You want to.\n\nMy oldest child grew up around many cousins, aunts, uncles, and other relatives. They no longer speak to any of them because life experiences have taken them in separate directions (also religion is a relationship killer but that's another topic).\n\nMy youngest child is only 6 and spent the first 5 and a half years of her life with me, her mother, and our two housemates because none of us have large families with children, then when she started preschool 2019-2020 happened.\n\nShe's now in kindergarten and having the time of her life. Then she comes home and decompresses. She's a happy child and has no idea that there are kiddos out there with umpteen million relations having gala christmas parties etc. It doesn't register to her and likely never will until she's an adult with her own family and own personal connections.\n\nI wish you all the best in life and your family but *hard* YTA here.

Let alone any of our kids.\n\nSooo... you don't actually come from a big family. You know your family on one side and not on the other. Cool, that's like your kid! \n\n>(my mom only speaks to two of her living siblings and I'm no longer close to any of my cousins)\n\nOH! So even on the side of the family you knew, you aren't close to people. Wow, weird to think it is important to have someone in your childhood who you don't care about as an adult. It's almost like people can live their lives regardless of how many cousins they have or if they hang out with them.\n\n>My ex is pretty adamant that he has no interest in finding his biological parents\n\nGreat! That seems settled. In that case... we must be done here now, right? No?? Huh.\n\n>I would like to meet them and allow my daughter to meet any aunties and uncles and cousins she might have from her dad's side of the family. If for no reason other than knowing their medical histories.\n\nIt doesn't take meeting a whole tree of strangers to get a medical history. In fact, a 2.5 year old can't personally take a medical history anyways so doesn't sound like she needs to meet them at all if that was really the reason you wanted this (which it obviously is not). Also, you clearly state your Ex wants nothing to do with them (and yeah, I read your edit, it doesn't make anything better) and it is REAL WEIRD to think that this whole set of strangers would meet his kid but then not also reach out to him, the person you will be providing them an easy roadmap to find.\n\nThis is all a terrible idea. This is your Ex's family, not yours. If he wanted to reach out to them, that would be his business. Deciding that you need to do this to fill your daughter's childhood with cousins like the ones you never see now or the medical history that your Ex has lived his whole life without is just ridiculous. Leave this alone. Go make some friends and fill your kid's life with aunties and uncles and cousins that you chose because you get along with them, not because they techincally share some small amount of dna with her.\n\nDo not do this.\n\nBonus round!\n\n>and an extremely handicapped nephew (15m),\n\nThis is the one and only time you mention your nephew, his disability plays exactly NO ROLE in all of this, and yet! You reeeaaally felt you needed to mention it. Which... well, I have nothing nice to say about this, so feel free to fill in own blank here with what I think this says about you as an aunt.

It was just me, my siblings, my parents, my grandparents, and my mom's brother (my uncle) and his wife (my aunt).\n\nI wasn't traumatized, and I wasn't \"deprived\" of a bigger family.\n\nHonestly, when I would listen to my friends struggle to name all their countless uncles and cousins and aunts, I just felt bad for them and felt glad that I had such a close, tight-knit family that was easy to keep track of. I could practically count them on my fingers (which is a major convenience to a little kid)!\n\nAlso, family doesn't mean blood. I have other \"uncles\" and \"aunts\" who are simply my parents' closest friends, and feel like family to me so I call them that.\n\nFocus on surrounding your daughter with the family and friends you have, and she will never go a day feeling left out or unloved.", "YTA\n\nAnd now, we know why you are an ex...", "This is YTA because you\u2019re doing it because what YOU want and YOUR dreams for your child\u2019s life.

Doesn't matter if bio dad contested the adoption, he let his son go and now lives his own life, plus you don't know Mom's situation. If you go waltzing into their lives you could seriously fuck up their families. They could have other kids. They could want nothing to do with their kids. They could be on the other side of the world. You don't know. You don't need to know. Biological family isn't everything and that's the lesson you need to teach your children; they can make their own lives happy and fun with their own choices, including who to love as family.\n\nPlus your ex has already said he doesn't want to find them so respect him even if you don't respect strangers\n\nDo not do this", "YTA - you have absolutely no right to do this.

And I\u2019m gonna say this right now, if you think ruining your relationship with your spouse is worth your daughter having some big family memories.. it\u2019s not.\n\nAlso willing to sacrifice your marriage for something you assume your child will want at 2.5 years of age is just no.. I grew up in a big family, lots of cousins, aunts and uncles and I talk to.. none of them as an adult. Because they\u2019re all exhausting and I\u2019m introverted as hell. As a child I was FORCED to spend time with this huge family that didn\u2019t respect my boundaries and had zero respect for personal space. I dislike most of them as an adult. Just because YOU had a good time with a big family doesn\u2019t mean your daughter will nor will she have the same experience you did. How about instead you do YOUR best as a mother to harbor meaningful relationships for your daughter of all shapes and sizes? Not just blood related excuses for relationships.\n\nYou don\u2019t even know who these bio people are, what if they\u2019re not good people and you open pandoras box to some horrible people to bring your daughter around?

What makes you think this bio family will be any better?  Join a parents of toddlers group and nurture connections with families of kids her age who live near you.", "YTA. What a bizarre request? Your expectations of the two people who decided to put their kid up for adoption are wild! They may want to forget all about the baby they wanted to leave with another family. Why on earth do you believe that people who didn't want your ex will suddenly provide a huge loving family and support structure for your child? This is real life. Surely even Hallmark movies don't pretend that what you expect is a 'thing'?", "Huge huge YTA. Please don't do this. Such a disaster. This is completely not your place. I can't even believe you would consider such a thing.", "YWBTA\n\nYou will most definitely be disrupting someone\u2019s life and it could even affect his parents marriages if they\u2019re not together. You could also be met with disappointment and neither will want to meet with you and your family or they will be met with disappointment since your ex doesn\u2019t want to meet them. If anything you should only do this if your ex actually wants to. Although the only upside to this will be getting family medical history but that\u2019s only if his parents are nice enough to even give you that information. Also would your ex even take the test???? Too many questions with no answers with plenty of major risks. You also need to think about how this would affect your daughter aswell especially if things go south.\n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t do this since there\u2019s too many risks and you also have a kid to think about.", "Mmm\u2026. It could go either way. YTA or NTA:\nHere\u2019s why: because your ex\u2019s bio dad contested the adoption until he could no longer afford it, and your ex said he didn\u2019t care if you tried seeking his bio family out.\nThis is what I would do:\nGo ahead and do the DNA test for your daughter. There are a few reasons.\n1. Medical history.\n- it\u2019s always been extremely important to know one\u2019s family medical history, but it hasn\u2019t always been so easy. Especially for those who come from adoptive families.\n- well this would be important information for your daughter and potentially her dad down the line if one day one &/or both of them were diagnosed with something serious. Needing to know if it\u2019s hereditary/in their family history could potentially change the way they are treated for it medically.\n(I have rheumatoid arthritis that my fraternal grandfather also had. Didn\u2019t change things, but it helped me understand some things.) \n\n2. Finding family. \n- because your ex\u2019s bio dad contested the adoption I think that if you find him through the DNA test reaching out to him would, I\u2019m my opinion be okay, and probably welcomed. He would probably be excited to hear from you.\n- if you happen to find family from the fraternal side of the family reaching out to them might be okay.\n- if you find his mom reaching out to her through email is the most you should do until she responds. If you only find family from the maternal side you need to let them make the first move. Remember that all of you are getting the same information.\n- and above all, be prepared for backlash/pushback. Be prepared for people, even the ex\u2019s bio dad to not want to have anything to do with you &/or your daughter. It\u2019s been 38 years since your ex had any contact with anyone from his bio family. Neither of you truly knows what actually happened during the adoption process. All you have is what his adoptive parents have said, and by the sound of it they aren\u2019t the nicest people. I\u2019d have a hard time trusting anything they said. \n\n\n**there are some things to be aware of. \n1. You can\u2019t go into this thinking that it\u2019s going to end up like the movies or  Hallmark / Lifetime movie of the week.\n2. If you and your daughter don\u2019t come out of this experience with a new family please don\u2019t let that sour you. Just because you don\u2019t get a great response in the beginning doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. A lot of times people just need time to digest news like hearing there is family out in the world they didn\u2019t know about.\n\n- People can be very careful about who the let in into their \u201cinner circle\u201d. \n- You need to respect their decisions when it comes to what they choose to do when it comes to you and your daughter. Don\u2019t push their boundaries. Don\u2019t disrespect their feelings. \n\nOne more thing:\nThere are two big DNA testing kits that people use. They don\u2019t share information about clients between them. \nYou should test with both of these DNA companies because you never know who/what you will find out with either one.\nThey are\u2026\n1. 21 and Me\n2.

Please don't get into things that don't concern you.", "I'm going to say NTA but only if this is about your daughter finding her heritage. Because she is related to your ex's biological parents.\n\nI would speak to a therapist well versed in adoption matters.  For your daughter, at this point it matters less.  She knows who her mother is and who her father is and she has your side of the family to connect with.  But her fathers biological side is also important even if they may never have a part in her life.  She will likely get curious about them as she gets older.  It may not happen till she hits her teenage years as when she is younger she'll accept that her dad's adoptive parents are her biological grandparents because they won't be separated as not being biological.\n\nThis is very complicated and your need to respect your ex's wish of wanting no contact.  That may change in the future.  But you actually have his approval to go looking... he just doesn't want to know about it.\n\nI suspect that his father will be very interested in a grand daughter if his birth dad fought for him till he ran out of money.  His mother sounds like she was either very desperate for cash, or wanted to make his dad suffer (if he wanted to take the child and she didn't), or just didn't want to be a mother any more.\n\nI would not be hiding the fact that her dad was adopted from her and it doesn't sound like you will.  It's very possible that his birth dad is very open with his family (he may have a partner and kids) with the fact that they have a brother out there... or he may not because he's traumatised.  So even if you find him, there no no guarantees about anything but he may be keen to meet his kid's kid.\n\nThis is a loaded question and a hard one to answer because there are so many unknowns.  What I would not do is go looking for your ex's sake and expect him to accept that you have found his parents and expect him to meet them.  He doesn't have to, especially if he doesn't want to.  And they may not want to meet him.  This is what he's said but you may find that curiosity may get the better of him.  And if they are nice people he may want some questioned answered.\n\nI would want to know from curiosities sake and I would want to know why what happened, happened.  What actually led to his adoption etc.  But he is not me and you need to respect his wishes in this respect.", "Yta. Seriously just stop it.

Your own very large family was, according to you, awful, your father's indifferent and your ex's adopted family cold. But somehow you think there is an excellent chance that his biological family will be a) large with grandparents, uncles, aunties and cousins, b) actually decent people and c) interested in having a close relationship with your daughter.

According to OP, she praises the virtues of a large extended family:\n\n> I come from a big family. My mom is one of 12. So growing up, I always had cousins around.\n\nOP wants a similar dynamic for her daughter:\n\n> My child should have the option of having a relationship with these people should they choose to be part of her life.\n\nSuch a large family network is supposed to help her daughter overcome generational trauma:\n\n> This is about PREVENTiNG her from inheriting my emotional baggage.\n\nOP wants a large family network but said family has been a source of grief:\n\n> As for my cousins, almost all of them are in jail, on hardcore drugs, moved away, are shitty people in general\n\nHow does she deal with this familial \u201cemotional baggage\u201d? Until recently (within the last two months), OP was addicted to drugs\u2014specifically opiates\u2014sharing drug stories and advice with other addicts:\n\n> [November 17, 2022] Looking to hear stories where you were underdosed or overdosed, you didn't get what you ordered, or just had a bad experience with rcbenzos or synthetic opiates in general. What happened to you? Were there any lasting side effects? (Such as losing days/weeks of time, permanent brain damage, short term or long term permanent memory loss)\n\n> I had a very bad experience recently and so this question is important.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/RCbenzos1/comments/yxhy8t/horror_stories/\n\n> [December 24, 2022] I've personally chewed on or left fentanyl patches under my tongue or in my cheek. That was ages ago though, before the big crackdown on opiate prescriptions and before it was a prevalent street drug, so I'm not sure how or if they've changed over the years, but what the OP was saying is NOT \"misinformation.\" It CAN be absorbed transdermally.\n\n> I already said they're hard to get nowadays. I live in a very small town, so addicts will often take whatever they can get no matter how much it costs. If patches are their only option, they'll drop an insane amount of $$$ even if it means they can't afford food.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/IdahoMurdersUncensord/comments/zosfo5/i_have_a_feeling_the_roommates_not_hearing/j1j98i4/?context=3\n\nUsually, I would not comment on another person\u2019s drug usage. If you are a single adult, I do not care what you do in private with your free time. You have free will, so enjoy it. Want to get high on benzos for a long weekend, then be my guest. Want to wear green body paint and stalk Big Foot on a summer night, then good luck to you. Want to stage an reenactment of Star Wars with sock puppets, then please have fun.\n\nBut the moment you become responsible for another life\u2014whether it be a pet, a baby, or a parent with dementia\u2014your free will is curtailed. You are under a moral, ethical, and legal duty to care for that life. Being a drug addict violates that duty of care because of selfishness.\n\nThis is why I find this whole post to be ridiculous. OP repeatedly states that finding her daughter\u2019s paternal relatives will give her a better life. The first step to a better life for her daughter would be for /u/Runaway-rain to focus on herself by stopping all drug use and becoming a sober parent.\n\n*[Edit: fixed a broken link]*", "Exactly. I completely agree with both of the above points!", "You clearly didn\u2019t read OP\u2019s entire edit. She said that her ex doesn\u2019t care either way(not in those exact words) if she goes ahead with this DNA testing.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from but what exactly are you trying to achieve by exposing OP like this? It\u2019s not like CPS randomly browse reddit and can identify an anonymous account? Both behaviours shown here are worrisome.", "There\u2019s a massive difference between someone being fine if their kids know their genetic make up and being fine with someone inviting people they don\u2019t want in their life into it.", "Please stop arguing. If you're this sure that you're justified in your actions don't seek judgment here, log off and enjoy life", "Omg thank you and I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t the only one who saw that. Horrible!\n\nAll of what you said was perfectly put. Hit the nail on the head", "Genuine question but actually what are grandparents rights? Surely that\u2019s not a thing..", "Honestly if I were you I\u2019d be more worried about any potential baggage my daughter would have from having an absent father and benzo addicted mother.\n\nStop worrying about extended family and maybe work on your own shit first.", "OP wants to do this, so OP is backfilling reasons for why it should be done and ignoring any other advice to the contrary.\n\nI hope, honestly, that things work out for you OP. But if you're doing this, just do it. Don't keep coming up with reasons to justify your actions. You should come clean to your husband, announce your intentions, and if he is really as fine with it as you seem to say then nothing is lost.\n\nIf he is hugely opposed to it, which you seem to know he will be or you wouldn't be hiding things, then at least you have the chance to stop before you cause a rift in your family.\n\nOr, just do whatever you want to do. If you're going to come on and ask for judgment, though, respect the judgmenet. If you're right and are incapable of making any mistakes or being misguided, why are you asking random people on the internet for advice on Christmas Eve?"]}
