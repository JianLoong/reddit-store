It feels cruel and selfish.\n\nIf it\u2019s so important try asking him if he\u2019d be ok with that, if yes go on, if no then stop right there", "YTA. Absolutely not. As an adopted child, if my partner or ex partner ever contacted my biological family without consent, I\u2019d be LIVID. Like scorched earth livid. Your ex already said he has no interest in them.

That\u2019s on you. \n\nThis is incredibly misguided and irresponsibly optimistic.", "Wow!  This could really blow up in your face.

You aren't doing this for medical reasons, that I could understand.  You are doing this because of something you want.  Your child can be perfectly happy with a small family, as well as building friendships that become your family.  This would be a complete violation to your ex and would permanently damage your relationship and cause him unnecessary harm.  If he ever wants to find his bio parents, that should be HIS choice.", "You need to back off of this, and discuss this with your ex, before doing anything.

I'm adopted, I had no interest in finding my biological family, and my husband and I argued about it a lot. I would be furious if someone went behind my back and found them. (It's a moot point now, because bio family found me instead, the jackasses.)  Do not do this. It is NOT your place. YTA", "YTA you are doing it for selfish reasons. You want your child to grow up in some idyllic world with lots of family. And yet, if family was so important why aren\u2019t you still close with all those cousins you grew up with? Rather than dreaming of her living your childhood, why don\u2019t you work to make her childhood good for her without overstepping your bounds? Family isn\u2019t just blood. Build a family right there in your community.", "YTA 100%. Do not do this, it almost certainly will not end well or the way you hope.", "YTA - this is not appropriate because they are going to want to know about their son. That is IF they even want to be found. And it doesn\u2019t sound like he wants anything to do with them. Then invariably you\u2019re going to start talking about him in conversation, telling them things that he may not want you to share. It\u2019s his private life and you have NO business sharing ANY information about him. There\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019re good people. You could open yourself and your ex up to more trouble than its worth. And without giving them any info about their son, I see no reason why they\u2019d want to continue a relationship. I wouldn\u2019t. In fact I\u2019d find it odd and kinda creepy and I\u2019d assume that you\u2019re looking for money. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s just weird and disrespectful to go behind his back and open that communication when he doesn\u2019t want it. I would be pissed if I was him.       \nHow do you think this is going to go? Your child isn\u2019t even their kid. Yes they might be interested in their own son, but without that connection I doubt they would be as welcoming. At least not to the extent you are seeking. \n\nFurthermore, you said you have cousins you\u2019ve lost touch with. Well why don\u2019t *you* rekindle those relationships?! Even if your mom doesn\u2019t speak to any of her siblings you can still rekindle a relationship with your cousins. At least it\u2019s your own family! You\u2019re using this excuse that you grew up in a big family as a reason to insert yourself into these stranger\u2019s lives when you have 11 other uncles and aunts around with kids that you don\u2019t talk to. And if you can\u2019t talk to these people then why is that? You have your dad\u2019s side who doesn\u2019t talk to your family, and your mom only talks to 2 of her siblings out 10\u2026\u2026\u2026.         \nSorry, but this seems like your family is the common denominator here and that makes me suspicious that your family is the problem. I feel like there is a lot of drama buried in your family dynamics. And now you want to start some drama by going behind your ex\u2019s back and find his bio parents because you think they can provide a bigger family for your 2.5 yr old daughter?? Just don\u2019t. Your child doesn\u2019t need them and neither do you. Unless your ex wants to reach out, it\u2019s none of your business.", "YTA and you need therapy . Only an selfish person would do something like this. Get help for yourself so you can come to terms on how to raise your child as a single parent. You are not doing anything positive for your child with this selfish thinking.", "YTA. This is a major boundary violation for your ex. \n\nIt is great you want your daughter to have a good childhood, but this is barking up the wrong tree. You can\u2019t create cousins she doesn\u2019t have, or make familial bonds appear over shared DNA even if (Biig Iif) these people want to connect.\n\nInstead you can create a found family and friends network. Join parenting groups. Host events for kids your daughter\u2019s age. Enroll her in activities she enjoys and encourage her to meet people her own age.\n\nEven if she did have the cousins you had, your own situation shows that family can scatter as life comes and goes. But teaching her and encouraging her to find likeminded people and make her own community will mean she won\u2019t be alone, and neither will you.", "Yes. YWBTA. It is HIS family. HIS choice. Do not ever go behind someone's back. You can't keep this a secret from him anyway and it's wrong. Don't even figure out their names.

He\u2019s not interested and you want your child to have the large, happy family experience you did. He set a boundary when he told you that. \n\nWhat you want to do is driven by fantasies and selfishness. \n\nWhy potentially open up old wounds for his biological father? Or your ex? The potential to cause a lot of pain to people outweighs your need for the big happy family.", "I\u2019d say yes. YWBTA. \n\n\nMy personal story: My dad is adopted, as a child I was always curious about \u201cmy\u201d other family (aka his bio family). My dad always held to saying, \u201cthe family that wanted me was my real family\u201d even though they kinda sucked (drugs, alcoholism, abuse).\n\nI watched my mom gently ask my dad over the years if his interest changed and it never did. He sounds a bit like your ex-saying he doesn\u2019t have enough interest to pursue it. Now that I\u2019m older and know more about adoptees and generational trauma and know my dad better, I think it\u2019s too much for him. If he TRULY wanted to know more, he would.\n\n When I was 31 I took a DNA test to learn my heritage. While I can see extended paternal family on my ancestry pageI don\u2019t contact them or click their names. I don\u2019t Google them. I didn\u2019t share the results of the DNA test with my father or ever tell him I took the test. I wanted to know some health details before pursuing parenthood but that\u2019s it. I have no regrets-ultimately I respected his wishes and took it upon myself to learn more as an adult. \n\nHis sibling (also adopted but from another family) went after her bio family for her kids. It was a mess. \n\niMo, it\u2019s best to honor the wishes of the person who went through the experience of being an adoptee. If your daughter wants to pursue her own journey after 18, that\u2019s for her to navigate. \n\nJust my thoughts though, my answer changes to NTA if you can respectfully and non-argumentatively revisit this dialogue with your ex and get his consent. Otherwise, let your family love her endlessly and let that be enough. Get more chosen family if she needs more love.", "YTA - what exactly makes these people grandparents to your child?

If it really were about the medical history, you would have led with that\u2026 but you didn\u2019t.\n\nButt out.

I am so worked up by this lol", "We've had several conversations about it before and it's not like he harbors any ill will toward his bio family. His disinterest is just apathy. He doesn't want to go out of his way to find them, but I very much doubt he wouldn't be receptive to them if they found him first somehow.", "This is what I wondered. Her fathers family doesn\u2019t talk to them and her mom doesn\u2019t talk to 8 of her 10 siblings. OPs family seems to be the common denominator here. When that many people don\u2019t talk to someone it raised a red flag for me. Id like to know if she can rekindle a relationship with her cousins, and if not, why not?

She once told me that his biological father contested the adoption, but he was young and poor, and they were able to throw their money around.

I had an incredible fear that if I was ever bad, that my parents (who are super awesome btw) would return me. After all, it was so easy for one family to get rid of me, why couldn\u2019t a second family do it? I constantly felt like I didn\u2019t fit in. Every time someone said I looked just like my parents, I was secretly uncomfortable because I\u2019m not blood related to them.
