At the beginning, I stayed pretty closed-off and kept to myself most of the time, but, eventually (and unavoidably), I started making friends with the people around me.\n\nThanks to this new wave of interactions, I met Jon (M25), a guy who worked at the jewelry store at the end of the hallway (My shop is the one at the beginning of it). Overall, all of our interactions were very friendly and it was easy to keep up the conversation with him. After about three weeks or so, I asked him if he was married (I noticed he wore a ring) and he told me that yes, he was married and not only that: His wife was the daughter of the store owner (his boss).\n\nSo, with that, I'll jump foward a month or so when his store changed places: From the end of the hallway to right in front of my shop. The thing is, this new proximity made our interactions more frecuent. He started to show interest (romantically) so I tried to show him as best as I could that I wasn't interested.\n\nA few days later, he invited me to go get lunch with him and I rejected him as kindly as I could, stating that I always bring my own food and I don't like changing plans last minute. He wasn't going to accept a \"no\" for an answer and refused to get out of the shop unless I told him why I was rejecting him. So, I asked him as a reply what were his actual intentions with me. To be honest, I was kinda sharp with my question, and I felt I made him quite uncomfortable, but he just told me \"he needed some time to reply\" and left.\n\nOnce it was my time to go home, I went to my usual bus station. The thing is that, when I arrived, he was there waiting for me. Not going to lie, this made me incredibly uncomfortable and I even considered going back inside to the hotel to call a cab, but my bus was coming in a minute and I chose to wait. To summarize, he approached me but I got into the bus before he could say anything.\n\nNext morining, he got inside my shop, ready to talk, but before he could open his mouth I told him: \"Whatever you were going to say, I don't want to hear it. You are married to a beautiful woman. I know her, she knows me. Your job depends on your relationship with her. And, on top of that, I'm not interested, you must know that by now. Let's keep things professional and don't adress me unless it's something extremely important\". He thank me for being direct and left me alone.\n\nToday, he came by again and asked me if I wanted to talk. I told him that we had nothing to talk about, and he just left giving me the dirty eye. The thing is, I feel like I was too drastic with my responses and that I made a big deal out of it, yet, I believe he is being incredibly disrespectful to his wife and that he doesn't deserve any soft treatment. I can't stand cheaters.  \nSo, Reddit, AITA for not even letting him confess to me?", "created_utc": 1694894636, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kgmcd/aita_for_blocking_all_possible_romantic_advances/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And fuck this guy for trying to cheat especially after being freshly married\n\nThank you for your comment.  \nI can't help but feel extremely sorry for his wife. They've been married for a year and a half and she seems to have given everything to him: His job, his car and even the house where he lives, everything he has it's thanks to her (His words, not mine). And I'm not saying there's anything wrong in supporting one's partner, but to cheat (Or attempt to) on her is such a low, coward move after all she has done for him. I don't know if I'm the only one he has been trying to hit on, and honestly, I don't want to know.", "Thank you for your comment, and also for your concern.   \nBecause of the word count I couldn't fit the whole story in, but he is indeed quite creepy. He tends to stalk the people that interact with him. Ex.: Found my instagram handle in a way that almost made me delete the whole account out of fear, congratulated a girl for getting offically hired when she hadn't told anyone, etc.   \nRegarding your question about whether he could get me into trouble or not, my answer is that I don't think so. This last conversation that we had was at the door of my shop and recently my boss installed a camera with audio recording, so, hopefully, it got everything.", "Thank you for your comment :)", "I will, thank you for the advice. My boss \\*might\\* be able to do something. I'll ask HR as well :)", "Hello! Thank you for your comment.   \nYes, I thought the same, that maybe he saw me as an easy target. Mind you, we have only known each other for roughly three months, in which the first two he was so far away we only talked at the end of the day when we were about to leave. Being too friendly sometimes backfires haha", "Thank you for your kind words!   \nI will eventually, as a woman, I absolutely should.", "I think you handled it perfectly.", "That may be why he's trying to cheat. Some guys are extremely insecure and feel emasculated if their wives are the main providers, and end up cheating just to feel like a Real Man again. It's pathetic and you're completely right to say exactly what you did.", "I think it is time to record his little seduction attempts on the sly and send a copy to his wife...and the owner of the shop.", "\" my boss installed a camera with audio recording\"\n\nGood to hear. I too feel bad for the wife.:-(", "Hi! I actually have her instagram handle and the phone number of her father (For business reasons, he gave it to me), but I don't want to act on it quite yet. Even though their store and mine are two different entities and we do not have a common employer, I don't want to risk getting involved in a huge family drama while I'm still working here. Once I leave, I surely will. She deserves better.", "NTA. You were perfect in your response, if anything, not firm enough. \n\nGiven that he\u2019s taken to following you, im kind of concerned for your safety OP. I\u2019m not trying to worry you or freak you out, but I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t warn you about protecting yourself from assault. \n\nThe kind of guys who don\u2019t take know for an answer and who feel entitled to women are the kind of guys who hurt women for their own selfish wants. Please consider all of this in your future interactions and if this job is truly worth it. \n\nAgain, I hope I\u2019m being paranoid, but please consider it.", "NTA. Definitely not too drastic. You did the right thing. Those gut creepy feelings should always be followed. I\u2019d stay as far away from this guy as possible.", "Yeah, you\u2019re totally an asshole. You didn\u2019t find his qualities deserving of you and that totally makes you an asshole. Fuck no, you\u2019re obviously not. Dude is married. My advice? Kick him square in the balls. Next time you see him too. Just run up to him and kick him in his testes. And then post the conclusion on Reddit.", "NTA. Not everything needs a verbal explanation. If you're uncomfortable, that's the end of that", "NTA. Your actions are entirely appropriate. There is no need to doubt yourself. I sincerely hope you keep this strength for the rest of your life.", "NTA - not only is it wrong to cheat you would also probably both lose your jobs.", "NTA. If he keeps harassing you, report him to HR.", "NTA\n\nYou're never obligated to endure unwanted romantic advances. Adding on top of that the fact that he is single, that this is happening at work, and that he made you feel uncomfortable enough to want to not be in his presence...no, you are not the asshole for not letting him finish his confession.", "NTA. His intentions are to get into your pants. You know that. Tell him to stay away.", "NTA this is straight-up harassment, and it sounds like the only reason it's not sexual harassment is that you've effectively shut him down hard and fast. \n\nIf he continues, make it clear you don't owe him your silence about his behaviour, and if he thinks his behaviour wouldn't look good to his wife or his boss, he should have a red-hot think about that fact.", "You better buy some pepper spray.", "NTA\n\nYou refused to enter an affair with a guy you have no interest in. You showed good ethics, a healthy amount of self-respect and common sense.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Jon, who betrayed his wife by trying to cheat, and got upset that you didn't jump at the chance to have him in your bed.", "You said it perfectly. Men don\u2019t take rejection well tho. Please be vigilant of your surroundings of being followed. do not give out where you live, your address or anything that will give away your location. My ex used to stalk me and had his friends try to get a hold of me when I went no contact. They are sneaky and will try anything. I just want a fellow woman to be safe!\n\nNta", "NTA. Why feel guilty for pushing off a philanderer?", "Honey, you are being harassed. He's clearly not taking no for an answer and he may escalate into assault. Inform your boss and his boss immediately because right now you aren't safe. NTA of course.", "NTA  \n\n\nBE DRASTIC. No seriously, be blunt and say no when you want to, anybody tries to pursue anything past that is problematic.  You don't need to spare a second of your life to hear anything he hast to say, he is just some dude trying to invade your space, you owe him nothing.   I hope he leaves you alone.", "The last try to talk could have been him making sure that OP doesn't reveal him to his wife.", "Agree. And even if he had no romantic intentions (doubtful but let's assume), he is still bothering you while at work. In fact, you are both working.", "showing up at the bus stop! that is some horror movie shit, i got scared just reading it. nta, stay safe op.", "You are right. I made pretty much the same comment above, and I hope OP sees this.", "You could also start recording when he comes over, if you see him heading to your store prep to record so that you can have proof just in case. Looking for a new job is probably for the best for you so you don't get caught up in some unwanted drama where you might be labeled as the bad guy.", "Please be careful. He sounds like he could be a predator. Take precautions when you leave work for the day or when he might be around. Don\u2019t let him corner you or get you alone. I don\u2019t know where you are, but you may want to invest in some pepper spray. Just in case.\n\nEdit to add: Bravo on the way you handled him! It was masterful!   \nand definitely NTA.", "Do you have security around? Can you ask them to help you a bit with him? I also second recording interactionsvas soon as he comes near you legal or not.\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s a shame that creeps like him take advantage of a nice person.", "id still get some sort of documentation in case he tries to say you were approaching him. Cheaters can often try to preemptively discredit others if there is a chance that person could get them in trouble"]}
