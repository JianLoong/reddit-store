At the beginning, I stayed pretty closed-off and kept to myself most of the time, but, eventually (and unavoidably), I started making friends with the people around me.\n\nThanks to this new wave of interactions, I met Jon (M25), a guy who worked at the jewelry store at the end of the hallway (My shop is the one at the beginning of it). Overall, all of our interactions were very friendly and it was easy to keep up the conversation with him. After about three weeks or so, I asked him if he was married (I noticed he wore a ring) and he told me that yes, he was married and not only that: His wife was the daughter of the store owner (his boss).\n\nSo, with that, I'll jump foward a month or so when his store changed places: From the end of the hallway to right in front of my shop. The thing is, this new proximity made our interactions more frecuent. He started to show interest (romantically) so I tried to show him as best as I could that I wasn't interested.\n\nA few days later, he invited me to go get lunch with him and I rejected him as kindly as I could, stating that I always bring my own food and I don't like changing plans last minute. He wasn't going to accept a \"no\" for an answer and refused to get out of the shop unless I told him why I was rejecting him. So, I asked him as a reply what were his actual intentions with me. To be honest, I was kinda sharp with my question, and I felt I made him quite uncomfortable, but he just told me \"he needed some time to reply\" and left.\n\nOnce it was my time to go home, I went to my usual bus station. The thing is that, when I arrived, he was there waiting for me. Not going to lie, this made me incredibly uncomfortable and I even considered going back inside to the hotel to call a cab, but my bus was coming in a minute and I chose to wait. To summarize, he approached me but I got into the bus before he could say anything.\n\nNext morining, he got inside my shop, ready to talk, but before he could open his mouth I told him: \"Whatever you were going to say, I don't want to hear it. You are married to a beautiful woman. I know her, she knows me. Your job depends on your relationship with her. And, on top of that, I'm not interested, you must know that by now. Let's keep things professional and don't adress me unless it's something extremely important\". He thank me for being direct and left me alone.\n\nToday, he came by again and asked me if I wanted to talk. I told him that we had nothing to talk about, and he just left giving me the dirty eye. The thing is, I feel like I was too drastic with my responses and that I made a big deal out of it, yet, I believe he is being incredibly disrespectful to his wife and that he doesn't deserve any soft treatment.

And fuck this guy for trying to cheat especially after being freshly married\n\nThank you for your comment.  \nI can't help but feel extremely sorry for his wife. They've been married for a year and a half and she seems to have given everything to him: His job, his car and even the house where he lives, everything he has it's thanks to her (His words, not mine). And I'm not saying there's anything wrong in supporting one's partner, but to cheat (Or attempt to) on her is such a low, coward move after all she has done for him.

He tends to stalk the people that interact with him. Ex.: Found my instagram handle in a way that almost made me delete the whole account out of fear, congratulated a girl for getting offically hired when she hadn't told anyone, etc.   \nRegarding your question about whether he could get me into trouble or not, my answer is that I don't think so.

Being too friendly sometimes backfires haha", "Thank you for your kind words!   \nI will eventually, as a woman, I absolutely should.", "I think you handled it perfectly.", "That may be why he's trying to cheat. Some guys are extremely insecure and feel emasculated if their wives are the main providers, and end up cheating just to feel like a Real Man again. It's pathetic and you're completely right to say exactly what you did.", "I think it is time to record his little seduction attempts on the sly and send a copy to his wife...and the owner of the shop.", "\" my boss installed a camera with audio recording\"\n\nGood to hear. I too feel bad for the wife.:-(", "Hi! I actually have her instagram handle and the phone number of her father (For business reasons, he gave it to me), but I don't want to act on it quite yet. Even though their store and mine are two different entities and we do not have a common employer, I don't want to risk getting involved in a huge family drama while I'm still working here. Once I leave, I surely will. She deserves better."]}
