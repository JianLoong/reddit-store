But even if they were guests, expecting you to serve them hand and foot all day, and reacting with shouting and insults when you tell them that you can't right now would be wildly unreasonable.\n\nI'm not going to say something like \"kick them to the curb,\" bc they do matter to you presumably.

Stop doing anything for them beyond the basics (like cooking meals or what have you), and let them stew in their silence.\n\nIf you want to be petty, post a chore schedule for them to clean their own rooms and/or leave a broom out conspicuously for them, and ignore any further attempts to get you to do anything with a frosty \"I will speak to you when you respect myself, my family, and my home.\"", "NTA\n\nKick them out.\n\nParents or no, people who scream at you, abuse your hospitality, and give you the silent treatment do not belong in your home.

It was normal stuff. Pick up after yourself, if you see someone needs help with dinner or whatever you help or at least offer.  You behave yourself and be polite . You stay for weeks at a time , you help with dishes and laundry.\n\n My house was the go-to spot for my friends as well as my sisters friends.

It\u2019s upsetting and confusing for young children to hear their parents insulted, they don\u2019t understand and feel it personally since they are so dependent on their mum and dad.
