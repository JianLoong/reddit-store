We have the room and everyone besides my grandmother can care for themselves. It did make things alittle crowded with 5 adults, 2 kids(1m, 5m) and our dog, but we managed since it wasn't supposed to be for long. \n\nThings spiraled quick tho and I ended up having to care for everyone. From the moment I wake up each morning, it's nothing but \"OP can you do this\" \"OP can you do that\" \"OP, you should do this or that\". I don't even have the chance to sit down and eat until everyone is in bed and forget time with just my husband and kids. It got worse a few days ago when we found out our dog is very sick and needs round the clock care for awhile.\n\nThe final straw was when my mom started complaining that the house wasn't clean enough. I sat everyone down and told them I need a break and I was now expecting everyone to pull their weight around the house. I wasn't asking anyone to do any chores, just pick up after themselves and if they needed something while I was busy, to get it themselves. This started a screaming match with my mom with her calling me a lazy bitch because they are guests. I screamed back that yes, this was MY house but I'm not THEIR servant.\n\nMy parents are now not speaking to me and my family is saying I was way out of line for losing it the way I did because that's my parents.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698286867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17glzoo/aita_for_losing_it_on_my_family/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But even if they were guests, expecting you to serve them hand and foot all day, and reacting with shouting and insults when you tell them that you can't right now would be wildly unreasonable.\n\nI'm not going to say something like \"kick them to the curb,\" bc they do matter to you presumably. But I would suggest informing your family that if your parents choose to act like tantrum throwing toddlers you do not feel the need to treat them like your respected elders while they are under your roof, and that is said family members object to you standing up for yourself they are quite welcome to take your parents in instead.\n\nAs for the silent treatment...sounds good to me. Stop doing anything for them beyond the basics (like cooking meals or what have you), and let them stew in their silence.\n\nIf you want to be petty, post a chore schedule for them to clean their own rooms and/or leave a broom out conspicuously for them, and ignore any further attempts to get you to do anything with a frosty \"I will speak to you when you respect myself, my family, and my home.\"", "NTA\n\nKick them out.\n\nParents or no, people who scream at you, abuse your hospitality, and give you the silent treatment do not belong in your home. Give them warning, but be firm, and stick by it. And stop catering to them in the meantime. They should absolutely have chores and you should not be cooking/cleaning/babysitting these grown ass, entitled, adults. \n\nBTW, they aren't guests, they're using your hospitality because they're homeless. Those are **very** different things.", "Wait, the moment they become guests, they lose the ability to do anything for themselves? That\u2019s unique.

They are not visiting.  They are living there because otherwise they would be homeless.  They are not guests in the traditional sense.  Besides it is very bad manners for long term guests to not pitch in and help the household along.  So there is that, they are bad guests and equally bad family to dump everything on you.  Then they made it worse by yelling at you.  Don\u2019t be mad about the silence, take it as a nice break from all the demands.", "NTA\n\nAre they helping financially with household expenses?\n\nThey are NOT guests.

Or do they?\n\nTime for a family meeting.  It's WAY past time to make a chore chart.  Everyone needs to be on it.\n\nIf your parents don't like it, let them find someplace else to live.
