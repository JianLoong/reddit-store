She\u2019s having unprotected sex in her parent\u2019s house - not her own private home. She\u2019s sneaking a strange guy into her parents house, then into her room. 100% certain the parents wouldn\u2019t be okay with it happening. So, considering she still lives under her parent\u2019s roof, I think this is a problem on its own right", "More like birth control since OP's sister's creepy boyfriend refuses to use condoms because \"it doesn't feel the same\"", "The problem is that she's a dumb 18 year old that is sleeping with a creepy 24 year old who doesn't respect women. Doing whatever possible to shield her from him is the right answer until she grows up.", "Clearly, she would ideally break up with this AH. But you\u2019re not going to be able to make her do it and trying to tell her how to run her life is likely to make her dig in her heels. Your goal is to make her see you as an ally, not an enemy.\n\nWhen you\u2019re both calm, apologize to her for trying to tell her what to do and give her access to accurate information about birth control and STD\u2019s. I believe Planned Parenthood\u2019s website has some excellent information aimed at teenagers. She ought to be using highly effective and reliable birth control (better than condom alone) AND condoms. I\u2019d focus on the bc first, because it\u2019s going to be easier to convince her to do that. Offer to take her to PP for birth control if going to her gyn (assuming she has one) for bc is going to be a problem because your parents get the bills. PP provides care on a sliding scale and she won\u2019t be the first person they\u2019ve seen in her situation.", "What's manipulating is a guy in his mid 20s telling a teenager the pull out method is as good as a condom. She is right to be concerned and telling the parents is better than her sister getting pregnant from a guy who isn't responsible enough to use a condom because he likes it slightly less.", "Disagree. If she was 17yo and turning 18 next week that would make her actions ok in your mind?", "Starting an argument that ends with \"either quit this relationship or I'll tell your parents\" is going to do nothing useful except cause a rift between you two. It's also childish. You're both legally adults, you can talk about this without giving ultimatums or threatening to tattle.", "So you say the guy's a creep but then say it's bad to actually try to do something about it. If he's a creep and a predator, why should a sister silently sit by?", "Never said in my reply she should tell the parents- so hold the \"come on\". Read it again- I said Gyno, book, and BC.", "Yes, she's a dumb 18 year old and the boyfriend is a creep. But pushing her away with an ultimatum like that instead of helping her with information is just going to make her double-down and be stubborn.", "Most of us have been young and dumb, she will learn from her mistakes.", "It\u2019s still not her decision to make over who her sister sleeps with.", "I don\u2019t think you meant to reply to my comment but I concur\u2026", "I guess it's a sticky wicket as she's technically an adult but still lives at home.  I offered some solutions to help her sister without causing an untenable living situation, telling the parents and getting her sister grounded, locked in her room, or even kicked out would just drive this girl into his arms.", "But OP is threatening to tell the parents! It\u2019s in the title of the thread. Either OP is lying to her sister to get her to stop having unprotected sex (which is a terrible and manipulative way to handle this!) or OP is actually willing to follow through on the threat and probably make her sister\u2019s life worse.", "You said NTA... And OP is asking if they'd be the asshole if they told their parents.", "Learning from her mistakes? Would that be a really serious case of STD or a pregnancy which probably gets her kicked out (considering sex is a taboo topic in their family)? The consequences of leaving this unaddressed are too serious and I can only imagine how anxious I'd be if my sister was making such a huge but avoidable mistake. \n\nOP, telling you parents might be a bit extreme. Do you know someone who is older than both of you, someone who your sister might respect or listen to that can talk to her? Also, please get her resources on sex ed. She is clearly being taken advantage of because of her lack of knowledge. Let her know you love her and care for her.\n\nEdit: typos", "The mistake is a Kid, which most likely won\u2019t be aborted and will live a shit life. I\u2019m sorry, nta", "Or he made the threat without thinking it through but realizes that's not the best idea and now isn't sure what to do? And that's why he's asking for advice? NTA", "Aint worse than having a kid when youre unable to properly care for them", "Fair enough- I read into it more as her getting involved and the unprotected sex verses staying out of it.", "Yes learning from her mistakes because what exactly is telling the parents going to do, stop her from having unprotected sex? Because we see that worked out so well in society. The best teacher is to learn from your own mistakes whether you agree or not. I learned more from my own mistakes more than ppl giving me advice I didn\u2019t ask for.\n\nThis is coming from someone who did get pregnant at 18 btw. Guess what? I didn\u2019t have any more kids and my child doesn\u2019t live a crappy life. Things may not be perfect but she definitely has more privileges than I did at her age.", "You\u2019re making assumptions here\u2026", "It is really maddening when people say, \"it worked out for me, therefore it must be good for everybody.\" It sucks to pay for mistakes that you made because you didn't know any better. It sucks when people take advantage of you and loved ones stand by and let it happen. \n\nIf OP tries to have a calm, grown up discussion with her sis and helps her with knowledge that she doesn't have and the sis still doesn't listen, then it is her own fault. It is not okay for OP to stand by and say nothing.", "Conservative parents +teen pregnancy statistically leads to a shit life for the kid", "You don\u2019t have to agree. All I\u2019m saying is I learned from my mistakes and learning from my mistakes is the best teacher which it is. I feel like you are taking this too personally. The sister is legally an adult. OP nor her parents can\u2019t make her do anything. Even if she was still a minor they cannot force her to use birth control because even teenagers under 18 have rights. The only thing they can do is encourage, not scold or threaten which is what the OP is doing. That has never been an effective method. Having someone learn from their mistakes is more effective than that.\n\nYou\u2019re also contradicting what I\u2019m saying. If she doesn\u2019t listen it is her fault as you said. Of course and that is a mistake she will ultimately learn from", "If you say so\u2026", "We all learn from our mistakes and are better for it.\n\nAs far as legality is considered, it depends on where OP is from. I don't know if sex being a taboo subject is culture specific or family specific for them. Where I come from, it is culture-specific. Here, if the parents find out that a girl is pregnant before marriage, a hush-hush forced abortion is the best outcome she can hope for, legality be damned, and then a quick marriage to the next available guy.... And this happens in highly educated, well off families.\n\nThe consequences of OP's sis actions can vary vastly based on where she is from and how laws are enforced in her region.", "I mean, the pull out method only goes so far\u2026 until it doesn't. Which is more often than not.", "Well assuming they live in the US, 18 is the legal age for 47 states.", "US of A is not the only country on the planet. It's not the largest or the most populous one either. However, you're free to assume.\n\nEdit: typo"]}
