HOWEVER, noise is a big part of apartment/condo/townhome/rowhome living, though.

Long story short, I go to the police station  (I have a kid and wife, and thought if he thought I was trying to purposely kill him that he might kill me first), nothing they can do, they tell me it\u2019s legal to be crazy and own a gun, so they can\u2019t check and take one away.
