Anything that describes itself as a \"wellness\" community/group/company is de facto a scam, because the word itself is amorphous and has no real meaning, and can be defined however it suits them (and however gets the dollars out of your pocket).", "Girl, I'm so sorry for what you went through growing up.  Your family clearly didn't and still don't understand what you want through and the role they played in your depression. BUT that being said, \"Wellness groups\" and the like often prey upon people like you who may be searching for love, acceptance, self-esteem, belonging, etc etc.\" Could be a cult or could be an organization that's meant to take your money in exchange for some non-sense new age philosophy that relies on toxic positivity. Be careful.", "YTA. \nWhy would you pay for something before knowing for sure your family would want to come?\nI think it's great that you found something that you are excited for but it's clearly something just for you. You said yourself it's a new start.\nAnd it does kind of sound like a pyramid scheme considering they tried to get you to convince friends and family to join you from the get go.", "YTA\n\n*Inviting* your family would have been fine, but that's not what you did.  Inviting your family would have been \"Hey family, I am doing this thing, would you like to go?  If so, I will get us tickets.\"\n\nBy buying the tickets FIRST, you put pressure on them to attend with you.  And seeing as how you did this without gauging whether they were interested in the group, interested in taking a trip, etc.; you put them in a shitty position.  They aren't interested, and no one likes to feel pressured into attending a \"wellness group\" they aren't comfortable with.\n\nIf the group encouraged you to do this, they likely are sketchy.  High pressure \"invites\" like this are tactics these groups encourage to maximize attendance.  They hope some people will attend out of a feeling of obligation.  But it is rude to do to people, and while your family's reaction was a bit much...it sounds like this maybe isn't the first time and they are sick of your high-pressure \"invites\" to join things they aren't interested in.", "Gently, OP, YTA.  One thing you\u2019re not accounting for : You didn\u2019t *ask* your relatives if they were interested in taking a trip across the country for any reason whatsoever. Very presumptuous of you.", "INFO: Is this a cult? Have you looked into this \"wellness group?\" I mean, I don't see how you can expect your family to travel across the county to go to a random festival. I don't think anyone is an AH here really.", "YTA. Not for wanting to bond with your family but for *assuming* they would come, paying for them, and not asking them. \n\nPlease be wary of pay to play \u201cwellness\u201d groups that want you to recruit or invite as many people as you can. I know you\u2019re excited but approach any paying group with extreme scrutiny.", "Uh, **INFO**: What is this wellness group called, exactly? And also, why on Earth would you go ahead and buy tickets to an event *on the other side of the country* before even checking that they would be able, let alone willing, to come?\n\nI mean...man. I don't know your family so I can't comment on how they've treated you, but your own behaviour is so irrational and impulsive that I have to wonder just how accurate this story is coming from your lens.", "YTA- Do not book trips for people without asking. Do not assume people will join your cult without asking.", "This not a relationship i would call cordial. If those people don't care about you and are bad for your mental health cut them off.", "Is this group recognized or accredited by any national, international or local mental health or medical organizations? This sounds like they may be taking your money and returning little to nothing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Given their history, though, it\u2019s sadly not surprising. I\u2019m going with NTA here, but I\u2019d really take a second look at (1) this group you are now giving your money to and (2) assuming your family will drop everything to support you in any way.", "NTA but you shouldn't have paid for them without knowing for sure that they would come. And please be careful, I understand wanting to find a community you feel accepted and understood in, but it could really be dangerous and potentially have ulterior motives.
