Of course if it's one in a long string of offensive comments, that's a different story. But I have the feeling he doesn't even remember what he said before.

If something has offended you and you\u2019ve asked them to stop and they don\u2019t, then you don\u2019t have to stand for it.  It\u2019s not appropriate to bring up a guest\u2019s ex partner, and guest\u2019s sexual orientation at the dinner table.  I don\u2019t know why people like to ask intrusive questions about others sex lives or make unsolicited comments.  They laugh at their own jokes, they always act as if theirs is the first time it\u2019s been told.  It\u2019s not just asking questions, it\u2019s them getting a kick out of it."]}
