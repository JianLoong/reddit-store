I've learned during that time that \"tofu\" is a cultural food in many cultures that actually call it \"tahu\". One of my friends, Alex [24/f], would ask me (it always seemed she was joking) to call tofu by the right name, tahu, almost everytime I mentioned tofu. It started getting annoying and I would just outright ignore her \"jokes\" and not even respond anymore.\n\nA while ago, the same thing happened, but this time she got mad when I decided to completely ignore her and continue talking about what I was before she interjected. It was a long-drawn-out argument but basically, she said I was being disrespectful. I said I was calling it by the name that's well-known and is written on 99% of the packages I buy and see at different stores. \n\nShe said since I'm not friends or spend much time someone who is actually from a culture that calls it tofu, I should call it tahu because I'm closer to a person, her, who calls it that. I thought that was just dumb and told her that. It seems so silly to have use the word tahu and then have to explain it to people as \"it the same thing as tofu\", instead of just using the word that most people are familiar with. \n\nI also said it would be a hassle and hard to suddenly call it a different name. This is where my other friend decided to interject and say \"you easily managed to refer to me as \"they\" instead of \"she\", you can do this this too but you're clearly just being stubborn\". I was kinda shocked and even said that her pronoun change is more of an issue than this tofu issue. She said it is similar even if it a lesser issue than pronouns because it shows that I don't respect Alex.\n\nMy two other friends who were there during this are on my side, but refused to defend me directly during the argument. They both say I'm right but one of them asked me to just apologize to Alex and try to call the food tahu, at least around her because it was clearly something she was sensitive about. I honestly would do that and keep the peace if I knew she truly cared about this, but I feel like this is some weird attempt to try and control and police me and I'm worried if I do what she asked me, she'll just continue to ask unreasonable things of me and try to make me out to be the bad guy like she is doing now. \n\nOn the other hand, she is the only one in this group that is from a different country while the rest of us are American (3 white and 1 black) so maybe I'm missing something and just being an ignorant asshole?

Alex may have a personal or cultural connection to the food that you do not understand or value. You are also dismissing Alex's request as a joke or an attempt to control you, instead of trying to listen and learn from their perspective. You are also comparing Alex's request to your other friend's pronoun change, which is not a fair or relevant comparison. Pronouns are related to one's gender identity and expression, which are fundamental aspects of one's selfhood and dignity. Tofu/tahu is a food item that has different names in different languages and cultures. While both issues involve respect and recognition, they are not on the same level of importance or sensitivity.\n\nTherefore, I think you should apologize to Alex and try to call the food tahu when you are around her. This would show that you care about your friendship and respect the cultural differences. It would also be a gesture of learning and openness, as you would be exposed to a new word and a new aspect of Alex's culture. Calling the food tahu would not be a hassle or a hardship for you, as you are already familiar with the food and its properties. It would just be a matter of changing one word in your vocabulary, which you have done before for your other friend's pronouns. It would also not be confusing or misleading for other people, as you can easily explain that tahu is another name for tofu in some cultures. Calling the food tahu would not take away anything from your enjoyment or experience of eating it. It would just add another layer of meaning and appreciation for the food and its origins.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Our friend is trying to police my language about something that really is not a problem in the world, tofu is the acceptable term for it and is a more direct translation of it's original name than tahu is so if anyone is disrespecting the culture it's not the people calling it tofu.

Calling it tofu isn't disrespectful to any cultures and while _friend_ may call it something else, not calling it that isn't disrespectful to her culture because at the end of the day it didn't come from her culture and tofu itself doesn't have feelings so there is no reason to change. It may hurt _friends_ feelings but that is the definition of a you problem. The world has millions of languages, as words transfer from language to language the pronunciation varys, that's just how languages work, referring to something with the pronunciation that is most common in your language is not a diss or some sort of cultural appropriation.

I could see a Chinese person having a *slight* point on this, just in that it's a little unfair that the western world calls tofu by the Japanese name even though China *invented* it (both the word and the food).

You are the epitome of that stat. Hell, they even spend tens of thousands of dollars a year to rub shoulders and network with other rich white men at the country club. \n\nNot to mention how insulting that made up stat is, how much it inherently looks down on Asian countries by implying that those, too, are run by rich white men.\n\nIt's infuriating.
