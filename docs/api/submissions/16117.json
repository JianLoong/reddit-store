I have rented out 10 villas and apartments in a luxury resort. There is about 40 of us going. My brother (Ethan 44) called me and said he was talking to our other brother (Aaron 48) when the subject of the holiday came up and Aaron told him I hadn't invited him. Thing is we all used to be pretty close and when Ethan moved abroad me & Aaron became real close. We would go out at least once a week and call and text often then about 6 years ago Aaron met Lucy after this our contact went to almost zero. I messaged him about it saying I missed him and how I hate that we didn't talk and how I enjoyed his company and wanted a relationship. I understood that it wouldn't be like before but just asked if he could make time for me occasionally. He went off at me saying how he does have other people he wants to spend time with. Well that was that, since that time we have seen each other at some family events (he often doesn't attend these) but haven't really spoken just hellos and goodbyes. Well now he asked Ethan to talk to me about letting him and Lucy come away with us. I have paid for everything for everyone and could easily invite him but I don't want to he only wants to know now because I have money but my dad & Ethan think I'm being petty because almost every member of our family is going even Aaron's kids with their partners and Aarons's grandchild. They are saying its a once in a lifetime holiday and leaving him out is worse than him not inviting me for a few drinks at the local as everyone is very excited and it will be a topic of conversation for long time but I don't agree if he didn't want to hang out with me when I was poor he doesn't get to change his mind because I have money.", "created_utc": 1682936543, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134ijtj/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_on_a_family/", "score": 778, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you hadn't been paying for this holiday, would he have wanted to be in contact with you?", "NTA. He wants to go on the trip. He doesn't want to spend time with you. You don't owe him or his partner the trip. It's your money. \n\nHowever, be prepared for people to think you are being petty, and your relationship with A and L will get worse. If you don't care about those consequences, then enjoy the trip without A and L.\n\nI'm not being sarcastic. I have a sibling that no one in the family can take for more than 5 minutes. I have done the same thing you are planning, but I didn't second guess it. Some family members made comments, but when I asked them if she would have ruined the trip, they all agree that she would. So I asked them to zip it, and they did. I have no regrets. You are in a different situation, so will you regret it?", "NTA. \n\nIt seems like they only care about you because you have money now.

Everyone who disappeared and didn't ever talk to you again all of a sudden want to be in your life just long enough to go on a nice trip.

Now, all this sudden YOU have to be the peace keeper because your brother wants a free vacation. \nSorry, but I feel like, if you weren\u2019t an active part in my life before money, you don\u2019t get to be after. I get parents want all their kids together, but that\u2019s not on you. If your brother wasn\u2019t selfish in the first place, it wouldn\u2019t be like this. He doesn\u2019t get to treat you like crap and expect to reap your rewards because you share the same parents. \nPeople can say what they want, but it\u2019s not on you to extend the olive branch in this situation. It\u2019s literally only rewarding bad behavior. \nI mean, IF you do go ahead and invite him and his family, where will the entitlement end? If it were me, I would want to know this relationship could be fixed before I did anything for my brother. (If that\u2019s what you want) You need to know if you\u2019re going to be used.

Littlest one was still was happy to see him and recognized him. Because even though we couldn't visit, we still talked. FaceTime has been around for over a decade, and Zoom made things easier too. Every week, without fail, we SAW FIL, so Little One knew him. We had hour long conversations every week, plus texts. \n\nYou didn't have to drive over to where he was (or vice-versa). You didn't have to schedule travel time and time off and make accomodations to visit each other. It's as simple as being a phone call away. \n\nYes, you stopped calling, but he never bothered to pick up the phone either. NOW he picks up the phone. Because a nice holiday is up for grabs. When's the last family gathering he attended?", "Nta. After all, he has other people he can spend time with!! This is exactly why I am claiming my money under an LLC when I win the lottery. Nobody should ever know you have money.", "I agree with this. Definitely NTA.\nAlso, the fact that he couldn\u2019t even call OP and talk to her himself is very telling. At the very least he could have called and ask to get together for drinks, catch up\u2026 and apologize!!!! But, nope\u2026 he got the other brother to do the dirty work. Bet he would ignore OP the entire vacation too if he went. \nDo not invite him. He doesn\u2019t deserve it.", "Never ceases to amaze me how many people crawl out of the woodwork in the name of \u201cfamily\u201d when money comes into play.", "This. OR, OP you could \"graciously\" let him know the cost if he and his partner want to come, and if they pay it, allow them to be there. If it's about family bonding and all of that, versus a free vacation, they should be fine with that!", "OP is NTA but he sure needs to [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/24vo34/comment/chb4yin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  Even for those of us who don't win life-changing amounts of money, this is a great read.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems like they only care about you because you have money now.", "It seems that A still doesn\u2019t want contact with OP.  From the post, it looks like he\u2019s asked E and their dad to intervene on his behalf, but hasn\u2019t actually contacted OP directly.\n\nIf OP lets him come, he\u2019ll enjoy the trip then drop out of her life until the next time he needs/wants something expensive.", "I mean... He's still not in contact with her... He sent a 3rd party to do his bidding instead of just texting OP himself like a grown up. \n\nNTA.", "It will impact how other family members see OP, so that\u2019s a good point. I also think that OP might want to consider whether they would invite A for the sake of A\u2019s kids and grandkids.", "He has to pay for himself and his partner. It's your money and you can decide how to spend it.  Enjoy your holiday with people who actually want to spend time with you.", "Why would she want a relationship with someone who clearly said they aren\u2019t interested in spending time with her? Why should she trust any relationship that develops out of her paying for him?", "She shouldn't have to buy a relationship with her brother. \n\nBesides, if the brother is seeing dollar signs, he'll try to worm his way in through another door.", "Ugh. Mind your business. OP didn\u2019t ask your opinion on her finances. The nerve.", ">\tYour life will only change for like 2 years max if this is how you use it.\n\nIt\u2019s so weird for you to make this assumption without knowing how much OP won.  I\u2019m all for frugality and saving for the future, but I wouldn\u2019t assume OP is not doing that based on what they\u2019ve posted here.", "I'd probably do the same, if OP wants to have a relationship with him.  If they're done, then I wouldn't extend the invite, but if they want to try to have anything in the future, I'd reach out and see how it goes.  Obviously the brother wants the free vacation, but maybe make them grovel a bit first.  Tell him how hurtful his words have been, question why there's been no relationship for years now, and ask why he didn't contact OP directly but instead made the other brother do it.", "I love my family and we have always been very close it never occurred to me that I would hide it from them. As I said the money is life changing and although I have no plans to waste it or be financially irresponsible I am happy and want to help make their lives easier. I have helped my niece with her uni fees. Helped my Nephew with a deposit on a (reasonable) house that he will then pay the mortgage and set up funds for my other 2 (minor) nieces to be able to go to university should they wish. Other than that not one member of the family has asked for a single thing nor do I plan on any other extravagant gifts. Also only my partner and my children know the exact amount we have.", "It seems more like OP just doesn\u2019t want to pay for him, not that OP necessarily minds him going. I wonder if OP would be ok with him going if the rest of the family chipped in for his cost. \n\nAfter all, if the family wants him there, the family can pay for it. If the family doesn\u2019t want to pay, the family doesn\u2019t really want him there. It\u2019s easy to be free with someone else\u2019s money- you\u2019re doing, the family is doing it.\n\nActions have consequences and the brother chose this consequence after his daily actions of ignoring OP for 6 years.", "There is not a single person coming on this trip that I didn't see/speak to regularly before I got the money.", "Her brother pretty much told her that she wasn\u2019t worth spending time with.  You don\u2019t think that\u2019s worth excluding him from the vacation she\u2019s paying for?", "Yes his spouse is L they're not married but together and he has 2 grown children and 1 toddler grandson. His children their partners and his grandson are coming away with us", "He doesn\u2019t get to treat you like crap and expect to reap your rewards because you share the same parents.", "Aaah the old \u201cwhat to do when becomming rich\u201d one of my favourite post. Defenitly worth a read for the few who haven\u2019t read it yet.", "Hahaha I fucking dread any form of drama and hate trying to sort through who is actually there to be my friend and who is there because of my cash. \n\nI worked as a plumber and it was honestly similar to having millions of dollars because everyone needed me to fix their shit but only really called me when they needed my help. I had other friends who I thought were legit friends because we hung out for other things, but when I stopped doing that work due to injury ending my career, those people disappeared. It was horrendously shitty feeling knowing all those people just wanted me for my skills. I have no interest in repeating that feeling.", "Is she buying a relationship with the rest of the family she is bringing on the trip? It's less about the money and more about being left out, I think. Again, A left OP out of his left first, and OP can do whatever she wants. But they were not NC yet, and this seems like a weird time to do that.", "I'm relieved to hear that you have sought out financial advice. While this trip sounds lovely and may cost less than 1% of the total of what you have, from here on out focus on securing only your and your children's futures. This brewhaha between your estranged brother and family goes to show people will expect things they clearly don't deserve and cause difficulty you don't need. Protect your peace and security above all else. Big hugs and best wishes for your healthy future\ud83d\udc97", "I think they are also referencing you may be flashing your new wealth which will put you ina a lot of awkward situations with family.   This is only the first problem of many surrounding your money and your family their expectations.", "I'm glad you have it invested properly and paid off your house.  \n\nOne issue though is that you told everyone.  Be prepared for everyone to expect you to pay for everything from now on.   There's a reason people keep it a secret.  \n\nSurgery coming up?  They'll expect you to pay.  \n\nStuck in credit card debt?  Call up Uncle Many-Bucks!\n\nDidn't save up retirement at all and blowing SS checks on junk?  No way our son would let that happen! \n\nEveryone will expect help with house downpayments, future vacations, retirement, school tuition, etc.   They already are acting entitled to your money to invite your brother on a trip.", "It's part of the post.  It's open for discussion.  \n\nIf people don't want opinions on a subject that's part of a story, then they shouldn't post it.  \n\nThis is literally a judgement sub.", "Because even with millions and millions, lottery winners usually don't keep it for more than a couple years.   What I said was based on real world examples.  \n\nYou recommend not using the real world situations to learn from?", "Yep, pretty much my angle too.", "That's an excellent point. I wonder how she would respond if she didn't have to pay. Seems like a good compromise if it's possible.", "Eh. \u201cPay for my extravagant vacation even though I openly dislike you or else I will stop saying hello to you at family functions\u201d isn\u2019t much of a motivation (:", "That\u2019s so awful. I\u2019m sorry those people were so selfish.", "Sure, you can learn from the real-world examples and be cautious.  The tone of your comment was definitive though - not cautionary.  You said she was an AH and was pissing her money away, when you didn\u2019t know that was the case.", "I wouldn't do it, but some might feel differently.", "Happens to a lot of trades people, and I imagine winning the lottery would be a lot worse. I was so relieved when I got out of the trades, even if it took a major back injury hahaha", "To himself.  An AH to himself.  Not outwardly to others.", "NTA. He does have other people in his life. Isn't that what he told you? But you hit the lottery and now he has time for you. Ain't nobody got time for that.", "Nta", "NTA and you should remind your family that YOU are paying for the vacation, and they should be damn grateful and shove out of your business", "NTA.", "NTA I hate when people say \"well, you have the money.\" Damn straight you do, that's why you are doing what you want with it, if THEY WANT someone else to go on the trip then they should put up the money or stop complaining.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid. You can't tell someone to essentially go away and then expect them to bring you on vacations and such after the fact.", "NTA, be PETTY OP. He didn\u2019t have the balls to even call you to ask instead he sends your other brother and your dad to do his work for him. Don\u2019t invite him. Even if you invite I guarantee he will barely speak with you if at all. Let him watch while everyone goes and he doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s what he deserves for treating you like that.", "Any relationship requires effort. Some times it\u2019s a bit unbalanced (one party puts in more effort than the other but generally it requires SOME effort). Your brother has not been willing to put in ANY effort. Even now he is not even suggesting he pay or contribute to the trip so that he can be there with you\u2026. because he doesn\u2019t care about being there with YOU. Other family meme et got a free trip and he thinks he is owed one too. Well, he\u2019s not. I would tell him if he is interested in building a relationship you\u2019re willing but it won\u2019t start with your money.", "NTA. If we wanted to be part of the family he could have made an effort before it directly benefitted him. Don\u2019t let anyone try and guilt you into thinking he\u2019s looking for anything more than a free vacation. Maybe invite them if they can provide their own travel and lodging, see how much they really want to come", "Nta. Tell anyone who has a problem with your decision to not invite him that they're more than welcome to stay at home with him and plan their own vacation with their own money.", "INFO Do you mind me asking-- when your brother met Lucy how did the two of you get along?  Did you approve of their relationship?  Was she friendly with your or was she resentful of the time you spent with your brother? How much would it mean for your dad to have a vacation with all his kids (you don't mention your mom so I'm assuming she's somehow out of the picture.)   \n\nI think your brother is an AH for turning his back on you for six years and suddenly remembering your alive when the chance for a luxury vacation rears it's head.  I think your other bro is AH adjacent for trying to guilt you into including someone who has treated you so poorly.  I'm giving your dad a free pass because when you hit a certain age making memories with the whole family means a lot--and even though I feel it's your choice to include your brother and Lucy or not, I can still understand him wanting them included.", "If Ethan and your dad keep nagging you, threaten to disinvite them if continue.\n\nNTA", "I'm sorry I'm going to go with ESH.  It is certainly within your rights to do this and you don't owe them anything, but you have also set up the situation in a way that not inviting them is a retaliatory act instead of just neutral.  You haven't given any indication that their presence would be negative in any way (and I think in most cases it would be the expense that would be the hardship, but you've indicated this isn't one).  It sounds like you just don't think he deserves to come.  So what is your goal?  To teach him a lesson?  Does that actually benefit you?", "I find it so hard to follow when people do the E, A L thing. Just use fake names! Y T A for that", "I think it\u2019s mean of you to leave him out. Your being petty.", "YTA, in a strange, philanthropic way.\n\nIt doesn't hurt you to invite him along, despite your feelings having been hurt/him belittling you. He's an ass, and matching his energy only makes you an ass too. I wish you the best with your relationships moving forward. Congratulations.", "YTA. Are you sure you didn't plan this whole elaborate family vacation without Aaron just to punish him? Aren't you secretly pleased this bothers him? How long have you been holding onto this grudge? If you truly wanted to reconnect you'd invite him and Lucy to come along.", "So let me get this straight. Your brother got married had a family and became distant and you\u2019re punishing him for that? It sounds like his life got busy and you decided to cut him off for it. Things happen and maybe just maybe he had a lot on his plate, family members can drift apart as life happens. He shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you that ONE time but you give no info on what has been done between that time and now. You make it sound like things were fine between y\u2019all since then just that you didn\u2019t hang out outside of family events. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I find it very very hard to make time for my parents/grandparents/siblings in my life. I have a fianc\u00e9 and kids and friends and work and everything else life throws at me. You\u2019re being very petty imo. YTA.", "Could he just have been spending time with the person he fell in love with and didn't have as much time as before? It sounds like you just cut him off because he wouldn't spend time with you. You wouldn't even speak to him. \n\nI always assume when people first get together they tend to give each other all their attention. That whole blind to everybody but them phase of a relationship.That newness fades after a while, however it sounds like you didn't want to wait until this happened. \n\nI think it's crappy to take everyone in your family and your friends and pointedly leave him out to be petty. I honestly don't think it's a matter of not wanting to see you, I think you wanted too much of his time when he was starting a new relationship and didn't understand where he was coming from.\n\nAre you willing to sit down and discuss things with your brother? If not then this post is moot. I always advise talking things out rather than running away.", "I don\u2019t know why people tell anyone they won money.

He wanted no relationship with you but now wants a free vacation. That\u2019s not right.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't even ask you himself which is telling! If he was genuine, he would have called you and apologized. But going around and having your father and other brother play messenger for him? That's shady. I mean invite him if you want but I would go in with clarity of who he is. He's the type of person who only likes when you do something for him.", "NTA", "NTA but I would invite Ethan but not Lucy. He practically cut off his entire family for her. Either you are a very toxic family or I would make sure Lucy isn\u2019t abusive. He may just have a new life that he prefers, but as a sibling, I would at least make sure. Tell him that since he has prioritized Lucy over his family for 6 years, then he can prioritize his family for this one occasion, and that Lucy won\u2019t be invited because you do not believe that he will spend time with the family if she comes.", "Does Aaron even want to go?

He hasn't even called you to apologize for cutting you out. He is asking others to talk to you but he can't be bothered to talk to you? No, he doesn't want a relationship with you, just the trip. I wouldn't pay for someone to go who doesn't want a relationship with me.", "NTA.  Invite him and say he has to pay his own way, see what he says then.

There was a 6 month period we didn't see him at all which was a 1st for our whole lifetimes. Everyone would say things \"Ooh Aaron hasn't turned up again\" I never wanted us to fall out if anything I thought I would say to his face what everyone else was saying behind his back. I kinda just thought if I pointed it out to him he would make the effort. Once he said the \"I have other people to spend time with\" I took a major step back. I love my family and I love my friends but I'm not going to force someone who doesn't want to spend time with me to do so.

I wrote him a letter telling him how much I miss him, how no one can make me laugh the way he can and that I just wanted a sibling relationship. I put this letter inside his birthday card which I placed in his hand and had absolute no reply. Three months after I sent him that he missed my engagement party to go to Lucy's cousins husbands 30th.
