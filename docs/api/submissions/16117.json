I have rented out 10 villas and apartments in a luxury resort. There is about 40 of us going. My brother (Ethan 44) called me and said he was talking to our other brother (Aaron 48) when the subject of the holiday came up and Aaron told him I hadn't invited him. Thing is we all used to be pretty close and when Ethan moved abroad me & Aaron became real close. We would go out at least once a week and call and text often then about 6 years ago Aaron met Lucy after this our contact went to almost zero. I messaged him about it saying I missed him and how I hate that we didn't talk and how I enjoyed his company and wanted a relationship. I understood that it wouldn't be like before but just asked if he could make time for me occasionally. He went off at me saying how he does have other people he wants to spend time with. Well that was that, since that time we have seen each other at some family events (he often doesn't attend these) but haven't really spoken just hellos and goodbyes. Well now he asked Ethan to talk to me about letting him and Lucy come away with us. I have paid for everything for everyone and could easily invite him but I don't want to he only wants to know now because I have money but my dad & Ethan think I'm being petty because almost every member of our family is going even Aaron's kids with their partners and Aarons's grandchild. They are saying its a once in a lifetime holiday and leaving him out is worse than him not inviting me for a few drinks at the local as everyone is very excited and it will be a topic of conversation for long time but I don't agree if he didn't want to hang out with me when I was poor he doesn't get to change his mind because I have money.", "created_utc": 1682936543, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134ijtj/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_on_a_family/", "score": 1854, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you hadn't been paying for this holiday, would he have wanted to be in contact with you?", "NTA. He wants to go on the trip. He doesn't want to spend time with you. You don't owe him or his partner the trip. It's your money. \n\nHowever, be prepared for people to think you are being petty, and your relationship with A and L will get worse. If you don't care about those consequences, then enjoy the trip without A and L.\n\nI'm not being sarcastic. I have a sibling that no one in the family can take for more than 5 minutes. I have done the same thing you are planning, but I didn't second guess it. Some family members made comments, but when I asked them if she would have ruined the trip, they all agree that she would. So I asked them to zip it, and they did. I have no regrets. You are in a different situation, so will you regret it?", "NTA. \n\nIt seems like they only care about you because you have money now.

Don't let them take advantage of you or guilt trip you.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe he wouldn\u2019t have thought of this scenario specifically, but he should have thought of the possibility of no longer being included when he decided that his friends were more worthy of his time than his sister. He made that decision. Not you. Enjoy your holiday with people who actually want to spend time with you.", "NTA. This is a big reason I really wouldn't want to win life changing money. Everyone who disappeared and didn't ever talk to you again all of a sudden want to be in your life just long enough to go on a nice trip.

Now, all this sudden YOU have to be the peace keeper because your brother wants a free vacation. \nSorry, but I feel like, if you weren\u2019t an active part in my life before money, you don\u2019t get to be after. I get parents want all their kids together, but that\u2019s not on you. If your brother wasn\u2019t selfish in the first place, it wouldn\u2019t be like this. He doesn\u2019t get to treat you like crap and expect to reap your rewards because you share the same parents. \nPeople can say what they want, but it\u2019s not on you to extend the olive branch in this situation. It\u2019s literally only rewarding bad behavior. \nI mean, IF you do go ahead and invite him and his family, where will the entitlement end? If it were me, I would want to know this relationship could be fixed before I did anything for my brother. (If that\u2019s what you want) You need to know if you\u2019re going to be used.

Littlest one was still was happy to see him and recognized him. Because even though we couldn't visit, we still talked. FaceTime has been around for over a decade, and Zoom made things easier too. Every week, without fail, we SAW FIL, so Little One knew him. We had hour long conversations every week, plus texts. \n\nYou didn't have to drive over to where he was (or vice-versa). You didn't have to schedule travel time and time off and make accomodations to visit each other. It's as simple as being a phone call away. \n\nYes, you stopped calling, but he never bothered to pick up the phone either. NOW he picks up the phone. Because a nice holiday is up for grabs. When's the last family gathering he attended?", "Nta. After all, he has other people he can spend time with!! This is exactly why I am claiming my money under an LLC when I win the lottery. Nobody should ever know you have money.", "I agree with this. Definitely NTA.\nAlso, the fact that he couldn\u2019t even call OP and talk to her himself is very telling. At the very least he could have called and ask to get together for drinks, catch up\u2026 and apologize!!!! But, nope\u2026 he got the other brother to do the dirty work. Bet he would ignore OP the entire vacation too if he went. \nDo not invite him. He doesn\u2019t deserve it.", "Never ceases to amaze me how many people crawl out of the woodwork in the name of \u201cfamily\u201d when money comes into play.", "This.

From the post, it looks like he\u2019s asked E and their dad to intervene on his behalf, but hasn\u2019t actually contacted OP directly.\n\nIf OP lets him come, he\u2019ll enjoy the trip then drop out of her life until the next time he needs/wants something expensive.", "I mean... He's still not in contact with her... He sent a 3rd party to do his bidding instead of just texting OP himself like a grown up. \n\nNTA.", "It will impact how other family members see OP, so that\u2019s a good point.

It's your money and you can decide how to spend it.  Enjoy your holiday with people who actually want to spend time with you.", "Why would she want a relationship with someone who clearly said they aren\u2019t interested in spending time with her? Why should she trust any relationship that develops out of her paying for him?", "She shouldn't have to buy a relationship with her brother. \n\nBesides, if the brother is seeing dollar signs, he'll try to worm his way in through another door.", "Ugh. Mind your business. OP didn\u2019t ask your opinion on her finances. The nerve.", ">\tYour life will only change for like 2 years max if this is how you use it.\n\nIt\u2019s so weird for you to make this assumption without knowing how much OP won.  I\u2019m all for frugality and saving for the future, but I wouldn\u2019t assume OP is not doing that based on what they\u2019ve posted here.", "I'd probably do the same, if OP wants to have a relationship with him.  If they're done, then I wouldn't extend the invite, but if they want to try to have anything in the future, I'd reach out and see how it goes.  Obviously the brother wants the free vacation, but maybe make them grovel a bit first.  Tell him how hurtful his words have been, question why there's been no relationship for years now, and ask why he didn't contact OP directly but instead made the other brother do it.", "I love my family and we have always been very close it never occurred to me that I would hide it from them. As I said the money is life changing and although I have no plans to waste it or be financially irresponsible I am happy and want to help make their lives easier. I have helped my niece with her uni fees. Helped my Nephew with a deposit on a (reasonable) house that he will then pay the mortgage and set up funds for my other 2 (minor) nieces to be able to go to university should they wish. Other than that not one member of the family has asked for a single thing nor do I plan on any other extravagant gifts. Also only my partner and my children know the exact amount we have.", "It seems more like OP just doesn\u2019t want to pay for him, not that OP necessarily minds him going. I wonder if OP would be ok with him going if the rest of the family chipped in for his cost. \n\nAfter all, if the family wants him there, the family can pay for it. If the family doesn\u2019t want to pay, the family doesn\u2019t really want him there. It\u2019s easy to be free with someone else\u2019s money- you\u2019re doing, the family is doing it.\n\nActions have consequences and the brother chose this consequence after his daily actions of ignoring OP for 6 years.", "There is not a single person coming on this trip that I didn't see/speak to regularly before I got the money.", "Her brother pretty much told her that she wasn\u2019t worth spending time with.  You don\u2019t think that\u2019s worth excluding him from the vacation she\u2019s paying for?", "Yes his spouse is L they're not married but together and he has 2 grown children and 1 toddler grandson. His children their partners and his grandson are coming away with us", "He doesn\u2019t get to treat you like crap and expect to reap your rewards because you share the same parents.", "Aaah the old \u201cwhat to do when becomming rich\u201d one of my favourite post. Defenitly worth a read for the few who haven\u2019t read it yet.", "Hahaha I fucking dread any form of drama and hate trying to sort through who is actually there to be my friend and who is there because of my cash. \n\nI worked as a plumber and it was honestly similar to having millions of dollars because everyone needed me to fix their shit but only really called me when they needed my help. I had other friends who I thought were legit friends because we hung out for other things, but when I stopped doing that work due to injury ending my career, those people disappeared. It was horrendously shitty feeling knowing all those people just wanted me for my skills. I have no interest in repeating that feeling.", "Is she buying a relationship with the rest of the family she is bringing on the trip?

But they were not NC yet, and this seems like a weird time to do that.", "I'm relieved to hear that you have sought out financial advice. While this trip sounds lovely and may cost less than 1% of the total of what you have, from here on out focus on securing only your and your children's futures.

Be prepared for everyone to expect you to pay for everything from now on.   There's a reason people keep it a secret.  \n\nSurgery coming up?  They'll expect you to pay.  \n\nStuck in credit card debt?  Call up Uncle Many-Bucks!\n\nDidn't save up retirement at all and blowing SS checks on junk?

That\u2019s what he deserves for treating you like that.", "Any relationship requires effort. Some times it\u2019s a bit unbalanced (one party puts in more effort than the other but generally it requires SOME effort). Your brother has not been willing to put in ANY effort.

How much would it mean for your dad to have a vacation with all his kids (you don't mention your mom so I'm assuming she's somehow out of the picture.)   \n\nI think your brother is an AH for turning his back on you for six years and suddenly remembering your alive when the chance for a luxury vacation rears it's head.  I think your other bro is AH adjacent for trying to guilt you into including someone who has treated you so poorly.

Both kids who are bullied and who bully others may have serious, lasting problems.\n\n\u201cIn order to be considered bullying, the behavior must be aggressive and include:\n\n\u201cAn Imbalance of Power: Kids who bully use their power\u2014such as physical strength, access to embarrassing information, or popularity\u2014to control or harm others. Power imbalances can change over time and in different situations, even if they involve the same people.\n\n\u201cRepetition: Bullying behaviors happen more than once or have the potential to happen more than once.\n\n\u201cBullying includes actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose.\u201d\n\nPlease.

I say this because I imagine renting out villas and paying for 40 people at a luxury resort seems excessive if you are planning on making that money last.", "Nta. Your brother only wants a free vacation. If you invite him, he'd probably either ignore you or act like your buddy for gifts.", "Nta", "NTA\nIf in six years he hasn't made and effort to be in your life, he doesn't deserve an all expenses paid trip.\nTo show there is no hard feelings and please you dad and Ethan, you could extend an invitation to Aaron and Lucy to join the family trip but they pay for themselves. You could text him something like \"Hi Aaron, Ethan said you and Lucy would like to join the family trip. It would be nice for all of us to spend time together and catch up. If you are serious about going let me know, I'll send you trip details so you can book your travel/accommodations\" His reaction will let you know if he is looking for a free trip or really wants to spend time with the family.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI see Lucy behind the scenes trying to get a free holiday.\n\nMake sure you draft your will to leave a token amount to Aaron so he can't contest your wishes.", "NTA, but if you want to consider having a normal relationship with your brother then inviting him would be a good idea", "Tell him you \u201cDO have other people\u201d you \u201cwant to spend time with\u201d\u2026.people will consider you petty but this man crushed your feelings and now wants you to consider his. Now, I\u2019m saying this knowing damn well that if out in the same position I would be conflicted but I\u2019m so irritated by people that think that since they\u2019re family that they are entitled to the same consideration as family members who REMEMBER how to treat family. And Lucy? I\u2019m assuming you never even had the courtesy of being introduced to her\u2026.psssh\u2026N.T.A!", "OP don\u2019t be rude. Invite your brother and kindly tell him how much you paid for rooms and travel so he can be prepared to spend that much to be apart of the family vacation. \n\nJust because you invite him doesn\u2019t mean you have to pay \ud83e\udd70. \n\nI think it\u2019s fair to have a discussion on the subject of you\u2019re more than welcome to join but I won\u2019t be paying. Explain that you\u2019ve reached out, you wanted him in your life but you felt rejected. He didn\u2019t want you in his life - so you moved on and changed the way you feel. It\u2019s really pathetic that now there is something in-it for him and his family comes off super advantageous. And THATS not something you\u2019re willing to participate in. \n\nIf he chooses to stay angry / upset then you can 100% say, he only wants the money not the relationship. I think any well adjusted adult could understand your POV. \n\nIf it\u2019s still weighing heavily on ya I\u2019d suggest subsidizing some of the vacation for them. \n\nOr you can 100% say eff it. I feels the way I feels because honestly and truthfully NTA.", "NTA. You gambled, you won. He gambled, he lost.", "Except A only wants to go because it's a free trip. I would bet that if it was on his own dime, he wouldn't bother.", "But the fact that  only heard about it from their brother. OP said hiss kids and grandkids are going, yet none of them mentioned it to him. Just her other brother. Makes me wonder if his kids are on speaking terms with him. And if they are not, then all the more reason for OP to put her foot down.", "Then the family can chip in and pay for him to come, or he can apologize and offer to pay his own way to be included.", "I do think YTA if you're inviting all the family (essentially) but not him. Sometimes it sucks when you have to be the bigger person, but it might be a good way to bury the hatchet. I think it would be different if it was only a few family members,  but given its his kids as well,  it seems a bit churlish.", "NTA. You can\u2019t be cool enough to hang out with now that you can pay for everything. It\u2019s him using you. And honestly, it\u2019s not like you\u2019d be hanging out on the holiday together now that it\u2019s awkward that he wasn\u2019t invited to begin with.", "Tell the flying monkeys, i.e. Dad and Ethan, if it's so important to them that Aaron and Lucy get to go after SIX YEARS OF NOTHING, then they can relinquish their spots to the two people who ONLY CARE ABOUT THE MONEY, NOT THE SISTER!!!\n\nSee if the rallying cry of \"BUT FAMILEEEEEEE!\" continues when they have to pony up the freight. \n\nStand your ground, and let them know you'll gladly hand over the free rooms to nice, young couples you meet at the airport if they keep trying to force you to change when you were the one treated badly for SIX YEARS!\n\nNTA", "NTA I\u2019d repeat his words back at him.  Say you didn\u2019t invite him because he\u2019s got other people in his life he\u2019d rather spend time with, so you haven\u2019t and aren\u2019t going to force your company on him.", "NTA - He chose NC not you, his bed to lie in. I know 2 wrongs don't make a right but stick to your instincts what kind of holiday would it be if her was there could you relax and have a good time, no probably not. So I agree with no invite for Ethan", "NTA ask those that are complaining if they would give their spot up. Or pay for him to come.", "Why tho? He didn\u2019t even bother asking her, he send other people.", "What relationship?", "NovelNo2778 is a bot that copied this comment from elsewhere in the thread.

Enjoy your vacation \ud83e\udd73", "Your brother just wants a free vacation and is pissed becuase he was not included.  Stand firm, it's your money, your decision.  NTA", "NTA\n\nSounds like Aaron wants an expenses-paid holiday, not a relationship with his sibling. If he didn't want to be treated like someone too distant to invite on an outing, he shouldn't have been too distant to be invited on an outing.", "NTA. Why should you host someone who is going to ignore you and make you feel awkward for the entire vacation? Tell Ethan to tell Aaron that it will be much easier for him to ignore you if he stays home. To appease your father and Ethan, you could offer to send Aaron and Lucy on their own scaled-down vacation by themselves.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
