I have rented out 10 villas and apartments in a luxury resort. There is about 40 of us going. My brother (E44) called me and said he was talking to our other brother (A48) when the subject of the holiday came up and A told him I hadn't invited him. Thing is we all used to be pretty close and when E moved abroad me & A became real close. We would go out at least once a week and call and text often then about 6 years ago A met L after this our contact went to almost zero. I messaged him about it saying I missed him and how I hate that we didn't talk and how I enjoyed his company and wanted a relationship. I understood that it wouldn't be like before but just asked if he could make time for me occasionally. He went off at me saying how he does have other people he wants to spend time with. Well that was that, since that time we have seen each other at some family events (he often doesn't attend these) but haven't really spoken just hellos and goodbyes. Well now he asked E to talk to me about letting him and L come away with us. I have paid for everything for everyone and could easily invite him but I don't want to he only wants to know now because I have money but my dad & E think I'm being petty because almost every member of our family is going even A's kids with their partners and A's grandchild. They are saying its a once in a lifetime holiday and leaving him out is worse than him not inviting me for a few drinks at the local as everyone is very excited and it will be a topic of conversation for long time but I don't agree if he didn't want to hang out with me when I was poor he doesn't get to change his mind because I have money.", "created_utc": 1682936543, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134ijtj/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_on_a_family/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you let him back in that way he'll just continue to take advantage of you.", "NTA. He hasn't wanted to be a part of your life for ages, but now he can get a holiday out of you, he's suddenly desperate to be around you again? Nah. He just wants a holiday for free.", "NTA. \n\n>I messaged him about it saying I missed him and how I hate that we didn't talk and how I enjoyed his company and wanted a relationship. I understood that it wouldn't be like before but just asked if he could make time for me occasionally. He went off at me saying how he does have other people he wants to spend time with.\n\nEverything you need to consider is here. If you hadn't been paying for this holiday, would he have wanted to be in contact with you?", "NTA. He wants to go on the trip. He doesn't want to spend time with you. You don't owe him or his partner the trip. It's your money. \n\nHowever, be prepared for people to think you are being petty, and your relationship with A and L will get worse. If you don't care about those consequences, then enjoy the trip without A and L.\n\nI'm not being sarcastic. I have a sibling that no one in the family can take for more than 5 minutes. I have done the same thing you are planning, but I didn't second guess it. Some family members made comments, but when I asked them if she would have ruined the trip, they all agree that she would. So I asked them to zip it, and they did. I have no regrets. You are in a different situation, so will you regret it?", "NTA. \n\nIt seems like they only care about you because you have money now. But since this is a trip for the whole family, maybe you could allow them to come along if they pay for it. This way they aren't excluded. Don't let them take advantage of you or guilt trip you.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe he wouldn\u2019t have thought of this scenario specifically, but he should have thought of the possibility of no longer being included when he decided that his friends were more worthy of his time than his sister. He made that decision. Not you. Enjoy your holiday with people who actually want to spend time with you.", "NTA. This is a big reason I really wouldn't want to win life changing money. Everyone who disappeared and didn't ever talk to you again all of a sudden want to be in your life just long enough to go on a nice trip. Something tells me they wouldn't stop there either, and would no doubt want more out of you even though if you didn't win the money they wouldn't be talking to you right now.", "NTA because it\u2019s your money and it does sound like the brother only wants to be friends now that you\u2019re wealthy, which sucks. That being said, I\u2019d probably invite him anyways, if it were me, because this is the sort of situation that can make or break a relationship for good. If you\u2019re certain you don\u2019t want him in your life, then it doesn\u2019t matter.", "Nta op. Don\u2019t feel bad. He made his bed. Funny how he only remembers you when he wants a free vacation.", "NTA offer him the option to join, but he has to pay for himself and his partner. It's your money and you can decide how to spend it. I fully understand that you only want to pay for people who spend time with you without getting an expensive holiday as reward.", "Nah he chose to distance himself & blew up at you when you reached out. But Now he wants a vacation on your dime\u2026NTA", "NTA! It\u2019s hilarious how family won\u2019t get involved until someone puts their foot down in a situation. Now, all this sudden YOU have to be the peace keeper because your brother wants a free vacation. \nSorry, but I feel like, if you weren\u2019t an active part in my life before money, you don\u2019t get to be after. I get parents want all their kids together, but that\u2019s not on you. If your brother wasn\u2019t selfish in the first place, it wouldn\u2019t be like this. He doesn\u2019t get to treat you like crap and expect to reap your rewards because you share the same parents. \nPeople can say what they want, but it\u2019s not on you to extend the olive branch in this situation. It\u2019s literally only rewarding bad behavior. \nI mean, IF you do go ahead and invite him and his family, where will the entitlement end? If it were me, I would want to know this relationship could be fixed before I did anything for my brother. (If that\u2019s what you want) You need to know if you\u2019re going to be used. Family or not, no one is entitled to your generosity. \nUnfortunately, you\u2019re going to see true intentions of people around in what they tell you to do with your money. Hugs to you OOP, and congratulations on your winnings.", "It's your money and your life.

What gets me here is that A doesn't even have the balls to talk to you himself and is using your other brother as a proxy.  Cowardly and manipulative move on his part.", "I'll probably get downvoted here, but I'll say ESH. You're not inviting E, or your mother, or A's kids, you're inviting the family. \n\nYour parents are right about the part that this is a family experience that everybody will share and by not inviting A, you're depriving everybody else of his company. It's not you that you're denying him the chance to hang out with, it's the entire family. \n\nAnd his kids are coming but you're not allowing him to come? That's really cold.\n\nIf it was just a couple of people and you, then no, he has no right to come. But this isn't that.", "NTA - your money - your choice, its fairly obvious he wouldn't wanna join had you not paid for everything.\n\nI'd let them come, be the bigger person and make my parents happy, but he'd be getting the shittiest room :)", "I would invite A just to avoid future drama and to have a clear conscience.  Even if it\u2019s a healthy and reasonable boundary, I beat myself up if the application feels spiteful\u2026 if you are the same way, it\u2019s not worth the harm to your mental health.  \n\nIf you hold the line though, that\u2019s reasonable.  And I note that A himself hasn\u2019t approached you, he knows it\u2019s a bad ask.", "NTA\n\nI'd think you were being the arsehole, IF, you had not reached out previously....\n\nYou did, he rebuffed you.... Tough luck for him.\n\n\nHowever (and I think this is where we differ), In the interests of making it a complete family holiday, I would consider taking him. Contrary to what I say above... And I'm still a little conflicted. I think you make a great point about it being something you all talk about for years \n\n\nSo... You are not the arsehole. But this really is a once in a lifetime event. So, I'd make him sweat, but still consider an invite.", "NTA.\n\nHave fun having no money in 5 years.", "NTA. He let the relationship lapse for his girlfriend. And now he wants to join on an all expense paid holiday without putting in the effort of maintaining the sibling relationship? He can go suck on a lollipop.", "Man you are taking 40 people on a trip you're paying for and it's still not enough. People are never happy. NTA. Don't invite him and his partner he seemingly ditched talking to you over. The trip is to celebrate people in your life. He's not in your life.\n\nTell Dad & E it's your trip and if they don't like it, you can give their spots to someone who will be grateful instead of trifling.", "I like this response.", "Are you kidding me? Getting to run people noses in the puddle of urine they created by pissing on you for years?\n\nI'd hope I win just so I have the ability to blow it spitefully in front of those people.", "It doesnt sound like they have a relationship now", "But A was not interested in maintaining a relationship until there was something 'good' he might miss out on. I would not want someone like that on a trip I was paying for, family or not.", "Yeah, I get it. It's just that sometimes you've got to go with making a comment you believe in even you know is going to get those horrible, horrible downvotes.\n\n\"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.\" That's basically the idea I'm going with.
