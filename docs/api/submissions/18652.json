We had a family dinner, with my grandma, aunts, uncles, cousins etc, for a total of 22 people. \n\nMy mom (F55), my cousin (F28) and I (F29) did all the cooking. We served chancho con yuca, a traditional dish made of pork. We texted everybody a few days ago telling them what we were planning to serve and asking them if anybody had any reason why they can't/won't eat pork please let us know so we can offer an alternative meal. Everybody confirmed they were fine with chancho con Yuca with the only exception of one of my nephews (M6) and my youngest cousin (F9). Since the only two people that needed an alternative dish were two kids under 10 we decided the easiest thing to do was give them chicken nuggest and fries.\n\nSo, yesterday, I spent the entire day cooking with my mom and cousin A (F28). And when we were serving the dinner my cousin B's (F23, not the same cousin that helped cook) BF (M28) noticed that the two kids were serve chicken nuggets. He asked if he could get chicken nuggets. I politely explained to him we have just fried enough for the two kids since everybody else (him included) had confirm they were fine with eating chancho con yuca. \n\nHe said he only confirmed because we said we can accomodate an alternative dish so he thought it was going to be some vegan dish or gluten free or something. He said we should've told him the alternative dish was chicken nuggets.\n\nI explained to him when we texted we hadn't decided the alternarive dish yet. He then said itnwas our fault then for not letting him know when we decided it was going to be chicken nuggets so now he deserves some chicken nuggets.\n\nI was really tired after cooking for 22 people so I snapped at him, I went to the fridge, gave him the frozen bags of nuggets and the frozen bags of fries and told him he could fry his own nuggets. Now my cousin is mad at me because she said I was rude to her BF that he wass a guest and I made him feel as if he was unwelcomed in our celebration.\n\nMy mom says she absolutely understands why I snapped but that I should've controlled my temper just to avoid the drama.
