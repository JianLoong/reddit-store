We had a family dinner, with my grandma, aunts, uncles, cousins etc, for a total of 22 people. \n\nMy mom (F55), my cousin (F28) and I (F29) did all the cooking. We served chancho con yuca, a traditional dish made of pork. We texted everybody a few days ago telling them what we were planning to serve and asking them if anybody had any reason why they can't/won't eat pork please let us know so we can offer an alternative meal. Everybody confirmed they were fine with chancho con Yuca with the only exception of one of my nephews (M6) and my youngest cousin (F9). Since the only two people that needed an alternative dish were two kids under 10 we decided the easiest thing to do was give them chicken nuggest and fries.\n\nSo, yesterday, I spent the entire day cooking with my mom and cousin A (F28). And when we were serving the dinner my cousin B's (F23, not the same cousin that helped cook) BF (M28) noticed that the two kids were serve chicken nuggets. He asked if he could get chicken nuggets. I politely explained to him we have just fried enough for the two kids since everybody else (him included) had confirm they were fine with eating chancho con yuca. \n\nHe said he only confirmed because we said we can accomodate an alternative dish so he thought it was going to be some vegan dish or gluten free or something. He said we should've told him the alternative dish was chicken nuggets.\n\nI explained to him when we texted we hadn't decided the alternarive dish yet. He then said itnwas our fault then for not letting him know when we decided it was going to be chicken nuggets so now he deserves some chicken nuggets.\n\nI was really tired after cooking for 22 people so I snapped at him, I went to the fridge, gave him the frozen bags of nuggets and the frozen bags of fries and told him he could fry his own nuggets. Now my cousin is mad at me because she said I was rude to her BF that he wass a guest and I made him feel as if he was unwelcomed in our celebration.\n\nMy mom says she absolutely understands why I snapped but that I should've controlled my temper just to avoid the drama. My sister is 100% on my side.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1685560398, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wv4nl/aita_for_telling_my_cousins_bf_he_can_fry_his_own/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is 28, if he doesn't like what is being served he can go through a drive-thru on the way home and just say he isn't super hungry during dinner if someone asks. Or take care of his own food. But to demand someone go back and make him something else is a no-no, no matter if OP was only cooking for 2 or 22 people.", "NTA...Walking up to someone and demanding they cook you the kiddie meal is beyond rude. Your cousin should be embarrassed.", "NTA. He's lucky you didn't shove the nuggets up his ass to defrost.", "NTA. \n1- It was mother's day not bf day. \n2- You are invited you eat what you are given and say thank you.

He treats your house like a restaurant. \"I didn't know that the alternative dish would be something I liked\" What the hell. Also what 28 year old wants frozen chicken nuggets over home cooked pork?", "NTA - You would think at the very least he could have asked what the alternative options were before agreeing. Dude is entitled for real.", "NTA\n\n1) Cousin's BF is a useless tool.  He did not reject the chancel con yuca so he obviously was willing to try it.\n2) Dude who is a guest tries to blame you for not reaching out to him and explain the alternatives!!\n3) Is willing to make himself a fool by confronting you that he was not allowed to eat like the children.\n4) The cousin with the BF obviously did not spend time cooking, helping planning or probably even listing to the utter nonsense coming out of BF mouth.", "NTA\n\nHe was unbelievably rude and deserved exactly what he got.\n\nI don't want to shout but I really need to stress how much YOU ARE NOT THE AH!", "I\u2019m picturing a 28 year old man at a family meal saying \u201dtherefore I deserve some chicken nuggets.\u201d  This post made my day.

What the heck", "NTA\nYou were tired and he was being an AH, he got what he deserved", "NTA, you told him to speak up. He didn't, he could have enquired. He's 25.

Oh, and then saying that he \"deserves\" something as a guest should sum up all that you need to know about him.", "NTA. Your cousin's boyfriend was acting like a child. You spend all day cooking, he knew what the dish is going to be, and he has the audacity to ask to eat chicken nuggets with the children, not because he can't eat the main dish, but he prefers the chicken nuggets? Then, after you tell him there aren't enough, he insists? He was terribly rude and I think you handled it great. Tell your cousin because of his behaviour, he was and is unwelcome to any celebrations hosted by you.", "NTA, he is not a small child.
