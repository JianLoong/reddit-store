Also, have you asked what she finds so bad about who you are as a person that she's not willing to risk your younger siblings being exposed to it in a movie lest they become like you?

Its a shitty thing in a sense, which is why I dont watch new disney cgi. And of course in most Disney movies now, they have a hint of LGBTQ in their movies/shows. My mom used to tell me a lot too. \"Im not homophobic, but I only hate how there are some supporters or actual gay people out there who will try shoving their beliefs down your throats and be angry when you dont nesscarily believe their views.\"\n\nI can understand that. But obviously its effecting your mom to where shes way to homophobic and its effecting you", "You\u2019re NTA, there\u2019s just a whole lot of older people having to face the realisation that they actually are homophobic and racist, it might just not be in an overt way because it was more okay ten, twenty years ago, and they can\u2019t handle it. \n\nMy mum is exactly the same, swears up and down she\u2019s not homophobic or racist and yet she always flies off the handle about the smallest things, usually whatever YouTube is telling her type to be mad about ie. casting choices for Disney movies or the fact there\u2019s a gay reference in a tv show. She also starts trying to point finger and call me out to be \u2018too woke\u2019 if I ask questions. \n\nThe most recent one was the printing of NZs famous Edmonds cookbook that was going to be in Te Reo, she was working herself into a tizzy until I pointed out that they\u2019re not going to stop printing the English version nor burn the existing ones, they\u2019re just adding another option that isn\u2019t for you, it\u2019s not a big deal. Got the cold shoulder for a while for that.", "[removed]", "Ehhh. Question - does everything need to be black or white nowadays? Do we have to swing pendoleum from right to left. Where is the place for shades of grey ? Where is the place for center?\n\nLet me elaborate why I ask about that. I somehow understand your mother. I am not a homophobic - I have gay friends, I actually believe that people are allowed to love whoever they want. I am pro gay marriages. I strongly believe that it is not my place to check or judge what other people do in their bedrooms as long as those are adults and are there volonteerly. \nI love shows with gay characters in therm - like Grace and Frankie where husbands are gay. Their kissing on screen does not bother me at all. When conservatives attack gays I try to be an ally.\n\nThat being said quite frankly I am sick of so called \"representation\". Everything I watch today has a whole spectrum of minorities represented and it a really is annoying. \n\nDoes not matter what you want to watch - drama, comedy, Sci Fi, history, period pieces, cartoons ... Even children movies - all absolutely have to have some or all minorities represented. It takes away the experience for me, it distracts me from how great the movie or series is.\n\nAgain I do not have issue with gay characters - it did not bother me at all in Grace and Franky, it did not bother me in The 90s show. I do not have issues with other minorities - I love movies like Green Book, Help, Hidden Figures. But do I really have to watch gay characters in Witcher or do we really have to make Buzz Lighting gay ? Do we really need to black wash Cleopatra ? \n\nYou are wrong OP - it may not be important to the plot but it may take away from experience when it is forced. \n\nYou may also think that helps to build perception and get more allies but in my case and from what I see also around me is that lots of allies get angrier and angrier about that. \n\nCannot we somehow center this in right place rather than going from extremes ?", "YTA. You are obviously looking for reasons to victimize yourself and start fights, and that leads me to believe your perspective of the story doesn't account for her point of view. It seems like she is trying to put up with this and work through it with you while you are purposely making the situation worse for her, and it's ridiculous that you turn a phone call that you weren't even part of into a fight in which you felt such a strong need to be right you went on Reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand also I'm almost certain that the only reason there arent tons of \"YTA\" comments is because they will be strongly downvoted due to this being a sensitive topic", "NTA. Your mom sucks. Is she also bitter her own romantic relationships haven\u2019t worked out?\n\nI find that people really hung up on this stuff can often turn their inner anger, shame, and disappointment outwards.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m gay. There\u2019s nothing inherently inappropriate about being gay that children shouldn\u2019t see. Your mom\u2019s particular kind of homophobia is the kind that makes me want to cry. Really cry. For me personally I\u2019d rather they just wish me dead, or want to hurt me. Being told you are dirty and wrong and children shouldn\u2019t know about you is so much worse.\n\nEdit to add: This all sounds like multiple strong reasons to go no contact. I went no contact with my homophobic mom and have no regrets about it whatsoever, just sadness that she could never come to terms with reality before she died.", "NTA. Sorry tho.", "NTA. Ive had similar conversations with my own mother. Comments like im not homophobic cause im a republican I just care more about my money.... joke is she makes so little she would never come close to benefiting from anything a republican does. She doesnt think shes homophobic but she is lol. I dont talk to her anymore :)", "I fucking HATE this mentality. 'I don't use slurs or attack them so I'm not homophobic/transphobic/racist'. They understand so little, and refuse to understand more, about the queer community that they think only overt hatred is the bad part.  \n\nNo. No that's not how it works. Thinking children can't HEAR about a queer relationship while also not caring if there is a straight couple on screen? Literally homophobic. It shows that the only way you view queer relationships is through the sexual act and not as two people who love or care about each other. Being gay is so much more than how I have sex or who I have it with. It colors every social interaction I have with every person I meet. It influences my social circles, my spiritual worldview, my political leanings, and even media I consume. It's a fundamental part of who I am, it's not just how I fuck.  \n\nAnd being straight is the SAME. Its more than sex! They are just on such fucking auto pilot that they don't recognize it, because the systems and social structures are entirely catered and built around straight people.  \n\nGAAH I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but it's the most fucking intellectually lazy shit to claim 'Im not a bigot' when people who you are being bigoted toward are telling you how you're being bigoted. How about: It's ok to fuck up and get it wrong! Who hasn't? The trick is stopping. Listening. Learning. Changing. Growing. Being wrong/bigoted is only a character flaw when you insist on being wrong/bigoted in the face of education from those you're hurting.  \n\nFuck me I ate too many peanut M&Ms.  \n\nEdit: Forgot to add NTA.", "Wanted to wait a bit before replying but I won't be taking any bait from here on.

I'm sorry you had to deal with it too.", "I actually asked \"So if I come home with a girlfriend, you'd have an issue?\" And she said that I just simply wouldn't bring a girlfriend home because my siblings (7 and 10) were too young to be seeing that when the 10 year old knows abt drag and has gay friends herself and the 7 year old couldn't care less. I asked \"So you'd rather I hide who I am rather than me be comfortable enough to show the person I love regardless of gender\" and I got hit with the \"Not in my house.\" Idk if that's the same thing as you're asking me but it happened.", "I'm sorry your mom sounds a bit close-sighted in terms of gay ppl, actually just kinda rude abt them.

Why would it make them upset? \n\nObviously it's valid to be upset over bad representation, and believe me I'm not saying that all rep is good rep, but what good rep minorities do get, it's wonderful that they're finally being represented! And the representation I talk about here isn't that big of an issue, and in fact it's treated quite normally in the film. They don't dwell on it or question about it. It was quick and minor and some people didn't notice it. The problem is my mom did dwell on it, in fact expressed disgust because there's representation even in the smallest ways. \n\nI was bothered with her for more than one reason, aside from the homophobic behavior, which was the double standard that she had an issue with a background character having a girlfriend but not having one when my younger siblings watch graphic horror movies or TV-MA rated content, or much worse blatantly invalidated my own identity.", "If you have to say \u201cI\u2019m not a homophobe, but\u2026\u201d or pull in \u201cI have gay friends, but\u2026\u201d\n\nYou are a homophobe.", "Yk what's funny, she said the same thing.

I don't want to \"purposefully\" make it worse for her, I've actually been pretty adamant on staying out of her way, from staying in my room to keeping quiet. \n\nIt was originally just me saying \"hey what's so bad with a lil rep\" that it went from \"my kids can't be exposed to that\" as if it were propaganda when in reality it was a small scene in a movie that was shrugged off as a passing thought.

I kept giving my mom chances to hurt me, and it made me bitter for a long time. Just keep in mind that sexuality being allowed to exist isn't a matter of opinion. It's right and wrong. Your mother is wrong. \n\nThat doesn't mean you shouldn't love her, obviously. Being wrong doesn't make her a straight-up villain or anything, and she can always learn to be better.

So if my 7yo can know she has crushes on boys, why can't your 7yo siblings (who likely is already well aware) know that it's possible for girls to have crushes on girls and boys to have crushes on boys?

So I stopped arguing,  I valued my relationship with them too much and loved them despite their flaws. They've done too much for me. You'll have to decide what you value more if you can't stand her views, then stop arguing for now, and once you can have minimal contact,  but if you want a good relationship, stop arguing.

Especially if these situations are adding new conflicts in an already conflict-filled world.\n\nI'm sure the same thing happened when women fought for equal rights and when blacks fought for equal rights. They don't know how to handle themselves. There is a difference between \"pushing a woke narrative for the $$$$$\" and \" giving a representation in a work to be inclusive of all people\" though.
