I don't know if I even have enough karma points for this. I (18F) am bisexual, have been for years now. My mom (40F) was on a call with someone and I overheard her go \"I have nothing against homosexuals, I just don't know why they put it in a kid's movie.\" I, curious, ask her what she was on abt and she goes \"The Elemental movie mentioned that the water guy's sister has a girlfriend and it's like if Disney is trying to implant that into kid's brains. I don't want your siblings seeing that.\" My mom's always been weird abt rep in media how \u201cEverything is gay now\u201d\n\nPlease note: I am aware it was not my conversation to begin with. And that I shouldn't have stuck my nose in. She continuously pointed it out and I'm well aware. \n\nI told her back and forth about minor representation, how it wasn't important to the movie's plot and it shouldn't bother her because it didn't bother any of my younger siblings. I called her homophobic and that she sounded like an asshole. She continued talking about exposure and how the kids shouldn't be seeing that (bit ironic because my siblings watch all kinds of violence with her.) She called me ignorant for not respecting her opinion and sent me to my room. She's not seeing me after I move out. \n\nAfter about an hour, she came back saying she wasn't homophobic and I shouldn't have taken it personally. I came out to her again (despite having been outted in the 8th grade by her coworker.) She tried to invalidate me the same way she did back then, asking if I had ever done it with a man or a woman to know so. I told her she wasn't respecting my opinion (and my identity) and she said \u201cDo you hear yourself right now? You're so negative and hateful. Imagine how it'd be if I was really homophobic.\u201d I didn't leave my room after that, not even to eat. She called \u201cHey homophobe\u201d to call me out for lunch. \n\nToday, we were meant to go to a concert that I refused to go to because I'd be uncomfortable. She said \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d And I said \u201cNo. I'm not. Dunno why I have to result to avoidance whenever I'm not okay with things you do to get you to understand that things bother me.\u201d \n\nShe came into my room, confronted me and basically said I need to grow up and that I'm taking it out of proportion. That she's not homophobic because she's not out killing gay people. That it's her opinion. I clapped back with how she is, stupidly so, over an animated water lady with a girlfriend. Eventually after much arguing (which I won't go into much detail because of character limit), she left my room with how I wouldn't be seeing her ever again in two years and that I was ungrateful.

How could you be greatful if you have nothing to be greatful for? Your mom's only consept of hate is sex and violence. Shes twisted out of shape over mentioning a girlfriend off hand in the background of a movie - yet since the dawn of cinima every single movie (that was not one that was considered \"fringe\") painted women into tiny little boxes where they can only be validated by being obedient and have to be in a relationship with a boy (like a sidekick). Seriously every teen movie your mom grew up with split girls into 3 categories: good girl that gets the boy, wh0-re, and the ugly one. And shes upset at kids not being reinforced with those values? ... I hope the next couple years go by fast for you.
