She didn't know how to use any of the most basic programs we used so I, an admin assistant at the time, had to do it for her. She thought she was universally liked and an amazing boss. We didn't want more pizza Fridays or themed days, we just wanted her to do her job.\n\nThe amount of work and stress you take on when working under someone like that is immeasurable.
