You crashed a party. Like, it\u2019s shitty that you were excluded, yes. But just inviting yourself isn\u2019t acceptable.", "YTA and the fact that you thought the solution here was to just show up anyway tells me that maybe there\u2019s a valid reason why your coworkers don\u2019t include you in things. This is extremely socially tone-deaf behavior and I would not be surprised if you are behaving in ways that make people uncomfortable at work.", "YTA\n\nIf you genuinely believe the only reason you weren't invited was due to your race, inviting yourself and making a scene is not how to handle it.", "YTA\n\nYou admitted you\u2019re not close coworkers. So why would you be invited. You\u2019re not obligated to be invited anywhere.", "YTA. \n\nNo invite - You're not welcome and if you go don't expect the host to be fine with it.", "YTA\n\nIf you are not invited, you do not go.\n\nManners 101", "YTA. Go watch the episode of the Office titled Email Surveillance. Just to make it clear, you\u2019re Michael Scott and your coworker is Jim. Stop the episode right when Michael starts singing karaoke. That\u2019s how everyone felt about you being there. \n\nSeems like they probably didn\u2019t invite you cause they don\u2019t like to hang around with people that invite themselves wherever they want.", "YTA\n\nYou crashed a party, without any communication.  \n\n\nYou should've talked to the host before hand if you really wanted to go.", "YTA...you obviously knew you weren't wanted,  so obviously went for the conflict. That said,  I find it odd that everyone else would go to a party with the caveat that they not even tell you. This seems very schoolyard in maturity level.", "While being left out sucks, you\u2019re not entitled to go to someone\u2019s house when you knew they didn\u2019t want you there. You also are not entitled to an explanation. Whether it\u2019s racism or something else entirely\u2026 you have no control over what others do. When people show you who they are believe them, you don\u2019t need to spend time convincing other people of your worth.

You sound exactly like someone I know at work. If you aren\u2019t invited don\u2019t go. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you.", ">He also told me he was expressly told to not tell me as I'd...\n\nShow up and make a scene?", "YTA.  The fact that you can write a story blaming racism after trespassing at someone's house is more telling than not.", "YTA You ever thing the reason your colleagues don\u2019t want you around is BECAUSE you\u2019re the type of person who cries racism, crashes parties & starts fights?", "YTA\n\nIt could be a E S H if we knew the reason. But you are definitely one. You weren't invited and you know you weren't welcome. It's not your decision.", "Yep. You know YTA.", "YTA. Going somewhere you were specifically not invited to isnt cool. Refusing to leave moves you to an actual crime. The colleague that didnt invite may or maynot be an AH too, but that doesnt exonerate you", "Yta 100%", "YTA. You weren't invited. Why would you want to attend a party you weren't invited to? Whether the host is an ass or not is irrelevant. You weren't invited, and it was at a private home.", "YTA for sure, you don't go to a party you are not invited to unless it's specifically to make a scene.\n\nYour coworker that made the party might be asshole depending on their reason. Not everything that happen to you is because you are black. We all have people we are not friend or particularly close to at work. Until you have solid reason to indicate that they are racist toward you or that they are not excluding you from work related stuff, they are not the asshole.\n\nYour other coworkers might also be the asshole. I would be weirded out if someone invited me to a party and told me to specifically not say anything to someone. Unless I also don't like that other person, I would ask questions for sure.", "If you aren't invited to something and choose to go anyway, YTA. You could have always asked about why you weren't invited in the first place after the party had taken place and gone from there, but you've slammed that door shut entirely.", "YTA.   Maybe he just doesn't like you", "YTA - But let's say it was really a racial issue.... WTH would you want to go to a person's home you know is racist and doesn't like you? Just why? Then you start a fight knowing full well who the police would look at IMMEDIATEWLY. Come on, son! You know dam well YTA here.", "Why did he say he didn't invite you?", "YTA-You weren\u2019t invited. You had no business being there.", "ESH. Dude, you weren't invited, so insisting on coming was rude. That being said, the party host specifically excluding you is really mean.", "YTA \n\nEtiquette dictates that you don\u2019t show up to a party/gathering without an invitation. It\u2019s just bad manners. \n\nAnd you made it worse by crashing in. And be careful about the race allegation. Do not throw that loosely when you don\u2019t have all the facts. You\u2019ll lose credibility.", "YTA, they didn\u2019t want you there, someone told you about it, you cried the race card to make yourself seem like a victim, and then trespassed on a property you explicitly knew you shouldn\u2019t be at. \n\nWork is gonna be great fun for you.", "YTA- why not ask if you did anything wrong. or is there any conflicts he has with you and if anyway you can resolve or better the relationship. \n\nThis stunt may jeopardize your job as the team might not want any drama or anything that can cause issues at work.", "Yta you aren't close, you even admit that!  Stop trying to make it about race. You weren't invited bc *you aren't friends*.", "NTA\n\nThis will be controversial but if he invites everyone on the team but the one black person.
