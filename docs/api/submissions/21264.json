She\u2019s lived with us now for about 2 years, and my parents have never charged her rent or asked for anything in return, and I\u2019ve made it clear to them that I really appreciate them letting her stay with us. \n\nHowever, they just recently bought a house and it\u2019s a lot smaller than this one. It has one bedroom for my parents, one for me, and a third den-type room that they want to put my mom\u2019s work setup and my dad\u2019s gaming setup in. We\u2019ve told her that there isn\u2019t room for her anymore and she should look for a new place, (we gave her almost 2 months notice) but she was recently in 2 accidents back to back and is in massive debt so she can\u2019t afford her own housing. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to brainstorm with her and think of other families she can stay with, but she says she has no other options. She can\u2019t live with her parents because she\u2019s genuinely unsafe there for many reasons, so she\u2019s told me that her plan is to live in her car. \n\nMy other friends say I should try to convince my parents to let her stay in the den at the new place since she\u2019ll be homeless if I don\u2019t. If I talked to my parents I think I could convince them to let her live with us, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to decide what they do with their new house. My sister thinks that we\u2019ve let her stay with us for too long and that my parents should have some space to work in their new house. My friends think I\u2019m not fighting hard enough for her.

Like you said, at the end of the day, it is your parents home and they have the final say. I don't think it could hurt to try to convince them to let her stay. Try to compromise. Would your bedroom be large enough to share with your friend? One twin bed on each side of the room? College dorm style.", "NTA\n\nHer living situation is not your issue. And I get its your friend but she has been staying in your house for a few years and hasn't made any progress. IDK if she saved money but she isn't paying them so what is she doing with her money?

Also not your house - you parent's", "NTA\n\nShe is your friend, not your parents kid\n\nPerhaps you can let her stay in your room with you in a bunk, this way you give something up instead of your parents. You can get a second job, earn money and pay that to your parents to coiver your friend's living expenses.", "NTA\n\nI understand this really sucks for your friend.  Badly.  But your parents are the ones buying the smaller house.  It's not up to you.  And, since it is their house, they have the right to decide what will be done with the rooms.\n\nYou've done all you can.  She's a friend, not your responsibility if you have no flexibility here.\n\nHowever, I like the idea another poster had of putting her up in a bunk bed **in your bedroom**.  If you won't do that, don't ask your parents to sacrifice.", "NTA. I understand your saying she's had accidents that have set her back, etc., but she has also had two years rent free to save money, get a plan together, seek outside support from either government or other social services, etc. If her life isn't together, it isn't your fault even if you feel bad for the situation she is in.", "NAH I guess. I feel like you guys could have given more than a two months heads up, but your parents aren't wrong for moving, no one is wrong for not having space, and an accident is an accident. \n\nI don't know if you should convince your parents to let her stay in the den because she lived with y'all for two years and didn't pay rent or try to get her own place.

Two years is a long time to allow someone to live with you, and continuing it in a smaller place would be uncomfortable.   There are other options.  Check with homeless organizations and women's shelters in your area.   Since she has a little notice, there should be programs she can sign up for to help her.", "NTA- This is probably a good time for your parents to cut this girl loose so they are not stuck with her for the rest of their lives. Don't fight for her to move into the new place. There isn't room for her, end of story.", " NTA.\n\nIf any friend tries to urge you, tell boarder-friend THEY are offering to take her in.\n\nWord will get around FAST.", "I think we need ages. Is she like 18 or 28? Big difference here.", "NTA. Tell your friends that your parents have faithfully provided free room and board for your friend for two years to their financial detriment. Also, tell them that since they are so concerned about her they need to each take at turn at taking her in for two years for free and she will be set for several years. Let them know that if they are unable to do this then they need to stfu!", "Could you maybe allow her to sleep at yours (like a pull out cot) but she keeps her things in her car and has to be actively working towards finding new lodgings? \n\nIf you're trying to find a compromise. Nta either way.", "NAH", "Nta\n\nShe hasn't had to pay rent for 2 years, and she's 22, it's on her because she should have been saving money.", "Maybe they\u2019re not mutual friends\n\nYou gotta be able to save up a few bucks not paying rent for two years though? I think that seems like a reasonable expectation for an adult human", "Whoever the AH may be, it's not you or your parents, who just provided her two years free housing. That's a massive benefit - why was friend unable to sort herself out during that time?", "We are both 22, and she hasn\u2019t been given any timeline no. She was at risk of being homeless and we stepped in. \nShe isn\u2019t injured from the accidents but they set her back quite a bit financially. She makes minimum wage and because of the accidents she was dropped from her car insurance, and her parents dropped her from their health insurance a bit ago as well so I guess she just can\u2019t afford rent on top of that all.", "Right? How is she in massive debt if she has been living rent and expense free for two years?", "NTA, she's had 2 years to find a job that pays above minimum wage, unfortunately that's not sustainable even without rent honestly and she should realize that and work towards her future and not rely on free housing. \n\nIt would be above and beyond to let her stay with you a bit until she can sort things out, but you already gave her advanced notice so it's not necessary and YWNBTA if you didn't, but just consider it might lead to the end of your friendship.", "so these accidents were her fault?", "NTA - Two years was plenty of time for her to save up some money with minimal living expenses.\n\nI also wonder if this is your parents' polite way of kicking her out. I'm guessing they want their privacy and house back.", "NTA.  22 is young - but it\u2019s OLD ENOUGH to work; to pay rent; to understand the gravity of such a situation as having to live with a friend\u2019s family for multiple years.  Feels like that friend latched on for a free ride.  I\u2019m not saying it was malicious- it was however very short sighted.  Perhaps there should have been some prompting along the way from your parents like \u201chey, how are you doing, are you saving for your own place, etc\u201d stuff like that.  Either way - your friend should have realized the ride wouldn\u2019t last forever.", "NTA, she has had 2 years to save money toward her own place.  The next friend that tells you to talk to your parents tell them it is their parents turn to house her for the next two years.", "INFO: What is the reason she has for not saving up money during the two years of living rent-free? Is it due to a medical condition affecting her ability to work? Is it the pandemic disruption, which messed up a lot of onsite jobs? She didn't use that time to try and pay down debt. What did she use it for? Besides free housing?", "NTA, she had a golden opportunity to save a ton of money when she didn\u2019t have to pay rent for 24 months. Enough is enough, your parents were incredibly generous to her. She needs to act like a grown up now. Where she ends up is due to her own behavior.", "INFO: Do you want to invite her to stay? You\u2019ve mentioned other people\u2019s opinions on the situation but not much of your own. Is it a \u201cI don\u2019t want her to stay but I\u2019d feel bad if I said no\u201d or a \u201cI want to let her stay but I\u2019m not sure if I should\u201d type deal?\n\nOn a related note, what do your parents think of her?", "Let the friends take this person in.  Your parents have housed her for two yrs, rent free.\n\nI kind go think your parents downsized because they saw this as the solution to have the friend move.\n\nNTA", "NTA - it kind of sounds like they bought a new house with the intention of excluding this friend - hospitality has its limits, and 2 years of free room and board was plenty of time for this friend to get her shit together.  You didn't put any ages in - I assume she is not a minor - even if she was, your parents are not obliged to continue providing for her.  \n\nYour friend has apparently continue racking up debt, and has done nothing to get on to her own two feet for two years.  I would also question how accidental these 'accidents' were.   She needs to figure it out.", "NTA. Your friend is an adult, who should make adult decisions. Not your job to babysit and be their \"carry\" for the rest of their life.", "Yes - all these people with something to say about it, but not offering to put her up with them. Put up or shut up I say........", "Apparently she was in two accidents back to back and got in debt. Wether the accidents were her fault or not the family of OP should not have it suffer the consequences of this.", "22?  You are lucky there is a room for you in this new house........"]}
