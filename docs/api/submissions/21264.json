She\u2019s lived with us now for about 2 years, and my parents have never charged her rent or asked for anything in return, and I\u2019ve made it clear to them that I really appreciate them letting her stay with us. \n\nHowever, they just recently bought a house and it\u2019s a lot smaller than this one. It has one bedroom for my parents, one for me, and a third den-type room that they want to put my mom\u2019s work setup and my dad\u2019s gaming setup in. We\u2019ve told her that there isn\u2019t room for her anymore and she should look for a new place, (we gave her almost 2 months notice) but she was recently in 2 accidents back to back and is in massive debt so she can\u2019t afford her own housing. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to brainstorm with her and think of other families she can stay with, but she says she has no other options. She can\u2019t live with her parents because she\u2019s genuinely unsafe there for many reasons, so she\u2019s told me that her plan is to live in her car. \n\nMy other friends say I should try to convince my parents to let her stay in the den at the new place since she\u2019ll be homeless if I don\u2019t. If I talked to my parents I think I could convince them to let her live with us, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to decide what they do with their new house. My sister thinks that we\u2019ve let her stay with us for too long and that my parents should have some space to work in their new house. My friends think I\u2019m not fighting hard enough for her. Am I the asshole?\n\nINFO: Neither of the accidents were here fault. She has been relying on government assistance for her food as well as working full time; I\u2019m not fully aware of her financial situation but I just know she\u2019s in debt and had to use her savings to replace her car after the first accident. \n\nThanks everyone for your responses.

Two years is a long time to allow someone to live with you, and continuing it in a smaller place would be uncomfortable.   There are other options.  Check with homeless organizations and women's shelters in your area.   Since she has a little notice, there should be programs she can sign up for to help her.", "NTA- This is probably a good time for your parents to cut this girl loose so they are not stuck with her for the rest of their lives. Don't fight for her to move into the new place.

That's a massive benefit - why was friend unable to sort herself out during that time?", "We are both 22, and she hasn\u2019t been given any timeline no. She was at risk of being homeless and we stepped in. \nShe isn\u2019t injured from the accidents but they set her back quite a bit financially. She makes minimum wage and because of the accidents she was dropped from her car insurance, and her parents dropped her from their health insurance a bit ago as well so I guess she just can\u2019t afford rent on top of that all.", "Right? How is she in massive debt if she has been living rent and expense free for two years?", "NTA, she's had 2 years to find a job that pays above minimum wage, unfortunately that's not sustainable even without rent honestly and she should realize that and work towards her future and not rely on free housing. \n\nIt would be above and beyond to let her stay with you a bit until she can sort things out, but you already gave her advanced notice so it's not necessary and YWNBTA if you didn't, but just consider it might lead to the end of your friendship.", "so these accidents were her fault?", "NTA - Two years was plenty of time for her to save up some money with minimal living expenses.\n\nI also wonder if this is your parents' polite way of kicking her out. I'm guessing they want their privacy and house back.", "NTA.  22 is young - but it\u2019s OLD ENOUGH to work; to pay rent; to understand the gravity of such a situation as having to live with a friend\u2019s family for multiple years.  Feels like that friend latched on for a free ride.  I\u2019m not saying it was malicious- it was however very short sighted.  Perhaps there should have been some prompting along the way from your parents like \u201chey, how are you doing, are you saving for your own place, etc\u201d stuff like that.  Either way - your friend should have realized the ride wouldn\u2019t last forever.", "NTA, she has had 2 years to save money toward her own place.  The next friend that tells you to talk to your parents tell them it is their parents turn to house her for the next two years.", "INFO: What is the reason she has for not saving up money during the two years of living rent-free? Is it due to a medical condition affecting her ability to work? Is it the pandemic disruption, which messed up a lot of onsite jobs? She didn't use that time to try and pay down debt. What did she use it for? Besides free housing?", "NTA, she had a golden opportunity to save a ton of money when she didn\u2019t have to pay rent for 24 months. Enough is enough, your parents were incredibly generous to her. She needs to act like a grown up now. Where she ends up is due to her own behavior.", "INFO: Do you want to invite her to stay?

You didn't put any ages in - I assume she is not a minor - even if she was, your parents are not obliged to continue providing for her.  \n\nYour friend has apparently continue racking up debt, and has done nothing to get on to her own two feet for two years.  I would also question how accidental these 'accidents' were.   She needs to figure it out.", "NTA. Your friend is an adult, who should make adult decisions. Not your job to babysit and be their \"carry\" for the rest of their life.", "Yes - all these people with something to say about it, but not offering to put her up with them.

Those friends should step up or shut up. Simple. Your friend stayed with you and your parents rent free for 2 years. By the looks of it, she is grateful enough and didn't try and push you to convince your parents to give her the den. It's a difficult situation for her, to say the least, but it is what it is.

They have every right to use the new space as they please.", "NTA, but if you really want your friend to stay with you, why don't you make the sacrifice and share YOUR room with her?", "In two years she didn\u2019t do anything to make herself independent? Unfortunately circumstances changed and she has taken enough advantage of your family. I wouldn\u2019t feel bad you and your family have gone above and beyond and she still didn\u2019t feel motivated to do anything about it. She\u2019s gonna have to look at government assistance I\u2019m afraid.", "Looks like it", "She has a minimum wage job. \n\nShe has to pay her own health insurance (minimum wage is often just high enough to not qualify for Medicaid). \n\nShe has to pay for car insurance and gas to get to work. \n\nWe don\u2019t know if she has car payments, but can assume she does. \n\nWe don\u2019t know if she\u2019s doing any education that costs money. \n\nShe probably has a phone bill. \n\nWhen you\u2019re in poverty, it\u2019s hard to survive. \n\nMaybe she did have money saved up, but everyone was comfortable with the living situation and they were fine with her saving the money- that\u2019s great for her! But when you\u2019re poor, one unexpected bill can drain your accounts. Two? forget about being able to afford the basics. \n\nI\u2019m from rural Kentucky. I\u2019ve seen friends and family fight to get out of poverty but are never able to. I\u2019ve seen people who would be homeless if rent wasn\u2019t dirt cheap because they\u2019re renting houses that are barely staying up. \nI\u2019m on disability and don\u2019t have enough to survive on and am thankful for my parents keeping me from being homeless. \n\nJust because you have a job doesn\u2019t mean you have enough money to survive or pay more than the bare minimum.", "Hopping in to defend your friend\u2019s financial situation. \nHealth care costs are stupid high, assuming you\u2019re in the US. Minimum wage is likely to be just above the max for Medicaid. \nTwo accidents with costs associated can fully wipe out someone\u2019s money. \nShe started from scratch. If she\u2019s doing any kind of secondary education, money could also be going towards that. \nIt\u2019s not easy so survive when you\u2019re in poverty. It\u2019s nearly impossible to get out without support. \n\nAll that said, you\u2019re totally NTA and you are respecting your parents choice. \n\nIf you feel it\u2019s an acceptable thing to do, talk to your parents about doing a transition period. Maybe she can crash in your room for X amount of time while getting her money saved up again. \n\nYou and your parents have done a great thing! \n\nI just hate it when people don\u2019t understand how difficult it is to be in poverty. One unexpected cost wipes out savings. Two? forget being able to pay all your bills. \n\nLots of love and hugs to you and your friend as you figure this out!", "Why are you even answering this? I didn't ask you. Who are you to this person?      You don't even know half of the story.  So why even bother talking at all?", "NTA\n\nIm sorry but 2 years rent free would have been more than enough time to save alittle for this very instance.\n\nShes an adult & honestly you\u2019ve done more than enough already, imo.\n\nHer needs aren\u2019t your responsibility nor should you feel guilty for anything.\n\nShe & anyone else isn\u2019t your friend if they\u2019re laying it all on you.", "NTA If your parents are very nonconfrontational people, part of the reason for downsizing may be to have an excuse to kick your friend out. \n\nI've seen this happen by parents trying to encourage their early twenties kids to move out. Never seen it for a friend of a kid though.", "NTA. Two years is long enough. She needs to move on and so do you.", "If the accidents weren't her fault the others insurance would cover her loss in assets right? Or is this some American thing I'm too European to understand?", "NTA but if you are in the US she should check out Job Corps", "Right? Opie said they weren't her fault, but 2 accidents don't get you dropped from insurance. She had to have more going on and/or she was majorly at fault.", "A lot of the information I used came directly from her comments. I added them here. The only things I speculated on were phone and car payments and the possibility of more education. \n\nI used personal experience to explain how she could still have no money despite working for two years. \n\nI simply wanted to shed light on the fact that the friend may be trying her best but still have little to no funds. I was sharing my opinion based on personal experience and comments that OP herself wrote. \n\nI was adding to the discussion on this post. You didn\u2019t ask me. But people generally share opinions and viewpoints here. \n\nI may not know this person, but I know people in similar situations. And I hear them get shamed and judged. \n\nYou may say it\u2019s not my place to advocate for a stranger, but I\u2019m going to anyway.", "Why?  You aren't asking for advice. Op is.  You talking and answering questions that you don't know is utterly useless in helping out op.\n\nI can't give any advice to op with your half answers. That I didn't even ask you.  \n\nIf op doesn't want to answer. That's totally OK.  Then she doesn't need an opinion from me. And that's also OK."]}
