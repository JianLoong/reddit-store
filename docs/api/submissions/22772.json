I refuse to cook on my own dime for a group of 10 co workers bc I was never involved in the agreement and was blindsided by it  \n\n2. Other team members have cooked in the previous weeks.

Give an inch, they take a mile.\n\nRead through everything you've already personally sacrificed for the greater good for these people -- far more already than you should, and it's still not enough. For these people, it'll never be enough.\n\nSo, don't worry about it. Do your job, be proud of your contribution, and to hell with the extraneous BS. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd stop working so much unpaid overtime.", "NTA. This whole situation is bullshit & exploitive. You didn't agree to cook & just because you're salaried doesn't mean you have to spend your life there especially with a wife expecting. I'd definitely remind the team tonight that you weren't involved in that agreement and your saving money for the baby.", "NTA.  Since you have never participated in this lunch ritual in the past, you have not benefited the work and money of others.  Hence, you are not taking advantage of anyone by not participating when it is 'your turn'.  Just tell them you are the team temporarily, you really cannot afford the unexpected cost and that you will not participate in the weeks ahead while still part of the team.  This way no one is providing you with a free lunch.", "NTA. You didn't agree to these terms. And you even are taking time away from your personal time to help them. If they have a problem, you can stop helping and take the extra time to spend with your family doing something you'd much rather be doing. I guarantee you these people just like wasting money to flaunt how \"rich\" and \"influential\" they are.", "NTA. This sounds like it should be an opt-in thing and I can see with this kind of attitude about people that push back against them why they'd need someone to come in and get them back on track if they care more about their lunch rotation than their actual work. It would be one thing if you'd been there for a while, joined in their lunches and were made aware of it more than a day in advance but you haven't. You're not being an asshole or cheap", "NTA. You're a troubleshooter; as such, you're not exactly part of the team.", "NTA. As long as you haven't been eating the lunches every Friday (which from the comments it seems like you haven't), there's no obligation to participate. And the co-worker who went off on you and insinuated you were broke is HIGHLY unprofessional. The office doesn't have to be cold and unfriendly, but it has to be accepting of those who don't have money to blow on customs they never signed up for.", "INFO did you participate in eating the lunches the others cooked/brought?", "NTA", "NTA remind them they weren't adult enough to discuss and ask you and you don't partake in their general lunch anyway. They never cared and why is your income their concern? How mature of them.
