We have had a non existent relationship for most of our lives, attended different schools and generally did not speak to each other. Growing up in an immigrant household where gender norms are exploited ( I did all of the cooking and had to literally serve my brother meals), I\u2019ll admit I grew to resent him by the time I hit early teens. While he was encouraged to follow his dreams and spoiled by my parents our entire childhood, I was told that I\u2019d have an arrange marriage by the time I turned 20. Thankfully I got a full ride to a state university and attained a job abroad shortly after.By the time I graduated from university my father disowned me ( I turned down a marriage proposal that his ENTIRE family pushed for). My brother while not agreeing with me getting disowned basically told me that I should have said yes anyway. During my time abroad my brother and I would check in every few months. These check ins were no longer than 5-10 mins and consisted of him updating me about our parents and younger siblings ( they are a decade plus younger than us and I call them separately).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo years ago I went back home and planned to stay for a few months to take care of our mom (my father actually went on vacation ) and was shocked to see that my brother had moved back in with them (he told me he moved to a town near by). When I asked our mom why she needed me home when her adult son (who was not paying any bills and worked with our father) was at home, she said she couldn\u2019t trust him to take her to her appointments. My brother and I got into a huge argument about how he wasn\u2019t able to take care of our mom WHILE HE WAS LIVING AT THE HOUSE, and had me fly for two days. I ended up leaving after a month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCut to a month ago, my mother calls to tell me that my brother is engaged and that I would need to fly home to attend the wedding with her. She said that she would NEED me to attend because my fathers side has been invited as well and would like to have someone she trusts sit with her. I refused bc 1) while my brother told me about his engagement we are barley on speaking terms 2) my father would be in attendance and I have not spoken to him since he disowned me nine years ago. My mother called again last night in tears about how she cannot attend without me, I reiterated that I have no intention of going and the thought alone makes me itch with anxiety. Minutes after the phone call I get a voice note from my mother stating that she\u2019d miss her son\u2019s wedding if I don\u2019t show up. While my fathers family is terrible, I also genuinely dislike her son.

How can your attendance at the wedding help her?", "NTA You are not your mother's emotional support person. You don't like the groom, and his father disowned you. Your mother wasn't supportive either, and now wants you to set aside your own feelings to accommodate her. Your younger siblings and her side of the family can support her. I wouldn't go, and I'd limit contact with her as well.", "NTA, did your brother even invite you?

If your brother didn\u2019t invite you, that\u2019s tantamount to saying you are not welcome. So you really can\u2019t go even if you wanted.", "NTA\n\nsounds like a very toxic family", "NTA. Your family sounds super toxic, and you should check out r/raisedbynarcissists for support. Sending you hugs as I also come from a similar background.", "That is some top-tier guilting and manipulation on your mother's end. You're in an entirely different **country** and somehow you not coming home will keep her from attending? \n\nI could sorta understand if she lived in the other country with you,  was physically unable to travel without assistance, and you were the only option in the world period. And even then, it's shaky. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou're an adult and so are your parents.  You need to do what is best for you and they can make their own decisions about attending, regardless of your attendance.

It\u2019s a toxic situation all round and is best avoided.\n\nYour mother wants to go to your son\u2019s wedding. And, for whatever reason, no longer trusts (or never trusted) your father. It\u2019s easier for her to blame you than to blame your father, your brother, or the literally dozens of other people expected to be in attendance.\n\nNo winners in this situation.\n\n(And apart from the wedding, is your mother okay? Is she safe at home? Are there other ways she needs help? Perhaps focus on those instead.)", "ESH\n\nYour mother grew up, presumably, the same way you did: treated like 2nd class compared to men. She also had likely a lot less opportunity than you. She's clearly dependent on your relationship because she cannot trust her own son or husband. She needs someone to be there for her. \n\nI may not be seeing the full picture, but sounds like your mom really wanted to and still wants to maintain a relationship with you. \n\nYes your brother and father both suck and are AHs. Think of this as supporting your mother instead. You don't need to get your bro a gift or anything. \n\nIf it's cost prohibitive, that's one thing. She may even offer to fly you out if she really needs you there. \n\nI really feel for your mom. She still has to live with these people who treat her like dirt.

I would not trust what she says. I'm certain she believes she has your best interests in mind, but her idea of best interests may not be good for your well-being. \n\nThere is a high likelihood that something more is going on here. She has to know that you showing up, without notice, would set your father off and low-key ruin any celebration, so it's safe to assume he knows you're coming.", "They're all going as well. It's just in my culture the daughters either live with the parents or are married. The fact that I don't live at home AND missing what she deems is key family events is disgraceful and would make our family the topic of gossip."]}
