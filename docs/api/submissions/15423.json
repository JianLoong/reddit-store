A few months ago he moved his gf in with him. I thought she was cool and all was fine until we were in a match one afternoon. Some randos joined our team, they had mics, turned out to be two women playing. No problem on our end but his gf wasn't thrilled and didn't want him playing with any women. He wanted to respect her boundaries so he left the game and afterward, whenever we'd play games that we use mics and pick up randoms, we'd only play if we wound up with all guy teammates. The real problem popped up when we were playing a different game, queued up for a dungeon, and we wound up with three people in our party using women characters. She didn't like that either because my brother couldn't tell for sure if the players themselves were men or women.\n\nFor a little while I stuck it out and we wound up spending most of our time just trying to find other players that didn't step over his gf's boundaries. Honestly, I felt like we were being creepy asking players if they were a guy or gal before playing. On top of that, trying to find a party that would meet her approval if she saw him playing really cut into my limited time a lot of days. I went from playing with him two to three times a week in the afternoon to maybe once a week and it's not consistent. It's his relationship and I respect that so I didn't want to say anything and just started playing later at night for a little bit after my kids are in bed instead of in the afternoons.\n\nYesterday I went to a friend's house for their birthday and my brother and his gf were there. Things were fine until I was leaving and my brother asked if I wanted to play later this coming week, I said I'd see. He brought up how I barely play with him any more and I told him \"Nothing against you (his gf) but between work and kids I get limited time to play and I don't want to spend it looking for players that only use e-peen characters because she can't deal with pixel women being around your pixels, and I'm tired of sounding like a creep.\" I left, and got a text from him late last night that they've been fighting, and he gets why I said it because he gets frustrated too but I shouldn't have said anything and just dealt with it in silence as he does.

I think, ultimately, you did him a huge favor by bringing her insecurity out into the open.", "NTA. HE can to walk on eggshells if HE wants to, but you don't. Limited game time was probably the outcome girlfriend wanted, though. Red flag?", "NTA. Even if she was in the right (she wasn't) you were respectful in your statement & def weren't the ass.", "That's the really weird part! She doesn't have any issues with his female co-workers or the few female friends he has. Just something about pixel women and women gamers I guess?", "Hope there\u2019s some all male cast shows on netflix. Imagine if a woman appeared on the tv when he\u2019s watching something, the gf would lose her marbles", "Any recommendations how to address it with her lol", "She's controlling. This if he was doing this to her? It's no less abusive because she's a girl.", "Maybe your brother was being inappropriate with female gamers in the past and that's why she has only this really annoying and extreme boundary and why your brother is willing to put up with it and wants you to deal with it in silence? That's the only reason I can think other women are seemingly fine to her.", "Do not address it with her. Address it with your brother. He's already said that you should have \"dealt with it in silence\" which makes me wonder what other controlling things she does that he hes afraid to talk about. I'm not gonna say this is certainly an abusive relationship based on this one thing, but it's not a good sign.", "Is it an issue that expands beyond just games?  I had an ex who would get mad if I said thank you to the cashier the wrong way.  If it's a jealousy issue then it is her problem to resolve.  She is unlikely to realize on her own she needs to change.  Your brother should be the one to bring it up and I guarantee that will not go well.  \n  \nIn reality I would think this is relationship terminating.  If you're dedicated to doing something about it yourself you should just ask her why she is concerned about playing games with women online or in character.  Explain the issue, that it's impacting the time your brother and you spend together.  Remind her he is there to play with you, not the randos.  Offer a concession like muting the lobby when you get in.  \n  \nIf you bring it up be prepared for her to try and cut you out of your brother's life.", "You don\u2019t address it with her. You provide your brother with support so he can address it with her.", "All of this. Dealing with things in silence is how abusers and coercive controllers get away with stuff. It's not your job or place to address anything with her but make clear to your brother you're there if he needs support (i.e. in leaving the relationship....) and that you're always down to game - JUST with him. Her behaviour is not reasonable and people should not excuse it.", "No that's the weirdest thing about it all. She has no problem with his female co-workers and is friends with the few female friends my brother has. After the mic party incident, I asked him about how she was with his female friends and she's still fine with them- just something about girls online apparently.", "How old is she?  How long have they been dating in general?  It's a really weird hangup, maybe one that can be resolved just by talking to her.  The standard reddit thing would be to say run, but I understand that is often somewhat knee-jerk.  That being said, having been in a similar relationship, it starts more with not wanting \"new\" female friends introduced before doubling down and starting to make accusations of infidelity.  At a minimum he needs to be on the lookout for signs she's trying to tighten down.  Control issues like this come from insecurity.  \n  \nIf you talk to her, the above is the best advice I can give.  She needs to know that the game time is about you two, not the other people online.  I don't know what help there is with her being concerned about female characters.  You may be able to get her into some games a bit to maybe show her it's harmless.  It's your brother's relationship so obviously it will be his call, but just be aware and be there for him.  If she is doing other controlling things she will be actively trying to make him think other people are like this.  Remind him that most people aren't this crazy from time to time, because my situation became very isolating and felt hopeless.  I hope the same does not happen to him.", "Thin end of the wedge. This will escalate. She starts with girls her has no prior relationship with, get him used to obeying her demands. Then she doesn't want him doing overtime if its just other girls at work. Then she doesn't want him to see his female friends if she's not there.\n\nThis is control. Not boundaries, boundaries are aboutyour self not other people. She needs to go to therapy for her insecurities and not make them his problem.", "She's 27 and they've been together something like a year and a half. I will still be there for him, the only thing that's changed is my not gaming. Only reason I asked about speaking with her is that obviously, I'm still going to have to be around her and being prepared if she brings it up again.", "I think \u0131ts not about women but about you.

I would hate to be in your position dealing with that.\n\nThen, I imagine saying that to my husband \"no playing games with other chicks..... \" and I feel like some insecure, immature pyscho.\n\nYea, I hope your brother has a lot of fun with that somehow because most reasonable people would hate to be dealing with that", "Girlfriend is a huge control freak.

You are not the one in the relationship, you did stay silent for awhile and honestly he asked why and you answered him. \n\nFor me personally, I am in a relationship with a guy who loves to game, I knew this before we started dating and know he plays with both men and women.

There are more and more female gamers. Unless someone has 24 hours a day to game or they only play in private parties, it's almost impossible to find an online group with no female gamers or gamers using female avatars. \nMy husband and I game, usually not together. He likes FPS games (Battlefield, CoD) while I like sandbox RPGs (Skyrim, Fable). I've had female friends and acquaintances be genuinely surprised that I don't care that my husband games. I always answer that I knew this was a hobby of his before we got serious, I know where he is (in the living room), and if I or our daughter needs something, he responds. They then explain that, to them, it looks like he's ignoring me or not spending time with me. It sounds like this is the case with the gf. She won't buck up and say that she wants more attention so she's making it so frustrating for him to game without pissing her off that he'll stop on his own. \nI find it very, very disturbing that he actually said you should 'suffer in silence' like he does. That's not a healthy relationship dynamic AT ALL.", "It's actually kind of hilarious how insecure his gf is. At least from the outside looking in. It must be maddening for you.

He likes living with his GF for other reason. There is no upside to you in tolerating it and it makes you uncomfortable. He should respect your boundaries as much as he respects his GF's.", "NTA he needed to hear how fucked in this was.\n\nAlso I feel really bad for the women you encounter and bail on. It hurts to be treated that way even if you two have good intentions", "Nope, NTA.

She\u2019s controlling and it\u2019s a major red flag. \n\nSaw the comment about supposedly not having issues with co-workers and existing female friends. You don\u2019t know how long that will last. It may be easier to start with barring online female gamers and avatars then, shift to Boys Nights and Girls Nights exclusively; or, slowly losing touch/being too busy to hang out with the female friends until they stop trying to get together. Or, it could be she\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll meet someone new through gaming and dump her. Absolutely none of it is okay or anything your brother should put up with. I suggest you talk to him and show him this thread. But he needs to address the issues in the relationship and understand that she\u2019s not setting boundaries, she\u2019s manipulating and controlling him. \n\nAn example of her setting a healthy boundary would be if she didn\u2019t like the general content of a game he plays (maybe she doesn\u2019t like guns or gore), so she plans to go out with her own friends during that time to avoid being exposed to it. That\u2019s an appropriate boundary that solves her problem while not interfering with how her boyfriend lives his life.", "NTA \u2014 why should you have just dealt with it in silence?\n\nIf he chooses to tolerate his partners ridiculous insecurity and controlling behaviour, then that\u2019s on him. If it affects his other relationships, that\u2019s his choice.

In essence, her manipulative controlling both of you. \n\nYou\u2019re smart enough to back out, hopefully your brother opens his eyes a bit puts an end to this weird and petty dynamic one way or another. \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "This is absolutely nuts and wow, he's really in the deep end if he thinks \"you should suffer in silence like I do.\" I'm so sorry to hear this. Oh, and NTA.", "As a mmorpg player, maybe even your same mmorpg (you can find out from my post history if you care to): I'd resume playing with them and change my character into the sexiest female character model with the most outrageous skin baring equipment I could conceive of.", "My ex wife would act like this whenever my brother and I tried playing games or doing anything together. Her excuse was other women, whether pixelated or not. It wasn't actually about the women, just that I was trying to spend time with someone other than her. 100% not about the women. You sir, are NTA. Hopefully, your brother will wise up like I did and kick her to the curb", "Does she have an issue if they watch a movie and a women appears?", "She's either building up to keeping him away from all women, or she's just trying to stop him gaming at all.", "She probably does have issues with other women but can\u2019t control that so she\u2019s focusing on pixel women", "She doesn\u2019t like him playing games so much and is trying to control that is what\u2019s I\u2019d guess", "You can tell her that female players already have a hard time in finding players who accept the fact they're playing with girls. \n\nIt would be very cool to not have to deal with their partners too.", "He *was* \u201cdealing with it in silence\u201d.

It's just terrible. If we were out and I vaguely look at an [attractive] women's direction, I was \"checking them out\". If I was polite to [attractive] servicewomen, was because I was interested.\n\nShe had no problems with my female coworkers until a new [attractive] intern started working. Me mentoring the intern was me trying to get it on with her.\n\nThe last straw was when we were on my aunt's home for holiday, and a cousin came to visit my aunt with her 14 years old child.\n\nI'm very close with this cousin since I was a child, and have know all their children and am close to them as well. Then she accused me of being too friendly with the 14 years old. And that just did it to me.\n\nI had been conditioned to accept her jealousy bit by bit. Until she would check my phone. Read my emails. Distance myself from female friends. And like the frog in the water being boiled little by little I didn't noticed how fucked up it was.\n\nBut that did it. It was the shock that woke me and made me realize how absurd everything was.", "Sadly, I don't know how it is for OP, but if we are indeed playing the same game, we can't really customize our characters without paying real money, especially not our genders.\n\nBut yeah, I'd say playing around with glamours is half of my endgame now that I'm finished with most of current content... Besides, a lot of outfits are now gender-unlocked and you can do some things...", "Yes, you're right, I was totally shifting the blame because we know 100% of the facts obviously and that's why I added at the end there that's the only reason I could think of for why someone would bother putting up with behavior that dumb.

Or if she ruins this game would he quit gaming?", "Given him saying 3 other players, I'd say it's likely to be WoW over FFXIV (5 player groups vs 4 player groups)", "I pity your brother, I hope he realizes early enough that what he is sitting through for some certain benefit he sees in it is not worth it.", "She has serious security issues. \n\nHonestly, I think it was great that you didn't dance around the subject. \"I'm not playing with you, and this is why\"\n\nShe got between you and your brother with her unreasonable rules. She's forcing you and your brother to be sexist against your own moral compass. \"Sorry, I don't play with girls.\"\n\nI would feel horrible if I was the reason why my husband stopped spending time with a family member.", "I\u2019m pretty concerned why your bro\u2019s gf is so insecure she can\u2019t handle not only a female playing a video game in a group setting\u2026 on the internet\u2026 but also males playing as female avatars. That\u2019s just worrisome and pretty misogynistic on her part. I\u2019m a female, I own hundreds of video games and play a ton. Everything from FPS shooters like cod, old school doom, MMORPGs like EverQuest or RuneScape, farming like Stardew Valley- I could go on forever\u2026 my husband also plays a ton of games and we often co-op together. My husband in fact usually plays female characters because to him they seem lighter and less \u201cclunky\u201d due to usually having a smaller frame. Needless to say we don\u2019t go hunting down other gamers to play with for any reason other than finding a solid group to slay and pillage with. She sounds insufferable and it sounds like you have a diplomatic response and he pushed the issue with you, and in turn you were honest. Enough is/was enough. You deserve to enjoy the free time you have not wasting said time accommodating  someone else\u2019s partner\u2019s ridiculous sexism and insecurities.", "I'm old and don't understand the gaming environment *at all* (had to read the post twice to begin to get it - lol), but I do understand controlling individuals and your brother's gf is one of those. I predict your brother will be dealing with lots and lots and LOTS of stuff \"in silence\" if he stays with her. \n\nProps to you for speaking up. You did so directly, with justification, and with respect. Your little brother could take a lesson.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your brother\u2019s girlfriend sounds terrible and your brother sounds scared of her.", "NTA, and I love your response!   Factual, not angry, laid it on the line.  And youre right. \n\n(FWIW, I'm a woman, and her insecurity is a bit much)", "NTA at all. He shouldn't tolerate it in silence either", "NTA, your brothers girlfriend is insanely immature, and she is being really pathetic.", "NTA it's good that somebody had the fortitude to say it out loud. The gf is significantly affecting you by projecting her own insecurities.", "NTA. You could have expressed it a bit more diplomatically but I don\u2019t blame you for being frustrated with this absurd situation. Your brother may be \u201cfine\u201d silently dealing with this nonsense but you don\u2019t have to do the same.", "If you play third person games then I'm willling to bet that a lot of these female characters are being played by dudes who don't want to look at a dude's ass all the time", "NTA. Her insecurity and bizzarre attitude needed to be called out at least once.", "Your brother can take all the insecurity bullshit his girlfriend throws at him, but not on your time. Good for you for telling your brother the truth and stomping on the eggshells your brother tiptoes around.", "NTA. Your brother even agrees with you but he wants you to suck it up just because he has to? Nope.", "Your brother has a very tough road ahead of him. This is only the tip of a very large green-eyed iceberg. NTA.", "NTA His relationship sounds harsh. Be there for him when it ends badly.", "Is he also being controlled if he wants to play a game with a female protagonist (like Metroid)? She's being controlling, and it gives me shivers.\n\n(I like playing as female characters- the voice acting is usually better. I've been grinding for money and XP in River City Girls, which has been a real blast so far)", "NTA, and if your brother is already \"dealing with it in silence\" about this, it sounds like it's going to be a shite relationship. The GF sounds controlling and weird, like the type who won't want your brother to have female friends because they'll \"all be trying to hook up with him\". Hope your brother gets out of that relationship quickly", "NTA", "NTA.  \n\nWhy on earth should you suffer in silence when it\u2019s your time she\u2019s wasting. your enjoyment she\u2019s ruining, and your sibling relationship she\u2019s interfering in? What you said seems unexaggerated, civil, and most importantly, true. How your brohet chooses to deal with her is down to him.\n\nEdited: typo", "NTA - she sounds like a nightmare and to be honest hopefully you freed him of that shit one way or another", "NTA - She needed to hear how her behavior is perceived and that her insecurities are cutting into the quality time you spend gaming with your brother. Honestly, it sounds like you were calm and respectful when you said it.  Your brother needs to grow a spine and his gf sounds like the AH.", "NTA, I\u2019m exhausted just reading about her", "NTA This is NOT A BOUNDARY this is CONTROLLING BEHAVIOR.  Please ask your brother what he'd say if a woman he knew (sister, friend whatever) said \"My boyfriend isn't okay with me being on my coed sports team because there are other guys so I need to look into a new team to enjoy my hobby\"  what would he tell this woman about her boyfriend, and then ask why he somehow deserves worse treatment from his partner.", "NTA, and this sounds like textbook abuse of your brother to me.", "NTA someone needs to point out how ridiculous this is... however has your brother ever cheated online before? That maybe where the jealously is coming from", "NTA. I laughed way too hard at \u201ce-peen characters.\u201d", "NTA. Just a thought but is she jealous of women gamers?", "This has to be ffxiv right?", "NTA. Your brother\u2019s gf has some crazy insecurities. I can understand if she didn\u2019t want him chatting with women on the mic, just don\u2019t use it for the games where girls are playing. To be upset about female characters with no mic when there\u2019s literally no threat to the relationship is insane.", "*Brother, suffering in silence is not a mature way to deal with your girlfriend's insecurities.  But if that is the kind of relationship you want to be in, one where you girlfriend doesn't trust you and assumes that just because you have a penis that you are constantly looking to cheat on her...then by all means, don't do or say anything.  Just suffer in silence and watch as you lose all your friends and she isolates you from everyone in your life.  But understand, I am not the suffer in silence type.*\n\n*I have a problem with the way she mistreats you and I am not going to apologize for that.  My door is always open to you, but I'm not going to ignore the way she treats you.  Not now.  Not ever.*\n\nNTA", "Odd question, but is one of the games ffxiv?\n\nIf so, good luck finding people who play male characters.\n\nActually, if not, still good luck playing with people who play male characters.", "NTA.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to suffer in silence. She\u2019s not your girlfriend.", "Dude you need to talk some sense into your little bro. This girl is giving off a red flag so big it could be flown over Moscow. He needs to dump her ass.", "All 3 of you are. Her for her stance and boundary. Him for not addressing it with her and seeing what the root was so he could work on it with her. And you for calling him out in front of her an a bunch of other people. Everyone involved could deal with it all differently and end up in a better place.", "NTA. And if you ever wanna grind Gambit hit me up.", "If he wanted you to be silent about it, why did he ask you? He's the one with the crazy jealous gf. He needs to see the extent of the problem NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour brother needs to grow a spine.", "NTA. brothers gf is a wack job.", "NTA. My SO plays online with others and I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re male or female. They\u2019re just trying to play a game and these people are literally all over the USA and some in other countries. \n\nI hate online play because I enjoy playing a game at my pace and with having kids, I need to pause a lot, so for myself, it is easier if I don\u2019t play online. \n\nBut your brother\u2019s girlfriend is absolutely ridiculous for having those \u201crules\u201d for his online gaming. That is just insane. \n\nDoes she think your brother is gonna fall in love with a woman over (insert game/gaming system here)?", "NTA.", "Nta if she didnt want to get called on her sexist behavior then she shouldn't have behaved like that.  Why does she care if other players are women???", "NTA shes way too controlling and its not your proplem to deal with, your brother is old enough to know what shes doing isnt okay.", "It\u2019s insane to me that people put up with this. If one of my friends had a girlfriend that acted like this they would be laughed at/shamed right out the gate. Attempting to tolerate the behavior instead of squashing the insecurity and sexism at the beginning was the wrong move", "Right? Bro better not play FFVII Remake because Tifa's got pixelated bazongas. TBF, she's a kick-ass character and can really do some damage.", "It's because if she tries to control the group of friends that was around before her she will likely get a lot of pushback from said girls.", "Please tell me this isn't WoW \ud83d\ude2d", "Oh she 100% has a problem with those women too\n\nBut she can't isolate him from all the women in his life at the same time.  She has to start somewhere", "This may be an opportunity for you to put on your big brother shoes and give him a reality check. He can game with his girl and he can game with you; he does not need to do both at the same time. If the girlfriend is cool with that, then problem solved.\n\nIf the girlfriend has a problem with that, then make him understand that the issue is no longer games; it\u2019s that she does not want him to do anything fun by himself. That is a big \ud83d\udea9. It may take some time for him to come to terms with this since, despite knowing you\u2019re right, he\u2019s currently pushing back against his girlfriend and is looking for an outlet that doesn\u2019t live with him (you). Give him time. Point out that your wife has her own life and activities independent of you.", "Don\u2019t, address it with your brother and ask him when he started to become sexually attracted to a walking pile of red flags.", "No need for you to address it.   You can't argue with delusion and she's not your gf.", "Put lipstick on his work shirt. Jk jk don't do that. There's nothing you can do. This is your brother's relationship. He needs to figure out what is more important to him.", "I thought of the second option too: she just doesn't like his gaming and is making it impossible", "Then she needs to break up with him, there really isn't a scenario where being this controlling is okay even if you try to reframe it as a \"boundary\" (it isn't).", "Exactly. Brother is being a cowardly weasel.", "I never said it was okay. I was just providing a possible explanation for the brother's willingness to put up with something stupid. That seems to be what people are not understanding.", "You are right it's about control, but I wonder if it's about her making gaming as hard for him as possible so he stops and starts a hobby she \"approves of\"", "Bro has been playing in all female tauren groups, she can't handle the milk. \n\nThat being said I'd scream if it was actually WoW she was freaking out over, its so hard to make a good looking character with the age of the game. Can you imagine if he downloaded something like Lost Ark or Black Desert? She would spontaneously combust and the problem would be solved.", "Personally, I would just be honest and tell her to her face she is being really immature and pathetic. That's me though and it probably wouldn't go down well.", "Right? I don't think it's about how they look just that she \"Cant be sure they aren't played by female players!\"\n\nWhich makes me laugh cause playing WoW growing up, my best friend was a girl that only played male characters."]}
