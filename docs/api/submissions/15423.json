A few months ago he moved his gf in with him. I thought she was cool and all was fine until we were in a match one afternoon. Some randos joined our team, they had mics, turned out to be two women playing. No problem on our end but his gf wasn't thrilled and didn't want him playing with any women. He wanted to respect her boundaries so he left the game and afterward, whenever we'd play games that we use mics and pick up randoms, we'd only play if we wound up with all guy teammates. The real problem popped up when we were playing a different game, queued up for a dungeon, and we wound up with three people in our party using women characters. She didn't like that either because my brother couldn't tell for sure if the players themselves were men or women.\n\nFor a little while I stuck it out and we wound up spending most of our time just trying to find other players that didn't step over his gf's boundaries. Honestly, I felt like we were being creepy asking players if they were a guy or gal before playing. On top of that, trying to find a party that would meet her approval if she saw him playing really cut into my limited time a lot of days. I went from playing with him two to three times a week in the afternoon to maybe once a week and it's not consistent. It's his relationship and I respect that so I didn't want to say anything and just started playing later at night for a little bit after my kids are in bed instead of in the afternoons.\n\nYesterday I went to a friend's house for their birthday and my brother and his gf were there. Things were fine until I was leaving and my brother asked if I wanted to play later this coming week, I said I'd see. He brought up how I barely play with him any more and I told him \"Nothing against you (his gf) but between work and kids I get limited time to play and I don't want to spend it looking for players that only use e-peen characters because she can't deal with pixel women being around your pixels, and I'm tired of sounding like a creep.\" I left, and got a text from him late last night that they've been fighting, and he gets why I said it because he gets frustrated too but I shouldn't have said anything and just dealt with it in silence as he does.

I think, ultimately, you did him a huge favor by bringing her insecurity out into the open.", "NTA. HE can to walk on eggshells if HE wants to, but you don't. Limited game time was probably the outcome girlfriend wanted, though. Red flag?", "NTA. Even if she was in the right (she wasn't) you were respectful in your statement & def weren't the ass.", "That's the really weird part! She doesn't have any issues with his female co-workers or the few female friends he has. Just something about pixel women and women gamers I guess?", "Hope there\u2019s some all male cast shows on netflix. Imagine if a woman appeared on the tv when he\u2019s watching something, the gf would lose her marbles", "Any recommendations how to address it with her lol", "She's controlling. This if he was doing this to her? It's no less abusive because she's a girl.", "Maybe your brother was being inappropriate with female gamers in the past and that's why she has only this really annoying and extreme boundary and why your brother is willing to put up with it and wants you to deal with it in silence? That's the only reason I can think other women are seemingly fine to her.", "Do not address it with her. Address it with your brother. He's already said that you should have \"dealt with it in silence\" which makes me wonder what other controlling things she does that he hes afraid to talk about. I'm not gonna say this is certainly an abusive relationship based on this one thing, but it's not a good sign.", "Is it an issue that expands beyond just games?  I had an ex who would get mad if I said thank you to the cashier the wrong way.  If it's a jealousy issue then it is her problem to resolve.  She is unlikely to realize on her own she needs to change.  Your brother should be the one to bring it up and I guarantee that will not go well.  \n  \nIn reality I would think this is relationship terminating.  If you're dedicated to doing something about it yourself you should just ask her why she is concerned about playing games with women online or in character.  Explain the issue, that it's impacting the time your brother and you spend together.  Remind her he is there to play with you, not the randos.  Offer a concession like muting the lobby when you get in.  \n  \nIf you bring it up be prepared for her to try and cut you out of your brother's life.", "You don\u2019t address it with her. You provide your brother with support so he can address it with her.", "All of this. Dealing with things in silence is how abusers and coercive controllers get away with stuff. It's not your job or place to address anything with her but make clear to your brother you're there if he needs support (i.e. in leaving the relationship....) and that you're always down to game - JUST with him. Her behaviour is not reasonable and people should not excuse it.", "No that's the weirdest thing about it all. She has no problem with his female co-workers and is friends with the few female friends my brother has. After the mic party incident, I asked him about how she was with his female friends and she's still fine with them- just something about girls online apparently.", "How old is she?  How long have they been dating in general?  It's a really weird hangup, maybe one that can be resolved just by talking to her.  The standard reddit thing would be to say run, but I understand that is often somewhat knee-jerk.  That being said, having been in a similar relationship, it starts more with not wanting \"new\" female friends introduced before doubling down and starting to make accusations of infidelity.  At a minimum he needs to be on the lookout for signs she's trying to tighten down.  Control issues like this come from insecurity.  \n  \nIf you talk to her, the above is the best advice I can give.  She needs to know that the game time is about you two, not the other people online.  I don't know what help there is with her being concerned about female characters.  You may be able to get her into some games a bit to maybe show her it's harmless.  It's your brother's relationship so obviously it will be his call, but just be aware and be there for him.  If she is doing other controlling things she will be actively trying to make him think other people are like this.  Remind him that most people aren't this crazy from time to time, because my situation became very isolating and felt hopeless.  I hope the same does not happen to him.", "Thin end of the wedge. This will escalate. She starts with girls her has no prior relationship with, get him used to obeying her demands. Then she doesn't want him doing overtime if its just other girls at work. Then she doesn't want him to see his female friends if she's not there.\n\nThis is control. Not boundaries, boundaries are aboutyour self not other people. She needs to go to therapy for her insecurities and not make them his problem.", "She's 27 and they've been together something like a year and a half. I will still be there for him, the only thing that's changed is my not gaming. Only reason I asked about speaking with her is that obviously, I'm still going to have to be around her and being prepared if she brings it up again.", "I think \u0131ts not about women but about you.

I would hate to be in your position dealing with that.\n\nThen, I imagine saying that to my husband \"no playing games with other chicks..... \" and I feel like some insecure, immature pyscho.\n\nYea, I hope your brother has a lot of fun with that somehow because most reasonable people would hate to be dealing with that", "Girlfriend is a huge control freak.

You are not the one in the relationship, you did stay silent for awhile and honestly he asked why and you answered him. \n\nFor me personally, I am in a relationship with a guy who loves to game, I knew this before we started dating and know he plays with both men and women.

There are more and more female gamers. Unless someone has 24 hours a day to game or they only play in private parties, it's almost impossible to find an online group with no female gamers or gamers using female avatars. \nMy husband and I game, usually not together. He likes FPS games (Battlefield, CoD) while I like sandbox RPGs (Skyrim, Fable). I've had female friends and acquaintances be genuinely surprised that I don't care that my husband games. I always answer that I knew this was a hobby of his before we got serious, I know where he is (in the living room), and if I or our daughter needs something, he responds. They then explain that, to them, it looks like he's ignoring me or not spending time with me. It sounds like this is the case with the gf. She won't buck up and say that she wants more attention so she's making it so frustrating for him to game without pissing her off that he'll stop on his own. \nI find it very, very disturbing that he actually said you should 'suffer in silence' like he does. That's not a healthy relationship dynamic AT ALL.", "It's actually kind of hilarious how insecure his gf is. At least from the outside looking in. It must be maddening for you.

He likes living with his GF for other reason. There is no upside to you in tolerating it and it makes you uncomfortable. He should respect your boundaries as much as he respects his GF's.", "NTA he needed to hear how fucked in this was.\n\nAlso I feel really bad for the women you encounter and bail on. It hurts to be treated that way even if you two have good intentions", "Nope, NTA.

She\u2019s controlling and it\u2019s a major red flag. \n\nSaw the comment about supposedly not having issues with co-workers and existing female friends. You don\u2019t know how long that will last. It may be easier to start with barring online female gamers and avatars then, shift to Boys Nights and Girls Nights exclusively; or, slowly losing touch/being too busy to hang out with the female friends until they stop trying to get together. Or, it could be she\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll meet someone new through gaming and dump her. Absolutely none of it is okay or anything your brother should put up with. I suggest you talk to him and show him this thread. But he needs to address the issues in the relationship and understand that she\u2019s not setting boundaries, she\u2019s manipulating and controlling him. \n\nAn example of her setting a healthy boundary would be if she didn\u2019t like the general content of a game he plays (maybe she doesn\u2019t like guns or gore), so she plans to go out with her own friends during that time to avoid being exposed to it. That\u2019s an appropriate boundary that solves her problem while not interfering with how her boyfriend lives his life.", "NTA \u2014 why should you have just dealt with it in silence?\n\nIf he chooses to tolerate his partners ridiculous insecurity and controlling behaviour, then that\u2019s on him. If it affects his other relationships, that\u2019s his choice.

In essence, her manipulation is controlling both of you. \n\nYou\u2019re smart enough to back out, hopefully your brother opens his eyes a bit puts an end to this weird and petty dynamic one way or another. \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "This is absolutely nuts and wow, he's really in the deep end if he thinks \"you should suffer in silence like I do.\" I'm so sorry to hear this. Oh, and NTA.", "As a mmorpg player, maybe even your same mmorpg (you can find out from my post history if you care to): I'd resume playing with them and change my character into the sexiest female character model with the most outrageous skin baring equipment I could conceive of.", "My ex wife would act like this whenever my brother and I tried playing games or doing anything together. Her excuse was other women, whether pixelated or not. It wasn't actually about the women, just that I was trying to spend time with someone other than her. 100% not about the women. You sir, are NTA. Hopefully, your brother will wise up like I did and kick her to the curb", "Does she have an issue if they watch a movie and a women appears?", "She's either building up to keeping him away from all women, or she's just trying to stop him gaming at all.", "She probably does have issues with other women but can\u2019t control that so she\u2019s focusing on pixel women", "She doesn\u2019t like him playing games so much and is trying to control that is what\u2019s I\u2019d guess", "You can tell her that female players already have a hard time in finding players who accept the fact they're playing with girls. \n\nIt would be very cool to not have to deal with their partners too.", "He *was* \u201cdealing with it in silence\u201d.

He can\u2019t expect other people to continue to choose the limits required to play with him. \n\nAnd blaming fighting with his girlfriend over her weird controlling streak during gaming on OP is a low blow. Especially when he\u2019s the one who demanded that OP give reasons for his reduced availability, then took that to his girlfriend instead of speaking up on his own behalf.\n\n(Edit) I wasn\u2019t expecting ~~the Spanish Inquisition~~ a gold award.

It's just terrible. If we were out and I vaguely look at an [attractive] women's direction, I was \"checking them out\". If I was polite to [attractive] servicewomen, was because I was interested.\n\nShe had no problems with my female coworkers until a new [attractive] intern started working. Me mentoring the intern was me trying to get it on with her.\n\nThe last straw was when we were on my aunt's home for holiday, and a cousin came to visit my aunt with her 14 years old child.\n\nI'm very close with this cousin since I was a child, and have know all their children and am close to them as well. Then she accused me of being too friendly with the 14 years old. And that just did it to me.\n\nI had been conditioned to accept her jealousy bit by bit. Until she would check my phone. Read my emails. Distance myself from female friends. And like the frog in the water being boiled little by little I didn't noticed how fucked up it was.\n\nBut that did it. It was the shock that woke me and made me realize how absurd everything was.", "Sadly, I don't know how it is for OP, but if we are indeed playing the same game, we can't really customize our characters without paying real money, especially not our genders.\n\nBut yeah, I'd say playing around with glamours is half of my endgame now that I'm finished with most of current content...
