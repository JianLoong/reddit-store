A few months ago he moved his gf in with him. I thought she was cool and all was fine until we were in a match one afternoon. Some randos joined our team, they had mics, turned out to be two women playing. No problem on our end but his gf wasn't thrilled and didn't want him playing with any women. He wanted to respect her boundaries so he left the game and afterward, whenever we'd play games that we use mics and pick up randoms, we'd only play if we wound up with all guy teammates. The real problem popped up when we were playing a different game, queued up for a dungeon, and we wound up with three people in our party using women characters. She didn't like that either because my brother couldn't tell for sure if the players themselves were men or women.\n\nFor a little while I stuck it out and we wound up spending most of our time just trying to find other players that didn't step over his gf's boundaries. Honestly, I felt like we were being creepy asking players if they were a guy or gal before playing. On top of that, trying to find a party that would meet her approval if she saw him playing really cut into my limited time a lot of days. I went from playing with him two to three times a week in the afternoon to maybe once a week and it's not consistent. It's his relationship and I respect that so I didn't want to say anything and just started playing later at night for a little bit after my kids are in bed instead of in the afternoons.\n\nYesterday I went to a friend's house for their birthday and my brother and his gf were there. Things were fine until I was leaving and my brother asked if I wanted to play later this coming week, I said I'd see. He brought up how I barely play with him any more and I told him \"Nothing against you (his gf) but between work and kids I get limited time to play and I don't want to spend it looking for players that only use e-peen characters because she can't deal with pixel women being around your pixels, and I'm tired of sounding like a creep.\" I left, and got a text from him late last night that they've been fighting, and he gets why I said it because he gets frustrated too but I shouldn't have said anything and just dealt with it in silence as he does.

I think, ultimately, you did him a huge favor by bringing her insecurity out into the open.", "NTA. HE can to walk on eggshells if HE wants to, but you don't. Limited game time was probably the outcome girlfriend wanted, though. Red flag?", "NTA. Even if she was in the right (she wasn't) you were respectful in your statement & def weren't the ass.", "That's the really weird part! She doesn't have any issues with his female co-workers or the few female friends he has. Just something about pixel women and women gamers I guess?", "Hope there\u2019s some all male cast shows on netflix. Imagine if a woman appeared on the tv when he\u2019s watching something, the gf would lose her marbles", "Any recommendations how to address it with her lol", "She's controlling. This if he was doing this to her? It's no less abusive because she's a girl.", "Maybe your brother was being inappropriate with female gamers in the past and that's why she has only this really annoying and extreme boundary and why your brother is willing to put up with it and wants you to deal with it in silence? That's the only reason I can think other women are seemingly fine to her.", "Do not address it with her. Address it with your brother. He's already said that you should have \"dealt with it in silence\" which makes me wonder what other controlling things she does that he hes afraid to talk about. I'm not gonna say this is certainly an abusive relationship based on this one thing, but it's not a good sign.", "Is it an issue that expands beyond just games?  I had an ex who would get mad if I said thank you to the cashier the wrong way.  If it's a jealousy issue then it is her problem to resolve.  She is unlikely to realize on her own she needs to change.  Your brother should be the one to bring it up and I guarantee that will not go well.  \n  \nIn reality I would think this is relationship terminating.  If you're dedicated to doing something about it yourself you should just ask her why she is concerned about playing games with women online or in character.  Explain the issue, that it's impacting the time your brother and you spend together.  Remind her he is there to play with you, not the randos.  Offer a concession like muting the lobby when you get in.  \n  \nIf you bring it up be prepared for her to try and cut you out of your brother's life.", "You don\u2019t address it with her. You provide your brother with support so he can address it with her.", "All of this. Dealing with things in silence is how abusers and coercive controllers get away with stuff. It's not your job or place to address anything with her but make clear to your brother you're there if he needs support (i.e. in leaving the relationship....) and that you're always down to game - JUST with him. Her behaviour is not reasonable and people should not excuse it.", "No that's the weirdest thing about it all. She has no problem with his female co-workers and is friends with the few female friends my brother has. After the mic party incident, I asked him about how she was with his female friends and she's still fine with them- just something about girls online apparently.", "How old is she?  How long have they been dating in general?  It's a really weird hangup, maybe one that can be resolved just by talking to her.  The standard reddit thing would be to say run, but I understand that is often somewhat knee-jerk.  That being said, having been in a similar relationship, it starts more with not wanting \"new\" female friends introduced before doubling down and starting to make accusations of infidelity.  At a minimum he needs to be on the lookout for signs she's trying to tighten down.  Control issues like this come from insecurity.  \n  \nIf you talk to her, the above is the best advice I can give.  She needs to know that the game time is about you two, not the other people online.  I don't know what help there is with her being concerned about female characters.  You may be able to get her into some games a bit to maybe show her it's harmless.  It's your brother's relationship so obviously it will be his call, but just be aware and be there for him.  If she is doing other controlling things she will be actively trying to make him think other people are like this.  Remind him that most people aren't this crazy from time to time, because my situation became very isolating and felt hopeless.  I hope the same does not happen to him.", "Thin end of the wedge. This will escalate. She starts with girls her has no prior relationship with, get him used to obeying her demands. Then she doesn't want him doing overtime if its just other girls at work. Then she doesn't want him to see his female friends if she's not there.\n\nThis is control. Not boundaries, boundaries are aboutyour self not other people. She needs to go to therapy for her insecurities and not make them his problem.", "She's 27 and they've been together something like a year and a half. I will still be there for him, the only thing that's changed is my not gaming. Only reason I asked about speaking with her is that obviously, I'm still going to have to be around her and being prepared if she brings it up again.", "I think \u0131ts not about women but about you.

I would hate to be in your position dealing with that.\n\nThen, I imagine saying that to my husband \"no playing games with other chicks..... \" and I feel like some insecure, immature pyscho.\n\nYea, I hope your brother has a lot of fun with that somehow because most reasonable people would hate to be dealing with that", "Girlfriend is a huge control freak.

You are not the one in the relationship, you did stay silent for awhile and honestly he asked why and you answered him. \n\nFor me personally, I am in a relationship with a guy who loves to game, I knew this before we started dating and know he plays with both men and women.

There are more and more female gamers. Unless someone has 24 hours a day to game or they only play in private parties, it's almost impossible to find an online group with no female gamers or gamers using female avatars. \nMy husband and I game, usually not together. He likes FPS games (Battlefield, CoD) while I like sandbox RPGs (Skyrim, Fable). I've had female friends and acquaintances be genuinely surprised that I don't care that my husband games. I always answer that I knew this was a hobby of his before we got serious, I know where he is (in the living room), and if I or our daughter needs something, he responds. They then explain that, to them, it looks like he's ignoring me or not spending time with me. It sounds like this is the case with the gf. She won't buck up and say that she wants more attention so she's making it so frustrating for him to game without pissing her off that he'll stop on his own. \nI find it very, very disturbing that he actually said you should 'suffer in silence' like he does. That's not a healthy relationship dynamic AT ALL.", "It's actually kind of hilarious how insecure his gf is. At least from the outside looking in. It must be maddening for you.

He likes living with his GF for other reason. There is no upside to you in tolerating it and it makes you uncomfortable. He should respect your boundaries as much as he respects his GF's.", "NTA he needed to hear how fucked in this was.\n\nAlso I feel really bad for the women you encounter and bail on. It hurts to be treated that way even if you two have good intentions", "Nope, NTA.

She\u2019s controlling and it\u2019s a major red flag. \n\nSaw the comment about supposedly not having issues with co-workers and existing female friends. You don\u2019t know how long that will last. It may be easier to start with barring online female gamers and avatars then, shift to Boys Nights and Girls Nights exclusively; or, slowly losing touch/being too busy to hang out with the female friends until they stop trying to get together. Or, it could be she\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll meet someone new through gaming and dump her. Absolutely none of it is okay or anything your brother should put up with. I suggest you talk to him and show him this thread. But he needs to address the issues in the relationship and understand that she\u2019s not setting boundaries, she\u2019s manipulating and controlling him. \n\nAn example of her setting a healthy boundary would be if she didn\u2019t like the general content of a game he plays (maybe she doesn\u2019t like guns or gore), so she plans to go out with her own friends during that time to avoid being exposed to it. That\u2019s an appropriate boundary that solves her problem while not interfering with how her boyfriend lives his life.", "NTA \u2014 why should you have just dealt with it in silence?\n\nIf he chooses to tolerate his partners ridiculous insecurity and controlling behaviour, then that\u2019s on him. If it affects his other relationships, that\u2019s his choice.

In essence, her manipulation is controlling both of you. \n\nYou\u2019re smart enough to back out, hopefully your brother opens his eyes a bit puts an end to this weird and petty dynamic one way or another. \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "This is absolutely nuts and wow, he's really in the deep end if he thinks \"you should suffer in silence like I do.\" I'm so sorry to hear this. Oh, and NTA.", "As a mmorpg player, maybe even your same mmorpg (you can find out from my post history if you care to): I'd resume playing with them and change my character into the sexiest female character model with the most outrageous skin baring equipment I could conceive of.", "My ex wife would act like this whenever my brother and I tried playing games or doing anything together. Her excuse was other women, whether pixelated or not. It wasn't actually about the women, just that I was trying to spend time with someone other than her. 100% not about the women. You sir, are NTA. Hopefully, your brother will wise up like I did and kick her to the curb", "Does she have an issue if they watch a movie and a women appears?", "She's either building up to keeping him away from all women, or she's just trying to stop him gaming at all.", "She probably does have issues with other women but can\u2019t control that so she\u2019s focusing on pixel women", "She doesn\u2019t like him playing games so much and is trying to control that is what\u2019s I\u2019d guess", "You can tell her that female players already have a hard time in finding players who accept the fact they're playing with girls. \n\nIt would be very cool to not have to deal with their partners too.", "He *was* \u201cdealing with it in silence\u201d.

He can\u2019t expect other people to continue to choose the limits required to play with him. \n\nAnd blaming fighting with his girlfriend over her weird controlling streak during gaming on OP is a low blow. Especially when he\u2019s the one who demanded that OP give reasons for his reduced availability, then took that to his girlfriend instead of speaking up on his own behalf.\n\n(Edit) I wasn\u2019t expecting ~~the Spanish Inquisition~~ a gold award.

It's just terrible. If we were out and I vaguely look at an [attractive] women's direction, I was \"checking them out\". If I was polite to [attractive] servicewomen, was because I was interested.\n\nShe had no problems with my female coworkers until a new [attractive] intern started working. Me mentoring the intern was me trying to get it on with her.\n\nThe last straw was when we were on my aunt's home for holiday, and a cousin came to visit my aunt with her 14 years old child.\n\nI'm very close with this cousin since I was a child, and have know all their children and am close to them as well. Then she accused me of being too friendly with the 14 years old. And that just did it to me.\n\nI had been conditioned to accept her jealousy bit by bit. Until she would check my phone. Read my emails. Distance myself from female friends. And like the frog in the water being boiled little by little I didn't noticed how fucked up it was.\n\nBut that did it. It was the shock that woke me and made me realize how absurd everything was.", "Sadly, I don't know how it is for OP, but if we are indeed playing the same game, we can't really customize our characters without paying real money, especially not our genders.\n\nBut yeah, I'd say playing around with glamours is half of my endgame now that I'm finished with most of current content...

It\u2019s probably good you said it out loud and they\u2019re arguing about it finally bc honestly she needs therapy for her weird jealousy and maybe they could use couples therapy too to smooth things over.\nOr maybe they\u2019ll break up. Who knows. She\u2019s not a good partner tho for this weird control she insists on having over his online life", "NTA.\n\nDamn this is insane. I'm a woman who games, and my boyfriend games too. We primarily play Valorant and he gets woman in his team and I get men in my team quite frequently as you could imagine.\n\nMe and my boyfriend have also made some gamer friends of the opposite sex and it's never been an issue between us. \n\nYour brother's girlfriend sounds very controlling, it's concerning that she gets upset over the female characters??? Bruh. Valorant has got male and female characters and me and my partner joke about the attractive ones lmao, idk. Some people have boundaries but I feel like your brother's girlfriend's ones are very extreme.", "NTA\n\nShe's insecure, controlling, toxic and abusive.\n\nYour brother is enabling her when the truth is that her insecurities are her problem.\n\nIt's been a decent amount of time and even though he's been placating her she instead got WORSE and now she can't even handle digital women.\n\nShe's honestly mentally unwell, but that doesn't excuse this level of toxic behavior.\n\nYou did the right thing. Someone had to say it.", "NTA. Boundaries are boundaries are boundaries. She set hers, you set yours.", "NTA. You were incredibly nice in what you said. You could have gone a lot further than that. It\u2019s really weird how insecure she is; but also controlling. I suspect that this issue amongst them is a teeny tiny tip of the iceberg of what\u2019s really going on; not that it\u2019s anyone\u2019s business.", "From what I've read of your responses to people, it sounds like she's most likely jealous of you two spending time together, or she hates video games and she's just using being jealous over pixelated women as the excuse, I'm sure because she knows/thinks if she downright forbade him from playing with you he'd tell her to kick rocks. \n\nI had a friend that had a gf that did this, and she finally admitted she just hated video games and that it had nothing to do with the female game characters or players, except for me(female gamer) she hated my guts but since I was super close with his whole family and babysat his sister all the time, I wasn't going anywhere. We had no desire to date, we had tried it, and even though we were 16/17, we had mutually agreed that we worked better as friends and we didn't want anything more than that, heck I still call his little sister, my little sister and his mom is Momma T whenever I see her.", "NTA. Gf needs to grow up and your brother needs to grow a pair.", "Damn, that girlfriend is a walking red flag. I hope your brother wises up soon. Ask him if a woman he cared about was dating a guy who was that jealous and controlling, would he recommend she stay in that relationship?", "NTA: however maybe ask her is she was cheated on or picked over for a game. I once dated a guy who played WOW he would often invite me over only to play for HOURS\u2026 I finally just stopped going to his place. He then asked me to watch him play softball (IRL) after the 2.5 hours I asked what his plans were.. he had a \u201craid\u201d I was done. After that anyone who played games was off my list as I did not like being a second choice. Maybe there\u2019s something deeper going on with her. Or she\u2019s just insecure\u2026", "NTA\n\nWhy should you have to deal with it in silence like he does. He shouldn\u2019t have to be dealing with it at all. His girlfriend is controlling. Now she is effecting your relationship with your brother. Sounds to me like she is trying to isolate him. He is lose a lot of people in his life.\n\nDoes she seriously think that all gamer girls are going to try take him from her? Gamer girls are there to play the game. They don\u2019t care about the guys.", "NTA\n\nHer behavior is far too controlling. Her boundaries need to go around her, not your brother. That's not how healthy boundaries work at all.", "your bf is a coward \n\nand is upset you're not lol nta", "NTA And why are \\*they\\* fighting about what you said? It's not your fault that they were fighting. It's on him and how he handled what happened later.\n\n(And no need to explain why they were fighting. He obviously didn't throw you under the bus hard enough and probably even agreed with you and that's what the fight was about. Still on him though.)", "NTA, he is not a child.", "That's not a boundary. It's a control issue. \n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 All over the place. \n\nNTA", "Nta\n\nShe is way too controlling. He needs to put his foot down. She is isolating him too much. She is ruining your game time with him and it has to stop. Tell him you aren\u2019t abiding by her rules anymore and suggest he do the same.", "Glad you were able to set your boundary, hope you're brother can figure out out to do the same.", "NTA and as a female gamer your brothers GF is offensive to me", "NTA. If she is jealous of internet women, she is probably jealous of his women friends and coworkers, too, but hasn't shown that side yet.  He can suffer in silence, but that doesn't mean you have to waste your time trying to play by her rules.", "NTA", "Being honest is never wrong, sure he didn\u2019t like it but he wasn\u2019t left wondering. NTA", "Tell your brother that his girlfriend isn't just being ridiculous in this jealous behavior but even more, she is being controlling and the more he ignores this behavior the worse it will get.  Prime example, he has now lost out on having a close relationship with you because of her behavior. She has only begun to demonstrate who she is and how she behaves in terms of their relationship, it will only get worse.  Ask your brother to name some couples that he admires and then ask him how those couples relate to each other and their friends of both sexes. Then ask him if he really wants to raise kids with a woman who shows such a lack of respect towards him with this controlling behavior. Edit: NTA", "Nta. These are not boundaries this is called being controlling.", "NTA\n\nPixels? How fucking fragile is her ego and/or their relationship. Is he allowed to wear a pink shirt? What about pink socks? Gimme a break.", "NTA, your bro can decide if she gets to be possessive with him, but that doesn't mean you have to suffer through it.", "It's not your relationship, why do you need to 'deal with it'?\n\nActually, you are dealing with it by removing yourself from the game.  You don't need to deal with it by involving yourself in a difficult scenario and experiencing the unpleasantness.", "NTA. She's honestly a walking Red Flag and he should break up with her.", "NTA. Just because he wants to \u201csuffer in silence\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you have to, after all, you aren\u2019t in a relationship with her!", "NTA your brother may think he has to put up with it but you in no way have to accommodate her rediculous crap!!!", "Your brother needs to get out of this relationship.  Some scary red flags here.", "NTA his GF needs to get some self esteem", "NTA\n\nShe sounds controlling, insecure and almost abusive.", "\"I shouldn't have said anything about it.\"\n\nHe brought it up.\n\nNTA", "She's ridiculous. I can't imagine giving two shits if my boyfriend was playing online with women, whether they're women in cyberspace or meatspace or both. If he's done something to make me mistrust him, I won't date him. If he's not done so, then I don't really care. If he's having fun and he's happy and healthy, then I'm happy.\n\nNow, if your brother wants to be with this woman, that's his choice. But you don't have to get dragged into that. You were honest in a respectful manner, and laid out boundaries, and then stayed out of their relationship. You've done nothing wrong, not towards others and not to yourself.\n\nNTA", "I didn't look at the ages at first and it wasn't until you.mentioned your kids that I did a double take. I had assumed from what you were writing she was some kind of insecure child but no turns out she's an adult...wow your NTA, she needs to chill the fuc out and your brother unfortunately needs to man up and set some boundaries", "NTA.  What an insecure chick.  This relationship will blow up eventually.", "I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong", "Is it possible, while you guys are playing, gf wears a head set and listens in? She may feel more secure if she understands the group dynamics.", "She's forcing you two to act like gamer-guy misogynists. I don't blame you for being really uncomfortable with it. Stopping playing with them was probably the best solution, and needing to explain why was inevitable. Any arguments they get in after that are out of your control.\n\nNTA", "He asked me with her right there.", "20 bucks says she caught him watching pixel porn haha but NTA mate, she needs to get her head read. She\u2019s a walking red flag and your bro outta tap out", "I\u2019ll party with you. I\u2019ll explain to the GF that I\u2019m a 54 year old grandmother with a preference for using hot pixel chic avatars. I may mention how ridiculous she is being, just for fun.", "Your brother shouldn't be dealing with it in silence either, that's his (very bad) choice. You were much nicer than I would have been. NTA", "She doesn\u2019t want to impact his income, she just wants to completely ruin his (and now yours) hobbies.", "Just remember, it may be his choice to put up with controlling, borderline abusive behavior in silence, but that doesn\u2019t mean he gets to choose for you how you\u2019ll react. It\u2019s pretty clear he knows this is ridiculous and probably is putting up with it either because of the idea women can do no wrong/can\u2019t control/abuse a man or because he thinks he can\u2019t do better than this woman. Either way, it\u2019s not your job to keep the peace in someone else\u2019s toxic relationship.", "That's because she's proven she can control his gaming habits. She can't control his work place because  she's  not the boss. 100%, if she did own a company or some job and her boyfriend worked there, there would be 0 female coworkers. As for his female friends, she probably doesn't want to get called out for her behavior. You're  probably the first person to do so.", "I think she knows better than to not raise an issue with women he works with - that's his livelihood. This is something she can (and does) control. Watch...you're going to start seeing her limit his interactions with women in his life till there's no one left.", "She doesn't have a problem in front of you, but I bet he has all kinds of rules about hanging out with fem folks in person too that she imposes that you don't know about.", "You remind your brother her behavior isn\u2019t normal, it isn\u2019t healthy, and while you support him and will always be there for him, you aren\u2019t going to enable toxic behavior from her and just remind him that you\u2019re there for him if he realizes this isn\u2019t what he wants in a relationship anymore.", "It's really his job to address it with her. Sounds to me like she just doesn't want him to play games anymore and this is the easiest way for her to shut him down when he wants to play. She sounds controlling and unreasonable. You are definitely NTA.", "Tell him to put on his big boy pants and to grow up!", "Seriously.\nIn FFXIV  I am most likely examining a players glam. Imagining what is under it appeals to me not a whit.", "Aw, you mean you *don't* want to have a pillow fight with me and my hot cousins? We're all covered in Dorito dust, our sweatshirts are older than the Sega corporation, and the rips are not in sexy places! Pretty sure there's popcorn in my bra.", "Maybe he was counting on your truthful answer because he's tired of her ridiculous gamer girl rules? Hopefully this will allow him to speak up and establish his own boundaries. She is really disrespectful and controlling to him.", "I think if we flipped the genders, more would call this behavior already outright controlling and abusive. I too wonder what else she\u2019s controlling in his life.", "I'm gonna say it! It's got the hallmarks of early stage abuse. She's *already* got him too scared to stand up to her demands, so now he just capitulates in order to \"keep the peace.\" That is the groundwork laid, a firm foundation for all kinds of escalation. Just one more little thing to make the relationship *perfect!* Can't you just do it *for me,* baby? Just one more little thing. Always just one more thing, and always him giving up pieces of himself in order to appease her.\n\nI hope OP stays in touch with his brother, because this female gamer prohibition is likely only the beginning. The brother will need support and a safety net.", "no excuse to be abusive.", "Our traumas and problems are also our responsibilities to deal with.", "\"on her own\". Have you ever seen the two of them spending time with his female friends?", "Being friends with the female friends means nothing besides that she's possibly keeping tabs on shit. We all know, at least tangentially, someone whose partner cheated with a sibling/cousin/friend of their partner. Proximity creates opportunity.\n\nI'm friends or at least friendly with all of my fiance's friends of all genders. And he has quite a few attractive coworkers... Some of whom I used to work with and referred to his boss because it's the same industry and we were warned in advance of potential layoffs while his team was hiring. Sometimes they go to work lunches. \n\nI trust, in general, that my partner will behave in the way we have agreed upon regarding sexual contact with others. \n\nI trust, completely, that I will eventually be fine if he breaches that trust I have in him. That's the important part to me. That if I misplace trust... My grandmother was healthy until 5 days before she passed. At 102. I could have another 60 years. No misplaced dick is worth the effort to isolate loved ones from potential threats to my ego.", "Yeah, this is just levels of insane.\n\nI usually play female characters simply because I prefer their voices. If I'm going to listen to a computer speak at me for hours, I just prefer that kind of voicing.", "Lmao the WoW characters aren't even good looking, FFXIV ones are a lot more scandalous, but *so many* guys I've ever played with (I'm a woman and love MMOs) play female characters bc they like to look at them while they spend hours on the game. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nMan I would dump my husband if he gave a fuck about whether my guild had men in it, like that's just too weird to think about.", "You might want to let it be at \"the timing just doesn't work for me right now\" because it's kind of true and will stir up less shit for your brother than if you call her out.\n\n(I think he would be better off without her from your description, but that's on him.)\n\nIf she pushes about it, but only if she pushes about it, I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that you're pressed for time and her insistence on curating the team isn't your style. You want to play immediately, she doesn't. Your brother now wants to curate, you don't. You want to engage with complete strangers and see what happens and aren't open to debate about that.", "I'm a 27 year old woman and I can't even imagine acting like this 15 years ago."]}
