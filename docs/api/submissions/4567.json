Alex and I have been friends since 5th grade and we are now roommates as Alex moved back to our hometown for a job.  She\u2019s set to move into her own apartment in January but shes been with me since October.\n\nI own a small house with 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, so Alex gets her privacy and I have mine.  We\u2019ve had no issues.\n\nI hosted Thanksgiving this year with my mom, my brother Matt, my aunt, uncle, and little cousin Susie (4f).  Everything went fine\u2026Alex went to her mom\u2019s house, so she wasn\u2019t there.\n\nBut Alex noticed one of her stuffed animals, a dinosaur I\u2019ll call Lucy, was missing.  Alex loves stuffed animals and Lucy and another stuffed animals were her favorite.  They are what she told me her \u201csensory items\u201d (Alex is on the autism spectrum, high functioning, diagnosed 2 years ago).  My family doesn\u2019t know Alex is autistic as I swore to keep it a secret.  She doesn\u2019t want anyone to know.  But I helped her look for Lucy for over a week and we couldn\u2019t find her.  Alex has been depressed and crying over this since Thanksgiving.\n\nI went to my mom\u2019s house on Saturday and my aunt and Susie were there.  Susie was sitting at the table holding Lucy.  I wasn\u2019t super sure so I took a photo of everyone, and sent it to Alex and she confirmed it was Lucy.\n\nI told my aunt that Lucy belonged to my roommate and went to take it.  Susie snatched it back and yelled at me and my aunt asked what I was doing.  I told her I was taking back Lucy, that this toy wasn\u2019t Susie\u2019s.  My aunt insisted it came from Susie\u2019s preschool since that\u2019s what she told her, but I showed her the message Alex sent me confirming this was indeed Lucy.\n\nI reached for it and my aunt pushed my hand away.  My mom asked us both to stop and asked Susie where she got the toy.  Susie insisted she found it her preschool but I knew she was lying.\n\nI texted Alex and asked for a photo of  Lucy and she sent me one of her from high school or college holding Lucy.  It had the same bleach stain on its side, so my mom sided with me and said Susie needed to give it back.  My aunt called me and Alex ridiculous, and that Susie is too attached to it, and still swore it was from her preschool.  Susie said the same thing.\n\nSo, not my proudest moment, but I snatched Lucy and left.  Yes, Susie was screaming.  But I brought Lucy back to Alex.\n\nAlex is grateful I found Lucy and brought her back and has been walking around with her since.  But my aunt called me a heartless cow for \u201ctraumatizing\u201d her daughter.  My uncle hasn\u2019t said anything as far as I know, but Matt knows and says I could\u2019ve handled it better since I was arguing with a 4 year old but said I ultimately did the right thing.  My mom agrees with Matt and said Susie was inconsolable when I left but it should\u2019ve been returned to Alex regardless.\n\nI know Lucy belongs to Alex but now I feel bad snatching a toy from a 4 year old the way I did knowing how attached she was to it and possibly scarring her.

Sure snatching a toy from a child can be painted as bad, but in all likelihood if they'd gone home with the toy you would never have seen it again. You calmly proved it was stolen and belonged to your roommate. It should have been immediately returned at that point.", "NTA you could not let them leave with it because it would have be gone forever.

There is absolutely nothing for you to feel sorry about.", "NTA - You showed your aunt proof that Lucy was your room mates stuffed dinosaur with the bleach stain. Your Aunt obviously was choosing to ignore facts to either avoid a tantrum from  having to give up the animal or to avoid admitting her 4-year old wrongfully took someone else's property.", "Your aunt should be ashamed of herself.  Even if it were to belong to preschool, it Lucy shouldn't be outside of preschool.", "NTA. You were arguing with a child and that child is your aunt.

She needs to learn young that STEALING is not appropriate.", "Absolutely NTA. I was the quintessential spoiled brat. I once visited some cousins for the first time, and insisted that they give me one of their stuffed toys. No one said anything, but this was something that no one offered me. I just said I wanted it, and there it was. I have felt guilty about that for years afterward, even though it has been at least four or five decades since I last knew the whereabouts of the toy. Parents can teach, train, and control their kids' impulses, especially when they are not good ones. Susie will get over it.

If she didn't steal it from Alex, then she stole it from her preschool.\n\nThat little girl is going to go through some \"real world\" problems down the road.

The sooner this little klepto learns about accountability, the better.", "NTA.\n\nIt might not be fair to say that Susie was lying. She's 4. Her understanding of truth and lies, and even her memory of where she got the toy, are very under-developed. But that's why the whims of a four-year old can't dictate adult actions.\n\nIdeally, you would have been able to handle this differently. Snatching the toy from a 4-year old isn't ideal. Explaining why it is clear that she's mistaken about where it came from, assuring her that she is not in trouble for her mistake, reminding her of how much she loves her toys and why it is not right to take the toys that other people love, and offering to help her find a similar toy of her own that she can love would all have been good.\n\nBut it was her own mom who made that impossible by backing her up and opposing you and trying to stop you", "NTA- Both you and Susie's mom could've handled it better, but ultimately you were in the right. \n\nHonestly, I would've stolen it back when she wasn't present or paying attention like she did to your friend.\n\nMom gets an easy out saying it just got lost, you got your toy back, you don't need to add to the little goblin's future trauma of being an entitled little kid whose mom covers for. Win/win/win", "NTA Little one\u2019s need to be taught it\u2019s wrong to steal. And that there\u2019s consequences if you do. I had a neighbour years ago who\u2019s kid was a thief. Stole from my kid and was banned from my house.", "Nta, she is a little liar. No need to feel sorry for her", "NTA. You did your niece a favor. Her mom is trying to turn her into an entitled monster no one can tolerate. Why someone would do that to their own kid is beyond me. But you mitigated the damage to that child a little bit.", "NTA - you didn't argue with a 4 year old, you argued with the mother of a 4 year old - who appears to have the same emotional intelligence as her daughter.\n\nKudos' to you for having your roommates back!", "This would have been the perfect opportunity for your Aunt and little Susie how bad stealing is. Smh. NTA", "NTA. Stealing is wrong, your niece learned a valuable lesson, your aunt is a fool and a bad parent, and your roommate is lucky to have you", "I'm not a child psychologist so f\\*\\*\\* me, but the kid will probably forget about the animal in a week. She won't forget so easily that you took something violently away from her and will probably hate you for a while or maybe even a long while; specially if her mother keeps feeding her hatred towards you, which i'm sure she will.  \nThat said: you're NTA for taking it back no matter what and i'm sure Alex will always remember it. But, as you said, you could've handled it better. Maybe not say she has autism, but that it has extreme sentimental value or something like that. Maybe talk to you aunt on the side and tell her to \"lose it\" while the kid isn't watching.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
