Alex and I have been friends since 5th grade and we are now roommates as Alex moved back to our hometown for a job.  She\u2019s set to move into her own apartment in January but shes been with me since October.\n\nI own a small house with 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, so Alex gets her privacy and I have mine.  We\u2019ve had no issues.\n\nI hosted Thanksgiving this year with my mom, my brother Matt, my aunt, uncle, and little cousin Susie (4f).  Everything went fine\u2026Alex went to her mom\u2019s house, so she wasn\u2019t there.\n\nBut Alex noticed one of her stuffed animals, a dinosaur I\u2019ll call Lucy, was missing.  Alex loves stuffed animals and Lucy and another stuffed animals were her favorite.  They are what she told me her \u201csensory items\u201d (Alex is on the autism spectrum, high functioning, diagnosed 2 years ago).  My family doesn\u2019t know Alex is autistic as I swore to keep it a secret.  She doesn\u2019t want anyone to know.  But I helped her look for Lucy for over a week and we couldn\u2019t find her.  Alex has been depressed and crying over this since Thanksgiving.\n\nI went to my mom\u2019s house on Saturday and my aunt and Susie were there.  Susie was sitting at the table holding Lucy.  I wasn\u2019t super sure so I took a photo of everyone, and sent it to Alex and she confirmed it was Lucy.\n\nI told my aunt that Lucy belonged to my roommate and went to take it.  Susie snatched it back and yelled at me and my aunt asked what I was doing.  I told her I was taking back Lucy, that this toy wasn\u2019t Susie\u2019s.  My aunt insisted it came from Susie\u2019s preschool since that\u2019s what she told her, but I showed her the message Alex sent me confirming this was indeed Lucy.\n\nI reached for it and my aunt pushed my hand away.  My mom asked us both to stop and asked Susie where she got the toy.  Susie insisted she found it her preschool but I knew she was lying.\n\nI texted Alex and asked for a photo of  Lucy and she sent me one of her from high school or college holding Lucy.  It had the same bleach stain on its side, so my mom sided with me and said Susie needed to give it back.  My aunt called me and Alex ridiculous, and that Susie is too attached to it, and still swore it was from her preschool.  Susie said the same thing.\n\nSo, not my proudest moment, but I snatched Lucy and left.  Yes, Susie was screaming.  But I brought Lucy back to Alex.\n\nAlex is grateful I found Lucy and brought her back and has been walking around with her since.  But my aunt called me a heartless cow for \u201ctraumatizing\u201d her daughter.  My uncle hasn\u2019t said anything as far as I know, but Matt knows and says I could\u2019ve handled it better since I was arguing with a 4 year old but said I ultimately did the right thing.  My mom agrees with Matt and said Susie was inconsolable when I left but it should\u2019ve been returned to Alex regardless.\n\nI know Lucy belongs to Alex but now I feel bad snatching a toy from a 4 year old the way I did knowing how attached she was to it and possibly scarring her.

Her understanding of truth and lies, and even her memory of where she got the toy, are very under-developed. But that's why the whims of a four-year old can't dictate adult actions.\n\nIdeally, you would have been able to handle this differently. Snatching the toy from a 4-year old isn't ideal. Explaining why it is clear that she's mistaken about where it came from, assuring her that she is not in trouble for her mistake, reminding her of how much she loves her toys and why it is not right to take the toys that other people love, and offering to help her find a similar toy of her own that she can love would all have been good.\n\nBut it was her own mom who made that impossible by backing her up and opposing you and trying to stop you", "NTA- Both you and Susie's mom could've handled it better, but ultimately you were in the right. \n\nHonestly, I would've stolen it back when she wasn't present or paying attention like she did to your friend.\n\nMom gets an easy out saying it just got lost, you got your toy back, you don't need to add to the little goblin's future trauma of being an entitled little kid whose mom covers for.

Her mom is trying to turn her into an entitled monster no one can tolerate. Why someone would do that to their own kid is beyond me. But you mitigated the damage to that child a little bit.", "NTA - you didn't argue with a 4 year old, you argued with the mother of a 4 year old - who appears to have the same emotional intelligence as her daughter.\n\nKudos' to you for having your roommates back!", "This would have been the perfect opportunity for your Aunt and little Susie how bad stealing is. Smh. NTA", "NTA. Stealing is wrong, your niece learned a valuable lesson, your aunt is a fool and a bad parent, and your roommate is lucky to have you", "I'm not a child psychologist so f\\*\\*\\* me, but the kid will probably forget about the animal in a week. She won't forget so easily that you took something violently away from her and will probably hate you for a while or maybe even a long while; specially if her mother keeps feeding her hatred towards you, which i'm sure she will.  \nThat said: you're NTA for taking it back no matter what and i'm sure Alex will always remember it. But, as you said, you could've handled it better. Maybe not say she has autism, but that it has extreme sentimental value or something like that.

Good for you for being a good friend and getting Lucy back to her rightful owner, she will certainly appreciate her more than the baby!\n\nEdit. Spelling.", "NTA, what were you suppose to do when your aunt wasn't stepping up and holding her own kid responsible? You did the right thing IMO, and I doubt your cousin is \"traumatized\", but she sure is on her way growing up to be an entitled brat.", "NTA. Four years old or not she stole and lied. Her mom supporting this is a huge red flag.", "NTA.\n\nYour aunt is though, particularly for aiding and abetting stealing and lying.\n\nNot a great start for Susie.", "NTA. Your aunt is willing to help your niece steal and lie to get her way. Not your fault and not your problem.", "NTA.  It's next to impossible to describe how I feel about the aunt without violating the rules.", "In the first place, the mother should not have let her sneak in your roomate bedroom. NTA", "NTA. \"Heartless cow.\" Lol. Wow. Yeah, I wouldn't dedicate much concern to your Aunt's opinion on this one.", "Who the hell takes a kid to a relatives house then sees them leave with a new stuffed animal without asking where it came from?\n\nLittle Susie might not know better yet but her mom sure should...\n\nNTA", "So much NTA. Well done for putting this right.  Your Aunt is an entitled piece of work and if she isn\u2019t challenged, Susie will end up the same. She stole and lied - her mother wanted to let her benefit from that.  That\u2019s messed up.", "Letting her get away with theft and lying would really scar her.\n\nYou did the right thing!", "Nta. You are teaching her that stealing is wrong.", "I'm autistic, i have a emotional support plushy and if ANYONE takes my duck without my consent i murder* them.\nNgl felt hard to even read this. Thank you for being the best bestfriend and roommate in history \n\nNTA ofc\n\n*Metaphorical", "All the comments about kids lying remind me of the time my niece spent the day with me and my son. She was about 3 or 4, and when her mom picked her up, she had a little toy in her hand and her mom asked where she got it. She said, \"I stole it from \"commenter's\" house. Next time I'm going to steal the little dinosaur.\" \ud83e\udd23", "NTA \n\nShe stole it. It was not hers. And since Aunt defended it and knew it was not hers, neither of them should be welcome at house again", "NTA", "NTA. Do I think you could have went about this gentler? Yes. Does it change the fact that the stuffed animal needed to be taken and given back to your roommate? No. And honestly it sounds like there wasn't going to be an easy way to fo this, with your cousins mom not cooperating. I'm not even autistic, and there are a few stuffed animals I would have insisted on being returned to me, because they mean so much. Like no. It did not belong to Susie it did Alex, the end.", "NTA  but boy, your aunt is.  No, it wasn't ideal. It wasn't ideal because your aunt refused to discipline her child.  Could have been a teaching moment about lying & stealing if conducted by a reasonable mother who wants her 4 yr old to be a decent human.  Instead you had to do what you had to do.  Hopefully, as another commenter mentioned, Susie learned a lesson. Unfortunately, it was the hard way.", "NTA", "NTA. You did the right thing. Your aunt is TA.", "Four years old isn't too young to be taught that lying is wrong and you can't just take what's not yours. I mean, for goodness sake, she knew to lie already. \n\nNTA", "Even a 4yo knows not to steal from other peoples houses and her mother absolutely knew when Lucy came home from your house !\n\nNTA and there is only 1 way to deal with this kind of lie - head on", "ESH. Aunt for obvious reasons but you shouldn\u2019t have snatched the toy.", "NTA but grown women fighting with a 4 year old over a stuffed animal is ridiculous.", "This is what we call a learning opportunity.  Your Aunt should have told Susie, \"Susie, this is the dinosaur that Ms. Alex has had for a very long time. It belongs to her.  You need to give it back to her.  I know we sometimes want things that are not ours, but we still don't get to take them from other people.\"", "It\u2019s pretty concerning that a 4 yo is able to lie this well and consistently, TBH.", "This sort of behavior in a toddler needs to get nipped in the bud too if they don't want her blossoming into an entitled AH when she's older.", "Exactly. How would a 4 year old have smuggled the stuffed animal home without her aunt noticing at any point? Aunt knew, didn't care, and is raising her daughter to be just as entitled as she us.", "Hell no, I'd find a book on stealing and give her that, not reward her by buying the thing she stole and lied about...", "I 100% agree. OP, good on you for taking the stuffed animal and returning it to your roomie. Susie will forget about this, she'll find another stuffed animal. And whether Alex is autistic or not is of little importance, it could've been something of sentimental value, or something she just loved.  You are NTA.", "The aunt and kid should not go over to OP\u2019s place again, not without a sincere apology from the aunt at least", "LOL calling the cops vs grabbing a stolen item out of a kids hands. What do you do when the kid is swinging scissors around? Cause according to you snatching anything out a kid hands is such an offense.", "Did it sound like to you that OP could have gotten the toy back by asking them nicely?", "IMO, Susie was \"inconsolable\" because she stole a toy, lied about it, got caught, and had the toy taken away. It's not just the toy that caused the distress, she also got caught and was probably afraid she'd get in trouble. At the very least, she knew that she caused her older cousin to be angry.", "4 year olds and even a bit older will swear up and down that a toy they have is theirs when it\u2019s clearly not. Once I was babysitting and two brothers were fighting over a Lego figure. The exact Lego figure was literally on the box that the younger brother had just been gifted that day, so it was obvious which brother was telling the truth. But the older one never changed his tune. The parents were in agreement with me so in the end he did have to give up the Lego figure. I think it\u2019s just kids being kids but obviously adults should know better.", "At that age, I think they can sometimes convince \\*themselves\\* that their story is true. I wouldn't worry too much about the child just based on her insistence that her story was true. I \\*AM\\* worried that the child's mother keeps making excuses for her daughter stealing, refusing to return stolen items, and even calling her niece horrible names for returning the stolen property.\n\n(edited: I wouldn't worry too much \\*\\*about the child\\*\\*)", "It's actually the age at which this starts happening.", "It's actually very developmentally appropriate for a child this age to be learning to lie. If they don't, it can be a thing you need to keep an eye on. Her mother is likely just very gullible.", "Exactly - they've got a bonafide bratzilla there.", "Scary, can you imagine the kiddo as a teen? Yikes, squared.", "Too late, look at her role model.", "I swear to you, if f somebody stole my favourite plushie, there'd be blood.", "As a mom of a four year old I call bullshit. Object permanence is learned when the kid is not even 1 year old. And yes this 4 year old is a budding klepto if she is not taught better, and momnnow condones it. Yes young kids take stuff. They might even lie about it. But that's the moment to teach about appropriate behavior and consequences. Not the moment to scream about your poor precious little darling.", "It sounded like her mum was getting involved and was going to be on her side but before that could play out she snatched a toy off a 4 year old.", "Perhaps. Maybe she was inconsolable because she didn't get her own way. OP's aunt's reaction suggests the cousin might not be used to consequences and if so, she and OP's uncle are failing this kid.", "Right, starts. But IME they usually suck pretty badly (or at least the parents can tell they are lying pretty easily based on their tell). To have a consistent story that sticks over a couple of weeks (when she told mom where she got it and again when OP\u2019s mom asked) with at least 2 weeks in between is pretty skilled for a 4 yo. (Again, IME)", "Valid", "And what was mom going to do? Do you think, with how stubborn the aunt was being even after having been shown undeniable proof that the toy belonged to OP's roommate, that mom was going to magically talk the aunt into giving up the toy?", "Probably! Regardless, I don't think it's about this specific toy...", "Any number of things. Shamed her? made her see reason? approach the situation without being emotional and attacking? \n\nLol downvoted for suggesting talking through a problem and not escalating and then blocking contact with everyone. Never change AITA.", ">Shamed her? made her see reason?\n\nAre you for real? How is mom going to say anything more reasonable than OP showing proof it was her roommate's stuffed animal? At that point, the aunt had *no* logical argument and any normal person would have gone \"oh, okay, I see that this is clearly your roommate's stuffed animal. Alright daughter, time to hand it over, it's not yours. It's not good to steal other ppl's things.\"\n\nBut she didn't do that. She still stuck with the preachool story. That should be an obvious clue that there *is no* reasoning with her. You can't make someone see reason when they simply refuse to acknowledge it. And how is mom supposed to shame aunt when she lets her daughter keep a stuffed toy she *knows* isn't hers?\n\n>suggesting talking through a problem and not escalating\n\nThat's literally what happened though? OP let aunt know the stuffed animal belonged to someone else and even went through the effort of showing the aunt proof. That *was* talking through the problem. Sucks that it had to be escalated bc the aunt clearly didn't care, but she brought that on herself and now her daughter had to get upset bc she couldn't act like a grown up and admit her child did something wrong.", "We know the words that OP said that she said. Not the tone, not the body language.", "Why does that matter? I don't see a problem unless OP was screaming or yelling."]}
