Alex and I have been friends since 5th grade and we are now roommates as Alex moved back to our hometown for a job.  She\u2019s set to move into her own apartment in January but shes been with me since October.\n\nI own a small house with 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, so Alex gets her privacy and I have mine.  We\u2019ve had no issues.\n\nI hosted Thanksgiving this year with my mom, my brother Matt, my aunt, uncle, and little cousin Susie (4f).  Everything went fine\u2026Alex went to her mom\u2019s house, so she wasn\u2019t there.\n\nBut Alex noticed one of her stuffed animals, a dinosaur I\u2019ll call Lucy, was missing.  Alex loves stuffed animals and Lucy and another stuffed animals were her favorite.  They are what she told me her \u201csensory items\u201d (Alex is on the autism spectrum, high functioning, diagnosed 2 years ago).  My family doesn\u2019t know Alex is autistic as I swore to keep it a secret.  She doesn\u2019t want anyone to know.  But I helped her look for Lucy for over a week and we couldn\u2019t find her.  Alex has been depressed and crying over this since Thanksgiving.\n\nI went to my mom\u2019s house on Saturday and my aunt and Susie were there.  Susie was sitting at the table holding Lucy.  I wasn\u2019t super sure so I took a photo of everyone, and sent it to Alex and she confirmed it was Lucy.\n\nI told my aunt that Lucy belonged to my roommate and went to take it.  Susie snatched it back and yelled at me and my aunt asked what I was doing.  I told her I was taking back Lucy, that this toy wasn\u2019t Susie\u2019s.  My aunt insisted it came from Susie\u2019s preschool since that\u2019s what she told her, but I showed her the message Alex sent me confirming this was indeed Lucy.\n\nI reached for it and my aunt pushed my hand away.  My mom asked us both to stop and asked Susie where she got the toy.  Susie insisted she found it her preschool but I knew she was lying.\n\nI texted Alex and asked for a photo of  Lucy and she sent me one of her from high school or college holding Lucy.  It had the same bleach stain on its side, so my mom sided with me and said Susie needed to give it back.  My aunt called me and Alex ridiculous, and that Susie is too attached to it, and still swore it was from her preschool.  Susie said the same thing.\n\nSo, not my proudest moment, but I snatched Lucy and left.  Yes, Susie was screaming.  But I brought Lucy back to Alex.\n\nAlex is grateful I found Lucy and brought her back and has been walking around with her since.  But my aunt called me a heartless cow for \u201ctraumatizing\u201d her daughter.  My uncle hasn\u2019t said anything as far as I know, but Matt knows and says I could\u2019ve handled it better since I was arguing with a 4 year old but said I ultimately did the right thing.  My mom agrees with Matt and said Susie was inconsolable when I left but it should\u2019ve been returned to Alex regardless.\n\nI know Lucy belongs to Alex but now I feel bad snatching a toy from a 4 year old the way I did knowing how attached she was to it and possibly scarring her.

Her understanding of truth and lies, and even her memory of where she got the toy, are very under-developed. But that's why the whims of a four-year old can't dictate adult actions.\n\nIdeally, you would have been able to handle this differently. Snatching the toy from a 4-year old isn't ideal. Explaining why it is clear that she's mistaken about where it came from, assuring her that she is not in trouble for her mistake, reminding her of how much she loves her toys and why it is not right to take the toys that other people love, and offering to help her find a similar toy of her own that she can love would all have been good.\n\nBut it was her own mom who made that impossible by backing her up and opposing you and trying to stop you", "NTA- Both you and Susie's mom could've handled it better, but ultimately you were in the right. \n\nHonestly, I would've stolen it back when she wasn't present or paying attention like she did to your friend.\n\nMom gets an easy out saying it just got lost, you got your toy back, you don't need to add to the little goblin's future trauma of being an entitled little kid whose mom covers for.

Her mom is trying to turn her into an entitled monster no one can tolerate. Why someone would do that to their own kid is beyond me. But you mitigated the damage to that child a little bit.", "NTA - you didn't argue with a 4 year old, you argued with the mother of a 4 year old - who appears to have the same emotional intelligence as her daughter.\n\nKudos' to you for having your roommates back!", "This would have been the perfect opportunity for your Aunt and little Susie how bad stealing is. Smh. NTA", "NTA. Stealing is wrong, your niece learned a valuable lesson, your aunt is a fool and a bad parent, and your roommate is lucky to have you", "I'm not a child psychologist so f\\*\\*\\* me, but the kid will probably forget about the animal in a week. She won't forget so easily that you took something violently away from her and will probably hate you for a while or maybe even a long while; specially if her mother keeps feeding her hatred towards you, which i'm sure she will.  \nThat said: you're NTA for taking it back no matter what and i'm sure Alex will always remember it. But, as you said, you could've handled it better. Maybe not say she has autism, but that it has extreme sentimental value or something like that.

You did what you had to do because your aunt wouldn't.", "NTA\n\nShe learned a lesson that day regardless that she can't take things that belong to others. As long as that feeling gets reinforced next time it'll stick. \n\nIf you really feel bad about it then you could ask Alex where she got it and then as a Christmas gift give her one then. You could also just tell your aunt hey this is where it is from", "NTA. And thank you for both being a good friend, and letting Susie know she cannot get away with lying.", "NTA- don't feel bad. Your aunt should feel bad for not teaching her child not to steal or lie.", "NTA. The child wasn\u2019t telling the truth and she\u2019s probably spoiled, 4 or no 4.", "NTA", "NTA... Susie is a thief and a liar and her mother is an enabling AH. I'd have nothing to do with them in the future. \nIs this the new norm? Protect kids from the consequences of their wrongs? Is there any other way yo see this?\n\nEDIT: ok so Susie is 4 so I will giver her a break but Mom is still an AH. Her response should have been to teach her child not to lie or steal. Apologize and make amends to your roommate", "NTA. Um, she\u2019s 4. Trust me, she is NOT traumatized. She probably cried for a few minutes and then got distracted by the next shiny thing. If she\u2019s still upset it\u2019s only cause aunt keeps pushing 4 year old\u2019s buttons and keeping the \u201ctrauma\u201d alive.", "NTA, text your aunt and tell her that she needs to be a better parent and teach her child not to be a thief, that is a crime and she is not entitled to other people's belongings just because she wants them!", "NTA The aunt is for not dealing with the situation appropriately.", "NTA also feel bad for the 4-year-old who will most likely end up growing up a brat", "I am a bit baffled by the lying by Susie and your aunt. Thanksgiving was part of what was likely a 4-day weekend in this situation (I doubt preschool was open on the Friday). And it\u2019s also very hard for me to believe that Susie was able to sneak in that dinosaur for the ride home on Thanksgiving without her parents seeing it at some point that night before or after they got home. And then keeping up the pretence once confronted with picture evidence that it was not hers.\n\nNTA. And given the entitlement and deception here, I don\u2019t think what you did was wrong. If you had let Susie take it home with her that day, chances are very likely that they would have conveniently taken Lucy \u201cback\u201d to preschool, never to be found again. Even if you didn\u2019t teach Susie a life lesson, they are definitely on guard never to steal from you again. Which is a silver lining.", "NTA it is unbelievable that your aunt is raising a liar and a thief and has the audacity to criticize you for it after you shared your home with them for the holidays. There was hard evidence supporting your case and it was your responsibility to give it back to the rightful owner.", "NTA the toy was stolen. You did the right thing.", "NTA -  Gees I wonder where that bad behaviour was learnt...your Aunt needs to grow some morals & teach Susie before it's too late!", "NTA. Your aunt is raising a thief.", "NTA\n\nSusie's 4, she'll get over it. The toy didn't belong to her and your aunt is TA for refusing to give it back. Snatching the toy wasn't the ideal solution, obviously, but taking it back was the right thing to do.\n\nReal quick though, \"high functioning\" isn't an acceptable term in dialogue about autism any more. No hate, just letting you know. \"High\" and \"low\" functioning are descriptors that basically indicate how well a person can pretend to not be autistic, and they're in no way helpful to autistic people.", "NTA. Loads of fair and just things upset 4 year olds. Stealing is wrong. You yanking it away was perhaps awkward but seemed necessary since your aunt was t adulting. \n\nYour poor roommate was in great distress and you were a good friend. I mean this in the kindest way possible but crying for weeks over a stuffed animal is a lot. There will be some more devastating life events than this and it may help.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t arguing with a 4 year old but the 4 year old\u2019s adult parent. Good for you for snatching it back. There was no other way.", "Finally a story where some of the family members are good resonable people.", "NTA. Really small children are still developing a sense of empathy, and sometimes they struggle to understand things like how their actions may hurt others, etc. But they absolutely can learn, _provided empathy is modeled for them._ One expert on the development has put it this way: empathy is caught not taught.\n\nThat means that your cousin needs adults in her life who will show her by their own actions how to be considerate of others, why social rules like no stealing exist, etc. But I'm afraid it doesn't sound like her mother is modeling that for her, so here's hoping other adults will... Either way, allowing her to steal from your roommate doesn't actually do her any favors, even if it was upsetting to you to see her screaming.", "NTA. Your aunt is raising an entitled brat.", "NTA. Even faced with proof positive, your aunt was fine with her kid stealing. The kid needed to understand that taking things that weren't hers isn't acceptable. And she's four. She'll get over it.", "As the mother of a preschooler, we all know better than to pretend it's ok to keep ANYTHING that is \"found\" at school. Your aunt is living in lala land.", "NTA people on here talking about how OP could have been gentler, the gentle route would have been the aunt taking Lucy back or getting Susie to do it. Instead she carried on enabling even when faced with physical proof of it being Alex's.", "NTA. After providing proof and the mother wouldn't do the right thing, you had to take matters into your own hands. What's crazy is their cover story is still stealing. Finding it at preschool is still taking something that isn't yours. Either way, this parent is teaching theft.  \n\nAnd Susie will be inconsolable tomorrow when she's told she can't eat a battery for breakfast. She'll be fine.", "NTA. Susie's Mom have avoided the scene but decided it was okay to let her daughter steal.", "ESH- you invaded her personal space by taking something she had in her hand. I know it wasn\u2019t her\u2019s to begin with (and her 4 year old brain probably does too).  A gentler touch could have gotten her to relinquish the toy if she had a way to save face. Sharing that Alex was crying and missed Lucy May have helped, but your heavy hand forced her to double down with her story of where she got it. Embarrassing her and forcing her to defend herself is not a good look for an adult. \n\nYou could (if you can rationally detach from this) buy her something similar and offer it as apology for taking Lucy from her hands and explaining that that was wrong, but so was her  taking Lucy from her home with Alex without permission. \n\n4 year olds struggle with character development and reasoning skills. Muscling things from them is easier for adults than taking the time to teach them. I suspect your family will be quite upset with you for a while. Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?", "Yeah OP wasn't arguing with a 4 year old, she was arguing with a fully grown adult who honestly didn't care that her child stole and lied about it.", "Her mom was never going to make her give it up- and she stole it.  And she KNEW she stole it.  I knew when I took candy from the self serve bins at the grocery store it was wrong, when I was 4.  And when I got caught, my mom lit into me- and rightfully so!! Susie's mom is teaching her that stealing and lying and throwing a fit is how to get what she wants.  Susie needed to be taught that while she might like something, she is not entitled to it- and you taught her that.  NONE of the other info about roomate being on the spectrum, etc is even relevant.  The kiddo took something she knew did not belong to her, lied about it (because she knew it was wrong), and mom backed her up despite EVIDENCE she was lying.  What were you supposed to do?  Negotiate for 3 hr before doing exactly this, because this was the only way to get that stuffy back to its owner that mommy dearest was ever going to let happen. NTA", "Kids feed off their parent's reactions.\n\nSusie's mother could have handled it in a better way by setting a better tone. Something like, \"I bet Alex misses Lucy just like you miss Mr Bear when we can't find him.  You found Lucy and were nice to keep her safe until we found out who her owner is, so let's send her home with a big hug and a kiss, OK?\"", "As an early childhood educator I can attest to this. Most toys and materials are either donations or are paid for by severely underpaid preschool teachers and educators.\n\nThe fact this mother is teaching her kid that it's okay to steal toys from school is seriously fricked up. You didn't scar the kid. 4 is absolutely old enough to know not to steal, hence that fact that she chose to lie in the 1st place. This could have been a great teaching opportunity but your aunt sucks.", "Funny how the Aunt\u2019s justification was \u201cMy kid didn\u2019t steal this from your friend, they stole it from a classmate at preschool.\u201d People just don\u2019t realize what they say sometimes.", "This.  OP wouldn't have HAD to snatch the toy from 4 y.o. Susie if Susie's hopelessly entitled mother had actually parented her.  Place the blame where it belongs.", "The aunt should've taught her that she can't take things that don't belong to her. Aunt probably didn't want to deal with the screaming. She got it anyway.", "Aunt didn\u2019t want to admit she has a little thief that she needs to have a conversation with about other people belongings vs her belongings and the truth is important even when it will cause us disappointment", "Yeah, I was really wondering about how awkward and abrupt this sounded.  This should have been an extremely manageable situation.   \n\nIt\u2019s just not that hard to get a toy from a 4 year old, there are many options that are less ridiculous and less likely to rip the toy. \n\nThey also could have saved the roommate days of tears by asking guests.", "You're right. The fact she had to go that route because the mom wouldn't parent is absolutely ridiculous. NTA.", "I\u2019m perfectly happy and right. I\u2019m not buying something to appease a 4 year old thief to get back an item that wasn\u2019t hers to begin with.  That\u2019s how you raise entitled brats.", "The 4yr old won't learn this if the mum isn't teaching her though.", "NTA. Ask your sister to email the preschool teacher and show you proof. She is lying.", "Aww, hon if you were happy, you wouldn\u2019t have posted here asking if your TAH. You\u2019re still very angry at a human who\u2019s prefrontal cortex isn\u2019t developed yet and violated your trust. Give yourself time. You\u2019re personal space was invaded as well. Having someone steal from your house is a violation and does created a lot of anger. It will dissipate with time and you can decide how you want to move forward. You don\u2019t have to buy her anything. Maybe a stern talking to so she realizes it wasn\u2019t right to 1) take something that wasn\u2019t hers and 2) lie to cover it up.", "Yes, a lying child that deserved to get called out. She shouldn't get to benefit from her stealing and lies. Being upset is the consequences for her actions. She just learned a valuable lesson. You wouldn't have gotten it back without snatching it. If the mother got her hands on it,bthe would have left and you would never see Lucy again. You did what you had to do. Maybe she'll think twice next time she wants to steal.", "Kids will push boundaries- and at 4, they KNOW if they are lying and stealing (I have read many child development/developmental neuro papers that support this, but not my field).  And yes, it is not out of the ordinary- but that is why parenting means showing them where the line is when they cross it. Its ok for a 4 yr old to get super upset when they are showed that line- but not the OP's problem.  That mom has apparently never set a boundary with kiddo is the problem.", "Look, don't doubt yourself, you're NTA. I can tell you straight up, as a mother of 3, that I've become totally immune to the tantrums of children and would have hurt this kid's feelings in a very thorough way, that you definitely did not. You're better than me and continue to live without shame in that solace lol.", "A normally developed 4 year old is very much not a baby, and has a very good understanding of property. A lack of such understanding is common in 2 year olds, but there's massive development between 2 and 4.\n\nThis behavior by a 4 years old implies circumstances or people taught the 4 year old that stealing then lying about it works.", "Exactly. Four years olds are old enough to know that if something isn\u2019t there\u2019s, they shouldn\u2019t take it. Esp since she doesn\u2019t seem to have any remorse. \n\nI took stuff from my sister at that age and still feel bad for it, and I\u2019m an adult. \n\nI HATE the saying \u201c(child) is only (age)\u201d. It was used in favor of my youngest cousin who was, at that time, a total brat. He\u2019d hit others and his parents would say \u201che\u2019s only four\u201d and I\u2019d always want to yell back at them \u201cWELL PARENT HIM THEN\u201d.", "My son does the same thing and it\u2019s the same way here", "Facts are facts. The way you say things matters. \nJust because something is a fact doesn\u2019t justify bad behaviour.
