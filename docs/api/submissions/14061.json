My husband and I tried helping guide them through their feelings, like asking them about the diverse athletes they liked.\n\nGianna was hanging out with friends at the mall that night, some of whom were doing dress shopping for the upcoming dance.\n\nOur son and the boys decided to use this as an opportunity to trash the dress, using mud, drinks and cutting a few holes in the dress. We found out when Gianna came home, entered her room and saw the dress.\n\nThe boys were laughing and Ryker said they did it because Gianna didn\u2019t deserve to go to the banquet, and saying how there \u201ccould be kids that look like\u201d his Honduan friend.\n\nWe told Ryker we were trying our best to educate her in a very white town (we\u2019re also white). We told him that this was the wrong way to take out his anger and that as a result, he couldn\u2019t go to his 7th grade dance. Ryker told us to shut up and spent the rest of his night in his room with the boys.\n\nRyker texted my parents and siblings as well as my in-laws, a few have called us and came to his defense, saying he\u2019s just a kid who was trying to cope with anger.

I don\u2019t understand how destroying a dress is coming with a bigger punishment than getting in trouble for racism\u2026 twice. What he did was wrong, but the fact that your daughter is still getting to go to her dance and out with friends also seems like the wrong response. I can understand why he is angry.", "Slight YTA,  his punishment does seem more severe than hers given that she is a repeat offender and he is reacting to racism in his own home. Why is she still allowed to go to her dance given her behavior? You're educating her without any serious consequences but you're punishing him without any real education.", "So the racist doesn\u2019t actually get consequences? Clearly we know where she may have learned her bigotry. Do better and punish your daughter.\n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nYou're educating Gianna for repeated shitty behavior but not punishing her.

YTA. You're about to fail as parents.", "YTA. While you mention some ways in which you're trying to address Gianna's unacceptable behaviour, they're not exactly punishing. Gianna had to say sorry and write a letter? Please. She still gets a nice dress, and gets to go to some banquet. Meanwhile, your son is getting a more severe punishment for trashing the dress of his racist sister than she is getting for being racist.", "YTA- your clearly not teaching her to not be racist if she got in trouble AGAIN. Writing an essay isn\u2019t going to teach her anything. She did it to avoid further punishment. \nBut why is your daughter still attending a dance when her actions are vile?\nYour son was absolutely in the wrong to ruin the dress, but I absolutely understand why he is angry.", "YTA\nyour son is just a kid and clearly frustrated with your daughter behavior, although he shouldn't have ruin the dress why was your daughter going to the dance thing anyway? it's like you keep awarding her for her actions while your son is upset and ended up acting up on his feelings.", "YTA. An appropriate punishment would be making him pay back the cost of the dress/a new one. But I honestly wouldnt punish him, I'd explain how he did it was wrong but youre proud of him for sticking up for his friends against his RACIAT SISTER.

Maybe take a look at yourself and how you contributed to raising a racist.", "I don't know if you're AH, but you definitelly need to recalibrate the consequences you dish out to your kids.\n\nYour son trashed valued property of another person. He definitelly deserves punishment and forbidding him from going to the dance may be it.\n\nBut by her racist behavior your daughter trashed dignity of another human being. That's magnitudes worse than destroying even the most valuable thing. And for that she got a writing assignment and a cultural exchange dinner, which she obviously didn't give a crap about and learned nothing from. And during which she clearly disrespected your guests and seemingly got no punishment for that.\n\nIf your son can't go to the dance, then she needs even more severe punishment than that.\n\nEDIT: thanks for my first award, kind person!", "INFO: why was your daughter allowed to attend the dance?", "Look, you have to punish Gianna not just educate her, yes it's good that you are trying to teach her a lesson but you see she keeps repeating it, so start punishing her. As for rykard, what to say, since you took the 'education' path, then start it on rykard too. What he did to the dress is wrong.", "YTA for lack of a real punishment with real consequences for your daughter. \n\nKids need to feel the consequences of their actions. Showing racism is a huge deal and shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. It sounds like her phone wasn\u2019t taken away for very long and then she was able to go to the mall to go dress shopping with her friends. \n\nBoth kids need to be disciplined for their behaviors.

YTA.", "YTA.\n\nSo your son stands up against racism in his own home and is punished harshly, but your daughter makes the racist \"jokes\" as a repeat offender and still gets to go to the dance?\n\nBeyond that, she has an opportunity to learn about another culture through some amazing homemade cuisine and lighthearted conversation, and she can't even be bothered to *try* and be a gracious hostess?\n\nOP I can't help but note that you keep referring to Ryker's actions as \"his anger\", as if you think he doesn't have the right to be upset about his older sister and role model being so outrightly nasty about other races. He *is* angry, and rightfully so. I'd venture to say he may even feel somewhat betrayed that someone he loves and respects (i.e. his older sister) is being so rude and disgraceful.\n\nYeah you should punish your son for wrecking the dress but there's a way bigger issue here.", "ESH.\nRyker for destroying property. He should pay you parents the replacement cost (IMO).\n\nGianna for being a racist.\n\nAnd you and your spouse for not punishing Gianna. I understand you are trying to educate her, but for this type of ongoing issue, she needs education *and* consequences. She doesn't need to go to that dance until she can show changed behavior.\n\nYou can't punish one child harshly for a single act, and not impose consequences for a pattern of antisocial behavior.", "ESH, they both shouldn\u2019t be allowed to their respective dances, but you need to explain why to them. She\u2019s repeatedly engaged in racist behaviour while he lashed out in anger to get his way (however justified he was). Allowing either of them to go sets a poor precedent imo", "ESH\n\nWhy does your son get big consequences for his bad behavior, and your daughter have none?\n\nYour \"punishment\" of your daughter (an apology and a two-page essay?) obviously didn't work as she engaged in the same behavior *immediately* thereafter. You didn't say how long she lost her phone for, but if it was merely to \"investigate\" it doesn't sound like very long.\n\nShe's making racist \"jokes\" to the extent that she's *getting in trouble for it at school*\u2014and she still gets to go to her dance?\n\nI'm not surprised your son is angry and lashed out. He sees his sister repeatedly insulting his friends, and nobody does anything about it.", "Hang on a minute \n\nSo she\u2019s racist .. on more than one occasion.. and your way to handle that is to educate \n\nBut he retaliates to her racist ass and your way to handle that is to punish him .. in quite a severe way .. removing something that meant a lot to him ? \n\nYou go ahead with this (assuming the dance hasn\u2019t already happened ) and I can guarantee you\u2019ve just created a core memory for this kid that won\u2019t be forgotten nor forgiven \n\nIt\u2019s your daughter you need to be focusing on tbh", "YTA. Your son gets punished for taking a stand against racism & a fairly deserved prank & your racist daughter gets to do whatever? \n\nBro, you are fucking up. Your daughter needs all privileges at the very least restricted until she can act like a fucking human being & your son deserves a trip to the ice cream parlor. If you do not make this right you may lose your son forever & doom your daughter to a life as an entitled trumper. \n\nDo better.", "YTA\n\nAnd all of your kids are too. The fact that your son thought it was okay to trash his sister's dress is bad, very very bad. He stuck up for his friend which is great but that's not the way to do it. He at least owes you the cost of the dress. The fact that your daughters are racist brat is, well, I could say a lot but I'll just say that this is one of the worst traits anybody could ever have. All of this still makes you the AH.\n\nNo one should be going to any dance. That should have been taken away from her the minute you found out she was being racist again. Also the fact that she's done this twice shows me that whatever you did the first time obviously wasn't a real punishment. You need to take this very seriously with both children.", "Your actions indicate you are more upset by the destruction of property than a moral bankruptcy/actual malice in character.  YTA.  \n\nActions speak louder than words and you are punishing the act against *stuff* far more severely than the DOUBLE act against petiole, from someone who is older and who has already been through your re-education attempt.  You might want to consider why and what your have going on underneath the hood, too.", "ESH \n\nHe and his friends were wrong to destroz the dress. \n\nYou were wrong in not punishing your daughter more harshly for the racism\n\nYou daughter obviously was wrong by being racist\n\n\nSo overall no one should go to any dances and you should really start educating your daughter some more on the topic and maybe figuring out where she gets the racism from. Friends, other family members, internet etc. And try to act against those factors that corrupt her.", "YTA - So your daughter makes racist remarks TWICE (that you know of) and she still gets to o to the dance...  But your son doesn't for doing something way less worse? \n\nLook, both your kids are behaving badly.  But in my mind, racist remarks are way worse than destroyed property.  And at least your son was coming from a good place even if his actions were very misguided.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter is a little racist monster. I feel sorry for your son that you clearly favour your daughter and apparently support her racism. Just because you live in a \u201cwhite town\u201d is no damn excuse. Punish her properly and apologise to your son.", "Something about the consequences for these kids isnt going right. The daughter has not changed her behaviour whatsoever, the son apparently thinks its oke to destroy other peoples property. And why on earth are both kids hanging out with their friends? I would have at least called the parents of the sons friends to come pick them up or drive then home. Not hang out all night. Makes me wonder if you even talked to the parents of what these kids did", "YTA\n\nRacism is worse than ruining a dress. \n\nKeep your racist daughter home from her dance, let your justifiably pissed off son go to his, and use the money you would have spent on a new dress to buy a gift basket for your son\u2019s friend\u2019s family for putting up with you and your awful daughter.", "YTA.\n\nYour response to the first instance of racist behaviour wasn't too bad. The second time, however, it doesn't sound like there were any meaningful consequences. This is a very serious problem that needs to be dealt with, and you aren't doing anything.\n\nAs for your son, it's not a terribly mature way to handle conflict, but given his age, it's not surprising. Should there be some consequences for him? Possibly, but I'd argue not. Sure he destroyed property, but he didn't do anything unethical. It's similar to how acts of civil disobedience can be illegal, yet completely ethical. He saw that there was a serious problem that wasn't being addressed, and took action. It might lead to problems down the line, so at a minimum a conversation is necessary. That said, he has a good moral compass. Injustices persist when good people stand by and do nothing.\n\nI'm appalled that you seem to think destruction of property is worse than racism. He did it in service of a much larger goal. She's being malicious and needs to be prevented from causing more harm, before the patterns of behaviour become more ingrained. \n\nOf everyone involved in this situation, he's by far the most moral.", "You say you are \"investigating\" where your daughter's racism comes from. Have you looked in the mirror? Bias usually starts at home, whether it's overtly stated or not.", "YTA. Ryker deserves a high five. He is 100% correct that nasty little racists don't deserve to do fun things. And sorry, but your daughter is a nasty little racist and you need to figure out where this is coming from and who she is hanging out with. If I found out my child was being repeatedly racist or bigoted otherwise their entire fucking life would be having an overhaul.", "Why was she allowed to go to the mall with her BF and friends ?", "So... you don't punish the daughter who repeatedly gets called out for racist behavior... but you DO punish the son who (admittedly, in a half-assed way) attempts to defend his friend.\n\nYTA", "Info: why is your son immediately punished for one offence and your daughter barely punished at all for more than one offence?", "YTA, its deeply fucked up that his punishment for being angry about racism the wrong way is worse than her punishment for being racist.", "YTA.

I would even go as far as to say you are racist because why are you punishing the victim of racism yet you are praising the racist.", "YTA\n\n\nYou punish him more severely that the daughter who has gotten in trouble for being racist multiple times, shame on you", "YTA. Daughter is racist: apologize and take her phone away, no bigger punishment\nSon trashes a dress because of his racist sister: not going to his dance.

YTA, was what Ryker did acceptable? No of course not, he\u2019s also a 13 year old kid who watched his older sister make racist jokes about the culture of a close friend of his. Why did you just take away your daughter\u2019s phone after she and her friends REPEATEDLY made racist jokes, but when your son acts out you say he can\u2019t go to the dance?\nEither punish them both, or punish neither.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter shouldn't be allowed to go to her dance. Why are you punishing Ryker for acting out against Gianna blatant racism? \nClearly what you're doing to punish her is not enough", "The child who deserves punishment is your daughter.

You get to choose punishment.  In the future, tell Ryker to stay in his lane, and his sister' education is not his business.  YOu should not have put her in position of being \"educated\" by a sibling.", "NTA.

Just like your daughter, your son needs to know there are consequences to his actions. Sounds like good parenting all the way around to me.", "NTA, but this is a complicated situation. Your son did the wrong thing for the right reason. He should be punished for ruining the dress but lauded for standing up for his friend. I'm torn on denying him the dance. Maybe he pays you for the dress? You would be a major asshole if you let your daughter go to the dance, and especially if you let her go and not your son. She needs to be taught that racial jokes can have consequences.", "NTA for not allowing him to go to the dance because he ruined a dressed that was paid for and will probably be replaced anyways by more hard earned money. Your son could've went about the justice another way and now he has to learn that the path to hell is paid with good intentions.\n\nHowever, it sounds like you have another issue. You tried to get your daughter to stop making racist statements on two occasions and they failed. After this incident I'm sure her beliefs will only be intensified and cause a bigger rift between your kids.", "ESH - I think taking away the dance from either of your kids is pretty harsh punishment.  That is their childhood, their memories, you can't give that back to them... you really want your kids being isolated as every other kid talks and reminisces about \"the dance and everything that happened there\"?\n\nIt would be more appropriate to punish them in other ways.\n\nYou also can't just expect your racist daughter to flip from a single scolding and writing an apology.  It appears your very \"white\" town has racists in it, and are influencing your daughter.  If she's already acting this way then other people got to her before good parenting did.\n\nYou have an uphill battle here, that's why strong values are important to instill in your kids at their most impressionable young ages, now she's formed her own opinion and you have a lot of work cut out for you if you want to fix that.", "NAH.

This behavior doesn\u2019t happen overnight.", "NTA.\n\nSadly, kids have learned from immature adults' behaviour that the way to deal with others making mistakes is not through conversation or education, but through aggression, violence, cancellation, humilliation, public shaming, etc. They see this kind of aggression as justified for a greater good.\n\nThat is extremely dangerous behaviour and you're doing great by not letting this slide. Also, your son's reaction shows some absurd levels of entitlement and manipulation (try to pin others against you and playing victim). He also gets to tell you to shut up and hang out with his friends, and makes you question your decision.\n\nNo bueno.\n\nAnd your daughter... she needs to learn a few things. My questions here are: was she instigating the racist jokes and comments? Was someone else in her group doing it and she was just tagging along to be in their good grace? Are these racist jokes and comments severe ans brutal? Are they just silly comments? Spewing awful malicious racist insults is not the same as saying something silly (i don't know, like singing \"la cucaracha\" and laughing) that could be considered racist.\n\nIntent is very important. Your son acted from malicious intent when he destroyed his sister's dress. What's your daughter's intent? Is it malicious? Is it just ignorant? Is she just trying to fit in with her group of friends? What about her friends?\n\nThis is more complex and nuanced than bad evil racist daughter, good righteous virtuous son.", "NTA at all.

It isn't his job to parent his older sister. You already were working through Gianna's bad behavior and the potential causes. I'm sure Ryker felt like he was standing up for what he knows is right but vandalizing someone else's things isn't the answer, and he deserves to face a punishment for that. Even when someone has had bad behavior, going into their personal space and demolishing a private possession is a form of bullying - Ryker was very misguided and became the thing he thought he was above.\n\nI am wondering about the dynamic between them. I noticed for instance that he wanted to 'teach' his older sister about Honduran culture. YES, natural and organic exposure to different types of people is one of the best ways to combat bias and racism but it makes me wonder if it has created an odd power dynamic between them, where he feels like it is his role to correct her behavior.", "NTA Stick to your guns. If you let Ryker get away with this his behavior will just escalate.", "NTA. Your son destroyed something you spent money on and then told you to shut up. My parents would have grounded me for a month", "Nta\u2026 and I don\u2019t understand how allowing one child to bully another\u2014not to mention destroying her clothes\u2014would be appropriate. Oh, wait: I get it now. His bullying and violence is ok because you agree with his motive. \n\nWhat happens if he acts out aggression over something you disagree about? Or they act out against people, not property?\n\nI happen to agree with the need for tolerance and expectation, and may have prevented her from going to the prom (and returned the dress), but a failure to discipline in one case is never an excuse to excuse equally bad behavior. \n\nWorst of all, Ryker and his friend have now given Gianna\u2019s bigotry\u2014which may well have been just a peer-pressure thing she could be weaned from\u2014concrete grievances and resentment.", "NAH (because by rules of the thread, if NTA then somebody has to be).\nInfo: did you get your daughter a new dress? Do the kids get any allowance?\nIf yes, I'd propose he still goes to the dance (big event with friends) but has to pay for some amount of the new dress / repairs and maybe extra chores that are normally his sister's?\nBut really sounds like y'all are good parents trying to be fair and guiding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly...\n\n>You are exactly right\nin your call for negotiation. Indeed, this is the purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and\nestablish such creative tension that a community that has consistently refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks\nso to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored...\n\n>My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and\nnonviolent pressure. History is the long and tragic story of the fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges\nvoluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has\nreminded us, groups are more immoral than individuals.\n\n>We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the\noppressed. Frankly, I have never yet engaged in a direct-action movement that was \"well timed\" according to the timetable of\nthose who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \"wait.\"...\n\n>An unjust law is a code that a majority inflicts on a minority that\nis not binding on itself. This is difference made legal. On the other hand, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to\nfollow, and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal...\n\n>We can never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was \"legal\" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in\nHungary was \"illegal.\" It was \"illegal\" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany. But I am sure that if I had lived in Germany\nduring that time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers even though it was illegal...\n\n>Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The urge for freedom will eventually come...\n\n>But as I continued to think about the matter, I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being considered an extremist. Was not\nJesus an extremist in love? -- \"Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.\" Was not\nAmos an extremist for justice? -- \"Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\" Was not Paul an\nextremist for the gospel of Jesus Christ? -- \"I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.\" Was not Martin Luther an extremist?\n-- \"Here I stand; I can do no other so help me God.\" Was not John Bunyan an extremist? -- \"I will stay in jail to the end of my\ndays before I make a mockery of my conscience.\" Was not Abraham Lincoln an extremist? -- \"This nation cannot survive half\nslave and half free.\" Was not Thomas Jefferson an extremist? -- \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created\nequal.\" So the question is not whether we will be extremist, but what kind of extremists we will be...\n\n>The contemporary church is so often a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound.

I asked him why he\u2019d never told me and he told me because he knew I\u2019d blow a gasket and probably end up suspended defending him. He was right.
