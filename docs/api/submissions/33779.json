So to everyone saying I\u2019m not answering suspicious questions, I literally cant**\n\nI (26f) spent 22-26 of December with my bf\u2019s (\u201cLuke\u201d) family, staying at his parents\u2019 house along with his sister, her husband, and their kids. \n\nIt was a long few days to say the very least. It\u2019s very cramped quarters (3 bedrooms, 1 full bathroom), and very different to my own family\u2019s Christmas. Luke\u2019s family, his mother especially, are not my biggest fan (totally fair, as we\u2019re all very different), his niece and nephew are unruly, they eat food that I don\u2019t, all in all, not what I would call a good time. Nevertheless, I went to Christmas at Luke\u2019s request and tried my best to make sure I was not a burden or embarrassment to Luke while he tried to spend time with his family. \n\nToday, we left to go home, and tomorrow I will be going to see my mother for a few days before returning for New Year\u2019s, when Luke and I will be attending my friend\u2019s party. The party is a black tie event that Luke is not looking forward to as he doesn\u2019t know/like anyone going besides me.\n\nIn the car on the way home, he joked that he really wasn\u2019t looking forward to going. I joked back that I made a sacrifice going to his family for Christmas, so now it was his turn, and at least the party was only a few hours. Luke got offended that I said seeing his family was a sacrifice and asked if I really meant that. I said yes, I did, obviously I did, since I pretty much subsisted on coffee for 3 days, his niece ruined a piece of my personalised luggage set, and his family clearly don\u2019t like me. I said I was happy to go for him, and I would do it again, but it wasn\u2019t enjoyable for me beyond seeing him happy.\n\nThis was apparently deeply offensive as he said he felt like he\u2019d had a nice family Christmas and that I\u2019d ruined the memories now that he knew I was pretending the whole time. I\u2019m a bit confused as to how he would think I legitimately enjoyed being cold, hungry, and having no privacy for days on end, and not being with my family for Christmas. But either way, it was a choice I was happy to make for him and it\u2019s not the end of the world.\n\nI don\u2019t see how I\u2019m the AH for pointing out (humorously and with no malice) that I made a sacrifice for Luke, but he\u2019s been cold to me since I said it. Am I missing something here?\n\nEdit: It won\u2019t let me comment since this is a new account (don\u2019t have the karma) so for everyone asking about the food/why I mostly had coffee, I didn\u2019t want to seem like a jerk for buying and cooking my own food while there. Luke and I went to the store and I get a few snacks that I didn\u2019t need to keep in the kitchen so as not to offend his family but obviously I couldn\u2019t he eating those all the time. So at breakfast I had coffee, for lunch had another coffee/snack and for dinner I just ate what I could of whatever they were having (normally a bit of the side dishes). I thought it would come across really rude to buy and then use their kitchen to cook myself a whole separate meal.

That said, just the fact that you did not see your family for Christmas in order to visit his would automatically be considered a sacrifice by anyone. NTA", "NTA leaning to you're\n\nYou shouldn't have said that, not everybody is as outspoken as we are. The whole \"oh you ruined the memories\" act is not doing anything for me. The luggage is a cost of doing business. Why couldn't you mention that you could not eat any of the food? You did not subsist on coffee for 3 days.\n\nLuke could be terrible, I really don't know, but this seems like a failure of communication and the argument is that, as well.", "Some of this could have been something you communicated to your bf and have it be worked out. The food thing, that's something that you both can solve, that way after the trip is over you don't have to surprise him and say btw , i didn't eat for three days. That's not a compromise because its not something that he wants either. That's you being a martyr to avoid a communication.", "ESH.  You are not a match.\n\n1) Luke comes from a more modest family.  He enjoyed his family Christmas - cramped accommodations and all.  It sounds like you just don't like them and that they aren't your kind of people.\n\n2) You like black-tie event.  Luke does not.  \n\nYou all just like and want different things in life.", "NTA... not even a little bit.\n\nYou're obviously either a great actor or your BF is oblivious.  Either way, good on you for sticking it out!\n\nI HIGHLY recommend getting your own place when visiting people....particularly  inlaws.  As a general rule, I do not like staying with other people in their homes.  There are certain daily routines that just do not benefit from additional people in a space.", "NAH\n\nAnyone who has gone to their in-laws' for the holidays can relate. I know I can. I love my wife's family and we get along great. But it's another city. Actually it's the burbs of another city, so between that and the holidays, there isn't a whole lot to do. Not to mention that, as you say, staying in someone else's home can be uncomfortable. So I get it. Even my wife recognizes that it is a sacrifice. \n\nThere are a few reasons he doesn't understand. One possibility is that he has never made that sacrifice. Another is he was being a bit selfish and just refusing to relate. Hopefully it was not that. One more possibility is that you were more aggressive than you intended. I don't see any problem being frank about the fact that his family dislikes you because that discussion needs to happen. But comments like for example you \"subsisted on coffee\" might have been over the top depending on how you phrased them. Different cooking and cramped quarters are sacrifices to be sure, but it's to be expected. You're not staying at the Ritz.", "NTA, it's common sense you do for family. That includes SO even if your not feeling it. I go to Christmas with the inlaws every year and every year we get in the car and my wife thanks me for a great time. Not because I made Christmas happen or anything but because she knows I sacrificed what I want for what she wants. If I had my way I'd sit at home chilling for the holidays, she knows that and appreciates me going for her. It's obvious he was blind to the fact that it's a sacrifice for you, now he knows. I think it's always known just never really verbalized and when you verbalized it he had to acknowledge it. It may have even caused a bit of cognitive dissonance, realizing that they are not your family and you don't necessarily enjoy time with them.", "NTA\n\nIs this how you want to spend the rest of your life? Walking on eggshells while starving so that people who don't like you won't dislike you more? \n\nWho's choice is it for him to not go to your mother's with you? \n\n(I've seen the edit, so I'm not expecting answers. These are just things to think about.)", "INFO your edit didn\u2019t really clarify anything. Why couldn\u2019t you eat what his family cooked?  Do you have an allergy or intolerance?  Are you vegetarian or vegan? Idn there\u2019s a lot of people asking these questions and you chose not to answer. That\u2019s suspicious and I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s of a different culture and you just don\u2019t want to admit you didn\u2019t want to try a different culture\u2019s food..", "NTA. Your boyfriend seems very oblivious: \"I had such a great time, I didn't even notice that my girlfriend was uncomfortable, didn't eat a lot and was not treated very well by my family. But how could she ruin it all by pointing it out after I made clear that I will not enjoy going to her stupid New Years party!\"", "NTA. Listen, for years my partner's family weren't particularly fond of me; but they still went out of their way to make sure I had space, food I could eat, and were polite and pleasant to me over the holidays. It didn't make them (the holidays or the people) perfect of course; but my partner was well aware of the issues and helpful too.\n\nEta: clarified", "NAH.  Sometimes we put up with situations we absolutely are miserable in, let alone just uncomfortable in, for people we love.  You did that for Luke and, if it came across as you did in your post, you were pretty matter of fact about it.  Luke doesn't understand that he was comfortable and happy with his family in familiar circumstances.  You didn't really know the people well and the environment wasn't comfortable to you:  it doesn't have the same familiarity and memories to you.    That specific situation would have pushed my social skills for a day, let alone several days.\n\nAs for the food, I get you.  I have an extremely narrow range of what I like and remember being at my ex-husband's farm family for a long weekend while in the early stages of pregnancy and not being able to eat their food, both because I was pregnant and because I just hated it!  Like you, I went hungry for the weekend.  It's miserable.  And the heck with people who tell you you need to expand your tastes.  No, no you don't.  Usually the people saying that aren't willing to adapt to yours but judgmentally expect you to do all the adapting.  And, btw, his family hated me at the end of the weekend.\n\nHe should be willing to do the same for you at a party at your family.\n\nYou can have a easy-going conversation about it with Luke later where you can do some better communicating about it.  Expressing your discomfort right on top of his happy experience put a damper on it for him.  That's not to say you shouldn't have; it just possibly has something to do with his response.  His coldness is pretty immature, but in fact he's probably embarrassed as much as hurt.\n\nLuke appears to have some difficulty empathizing with you.  If he's otherwise empathetic, it's probably this uncomfortable experience and some immaturity on his part.  If he isn't, take this as a clear example of what you might be missing in his other behavior or in your relationship.  \n\nEssentially, I don't see this as an asshole issue, as I might with other Christmas nightmares.  You two seem good enough that this is just a relationship situation that needs to be communicated about with accommodations figured out so that it can be most comfortable for you both in the future.  Perhaps staying in a hotel or staying for a shorter time.  Relationships will sometimes hit a rough area and need to have it dealt with.  They aren't all deal breakers, although this might be one for either of you.  But you won't know without that conversation.  Hope next year is better.", "NTA, that was would be Luke, who didn't care or notice that you were not having a good time with his family.  You went to make him happy, he needs to realize that relationships aren't one sided where you bend over backwards for him and he doesn't want to go fir you.  He needs to suck it up or find someone whose self worth is all about him, his wants and needs not hers.", "INFO:\n\nYou said you spoke in the car home. If you had access to a car, why would the only thing you had for three days be coffee? I don't know how I'd be able to respect another adult if they couldn't problem-solve enough to:\n\n* Tell me that they were having trouble eating food\n* Go out to run errands and grabbing something to eat. Even a starbucks run could easily involve grabbing a sandwich\n* If both of these options somehow felt too embarassing (without context, I really can't imagine why), getting some granola bars to tide you over. \n\nUnless you've left out that you have a severe nut allergy they constantly ignored, what exactly did they serve that you couldn't eat and why would either your partner not know enough to speak up, or why would you choose to suffer silently? This just simply isn't a problem that should exist in an adult relationship, and I would personally not appreciate someone who chose to sit and sulk in silence for five days just to use it as ammunition on the way home.", "NTA your bf appears emotionally blind. Lot of folks are when it comes to their families, but its unreasonable of him to respond to you the way he currently is.", "His family may not like you because they are picking up on your obvious disdain for them. Criticizing their food and the accommodations they gave you. Grow up. You sound 16.", "OP - did you mention any of this to your bf? If he doesn\u2019t know, he won\u2019t know", "NTA.  Luke obviously thinks it was great to see his family. He's used to everything there. He did not see your POV. He's being thin skinned to not be able to understand you did not enjoy it as much as he did.  He can suck it up and go the party for a few hours.\n\nNext year (assuming you are still with Luke) and go to his family for Christmas, get a hotel room nearby and pop in to visit them during the day and then leave! Good luck OP.", "NTA\n\nUnless he is a moron, there would be no way for a SO not to know their family does not like their bf/gf. That fact alone and making them live in a cramped house with a number of people who are unruly, do not like them, exclude you from things, etc I would not be offended, but happy that you went in spite of it all and it is HIS job to stand up for you against his family for them to include you and accept you.\n\nGuys do not usually look forward to anything where we need to get dressed up, however he does need to grow a set as all relationships are compromise and sacrifice. Plus, he should be happy to see you all dressed up and looking gorgeous. \n\nHe needs to grow up because its ok for him to say your thing sucks but not ok for you to point out how his thing sucked for you?", "NTA", "This one hits home for me, as I just had a very similar argument with my wife about this past Thanksgiving.\n\nNTA. You told him your truth, while telling him it was ok to make that sacrifice. People don\u2019t want to feel like they \u2018owe\u2019 someone something, but tend to lose sight of the whole nature of compromise, and how it\u2019s a give-and-take.", "INFO: Why were you cold? Why couldn\u2019t you eat anything they did? I feel like there is stuff missing here. Why did you have to try hard not to embarrass him? Either they are a bit of a nightmare or they don\u2019t like you because you\u2019re seen as disdainful of their way of life. It would seem pretty rude if you had a guest for several days that didn\u2019t eat any of your food unless they had a specific dietary requirement.", "Nta, I\u2019m confused but why couldn\u2019t you eat the food they had? If you have a dietary requirment its not weird to bring some stuff for yourself, also bringing a dish is pretty normal even if not asked.\n\nAlso take out all the bits about cramped them not liking you etc even if you had the best time - you\nLiterally made a sacrifice because you didn\u2019t get to see your family?", "I have very little sympathy for picky adult eaters. How were you hungry the whole time? Cold? Are you incapable of putting in a sweater or asking for a blanket?\n\nBut beyond that, NtA. As someone in the middle of three days of entertaining inlaws, it absolutely is a sacrifice on our parts.", "NTA. You made a good point saying the party is only a few hours of his discomfort while you spent days like that.", "8 people, 1 bathroom? Nta", "Oh well next year take your new bf to your parents for Christmas and have a truly good holiday.  Your current bf seems too enmeshed with his family and not observant at all.  You sacrificed your holiday to make him happy and now he is pouting?  Nope.  He's the AH.", "NTA by a long shot. You are such a trooper because I would've broken up with Luke right as I was getting TF out of his family's house. You really have to consider if this is the future you want. As a grown, married, woman, who's put up with her fair share of mediocre treatment, I am here to tell you there are men out there who will roll out the red carpet for you, ensuring all your favourite things are made available during special occasions.", "NTA \nbut just curious... why did your boyfriend not let your parents know about your dietary needs... not eating for 3 days isn't healthy... and why would it not occur to him that starving yourself for 3 days was anything other than a sacrifice?? You probably should have communicated your needs at least enough so his parents were aware you weren't just being an ass about not eating any of the food they probably spent some time preparing (even if it's just chicken nuggets it still takes time and effort for 3 families of people).", "NTA. Bearing uncomfortable social situations for the sake of our SO is a sacrifice, absolutely. It's something we do to support our partner, not for our own sake. He's immature if he can't understand that.\n\nI don't understand why you couldn't eat any food though, super strange and it probably makes things even more awkward with them that you turn up your nose to ALL of their food.", "NTA. OP, as someone married to someone who\u2019s family doesn\u2019t like them and couldn\u2019t care less about there comfort, run. You don\u2019t want to be in this relationship long term.", "Break up now, you guys don\u2019t have core values and if his family doesn\u2019t like you now it won\u2019t get better.", "INFO: Why did you live on coffee for three days?  \n\n\nI think the word you should have used was \"compromise\"", "YTA.\n\n> his niece and nephew are unruly, they eat food that I don\u2019t\n\nThis is all I needed to read to know that OP is entitled.\n\n> his niece ruined a piece of my personalised luggage set,\n\nThis just confirmed that OP has been spoiled for a very, very long time.\n\n> Luke and I went to the store and I get a few snacks that I didn\u2019t need to keep in the kitchen so as not to offend his family but obviously I couldn\u2019t he eating those all the time.

OP was so worried about how it would look if they cooked themself a separate meal that they entirely neglected how rude they were *at* the meal! Listen, honey, I'm not rich enough to know how tell you you're wrong without scolding you, so I'm just going to say it. By eating as little as possible of the food that was cooked with you and everyone else there, you showed just how ungrateful you are for the work and effort and money that was put into it (but at least you didn't look clueless, right?). Do you *really* think that feeding you and a bunch of other people is a cheap/budget thing to do? Especially during the holiday? It's not. Holiday food is special and more expensive. Furthermore you insulted his family by saying their only value was you spending time to see him smile. His family is obviously of more value to him than that, and he wanted to share that value with you, but all you did was have a problem with it. Do you know why his family doesn't like you? It seems obvious to me. You were egotistical, rude, ungrateful. You came across as spoiled first, and on the way back you came across patronizingly as if doing this for him was a gift the way an adult might indulge a child in make-believe. Just because you can talk about it in a light-hearted way doesn't mean the severity was reduced. It seems like your boyfriend and his family live in reality and you live in appearances (or a pay-to-win fantasy).", "NTA \n\nIt's sad that your boyfriend is so oblivious to the quality of your experience until you say it out loud. You are not an asshole for bringing his attention to your perspective.", "I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nIf you bf is complaining about making a sacrifice for you, you're not wrong to remind him of the fact that y'all make sacrifices for each other when it comes to investing time into events you don't necessarily want to do. But it's not fun to be thinking \"wow, I just had a wonderful Christmas with my family and gf\" and have your partner remind you how terrible it was for them. Even if it's true! Y'all need to learn to make these sacrifices for each other without  (unintentionally or otherwise) holding it over the other's head. It can lead to a lot of festering guilt/resentment on both sides.", "INFO because I feel like, even with your edit, we're getting such a one sided story that I don't think I can judge this accurately.\n\nFirst off, how long have you and Luke been together? Is this a relatively new relationship? Have you been with him for more than a year? That would determine how often you see his family as well.\n\nSecondly, why does his family not like you? Is it for petty reasons, like you just have different interests? Has anything happened in the time you've know them? Is his family just genuinely difficult to get along with?\n\nThirdly, did his family choose not to accommodate for you and your dietary needs or was it a situation where you felt like you'd be burdening them by asking for the changes? And also, why didn't you go drive out to get food when you were hungry instead of surviving off of coffee and snacks? \n\nFourth, why didn't you and Luke stay in a hotel? Now, this one I think I could understand a bit more as I could see a situation where his family is insistent on you two not staying in a hotel, but if the accommodations were that small, did you ask about staying in a nearby hotel instead? Or was it a situation to save money? \n\nAnd finally, have you ever talked to Luke about any of your concerns about his family and about this holiday? Because, sure, it sounds like he was completely oblivious but I've said it before: people cannot read your mind. What may be obvious to you may not be obvious to others. It doesn't make him an asshole if you never brought it up before, but unless the situation was so bad that it should have been seen by anyone a mile away, it's hard to call Luke an asshole for not knowing how you really felt if you never brought it up and suddenly did like this. \n\nBecause I'm sure the lack of privacy can be uncomfortable but not an absolutely terrible thing (not unless his sister has three or more kids or something) and you haven't given enough information about the conversations you've had with his family at any point to judge.", "NTA. Surprise, families are different and getting offended that someone might not think your family is perfect is ridiculous. It's especially funny that he's convinced his family is perfect while bemoaning the fact that he's gonna have to tart himself up for your family.

It\u2019s very cramped quarters (3 bedrooms, 1 full bathroom), and very different to my own family\u2019s Christmas. Luke\u2019s family, his mother especially, are not my biggest fan (totally fair, as we\u2019re all very different), his niece and nephew are unruly, they eat food that I don\u2019t, all in all, not what I would call a good time. Nevertheless, I went to Christmas at Luke\u2019s request and tried my best to make sure I was not a burden or embarrassment to Luke while he tried to spend time with his family. \n\nToday, we left to go home, and tomorrow I will be going to see my mother for a few days before returning for New Year\u2019s, when Luke and I will be attending my friend\u2019s party. The party is a black tie event that Luke is not looking forward to as he doesn\u2019t know/like anyone going besides me.\n\nIn the car on the way home, he joked that he really wasn\u2019t looking forward to going. I joked back that I made a sacrifice going to his family for Christmas, so now it was his turn, and at least the party was only a few hours. Luke got offended that I said seeing his family was a sacrifice and asked if I really meant that. I said yes, I did, obviously I did, since I pretty much subsisted on coffee for 3 days, his niece ruined a piece of my personalised luggage set, and his family clearly don\u2019t like me. I said I was happy to go for him, and I would do it again, but it wasn\u2019t enjoyable for me beyond seeing him happy.\n\nThis was apparently deeply offensive as he said he felt like he\u2019d had a nice family Christmas and that I\u2019d ruined the memories now that he knew I was pretending the whole time.

He simply didn't care, because it wasn't affecting him personally.", ">It\u2019s on OP to communicate that to him, and it seemed like a bit of a \u2018gotcha\u2019 moment.\n\nSeriously Her BF is throwing a fit about not wanting to go to a party and she pointed out rightly that she did not have a good time with people who dont like her. \n\nShe wasnt doing this as. gotcha he was", "I\u2019m sorry, but he wasn\u2019t \u201csurprised.\u201d Who\u2019s going to be surprised that their partner didn\u2019t enjoy being cramped into a small house, sharing one bathroom with a bunch of people, some of which don\u2019t even *like* said partner? A damn liar or someone who\u2019s entirely oblivious and indifferent to their partner\u2019s feelings.", "He wasn't surprised about any of that. He knew about her dietary needs and what she needed to be comfortable, and he knew she wasn't getting it during that stay.\n\nHis only surprise was that he thought he was going to get away with defining reality as he chose, but instead of playing along with his script, she spoke the truth they both already knew.\n\nThat's not an issue that can be fixed by telling her to cOmUUUUniCaTe, because he already knows what reality is, he just thought he was going to get away with a few rounds of self-serving gaslighting.", "She had enough characters to make a vague edit, she could have used them for a real answer.", "Yeah but she could\u2019ve said she couldn\u2019t eat because of allergies or being a vegetarian/vegan. But she didn\u2019t. Which makes me think she\u2019s just a picky eater.", "I have a personalized luggage set bc it was a gift for graduation. It's long since been fucked up and travel stained but *I myself* did that. If someone else came and fucked with it, even in this state, I would still be upset bc they clearly don't respect my belongings.\n\nAnd yes, it is absolutely a sacrifice to visit family. Before I came out, every holiday with my family was peppered with homophobia and transphobia. It hurt to know that my family wanted me dead or in prison or in hell because of the way I was born. Since I've come out, not a single one of them has reached out to me lol and at this point good riddance.", "Yeah this whole thing screams OP comes from money and BF does not.  I also think the BFs family \"cooks\" like my family everything from a box or bag.  OP just thinks the food is gross (it is).\n\nHis family probably doesn't like her because she's \"snob or thinks she's better than us.\"  But OP is probably polite and friendly to family.  I come from people like this and it's amazing the mental gymnastics they'll go through to hate someone who has more than them.", "\"they eat food that I don't\" is confusing because of its placement in the sentence, but I think it refers to the whole family and not just the kids. \n\nI agree that we're not getting the whole picture, and I notice that OP manages to not actually answer any questions about  things like why she could only consume coffee, etc... I mean, if it's because she keeps kosher and they don't, or she has celiac disease then that's understandable and the boyfriend would be an asshole for putting her in that situation, but the fact that she won't actually give any details makes me think it's something silly.", "> I\u2019m sure she at food and you are taking the statement that she lived off coffee too literally. \n\nI am taking the statement that she said. Do you have additional information to add? All she added in the comments was \"I didn\u2019t mean the kids, I meant his whole family eat differently than I do, so I ate very little while I was there.\" Which does not sound like an allergy or intolerance. I also specifically mentioned allergies earlier. \n\nIf one's idea of a sacrifice is to eat pretty much nothing for three days, then there's a point where it's simply a lack of self respect. People deserve food. You should advocate for yourself to have food, or do what it takes to get something. It's not a mark of pride to say \"look! I didn't eat anything for days for you!\" And if someone thinks not eating is a sacrifice they deserve, then you shouldn't be in that relationship, and again, shows a lack of self-respect to stay in it.", "Doesn't sound like they know though? She said \"they eat food I *don't*\" not *can't*.", "Did I say it didn't suck? But what exactly do you accomplish when you don't eat anything? Was she trying to have some kind of hunger strike? \n\nShe is an adult. She should do what it takes to get herself fed. If that means door dash or getting her own groceries, then so be it. But claiming that the only option was to drink coffee and suffer implies an absolute lack of autonomy. Unless there's a reason for that, she's literally only punishing herself.", "It's not one dinner, she was there for days. I would never expect someone to host me for that long and not bring food for everyone. I think BF is the real asshole here for not bridging whatever gap was happening with respect to communication but OP is also acting helpless and like she has no agency. She also hasn't said she has any dietary restrictions but refuses to eat whatever their food is which makes it sound more like she's refusing to try, not that they aren't being hospitable.", "Yeah. Granted u don't get to choose the menu when ur a guest but even if I host I try and make stuff that everyone will eat.", "I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s vegan, and they\u2019re not. It would fit with what she said about just eating sides at meals.", "He\u2019s absolutely the AH here. If he wasn\u2019t aware that she was miserable, he\u2019s a remarkably dense person. However, from what she wrote, this came to him as a surprise. After reading her edit, I think she may be vegan or have some food allergies that keep her from eating what the family is eating. He may have thought she was ok with that, as weird as that sounds.", "You\u2019re probably right, but all we have to go on is what OP said. Unfortunately, it seems like she can\u2019t post responses here because of POO mode.", "Eh, he\u2019s definitely the AH, but this isn\u2019t remotely a case of Gaslighting. He may very well have already known that she was uncomfortable, which makes him even more the AH, but we don\u2019t know that. All we know is what OP said his reaction was when she told him. \n\nI guess we agree in principle; we\u2019re now just haggling over price.", "I was thinking that maybe she\u2019s of a different culture and is unwilling to try their food. That\u2019s the only thing that would make that statement make sense to me.", "In OP\u2019s defense, they cant answer when Poo Mode is on. But yeah, this does not seem like the whole story", "I just didn\u2019t take that statement literally. I assumed she ate granola bars or toast or small things not nothing. That\u2019s all. I think OP was talking in hyperbole. \n\nI agree that she should advocate for herself and what she eats but it\u2019s not always easy especially if they don\u2019t like her. It\u2019s hard for many to feel like an imposition in someone\u2019s else\u2019s home especially if they make every request feel like a burden. It\u2019s easy to say stick up for yourself until you are in that moment. Not saying she shouldn\u2019t just that it\u2019s easier said than done. \n\n From the post it seemed like no one accommodated her dietary needs so she was regulated to snacks. They also damaged her luggage, squeezed a bunch of people into a tiny house and didn\u2019t treat her well l. I get why she wanted her BF to acknowledge that it wasn\u2019t the best time for her.", "You expects your guests, who are traveling, to bring food for everyone? That seems even more unreasonable. You're going really hard on OP, which at this point is veeeerrrryy victim blamey.", "Yeah I'm guessing it's this, or something similar w/ gluten or whatever. It really doesn't need to be intentional! They probably just don't care. Which still is definitely not a good look...", "Personally I wouldn't trust the sides of that were the case.", "> this came to him as a surprise.\n\nLOL naw he was looking to get out of going to her things and it didnt work. He was the one who brought it up in the car and was hoping to get a response out of it along the lines oh you dont have to come sweetie your the best.", "We absolutely do know he knew she was uncomfortable and her basic needs were not being met -- it's right there in the post.\n\nHis absurd act trying to convince her that not only did he not know, the whole issue of her basic needs not being met didn't even happen so there's no favor or debt here, absolutely is gaslighting. He knew. He knew she knew that he knew. He tried to railroad her into pretending his fake narrative was reality.", "Some cultural foods are very hard to vegetarian, and a ton of things are very hard to impossible to vegan. Since OP was nibbling side dishes, I suspect it\u2019s both a food culture they don\u2019t eat because it\u2019s animal product heavy AND they\u2019re a veggie of some flavor.", "I was thinking she's vegan and they aren't, something along those lines.", "What are her dietary needs though? She didn't say anything about allergies, intolerances, vegan diet, vegetarian diet, anything! She just said they eat food she *doesn't* (not *can't*). If she's not eating their food and not communicating why, I'm sure that doesn't help them like her any more as that can be misinterpreted many ways.", "She's with her BF who is likely comfortable in their home. They're there for multiple days and have a car with them. Making lunch once or buying some snacks to share is unreasonable? \n\nAnd yes...she's a victim of her own preferences in food and in boyfriends \ud83d\ude44", "My boyfriend\u2019s family is Italian and do the 7 fishes dinner for Christmas and I HATE seafood. Can\u2019t even be around it. Our first year together, I ate side dishes and it was great, but his Nonna realized I didn\u2019t  like seafood and she felt terrible. Next year, and every year since, there was a lasagna included with the main courses. And she notes it whenever she cooks. \n\nIf they wanted to accommodate, they would.", "Several commenters were asking why his family disliked her. In my family being a vegan, casually mentioning it in a conversation, and bringing your own food would be more than enough for snarky comments and general mistreatment. Some people are so weird about food. It sounds like OP really did her best to minimize discomfort for BF\u2019s family, and he didn\u2019t care AT ALL. What an ass.", "And she called him on it, which was the right thing to do. I don\u2019t really think we disagree here. I only made the comment above about the \u2018gotcha\u2019 because I want to be magnanimous. In the end, I stand by my NTA judgement.", "But it doesn\u2019t say that in the post. It says she was miserable, and that he was shocked and offended when she told him that she considered it a sacrifice. That makes him dense or disingenuous, but doesn\u2019t make it gaslighting. If it WAS gaslighting, then her conversation with him wouldn\u2019t have gone the way it did, and she would probably be asking us a different question.", "I would argue it would be gaslighting if he claimed she was fed adequately, his family did like her, or her luggage was already damaged. He'd have to actively deny reality and challenge her sanity/ability to recall. He's not even bothering to do that, he's just outright saying \"your feelings are inconvenient for me so I'll punish you for having them\"  \n\nTo be clear his behaviour is equally shitty as gaslighting, it's just more blatant. Embarrassingly self centered and immature at best, at worst it's emotionally abusive.", "Buying snacks to share is fine, but it should not be the expectation of the host. \n\nThe onus of providing guests with food they can eat and enjoy IS ON THE HOST. The only time a guest should be expected to provide their own food is if they have severe food allergies, and the host can not guarantee there will be cross contamination. I have a cousin severely allergic to tree nuts so his parents always always always bring food for him that is safely prepared. Aside from that? No. This is hosting 101. You're just overtly victim blaming. Good luck with that.", "Yeah, I was kind of thinking along those lines too! The \"we're just very different\" comment from her fits in with this type of thing.", "Of course it was in the post. It's right there. And therefore of course it was gaslighting on his part.", "I still think that his trying to railroad her into going along with a blatantly false narrative, that they both knew that both of them knew was blatantly false, falls under the umbrella of gaslighting, but your way of splitting it out works for me too.", "Sure, but sounds like they provided food. I'm assuming they didn't eat the same thing for every meal for five days. OP hasn't said why she won't eat it so I can't assume she's a victim of anything. She seems like someone who has shown up at someone's home for five days and expected to be catered to instead of participating as a family. She's in someone's home, not a resort. She also seems like she would rather sulk and hold it against her BF than use her voice and problem solve. \n\nShe's not a victim, but I will blame her.", "Where? \n\nGaslighting is one of those therapy terms, like Narcissist, that gets thrown around too much. He\u2019s not trying to warp her sense of reality. He\u2019s not trying to tell her that things are different than what she experienced. They both agree that what happened, happened. He\u2019s the AH because he either can\u2019t or won\u2019t look at how that affects her, and is using that to justify his argument about the Black Tie Dinner. He\u2019s 100% in the wrong, but this IS NOT gaslighting.", "Again as host, you should make sure the food you serve is edible and enjoyable for your guests. She didn't show up out of the blue and expect white glove service. They invited her to stay and as such they have an obligation to make things as comfortable as possible. Part of that obligation is serving food or having food she likes to eat. I'd add we don't know if these restrictions are by choice or not, but even if they are voluntary that doesn't mean you, as host, don't bother providing your guest with food that they enjoy. Full stop.\n\nI guess you're a pretty epic grinch as you think showing a modicum of effort for your guest to feel comfortable is some grand imposition. As I said, best of luck with that and the rest of your day."]}
