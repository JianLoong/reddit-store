So to everyone saying I\u2019m not answering suspicious questions, I literally cant**\n\nI (26f) spent 22-26 of December with my bf\u2019s (\u201cLuke\u201d) family, staying at his parents\u2019 house along with his sister, her husband, and their kids. \n\nIt was a long few days to say the very least. It\u2019s very cramped quarters (3 bedrooms, 1 full bathroom), and very different to my own family\u2019s Christmas. Luke\u2019s family, his mother especially, are not my biggest fan (totally fair, as we\u2019re all very different), his niece and nephew are unruly, they eat food that I don\u2019t, all in all, not what I would call a good time. Nevertheless, I went to Christmas at Luke\u2019s request and tried my best to make sure I was not a burden or embarrassment to Luke while he tried to spend time with his family. \n\nToday, we left to go home, and tomorrow I will be going to see my mother for a few days before returning for New Year\u2019s, when Luke and I will be attending my friend\u2019s party. The party is a black tie event that Luke is not looking forward to as he doesn\u2019t know/like anyone going besides me.\n\nIn the car on the way home, he joked that he really wasn\u2019t looking forward to going. I joked back that I made a sacrifice going to his family for Christmas, so now it was his turn, and at least the party was only a few hours. Luke got offended that I said seeing his family was a sacrifice and asked if I really meant that. I said yes, I did, obviously I did, since I pretty much subsisted on coffee for 3 days, his niece ruined a piece of my personalised luggage set, and his family clearly don\u2019t like me. I said I was happy to go for him, and I would do it again, but it wasn\u2019t enjoyable for me beyond seeing him happy.\n\nThis was apparently deeply offensive as he said he felt like he\u2019d had a nice family Christmas and that I\u2019d ruined the memories now that he knew I was pretending the whole time. I\u2019m a bit confused as to how he would think I legitimately enjoyed being cold, hungry, and having no privacy for days on end, and not being with my family for Christmas. But either way, it was a choice I was happy to make for him and it\u2019s not the end of the world.\n\nI don\u2019t see how I\u2019m the AH for pointing out (humorously and with no malice) that I made a sacrifice for Luke, but he\u2019s been cold to me since I said it. Am I missing something here?\n\nEdit: It won\u2019t let me comment since this is a new account (don\u2019t have the karma) so for everyone asking about the food/why I mostly had coffee, I didn\u2019t want to seem like a jerk for buying and cooking my own food while there. Luke and I went to the store and I get a few snacks that I didn\u2019t need to keep in the kitchen so as not to offend his family but obviously I couldn\u2019t he eating those all the time. So at breakfast I had coffee, for lunch had another coffee/snack and for dinner I just ate what I could of whatever they were having (normally a bit of the side dishes). I thought it would come across really rude to buy and then use their kitchen to cook myself a whole separate meal.

That said, just the fact that you did not see your family for Christmas in order to visit his would automatically be considered a sacrifice by anyone. NTA", "NTA leaning to you're\n\nYou shouldn't have said that, not everybody is as outspoken as we are. The whole \"oh you ruined the memories\" act is not doing anything for me. The luggage is a cost of doing business. Why couldn't you mention that you could not eat any of the food? You did not subsist on coffee for 3 days.\n\nLuke could be terrible, I really don't know, but this seems like a failure of communication and the argument is that, as well.", "Some of this could have been something you communicated to your bf and have it be worked out. The food thing, that's something that you both can solve, that way after the trip is over you don't have to surprise him and say btw , i didn't eat for three days. That's not a compromise because its not something that he wants either. That's you being a martyr to avoid a communication.", "ESH.  You are not a match.\n\n1) Luke comes from a more modest family.  He enjoyed his family Christmas - cramped accommodations and all.  It sounds like you just don't like them and that they aren't your kind of people.\n\n2) You like black-tie event.  Luke does not.  \n\nYou all just like and want different things in life.", "NTA... not even a little bit.\n\nYou're obviously either a great actor or your BF is oblivious.  Either way, good on you for sticking it out!\n\nI HIGHLY recommend getting your own place when visiting people....particularly  inlaws.  As a general rule, I do not like staying with other people in their homes.  There are certain daily routines that just do not benefit from additional people in a space.", "NAH\n\nAnyone who has gone to their in-laws' for the holidays can relate. I know I can. I love my wife's family and we get along great. But it's another city. Actually it's the burbs of another city, so between that and the holidays, there isn't a whole lot to do. Not to mention that, as you say, staying in someone else's home can be uncomfortable. So I get it. Even my wife recognizes that it is a sacrifice. \n\nThere are a few reasons he doesn't understand. One possibility is that he has never made that sacrifice. Another is he was being a bit selfish and just refusing to relate. Hopefully it was not that. One more possibility is that you were more aggressive than you intended. I don't see any problem being frank about the fact that his family dislikes you because that discussion needs to happen. But comments like for example you \"subsisted on coffee\" might have been over the top depending on how you phrased them. Different cooking and cramped quarters are sacrifices to be sure, but it's to be expected. You're not staying at the Ritz.", "NTA, it's common sense you do for family. That includes SO even if your not feeling it. I go to Christmas with the inlaws every year and every year we get in the car and my wife thanks me for a great time. Not because I made Christmas happen or anything but because she knows I sacrificed what I want for what she wants. If I had my way I'd sit at home chilling for the holidays, she knows that and appreciates me going for her. It's obvious he was blind to the fact that it's a sacrifice for you, now he knows. I think it's always known just never really verbalized and when you verbalized it he had to acknowledge it. It may have even caused a bit of cognitive dissonance, realizing that they are not your family and you don't necessarily enjoy time with them.", "NTA\n\nIs this how you want to spend the rest of your life? Walking on eggshells while starving so that people who don't like you won't dislike you more? \n\nWho's choice is it for him to not go to your mother's with you? \n\n(I've seen the edit, so I'm not expecting answers. These are just things to think about.)", "INFO your edit didn\u2019t really clarify anything. Why couldn\u2019t you eat what his family cooked?  Do you have an allergy or intolerance?  Are you vegetarian or vegan? Idn there\u2019s a lot of people asking these questions and you chose not to answer. That\u2019s suspicious and I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s of a different culture and you just don\u2019t want to admit you didn\u2019t want to try a different culture\u2019s food..", "NTA. Your boyfriend seems very oblivious: \"I had such a great time, I didn't even notice that my girlfriend was uncomfortable, didn't eat a lot and was not treated very well by my family. But how could she ruin it all by pointing it out after I made clear that I will not enjoy going to her stupid New Years party!\"", "NTA. Listen, for years my partner's family weren't particularly fond of me; but they still went out of their way to make sure I had space, food I could eat, and were polite and pleasant to me over the holidays. It didn't make them (the holidays or the people) perfect of course; but my partner was well aware of the issues and helpful too.\n\nEta: clarified", "NAH.  Sometimes we put up with situations we absolutely are miserable in, let alone just uncomfortable in, for people we love.  You did that for Luke and, if it came across as you did in your post, you were pretty matter of fact about it.  Luke doesn't understand that he was comfortable and happy with his family in familiar circumstances.  You didn't really know the people well and the environment wasn't comfortable to you:  it doesn't have the same familiarity and memories to you.    That specific situation would have pushed my social skills for a day, let alone several days.\n\nAs for the food, I get you.  I have an extremely narrow range of what I like and remember being at my ex-husband's farm family for a long weekend while in the early stages of pregnancy and not being able to eat their food, both because I was pregnant and because I just hated it!  Like you, I went hungry for the weekend.  It's miserable.  And the heck with people who tell you you need to expand your tastes.  No, no you don't.  Usually the people saying that aren't willing to adapt to yours but judgmentally expect you to do all the adapting.  And, btw, his family hated me at the end of the weekend.\n\nHe should be willing to do the same for you at a party at your family.\n\nYou can have a easy-going conversation about it with Luke later where you can do some better communicating about it.  Expressing your discomfort right on top of his happy experience put a damper on it for him.  That's not to say you shouldn't have; it just possibly has something to do with his response.  His coldness is pretty immature, but in fact he's probably embarrassed as much as hurt.\n\nLuke appears to have some difficulty empathizing with you.  If he's otherwise empathetic, it's probably this uncomfortable experience and some immaturity on his part.  If he isn't, take this as a clear example of what you might be missing in his other behavior or in your relationship.  \n\nEssentially, I don't see this as an asshole issue, as I might with other Christmas nightmares.  You two seem good enough that this is just a relationship situation that needs to be communicated about with accommodations figured out so that it can be most comfortable for you both in the future.  Perhaps staying in a hotel or staying for a shorter time.  Relationships will sometimes hit a rough area and need to have it dealt with.  They aren't all deal breakers, although this might be one for either of you.  But you won't know without that conversation.  Hope next year is better.", "NTA, that was would be Luke, who didn't care or notice that you were not having a good time with his family.  You went to make him happy, he needs to realize that relationships aren't one sided where you bend over backwards for him and he doesn't want to go fir you.  He needs to suck it up or find someone whose self worth is all about him, his wants and needs not hers.", "INFO:\n\nYou said you spoke in the car home. If you had access to a car, why would the only thing you had for three days be coffee? I don't know how I'd be able to respect another adult if they couldn't problem-solve enough to:\n\n* Tell me that they were having trouble eating food\n* Go out to run errands and grabbing something to eat. Even a starbucks run could easily involve grabbing a sandwich\n* If both of these options somehow felt too embarassing (without context, I really can't imagine why), getting some granola bars to tide you over. \n\nUnless you've left out that you have a severe nut allergy they constantly ignored, what exactly did they serve that you couldn't eat and why would either your partner not know enough to speak up, or why would you choose to suffer silently? This just simply isn't a problem that should exist in an adult relationship, and I would personally not appreciate someone who chose to sit and sulk in silence for five days just to use it as ammunition on the way home.", "NTA your bf appears emotionally blind. Lot of folks are when it comes to their families, but its unreasonable of him to respond to you the way he currently is.", "His family may not like you because they are picking up on your obvious disdain for them. Criticizing their food and the accommodations they gave you. Grow up. You sound 16.", "OP - did you mention any of this to your bf? If he doesn\u2019t know, he won\u2019t know", "NTA.  Luke obviously thinks it was great to see his family. He's used to everything there. He did not see your POV. He's being thin skinned to not be able to understand you did not enjoy it as much as he did.  He can suck it up and go the party for a few hours.\n\nNext year (assuming you are still with Luke) and go to his family for Christmas, get a hotel room nearby and pop in to visit them during the day and then leave! Good luck OP.", "[removed]", "NTA", "This one hits home for me, as I just had a very similar argument with my wife about this past Thanksgiving.\n\nNTA. You told him your truth, while telling him it was ok to make that sacrifice. People don\u2019t want to feel like they \u2018owe\u2019 someone something, but tend to lose sight of the whole nature of compromise, and how it\u2019s a give-and-take.", "INFO: Why were you cold? Why couldn\u2019t you eat anything they did? I feel like there is stuff missing here. Why did you have to try hard not to embarrass him? Either they are a bit of a nightmare or they don\u2019t like you because you\u2019re seen as disdainful of their way of life. It would seem pretty rude if you had a guest for several days that didn\u2019t eat any of your food unless they had a specific dietary requirement.", "Nta, I\u2019m confused but why couldn\u2019t you eat the food they had? If you have a dietary requirment its not weird to bring some stuff for yourself, also bringing a dish is pretty normal even if not asked.\n\nAlso take out all the bits about cramped them not liking you etc even if you had the best time - you\nLiterally made a sacrifice because you didn\u2019t get to see your family?", "I have very little sympathy for picky adult eaters. How were you hungry the whole time? Cold? Are you incapable of putting in a sweater or asking for a blanket?\n\nBut beyond that, NtA. As someone in the middle of three days of entertaining inlaws, it absolutely is a sacrifice on our parts.", "NTA. You made a good point saying the party is only a few hours of his discomfort while you spent days like that.", "8 people, 1 bathroom? Nta", "Oh well next year take your new bf to your parents for Christmas and have a truly good holiday.  Your current bf seems too enmeshed with his family and not observant at all.  You sacrificed your holiday to make him happy and now he is pouting?  Nope.  He's the AH.", "NTA by a long shot. You are such a trooper because I would've broken up with Luke right as I was getting TF out of his family's house. You really have to consider if this is the future you want. As a grown, married, woman, who's put up with her fair share of mediocre treatment, I am here to tell you there are men out there who will roll out the red carpet for you, ensuring all your favourite things are made available during special occasions.", "NTA \nbut just curious... why did your boyfriend not let your parents know about your dietary needs... not eating for 3 days isn't healthy... and why would it not occur to him that starving yourself for 3 days was anything other than a sacrifice?? You probably should have communicated your needs at least enough so his parents were aware you weren't just being an ass about not eating any of the food they probably spent some time preparing (even if it's just chicken nuggets it still takes time and effort for 3 families of people).", "NTA. Bearing uncomfortable social situations for the sake of our SO is a sacrifice, absolutely. It's something we do to support our partner, not for our own sake. He's immature if he can't understand that.\n\nI don't understand why you couldn't eat any food though, super strange and it probably makes things even more awkward with them that you turn up your nose to ALL of their food.", "NTA. OP, as someone married to someone who\u2019s family doesn\u2019t like them and couldn\u2019t care less about there comfort, run. You don\u2019t want to be in this relationship long term.", "Break up now, you guys don\u2019t have core values and if his family doesn\u2019t like you now it won\u2019t get better.", "INFO: Why did you live on coffee for three days?  \n\n\nI think the word you should have used was \"compromise\"", "YTA.\n\n> his niece and nephew are unruly, they eat food that I don\u2019t\n\nThis is all I needed to read to know that OP is entitled.\n\n> his niece ruined a piece of my personalised luggage set,\n\nThis just confirmed that OP has been spoiled for a very, very long time.\n\n> Luke and I went to the store and I get a few snacks that I didn\u2019t need to keep in the kitchen so as not to offend his family but obviously I couldn\u2019t he eating those all the time.

OP was so worried about how it would look if they cooked themself a separate meal that they entirely neglected how rude they were *at* the meal! Listen, honey, I'm not rich enough to know how tell you you're wrong without scolding you, so I'm just going to say it. By eating as little as possible of the food that was cooked with you and everyone else there, you showed just how ungrateful you are for the work and effort and money that was put into it (but at least you didn't look clueless, right?). Do you *really* think that feeding you and a bunch of other people is a cheap/budget thing to do? Especially during the holiday? It's not. Holiday food is special and more expensive. Furthermore you insulted his family by saying their only value was you spending time to see him smile. His family is obviously of more value to him than that, and he wanted to share that value with you, but all you did was have a problem with it. Do you know why his family doesn't like you? It seems obvious to me. You were egotistical, rude, ungrateful. You came across as spoiled first, and on the way back you came across patronizingly as if doing this for him was a gift the way an adult might indulge a child in make-believe. Just because you can talk about it in a light-hearted way doesn't mean the severity was reduced. It seems like your boyfriend and his family live in reality and you live in appearances (or a pay-to-win fantasy).", "NTA \n\nIt's sad that your boyfriend is so oblivious to the quality of your experience until you say it out loud. You are not an asshole for bringing his attention to your perspective.", "I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nIf you bf is complaining about making a sacrifice for you, you're not wrong to remind him of the fact that y'all make sacrifices for each other when it comes to investing time into events you don't necessarily want to do. But it's not fun to be thinking \"wow, I just had a wonderful Christmas with my family and gf\" and have your partner remind you how terrible it was for them. Even if it's true! Y'all need to learn to make these sacrifices for each other without  (unintentionally or otherwise) holding it over the other's head. It can lead to a lot of festering guilt/resentment on both sides.", "INFO because I feel like, even with your edit, we're getting such a one sided story that I don't think I can judge this accurately.\n\nFirst off, how long have you and Luke been together? Is this a relatively new relationship? Have you been with him for more than a year? That would determine how often you see his family as well.\n\nSecondly, why does his family not like you? Is it for petty reasons, like you just have different interests? Has anything happened in the time you've know them? Is his family just genuinely difficult to get along with?\n\nThirdly, did his family choose not to accommodate for you and your dietary needs or was it a situation where you felt like you'd be burdening them by asking for the changes? And also, why didn't you go drive out to get food when you were hungry instead of surviving off of coffee and snacks? \n\nFourth, why didn't you and Luke stay in a hotel? Now, this one I think I could understand a bit more as I could see a situation where his family is insistent on you two not staying in a hotel, but if the accommodations were that small, did you ask about staying in a nearby hotel instead? Or was it a situation to save money? \n\nAnd finally, have you ever talked to Luke about any of your concerns about his family and about this holiday? Because, sure, it sounds like he was completely oblivious but I've said it before: people cannot read your mind. What may be obvious to you may not be obvious to others. It doesn't make him an asshole if you never brought it up before, but unless the situation was so bad that it should have been seen by anyone a mile away, it's hard to call Luke an asshole for not knowing how you really felt if you never brought it up and suddenly did like this. \n\nBecause I'm sure the lack of privacy can be uncomfortable but not an absolutely terrible thing (not unless his sister has three or more kids or something) and you haven't given enough information about the conversations you've had with his family at any point to judge.", "NTA. Surprise, families are different and getting offended that someone might not think your family is perfect is ridiculous.

I also specifically mentioned allergies earlier. \n\nIf one's idea of a sacrifice is to eat pretty much nothing for three days, then there's a point where it's simply a lack of self respect. People deserve food. You should advocate for yourself to have food, or do what it takes to get something. It's not a mark of pride to say \"look! I didn't eat anything for days for you!\" And if someone thinks not eating is a sacrifice they deserve, then you shouldn't be in that relationship, and again, shows a lack of self-respect to stay in it.", "Doesn't sound like they know though?

Due to the commonality of gluten-free items nowadays, it's not that hard to make gluten-free dishes, including gluten-free pasta. On top of that, if Luke's family didn't ask, Luke should have said, 'Hey, (parents or whoever's hosting everyone), OP doesn't eat all of the food everyone else does. Can there be some more main dishes of the type OP can have or can we possibly bring our own food to cook otherwise?'.

But if he didn't, that makes him a jerk, but then it would be up to her to stick up for herself and at least have a conversation with whoever is cooking/hosting to see what options she might have.

You keep emphasizing that you JOKED, you JOKINGLY told him you were unhappy, no you did not JOKE, you said a true thing in a lighthearted, but ultimately unclear manner. Normally this would be fine but he clearly didn't understand that you were serious, so you would just come across as passive aggressive. Disguising uncomfortable truths as jokes can be one way to get your point across but when you let someone believe you are joking repeatedly, it feels like a betrayal when they finally realize you were serious, when it turns out they were the joke all along. You know that saying, if you're not laughing with them, you're laughing at them?\n\nYou think it was obvious that you were having a bad time, but it clearly wasn't. We don't have enough info to know whether that communication disconnect was on your end or his, but you're the one posting and reading the replies so there's no point in us telling him to do better. \n\nThe same applies to your edits. I see you have enough karma to comment now, but even before that you had made multiple edits and still have not actually answered the question everyone is asking: WHAT couldn't you eat? We don't need to know WHY you felt it would be rude to cook for yourself, we want to know what specific foods you could/would not eat, and why specifically you could not eat them (medical sensitivity, allergy, religion, etc). This does matter a lot and I'm in the camp that it's weird you won't answer it. Makes me wonder if you're refusing to eat cultural dishes rather than actually unable to eat it.\n\nI don't want to say you're an asshole for the question in the title, but the whole post strikes me as pretty odd. Him not wanting to go to a party is also not comparable to disliking his family holidays. Both are a sacrifice you make for your partner, but getting along with his family is a much bigger deal than performing for your friends. Now that you have opened that line of communication you can discuss not spending days in a row with his family or getting a hotel when you visit. You can be upset at him for not going to the party but holding a family holiday over his head would be a dick move.", "NTA\n\nMaybe you could ask him to back up the conversation a bit. Go back to him not looking forward to going to this NYE party with you. \n\n* Was he joking? If so, what was the joke? Please explain the humor you were supposed to get from it.\n* What exactly did he expect you to feel about this information? Did he want you to be aware that he really wanted to back out of it, and was hoping you would just give him a pass because it wouldn't be fun for him even though you were looking forward to sharing the evening with him? Was he hoping you would appreciate the SACRIFICE he was making to do something nice for you?\n\nLet him explain his way through that. Then ask him how that differs (aside from the DAYS versus mere hours) from you not looking forward to several aspects of visiting his family's home but being willing to do it for his happiness. Aside from the time and immersion spent with his family compared to the hours and simple attendance spent on the NYE party, differences I can see include:\n\n* You didn't complain about the visit with his family in the days leading up to the visit (so that he could be well aware in advance that this wasn't going to be as fun for you as it was for him.\n* You didn't even complain to him during the visit or after... until he brought up his own discomfort with your event.\n* You understand and accept that he's not as excited about the party as you are and had been appreciating his willingness to attend (until he started complaining in advance).\n\n1. But he is offended that you didn't have as much fun with his family as he did - never mind the fact that it wasn't YOUR childhood home, your parents or sibling, your food habits, or the noise/food/temperature/crowd level that you are used to... for FOUR days.\n2. He doesn't appreciate that you dealt with those things so that he could share his family visit with you; he's upset that you are felt you had anything to deal with at all!\n\nTo recap: It's OK for him to complain about things you like that he doesn't, but it's horrifically rude of you to even acknowledge that some of what he enjoys isn't that fun for you. It's OK for you to feel guilty about any sacrifice on his part and be well aware he considers it a sacrifice/something negative - that shouldn't make you feel bad at all. But you are mean person who is ruining his happiness of you acknowledge that some of what you put up with for his happiness wasn't that fun for you. His feelings are all about him. He shouldn't feel sad or guilty. He shouldn't have to feel any discomfort. But that's fine for you to have to feel.\n\nPersonally, I'd be evaluating the relationship. If he doesn't get how selfish he is and start changing, then you might do better to leave him more free to just do as he pleases - on a more permanent basis.", "That is a perfect description, I have been in relationships where I felt like my partner saw themselves as the main character and me as the NPC instead of us as equal partners - I could do things I'd rather not, but if I wanted them to?

When I would spend part of the holidays with an ex's family we always made it a point to connect on things at the end of the day, so we both understood where the other was at and how we could best support each other moving forward.\n\nIf the quarters here were so cramped a nightly check-in wasn't possible, those snack runs would have been a great opportunity for him to check in, especially as he was seemingly aware she wasn't able to eat the food. Why not say to whoever prepares meals in his family, \"Hey, I'm going to bring back some take out for my partner so they can eat with us!\" Or even better, let that person know in advance some his partner's favorite foods and dietary restrictions so some attempt can be made. Whoever prepared meals may have been completely willing to make sure she ate and Luke never gave them the chance!\n\nIt sounds like he's emotionally immature and not very thoughtful.", "I always say in so many posts if the shoe was on the other foot they would never do it for you.", "My dad is a scruffy old cowboy and he will still wear a suit and dresses up without any complaints when he has to", "Well, it doesn't sound like you were staying with them, so it was easier to get some backup dinner afterward.\n\nIt's also rather uncomfortable and could lead to unnecessary fighting to advocate for yourself with a partner's family, especially one that isn't super warm to you. The relationship with his family is clearly tense, and she would know best if they would be offended by her using their kitchen to cook for herself. (Many families/cultures WOULD find that deeply offensive.)\n\nA thoughtful partner would happily advocate for you. It's unclear to me why Luke didn't let his family know in advance what his partner does and does not eat so they could plan for that. Perhaps they would have chosen not to, but he never even gave them an opportunity to be kind about it. He drove her to get snacks, but didn't do as your husband did, which was go out and get take-out for a more filling dinner option later on.\n\nHe never checked in with her to see how she was doing, how she felt spending Christmas away from her family, if there were any traditions she missed that they could find a way to incorporate, if she was getting enough to eat, if she was comfortable. Yes communication goes both ways but they were with HIS family, meaning she was the one out of her comfort zone, and it was his responsibility to be proactive and thoughtful.", "Like I said, we don't know nearly enough about the situation to give an accurate verdict. We can say he's thoughtless and emotionally immature. We could also say she doesn't stand up for herself and has become too accommodating and, thus, passive aggressive with her partner. We can say this because she decided to \"make a joke\" (which wasn't a joke, since it was the truth and how she really felt) to let him know the situation BECAUSE he didn't pay attention. We could easily say BOTH are emotionally immature with the way they handled it (him not checking in and noticing; her for not having a direct conversation and going about it in a very indirect way to poke a jab at his black tie event). \n\nBut that's the issue, isn't it? We're missing context that could change the verdict whichever way, depending on the answers given. If she told Luke to not worry about the situation and that she'd adjust, that could make her the asshole. Or if she had asked him to talk to his family and he didn't, he'd be the asshole. If her dietary needs were more along the lines of her just not liking the foods Luke's family made but she could theoretically eat, it could be a no asshole situation. Or if her dietary needs were something specific to her beliefs or culture, that would be him being an asshole.\n\nThere's just a lot of things being left out that WOULD make a difference. There's a lot we can fill in the blanks with, but still too much information we do not know that we can say one way or another if Luke's the asshole or her or nobody and just a lack of communication.", "\"They eat food I *don't*\", not *can't*.

Just a hunch.", "I \"don't\" eat sugary foods because I am a gastric patient, and it screws my digestion.  I don't eat fatty foods because I don't have a gallbladder and it will hurt me to do so.

It's very minor and I've not been tested since I was a kid, so it may have downgraded itself to an intolerance or at least, borders the line between the two. Only time it's a big issue is in the spring and fall, when my seasonal allergies come into play. The worst as far as food allergies go is my red food dye allergy. I can have things like Twizzlers, red jello, and M&M's just fine-basically in anything solid and small amounts of fruit punch. Give me liquid medication? I wet the bed-my red food dye allergy and my sugar one, the reaction is loss of bladder control. Thankfully, that's the only real reaction. My cousins with the nut allergies have needed epi-pens, though one went through that desensitization thing. All she has to do now is eat a peanut M&M to keep it that way.\n\nOnly reason it's tough is because of how much stuff's got sugar in it. The thing I have to do in the way of reading ingredient lists is with soy. I've got an underactive thyroid (inherited Hashimoto's) and soy proteins can mess with my medication if eaten within 8 hours of me taking the Levoxothyrine (Synthroid generic). You would not believe the amount of food that has soy in the ingredient list. About the only 'safe' soy product is soy lecithin, as it doesn't have the soy proteins in it. While Chinese and Japanese food, at least for my family, has always been eaten for dinner, there's been times where I've had to even check bento box recipes to make sure I'm not taking soy products to work with me for lunch unless I was working a shift where my 'lunch break' was past the 8 hour mark."]}
