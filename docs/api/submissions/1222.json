I\u2019m 16/F btw.\n\nSo my friend Abby ran off somewhere with her boyfriend 2 days ago, and didn\u2019t tell her parents where she was going. They\u2019ve been calling all her friends asking if we\u2019ve talked to her or if we know where she is. So last night after Abby\u2019s stepdad called me, I sent her a message telling her that she should call her parents. I guess they have access to her accounts somehow because right after her stepdad called me again and started yelling at me saying that he knew I was lying to him and that he knew I knew where Abby was, and that I\u2019d better start telling him the truth or I was going to be in big trouble. I didn\u2019t like him yelling at me so I just hung up my phone.\n\nAfter that Abby\u2019s stepdad called my dad and tried to get me in trouble, which is why my parents are now arguing about whether I was wrong to hang up the phone. My dad is saying that I should\u2019ve explained myself because hanging up just made the situation worse and made it look like I was lying about not knowing where Abby is, but my mom said that I have the right to hang up if I\u2019m being screamed at over something I didn\u2019t do and Abby\u2019s stepdad needs to check himself.\n\nSo AITA or is Abby\u2019s stepdad?", "created_utc": 1667578209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym30e9/aita_for_hanging_up_on_my_friends_stepdad_when_he/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In an ideal world, if everyone were an emotionless robot (or else able to perfectly regulate themselves and their emotional state at all times), then yeah, I'd 100% agree with your mother.\n\nBut to me, this situation isn't that cut-and-dried. On the one side we have a stepfather who, for all I know, is out of his mind with worry about his missing daughter. On the other, we have an intimidated teenager who's being yelled at by an adult who, by all accounts, has no right to be in such a position at all.\n\nMy gut says **NTA** on this one, though. Would it maybe have been a better decision to tell stepdad what you knew about Abby's situation the first time he called? Maybe. And I say maybe because without more context, even *that* could be a questionable call. \n\nBut even accounting for his likely-emotional state at the time, stepdad overstepped here and played this out badly. You are not the adult here, he is. That means he should have the restraint to understand who he's talking to and where the lines are.", "INFO:\n\nDo you know where your friend is?\n\nIf you don't then NTA\n\nNo parent should be yelling at someone else's kid. I understand he is worried, but then he should have talked to your parents so they could sit you down and have a calm talk on why it is important they find your friend.", "NTA and can\u2019t imagine why Abby bailed on this gem of a stepdad!", "NTA. Probably your friend's parents are terrified but it's also possible that she was in danger at home. Stepdad didn't have any business yelling at you and threatening you, you didn't do anything wrong. He should have contacted your parents.\nI hope Abby is safe.", "Nta. Your allegiance is with your friend and her dad was abusive for yelling at you. If she was kidnapped or in danger, you obviously must tell the dad but that is not the case. I would have hung up also.", "NTA. The stepdad is handling this poorly. That is somewhat understandable because this is definitely a troubling situation, but as the adult in this situation he shouldn't be taking his frustration out on you, a kid. The appropriate thing to do would have been to approach your parents and ask them to talk to you for more info or for him to talk to you with your parents present. It's not ok for him to threaten you or yell at you under any circumstance and you shouldn't be expected to tolerate that type of abuse.", "I just realized the AITA question is regarding hanging up on the stepdad. NTA to infinity for that. I was looking at the situation as a whole when saying my vote would be influenced by her home life. Even if it was wonderful to outsiders, though, it still would be sketchy to be yelling at you.", "No, I don't.", "And even parents should try to calmly reason with a child instead of resorting to shouting.", "Don't adults talk to minors all the time without asking for explicit permission.", "OP did try to help by urging her friend to call her step dad. She can't give him information she doesn't have.\n\nAnd while his heightened feelings are understandable that still doesn't give him the right to take them out on others and yell at a child/teenager.", "Maybe his unhinged yelling is why she left in the first place.", "Where does OP say she knew where her friend was?  All she did was message to encourage her to get in touch with her parents.  When I've had family members and friends go missing I've reached out via text to encourage them to get in touch just to let us know they are safe.", "I did try to help the first time he called, I told him when the last time was that I talked to Abby and that she didn't say anything to me about leaving to go with her boyfriend.", ">I infer from this that you didn't actually know *where* she was, so okay. But you did know who she was with, clearly.\n\nI maybe didn't explain this well, but I only even know that she's with her boyfriend because that's what her stepdad told me. They know that she went somewhere with him but she refused to say where they were going or when they were going to come back.", "I don't know where she is, all I know is that she went somewhere with her boyfriend but refused to say where they were going or when they were coming back.", "Then NTA. I understand that he's fraught and worried, but it's not ok for him to take that out on a kid.", "They shouldn\u2019t if it involves screaming at and threatening minors.  If it\u2019s at that stage, you go to the parents.", "Oh, well, in that case even more NTA. Thank you for clarifying!", "Well he had no right to yell at you and if an adult was yelling at my kid. My husband and I would be arguing over who was going to have a chat with this man about calling my kid and yelling at them."]}
