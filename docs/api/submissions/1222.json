I didn\u2019t like him yelling at me so I just hung up my phone.\n\nAfter that Abby\u2019s stepdad called my dad and tried to get me in trouble, which is why my parents are now arguing about whether I was wrong to hang up the phone. My dad is saying that I should\u2019ve explained myself because hanging up just made the situation worse and made it look like I was lying about not knowing where Abby is, but my mom said that I have the right to hang up if I\u2019m being screamed at over something I didn\u2019t do and Abby\u2019s stepdad needs to check himself.\n\nSo AITA or is Abby\u2019s stepdad?", "created_utc": 1667578209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym30e9/aita_for_hanging_up_on_my_friends_stepdad_when_he/", "score": 2436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In an ideal world, if everyone were an emotionless robot (or else able to perfectly regulate themselves and their emotional state at all times), then yeah, I'd 100% agree with your mother.\n\nBut to me, this situation isn't that cut-and-dried. On the one side we have a stepfather who, for all I know, is out of his mind with worry about his missing daughter. On the other, we have an intimidated teenager who's being yelled at by an adult who, by all accounts, has no right to be in such a position at all.\n\nMy gut says **NTA** on this one, though. Would it maybe have been a better decision to tell stepdad what you knew about Abby's situation the first time he called? Maybe. And I say maybe because without more context, even *that* could be a questionable call. \n\nBut even accounting for his likely-emotional state at the time, stepdad overstepped here and played this out badly.
