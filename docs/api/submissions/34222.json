When she was 7 her mom got diagnosed with cancer so I started to help out with raising her. Her and Ed were best friends so it was easy. When she was 10 her mom passed away so I took over all duties of raising a daughter. She started to date my son in college and they got married later on. \n\nI genuinely look at her as my daughter because I basically raised her (her dad drank himself to death when she was 19) with my family. Like she would spend all the holidays like school breaks and go with us to holidays ect.\n\nWhen they got married they bought the house 4 houses down and has been living there. \n\nNow Cat is very sweet she can cook well and we bond in the kitchen and we get along great. But I really don\u2019t like being called Mom by her I don\u2019t know why but I just don\u2019t. I don\u2019t like it when people or children call me Aunty or nicknames ect. I don\u2019t mind Edna calling me Mom because I feel like I raised her and earned that title. \n\nI have talked to her and my son many times about this. It makes me uncomfortable and she says it shouldn\u2019t. That it is awkward for her to call me by my first name. \n\nThis new years dinner she made it a point to call me mom in every sentence and I was annoyed. I pulled her aside and told her to knock it off and she said it\u2019s not fair that Edna can call me mom but she can\u2019t. I told her that i raised Edna so it makes sense. Edna has no family other than us but you have a huge family with a mom that loves you very much.\n\nShe said that she feels like I\u2019m rejecting her from the family and I told if after all I have done for you and this is the thing that makes you feel isolated then you need help to be grateful. ( for context Among other things I paid half of her college loans and helped her pay for the house they live in.)\n\nShe said that I\u2019m a bitch and Edna can be my favorite DIL and it\u2019s creepy that I will bbsite pups and not my gdkids because she and Sam won\u2019t ever come back. I told her to get out and be a brat somewhere else. Sam got involved and dragged Cat away. \n\nCat lives 6 hours away and I can\u2019t drive well and they don\u2019t have gust bed for me to stay the night. I pay 25% in childcare tho. E and I have spa days once a month a tradition since she was a teen. So when Cat comes we all go for a spa trip and i always pay. \n\nSam sent me text asking me to apologize because it\u2019s such a small thing and that cat is serious about her threat.\n\nI left him on read because I didn\u2019t think I need to apologize.\n\nEven my grandchildren call me by my name. They rarely call me grandma and they like calling me by my name.\n\nActually Edna doesn\u2019t call my mom often. She does sometimes but she always uses my name because she knows I\u2019m comfortable with it. If Cat called me mom one of I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s just ever single sentence that\u2019s directed to me ends or starts with mom and I feel so uncomfortable\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704255355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xa5oy/aita_for_kicking_my_dil_out_on_nye_calling_me_mom/", "score": 328, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't fathom how others are saying otherwise.  People seem to not have the bandwidth to realise this ISNT you favouring one DIL over the other. This is about DIL being insecure about her SIL being raised by her MIL. How come noone is addressing that you have spoken to them about not being called mum, and the answer given was 'you shouldn't feel like that'. And then continue to call you mum to what end?", "NTA, if you don't want someone to call you mum, then fair enough. You asked Cat nicely to stop, and she didn't. Only your kids call you mum, which includes Edna. Even you grandkids call you by your name, each to their own.\nYou raised Edna, so you see her as a daughter who just happens to be your DIL. Edna would call you mum regardless if she was married to your son, it seems.\n\nI see where Cat can think this is unfair, but she is ignoring the fact that you raised Edna. She also ignored you and doubled down when you asked her not to be called mum. Which makes her the AH.", "ESH. I disagree with the people saying you\u2019re playing favorites. \n\nI think the distinction that Cat and some commentors are missing is this: Edna isn\u2019t being allowed to call you \u201cmom\u201d because she married your son. She is calling you mom\nBecause you were, functionally, her mom. Cat is getting frustrated because she is looking at it like \u201cwe are both SILs, so we should both be able to call you this.\u201d Instead of saying @she can call\nMe that because I raised her\u201d a better way to explain things to Cat would be to say \u201cshe can call\nMe that because I felt like her mom, even before she was dating my son. It has nothing to do with them being married and wveything to do with her having been my daughter since she was X years old.\u201d\n\nAlso, people are getting in you about playing favorites, which is also nonsense. Of course you\u2019re going to have more of a bond with a girl you helped raise. What matters is hat you make an effort to have a good relationship with both of this, which you seem to be doing.\n\nSo Cat is an AH for not grasping this and respecting your boundaries and for using her kids as threats/leverage.\n\nBut you\u2019re also an AH for Turing this transactional. The response to \u201cI feel rejected from the family\u201d should not be to talk about money and paying for things and gratitude. The response to somebody feeling emotionally rejected is to hug them, tell them of course you love them, this is just a thing for you, etc.\n\nI hope you do make up with Cat, because Ben is you were right to be angry at her in the first instance, you\u2019re going to lose this war, and with it, perhaps your son and grandchildren.", "ESH. Cat ignored a boundary you set, and that is an AH behavior. I think you joined her in AH territory when you turned your relationship into (in my view) a transaction by implying that all that you \u201chave done\u201d for her means she is not entitled to her hurt feelings and feeling less accepted - that she feels that way is ungrateful, spoiled, and bratty. Cat went further into AH territory by calling you a name. My perception from your post is that you\u2019re not that crazy about Cat. I wonder if all you\u2019ve done for her is really for her or for you and/or your son.", "Yta. You strick me as the type of women that people don't call grandma because you've gone out of your way to make sure no one calls you that. Your own grandkids call you by your name not grandma because that's what you force people to do in some cutsey bs way. You are completely playing favorite and besides that just a sh!t human. Who honestly gets so offended because they're DIL called them mom. Not only that, Edna can call you mom you let her do it she just doesn't do it often and your fine with it. But your other DIL can never call you that. It's the screaming definition of playing favorites. You said it your self Edna can do whatever cause you \"raised her\" which is some incest level sh!t cause you raised her as a daughter which would mean you raised her and your son as siblings and they started dating which you had no problem with. But cat calling you mom is worthy of kicking her out and ruining the relationship with your other son. You are without a doubt the @ssh0le", "YTA you are lucky that both dils like you enough to want to call you that. A lot of mother in law and daughter in law relationships are awful and end in very little contact. This is a really stupid hill to die on.", "NTA Cat is trying to force a connection that just isn't there. You don't owe it to Cat to treat her the same way you treat someone you practically raised. All the people calling you an AH would be singing a different tune if you were trying to force Cat to call your mom, and she wasn't comfortable with it.", "NTA.  It's basic respect to call someone by the name they prefer, and vice versa.  Cat is the one that owes an apology.", "going against the grain and saying NTA. \n\nyour own grandkids call you by your first name and \u201cEdna\u201d only calls you mom rarely. why would \u201cCat\u201d get to call you mom when she has no blood relation to you and is only related to you through a marriage when your own grandchildren don\u2019t???\n\n\u201cEdna\u201d is basically your child because you\u2019ve raised her since childhood and way before she married your son. it only makes sense she would earn the right to call you her mother, you basically were.\n\nMOST OF ALL!! everyone is entitled to being called what they want by their peers, regardless. if you are generally uncomfortable with being called names other than your actual first name, that is perfectly valid.", "NTA, but you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. You could stop paying for everything and cut off all contact and see what happens. You should probably visit a counselor and get a professional opinion.", "NTA. I\u2019d find it weird if my DIL called me mom and i never called my MIL mom.  You have a very valid reason for the exception with one DIL.  I don\u2019t understand why Cat is making such a big deal out of this.  It\u2019s just odd.", "NTA, everyone who says otherwise is insane. You have an absolute right not to be called mom if it makes you feel uncomfortable. your DIL was looking for a fight by pushing past the boundary to get a rise out of you.", "Geez Louise......when I married into my husband's family, there was already a grandchild with my daughter's name with the exception of adding an \"h\" to the end of it. So the nicknames \"Thing 1 & 2\" became the norm for both of the girls. In all fun, my daughter gave my mother in love(law) her own nickname and she calls her \"June-bugg\" even though my mother in love was born in May. I refer to her as \"mom\" because my own mama loved her as much as I do and she hasn't tried to take over the memories of replacing my wonderful mama. She's an extension of that love.", "We can argue all day long about who is right or wrong. That's going to get you precisely nowhere. You don't have to compromise on the mom thing. But you could find a different way to make Cat feel worthy of your love.\n\nYou sound a lot like my dad. He wasn't really raised with a whole lot of warmth. Being emotional for him is to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. He shows love with money. It's hard but i would give anything if he'd do some of the following. Why don't you have a conversation about some things that Cat loves? Talk to her about you and maybe explain why emotions are a bit tough for you. I know that itself is hard. But if my dad had ever reached out and said, \"Hey, some things are tough for me because <whatever legit reason>. But I love you and I like you. I don't want to make you feel rejected. Let's begin again, please. So what can we do to create a bond, something for just you and me?\"\n\nYou can say that you would feel so loved and accepted if in return she would consider your feelings in being called mom. It's not perfect and it'll take time and discomfort. But it depends on whether you want to feel right or to have a relationship with your son, DIL and grandkids.\n\nOn a final note, you give reasons why you can't visit them but it sounds like you have enough money to hire a driver/ride a train/fly to where they live, and stay in a hotel. You are stuck in giving reasons for why you don't want to go when you could be spending that energy on findings ways you can go. Or meeting in the middle. You're hurt about not being invited to stay at their house. Understandable. But you're putting a wall up, I'm guessing in part because that hurt. You're hurt. She's hurt. So you're not hearing each other.", "ESH. Yes, you're a weirdo, playing favorites, and being an AH. But your DIL could cool it a little. Nevertheless, you are the type to waive a pocketbook around and think it makes you a queen rather then what you are, a MOTHER in law.", "I am an asshole for pushing my opinion but YOUR VERY MUCH THE ASSHOLE for making this a scene.. \ud83e\udd2c She wants to call you mom.. Not like she wants to call you BITCH (which I would if you had done that to me..).. The girl wants to be close to her love's mother.. My inlaws are called mom & dad just like my parents.. I would only say otherwise if my wife wants me to treat them any different which would also make me not want to treat them as family. (thankfully she doesn't & her parents aren't an asshole like this dear OP)..", "I don't know how you can correct what you have done. I think it just feels good to you to reject someone begging for affection. And when that person calls you out for it then you feel offended?  \nYTA", "I cant imagine calling my mil mom when she asked me not to. Its hugely disrespectful to call anyone by a name they've asked you not to.   So putting all the other stuff aside, for this.  any person is entitled to be addressed how they wish.   Well, maybe if you asked to be addressed as your majesty that would cross the line.  So NTA \n\nhowever,  is this a hill you're willing to die on?  Best think about that.", "Nta. You\u2019ve already set a boundary which she ignored. You don\u2019t like to be called mom by her and that is ok. People can say i would never not let my dil call me mom but thats their preference. \n\nAnd people don\u2019t realize that edna has been in your life from 7 years old of course you have a better relationship with her than cat. Her need to call you mom by stomping on your boundaries is what ruined the relationship.", "NTA. Although they have both married into your family, the relationship is much different. To continue to call someone a name they have asked you not to is grossly disrespectful. Cat is picking a fight for no good reason.", "NTA you don\u2019t feel comfortable with people calling you mom and that\u2019s okay. Even your own grandkids call you by your name. What make cat think she\u2019s so special to call you something that makes you uncomfortable and that your own grandkids don\u2019t? She\u2019s a entitled rude brat and she should apologise and go have her tantrum somewhere else", "YTA\n\n1.  You equate love with money.

You\u2019re uncomfortable with anyone calling you any name but you\u2019re given first name, but Edna is somehow exempt from this? Let\u2019s call a spade a spade.

You don\u2019t want to be called Mom. I get it. But you\u2019re not listening when Cat tells you that she can\u2019t call you by your first name. And boy howdy do I get that. I\u2019ve known my MIL and FIL for 30 years. I go out of my way in all scenarios to avoid using their names at all. I can\u2019t call them by their first names. I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s not how I was raised. But I refuse to call them Mr and Mrs. And Mom and Dad doesn\u2019t feel right either. So I just don\u2019t call them anything. Cat probably feels more comfortable carving out her own tongue than calling you by your first name. And just like she should respect that you don\u2019t wish to be called Mom. You should respect that she can\u2019t use your first name. So use some sort of nickname or pet name or even a joke name. My brother to this day calls my mom \u201chey lady\u201d after she got frustrated one time when we were kids and said \u201cstop saying mom!  I\u2019m not mom anymore!\u201d It\u2019s cute now and their little inside joke. Maybe Cat could call you \u201cnot mom\u201d or \u201cMama Your Name.\u201d Just find a name you can both live with and move on to things that actually matter. And hey; it could be worse.

This is one hell of a hill you built to die on due to poor communication and, whether you meant to or not, you created this situation and you need to fix it.\n\nBy all means, keep that boundary if you feel the need to, but explain to her exactly why you would prefer it that way and for the love of all that is fucking holy, do NOT make it sound conditional if that's truly not the case.", "Yup, YTA.

For us, it is a mutual way of respecting each other's parents and recognizing that they all played a part in the \"villiage\" that raised us. Our parents are not especially close friends with each other, but all again recognize that each parent in turn played a part in keeping us kids safe, happy, healthy, supported and loved. \n\nMaybe Cat is insecure about everyone else being allowed to call you mom (if only occasionally) while she herself is excluded; or her feelings about the title could be similar to mine and my friend group in that she could be trying to show you the love and deference that usually accompanies such a title. I mean, you literally are her mother in law, which, with the right chemistry, could easily take on the role of a normal mother. You already mentioned that you've been supportive, both emotionally and financially, to Cat, your son, and your grandkids.
