When she was 7 her mom got diagnosed with cancer so I started to help out with raising her. Her and Ed were best friends so it was easy. When she was 10 her mom passed away so I took over all duties of raising a daughter. She started to date my son in college and they got married later on. \n\nI genuinely look at her as my daughter because I basically raised her (her dad drank himself to death when she was 19) with my family. Like she would spend all the holidays like school breaks and go with us to holidays ect.\n\nWhen they got married they bought the house 4 houses down and has been living there. \n\nNow Cat is very sweet she can cook well and we bond in the kitchen and we get along great. But I really don\u2019t like being called Mom by her I don\u2019t know why but I just don\u2019t. I don\u2019t like it when people or children call me Aunty or nicknames ect. I don\u2019t mind Edna calling me Mom because I feel like I raised her and earned that title. \n\nI have talked to her and my son many times about this. It makes me uncomfortable and she says it shouldn\u2019t. That it is awkward for her to call me by my first name. \n\nThis new years dinner she made it a point to call me mom in every sentence and I was annoyed. I pulled her aside and told her to knock it off and she said it\u2019s not fair that Edna can call me mom but she can\u2019t. I told her that i raised Edna so it makes sense. Edna has no family other than us but you have a huge family with a mom that loves you very much.\n\nShe said that she feels like I\u2019m rejecting her from the family and I told if after all I have done for you and this is the thing that makes you feel isolated then you need help to be grateful. ( for context Among other things I paid half of her college loans and helped her pay for the house they live in.)\n\nShe said that I\u2019m a bitch and Edna can be my favorite DIL and it\u2019s creepy that I will bbsite pups and not my gdkids because she and Sam won\u2019t ever come back. I told her to get out and be a brat somewhere else. Sam got involved and dragged Cat away. \n\nCat lives 6 hours away and I can\u2019t drive well and they don\u2019t have gust bed for me to stay the night. I pay 25% in childcare tho. E and I have spa days once a month a tradition since she was a teen. So when Cat comes we all go for a spa trip and i always pay. \n\nSam sent me text asking me to apologize because it\u2019s such a small thing and that cat is serious about her threat.\n\nI left him on read because I didn\u2019t think I need to apologize.\n\nEven my grandchildren call me by my name. They rarely call me grandma and they like calling me by my name.\n\nActually Edna doesn\u2019t call my mom often. She does sometimes but she always uses my name because she knows I\u2019m comfortable with it. If Cat called me mom one of I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s just ever single sentence that\u2019s directed to me ends or starts with mom and I feel so uncomfortable\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704255355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xa5oy/aita_for_kicking_my_dil_out_on_nye_calling_me_mom/", "score": 3099, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't fathom how others are saying otherwise.  People seem to not have the bandwidth to realise this ISNT you favouring one DIL over the other. This is about DIL being insecure about her SIL being raised by her MIL. How come noone is addressing that you have spoken to them about not being called mum, and the answer given was 'you shouldn't feel like that'. And then continue to call you mum to what end?", "NTA, if you don't want someone to call you mum, then fair enough. You asked Cat nicely to stop, and she didn't. Only your kids call you mum, which includes Edna. Even you grandkids call you by your name, each to their own.\nYou raised Edna, so you see her as a daughter who just happens to be your DIL. Edna would call you mum regardless if she was married to your son, it seems.\n\nI see where Cat can think this is unfair, but she is ignoring the fact that you raised Edna. She also ignored you and doubled down when you asked her not to be called mum. Which makes her the AH.", "ESH. I disagree with the people saying you\u2019re playing favorites. \n\nI think the distinction that Cat and some commentors are missing is this: Edna isn\u2019t being allowed to call you \u201cmom\u201d because she married your son. She is calling you mom\nBecause you were, functionally, her mom. Cat is getting frustrated because she is looking at it like \u201cwe are both SILs, so we should both be able to call you this.\u201d Instead of saying @she can call\nMe that because I raised her\u201d a better way to explain things to Cat would be to say \u201cshe can call\nMe that because I felt like her mom, even before she was dating my son. It has nothing to do with them being married and wveything to do with her having been my daughter since she was X years old.\u201d\n\nAlso, people are getting in you about playing favorites, which is also nonsense. Of course you\u2019re going to have more of a bond with a girl you helped raise. What matters is hat you make an effort to have a good relationship with both of this, which you seem to be doing.\n\nSo Cat is an AH for not grasping this and respecting your boundaries and for using her kids as threats/leverage.\n\nBut you\u2019re also an AH for Turing this transactional. The response to \u201cI feel rejected from the family\u201d should not be to talk about money and paying for things and gratitude. The response to somebody feeling emotionally rejected is to hug them, tell them of course you love them, this is just a thing for you, etc.\n\nI hope you do make up with Cat, because Ben is you were right to be angry at her in the first instance, you\u2019re going to lose this war, and with it, perhaps your son and grandchildren.", "ESH. Cat ignored a boundary you set, and that is an AH behavior. I think you joined her in AH territory when you turned your relationship into (in my view) a transaction by implying that all that you \u201chave done\u201d for her means she is not entitled to her hurt feelings and feeling less accepted - that she feels that way is ungrateful, spoiled, and bratty. Cat went further into AH territory by calling you a name. My perception from your post is that you\u2019re not that crazy about Cat. I wonder if all you\u2019ve done for her is really for her or for you and/or your son.", "Yta. You strick me as the type of women that people don't call grandma because you've gone out of your way to make sure no one calls you that. Your own grandkids call you by your name not grandma because that's what you force people to do in some cutsey bs way. You are completely playing favorite and besides that just a sh!t human. Who honestly gets so offended because they're DIL called them mom. Not only that, Edna can call you mom you let her do it she just doesn't do it often and your fine with it. But your other DIL can never call you that. It's the screaming definition of playing favorites. You said it your self Edna can do whatever cause you \"raised her\" which is some incest level sh!t cause you raised her as a daughter which would mean you raised her and your son as siblings and they started dating which you had no problem with. But cat calling you mom is worthy of kicking her out and ruining the relationship with your other son. You are without a doubt the @ssh0le", "YTA you are lucky that both dils like you enough to want to call you that. A lot of mother in law and daughter in law relationships are awful and end in very little contact. This is a really stupid hill to die on.", "NTA Cat is trying to force a connection that just isn't there. You don't owe it to Cat to treat her the same way you treat someone you practically raised. All the people calling you an AH would be singing a different tune if you were trying to force Cat to call your mom, and she wasn't comfortable with it.", "NTA.  It's basic respect to call someone by the name they prefer, and vice versa.  Cat is the one that owes an apology.", "going against the grain and saying NTA. \n\nyour own grandkids call you by your first name and \u201cEdna\u201d only calls you mom rarely. why would \u201cCat\u201d get to call you mom when she has no blood relation to you and is only related to you through a marriage when your own grandchildren don\u2019t???\n\n\u201cEdna\u201d is basically your child because you\u2019ve raised her since childhood and way before she married your son. it only makes sense she would earn the right to call you her mother, you basically were.\n\nMOST OF ALL!! everyone is entitled to being called what they want by their peers, regardless. if you are generally uncomfortable with being called names other than your actual first name, that is perfectly valid.", "NTA, but you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. You could stop paying for everything and cut off all contact and see what happens. You should probably visit a counselor and get a professional opinion.", "NTA. I\u2019d find it weird if my DIL called me mom and i never called my MIL mom.  You have a very valid reason for the exception with one DIL.  I don\u2019t understand why Cat is making such a big deal out of this.  It\u2019s just odd.", "NTA, everyone who says otherwise is insane. You have an absolute right not to be called mom if it makes you feel uncomfortable. your DIL was looking for a fight by pushing past the boundary to get a rise out of you.", "Geez Louise......when I married into my husband's family, there was already a grandchild with my daughter's name with the exception of adding an \"h\" to the end of it. So the nicknames \"Thing 1 & 2\" became the norm for both of the girls. In all fun, my daughter gave my mother in love(law) her own nickname and she calls her \"June-bugg\" even though my mother in love was born in May. I refer to her as \"mom\" because my own mama loved her as much as I do and she hasn't tried to take over the memories of replacing my wonderful mama. She's an extension of that love.", "We can argue all day long about who is right or wrong. That's going to get you precisely nowhere. You don't have to compromise on the mom thing. But you could find a different way to make Cat feel worthy of your love.\n\nYou sound a lot like my dad. He wasn't really raised with a whole lot of warmth. Being emotional for him is to feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. He shows love with money. It's hard but i would give anything if he'd do some of the following. Why don't you have a conversation about some things that Cat loves? Talk to her about you and maybe explain why emotions are a bit tough for you. I know that itself is hard. But if my dad had ever reached out and said, \"Hey, some things are tough for me because <whatever legit reason>. But I love you and I like you. I don't want to make you feel rejected. Let's begin again, please. So what can we do to create a bond, something for just you and me?\"\n\nYou can say that you would feel so loved and accepted if in return she would consider your feelings in being called mom. It's not perfect and it'll take time and discomfort. But it depends on whether you want to feel right or to have a relationship with your son, DIL and grandkids.\n\nOn a final note, you give reasons why you can't visit them but it sounds like you have enough money to hire a driver/ride a train/fly to where they live, and stay in a hotel. You are stuck in giving reasons for why you don't want to go when you could be spending that energy on findings ways you can go. Or meeting in the middle. You're hurt about not being invited to stay at their house. Understandable. But you're putting a wall up, I'm guessing in part because that hurt. You're hurt. She's hurt. So you're not hearing each other.", "ESH. Yes, you're a weirdo, playing favorites, and being an AH. But your DIL could cool it a little. Nevertheless, you are the type to waive a pocketbook around and think it makes you a queen rather then what you are, a MOTHER in law.", "I am an asshole for pushing my opinion but YOUR VERY MUCH THE ASSHOLE for making this a scene.. \ud83e\udd2c She wants to call you mom.. Not like she wants to call you BITCH (which I would if you had done that to me..).. The girl wants to be close to her love's mother.. My inlaws are called mom & dad just like my parents.. I would only say otherwise if my wife wants me to treat them any different which would also make me not want to treat them as family. (thankfully she doesn't & her parents aren't an asshole like this dear OP)..", "I don't know how you can correct what you have done. I think it just feels good to you to reject someone begging for affection. And when that person calls you out for it then you feel offended?  \nYTA", "I cant imagine calling my mil mom when she asked me not to. Its hugely disrespectful to call anyone by a name they've asked you not to.   So putting all the other stuff aside, for this.  any person is entitled to be addressed how they wish.   Well, maybe if you asked to be addressed as your majesty that would cross the line.  So NTA \n\nhowever,  is this a hill you're willing to die on?  Best think about that.", "Nta. You\u2019ve already set a boundary which she ignored. You don\u2019t like to be called mom by her and that is ok. People can say i would never not let my dil call me mom but thats their preference. \n\nAnd people don\u2019t realize that edna has been in your life from 7 years old of course you have a better relationship with her than cat. Her need to call you mom by stomping on your boundaries is what ruined the relationship.", "NTA. Although they have both married into your family, the relationship is much different. To continue to call someone a name they have asked you not to is grossly disrespectful. Cat is picking a fight for no good reason.", "NTA you don\u2019t feel comfortable with people calling you mom and that\u2019s okay. Even your own grandkids call you by your name. What make cat think she\u2019s so special to call you something that makes you uncomfortable and that your own grandkids don\u2019t? She\u2019s a entitled rude brat and she should apologise and go have her tantrum somewhere else", "YTA\n\n1.  You equate love with money.

You\u2019re uncomfortable with anyone calling you any name but you\u2019re given first name, but Edna is somehow exempt from this? Let\u2019s call a spade a spade.

You don\u2019t want to be called Mom. I get it. But you\u2019re not listening when Cat tells you that she can\u2019t call you by your first name. And boy howdy do I get that. I\u2019ve known my MIL and FIL for 30 years. I go out of my way in all scenarios to avoid using their names at all. I can\u2019t call them by their first names. I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s not how I was raised. But I refuse to call them Mr and Mrs. And Mom and Dad doesn\u2019t feel right either. So I just don\u2019t call them anything. Cat probably feels more comfortable carving out her own tongue than calling you by your first name. And just like she should respect that you don\u2019t wish to be called Mom. You should respect that she can\u2019t use your first name. So use some sort of nickname or pet name or even a joke name. My brother to this day calls my mom \u201chey lady\u201d after she got frustrated one time when we were kids and said \u201cstop saying mom!  I\u2019m not mom anymore!\u201d It\u2019s cute now and their little inside joke. Maybe Cat could call you \u201cnot mom\u201d or \u201cMama Your Name.\u201d Just find a name you can both live with and move on to things that actually matter. And hey; it could be worse.

This is one hell of a hill you built to die on due to poor communication and, whether you meant to or not, you created this situation and you need to fix it.\n\nBy all means, keep that boundary if you feel the need to, but explain to her exactly why you would prefer it that way and for the love of all that is fucking holy, do NOT make it sound conditional if that's truly not the case.", "Yup, YTA.

It might be that Cat was raised in an environment where referring to the MIL as \u2018mom\u2019 was the norm and if you\u2019ve been around that for 30+ years it can be difficult to switch off. Particularly if your experience of that is your own mother referring to your paternal grandparents in such terms because it\u2019s a copy of that situation. \n\n100% Cat should respect the wish to not be called \u2018Mom\u2019 but it is also a fair assessment that by allowing the other DIL to use the term and not her, OP is putting her in a separate category to the other DIL. Sure, there\u2019s a reason why that is the case (that is reasonable), but OP should not just ignore Cat\u2019s feelings and the fact that she is clearly out of her own comfort zone in not using the term. It isn\u2019t mentioned here, but do we know what Sam refers to his MIL as?", "Look for you maybe your monetary contribution is a sign of affection.  For me in that type of scenario I'd seriously have to question why you are throwing money at me.  But I grew up with a mom who used money to \" bribe and buy love\".  She never apologized, but if she thought you felt some kind of negative way she'd find a way to spend a ridiculous sum of money on you suddenly. \n\nThe financial contributions you made to her life are so generous that If it was me, I'd feel indebted, on egg shells waiting for the other shoe to drop, and like I was being bought off. \n\nAnd honestly, I don't know why you couldn't come up with a compromise to address this before it got so emotionally charged.  It seems like Cat has brought this up to you more than once. You say you like her and have things you bond over.   Did it not occur to you to find a middle ground? I feel like a simple opening could be, Cat it seems like calling me mom holds some kind of meaning, can you elaborate on why it's so important to you?  If she says, well Edna calls you that, redirect and say yes I've explained to you why she does and why I am more comfortable with the limited usage of the word with Edna.  But Mom is a title and sometimes a term of endearment.  I personally feel that it's inappropriate for you to refer to me as mom when you have a mother who you have a relationship with.  You calling me mom feels disrespectful to your mother.  \n\nThen you could end with a compromise, Cat it seems you are under the impression that using the word mom when you refer to me will foster a stronger bond between us. But it will only make me feel uncomfortable if you insist on trying to do that. I am entitled to my feelings and you don't have to understand it but I need you to respect my request that you do not call me mom. However, maybe we can find another term of endearment for each other. \n\nYou both should be allowed to feel upset and hurt over this. But it seems a shame to throw away a relationship with her, your son, and your grand kids. She is certainly coming across as bratty and entitled, but that could be frustration causing her to make a wild disjointed argument to prove her point. It sounds like some of the complaints Cat has are easy to address. Like the why don't you baby sit or spend more time with the grand kids issue, you obviously love them if you put out that kind of money for daycare/ education. But when she brings up that issue, why are you not able to fix the transportation and bedding arrangements? Not too be rude but if you are putting that much money into their house hold, perhaps you could suggest reallocating some of the money into setting up a guest bed for you. Even put some of that money aside to allow you to fly to them a few times a year.  If she isn't willing to do that, then you not being able to visit is on her.  \n\nBest of luck", "Yeah there's  a difference if Op had said, \"I've spent so much money on you so you don't get to feel isolated\"  which is far from, \"I've been involved with your life since you met my son\" the transactional statement is a reach", "This.  People have a right to be called what they want to be called, so long as the expectation is not claiming an honor from someone else.  \n\nIf OP does not want to be called Mom because she feels like that title belongs to someone else, she needs to say it like that to Sam.", "In further conversation, sure.

And that\u2019s fine, maybe there\u2019s more.\n\nBut I personally think going out of your way to bring the issue up to a bunch of strangers to receive an asshole judgment over something so utterly petty (on both sides) is also why social relationships suck. It\u2019s a dynamic that creates divides in relationships and what exactly I changed by that?", "I'm sure from Cat's point of view, OP has a favorite DIL, Edna. To Cat she thinks that Cat and Edna should be equal because they are both DIL. \n\nBut what Cat is failing to understand/ignores is that Edna and OP do no just have a regular MIL/DIL relationship they have an actual mother/daughter relationship. \n\nSo of course Edna/OP are much much closer the way a daughter would be, but Edna also happens to be a DIL also. \n\nCat might see it as OP playing favorites and being closer with Edna, that is likely true, but that is because of the daughter relationship not the DIL relationship.\n\nWhat Cat wants/is trying to force is really insisting that OP treat Cat with the full history/background of a daughter. \n\nImagine if a DIL came into the picture and wanted to force herself into the MIL relationship with a blood daughter, insisted on always tagging along and not wanting them to have any one on one daughter/mother time, and expecting that MIL has to treat them both the same. That would be unhinged, that is really what Cat is doing/asking.", "I let people I love call me as I please, frequently as they please. I, and nobody else, ought to let some newcomer call me by any name other that the one I see fit.  That is perfect consistency. If you can't bare to call my how I chose,  why should I extend my love to you (for \"democracy\")? You cannot carve a place in someone's heart with a knife,  no matter how hard you try", "Agreed. OP is stuck on \u201cothering\u201d Cat for whatever reason. She feels connected to Edna since she helped her grow up. Ok. That\u2019s fine and understandable. Edna calls her mom \u201con occasion\u201d and OP is ok with it. I bet Cat tried to call OP \u201cmom\u201d only once or twice before OP made it a point to tell her that she can\u2019t call her \u201cmom:\u201d At that point in time, Cat was being rejected. OP may not see it that way but that\u2019s what her actions have done - led to an \u201cothering\u201d in the family. \n\nCat calling OP \u201cmom\u201d after every sentence was probably the action of a frustrated and hurt individual. It doesn\u2019t matter what else OP does \u201cfor\u201d that side of the family, being the only individual on that \u201clevel\u201d of the family not allowed to call OP \u201cmom\u201d is absolutely going to hurt Edna. \n\nAlso, OP makes it a point to say that her grandkids don\u2019t even call her \u201cgrandma\u201d? Aren\u2019t Sam and Cat the only couple to have kids or am I messing that up? If Cat has the only grandkids, and they can\u2019t even call OP \u201cgrandma\u201d or the equivalent, the. OP is probably seen further rejecting the Sam and Cat side. What Cat see is that OP is rejecting her and, even worse, rejecting her kids. And Ed and Edna don\u2019t have any children to show Cat that the grandkids are on an even playing field. All Caf sees is OP rejecting her AND rejecting her children. I bet that hurts even more.\n\nOP then responded by throwing everything she pays for into the ring. It\u2019s like \u201cbe happy with what I give you!!!\u201d Let\u2019s be honest, it sounds like OP threw this in Cat\u2019s face. And if Sam and Cat are the only couple with children then there is no way to see if they are being treated equally. So once again, it comes down to \u2018Cat and the kids seem like they are being rejected.\u201d Paying for the kid\u2019s things also feels transactional, from OP. She was quick to pull that information out. And that money can also be used as a carrot or a stick. \u201cI\u2019ll keep paying it if you do x, y, and z.\u201d Or OP can threatened to take the money away.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Cat and therefore Sam is being hurt by what seems like a double standard. Regardless of the reason for Edna being able to call OP \u201cmom\u201d while Cat can\u2019t, it\u2019s going to be seen as rejection by Cat. Edna even gets monthly pedicures. Has OP attempted to do any bonding with Cat or does Edna get all of the special \u201cnot daughter\u201d attention. OP seemed to use the pedicures as a way to say \u201cEdna has been in my life for a long time!!\u201d  What Cat might see is yet another method of playing favorites. \n\nOP should also look at this from the perspective of how much this is hurting one part of the family and want to alleviate the pain she is causing. No matter what logic Cat may have been told about the situation, not being able to call OP \u201cmom\u201d while everyone else can is going to hurt on an instinctual level. It would be a small to medium sign of acceptance and a way for OP\u2019s to say she accepts and loves Cat to let Cat call her \u201cmom.\u201d Instead, OP wants to dig in her heels and continue to hurt Cat and Sam. So for that reason I\u2019m going to say OP, YTA.", "OP and all people involved are adults, not small children. Talking about \"favorites\" with people in your life past the age of 18 is pathetic. You're allowed to have favorite people regardles of who they are, including blood family, much less in-laws. \n\nObviously the DIL you've known for 20 years and live near is going to be closer to you than one you barely knew before the wedding and rarely see. Cat's an adult and knows full well that Edna and her situation aren't the same, as well as the basic fact of life that we don't all get along the same. \n\nCat isn't excluded from anything and is even invited to their mother-daughter spa trips that precluded anyone being a DIL, her MIL that she only sees on Xmas and Thanksgiving not wanting her to call her mom is not the end of the world for a mentally well person. Cat's a drama queen that doesn't respect boundaries, slinging insults and threatening to not \"let\" her husband see his family and playing keep-away with children because she isn't getting her petty way. \n\nIn any other post everyone would be acknowledging this abusive behavior, but the OP is a MIL so she's ofc the evil one that's secretly scheming against her DIL and DIL's behavior is justified actually because she was pushed to her limit by evil MIL's abuse! I've read so many other stories where that's the case so it must always be true!\n\nNTA", "You think your stepmom thinking about you fucking your little brother is normal?", "I think you actually just proved my point even more. Lmao. She IS NOT her daughter. Edna has no blood relation to OP. Edna did not live with them. Edna was raised in another house, and most importantly, EDNA IS NOT HER DAUGHTER. \n\nWhat I'm about to say is only speculation, and maybe OP can explain, but people generally change names here to keep anonymity. It's quite telling that her eldest son and wife were named Ed and EDna, and her other son and wife are just Sam and Cat. Like Edna is only an extension of Ed. OP also called her daughter-in-law, her daughter. Even her grandchildren don't call her grandma. So it's ok for OP to call Cat her daughter, but it's not OK for Cat to call her mom. When truthfully, OP is Cat's MOTHER-in-law.", "Cat lives 6 hours away.  How much kitchen bonding can they do?", "\ud83d\ude02 this response is just too funny", "Well, she doesn\u2019t like the grandkids to call her \u201cgrandma\u201d or the equivalent either.  But wait, these are Cat and Sam\u2019s kids. So three people can call her mom. But Cat can\u2019t call her \u2018mom\u2019 and Cat\u2019s kids can\u2019t call her \u2018Grandma\u2019\u2026\n\nBut it\u2019s okay since OP *lets* Cat join in on *OP and Edna\u2019s* monthly pedicure on occasion.

It's weird to do it here too although the younger generations are doing it more.", "This is interesting! Love learning things like that. Quick Q tho, what do twins do? Is the younger twin expected to use the terms for their older twin? Or is there a different word for same aged siblings?", "Thank you. The Uncle/Aunt thing is similar here for the parents' friends who are not blood related but have a close relationship with the kid.\n\nI was once called \"Auntie\" by my kid's friend and schoolmate, and felt honored :)", "Don't forget Cat is also mad that OP is not babysitting for them but is puppy sitting for Edna. As if the 6 hour 1 way drive with no guest accommodations vs living 4 doors down has no bearing.", "And who the fuck told OP that life is fair? So her DIL calls her mom. Wahhh I don't get what I want, that's not fair.\n\nEdit: To be clear, I think DIL needs to stop calling her \"Mom,\" but it's absurd to make this about if life is fair or not. It's two people consciously choosing their actions, not \"life.\" Thinking your MIL isn't being fair is not remotely the same as thinking the cosmos should align to give you what you want.", "The kind that doesn't make their grandkids call them by their first name lmao.", "Why is Cat wearing Your wedding dress?", "My memaw used to yell at us if we even dared call her \u201cgrandma\u201d or anything like it because it made her feel \u201cold\u201d. It just made us grandkids feel like she didn\u2019t want to be our grandma.", "Probably because you're so resistant to it and she wanted to piss you off. Even your grandkids use your first name? That is a weird hangup you have over your name.", "Isn't the entire AITA sub judged by how people would feel in a certain situation? The whole 'is someone an asshole or not' debate is entirely subjective... Based on how people feel. Obviously people have different opinions on what constitutes an asshole. Yours clearly differ from mine. Also, I can't really understand your sentence... I'm sure you're trying to make a point, I just don't know what it is but I've tried my best to answer you regardless.", "I agree with everything you\u2019re saying. This would\u2019ve been resolved if the OP sat Cat down and talked to her openly. Clearly Cat wants to be close to her and wants to establish a connection, but she feels rejected by the OP. The OP can think she doesn\u2019t play favourites all she wants, she is. And yes, they are both adults,  but I\u2019m looking at this from the perspective of someone who is entering a new family and she\u2019s the only one that is seen as \u201cthe outsider\u201d because Edna is deemed as a \u201cdaughter\u201d not \u201cDIL\u201d. And the \u201cdon\u2019t call me mom\u201d thing when Edna can, even if it\u2019s occasional, further reinforces that. And add the throwing in finances in her face\u2026 Yes they are both adults, but the OP is the older one and the one whose acceptance is being craved, not the other way around. Bringing up that she has a mom but Edna doesn\u2019t, as if the OP being warmer to Edna and not to Cat is justified that way - is it not possible to want to have two parent figures/a close relationship with another adult? I bet if the OP made an effort to make Cat feel included and appreciated, this mom thing wouldn\u2019t have been this much of an issue. Feels like it became a sore spot for Cat and she\u2019s dying on that hill because it\u2019s giving her something to take a stance on. I don\u2019t understand how the NTA people can\u2019t see all of this. Money is appreciated, help with finances are certainly nice, but it doesn\u2019t make up for the lack of relationship. If that was the case, rich people would have the best families.", "What is pathetic is having favourites, not talking about them.\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yes, this is the human condition, we always see our side of it more clearly. This is why we practice empathy- even if we don\u2019t feel the way the other person feels, if that person matters to  us, we\u2019d make an effort to find solutions or meet in the middle, which the OP hasn\u2019t done. Which is actually a sign for why I strongly believe she is purposefully othering Cat (even if she might not be aware of it). Intent becomes irrelevant at that point - you have to look at the consequences of your actions, communicate with the person you hurt, and resolve things. \n\nI bet if this was Edna, the OP would\u2019ve compromised in 374947 ways already.", "\"EDNA IS NOT HER DAUGHTER.\" \n\nNot biologically no, and OP did not raise her the same way as if they had fully adopted Edna. But feeling like Edna is like a daughter because OP has known her most (entire?) life and Edna was over a lot of traveled with them is not unusual. \n\nOP has known Edna for most of Edna's life guessing 15/20 years or more, but Cat has more recently come into the picture. Cat can't expect the same closeness, that was built over years.", "But there is a difference between not liking someone, liking someone and liking someone more. \n\nLiking someone more than another person or being close does not mean you don't like the other person. \n\nI have friends, and I have close/best friends.

It puts a different perspective on it when she didn\u2019t start to call you mom until then. Maybe you have different feelings for her, and allowed it, but it\u2019s really no different than anyone else starting to call you mom when they start to date your child, just like your other daughter in law. \n\nMy other question is about lodging if you go to visit them.

The freaking audacity.", "But my problem here is that before it even got to this level, OP HAD spoken with both of them before, Cat just doesn't care and feels like she can call OP whatever she wants and OP should accept that.

Calling her a bitch though is way out of line. It\u2019s one thing to have hurt feelings, but to call OP that is another. That\u2019s crossing a line, even if OP had done nothing for them. It would have been better to just say that she doesn\u2019t like being called mom by anyone, but allows DIL to (infrequently at that) because she raised her.

I think driving 6 hours might be too much for an elderly person, more so for someone who doesn't drive well.", "And she will forever be excluded from feeling like family because she is the only one who has been told not to call her mom.\n\nMy guess is that the \u201cone off\u201d part of OPs post has never been said to Cat.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like OP thinks the relationship needs any work, and she has essentially told Cat that her feelings of exclusion are invalid.", "All of that also benefits OP's son.  There are lots of things someone might do to help their adult child have a more stable financial situation that have nothing to do with loving or even wanting to tolerate the adult child's spouse.\n\nMy mother is straight up *nasty* to her MIL.  She still does nice things for her occasionally, because my mom knows that not doing those things would hurt my dad.  That doesn't stop my mother from absolutely hating the woman.\n\nOP is dealing with a DIL who feels like she is only an accessory to a family member, not a member of the family herself.  Throwing money at that relationship won't fix anything.  It will be just another sign that OP loves her son.  Talking to Cat regularly might help.\n\nIt's normal for OP to initially have a stronger bond with the woman she's known longer, but in order to grow a relationship with Cat, both of them have to put in the effort.  The grass is greener where it is watered, and relationships grow when they are tended to regularly.", "Being told mil didn\u2019t like Cat calling her mom, then doubling down on it starting & ending all her sentences with \u2019mom\u2019 is spiteful and pot stirring to drag the husband in & force him to be in the middle of wife & mother. Cat is clearly the AH.", "She also includes Cat in her spa days with Edna and has bonded over cooking so clearly her support and welcoming hasn't even been limited to financial!", "I think it\u2019s a little unfair to be acting like DIL was really a factor into the house thing though. All of the things while benefiting DIL really also benefits OPs son. Other then the spa trips. I think that DILs feelings are valid and OP really missed the mark on actually making her feel special. It\u2019s ok for her to feel unloved and like an outcast in a family that\u2019s so close. ESH - Op all you did was reaffirm her feelings. While yes she seems a little annoying it really doesn\u2019t kill you to let her call you mom. Maybe go to therapy to figure out why you feel the way you do about it. The only people I\u2019ve seen who aren\u2019t referred to mom as a MIL are the same people who get posted as horror stories.", "This is a very crucial point. I can think of several examples that are incredibly discriminatory but can also be established as \u201cboundaries\u201d. But also, you can even say \u201chell, yes I\u2019m treating her differently, but this is the boundary I want to establish and I have a right to it\u201d. I\u2019d take that honesty over what the OP is doing, which is pretending that this is not what she is doing, like she\u2019s all innocent and nice and all she wants is to not be called mom, etc etc.", "I would love an in law who hates me this much \ud83d\ude02\n\nI guess I'm just not that family oriented or something, because I don't understand caring about whether my in laws love me enough at all. As long as we get along well enough to have pleasant visits and they aren't overbearing or controlling, that sounds like a win. If they want to give me money, even better!", "You're allowed to do things that still make you an AH. I mean, I can insist that my daughter not call me dad, but I'd be an AH. The reason wouldn't matter, because it would be my problem, not her's.  And if my daughter marries, and has a husband, I can give him attitude for calling me dad, but I'd be an AH.\n\nSometimes there are just really awful majority opinions you see here on AITA threads, and this is one of those threads. Just kinda makes me lose hope on people sometimes.", "Just because she said she helped pay those things doesn\u2019t make it the truth. I take things like that with a grain of salt. I know of mils that make up crap they paid for to try and look good to others who don\u2019t know better.", "This is the best answer here.", "Love bombing comes to mind. Emotional abusers/financial abusers use gifts/money all the time to control, demand, and/or manipulate. Not saying it is this situation, as I don't know any of the people in the written scenario. You also made me think of Love Languages. Maybe giving \"gifts\" isn't the DILs love language. That would create a massive emotional disconnect.", "I understood it as... Say, they had to each put 10k towards the down-payment, Cat only had 6k, so OP gave her the other 4k. Whether or not OP also gave the son money is irrelevant, but in the event of divorce, Cat would still have her 50% share of the house thanks to OP's gift.", "Yes I believe this is a feeling old thing. Not wanting to be called Mom or Grandma.", "Yep. OP is isolating herself from her family with this weird hill. Those grand kids are going to see other families interacting and wonder why they don\u2019t get that at home too.", "This. That person is right, you are allowed to have favorites. You are also allowed to be an AH, which having clear favorites in the family makes you.", "Why is it pathetic to have favorites? Everyone has favorites. You can't love everyone equally.  So everyone is your best friend? And everyone is your SO? Wtf?", "Exactly. Edna is a daughter when it\u2019s convenient (being called mom) but not when it is inconvenient (marrying her son)", "Ah, thank you for the clarification.", "I just don't think her not wanting to be called mom and expressing it mutiple times, with reasons why warrants being called a bitch. I believe the money does matter, maybe she didn't need to bring it up, but it is proof that she cares enough about her to do these things. I could never imagine my MIL paying for my student loans, not because she's awful, she's quite amazing, but because it's just not something normally done. I would never call someone a bitch for not wanting to continuously be called something that makes them uncomfortable. The DIL should have enough respect to not say it in every single sentence, and enough respect to stop when OP expressed it, again, mutiple times. Maybe there is more to the story but from the information given. I see a DIL that is completely disrespecting someone who has seemingly only tried to help her.", "That would annoy the heck out of me.  When my kids were younger, my son went through a phase of \"mom, mom, mom.\"   She is an adult and purposely using that word in an annoying way", "You need to know more shitty people", "Right. That is insane to me to calm that creepy. I call my best friend\u2019s mother mom because she has been apart of my life for 30+ years and is a family member to me at this point.  While OP is allowed her perspectives, it\u2019s odd that they are so hung up on being called mom that she is willing to damage relationships for it.", "I'm not a hugger. My love language is giving gifts. Yes people like us exist. People don't need to be the same as you. What's important is we respect each other's boundaries. RECOGNIZE AND RESPECT THAT SOME PEOPLE AREN'T THE SAME AS YOU, and have no obligation to be like you.\n\nETA: I get along well with people and don't ruin family gatherings, or any gathering, for that matter.", "Not to mention the fact that she also doesn't want her grandkids to call her grandma, very weird that you would expect your grandkids to call you by your first name.", "Yes, because the OP is a delight.", "That part was stunning to me as well. I have never seen a grandparent that wanted to maintain that distance from grandkids."]}
