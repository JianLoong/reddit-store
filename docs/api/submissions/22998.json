I can understand your preference to have down time at home during long weekends - you\u2019re away from home working normally, and it sounds like you value that down time. I can equally understand your wife\u2019s desire to go away during long weekends.

I can do things like, clean out the shed, throw out some clutter, shop for insurance...perhaps make something special in the kitchen. I can actually get the smallest one to participate in their own way. I am not talking painting the house or major house projects...just anything that is tough to get done when you are working till 5ish PM and then with the fam till you are tired or its too dark.

Or did they only take days off during the fall/winter/spring and do everything while you were at school?\n\nNTA by the way. Sometimes you need just a relaxing weekend at home, sometimes you need to get things done at home. Don\u2019t feel bad for that.", "Incompatible people imo. Wife thinks every extended weekend should be for events and doin shit you wouldn't normally do. OP just sees it as just a weekend with one extra day.\n\nFor the record I'm like OP's wife. Every weekend I will go on a little trip and stay at a hotel here in Minnesota unless I have something preplanned.

A staycation, but a real staycation where she doesn't have to cook, you go to restaurants or get take out. You visit local sites, or just lounge around in your backyard. A relaxing weekend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf that works out, go from there and maybe you can get your project weekend at a later date.", "I have an advice - op get your wife to get a job.

I actually said this today to her-it then came to her other gripe \"I want to go on trips w other families more\". In other words, she said yes to the planning ahead of time, except it depends on if we can travel w another family.", "I do 90% of the cooking and cleaning in this house. She was like this when employed.", "Why can\u2019t you clean out the shed on a Saturday, or at least start it?  Cook a Saturday or Sunday dinner with the kids?    When our kids were little, we did the housework, clean the shed, mow the lawn the work that needs to be done and caught up on, in the mornings on the weekend so we could do the fun things on the weekend.  \n\nHave you talked with your wife why she wants to go to all these places?  Can you compromise, take a day trip?", "What DOES she do?", "Believe me, I've tried to set the example of getting things done early before going out those days, but that likely bump up against an early kids sports thing, Sunday art class, or a \"funbligation\".\nShe wants to go somewhere all the time because it cheers her up and she does not have to be home to deal with real stuff internally and externally.\nWe have taken trips and on some trips, I have negotiated earlier return home.", "NTA, it's not to much to ask for. Some times a vacation or home cleaning can do a lot for mental health. I personally hate cleaning but make time on a long weekend not to feel rushed and get things in order.

She will find something to complain about no matter what, might as well have a weekend you enjoy.", "NTA travelling very long weekend is exhausting. I think it\u2019s fair to find some middle ground. Some long weekends to travel, some long weekends to stay home (whether that be you alone, or you and the kids or you and one kid). She should respect how you\u2019re feeling, as long as you respect hers and work towards a compromise", "NTA", "This is it. I've had both and I think a lot of families with children know this problem: the washer/dryer/food/dishwasher rinse repeat groundhog day feeling where I would give anything to see anything beside home, supermarket and the local playground and the work the full week I just want to putter around the house and play lego with my kids feeling.\nFor my parents it was my mum (service industry) coming home not wanting to talk to anyone anymore vs my dad (rather solidary office worker) ready to finally get some human contact.\n\nOP, at the moment you and your wife lead very different lives during the day and have varying needs on the weekend. NAH, go and talk again. Tell her how you feel, validate her feelings, try to figure out what each of you is missing exactly and what solutions could be.\n\nIf that's hard to figure out, couples counselling is perfect for talks like that!", "She has been working on it...I see it, I am surprised she has not found anything. She is not a tech type and only having a bachelor's in this area can make it rough. I think she would still want to travel or get away as she often says she is tired during activities.", "NTA.  People who don't work don't have a clear understanding of the time constraints of people who do.  You can certainly do things as a family without piling into the car for hours and hours of driving.

Not a dig to SAHM but her duties are largely the same be it a weekday or a weekend or if you're home or on the road.\n\nI, personally, need a day to recharge before I hit the workweek.  It's to the point where I will take a Monday off if I come back on a Sunday.  My sister is different, she figures she can fly in on Sunday at 10pm and suck it up for Monday.  \n\nI imagine for a long weekend you do chores Saturday and Sunday and take your Monday off to recharge.  It's what I would do.  \n\nI think maybe you do long weekend trips when you can add a day off after you get back.  So if you leave Friday night and get back Monday take the Tuesday off. \n\nOnly do the vacations when you can do that.", "NTA, you just want different things.  You want to be home & get things done & she thinks you should travel for every holiday weekend.  You need to communicate to her that you can't continue to travel for every holiday bc the house needs tending to & bc you just don't feel like going through the hassle.    Sometimes ppl just need to have a staycation.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to get a job, that's why she's bored at home and can't stay there on long weekends. Get her out of the house with a job, and she will appreciate being in the house more.", "Has she been trying hard enough? I know it can be difficult but there ARE jobs out there and if it's been a while and there's not even Interviews being set up I would begin to question things. I know I am TERRIBLE at applying for jobs which is why I employ help from those who are good at it. I offer I return to help with some ting I am GOOD at in return for the help or I flat out pay for it from a professional."]}
