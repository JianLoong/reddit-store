Take off some random Fridays and Mondays and just spend time with her.", "NAH. I can understand your preference to have down time at home during long weekends - you\u2019re away from home working normally, and it sounds like you value that down time. I can equally understand your wife\u2019s desire to go away during long weekends. I\u2019ve had times when I didn\u2019t work and stayed home with the kids - during those times the last thing I wanted to do on a long weekend was stay home with the kids some more.\n\nWe split the difference - traveling for some holidays and for the others staying home but planning local outings for 1 or 2 of the days so that it doesn\u2019t feel like groundhog day.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wife thinks every extended weekend should be for events and doin shit you wouldn't normally do. OP just sees it as just a weekend with one extra day.\n\nFor the record I'm like OP's wife.
