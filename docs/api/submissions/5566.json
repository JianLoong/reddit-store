As I understand it, they never really did Christmas. Like they did when they were little kids but it evaporated by the time they were in their teens (husband has one brother 2 years older).\u00a0\n\nSo, as adults, even though we live nearby, we've always done Christmas solo. Part of this is that my husband and BIL aren't particularly close to their dad (mom passed away 10 years ago). So we only visit occasionally. Another part, for me anyways, is that we always do Thanksgiving together. I became defacto in charge and it's always a fucking slog. FIL relishes getting under my skin, Thanksgiving is his day to shine in that regard. So I've never been keen on doing round 2 a month later.\u00a0\n\nHusband and I have been together 13 years and have never done Christmas with his family. Period.\u00a0\n\nMy family decides they want to do Christmas together this year. Mom, dad, their spouses (who are all close), my sister and her family. They want to do it here, which is sweet because it's far but they've only visited a couple times and with me being pregnant AF they realized there might not be a good opportunity again for some time.\u00a0\n\nSo they're here. My sister posts a picture of us doing Christmas stuff together. FIL sees this and calls my husband. This, in and of itself wasn't unusual. The call. They're chatting, husband mentions what we're up to, and FIL gets PISSED. Like I can't hear what he's saying but I can hear the Charlie Brown yelling coming from his dad.\u00a0\n\nHusband hangs up - we exchange a look and that's it. I didn't even think of inviting FIL because, again, we NEVER DO CHRISTMAS WITH HIM. EVER. But even if it had crossed my mind I would NOT want him here. He's met my family once, at our wedding, and was cartoonishly rude and offensive to my family. Both my stepparents are POC. My FIL thinks comedy peaked in the 70s. I'll leave it there.\n\nBut FIL posts some pissy bullshit on Facebook (like a fucking baby) and suddenly we're getting inundated with texts from folks pressuring us to invite him for tomorrow. BIL who, by the way, is in Florida with his wife's family, is putting the most heat on us. That this might be his \"last christmas\" (true, his health is poor) and that we're terrible people for not inviting him in the first place and something about \"christmas spirit.\"\u00a0\n\nHusband is hard no. He hates having to manage his dad in public settings. His coarse, offensive bullshit is a defining feature. To be entirely honest, I don't know if I'll ever have all my family together like this again. I want to be able to enjoy it. If we invite FIL he's just going to make it horribly awkward. I'm also pregnant, hormonal, and FIL has taken to nagging me about that and I will likely lose my cool entirely. He didn't even think or say anything about Christmas until he felt like he was being left out.\u00a0\n\nAITA?\u00a0", "created_utc": 1671912711, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuhpwr/aita_for_not_inviting_fil_to_christmas_with_my/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell anyone who says that you should be inviting him that since they feel so strongly about him spending Christmas with someone you'll be telling him that they've invited him over. I bet no one else wants him either and that'll shut them up pretty quick. If they don't want to invite him they can't criticize you for not inviting him either.", "NTA \n\nY\u2019all don\u2019t do Christmas with him, he has a rocky relationship with your husband and from what you say he\u2019s an asshole. Don\u2019t ruin your holiday by inviting him. The BIL didn\u2019t lift a finger to invite his father to Florida for Christmas since it might be his last. It\u2019s hilarious that he\u2019s trying to guilt trip his brother into inviting that man. The lesson here is don\u2019t be an asshole to your kid and then when they become adults they won\u2019t exclude you from their life.", "i second that", "Right? I definitely called him out for being a hypocrite but his response was \"well we do this every year\" so... you've had multiple opportunities then?", "Eh that's a separate story for sure. I'm in it for the food tbh. There are folks from his side of the family that go that are actually really awesome and we wouldn't see otherwise. \n\nHusband doesn't let him steamroll me, he's definitely called his dad out but FIL feeds off of it. Its all really... banal. Like arguing, every year, about how to use a meat thermometer or cut an onion. Folks tell him to knock it off he just can't help himself. \n\nSo yes, super annoying but manageable and it's not like anyone thinks he's in the right. Worth it to stay connected to the extended family who didn't get the asshole gene.", "In retrospect \"AWTA\" would have been appropriate phrasing. As I saw it his \"hard no\" was more about bypassing any guilt I might have.", "[removed]", "Ah, thanks for the context. Still NTA. For both of you. Enjoy Christmas with your family.", "I mean he does cook, he just doesn't on Thanksgiving because that would take him away from his favorite sport, being a dick. \n\nBetter yet is that I was a sous chef for like 6 years in one of the fancy restaurants in town (where I met his son) so if anyone would know, it would be me. \n\nWhich is also why I kinda ended up doing it all - not even that I'm better at making the end product he, and everyone else in attendance, do NOT understand timing, pacing, or prep at all. It was like the third Thanksgiving where we didn't sit down until 9pm that I was like \"alright, maybe I should steer this ship next year\" and then that just became me doing it all. \n\nHonestly it's fine but it is very telling of his personality. I enjoy cooking, so I can only halfway complain. But I also know myself well enough to stay out of the way when anyone else is cooking anything because I 1000% have opinions and 1000% have the grace to know no one wants to hear them unless they ask for help or guidance. Because it's rude.", "It sounds like you prefer to do the cooking, so it\u2019s not fair to complain about that. But like I said, don\u2019t argue with him. Stupid to engage with somebody when you are in control of the situation.\n\nHe\u2019s never going to admit that you are right, so it\u2019s banging your head against the wall if you keep trying to get him to do so.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t even invite him to Thanksgiving based on what you put here.", "NTA. It's husband's dad. He doesn't want him at Christmas. Those who want your FIl's company are welcome to him", "NTA, hard stop. If he wanted \"his last Christmas\" to be spent with family, maybe he shouldn't have spent the some-odd fifty of them being a complete jackass. If your BIL wants to deal with his familial guilt, then he can do it when he gets back from Florida. His emotions are not your problem.", "NTA. But be prepared for FIL to show up at the door tomorrow.", "This exactly. I love my Dad, but my brother and I agree that if he ends up dying alone and no one even knows for a week or so it will be entirely due to HIS life choices and insistence on being a dedicated misanthrope with superfun racist highlights.", "NTA. If you wanted to be nice you could send hubby over there w a wrapped up plate of xmas dinner and a card. But FiL sounds horrible so I wouldn't even bother. He can't expect to be horrible his whole life and still get everything on his time", "NTA, sounds like FIL has spent *years* investing in this very moment. Now it\u2019s here, he doesn\u2019t want it? Lol, he\u2019ll use this to justify his (it was gonna happen anyway) continued bad behaviour.\n\nMerry Christmas to you and yours, enjoy!", "Nope NTA Don't invite him. Merry Christmas!", "NTA if someone is choosing to be unpleasant, they might not accept it, but they will eventually experience the consequences to that choice. You are allowed to choose your happiness and not service the pleasure of someone who doesn't care about yours. Your brother-in-law doesn't get to decide who is invited to your house. If he wants his father with someone for christmas, he better step up.", "Also as usual with the peanut gallery- if BIL thinks this is so important, why did he not take dad on HIS vacation with HIS FAMILY for CHRISTMAS? He us jut trying to alleviate his own misplaced guilt.  NTA. No one should have to manage a racist bigot (strongly implied by the OP) over the holidays.  No matter if they share blood or whatever.", "Motion passed.\n\n(Smacks gavel).", "And so do you! You never spend Christmas with him why the fuck should you now? Especially someone who has shown his ass repeatedly in front of you and I can\u2019t imagine how horrid he\u2019d be with your POC step parents. \n\nNTA. He\u2019s not your problem. Mute your phones and call it a day/holiday.", "Yikes! I'm so sorry. You can't help who you were related to, but you can choose what to do with it. As someone with a *very* small blood family...blood doesn't mean shit in the end."]}
