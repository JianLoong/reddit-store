Holding my few items, I made my way over to the express checkout lane. The guy in front of me (we had just about arrived the same time) got out of line and I moved up.   \n\n\nSeveral moment shortly after, he returned to line (having gotten the item he forgot or having failed to find a faster line), with a huff. At first, he was standing normally in line (that was now wrapping around a display table to avoid blocking foot traffic). Then he moved and he was right behind me. I mean, RIGHT behind me. Goodbye personal bubble haha.\n\nI have PTSD and an anxiety disorder and I was very uncomfortable with him being practically on top of me (presumably from his impatience with the long line). I had also just done a very stressful 2 hour drive that already had me feeling anxious. So, for the first time ever when someone's stood too close to me in line, I spoke up.   \n\n\nI turned to him and asked him if he could take a step back. He said \"no\". I added the explanation that I have PTSD (I do take medication and get help, BTW) and that I would like him to not be that close. This lead to a few quick snips at each other on both our parts about how I asked nicely, he wasn't a mind reader, etc. \n\nThe line started moving at that point, as the person that had been in front, grabbed their paid-for items and headed out. As I moving forward with the line, I could have sworn I heard the guy behind the too-close guy behind me say, \"Shouldn't be in a grocery line then\"...Like I shouldn't be in a line if I have those issues and don't like people being too close (which is rarely the case, by the way haha). \n\nI barely made it out the door before breaking down. Tears, hyperventilating...Full-on anxiety attack. It was hard enough for him to be that close and even harder to speak up for my boundaries. And I was very hurt by why the other guy said about me. I wasn't trying to be a jerk. I was just so taken by surprise at the whole thing. And I'm not really comfortable with confrontation. \n\nSo, anyway, AITA for advocating for myself and asking the guy to take a step back because he was literally right behind me?  Does the guy that said I should \"not be in a grocery line\" have a point? Or do you think it was okay to ask him to take a step back?   \n\n\nI'm open to hearing your thoughts, but I'm still really sensitive and feel like I got hit by an emotional truck after my anxiety attack yesterday. So, whatever your verdict, I just ask that you say it with sensitivity haha. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1689848669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154n3r3/aita_for_asking_a_guy_to_take_a_step_back/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially since the pandemic, I do this all the time, and people are usually completely reasonable about it. \n\nHonestly, especially if you\u2019re a guy making a woman uncomfortable, be polite, we\u2019re usually a lot smaller than you and we may feel intimidated and uncomfortable. If someone asks you to step out of their personal space and your response is to get upset, I\u2019m now even more uncomfortable because you have zero respect for boundaries. What a strange response. If someone asked me to back up a bit my response would be \u201cof course, no problem.\u201d How hard is that?", "NTA\n\nThat person violated your personal space and made you feel uncomfortable.

Unless the store was packed and there literally was no room, you are fair to ask.", "I am very sorry that happened to you. I hope you can start to feel more comfortable out in public.

Some people have no concept of personal space. Your guy left the line without asking you to hold his spot. Considering he got right back in line directly behind you he was just pissy. It really had nothing to do with you at all.", "Nta but people don't owe you anything because you have mental health issues.

I won't fault the guy for being close to you because, well, he's kinda right, that's how grocery store lines work.

No one will support a smelly guy lol. 2) Say that you can't explain but you'll be gratefull if he steps back.\n\n3) Another option: leave if you haven't paid yet.

I think that your issues made you sense that the person was closer to you than people without such disorders would, which is something that you may want to consider in the future, given that no one else there thought the guy was out of line or too close to you.  But there's also no reason that the guy couldn't have taken a step back, even if he felt it was an odd request.\n\nNAH, just bad manners on his part.\n\nEdited to clarify.", "ESH\n\nYou should know being in public, there may be times where people are in your personal space.

If they argue, continue to leave your arm out to hold them back, and insist you are standing still and if they weren't so close, they wouldn't be bothered. Shopping baskets or trolleys are also a good tool to use here, as they can create space / a buffer between you and them.

Then you just keep a good distance between yourself and the person in front and you have a personal bubble.  \n(I also always use a trolley, never a basket.)\n\nIt\u2019s especially useful when paying and you get those people who stand so close when you\u2019re trying to enter your PIN, that you want to turn to them and ask \u201cwould you like to pay? Or climb into my pocket?\u201d", "NTA- I've seen people play this move standing too close until it's like you take half a step back and you're standing on them.  You should be able to move your arms around you without touching anyone.\n\nI don't know if there's a cashier nearby, but after you ask him to take a step away and he refused, you could then ask the cashier and tell him that you are not feeling safe and you've already asked them.  Likely he'll make a big deal about it, but you had already just asked them to move. \n\nYou are not being a Karen over this.  The guy was trying to intimidate you from the way he explained it.", "even without PTSD, I don't want anyone in my personal space, I'd ask nicely, then ... if he didn't back off, I'd TELL him to back off.  if he didn't... then I'd be less than nice", "People owe other people base-line courtesy, regardless of mental health issues.\n\nAsking someone to take a step back is far from burdensome or unreasonable.", "Not standing that close to someone is basic manners though. If I can turn and bump into them that's way too close. Personal space is a thing.", "No, it\u2019s not you at all, I\u2019m just super confused by that guy because he shouldn\u2019t have needed a reason. It\u2019s ridiculous. \u201cHey would you mind giving me a bit more space.\u201d \u201cSure no problem.\u201d Should\u2019ve been the end of it. So weird.", "You might want to see a therapist who specializes in PTSD. These situations will inevitably happen again, and breaking down crying immediately after they happen is not healthy for your mental state. The general public is full of AHs and I dont suggest just avoiding it. Living a more \"normal\" life will help with your mental state. But that would be something for you to discuss with your therapist.", "Yeah, I don't want to assume poorly of strangers, but after you asked and he rudely said no, that was when I was like \"ah, ok, he is actively is going out of his way to make you uncomfortable.\" It would have been far easier to say, \"Oh my bad, *steps back*\", but he took the \"be an asshole\" route on purpose. Give yourself a pat on the back :)", "I feel like i learnt it at school. We all had to put a hand on the shoulder of the one in front of us to know if we were well placed. most of the time I have issues with old people, if I slightly move next to the stroller there is no more room for me to be behind it to push it...", "And it's just really effective. \"Fight\" for your space OP:)", "I'd read something a couple of years ago that REALLY helped me, maybe you can glean from it as well in situations with other people!\nIt's just simply that most of what people do have nothing at all to do with YOU.\n\nWe need to remember that everyone has things they are dealing with, big and small, that can affect their mood and behavior. \n\nSo try to take a mental step back and remember this.", "Oh he's been heckling the snuggleers for years \ud83e\udd23 people like getting all up in his back pocket for some reason. I've had it happen to me too. I usually will look back, get firm eye contact and say 'could you please not crowd me here, I know we are all in a hurry'", "You wouldn't be alone, there's a whole subreddit dedicated to yeeting kids. \n\nMy cousin was fine. My uncle got in very serious therapy and he's also really good now. \n\nAs for me, the PTSD symptoms are way way less intense. Just took a long time to get here", "It's mental illness. It's not logical.", "From Walmart I do pick up and as long as you spend 35$ it\u2019s free pick up, same with raileys and target I believe, they charge an extra like 3-5$ but you get it back within the week after you\u2019ve picked up. They just charge that extra part incase something you picked is out of stock and they might pick a more expensive item (and if you don\u2019t want that more expensive item there\u2019s an option to remove their substitutions) but yeah I\u2019ve literally never had a woman come up in my bubble while at the grocery store, dispensary, etc etc but men are alwayssss in my space and wanna be breathing on my neck basically. The only real stores I even go to now are the dispensaries and it happens less often but every blue moon there\u2019s that one dude who\u2019s all up in my grill and I\u2019ll just let it be known I see you. Idk why but in my head I always think they\u2019ll try to touch me or grab me (probably the ptsd lmfao) so my guard is up and in my head if they come to touch me im punching you in the face \u2620\ufe0f", "Any grocery in a moderate to large city", "They weren't, this person is bonkers.", "And you do have a good point. It may very well be that it was me that felt like he was closer than he should have been, but like, if he had shifted, he would have bumped into me, so I don't think I was imagining it. I am typically pretty good about letting it go if people seem close, but this time I couldn't.", "You were hypersensitive.  HIS manners were bad.", "That and no assholes telling you to \"*SMILE*.\" That was glorious.", "In my country people stand so far apart that I can't always work out if they are in the queue and sometimes the queue of say 4 people won't fit in the shop. It's a change from my birth country where people will actually press up against you. I'd prefer something in between.", "Yeah, I think a lot of people liked that aspect of things haha", "True, but lines were also so long it was hard to find where they curved and ended.", "It was so great when Richard Ayoade was asked about social distancing. He said finally people are standing the appropriate distance from each other.", "Yeah, a handful of you guys have suggested this or something similar, so I will def be doing this from now on. It's definitely great advice", "Honestly, it sounds like he was doing it on purpose. He was pissy about losing his place in line and wanted to punish you for\u2026 existing? There is literally no reason to stand that close to a stranger in public, except maybe in a crowded subway car. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry you had to experience that. Next time, try to remember that you don\u2019t have to be polite about the physical space you take up in the world. \u201cMister, you are standing way too close to me. Take a step back.\u201d\n\nETA: NTA", "oh, I get what you're saying! I misunderstood. Yeah, I didn't get it either. I purposely didn't mention my stuff initially, and just asked for personal boundaries. But when he said no, I was like, \"but...But?\" I was kinda shocked by his response too haha.", "I see what you mean! I getcha. The response kinda struck you that way and I could see why, for sure. Funny thing was, the guy said that \"most people say I'm a nice guy\" and I was just like, \"oh, well...??\" thinking to myself haha. I had no idea what to say to that. I never said that he wasn't a nice person in general or anything haha! I just wanted some space hahahhaha", "hhahaha that is just too epic, though! haha.   \n\n\nAnd yeah, I sometimes forget that it's not necessarily about me. I think it's an automatic response for a lot of people, to take things personally and internalize people's reactions. In my case, it's probably because of my trauma haha. So, you have a really good point that I should try to take a mental moment to remind myself that it's not always me to blame. Thanks for the reminder! <3", "Yeah, it's definitely a process! I have come pretty far in my recovery journey, for sure! And everyone who knows me and how I used to be compared to now, says it. But, it's not a linear path haha. So, good for you for getting help and keeping on with you and good for your uncle for doing that too! <3", "Sure but that's not going to stop the cops from arresting you.", "Good to know! I'll probably be trying this from now on, or maybe taking a friend with me to shop, at least for a little while, while I work through the \"trauma\" of what happened haha. That way I have backup or whatever, to help me.   \n\n\nI don't think he was going to touch me or anything, like be inappropriate, but if things had gone that way, I can def say I would not have been nice in that situation. I wouldn't have been as polite haha", "No, I live in one of the larger cities in the US. This is not done.", "Hmm...maybe I got lucky in all the large cities I've lived in because even in Los Angeles we never got into grocery lines like sardines in a tin.", "Yet, he didn't bump into you, did he?  That is still just your perception of the situation, not something that actually occurred.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I barely made it out the door before breaking down. Tears, hyperventilating\n\nBoth your reaction and the 3rd party involved's reaction indicate that you're overly sensitive to the situation (Obviously, the person who you felt was too close felt that you were as well, but his opinion is discarded for bias).", "I wish. Worked as a cashier for a bit during covid. It was always some older male coustomer asking me if I would take my mask off because it looked like I.had a pretty smile.", "My go to for being told to smile  is \"walk away and give me a good reason to\"", "Another good one is to stand with your elbows sticking out behind you, and if they're that close take a half step back but not looking at them. Then turn all surprised and go \"oh I'm sorry, didn't realize anyone would be standing *that* close.\"", "Yeah, he's a \"NiCe GuY\" - if someone has to say how nice they are out loud, they're normally not nice lol.", "So, is it your belief that a person is only too close if they actually bump into you/touch you? That's your criteria that you feel I should have had?", "I also worked as a cashier and I had some old butt tell me that \u201che could tell from my eyes that I was clearly not smiling.\u201d \n\nThe dead eye look he got after wasn\u2019t satisfactory either. And I got my first complaint. Dick.", "hahahha so true! That's what they say! \"A lion doesn't need to tell you he's a lion\" haha", "Someone says how nice they are, I immediately start to distrust them. Why are you trying to convince me?", "No no no, do not take this to heart. I work in a grocery store. You would not believe the shit people will just let slide in a grocery line because \u201cit isn\u2019t their business\u201d it is perfectly reasonable for me to believe this guy was right on your back and no one said anything either to him for being too close, or to support you when you spoke up, because it \u201cisn\u2019t their business\u201d. People look away ALL THE TIME when they think something isn\u2019t their problem. I have watched people look up, look at a customer scream obscenities at a teenage girl working the register for minimum wage over a price that she has *zero* power to control, and then look down at their phones like nothing is wrong. Maybe, *maybe* one of them will record it. Almost never will anyone speak up. \n\nThat no one would speak up if someone was too close to you is the most believable part of this. If you told me that others in line even noticed I\u2019d be way more surprised. Do not take the commenter above to heart. We honestly have no idea if you were being too sensitive to the range of the person, but as a socially anxious person myself, I\u2019d say you aren\u2019t. Knowing my proximity to things is key to survival as a anxious person. I can\u2019t risk hitting or touching things and causing a scene myself, so I am constantly checking my bubble for danger spots I may encounter. I bet you do too. NTA", "No.  I believe that you are the only person who thought that the man was standing too close to you and that you have admitted that you have issues that strongly indicate that his being too close to you was only your perception, not the actual reality.", "Thank you for this. You not only describe the situation(s) I've seen in my own grocery store (or any store) with people in line or in general. Everyone is just kinda to themselves for the most part. Which is fine. But, I am agreeing that the guy behind the too-close guy was probably exactly this \\^\\^. And I'm glad you said that. And that you have the experience to validate that. I appreciate you bringing that awareness and experience to your reply. :)", "Perhaps. Perhaps not. Regardless, if the person was touching me or not, close or super close, whether it was just me or whether it wasn't just me, I don't feel like I'm an hole for asking for a little space. Shrug. I don't know.", "No prob, I\u2019m just speaking from what I know. 20 years working my way up the grocery ladder, and 25 of living with an anxiety disorder. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s like the other commenter hasn\u2019t seen the thousands of videos people take daily in grocery stores of weird shit happening, and most of the time maybe you\u2019ll get a customer service manager come over. Customers don\u2019t do anything. If it\u2019s something as small and subtle as someone standing too close, no employee is going to notice, and no bystander is going to step in. That\u2019s just how it is. Heads down, even if you don\u2019t have a phone. Shoes suddenly become *fascinating*.\n\nSo no worries, you\u2019re cool and I hope you have a good day and can stop sweating over this, \u2018cause another thing I know is how these thoughts get in there and stick until ya gotta ask strangers on Reddit about it. I\u2019ve been there too. You\u2019ve got this, you did all the right things, so go about your life knowing that dude was just being weird and difficult and made it your problem for no reason.", "Yes, there's nothing wrong with asking.  And that is why I judged NAH."]}
