Holding my few items, I made my way over to the express checkout lane. The guy in front of me (we had just about arrived the same time) got out of line and I moved up.   \n\n\nSeveral moment shortly after, he returned to line (having gotten the item he forgot or having failed to find a faster line), with a huff. At first, he was standing normally in line (that was now wrapping around a display table to avoid blocking foot traffic). Then he moved and he was right behind me. I mean, RIGHT behind me. Goodbye personal bubble haha.\n\nI have PTSD and an anxiety disorder and I was very uncomfortable with him being practically on top of me (presumably from his impatience with the long line). I had also just done a very stressful 2 hour drive that already had me feeling anxious. So, for the first time ever when someone's stood too close to me in line, I spoke up.   \n\n\nI turned to him and asked him if he could take a step back. He said \"no\". I added the explanation that I have PTSD (I do take medication and get help, BTW) and that I would like him to not be that close. This lead to a few quick snips at each other on both our parts about how I asked nicely, he wasn't a mind reader, etc. \n\nThe line started moving at that point, as the person that had been in front, grabbed their paid-for items and headed out. As I moving forward with the line, I could have sworn I heard the guy behind the too-close guy behind me say, \"Shouldn't be in a grocery line then\"...Like I shouldn't be in a line if I have those issues and don't like people being too close (which is rarely the case, by the way haha). \n\nI barely made it out the door before breaking down. Tears, hyperventilating...Full-on anxiety attack. It was hard enough for him to be that close and even harder to speak up for my boundaries. And I was very hurt by why the other guy said about me. I wasn't trying to be a jerk. I was just so taken by surprise at the whole thing. And I'm not really comfortable with confrontation. \n\nSo, anyway, AITA for advocating for myself and asking the guy to take a step back because he was literally right behind me?  Does the guy that said I should \"not be in a grocery line\" have a point? Or do you think it was okay to ask him to take a step back?   \n\n\nI'm open to hearing your thoughts, but I'm still really sensitive and feel like I got hit by an emotional truck after my anxiety attack yesterday. So, whatever your verdict, I just ask that you say it with sensitivity haha. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1689848669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154n3r3/aita_for_asking_a_guy_to_take_a_step_back/", "score": 565, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially since the pandemic, I do this all the time, and people are usually completely reasonable about it. \n\nHonestly, especially if you\u2019re a guy making a woman uncomfortable, be polite, we\u2019re usually a lot smaller than you and we may feel intimidated and uncomfortable. If someone asks you to step out of their personal space and your response is to get upset, I\u2019m now even more uncomfortable because you have zero respect for boundaries. What a strange response. If someone asked me to back up a bit my response would be \u201cof course, no problem.\u201d How hard is that?", "NTA\n\nThat person violated your personal space and made you feel uncomfortable.

Unless the store was packed and there literally was no room, you are fair to ask.", "I am very sorry that happened to you. I hope you can start to feel more comfortable out in public.

Some people have no concept of personal space. Your guy left the line without asking you to hold his spot. Considering he got right back in line directly behind you he was just pissy. It really had nothing to do with you at all.", "Nta but people don't owe you anything because you have mental health issues. They are your problems and your problems alone.\n\nThat being said personal space is implied outside and people should respect it.", "I also have PTSD.

It's almost inevitable.", "NTA. Assuming he wasn\u2019t from a culture with different norms, everyone knows when they\u2019ve invaded your personal-space bubble.

Then he got annoyed when you didn\u2019t offer and stepped closer to prove some point. So he was already in confrontation mode when you turned around and spoke to him. You\u2019re still NTA.

I don\u2019t even go into stores anymore, if pick up is an option I\u2019d rather do that bc this is always happening.

The most effective way is to say the request and the because at the same time. That way you avoid a negotiation.\n\nHe knew exactly what he was doing. He was actively trying to hurt you.

I won't fault the guy for being close to you because, well, he's kinda right, that's how grocery store lines work.

You can't count on every other person giving a shit about your PTSD", "Put a cart behind you so it's between you and the next person. I started doing it after some drunk people getting to close to me. \n\nAnyway you don't owe an explanation. 1) Say he smells badly coz you have sensory issues after covid or something. No one will support a smelly guy lol. 2) Say that you can't explain but you'll be gratefull if he steps back.\n\n3) Another option: leave if you haven't paid yet.

I swing it if I need to!", ">As I moving forward with the line, I could have sworn I heard the guy behind the too-close guy behind me say, \"Shouldn't be in a grocery line then\".\n\nMy judgement is based on this input from a neutral 3rd party who was an actual witness to the spacing between you and the person behind you.  I think that your issues made you sense that the person was closer to you than people without such disorders would, which is something that you may want to consider in the future, given that no one else there thought the guy was out of line or too close to you.  But there's also no reason that the guy couldn't have taken a step back, even if he felt it was an odd request.\n\nNAH, just bad manners on his part.\n\nEdited to clarify.", "ESH\n\nYou should know being in public, there may be times where people are in your personal space.
