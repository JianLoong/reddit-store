My husband has been dealing with some internal problem of hating my sister and her fianc\u00e9. Because \u201che tries to be funny and he\u2019s not\u201d. And it has honestly blown up our entire family. My husband thinks since he doesn\u2019t like my sister fianc\u00e9, then we all shouldn\u2019t. We just had a baby in May and so I am just feeling really overwhelmed w this petty situation. Last weekend my husband helped my parents with their yard. My parents have helped us a lot the past years and this was kinda paying off some debt, but also just being kind. Well my sister wanted to go to dinner with all of us and my husband freaked out changed plans and blamed my parents for not telling her no \u201cbecause he doesn\u2019t like her\u201d and he was looking forward to going to dinner. It has completely blown up into him calling my parents names, blocking them, and threatening them to not ever see our baby again. I feel bad after a 10 year relationship I can not see past the fact of him disrespecting my family. Am I the asshole for not understanding his side of things and thinking that there\u2019s no coming back from this? My life feels like it is falling apart and I just want to make the right choice for my child.\n\nEdit: my sister and her fianc\u00e9 have done nothing to my husband. Other than being annoying. He is the only person in this family who doesn\u2019t like them. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s some internal problem. See he\u2019s been the only boy in our family for almost 10 years before she met someone so idk if that has something to do with it or not. It\u2019s exhausting. He admits he\u2019s being childish and doesn\u2019t change. But for the most part blames my parents for \u201cdisrespecting him\u201d and not telling her no to going to dinner.\n\nEdit #2: I feel like my husband is losing his mind. He\u2019s now saying that my parents are not allowed to see our baby. He doesn\u2019t want to go to counseling to fix this, and very impossible to talk to. I have tried understanding, being patient, supportive, and even tried tough love towards him during his differences and none of it has helped. Tbh I am a bit worried for my baby\u2019s sake I do not want to uproot her life, change her routine, and what not. I am stuck in the middle and i am horrified. He will obviously throw a temper tantrum no matter what. \nThank you all for the validation, and some people gave advice and I appreciate it! I can hope that he comes around to counseling but if not I\u2019m afraid my life is about to change significantly.", "created_utc": 1667136752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhee3m/aita_for_choosing_my_family_over_my_husband/", "score": 387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There are always going to be conflicts in families - some big, some small.  It sounds like your husband wants to make the rules for everyone.  You all can agree to disagree.  His demands are unreasonable and unsustainable in a family unless you go no-contact.  That's not fair to you or your child since you don't have a problem.

Of course they won't exclude her.\n\nYour husband may need counseling, but at the very least he needs to be told that he isn't the leader of a middle school clique, and he doesn't get to decide who participates in the family.

To put it kindly, something is very wrong with your husband; he appears to feel threatened by your BIL's presence, and is throwing a tantrum to force the attention back onto himself. \n\nYou are quite right not to countenance such behaviour, regardless of who it is. Imagine life going forward with this man, this situation. You need to take steps. I would suggest that a separation contingent on him getting therapy would be a good start.", "NTA.

Your husband is entitled to his opinion, but he is not entitled to force it on others, including his wife (and especially it his in-laws). He needs to grow up and understand that the world does not revolve around him and his opinions and stop throwing temper tantrums when he doesn\u2019t get his way. He also needs to understand that he doesn\u2019t rule your household like a dictator - you get a say in things as well, so he doesn\u2019t get to unilaterally get to say who gets to see your baby or doesn\u2019t.

Or has he always been like this?\n\nThis expectation for everyone to dislike who he dislikes is crazy (and I mean perhaps needs a professional therapist type of crazy). Threatening to stop your parents from seeing their grandchild is absolutely and utterly unreasonable.\n\nIf you're questioning if you're being reasonable by not siding with him during obviously wrong behaviour on his part, I'm wondering how long he's been amping up the crazy to get to this point? I always hate to suggest this but if he's like this it might be best for your child to rethink your marriage altogether.\n\nEdited to add: it can happen that new fathers can go through a depression similar to post natal depression.

This would likely be caused by a high stress level and a sudden severe stressor. 3) Defending against a threat that he can't consciously name.
