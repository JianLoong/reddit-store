Or cases of children, who hurt themselves because of peer bullying, and adults being aware of the situation, but don\u2019t act in defense of the children. \n\nLast night I was sent an iMessage with an audio file of what sounded like a child being abused. It was brutally graphic. At first I thought it was spam because it came from an iCloud account, so I replied back \u201csick f@@k\u201d. At that point, I started to get calls from a local number. I eventually answered to a teenage boy telling me it\u2019s a prank meant for someone with a similar number to mine. \n\nYou guys can use your imagination but I sincerely think hearing it makes a difference in judging my reaction \n\nI did the 2023 thing, and googled the number and iCloud email (which has the kids full name) and I found a Facebook account that I was pretty sure belonged to his dad. I messaged the dad explaining that I wanted to talk to him about audio sent to me by who I thought was his son. I truly believe that the audio was meant to trick and harass someone in the form of a cruel prank. I was trying to handle this on the parent-to-parent level - or at least get a sense of whether or not this parent would care that their child was up to something like this. \n\nDad called me, and before going into details I asked the father if I could confirm the contact info to make sure it was his son and not an unrelated minor. Suddenly, a woman was on the line shouting and cursing at me. She was telling me that it was her son, and she didn\u2019t know what I was making a big deal about. It was hard to understand what she was saying because she was talking fast. I ended up hanging up. Upon the urging of my family, I went to my local police station and informed them of what happened. I wasn\u2019t sure of what to do but it felt really wrong to keep this to myself. \n\nI only wanted some sort of record that this happened, just in the off-chance it was part of something more serious. The detective explained to me that the report only establishes what happened. If someone with that contact info is involved in any criminal activity, the report would come up as possibly related. It would be up to any officer investigating a future crime to read the report and determine if the person in the report is the same person as they are currently dealing with.  This is all I wanted. I don\u2019t want to take it any further. \n\nThe dad later messaged me and said that the kid (17 btw) made a TikTok video last night at 2 am with the disturbing audio. He said he was going to discuss with his son the nature of the audio, but that it was weird for an adult to be on TikTok at 2 AM. I replied the audio file was sent at 7 PM last night to my cell and then I blocked him.

Rape jokes aren\u2019t funny. Sexual assault isn\u2019t funny. And they need to be told this. Swiftly, and emphatically. If their parents aren\u2019t going to do it, the fucking police can. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry but if you\u2019re a parent who automatically believes the first story out of your kid\u2019s mouth when they get caught doing something like this, you need a reality check. First, it\u2019s not as if it\u2019s funny and harmless if he posted it to TikTok. Second, as parents you should be monitoring his TikTok.\n\nBetter you\u2019re alerted to it now and it comes down than you\u2019re none the wiser and it gets him fired in his twenties, or becomes the subject of a police investigation.", "Every kid has an \u201coh fuck\u201d moment. A moment where you do something so egregious or insane or illegal or dangerous because you\u2019re genuinely so stupid and ignorant and naive that you didn\u2019t even conceive of the gravity or the consequences.  Like, you set something on fire in school cuz you\u2019re just playing with a lighter and then you get suspended and your parents get called in and it\u2019s a whole thing because *FIRE,* duh. Or you\u2019re fucking around on your phone and you get into a car accident that you\u2019re lucky wasn\u2019t fatal, because you don\u2019t think it\u2019ll happen to *you.* Or you threaten someone horrifically, because everyone else is also bullying them, you\u2019re desensitized, you think it\u2019s a joke, and you didn\u2019t realize how fucking far over the line everyone already was before you took part and suddenly the police are involved.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t actually get appropriate consequences in that moment\u2026 it can really set you up for serious consequences as an adult. If you get away with it or your parents explain it away or it gets shrugged off and you\u2019re allowed to believe you shouldn\u2019t have known better, you don\u2019t learn.\n\nThis kid\u2019s parents are doing him a massive disservice. This is genuinely *life-ruining* stuff he is doing. A dumb \u201cprank\u201d like this could cost him a job later, or if it was genuinely on TikTok, could come back to haunt him at any point in his adulthood. All someone has to do is save it.
