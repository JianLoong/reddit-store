It was brutally graphic. At first I thought it was spam because it came from an iCloud account, so I replied back \u201csick f@@k\u201d. At that point, I started to get calls from a local number.

I messaged the dad explaining that I wanted to talk to him about audio sent to me by who I thought was his son. I truly believe that the audio was meant to trick and harass someone in the form of a cruel prank. I was trying to handle this on the parent-to-parent level - or at least get a sense of whether or not this parent would care that their child was up to something like this. \n\nDad called me, and before going into details I asked the father if I could confirm the contact info to make sure it was his son and not an unrelated minor. Suddenly, a woman was on the line shouting and cursing at me. She was telling me that it was her son, and she didn\u2019t know what I was making a big deal about. It was hard to understand what she was saying because she was talking fast. I ended up hanging up. Upon the urging of my family, I went to my local police station and informed them of what happened. I wasn\u2019t sure of what to do but it felt really wrong to keep this to myself. \n\nI only wanted some sort of record that this happened, just in the off-chance it was part of something more serious. The detective explained to me that the report only establishes what happened. If someone with that contact info is involved in any criminal activity, the report would come up as possibly related. It would be up to any officer investigating a future crime to read the report and determine if the person in the report is the same person as they are currently dealing with.  This is all I wanted. I don\u2019t want to take it any further. \n\nThe dad later messaged me and said that the kid (17 btw) made a TikTok video last night at 2 am with the disturbing audio. He said he was going to discuss with his son the nature of the audio, but that it was weird for an adult to be on TikTok at 2 AM. I replied the audio file was sent at 7 PM last night to my cell and then I blocked him.
