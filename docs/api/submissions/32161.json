This is a throwaway account.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife and are in the process of doing a full remodel in my house. When I bought my house it was a 4 bedroom 1 bath.  Currently my wife and I share the master on the main floor and my stepdaughter (8) has the second main floor bedroom so she can be close to us. Before I got married, my daughter (16) was in that room and my sons (19 and 17 now) shared one of the upstairs bedrooms and I used the 4th room for storage. A couple of years ago before meeting my wife I had a 2 car detached garage built onto my property because it didn't have one when I bought the house.\r  \n\r  \nWhen my wife moved in with her kids, I put her four boys in the unfinished basement and put her daughter in the 2nd main floor room. I moved my daughter into the storage room upstairs.\r  \n\r\n\nSo basically we are now remodeling the kitchen on the main floor and adding 3 feet to each upstairs bedroom to make them larger. And we are finishing the basement, where we are adding 2 additional bedrooms. So right now there is no place for my son and daughter to sleep because their bedrooms are under construction, so what I did is told them they could sleep in the garage until the house is done. My daughter said that is ridiculous and asked me what is she supposed to do if she has to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, is she supposed to walk all the way across the back yard, unlock the back door, go upstairs to use the bathroom? I told her that seems like the most logical thing to me. She then asked what about when she is on her period, that's a little inconvenient, I told her that life is full of inconveniences. My son got mad and said why couldn't they just stay with their mother while we finish the remodel as it is very hard to live in a torn up house with 9 people and no privacy since they don't have rooms. I told them I had moved their beds and all their things to the garage and that is where they are going to sleep until the remodel is done. \r  \n\r\n\nWell my son apparently told my ex-wife this and she told all three of my kids about the time I decided to remodel our one bathroom in our old house, and how I started the remodel when she was 5 months pregnant with our first because I was doing it myself. She told them that we showered outside with a garden hose every night because we didn't have a shower for months. I mean, she's not lying, this happened, but I don't understand why she had to tell them? All it did was make them mad at me. To her credit she hasn't said anything to me about the current arrangement which usually she would have. But I don't know why she felt the need to tell them this, because then they just said I have a habit of inconveniencing people with my remodel projects. I am just trying to make the house nice for all of us to live in so I don't think it should really matter if they are inconvenienced by having to sleep in the garage for a few months.", "created_utc": 1701461428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188l5na/aita_for_making_my_kids_sleep_in_the_detached/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus, if the 16 and 17 year old asked the courts to let them live with their mother, there's a good chance it could happen because at that age, a judge will take the child's wishes into real consideration. Even if this doesn't happen (for example, if your ex-wife is unable to take them in), you are making them feel like you don't care about their wellbeing, during a time when they only have a few years left with you. Do you really want them to move out and go no-contact with you as soon as they are able to? This is NOT an acceptable solution and you need to think of something else. Make the living room into a bedroom (with a temporary partition if a boy and girl are sharing). Move your stepdaughter in with you and your wife, to free up a bedroom. Oh, you don't like that idea? Basically right now you are showing the family that you don't care about anyone's comfort except you, your wife and your stepdaughter. If the teens can suffer, so can the parents and the younger kids. What inconvenciences are YOU undergoing for the sake of your precious renovation project?? \n\nAnd making your ex-wife go for five months without a shower, during pregnancy and postpartum, is absolutely not acceptable.

Your kids need a place to eat, sleep and use a bathroom.

If this remodel was going to be the span of say two weeks  and everyone had elsewhere accommodations.  Your kids at moms and your wife and stepdaughter in a hotel.  You would be ok.  However if you plan on doing this yourself and when you have time it might take years. By the time you are done the kids will be 18 and want nothing to do with you.   You already kicked your daughter out of her room for your stepdaughter once.  Now you are kicking her out of the house entirely.  A Detached Garage is not a separate apartment.  It is your garage where your cars are.  They have no place to go to the restroom.  The garage I doubt gets air conditioning in hot weather and heat in cold weather.", "YTA.

This is a throwaway account.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife and are in the process of doing a full remodel in my house. When I bought my house it was a 4 bedroom 1 bath.  Currently my wife and I share the master on the main floor and my stepdaughter (8) has the second main floor bedroom so she can be close to us. Before I got married, my daughter (16) was in that room and my sons (19 and 17 now) shared one of the upstairs bedrooms and I used the 4th room for storage. A couple of years ago before meeting my wife I had a 2 car detached garage built onto my property because it didn't have one when I bought the house.\r  \n\r  \nWhen my wife moved in with her kids, I put her four boys in the unfinished basement and put her daughter in the 2nd main floor room. I moved my daughter into the storage room upstairs.\r  \n\r\n\nSo basically we are now remodeling the kitchen on the main floor and adding 3 feet to each upstairs bedroom to make them larger. And we are finishing the basement, where we are adding 2 additional bedrooms. So right now there is no place for my son and daughter to sleep because their bedrooms are under construction, so what I did is told them they could sleep in the garage until the house is done. My daughter said that is ridiculous and asked me what is she supposed to do if she has to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, is she supposed to walk all the way across the back yard, unlock the back door, go upstairs to use the bathroom? I told her that seems like the most logical thing to me. She then asked what about when she is on her period, that's a little inconvenient, I told her that life is full of inconveniences. My son got mad and said why couldn't they just stay with their mother while we finish the remodel as it is very hard to live in a torn up house with 9 people and no privacy since they don't have rooms. I told them I had moved their beds and all their things to the garage and that is where they are going to sleep until the remodel is done. \r  \n\r\n\nWell my son apparently told my ex-wife this and she told all three of my kids about the time I decided to remodel our one bathroom in our old house, and how I started the remodel when she was 5 months pregnant with our first because I was doing it myself. She told them that we showered outside with a garden hose every night because we didn't have a shower for months. I mean, she's not lying, this happened, but I don't understand why she had to tell them? All it did was make them mad at me. To her credit she hasn't said anything to me about the current arrangement which usually she would have. But I don't know why she felt the need to tell them this, because then they just said I have a habit of inconveniencing people with my remodel projects. I am just trying to make the house nice for all of us to live in so I don't think it should really matter if they are inconvenienced by having to sleep in the garage for a few months.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They\u2019re old enough to have a say in their accommodations \u2014 do you want to have a relationship with them later? Then I would be more flexible and understanding now. Esp since it may seem unfair that their step siblings dont have to sleep \u201coutside\u201d", "So your kids should fucking have to? I hope your ex takes you back to court for full custody, your kids are likely old enough to decide where they want to be.", "Your wife\u2019s wants are not more important than your children\u2019s needs. You are a parent. Your kids come first. They are not pets, you can\u2019t force them to stay in the garage when having them in the house is inconvenient for you.", "So basically you care how your wife feels but it's wrong that your children have those same feelings even though your wife is a grown ass adult and they are children.", "Life is just full of inconveniences... isn't that what you said? Or does it not apply to you?", "NEITHER DO YOUR KIDS ***DIPSHIT***", "Your wife is a huge AH and you're her enabler....", "Ah, so only the person who let's you get your dick wet matters.\n\nFuck your responsibilities as a parent, eh?", "Yeah and your kid doesn't either! Great parents my dude. /s", "With no tv and no phones which is how it should be.", "Are you serious? You know what, never mind. Enjoy your last few months. No contact is coming soon.", "Listen to yourself and imagine how a child welfare worker or judge would hear this:\n\nDad's house: sleep in a garage with no facilities, inadequate insulation, and with an opposite gendered teen sibling, for 2 years (you're previous comment regarding your 16 year old might turn 18 before it's done).\n\nMom's house: they have a TV and phone at night.\n\nDude, they're going to be staying with your ex. Your choice is wether it is going to be easy with you going a long with it, or difficult/costly with the court making you and CPS getting involved regarding ALL the kids.", "Yeah good luck with that fucking custody battle buddy. I hope their mom takes you to court \ud83d\udc9c", "No Sir. If you don\u2019t want those kids to cut contact with you, you\u2019ll have to stop being such a dick. Let them stay with their mother while you tear up your house. Forcing them to stay in the garage is horrible.", "Ok boomer..", "When you're lying in the hospital in a few decades and your children have no interest in coming to see you, remember this.  You'll know why you're alone.", "Note his eldest son stays with his mom when he comes home from college", "I agree. If I were mom in this situation I'd take him to court over this."]}
