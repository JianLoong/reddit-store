It was a 7 day trip. Today is my flight back home and my bf said he ll come to the airport to pick us up. I told him not to come because I'd reach the airport around 1am but he said he'd like to make it a tradition to always come to the airport to pick up the other person and I agreed. So on the way to airport I asked him if he could pick up some dinner forme beforehand because the restaurants would be closed when I land. I. Had to have this conversation on speaker because my phone was connected to the car. He said he ll pick up \"XYZ\" from restaurant \"ABC\" because it's my favorite and would like my favorite food after long flight and hectic trip. I said thanks and hung up after a while. \n\nAfter the call my friends said it was rude of him to assume what you wanna eat and not ask your input. I said the food he was going to get was exactly what I wanted to eat anyway and my friends said he would take this as a sign and do things without consulting me in future and I'm enabling him. So AITA here?\n\nEdit - another funny part to add is, he is dropping them off home as well because they didng leave their car at airport and cab would be expensive.

Your boyfriend knows you well enough to know your favorite food and that is supposed to be a red flag?  I hope he has more red flags exactly like this one, including the terrible habit of wanting to pick you up at 1 in the morning from the airport.  Lose your friends, not your boyfriend.", "NTA. Your friends don't know what the hell they're talking about. Your bf sounds considerate and thoughtful.", "NTA, dump the friends.", "NTA. Your BF sounds wonderful and your friends are the AH's here.\n\nYour boyfriend knows your tastes and if you wanted something else you could have said so and I have no doubt that he would have gotten it for you. \n\nHe would only have been an asshole if he said,  \"I am picking you up a lovely vegan dish\" and you said, \"But I want a big, juicy cheeseburger\".  \"No, that wouldn't be healthy.

Your friends are way overstepping.

My wife and I know one another\u2019s favorite meals at certain places and there are times we pick up dinner and get what we already know the other will like without having to ask them.
