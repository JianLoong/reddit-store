I told him not to come because I'd reach the airport around 1am but he said he'd like to make it a tradition to always come to the airport to pick up the other person and I agreed. So on the way to airport I asked him if he could pick up some dinner forme beforehand because the restaurants would be closed when I land. I. Had to have this conversation on speaker because my phone was connected to the car.

I said thanks and hung up after a while. \n\nAfter the call my friends said it was rude of him to assume what you wanna eat and not ask your input.
