You literally ate all the food I ordered for myself and your sibling? I asked you a bunch of times what you guys wanted, why would you do that? You both are selfish. Now they are upset with me and think I overreacted. I think that was extremely selfish of them. They didn't even care if their sibling or I got to eat.

Likely followed by the thought of \"oh well\" or similar. You did not overreact but id be a bit upset at them having the audacity to be mad at me for their selfishness.", "NTA.\n\n11 and 9 is very young, but this is a very simple exercise in empathy. Not sure how anyone can justify them eating all of the food, particularly food they didn\u2019t ask for and that they know is reserved for others, and then also not caring that they upset people because of their poor choices.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t have to escalate into a huge deal, but I think it would be good to have a conversation with them after things have calmed down to discuss the importance of considering others. They\u2019re still young so it\u2019s normal to expect impulsive and/or selfish actions, but that doesn\u2019t mean you just drop the matter and let it slide.", "NTA. Why didn't your hisband stop them? Does this happen often?", "NTA they were incredibly selfish you should have your husband also explain this to them.", "NTA They don't get to say they're not hungry then eat the share of food meant for you and your 3 year old.. That's messed up.   \n\n\nYou're right that was extremely selfish of them to do that.   \n\n\nIf my brother and I make some food we try to make sure there's always extra for our parents if either one might be interested in having some.   \n\n\nYour other two kids should have tried to make sure there was some food left at least.", "NTA. That's frustrating and rude. So why did they do that, what'd they say when you asked? Has this ever happened before?

Kids will always be upset when called selfish or facing consequences it\u2019s part of the kid brain. Maybe explain to them why what they did was wrong and how it was selfish instead of just calling them selfish and leaving it at that. Sometimes kids just need to be explained why and how what they did was wrong and self centered", "NTA, next time you get food out you should eat their portion, maybe teach them a bit of empathy. I would probably also make them cook meals/snacks for the 3 year old to make up for it.", "ESH \n\nThey're old enough to know better in terms of hogging all the food.\n\nBut, it's ridiculous as the parent in the situation here to have not ordered something for your eldest to make sure they had a meal if they were hungry. They're an 11 year old pre-teen. Just because they aren't hungry when the order goes in, doesn't mean they won't be hungry later. And in general, you should be encouraging them to eat a decent meal after a busy day.", "ESH\n\nThe kids were selfish but they are kids and learning how life works, you as the parent made two mistakes, 1. You didn\u2019t order enough food for everyone, they were going to get hungry at some point and if you didn\u2019t have much in then what did you expect them to eat. 2. Why did you get in the shower when you knew food was being delivered, if you\u2019d waited until after then this wouldn\u2019t have happened. \n\nAs the parent it is your job to make sure everyone eats, not an 11 and 9 year old, if they were teens that would be a bit different but still your ultimate responsibility.", "YTA\n\nThey are children, and probably didn't realize what they were doing and how it would affect you. (it's really easy though adult glasses to  be frustrated by this, but they are kids who saw food and ate it. It's not malicious or selfish, it's kids being kids).\n\nIf you had to ask them all 10 times \"are you sure that's all you want\", then you knew it wasn't going to be enough for them. \n\nAt that point as the parent, and adult in the situation, you should have either ordered extra food, knowing they would be hungry and you didn't have any other food available, or said \"ok, but that's all you're eating\" and made sure you were there when the food was delivered to dish it all out.", "NAH, it\u2019s definitely fair to be frustrated because you double-checked that it was all the food your elder two kids wants. But, being at that age, it\u2019s hard to have insight into that even though you\u2019re not hungry at the moment, you\u2019ll be hungry by the time said food arrives.", "For starters if I knew dinner was being delivered, I wouldn't have had a shower while waiting for it to be delivered.  \n\nSecondly, regardless if the two older ones said I would have ordered extra for them if I suspected that what they ordered wouldn't be enough.\n\nBut also, they are 11 and 9 - no-one else is on their radar in regards to food.  And did you tell them that the salad is for you?", "Why are you posting about ur literal children instead of talking to them?", "YTA.   Were they selfish, absolutely....are they kids? Yes.   Kids ALWAYS say they aren't hungry and then it turns out they are.   You should have planned ahead and ordered for them anyways, knowing there wasn't really good in the house.

Its not a harsh punishment, but very effective.\n\nMy parents did it all the time and it worked pretty well. When we were annoyed about our chore and acted careless with e.g. the dishes and broke smthg - they took it from your pocket money (not if we were careful and had an accident, though). If we broke smthg from a sibling we could either make a deal with the sibling (trading smthg or doing their chores for a certain time) but if the sibling wanted the item replaced it came from our pocket money. We got pocket money every week and it was a set amount by age range. Oc when we were small and only got like 2$ per week they didn't make us pay the full amount of an item, but still enough that it hurt. \n\nThis way we learnt that if you do financial harm to others, you reimburse them, period. We also learnt if you want to spend your money on yourself, you better act careful with other ppls stuff. I do this till today.", "Thank you for the insight. They were upset and crying in their room and I told them I wasn't mad, just disappointed in them for not thinking of others in the family.", "11 and 9 are both old enough to make themselves sandwiches or have cereal. 11 is 6th grade!

I was showering with my 3 yr old and the door was wide open so they definitely could have asked.", "I can't think of a time this has specifically happened. I am on a diet right now and pretty strict with what I eat so sometimes when we are grocery shopping I will pick something specifically for me and ask them if they want me to get another of that item or something else they like. They sometimes say no they don't want what I'm getting but then eat it anyways. That bothers me sometimes because they definitely always have food in the house.", "We had been in the sprinklers and were all soaked. They took a shower the same time my youngest and I did and got out a bit before us.", "We had food. I meant I didn't have anything prepared to make dinner. Our fridge and pantries are stocked.", "Yes, I definitely realize I should have ordered more food. Thank you for the insight.", "My husband thinks I slightly overreacted and said they were probably just hungry and we could always order more.. Which I understand and  I would always give them anything they needed before myself especially food wise. I was upset because although I didn't tell them I had ordered a salad they are smart enough and old enough to know it didn't just magically appear, especially since neither of them ordered it. I honestly would not have given a single thought if they had said they wanted the salad when it came. It bothers me they didn't wait for us to get out of the shower to even ask.", "We had been outside playing in the sprinklers so everyone was soaking wet and wanted to take a shower before.", "No, I didn't tell them I had ordered a salad.", "I did talk to them.", "Completely agree! It would definitely be worth it to have a discussion with your kids about empathy here. \n\nThere are people on the thread who are telling you to just order food for your kids regardless of what they say.  \n\nMy brother is just like your kids- he said \u201cno\u201d to food all the time and constantly ate off my moms plate as a kid. It was cute then but now at 18 years old, he\u2019s just come to expect that he will eat others\u2019 food. Can\u2019t tell you the amount of times we have ordered pizza and he says he\u2019s not hungry just to eat an entire pizza and leave the rest of us to share one. Your kids have to learn to ask for what they want!\n\nThis is why I think NTA.", "You put a stop to this by firmly not letting them eat your food. They declined? Sorry, actions have consequences. They are old enough to fix themselves a sandwich. If you don\u2019t stop them from eating others food now, they will be the jerk housemates or partners that gobble up things that don\u2019t belong to them instead of being considerate", "You should have told the older two not to touch the salad.", "So you went to get a shower, told them the food would be delivered, didn\u2019t tell them you ordered something. They get the food when it\u2019s delivered and eat it. \n\nThey\u2019re kids. They didn\u2019t know. And they were hungry.", "And there's the problem.  You can't be angry at them for eating a meal they didn't know was yours.  Typically a  salad is a side dish not a meal.", "Oh ffs, no it\u2019s not.  Many salads are a complete meal with protein, carbs and veggies all together.  There\u2019s no way these kids looked at that salad and thought it was theirs.  They just decided to be greedy and eat everything instead of waiting and asking.", "Hence why I said that OP should have told them that the salad was hers and ordered extra for them.  OP even asked the kids if they wanted more, it appeared that she suspected that what they ordered wouldn't have been enough. I know my kids, I know that I need to spell some things out to them (like \"the salad is mine, DO NOT EAT IT!\").  I know when they order if they will want more or not.", "NTA, but it's definitely worth having a discussion about it with your kids. When I was 11 (and my younger sibling was 9), I caught him trying to steal my share. I got super pissed about it at the time, but my brother was immediately apologetic.\n\nThe reaction coming coming from your kids is really odd imo. By 9-11, while they can act selfishly and impulsively, they *should* have a sense of what's right and wrong. I have little cousins of these ages, and I don't think I've ever seen them *that* completely unapologetic of their bad actions. \n\nI think you can start by sitting them down and letting them know how it would feel like for you and their sibling. Sure they were hungry, but then can't they empathise with their mom (who's been taking care of them all day, and don't even have time to cook) and little sibling not having anything to eat? Doesn't that sound selfish? What would they feel if their mom or other sibling ate all their food when they're starving?\n\n(But as an Asian, my mom would definitely not give me dinner as a lesson or something lmao. *That* way I'd definitely learn, but that's considered too cruel nowadays \ud83d\ude02)", "What did you order for the 11 & year olds? Because we all know just because they say they don't want anything now, that will change in 1/2 an hour. Yes, it was selfish of them but also kind of expected.", "so which one was. it you were gone all day shopping if you knew you didn't have food in the house why didn't you also shop for food. or were yall playing in the sprinklers? how'd yall go from.getting home after along day of shopping to oh we were playing in the sprinklers at the same time.", "And as a parent it\u2019s one thing for them to eat MY food. That\u2019s so annoying and bad-mannered as it is. But to eat the food of their 3-year-old sibling who is now hungry and I have to find something else for them to eat\u2026 may even affect bed time timings if I don\u2019t have anything to hand. That would just make me livid. Kids got off light!", "You need to address this with them. Explain to them that when it is expected that certain foods are off limits, such as when some one buys a specific treat for themselves or when take out is ordered, and that they need to not touch without asking. Then you need to punish them when they do it. Kids can sometimes be thoughtless but they won't get better if you don't teach them", "They ate everything. Leaving nothing for younger sibling or mum. Knowing what's hers wouldn't matter. They should realise that two people can't eat if they eat all of what there is. That's the issue.", "Yes, because kids that age really don't think beyond themselves.  My kids would have done the same thing.  I would have told them before hand what was mine", "It doesn't sound like mum was exactly furious and raging at the event. Just let them know they should have been more considerate and less selfish. And when they absorb that after dealing with being kids and not wanting to take any fault initially, hopefully they'll have this thought every time there is takeout rather than needing everything listed each time. \n\nConsideration of others can absolutely be taught at the age they are. A day of being moody is fine and the kids will recover from not being handheld. Not eating more than you fair share, waiting a couple of mins or everyone to eat together etc are better lessons to work on than having to specify on who gets what each time.", "NTA. \n\nWhenever I get takeout with my son, he always *asks* if he\u2019d like to have something that he didn\u2019t ask to order for himself. He\u2019s *5*. If he can do it, kids twice his age can too. Hold them accountable.", "NTA for getting upset. Personally, I'd be less upset about them eating my food, it's them eating their siblings portion that would have upset me.\n\nBut... I also would have ordered food for them anyway, even if they said they're not hungry. Even if they didn't eat it when it comes, it can go in the fridge for later.\n\nThis is a learning experience for both you and your children.", "NTA\n\nIf they're that upset. Tell them to go on a hunger strike. Won't even last 2 meals.", "NTA. I would punish them they are old enough to know better", "YTA. When my kids think they are \"not hungry and don't want dinner\", I always make sure there is enough dinner for them anyway to eat when they inevitably do get hungry later. Worst case, you have leftovers for lunch the next day and that is pretty rare. Also, after 9 and 11 years together, you should have an idea of what your kids like and how much they eat. So when your kids said they were not hungry and refused to pick a meal, as the responsible adult, you should have ordered them a sufficiant meal each anyway. That is being a parent.", "Yes, these two definitely need punished and told it was wrong to eat food meant for someone else. But really, they are only 9 and 11 so of course they will be hungry later on. Just order them something. Completely different if these were kids in their mid teens but younger children don\u2019t think about being hungry later on refuse a meal order.", "I can\u2019t work out how to quote but you literally said in your post \u201cwe\u2019d been gone the majority of the day and by the time we got home it was too late to cook and we didn\u2019t have much except snack stuff\u201d so after you\u2019d been out at the shops getting Father\u2019s Day gifts you prioritised playing in sprinklers and having a shower over sorting out dinner for your kids ( I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t come home from the shops soaking so you must\u2019ve got wet at home), then ordered take out via your husband and didn\u2019t get food for all your kids, I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s on you as the adult. If you didn\u2019t want to cook why would your 11 & 9 year olds, they are children, it is your responsibility to make sure they eat. I might even have changed to YTA", ">Consideration of others can absolutely be taught at the age they are.\n\nAnd communication is the key to learning.  Of which OP didn't communicate with the kids beforehand.", "I think eating bits of the wrong dish would have been ops fault entirely, even if understandable witj busy day and having to shower little one before. Eating everything and leaving nothing for little sibling or mum is something that shouldn't need communicating every time at 10 and would still require a conversation on that mistake even if mum wasnt specific. You start needing basic understanding of considering others and thinking a bit more at quite a young age \n\nMum can adjust and be more specific for a bit. But she didn't do anything wrong and wasn't crazy for thinking that kids that age shouldn't assume they get to eat literally everything and leave nothing for mum and little one. They were really hungry and temporarily selfish, it's not the end of the world to be called out and reflect on that. Didnt sound like they face the wrath of an evil mother, they just got a response everyone gets if does something like this and can learn from it.\n\nMost people just make mistakes like this and learn the lesson, rather than get much older and not have no manners as everything been strictly defined before and they havent had to think. Learning to share and think of others are pretty early lessons. Mum being mildly miffed you both ate everything prepped in less time than it takes to finish showering a 3 year old, isn't anything for anyone to dwell on or feel like an asshole.", "INFO- can you give us the sequence of events as people have asked?
