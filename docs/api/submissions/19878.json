When we were annoyed about our chore and acted careless with e.g. the dishes and broke smthg - they took it from your pocket money (not if we were careful and had an accident, though). If we broke smthg from a sibling we could either make a deal with the sibling (trading smthg or doing their chores for a certain time) but if the sibling wanted the item replaced it came from our pocket money. We got pocket money every week and it was a set amount by age range. Oc when we were small and only got like 2$ per week they didn't make us pay the full amount of an item, but still enough that it hurt. \n\nThis way we learnt that if you do financial harm to others, you reimburse them, period. We also learnt if you want to spend your money on yourself, you better act careful with other ppls stuff. I do this till today.", "Thank you for the insight.

It would definitely be worth it to have a discussion with your kids about empathy here. \n\nThere are people on the thread who are telling you to just order food for your kids regardless of what they say.  \n\nMy brother is just like your kids- he said \u201cno\u201d to food all the time and constantly ate off my moms plate as a kid. It was cute then but now at 18 years old, he\u2019s just come to expect that he will eat others\u2019 food. Can\u2019t tell you the amount of times we have ordered pizza and he says he\u2019s not hungry just to eat an entire pizza and leave the rest of us to share one. Your kids have to learn to ask for what they want!\n\nThis is why I think NTA.", "You put a stop to this by firmly not letting them eat your food. They declined? Sorry, actions have consequences.

They get the food when it\u2019s delivered and eat it. \n\nThey\u2019re kids. They didn\u2019t know. And they were hungry.", "And there's the problem.  You can't be angry at them for eating a meal they didn't know was yours.  Typically a  salad is a side dish not a meal.", "Oh ffs, no it\u2019s not.  Many salads are a complete meal with protein, carbs and veggies all together.  There\u2019s no way these kids looked at that salad and thought it was theirs.  They just decided to be greedy and eat everything instead of waiting and asking.", "Hence why I said that OP should have told them that the salad was hers and ordered extra for them.  OP even asked the kids if they wanted more, it appeared that she suspected that what they ordered wouldn't have been enough. I know my kids, I know that I need to spell some things out to them (like \"the salad is mine, DO NOT EAT IT!\").  I know when they order if they will want more or not.", "NTA, but it's definitely worth having a discussion about it with your kids. When I was 11 (and my younger sibling was 9), I caught him trying to steal my share. I got super pissed about it at the time, but my brother was immediately apologetic.\n\nThe reaction coming coming from your kids is really odd imo. By 9-11, while they can act selfishly and impulsively, they *should* have a sense of what's right and wrong. I have little cousins of these ages, and I don't think I've ever seen them *that* completely unapologetic of their bad actions. \n\nI think you can start by sitting them down and letting them know how it would feel like for you and their sibling. Sure they were hungry, but then can't they empathise with their mom (who's been taking care of them all day, and don't even have time to cook) and little sibling not having anything to eat? Doesn't that sound selfish? What would they feel if their mom or other sibling ate all their food when they're starving?\n\n(But as an Asian, my mom would definitely not give me dinner as a lesson or something lmao. *That* way I'd definitely learn, but that's considered too cruel nowadays \ud83d\ude02)", "What did you order for the 11 & year olds? Because we all know just because they say they don't want anything now, that will change in 1/2 an hour.

That\u2019s so annoying and bad-mannered as it is. But to eat the food of their 3-year-old sibling who is now hungry and I have to find something else for them to eat\u2026 may even affect bed time timings if I don\u2019t have anything to hand. That would just make me livid. Kids got off light!", "You need to address this with them. Explain to them that when it is expected that certain foods are off limits, such as when some one buys a specific treat for themselves or when take out is ordered, and that they need to not touch without asking. Then you need to punish them when they do it. Kids can sometimes be thoughtless but they won't get better if you don't teach them", "They ate everything. Leaving nothing for younger sibling or mum. Knowing what's hers wouldn't matter. They should realise that two people can't eat if they eat all of what there is. That's the issue.", "Yes, because kids that age really don't think beyond themselves.  My kids would have done the same thing.  I would have told them before hand what was mine", "It doesn't sound like mum was exactly furious and raging at the event. Just let them know they should have been more considerate and less selfish. And when they absorb that after dealing with being kids and not wanting to take any fault initially, hopefully they'll have this thought every time there is takeout rather than needing everything listed each time. \n\nConsideration of others can absolutely be taught at the age they are. A day of being moody is fine and the kids will recover from not being handheld. Not eating more than you fair share, waiting a couple of mins or everyone to eat together etc are better lessons to work on than having to specify on who gets what each time.", "NTA. \n\nWhenever I get takeout with my son, he always *asks* if he\u2019d like to have something that he didn\u2019t ask to order for himself. He\u2019s *5*. If he can do it, kids twice his age can too. Hold them accountable.", "NTA for getting upset. Personally, I'd be less upset about them eating my food, it's them eating their siblings portion that would have upset me.\n\nBut... I also would have ordered food for them anyway, even if they said they're not hungry. Even if they didn't eat it when it comes, it can go in the fridge for later.\n\nThis is a learning experience for both you and your children.", "NTA\n\nIf they're that upset. Tell them to go on a hunger strike. Won't even last 2 meals.", "NTA. I would punish them they are old enough to know better", "YTA. When my kids think they are \"not hungry and don't want dinner\", I always make sure there is enough dinner for them anyway to eat when they inevitably do get hungry later. Worst case, you have leftovers for lunch the next day and that is pretty rare. Also, after 9 and 11 years together, you should have an idea of what your kids like and how much they eat. So when your kids said they were not hungry and refused to pick a meal, as the responsible adult, you should have ordered them a sufficiant meal each anyway. That is being a parent.", "Yes, these two definitely need punished and told it was wrong to eat food meant for someone else. But really, they are only 9 and 11 so of course they will be hungry later on. Just order them something. Completely different if these were kids in their mid teens but younger children don\u2019t think about being hungry later on refuse a meal order.", "I can\u2019t work out how to quote but you literally said in your post \u201cwe\u2019d been gone the majority of the day and by the time we got home it was too late to cook and we didn\u2019t have much except snack stuff\u201d so after you\u2019d been out at the shops getting Father\u2019s Day gifts you prioritised playing in sprinklers and having a shower over sorting out dinner for your kids ( I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t come home from the shops soaking so you must\u2019ve got wet at home), then ordered take out via your husband and didn\u2019t get food for all your kids, I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s on you as the adult.

Of which OP didn't communicate with the kids beforehand.", "I think eating bits of the wrong dish would have been ops fault entirely, even if understandable witj busy day and having to shower little one before. Eating everything and leaving nothing for little sibling or mum is something that shouldn't need communicating every time at 10 and would still require a conversation on that mistake even if mum wasnt specific. You start needing basic understanding of considering others and thinking a bit more at quite a young age \n\nMum can adjust and be more specific for a bit. But she didn't do anything wrong and wasn't crazy for thinking that kids that age shouldn't assume they get to eat literally everything and leave nothing for mum and little one. They were really hungry and temporarily selfish, it's not the end of the world to be called out and reflect on that. Didnt sound like they face the wrath of an evil mother, they just got a response everyone gets if does something like this and can learn from it.\n\nMost people just make mistakes like this and learn the lesson, rather than get much older and not have no manners as everything been strictly defined before and they havent had to think. Learning to share and think of others are pretty early lessons.

You don\u2019t need to make it a huge deal BUT you should do more to make it more of a lesson. \n\nTomorrow you and your husband should both probably sit them down together and further stress to them that what they did was wrong and that you are still disappointed in them. Explain to them how you went out of your way to take them to every store and shop that they wanted in order to get the perfect present for their dad. Explain that you love both them and your husband so much that you enjoyed shopping with them to get their dad a present, you did it out of love and empathy for them. Then explain how you doing that meant you didn\u2019t have time to get your own meal and you were really looking forward to having the salad last night. Stress to them that you asked multiple times if they wanted more to eat and they said no. Tell them how disappointing it was to you when you got out of the shower only to discover the meal you were looking forward to was eaten by them and how even more disappointing it was that they didn\u2019t seem to think what they did was wrong or even think twice about it. \n\nYou should 100% ask them why they thought it was okay to eat ALL of the food meant for not only you but their younger sibling. I feels it\u2019s really important to ask them this question. Get them to understand whatever thought process they had that eating your food was okay, was not right and maybe in the future they will think things through next time and make better decisions. Make them realize that whatever lead them to that conclusion was not the correct thought process and that in the future you really hope they will consider others feelings and NEEDS. Tell them you wanted the day to be special and so you loved taking them out to shop for their dad, but that it kind of hurt when you realized your children had eaten all of the food that was meant for you after the great day you had. \n\nAlso PLEASE  you NEED to 1000% address how they reacted to you being upset after they ate your food. Them being upset at YOU for how you felt for what THEY did absolutely needs to be talked about. If you allow them to have this mindset of them doing something wrong and then you having a reasonable reaction to it, and then they accuse you of overreacting?!?! Then they go into their room and cry so you can come in and tell them you\u2019re not mad at them. PLEASE don\u2019t let that be the end of it. That sets a BAD precedent. \n\nYou need to explain to them that your reaction was 100% reasonable and if anything they got off light for the disrespect they showed you and their lack of thoughtfulness for you and your youngest child. I\u2019d maybe even tell them that the fact they ate your food was disappointing, BUT their reaction to you after and how they made it seem like you\u2019re the bad guy who overreacted, I\u2019d honestly tell them that did in fact make you a little mad. The fact they felt they could get away with eating all of your food and then got mad at YOU for your reaction needs to be addressed and you need to make it clear that them reacting like that in not acceptable. That if they clearly did something they know is wrong and you react to it that they have NO right to act as if you\u2019re the one in the wrong. That\u2019s how you get manipulative and entitled kids. \n\nI think this is the PERFECT opportunity to let them learn a very valuable lesson about care and empathy towards others BUT you have to go about it the right way. If you allow them crying and you saying you\u2019re not mad to be the end of it, they won\u2019t learn much. If anything they will learn if they do something selfish and get in trouble they can cry and say you\u2019re overreacting and you will tell them you\u2019re not mad and that\u2019s the end of it, so I feel it\u2019s so important to sit them down and explain why you felt the way you did. \n\nAsk them why they thought it was okay to eat all of your food, tell them that it really disappointed you that they didn\u2019t consider you before they ate all of the food. Then tell them that what DID make you mad was their reaction to you being upset that they ate your food. Tell them it was highly inappropriate to say you were overreacting. They need to learn to be much for respectful of you and others in the future. You really need to ask them why they seriously thought it was okay to do. \n\nJust make it stick in their head and realize that what they did was really disrespectful and selfish of them to do. Don\u2019t yell don\u2019t scream don\u2019t even be \u201cmean\u201d about it. Just be stern and make it clear that even though this wasn\u2019t a \u201cserious\u201d situation, that they really hurt your feelings and disappointed you with both eating your food and then their reaction afterwards, as if it was no big deal to them what they did. You should let it be known to them they may not think it\u2019s a big deal, but to YOU it is and they should be aware of that and be more sensitive to other peoples feelings in the future. This is a great opportunity and age for them to take this lesson to heart. Wish you the best of luck! \n\nAlso I hope you update us if you do have the conversation I\u2019m suggesting to them. I\u2019d love to hear how it went. Give them a chance to really apologize to you after you all have a serious talk about it. Then tell them how much you love them and that you\u2019re not upset with them anymore but how you really hope they took what you said seriously and be more considerate in the future. Good luck OP.", "We did have food, just nothing prepared to easily have dinner. There are plenty snacks, fruits ect.. We were gone shopping about 4 hrs which tbh feels like all day with 3 kids.", "You were hungry but presumed they were not? You did not clearly communicate who the food you did order was for. You took a shower while knowing food was on the way. Food arrives. The two children see that there is food for two people, so they eat it. \nThey didn\u2019t do anything wrong. They can\u2019t read your mind. Apologize to them and do better in the future.", "Your brother is a rude AH. Record him saying no. Take the food from his hands from he goes to eat a WHOLE pizza after asking for nothing. What is wrong with your family that you still allow him to mess up everyones meals?", "I tell my daughter (4) that I trust that what she tells me is the truth; so I order her what she asks for. If she gets it and it isn't what she wants, then I tell her that I believed her, and I can not change it now.", "Poor thing didn\u2019t even really get alone time either! She was bathing WITH the 3 year old! So the comment you\u2019re replying to is even dumber when you take that into consideration. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t even getting to truly enjoy her shower (which is usually one of the only times parents get alone time) because she was also bathing the 3 year old. Guess what that means\u2026 she was \u201cdoing her job\u2026 to parent\u201d lol. As if leaving a 9 and 11 year old alone long enough to enjoy a shower is \u201cnot parenting\u201d. \n\nThey act like she was neglecting her kids when she didn\u2019t even get to bath by herself! She was still doing her job of \u201cparenting\u201d while also taking a bath!! \n\nI\u2019m gonna bet the person you replied to doesn\u2019t have kids lol, or if they do it\u2019s probably a not very involved parent and has the other parent doing all of the parenting so they are unaware of how silly their comment sounds.", "My husband called about 10 min after we got home and were playing outside. The sprinklers turned on while we were playing outside. Otherwise we wouldn't of had to take a shower.", "She said she took their orders and passed them along to the dad, which means they did get their own food?", "My son is 8. If there is one pizza left, one piece of candy left, one cookie left or WHATEVER he ALWAYS offers it to me or my husband before he eats it. You can tell he really bad wants to eat it himself and would probably be a bit disappointed if we did want it all for ourselves but he ALWAYS asks. \n\nEven if we say we don\u2019t want it and he can have it, he will wait a minute and then ask again if we are sure that we don\u2019t want any of it. Then when we assure him that he can have it all to himself he will happily take it and thank us. Normally even then he will stop half way through and offer us a bite before it\u2019s all gone just to be sure we don\u2019t want any. And if we ever say we do want some he always splits it with us if he knows we want it and never complains. \n\nI can\u2019t remember how long he\u2019s done this but its at least since he was 7 years old. He\u2019s an only child so that very well could be the reason he\u2019s that way and I know every child is different, BUT my point is that kids that young can in fact think of others and not just themselves. \n\nSometimes they may not be able to fully control their urges to act on it but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s alien to them. You can still be empathetic towards others while being a child.", "You understand that it\u2019s part of your job to feed your children. I don\u2019t care if they say they aren\u2019t hungry, you make sure there\u2019s dinner for them. So yes, YTA. And negligent to boot.", "NTA - now use their pocket money to order exactly what you and the 3 year old want - really nice and  eat it in Front of them - because they knew exactly what they were doing and how selfish it was - and they chose to do it anyway - this is a learning moment and you being annoyed is entirely appropriate.", "Going with NTA. 11 and 9 are old enough to know not to eat someone else's food. Especially the 11 year old.", "Order dessert, but none for them.", "was thinking the same thing while reading. if there is nothing else to eat in the house, OP should have definitively ordered something for all her kids...", "Do you know how easy it is to make your kid cry? You don\u2019t have to be screaming, yelling, or shaming them for them to cry. A lot of kids adore their parents so much that even a certain look of disappointment or obvious disapproval can make a child cry. If they feel they have done something to really upset someone they love, it usually makes them really upset as well and they will cry because they knew they did something wrong and now feel ashamed about it and they don\u2019t have many ways of dealing with their emotions yet so usually it will result in crying. \n\nGenuine question: Do you have your own children? I really hope you reply to this question. Because you made a lot of assumptions. Where in OPs post say ANYTHING about screaming at and shaming the kids? I didn\u2019t see that ANYWHERE in the post or the comments. Are you for real seriously assuming that just because they cried that meant she went all evil mom on them? Again do you have kids? Do you know how sensitive they can be? Do you know how easy it is to make a kid cry, even over something trivial? \n\nMy poor son is so sensitive that if he does something that HE thinks is wrong and that he THINKS we should be mad about he will cry immediately! Even when we tell him that it\u2019s not a big deal and that it was an accident or something along those lines. He will cry just at the thought of doing something that would disappoint us. \n\nGranted he\u2019s an only child and we have a very close bond and relationship with him (we do everything together always as a family) so he might be even more sensitive to stuff like that because we are so close and have such a strong relationship BUT it doesn\u2019t change the fact that kids will cry about a lot of things very easily. \n\nHeck when I was a kid half my pictures my mom took you could tell I had just been crying about something. I remember exactly why too. I was usually jealous of the \u201cboys\u201d getting to do something \u201cfun\u201d when in reality they were actually doing not so fun stuff, like working in tobacco fields and stuff like that, I just was crying because i felt it was unfair. I remember crying over such silly things as a kid. \n\nALOT of kids will cry when they get in trouble for something or when they THINK they are in trouble for something. No matter how small it might be, they are embarrassed and feel bad about doing something that upset their parents. \n\nThey don\u2019t know how to deal with their emotions yet or regulate their emotions yet, so the result ends with them crying. ANYTIME I \u201cgot in trouble\u201d I cried, every time because it was the only thing I knew to do in the situation because I knew I was wrong and I knew I upset my mom who I love dearly.", "Lol I definitely am not negligent. I got them all food about an hour before we came home.", "There has also been times where they order a bunch of food and don't eat it. I didn't want to tell my husband to order a bunch of stuff for it to just go to waste, that's why I asked them quite a few times if they were sure they didn't want anything else.", "NO!!! Then they'll grow up expecting mommy to always do that! Oh, HELL NO!!", "Did they eat the salad in 5 minutes?  That just seems really fast. Why wouldn\u2019t you order Vs husband?  They ate the salad instead of all the wings?  I\u2019m jealous my kids would not tear into and finish a Caesar salad.  You\u2019re a good mom for taking them all over for the shirt they wanted to get him. I hope he appreciates you and they do too.  There\u2019s nothing worst than expecting food and then it\u2019s not there.  And to see the empty container. I would yell too.", "Seriously! What they did would piss me off.", "Your parents need to get your brother\u2019s habit sorted out before he moves out, because the wider world will not be forgiving and he will likely face consequences should he steal food from the wrong person.", "They definitely are fast eaters so that part doesn't suprise me at all. All 3 of them love salads as well so I'm at least happy about that\ud83d\ude04 and dad had just happened to call and ask us if we wanted food because he knew we had been out so he ordered what I told him to", "My mother was round her friend\u2019s house when they were small and friend\u2019s mother asked what they wanted for tea. \u201cRaw sausages and sugar\u201d said friend.  So that\u2019s what they were given. Didn\u2019t happen again.", "Hahaha that's a good way to teach a child to say answer that question truthfully.", "Are you really asking for a judgment on what you said to your 9 and 11 year old because those children are upset with you for scolding them for their bad behavior?\n\nIf my kids reaction to getting in trouble was to say that I'm overreacting then they will continue to experience additional proper discipline\n\nNTA", "Well\u2026 they shouldn\u2019t have eaten the food you ordered for yourself & your other child. That\u2019s such a no-brainer I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s even a AITA post.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting sidetracked by \n\n1. You didn\u2019t have time to cook after you got home but you had time to wait for your husband to call & offer to order food and time to wait for it to be delivered\n\n2. You had time to wait for food that wasn\u2019t ordered until after you got home, but no time to hit a drive-thru on the way home or eat while you were out shopping \n\n2. You have three children but no food in the house besides snack stuff.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re penniless since you spent the day shopping & can afford to pay extra to have food delivered, so not a finances problem\u2026 it sounds like your trouble is w/ time management & priorities.\n\nYou might indeed be overreacting, if you\u2019re blaming them for making you & 3 y.o. go hungry. I hope you\u2019re just being over-dramatic by saying that they don\u2019t care if you \u201cget to eat\u201d.  You still have something you can feed your youngest child, right? If not, if you guys literally don't get to eat because they ate what you ordered, then you\u2019re massively YTA for spending the whole day shopping for gifts knowing that there\u2019s no food in your house.\n\nWhat they did was rude, yes, absolutely! No argument.  But if anyone is going hungry because of it, that\u2019s on YOU, not your children. Maybe learn to plan better.", "Obviously NTA. You parented your kids and let them know they were being selfish assholes, I don't know why you would think you're being the asshole here.", "ESH\u2026 I always order food for my 11 year old even if she says she doesn\u2019t want anything. Kids are fickle and maybe they did get hungry by the time the food came.", "Great response, OP! No snark, absolutely serious! \n\nKids will forever remember disappointing a mother and have empathy as a response more than if you had gotten angry!! \n\nMichael Lewis\u2014the author of The Big Short, The Blind Side, etc.\u2014said that the theme of the one person who did the right thing over everyone around them was that each of these whistleblowers said that they heard their mother\u2019s voices in their heads, and thought about how disappointed their mothers would have been in them if they continued. \n\nTo repeat, you did a great job!", "But the only food in the house was \u201csnack stuff\u201d.
