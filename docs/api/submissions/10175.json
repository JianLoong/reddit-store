You know better. Everyone knows better.", "Oooh YTA. Friends like you give genuine friends a bad name. I wouldn't even call you a friend to be honest. You're a flash in the pan, all for the chance of getting some D. Only when the D is gone who do you have to fall back on. Not the friend you let down if she has any self respect that's for sure. Hope this D is enough for a lifetime", "Friend, you didn't just ditch her for a dude you just met (AH move), you ditched her on a holiday that was important that she not be alone (AH move, 2x), AND you ditched her in a strange town where she doesn't know anyone.\n\nYTA all the way.", "So let me get this straight. You chose to ditch your friend who you had made plans with MONTHS ahead of time, all for a guy who you met on a plane? The guy who basically invited you to his place after only a few hours of knowing you? How do you see or think that you aren\u2019t TA. Dude YTA BIGTIME.", "YTA, this was something you two had planned for a while and you ditched at the very last second for a guy you just met? Why couldn\u2019t have just gotten the guy\u2019s number, and planned something with him after your trip like a normal person?", "\u201cHey I know I said I would emotionally support you on a tough day for you but I can\u2019t do that anymore, I\u2019m chasing dick.\u201d YTA, obviously.", "Come on be honest. You ditched a friend in hopes of getting some even if you didn't get any? The intention is there in the least whether it was that night or many nights later.  Why else would you ditch a friend? Otherwise you would've invited said friend along to join in the fun with your new friend. If this is repetitive behaviour then neither of you are worthy of friend status", "YTA. Come on, you know you did the wrong thing", "YTA.  Did your parent(s) not teach you that you can\u2019t break a date/ plans because something you judge better comes along?  You had long standing plans with your friend and she was hoping for them to cheer her in the absence of her boyfriend.  You could have seen the new guy before or after, explained the situation and asked for an alternative date\u2014ANYTHING but ditching someone who was counting on you!", "YTA. You already had plans. You could\u2019ve hung out with the guy on another night, but you chose valentine\u2019s day.", "YTA", "YTA but you clearly will never admit that you did anything wrong so I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re wasting time here. You are very young, clearly pretty immature and self-centered. Hopefully you will gain empathy and personal integrity as you get older.  Or not, entitled assholes are a dime a dozen so what\u2019s one more.", "YTA and even more, because you feel the need to discuss with every other comment.", "Info: Did your friend know anyone else in California? Or did you leave her alone in a strange city?", "YTA - you unilaterally canceled for plans new ones. The sends the message that you value you romantic opportunities more than your friendship. If you do, ok \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nHad you asked your friend if it\u2019s ok to reschedule than I\u2019d vote differently. This version is more respectful. You at least give the person you made plans with an opportunity weigh in on the decision. She felt rejected and replaceable. A conversation could have at least acknowledged her feelings and demonstrated you care about her before ditching her. \n\nInstead you announced \u201chey someone better came along. Bye! \u2026Wait, why you mad?\u201d \n\nThen saying \u201cI\u2019ll still go on the trip with you\u201d after this incident come as across like better you don\u2019t have anything better to do. \n\nPersonally if you did this to me, I wouldn\u2019t trust you. You\u2019ve proven that you\u2019ll will ditch me if a \u201cbetter\u201d opportunity comes along. That makes you a huge liability on a trip.", "YTA obviously. You had plans and then ignored them. You left your friend who you went on the trip with alone because you found a penis.", "YTA.  Your friend was already vulnerable because of her boyfriend not being able to come.  Instead of spending Valentine's Day with her friend to take her mind off of her boyfriend not being there, she spent it alone, while you spent it with a fling.  TL;DR you prioritized a fling over your friend.", "YTA thinking with your dick and all that.  I mean I don't blame you for being into somebody, but you couldn't wait a day?", " YTA gross behaviour", "YTA. Also you are very immature.", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s in your first sentence. You traveled with your friend. You made plans with your friend.

Uteruses before Duderuses.", "YTA\n\nYou went on vacation with your friend and spent your time texting / hanging out with someone else.

You made plans with a friend and then cancelled those plans because you met someone new on a plane. Your friend feels hurt, and tbh I have seen friendships end over things like this.\n\nYou basically conveyed to your friend that you care less about her time than time with this new person.", "Lmao Yta, you suck as a friend. You have \"feelings\" for someone you know some days, and you just ditched your friend for a dick appointment.\n\nHope she just ditch you as a friend, you arent reliable at all", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nYour a bad friend. \n\nYTA,  for coming here to ask then refusing to acknowledge yta..... \n\nGrow up or grow old and lonely.   YTA", "YTA. I swear, based on the many posts of read lately, some of you have been raised with horrible manners. You and your friend planned this trip for awhile and you ditched her in a strange place to hang out with a stranger. Have you no sense of friendship, loyalty or pride? We\u2019re you raised to always be this selfish?", "YTA- do you even need to ask?", "YTA and a shitty friend.", "YTA", "YTA what friend? Oh you mean the person you once knew but traded in for a guy looking for a holiday hook up.", "YTA. OMG, you are young. So you dumped your friend at the beginning of a trip you'd planned together because you had \"feelings for\" a guy you'd made aimless chat with for a while. Seriously, that's contemptible, also stupid. And selfish. And also dangerous. There definitely is one born every minute!", "So I\u2019m curious, had the boyfriend come, would you have been alone on Valentine\u2019s Day?

However, if her Bf had turned up on valentine's day, 100% she'd expect you to understand, and leave you in the lurch.\n\nIf you are spending everyday and night with a friend, and you meet someone, it shouldn't be a deal breaker that you go do something with the date one night out of a whole trip...  As a friend, if I wasn't getting a date on valentines, but a friend I was with had the opportunity, yes I'd be jealous, yes I'd feel like a spare part, and yes I'd feel pushed out, but I'd still say they could go, cause I wouldn't want to Rob them of let's face it, a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\nId also. Resolve to do stuff on my own if need be thereafter, because shit is what is is.  I don't mind doing stuff only I want to do though.  Some people can't move unless they are accompanied.\n\nI get why you went, I get why she felt left out., but theirs no way she wouldn't have ditched you if her Bf turned up, so she has no right to be sulky.  She has a partner, as a friend if you got the chance of forging a lovers relationship, she's self to think she should take priority. \n\nNta", "Yeah YTA. You abandoned your friend while you\u2019re on vacation alone together? For a guy? With friends like you, she won\u2019t need enemies. I hope she does okay with her first solo vacation.", "NTA\n\nIf you had been with her 24/7 while traveling in CA, and you wanted one evening off to do your own thing (yes, even an evening that you had made previous plans with her), I think that\u2019s totally reasonable.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s a big girl. It\u2019s ok to do things separately even on a joint trip. You should at least empathize that it probably wasn\u2019t fun to spend Valentine\u2019s Day alone but at 23 in California she had every opportunity to go make it fun for herself. I don\u2019t know your friend but I\u2019d be willing to bet if she met an attractive new stranger on an airplane that wanted to spend the night with her she\u2019d at the very least be tempted. Take her on a friend date in Tahoe", "NAH for wanting to follow up with this guy.\n\nUnknown, though, are the words and tone with which you broke the news to your friend.\n\nIt seems to me, the less you validated your friend's feelings of abandonment, the more is your rising AH score.", "It's okay to be selfish sometimes. But you better marry him", "I mean I didn't really ditch her, I told her two days before valentines day", "Why does everyone assume we had sex? also how have I been a bad friend, my friend has ditched/ghosted me like 20 times already", "I mean we decided to hang out on like valentines day only like a few days ago so its not really months ago", "we were leaving for Lake Tahoe tomorrow so I couldnt really plan something another day", "how was she counting on me?", "I didnt prioritize him over my friend. I still would go on the trip with my friend.", "At the time she thought she had those \"feelings\" she'd talked to him for what, an hour?", "telling her any time after the plans are made is ditching her.", "You guys were on a trip TOGETHER and had plans and you blew her off for a dude you just met.

So yeah, YTA.", "that\u2019s exactly what you did. you had a choice- to hang out with your friend or hang out with a stranger. you chose the stranger, you prioritized the stranger.

How did you graduate without knowing the meaning of that word?", "I know some people that will leave you dying, so they can just go on a date with anyone.", "I mean like I told her, so like she was warned so how would it be ditching her", "No, just you.

Now your ex friend", "Because you were the friend she took a vacation with. But she\u2019s your ex-friend now, so have fun with random airplane dude.", "Beats me. I can't see why ANYone would need you, now that you've proved who you are."]}
