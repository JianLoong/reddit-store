She isn't someone you employed to wait around endlessly until you're bored and have nothing better to do. She's tired of being treated as disposable.

Here's the deal: \n\nHer boyfriend ditched her to do whatever else. Maybe it was for a good reason. Maybe not. The bottom line is that she's alone on a major planned trip and on a major romantic holiday. She's feeling very lonely right now and probably also like she's been rejected. \n\nThen you turn around and *also* ditch her for a guy you've known for about a minute. It doesn't matter if you are getting feelings, to her it comes across like yet another loved one ditching her for something else, despite making a promise to her. This takes those feelings of rejection, depression, and loneliness and amps it up to eleven.\n\nIn a way, that's going to hurt even worse because she'd gotten her hopes up and had probably made plans for the two of you to go trip the bestie lights fantastic. Plans that she may not feel safe doing by herself. \n\nAlso as far as the guy goes, you have no idea if this will actually work out. You presumably live states/hours away from each other. LDRs typically don't work out, even with all of the advances in technology that have made it far easier than it once was. Plus you don't know if he actually wants a relationship or if he's just telling you what you want to hear to get you into bed or have a fun little fling. You knew him for what, a few hours on the plane and a couple of days of texting?
