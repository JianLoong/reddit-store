As your brother, he is welcome to spend all the time he wants with your son, unpaid.", "$25 an hour to make sure a ten year old doesn't do something stupid, and, oh yeah, it's actually his nephew, is NOT, in fact, reasonable.", "So he only sees your kid when he\u2019s babysitting, not ever at family meals and events? If he\u2019s not going to be paid he will just refuse to spend time with your nephew?", "If it\u2019s no longer work8ng for your ex then you guys need to reevaluate the Drew situation", "You should put that in an edit", "What happens when your kid finds out you pay his uncle to hang out with him?", "I think it makes sense to get a new baby sitter. If you were just talking about a random person as the sitter\u2026the weekly minimum wouldn\u2019t be as big of an issue. Since he\u2019s your brother\u2026you\u2019re pushing for something that\u2019s unrealistic/unfair to your ex.", "The guy is his uncle, and he's getting paid for hours he's not even working. Sorry, mom is allowed to find someone cheaper", "That won't happen", "No she can't pick a sitter by herself", "He's been her sitter too", "Idk if I would say that. Op's ex should find another option anyway to get herself out of that situation. However OP asked for judgement on not paying Drew for time unused and I don't think he is based on the provided info.\n\nI do however think drew is taking advantage of the situation to try and get guaranteed hours in a job field where guaranteed hours don't exist.", "You don't hire cheap for a sitter", "Yea, that's the way it sounded to me as well. That's fucked and will not work in the long term.", "That's not his call if she's paying for it.", "I will veto her choice and she won't have childcare at all. She'll run back to back to Uncle Drew and he'll tell her to go fuck herself", "Then I won't agree to hers and she needs childcare more than me so I win.", "I had not seen that at the time. That definitely makes him the ass. However, I stand by my statement that objectively having GH and choosing how you utilize them is a normal business arrangement.\n\nThat being said, unobjectively,  I hope his ex takes him back to court for this blatant manipulation.", "He's practically an *uncle* to the kid!", "2k a month. And it\u2019s 25 hours on her weeks and 15 (the minimum on Oo\u2019s) so 80 hours a month. It adds up.", "Pretty sure $25x3 is $75. So his weeks are $375 with the 15 hr minimum. Hers are $625 for her 25hrs. So he is costing $750 of the childcare expenses while her time is $1250", "He spends more time with him than most uncles", "I'm sure there's plenty of quality sitters willing to work for $10 an hours", "Then YTA", "And neither can you. If she decides Drew is gone, then he's gone and you'll both need to hire another one.  If you act unreasonable, she'll have you right back in court asking for the judge for the power to solo choose a sitter.", "why not?", "OP *wants* Drew paid for 15 hours, even though he only worked 2 hours.", ">Op's ex should find another option anyway to get herself out of that situation.\n\nOP refuses to accommodate that.", "Paying a great sitter for 5 hours is less money than paying a great sitter for 15 hours. That comment is purposely obtuse.", "It shouldn\u2019t be but he\u2019s commented that they both have to agree on a sitter and replacing drew \u201cwon\u2019t happen.\u201d", "There you go, YTA.  I don't think you could even argue against it.", "So basically you don\u2019t want your child to be properly cared for? I hope she finds this post and takes you back to court", "Aaaaand here\u2019s the real OP. YTA it\u2019s very obvious now.", "You are saying that you will veto any sitter who isn't your brother?", "The judge is gonna laugh you out of court when he hears the whole story, you moron", "And she'll Veto Drew and you'll end up back in court. I suspect, once the judge or mediator finds out that you're trying to force your ex to overpay for your own brother, she'll adjust the agreement to give your ex the right to choose someone else. You're the AH, starting with thinking watching your own kid is somehow doing your ex a favor", "Well, aren\u2019t you a spiteful little man.   I\u2019m sensing she left you\u2026..\n\nAlso, courts love it when you mess with childcare.   Judges eat that shit up.", "Good luck with that, that's a great way to get your legal custody revoked.", "What a fuckin weird thing to say. YTA", "Oh hell no. You are a manipulative and disgusting creature. Your ex needs to take your ass to court.", "YTA!!!!", "Man, I hope the internet finds your ex and sends her the screenshots.", "And there is the real you. You don't get to veto shit, Dude. Her house, her rules and her choices for her time with her son. You are awful and I hope to God she finds this post and reports your BS to the courts. Be a better person. The one you are now lacks integrity and is clouded by ego.", "Oof, you just couldn't hold it together and try not to show your true colors, could you??", "So you\u2019re deliberately trying to be an asshole. Got it", "YTA. A big one. I also hope she finds this post and takes you back to court, because you\u2019re an abusive immature little man.", "Why don't you just look after him as his parent for the extra hours she needs and save more money for your child? Then your brother could find another family to work with.", "You sound like a child. You win?", "You really are an insufferable ass. You\u2019re just trying to screw over your ex.", "Is that what this is about?? Winning? Because if it is you are definitely TA. \n\nYou should be modelling good problem solving for your kid. Not trying to be the victor in your conflict with your ex. \n\nThat should be obvious.", "Ew", "If it\u2019s a prize for most petty ex than you definitely win.", "It doesn't fucking matter who \"wins\", dammit. What matters in this case is doing what's best for the kid. Idgaf what the hell your beef is with your ex, but get your shit together and work out what is best for your son. Not what's best for you, not what's worst for your ex, not what's best for your brother. What's best for your kid. You shouldn't even have custody of your kid if you're focused on who's \"winning\".", "Or you lose custody because you are a massive prick who puts \"winning\" and trying to force your wx to pay your brother for service he's not providing over the best interests of your fucking child.", "You win what? Jesus, you're pathetic.", "My logic was basically that he put the fact that Drew was his brother as an afterthought at the end, and that if OP was acting in good faith, then he would have said that Drew was his brother at the beginning. Saying \"Andrew has a sitter...who's been with us for five years\" heavily implies that Drew is just some random babysitter and I would argue is intentionally misleading. It would have made much more sense to say \"We pay my brother Drew to babysit Andrew.\" Since OP acted in bad faith writing the story, I figured he was also acting in bad faith with his ex.", "way to not answer the question directly.", "Because he's paid to show up. Seems like he'd stop coming around your child if yiur ex weren't paying him.", "Because he's paid to. \n\nYour ex needs to take you to court and get that order changed. \nA teenager down the street would do it for 10 bucks an hour.", "Believe me, there aren\u2019t. Maybe ten years ago. The 14 year old across the street charges $12 an hour for one kid, five for each additional. The girl I used to use who was a little older and could drive herself and stay late (past midnight) was $15 an hour. And this is all over five years ago.", "But she needs childcare way more than I do. I work from home.", "Because I work from home and she doesn't plus she has a nasty commute.", "The agreement for like 5 years has been he gets a 15 hour minimum.

Sickening behavior on the part of a father.", "\u201cAll I care about is screwing my ex over even if it hurts my child.

Or even *gasp* an after-school program! \n\nShe doesn't need to employ your brother.", "that doesn't answer the question of why she can't pick a sitter.", "No, she isn't. She's *losing* $750. $650 if you count the 4 or so hours you would need a sitter for on your time.", "The argument that this has been going on for 5 years works against you. Don't forget, your child has also matured **5 years** in that time and no longer requires such intensive monitoring. \n\nDrew is no longer needed. It makes more sense to let him go than to pay him to do... whatever he does when he's not working.", "Because op is an asshole"]}
