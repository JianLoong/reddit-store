She would bully me (17M) since I was 13, usually just call me names and make snide remarks, but one time she made fun of my dead mother, which is the one that stuck in my head for so long. It was constant and relentless bullying and made me feel low and inferior.\n\nShe stopped at 16, my guess was because her father died in a car accident and realized how she made me feel. Though she never apologised.\n\nSo she got terminal cancer and made some big post on her social media and got lots of attention. When saw me in school she was tearful and apologised for how she treated me.\n\nHonestly, I felt nothing. I said \"I don't accept your apology, nor do I offer you my sympathies\" and walked away, I could hear her cry even more. \n\nMy friends agree with what I did but all her friends gave me shit. I try to ignore them when I see them but they just come at me like rabid animals and say stuff that I should say sorry and that I'm an asshole. When her mother confronted me on what I said, telling me that I should've at least offered sympathy because she's dying, I only said \"Just means I no longer need to deal with her.\" I blocked them all on social media. Idk maybe I was too harsh, but if I'm being honest I don't feel sympathy for her. I worked through my resentment with a therapist and honestly, I feel.nothing for her.

So she was awful to you for years but now she\u2019s dying all should be forgiven? Sorry but it doesn\u2019t work like that. She can\u2019t erase the years of hurt and torment she made you suffer. You are perfectly within your rights to say 'I don\u2019t accept your apology'. Personally I would have said 'I\u2019m glad you\u2019re sorry, but I still don\u2019t forgive you'.

She is dying at a very young age and she is realizing that she screwed up and is trying to make it right.  You don't have to accept that if you don't want to, but you could change your response a little bit and in ways that would maintain your boundaries without continuing the bad feelings.\n\n\"Thank you for apologizing (does not mean you accept her apology, but still acknowledges the effort she made to make it).  I'm not in a place to accept that apology, and I don't really welcome interactions with you.  I understand that you are going through a difficult time, so it is probably best to expend your energy on people that you haven't harmed the way you've harmed me.

She learned a lesson about being mean  when her father died, and is now learning one about humility.  You don't have to forgive what she used to do to a accept the apology. It just means you appreciate that she now understands it was wrong and is sorry for having done it. \nNothing will change the fact that the bullying hurt you. Do your best to heal and let it be in the past. \n\nBecause you know what pain is, perhaps you can learn to feel compassion for others in pain.

If you said these things unprompted, YWBTA, but they're asking questions they don't like the answer to. If you're apologizing to someone with the expectation that they accept it and relieve you of your guilt, you're not apologizing for the right reasons.", "NTA OP. You have the right to refuse her apology and refuse to forgive her for what she did to you. Her friends and mother need to back off and leave you alone. \n\nYou stand your ground OP. I agree with one of the commenters who said she is only sorry because she is dying. She just wants the apology so that she won't be shaking in her boots when her Maker asks her why she was bully when she was alive in the mortal realm and she thinks your apology will let her off the hook with her Maker\n\nRemember this: an apology cannot be forced and demanded. Choosing to not forgive your bullies does not make you a bad person", "NTA, I\u2019ve never understood the notion of someone dying and they\u2019re suddenly a saint.

As you get older, I hope you come to realize that sometimes outer behavior is due to inner torment. It's hard to believe, but in many cases, the bully is more insecure and screwed up, than even we feel. They just have a crappy way of dealing with it. It does speak, I think to their true personality. You said the girl stopped after her father died? I think she had already realized the pain of her actions. She should have apologized, sadly she didn't til this twist of fate. But your forgiving her has nothing to do with her. It is about you. HEALING AND MOVING ON. You don't owe her your forgiveness, you just owe it to yourself. If you get up in the morning and look yourself in the mirror and say, I'm good with it. It's who I am, then that's all that matters.

You don't always have to be pragmatic in life, sometimes you just have to be a human and show sympathy even when you think that person doesn't deserve it.

Do you really think an apology erases 3 years of that?\"  \n\nFor the mom, it might have been better to just clear the air and say, \"Are you aware that your daughter was basically a monster to me during the most vulnerable years of my life?

What do you think the proper resolution of that situation is?

What are you doing about that?\"", "NTA. I was relentlessly bullied almost the entire time I was in school and it changes how you feel about people.

We didn't have a great relationship and when he first got diagnosed, it was so frustrating because it felt like there was a lot of pressure to automatically forgive him for everything that he'd done or even treat him with any grace.

You definitely DID NOT get to the point in therapy where you feel nothing over the bullying you experienced. You're in a state of hatred & loathing that caused you to react cruelly here, especially to the mother. I understand that, in your anger, that you are probably feeling pretty good about your response. After all, you made the person who used to bully you suffer like you did.

Of course they don't deserve.\n\nMy father spent my whole childhood beating me, telling me I was going to hell, he would describe to me the hell every night and how I would burn, he would beat me so hard I wasn't allowed to take my shirt off in public because of all the marks I had, he broke my arm when I was 8, he would throw me on the ground and kick me when I was a pre-teen. When I was 12 he gave poison to my dog and laughed while I cried watching her die, he would systematically kill every dog I was attached to from that point on. He just stopped hitting me because I started fighting back and by the age of 15 I was almost the same size as him (he is a coward).\n\nWe got into a physical fight, I won the fight and then I forgave him.\n\nI used to think about him ALL THE TIME, all the time I was thinking 1000's of ways of him dying. When I finally forgave him, he became nothing, just a pathetic piece of shit, he didn't matter anymore. I used to spend my whole day hating him, wishing every type of bad thing to happen to him. Since I forgave him I barely even remember he exists and it is the best thing that happened to me, because he has no power over me anymore. He is not my problem anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't believe you should forgive someone just because you are told, you should forgive because YOU WANT to do it. It is something that must come from inside of you, not because someone is telling you to do. Also forgiving doesn't mean forgetting.", "People use it on this sub all the time to justify unwarranted cruelty in return to some action. It\u2019s definitely overused", "\"op's bully is an evil person for making fun of op's mum's death but also the bully's dad deserved to die for the actions of his daughter\"\n\nhe who fights with monsters and all", "OP might have regrets later in life if they decide to forgive their bully at this moment just because their bully is dying.", "But she already has started to mature into a better person. She stopped the bullying, she gained empathy after experiencing her dad's death, she recognizes she did wrong and is trying to make amends.  I won't invalidate OPs feelings. He went through a hard time and she was awful to him. He doesn't need to forgive her or even make her feel better...., but I do think his behavior is callous. You can be detached without being cruel.  I just hope when he grows and matures more he doesn't look back on his reaction with regret.", "So because she didn't actively bully OP, OP is obligated to forgive her? I have no problem with people feeling sympathy for the bully, but acting like OP was in the wrong for they reacted is just completely uncalled for. Grieving people are always called on to be the bigger person and it's infuriating and ridiculous. It's super easy for people to sit back from afar and sit on their high horse and tell people to \"be the bigger person\" when they didn't have to actually deal with the pain and trauma of the situation. When you're actually in it, sometimes what OP said is literally the nicest thing you can muster at that moment. OP was not vindictive, as most comments are claiming, they were just fed up with the whole situation. Now the baggage of this soon-to-be-dead bully is also on their plate when they didn't ask for any of this. And the bully and her family demanding forgiveness was completely uncalled for and what led to the harsher words that came later.", "oh yeah, that's a good one. iT's ThE hArDeSt JoB iN tHe WoRlD\n\ni've been a sahm, working mother is much fucking harder. and if you're at home while your partner is out doing long, physical days, they're not 'weaponising incompetence' when they suggest that you cook dinner", "Yeah, I guess I was kinda hoping for one good person in the family.

Simply acknowledge the act, perhaps forgive herself as well for still hating her.  Forgive herself for likely wishing her dead.  \n\nI heard a child very much hurt and feeling guilty about her actions when I read this.   I feel like she does not know how to process these feeling and that is normal. \n\nJust my opinion", "Was downvoted into oblivion because I disagree with someone who said: \u201cNo matter what job the person leaving the house is doing, it\u2019s not as hard as the person who\u2019s staying home.\u201d", "Forgiveness that is forced isn't going to help her deal with this at all either. Now that friends and family of the bully are harassing her, OP is most likely never going to actually be able to forgive her bully or have closure, which is unfair to her.
