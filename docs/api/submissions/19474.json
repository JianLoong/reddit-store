Her mother Nancy (38) remarried 3 years ago and has a stepdaughter Kay who\u2019s also 14. \n\nI\u2019m not rich but I\u2019m doing quite well financially. As Emma\u2019s only living paternal relative, I have set aside money to take care of her. This is mostly in the form of paying for Emma\u2019s violin and language lessons, something Leo started. Nancy works but can\u2019t afford these lessons on her own. Her husband also works but he has to pay child support for Kay\u2019s half siblings (from the marriage prior to Kay\u2019s mother) so I don\u2019t expect much from him.\n\nI never really bought Emma expensive gifts as I know that will create resentment with Kay. For birthdays and Christmas I usually give books and school related stuff. Boring, I know, but Emma is studious and she loves them. However, this summer, as a reward for making the highest honor roll at her school, I decided to take Emma on a vacation with me to Japan. My work place sent me over there for some QC and then I took vacation time after. Emma stayed with me and my assistant took care of her when I was busy; it was a great two weeks. We returned home happy with plenty of souvenirs for Emma\u2019s family.\n\nA couple days ago Emma called me, upset. Every summer her family goes on a family trip together for a week or so. This summer, however, Nancy and her husband decided not to go and used the money set aside for the trip to redecorate Kay\u2019s room instead, claiming that Emma already has her getaway in Japan with me. Nancy told Emma they will do her room next summer.\n\nI called and told Nancy she wasn\u2019t being fair in how she treated Emma. Nancy told me that Kay wasn\u2019t lucky enough to have some rich aunt taking care of her needs so she was trying to even things out for Kay. I thought that reasoning was BS but Nancy said I was spoiling Emma.

Emma got a trip to Japan, Kay gets to have her dad be alive. The two aren\u2019t even remotely comparable. It\u2019s certainly not fair. I\u2019m honestly also baffled by the responses here when usually with blended families reddit is quick to tell parents sometimes the other side of one kids family gives them more and it\u2019s reality etc\u2026 imagine how much most support the op would be getting if they were the family of a divorced parent, when here it\u2019s so much worse because the dad isn\u2019t there to provide for his daughter. Also I call bs on them doing Emma\u2019s room next year. What, so no holiday next too to cover the cost of Emma\u2019s room? I highly doubt it. I think Emma\u2019s mum is entirely in the wrong to over compensate Kay when, once again, Emma is only getting these things because her dad is dead.", "I do NOT understand all the y-t-a comments. Your niece lost her father, what are they doing to even up that score? NTA", "NTA. Why? Well simply put you decided to take your blood niece on a trip (YOUR BLOOD) and have some family bonding time, but then because you took your own blood relative on a vacation, her mother/step father decide to cancel the anual family vacay to redo kays room, all because you decided you wanted to have some family time. What did they expect you to take kay as well who has 0 relation to you in any way you have no obligations to that mans child and yet it seems like they are trying to make you feel guilty that \u201ckay doesent have a rich aunt\u201d. They could have still gone on vacation they were just being petty I assume kay probably threw a temper tantrum about how she doesent get to goto japan and so they wanted to make her feel better. Again not your blood not your family so to me i dgaf about kays feelings here.", "NTA your niece lost her father no holidays can make up for it.", "INFO: \n\nCan you expand on why you feel that Nancy and husband redecorating Kay\u2019s room instead of taking a family vacation is unfair to Emma? Given that they plan to do the same for Emma next year, and aren\u2019t taking a vacation without Emma, I mean.\n\nIs it because you don\u2019t believe they will follow through? Do you feel that Emma is entitled to a second vacation this summer? Do you feel that Nancy should just accept that Emma might get extra over Kay?", "NTA. Idk maybe Kay\u2019s dad should die too, to even it up", "Wait, why was your assistant babysitting on a business trip? That\u2019s not cool.", "Unpopular opinion, but it sounds like the mother resents what the OP is providing for her daughter and the redecoration plan of one kid's room is a spite move.  (Who thinks there's a chance she won't do Emma's room next year or ever because \"rich aunt\" gives Emma violin lessons or whatever & she has to even things out?) \n\nWhy doesn't the mom say that they're not doing a family vacation so they can save money to decorate BOTH girls' rooms the following year?  Or do both rooms now in a less expensive way?\n\nBut OP, you do need to back off.  You don't want the mom to restrict what you can do for Emma because she's mad at you.\n\nNTA", "YTA, it's not like the whole family is going somewhere and they're excluding her, they're all missing out on a trip. Your niece already got to enjoy a trip that her stepsister wont", "INFO I don't understand the problem. No one is going on vacation so it's not like they are punishing Emma. It seems like a odd choice by the parents (why would they give up the chance to travel and decorate a room instead?) but definitely not worth raising a stink about.\n\nI'd also think being about to have an assistant babysit your neice on a trip to Japan puts you firmly in the rich category.", "YTA. They're doing one room this summer and one room next summer. If they can't afford to do both rooms this year, that seems fair enough since Emma did get to go on a big trip even if it was with you rather than them.\n\nYou need to butt out, honestly.", "NTA - however if none of the family is going on the trip your niece is not being singled out.  It would be different if they told her they were taking Kay to Disney, but she couldn\u2019t go because she had gone to Japan.", "I wouldn't say that you're the AH but I would say that you need to be more understanding. You need to look at it from all perspectives how do you think Kay felt that Emma went to Japan I know that's your niece but all kids see is that one is going away and one isn't. The family canceled their summer vacation this year and used that to decorate Kay's room probably to make it up to her for not going to Japan. They said that Emma will get her room done next year which is fair. This is a tricky situation for the parents involved they are trying to be fair to both kids and you need to respect that and support their decisions,", "NTA", "NAH. \nYou feel protective of your niece, and took her abroad for 2 weeks (I wish I had an aunt like that) and her sister got a souvenir, and as cool as that might have been, your niece got life experience and memories, so it\u2019s fair that the sister got some memories too, and it\u2019s not like they are refusing to also redecorate her bedroom, it\u2019s just that things are expensive. \nI feel kinda sorry for Nancy and her husband who didn\u2019t get a trip or a redecor in their bedroom \ud83e\udd2a", "> Nancy and her husband decided not to go and used the money set aside for the trip to redecorate Kay\u2019s room instead, claiming that Emma already has her getaway in Japan with me. \n\nWhat makes this NTA is due to the reasoning. If Emma's mom didn't throw Emma's trip to Japan as a reason why (1) the family isn't going on vacation; & (2) her room isn't getting decorated to ensure things are \"even\" since Emma was taken to Japan, I would go opposite. Emma's mom made her feel terrible and OP was rightfully upset for her trip to be used against the niece. IMHO.", "NTA \n\nThis is unfair and let Nancy know that when Emma is old enough she will have a room at your house, she\u2019s gonna need it.", "NTA! good grief!  You have a longterm relationship with your dead brothers child and you are her living connection to him! It's unfortunate that her family isn't in the position to do both a remodel and a trip...and it may be they can't afford the trip and are using you as an excuse?   It's on them if they continue to resent you and then get butthurt because your niece moves in with you.", "NTA.", "NTA. Emma\u2019s dad, your brother, has passed - that means you are each other\u2019s last connection to him, if I\u2019m reading the situation properly? Meanwhile, Kay has two living parents AND a stepmom who clearly cares for her. It is not comparable. I get that Kay is 14 and it\u2019s natural that she\u2019s probably envious of what Emma gets from you, but it\u2019s up to her parents to explain that you have every right to \u201cspoil\u201d your niece (heavy quotes because I don\u2019t think music lessons and a vacation are actually spoiling). I also think it would\u2019ve been more understandable if your SIL\u2019s decision was to save the vacation money for this year and do both girls\u2019 rooms next year at the same time. I think the framing of all of this comes off very sticky, like it\u2019s a punishment for Emma.", "NTA. You\u2019re being nice to your niece who is going through life without a dad. You\u2019ve gone out of your way to make sure that Emma doesn\u2019t get extravagant presents that will make Kay feel jealous for the most part. Emma\u2019s mother should be grateful.", "YTA\n\nEmma isn't entitled to a family trip if that's not how her parents decide to spend the money. It sounds like they're going to spend the money this year on Kay's room and next year will be her turn. This sounds fair since Emma *did* get a trip to Japan and Kay didn't.", "ESH. The \u201cone room now, one room next year\u201d is a reasonable way to do it. If Emma got a big trip and her room first, Kay would throw a fit and sometimes as parents we need to keep peace. Emma isn\u2019t being deprived. \n\nHowever your sister in law is an asshole for saying Kay isn\u2019t \u201clucky enough to have a rich aunt.\u201d Kay is lucky enough to have two living parents. As between the two I think that trumps things.", "YTA\n\nLet the stepsister have this one. Your niece will get her room decorated next year.\n\nINFO: do you get Kay anything? Even just a small trinket related to her hobbues will go a long way.", "I don't know. I think you're NTA, but I don't understand what your SIL is saying. Is there more?", "NTA. I lost my father when I was very young, so I totally understand this situation. The stepsister has TWO ALIVE PARENTS AND A STEPPARENT. Nothing OP does will make up for that. The stepsister will have her dad be there for her graduations, walk with her if she makes homecoming, be there for daddy-daughter outings, walk her down the aisle for her wedding\u2026 those are irreplaceable and being jealous over an aunt with money trying to bond with her niece is insane.", "YTA.\n\nYou should start to mind your own business when it's not about your money.", "NTA because you are trying to make up for her dad being gone and letting her know that there is family that still remembers him. Also, what does the new dad do for your niece to make her feel welcome in the family? Obviously your former SIL is going out of her way for his daughter. Making her wait a year, when you know then, the excuse will be since we didn\u2019t go on a trip last year, we\u2019ll put off the new room and maybe do it next year. The excuse he doesn\u2019t have money because of his children seems to be just that, an excuse. He\u2019s got another child in the household. If something happens to you, will he still plan on not providing equally for the children. Is he trying to even step up emotionally to a fatherless child? It doesn\u2019t take money for that.", "Yta. Butting in like this will get your access to your niece revoked.", "YTA \n\nIt's not like they're neglecting her but it's not like she's the only one being excluded from the family trip because of the trip you took with her, it's just cancelled no one gets to go so no bias there \nSecondly they did say they would do her room next summer and she did get to go on a trip so it seems fair that since your niece got to something exciting then kay gets something exciting too.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, nobody is entitled to a vacation, especially one they are not paying for on their own. If Nancy has decided that the extra money is going towards home improvements rather than vacations this year, that is HER right as the parent. \n\nSecond, Emma is not being singled out. NOBODY is going on vacation. And her room will be redecorated too, next summer. Emma is also the ONLY one who went on a trip this year. So, how is this at all unfair to her unless it is also unfair to the whole family?", "NTA\n\nNancy is showing favoritism. I hope the marriage last, because if they get a divorce. Step-daughter will go with dad, and Nancy bio daughter the one who\u2019s staying", "YTA actually when I read this I thought \u201cfair enough\u201d. Emma got the vacation of a life time and Kay gets a bedroom makeover. Now that I write that out, I think you\u2019re the one who\u2019s being unfair", "YTA.  You have no right to tell your former SIL and her new husband how to handle their finances and where to spend their money. If you\u2019re upset that Emma has to wait a year for her room to be redone, then pay for her to do it now, and then the family can take their trip next year instead of skipping again to do her room.", "NTA but you have to understand Nancy\u2019s POV and can\u2019t blame her. She\u2019s trying to please two kids equally and one of them is her step kid. You\u2019re not wrong for sharing your opinion or POV and Nancy definitely shouldn\u2019t put the blame of her room makeover on her trip to Japan unless she\u2019s covering some of the cost. Wasn\u2019t mentioned so I added that part in and I\u2019m making an assumption.\n\nShe\u2019s doing her best as both a mom, wife and step mom. If that\u2019s the way she wants to run the house then she has that right. I don\u2019t think anyone is TA in this situation. Emma should be grateful she gets a once in a lifetime experience and we will see if her room gets the makeover next year or if Nancy comes up with some other excuse. Then we will really know her true colors.", "YTA they're not being unfair or favoring the other child. You are spoiling Emma, which is your right as a aunt, but acknowledge that your doing it. Most kids don't get a 2 week trip to Japan, that was an extreme luxury. \n\nAsk yourself something, do you ever do anything for Kay? Does Kay's fathers side of the family do things for Emma? Which child gets the most experiences and is it truly fair to begin with?", "YTA. Your niece got a two-week trip to Japan and is now crying that she doesn't get a family trip and has to wait till next year to get her room redecorated because you former SIL and her husband are doing something nice for her step sis who doesn't get all the things your niece does (music lessons, language lessons, trips to Japan). You do realize you have just made your niece sound like a bratty evil little stepsister, right?", "Im going to get an angry mob for this but NTA Op, your SIL is ruining her relationship with her daughter to appease her new man and his children. Its not fair that your niece has to grow up without her father and the play second fiddle to her mothers new family. You have every right to be mad and hopefully your SIL sees the mistake she is making before its to late and her daughter resents her.\n\nThe bond between children and parents is very delicate, and some parents either don't care and are oblivious to the consequences their actions have with the relationships they have with their children.\n\nI hope everything gets better and life gets better for your niece. No child should be in a situation where their own parent basically makes the lesser than the new family. You keep doing the good things and your niece will love you for having her back and being there for her.\n\nEdit: i guess a lot of y'all didn't read the snide comment the SIL made to the OP, she is obviously not meeting the needs of her daughter and putting her second.", " you took her on the trip because she did well in school and worked hard. What did step sister do for make over I think it really cancel out the hard work she did. \n\nAlthough we can all comment here you can\u2019t really say what they spend their money on. So for this alone I would said YTA but I think mum is also TA", "YTA. \n\nThe trip you\u2019re taking her on is kind of irrelevant. Most middle class American families need to make decisions and prioritize between trips and home renovations. It sounds perfectly fair to me to renovate one daughter\u2019s room this year, and the other\u2019s the next. \n\nThe fact that you\u2019re taking Emma on a trip just means it makes even more sense for renovations to be a higher priority than a vacation.", "YTA, your former SIL is right. She got a fancy trip overseas already she doesnt need to cry about not going on another one.", "NTA", "YTA. Your sister is not angry with you for taking your Niece on an amazing trip. She has not pushed you to treat both girls the same. \n\nYour sister is trying to make the excluded girl (Kay) feel special too. Your sister wants household peace, and sometimes that involves compromise. Your sister is not excluding Emma at all. She did not plan a trip for just her, her husband, and Kay. The trip is postponed for them all. Emma is getting something next year from her mother. 14 is old enough to understand give and take, and balance in relationships. Right now it is Kay\u2019s turn to be in the focus. Emma has had her turn. \n\nCrying unfair to Emma is entitled on your behalf. If you keep butting in, I can just bet that your sister will rescind your access to your niece to ensure her house is peaceful. Your feelings do not matter here.", "YTA\n\nIts not like they're going somewhere and leaving your niece. No one is going. Her step sister is getting her room redone. Your niece had a great two weeks in Japan. \n\nLet it go.", "NAH, although you're close. Nancy is right. Kay probably felt like shit, and this is a nice little bonus. If you're worried about creating resentment, this is definitely fertile soil for for that. Try explaining to Emma that it's not about 'fairness,' but rather equity. \n\nThat said, you're an amazing aunt. Emma is very likely to have you!", "YTA because you have overstepped. You don't get to decide how they use their money.", "NTA why couldn\u2019t they redo both rooms this year if the money they saved was from a vacation they wouldn\u2019t go on. That should have been enough for both girls, it seems to me that Emma\u2019s mom is favoring her stepdaughter. Kay ahs both parents and emma\u2019s mom where it seems Emma only has OP.", "YTA. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. And they\u2019ll do her room next year. They\u2019re not excluding her from a trip, they\u2019re just not taking one.", "YTA. You as the aunt have no right backseat parents the girls.  That's their mother's job.  Your niece's mother was generous enough to allow you to take her minor child with you outside the US.  Instead of appreciation that she is supporting your relationship with your, niece you are trying to insert yourself into her parenting and financial decisions.  If you don't back off and butt out, she may be less supportive of your involvement with your niece.  Frankly, you might have already damaged that relationship.

Geez, there\u2019s so many entitled people on reddit.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t get it, it is OP\u2019s money and that is their niece.  OP is already cautious on how much they are spending on their niece as to not make Kay jealous. Not to mention, and I think people are forgetting, the trip was a business trip. OP had to opportunity to bring their niece along because of work and did so. PLUS THEY BROUGHT SOUVENIRS FOR THE FAMILY. They didn\u2019t have too, but they did. You guys make it seem like Emma was somehow flaunting her trip and gloating about it. It\u2019s obvious the rest of the family, including OP\u2019s SIL, are jealous of Emma\u2019s opportunities and that OP can afford them.\n\nAlso what makes you guys think they\u2019ll keep their word on redecorating Emma\u2019s room?

But instead she used Emma\u2019s trip to justify the order the rooms would be done in.  \n\nDoes former SIL plan on doing something special for Kay every time you OP do something for Emma?  \n\nSo OP if you take Emma in another trip does that mean Emma doesn\u2019t get her room redone or if the family was going to take a trip then Emma would be left home to keep things even?  \n\nOP I will make a suggestion if you have any assets that you have Emma as the beneficiary in case something happens to you, if you are creating a college fund for Emma or you are leaving anything to Emma in your will please consider making sure with your attorney those funds are protected as in your sister has no access to them.  I\u2019d also suggest any funds be held in trust for your niece until she is 21 with exceptions for possibly paying for Emma\u2019s education with the funds being paid directly to the school. \n\nMy concern is your former SIL if still married to her husband will decide to be fair anything left to Emma be split with Kay. She may even decide that Kay should get a bigger portion because after all Emma had the benefit of having a rich aunt.   At 21 Emma should be strong enough to refuse such a request.", "NAH I think y\u2019all should stop arguing about it before y\u2019all both look like AH to your niece or her step sister.

If your niece doesn\u2019t get her room redone that\u2019d be unfair but having to wait til next summer isn\u2019t bad for a family on a budget.

Nancy works but can\u2019t afford these lessons on her own. Her husband also works but he has to pay child support for Kay\u2019s half siblings (from the marriage prior to Kay\u2019s mother) so I don\u2019t expect much from him.\n\nI never really bought Emma expensive gifts as I know that will create resentment with Kay. For birthdays and Christmas I usually give books and school related stuff. Boring, I know, but Emma is studious and she loves them. However, this summer, as a reward for making the highest honor roll at her school, I decided to take Emma on a vacation with me to Japan. My work place sent me over there for some QC and then I took vacation time after. Emma stayed with me and my assistant took care of her when I was busy; it was a great two weeks. We returned home happy with plenty of souvenirs for Emma\u2019s family.\n\nA couple days ago Emma called me, upset. Every summer her family goes on a family trip together for a week or so. This summer, however, Nancy and her husband decided not to go and used the money set aside for the trip to redecorate Kay\u2019s room instead, claiming that Emma already has her getaway in Japan with me. Nancy told Emma they will do her room next summer.\n\nI called and told Nancy she wasn\u2019t being fair in how she treated Emma. Nancy told me that Kay wasn\u2019t lucky enough to have some rich aunt taking care of her needs so she was trying to even things out for Kay. I thought that reasoning was BS but Nancy said I was spoiling Emma. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
