It\u2019s obvious your father only cares about his own needs - his fantasy of walking his daughter down the aisle. Beyond that, he really doesn\u2019t care about you. Otherwise he would have asked about it instead of telling you, he wouldn\u2019t have spammed social media about it when he never got an answer from you and, when he found out he wasn\u2019t going to get to do it, he sent his minions to send you all sorts of nasty messages. \n\nDon\u2019t feel a minute of guilt over this. Your father only cares about himself and would go back to ignoring you once he got what he wanted.", "No. Put him in the rearview. You said the right thing and for all those people DMing, make a canned message that says: my father had an affair and I was the product. He abandoned me and went no contact when I was X age. He simply evaporated and didn't even pay child support. So now he hears I'm getting married and decides he deserves to walk me down the aisle when I have seen or spoken to him in X years. So you can take your name calling and point it at the deadbeat dad where it belongs, or maybe you think that abandoned children should be grateful when their deadbeat fathers show up wanting to act like father's of the year. In which case, you are a repulsive person. And then block them all. NTA", "NTA- tell him if he gives your mom all the years of back child support and pays your uncle back for your education you\u2019ll invite him to the wedding", "NTA. Only tradition says the father walks his daughter, it's not a requirement. It's his sense of entitlement talking thinking this could fix years of neglect.", "NTA tell your dad and his family to fuck off. Walk proudly down the aisle with your uncle as you prepare for your new life.", "NTA and no reasonable person would suggest that you are. That man has clearly never been a father to you in any way that actually matters. He's your father by blood and nothing more. It takes more than being a sperm donor to be a dad. Cutting contact with you in the first place was bad enough, and now he's reinserted himself into your life (did he even apologize? Not that you have to forgive him. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do, but it doesn't even sound like he accepted responsibility for abandoning you and being such a terrible \"father\" in the first place) and thinks he's entitled to *walk you down the aisle*. The audacity of this guy to make a social media post announcing that he's going to walk you down the aisle (and framing it like he's doing you a favor) before even getting your permission. He's a selfish AH, and everyone trying to shame you is as bad as he is. I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this.\n\nEDIT: I MEANT NTA. That was a bad typo.", "YWNBTA - First, big congrats on the marriage. For your post, I think you have every right to choose who walks you down the aisle; especially in this situation where there is clear actions by the man who stepped up to be your father.\n\nSocial media can be tricky, but I wouldn\u2019t say you were completely in the wrong commenting what you did. At least one of you was being truthful.\nHope this didn\u2019t cause too much issues beyond receiving nasty messages from your dads side of the family.", "NTA. your dad is gonna walk you down the aisle, the man that have been by your side your entire life. End of discussion.", "Nah fam, you're not the asshole. Your uncle was there for you when daddy dearest dipped out so he gets first dibs on walking you down that aisle. And wtf is up with your dad tagging you without even getting a solid answer? Dude needs to get his priorities straight smh \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. \n\nDon't relent. Let your uncle walk you down the aisle because he doesn't get to be a good social media father after being negligent and inconsistent. If he is in a bad mood, that is on him. He walked out. He cut contact. Now he wants to play father. \n\nThen it is just a play for him.\n\nI really hate people like him.", "Your NTA. While I\u2019m not sure why my bio father dipped out of my life, I\u2019d of absolutely lost it on him if he had turned up at my wedding expecting to walk me down the aisle. Honestly you\u2019re better than me not losing your temper in the coffee shop but you should have told him there that missing half of your life disqualified him from that honor. Congratulations on your marriage \ud83d\udc95", "Ur not a asshole. U don't owe ur dad shit after he dipped out on u for 14 years. Just cuz ur related by blood doesn't mean he gets to walk u down the aisle. Uncle was there when it mattered, end of story. Don't let them guilt trip u into feeling bad about it either, that's some manipulative bullshit they're trying to pull. Stick with what feels right for u and fuck everyone else's opinion.", "NTA\n\nBlock him absolutely everywhere. How very dare he. I\u2019m furious for you, OP.\n\nI hope your uncle didn\u2019t see the post. And that if he did, he knows you well enough to know it wasn\u2019t true.", "NTA. Anyone who messages you should get a message like this before you block them. \n\n\u201cMy \u201cfather\u201d hasn\u2019t been in my life in any way since I was in middle school - that\u2019s at least a decade. And all by his choice. He made no attempt to be a parent to me. For that decade my only male role model was my uncle. He has put in the work to earn the right to walk me down the aisle. This man does not get to show up after so long, meet with me once, then make a Facebook post proclaiming he\u2019s walking me down the aisle. He can pretend to be a father all he wants. He has done nothing to earn that privilege. The fact I have his genes means nothing when he abandoned me. You can choose to support him or not but you\u2019re being blocked for harassing me. And he will not be walking me down the aisle in any circumstance, regardless of what lies he spews\u201d.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
