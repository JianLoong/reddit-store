Identity theft is a big thing here, and banks are insured for stuff like this. \n\nRegarding speaking to your mom, I think a lot depends on what she spent the money on (like if she gambled it all away, does she still have a gambling problem or has she gotten help?), and how you feel in your heart.", "NTA.

Your mom stole from you, ruined your credit and took away your dream. Hard to get past something like that but you didn\u2019t try to think of solutions, you just went into self destruction mode.
