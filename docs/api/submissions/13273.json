I do too but up until recently, for personal reasons that I\u2019m not comfortable talking about, I couldn\u2019t travel internationally. Nevertheless, throughout our relationship she has gone on vacation to other countries by herself or with a friend multiple times. It hurt every time that I couldn\u2019t go with her and I would express my desire for her to not go, and instead we could go somewhere stateside together, but traveling was so important to her that she booked the trips and went anyway. In her words, going somewhere in the US was lame. Eventually I accepted that it was wrong of me to try to keep her from going just because I couldn\u2019t and I supported her going on the trips, although it still always hurt. I was able to support it in part because she always told me she would love nothing more than for me to join her on the trips and that when I was able to, we would always go together. \n\nFast forward to now. I\u2019m finally able to go on international trips with her and indeed, I\u2019ve been planning a trip with her all year to Europe. We\u2019ve talked about it and have been looking forward to it immensely. She had to go out of town to a work conference for 6 days and while I wasn\u2019t happy about being the lone parent with my 2 year old, I know it was for work so it couldn\u2019t be helped. Right before she left she told me that her friend in Wales had offered to her that if she came out she would show her the sights and be her guide so to speak. She then asked me to think about her going on a solo trip over there in May. I told I would think about it. \n\nThe week she was away at the work conference was absolutely exhausting. I spent all but 60 minutes of my day either taking care of my daughter or at work and after the 6 days I really didn\u2019t want to do it again for 10-14 days while she went on another trip. When she got home I told her \u201cI don\u2019t think we can do that Wales trip this year, but her friend isn\u2019t going anywhere so maybe we can do it in the next couple years when our daughter is a little older and easier to handle solo\u201d. She got upset and we got into an argument over it. \n\nI felt like all those years and times that she had told me she wanted to travel with me and that we would travel together as soon as we could were a lie. She claimed by not letting her go that I was being controlling ( and she has a history of making her mind up on something, and if I don\u2019t agree she thinks I\u2019m being controlling). I was frustrated and angry and hurt so I told her \u201cFine. You go on your trip to Wales, and I\u2019ll go on a trip to Europe by myself.\u201d  \n\nThis really pissed her off and now we\u2019re both angry at each other and I need to know, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1679865925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12307om/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_if_she_wants_to_go/", "score": 489, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(It's a big country, I'm sure there are many parts of it that aren't \"lame\".)\n\nNow you can finally travel together, she still wants to go on solo trips while you take care of your toddler.\n\nYou definitely deserve YOUR solo trip.\n\nAnd use your trip to rethink the dynamics of your marriage....\n\nNTA", "NTA just because of the childcare.  It isn't fair of her to expect you to be a solo parent for that long if it's not necessary.  you guys should be having a family holiday. And you're not being controlling.  You're expressing an opinion and trying to work out a solution to a problem, which is perfectly OK.", "NTA. I'm sorry to say, but I feel like your wife is a really, really selfish kind of person.", "INFO - has the travel ban been for the whole duration of the relationship 9+ years? If so it's not fair to try and prevent her seeing the world for that long and to guilt her for wanting to, because you seem to acknowledge that's a really big thing for her. I'm sure America has a lot to offer, but the world is has so much more to see, and life is short. On the other hand, she seems quite selfish anyway, doesn't seem to care how hard it is on you. \n\nBut then it really sounds like you're both communicating poorly. You didn't say anything about the pretty obvious compromise of both of you going to Wales, or including it in your trip if you wanted to visit more places. Wales voted to leave the European Union, but they're still very much in Europe and is well connected. If you did actually suggest that and there's some weird reason only she can stay with her friend, and you're not able to get other accommodation together, honestly I'd be starting to be a little bit suspicious..\n\nCurrent fight - ESH. You basically admit that you didn't actually want to go to Europe alone, but were just saying it when angry and frustrated, to hurt her back. Obviously she hurt you and is being selfish, but that's not a good response. \n\nMore INFO - Has she ever had to mind the kid for even maybe 2 days by herself? This could be a really big issue that she might just not appreciate how difficult it is.\n\nAnyway, healthy conversation should help a lot, cut out the mean things like name calling (controlling etc.) and cut out making silly hurtful threats that you don't actually want to do, and with a bit of luck you'll start to find compromises instead of just fighting.", "NTA. Taking trips alone when you have kids and the other person is going to be left behind with all the parental responsibilities is something that MUST be discussed and agreed upon ahead of time. \n\nThe fact that she took all these trips without you not because you didn\u2019t want to go but because you *couldnt* go seems so awful to me. Why would you do that to someone you love?? It\u2019s so selfish and cruel. She couldn\u2019t compromise even part of the time and travel somewhere together?", "INFO\n\nHow often has she left you alone with your daughter for traveling?", "NTA.\n\nYour wife sounds pretty self centered for this particular trip.  At this point in the marriage with a kid, it's supposed to be a partnership.", "Info: Feels like there is something missing here. \n\nYou seem like you might have wanted to travel previously but couldn't. Surely if it was something medical then your wife should have done stuff in country or locally with you. So her travelling all the time would make you N T A.\n\nHowever if it was a legal reason for not being able to travel then it might change the verdict and become an E S H or even Y T A depending on the circumstances that caused it.\n\nEither way your situation has now changed and there is a new dynamic that you and your wife need to discuss more to make sure you understand what it is you both want.", "Nta. Controlling, she\u2019s and ass. It\u2019s not controlling to say hey it\u2019s not a good time because \u2026. Let\u2019s rethink for another time in the future. That\u2019s compromising in a marriage. She\u2019s selfish and manipulative.", "YTA. Sorry to be blunt, but you\u2019ve posted previously that you don\u2019t have any friends and have a dead bedroom, so my impression is that you\u2019re placing all of your social need, expectations and insecurities on your wife and that you very likely have been the AH here, as part of a pattern of being controlling.\n\nI don\u2019t get the impression you\u2019ve given as unbiased an account as you could\u2019ve, and your post lacks any empathy for your wife or consideration of her feelings, thoughts and perspective (it doesn\u2019t even say anything positive about her). You talk about how wilful she is, but my read is that you were being controlling and negative about her plans, possibly always trying to plead with her to cancel them, and that she was putting her foot down to stop those conversations.\n\nYour wife wanted to go on a solo trip to see her friend, and in return you weaponise the Europe trip that had been planned to be a joint experience? That\u2019s ridiculous and not comparable. \n\nWhile I\u2019m unsure about how the current parenting divide works (the way you\u2019ve worded the section about her work trip seems iffy to me as if she really should be at home parenting) it sounds like your wife may not have been able to engage in her hobby over the past 2 years. If that\u2019s the case she deserves some time to engage in her hobbies too, and with the support of her partner. If the conversation went how you said I agree she overreacted, but I too would be upset if I hadn\u2019t been able to engage in something important to me for some time, particularly if she saw your response as a negative and controlling behaviour re-emerging. \n\nI\u2019m not convinced that you genuinely ever got on board with your wife travelling alone and weren\u2019t holding these trips against her (I\u2019d guess this was born out of insecurity that gave rise to you being controlling). You feel it\u2019s relevant she\u2019d said that you\u2019d *always* go on trips together (seems a bit much) but you\u2019ve suggested delaying the trip to Wales so a solo parent can more easily handle your child. However, you\u2019re not discussing care arrangements or support for during the trip to enable her to go.
