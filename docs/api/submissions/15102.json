We figured its much cheaper for both of us this way. I work in a very well payed job that allows me to work remote. So i'm at home most of the time. My brother also works from home as he is a freelancer. Last year he got together with his now girlfriend Jane. The way he got with her is a bit weird but i played along. He told her that he makes a lot of money to try to impress her. He told me that he thinks his money is the sole reason she's with him. She claims that she truly loves him but i'm not buying this.\n\nShe always expected him to buy her new stuff or take her out for dinner. And here's where it gets a bit tricky. My brother lied about the money he is having. In fact he only makes about 20% of my income. Which is no problem to me as I'm perfectly fine with paying every bill for as long as it takes for him to make more money. But this also means that he asks me for money when it comes to his girlfriends demands and wanting to be a good brother I always helped him out.\n\nBut recently Jane is complaining about me. Apparently my brother told her that I was unemployed and that I was living off his money. I could have exposed him right then and there but I decided to play along and pretended that I was poor so that he could look better for her. He thanked me for playing along and apologized to me. He said that he truly loved her and doesn't want to lose her. I told him she was taking advantage of him but he wouldn't listen.\n\nOne time she shouted at me that I should do all the chores since I'm \"not working at all\" and my brother supported her. I looked at him with an angry glare and he set up this pleading face again. And again I played along now not only making all of the money but now doing all of the chores. I really played along for a long time but when she started talking bullshit about me while we were eating I had enough.\n\nI told her to look at his bank account and to look if he ever payed one of the bills. She was confused and his facial expression went blank. She asked what I was talking about and I showed her the money I was making and the bills I was paying. I also showed her that everything he bought her actually came from my pocket. She looked at him angrily and stormed off. She didn't return until the evening where they had a huge fight. At this point I didn't care anymore.\n\nAfter that she left again and my brother started to argue with me about how I \"ruined his relationship\" and that I was an awful brother and that I was a huge asshole. I told him I wouldn't have done it if he stood up for me earlier. I later got a call from my mom telling me a similiar thing telling me I should've just played along for my brother sake. So he even called her. Btw. his girlfriend sent me an apology on WhatsApp afterwards.\n\nSo AITA for exposing my brother like this?", "created_utc": 1681803827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qf401/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_girlfriend_the_truth/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course I could be wrong and my brother hasn't told me everything. But I saw many of her traits myself.

The brother was building a \"relationship\" with someone he \"loved\" but it was all based on lie upon lie upon lie.
