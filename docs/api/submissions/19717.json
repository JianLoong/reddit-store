I spent a lot of time decorating and making it look spooky. I turned all the lights off so only fake candles and orange lights could be seen around the house. There was also Halloween music playing loudly. Long story short, Sam for some reason decided to bring her poor dog with her to the party. Upon entering, the dog was immediately terrified and had explosive diarrhea in the main entry way/living room. It was dark and hard to see, but everyone in the area could smell it. I didn\u2019t realize it, but Sam was also covered in diarrhea because she was holding the dog. I started to try to clean it up but I couldn\u2019t see exactly where it happened because the room was dark. Someone took the dog outside and I found Sam crying to her partner in the kitchen. I was a bit panicked because there was diarrhea in the main area where everyone was coming in/walking around. I interrupted the conversation and said \u201csorry, where did the dog have diarrhea?? Can you show me where??\u201d And they both seemed visibly irritated with me. \n\nShe ended up leaving right away with her dog and partner and a few people helped me clean it up. The diarrhea was seriously everywhere - walls, floor, carpet, on our shoes, etc. My roommates think I was a jerk for not being sympathetic and appearing visibly irritated while cleaning up the diarrhea. I noticed that Sam has since unfriended me on all social media, and never apologized for the situation. Sam still hangs out with my roommates but doesn\u2019t interact with me.

Sam is a (pardon the pun) shitty dog owner and a shitty friend. She treated her dog like a cute accessory instead of a living creature with needs and concerns of it's own, and then instead of taking responsibility, decided to leave the poo-splosion for you to deal with while she moaned to her partner (and spread feces further around in the party). Good riddance to her.", "NTA. Fing gross. I would \"bill' the friend for clean up. Embarrassed be damned. Clean up after your damn dog!!", "NTA... Sam was cruel to bring her dog to a party.

She saved the dog from being further abused, killed (or my guess eaten) and was probably trying what she thought best to help her dog live a normal life. Unfortunately she got a big reality check.\n\nIf she was crying, I\u2019m sure she was mortified. Did you ever ask if she or the dog were ok? It\u2019s possible she felt a lack of empathy from you in the moment. But it\u2019s pointless to speculate why she avoids you. If it\u2019s really bothering you, reach out and communicate.

Their dog their responsibility.\n\nI would actually send them a cleaning bill\n\n\nNTA", "Small price to pay to never have to deal with her (or her dog) again. \n\nYou don\u2019t just bring a dog to a private residence without asking. You certainly clean up their messes. \n\nNTA", "It's nice when trash is insecure enough to take itself out.", "I am a dog person but i wouldn't bring my dog anywhere he is not invited. Anyone being a dog person doesn't entitle them to bring their dog everywhere without considering other people and in this case when Sam knew that her dog has anxiety how the f did she think her dog would just sit in a corner and enjoy the party.", "Entitled dog moms are the worst. One of my friends is terrified of dogs and this lady we both knew insisted on bringing her dog to a Halloween event we were both going to. \n\nMy friend made the high crime of commenting on a Facebook post about the party that she didn't come because of her fear of the dog. My crime was agreeing with her, because I didn't have enough spoons that day to deal with a strange dog. Neither comment was trashing the dog or the owner, just saying we preferred to stay away until the dog was gone. \n\nDog mom was FURIOUS and went on a Twitter rant about how her dog was being slandered by us and how dare we not spend time with her dog. It was ridiculous."]}
