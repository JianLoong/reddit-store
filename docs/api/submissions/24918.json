{"id": 24918, "submission_id": "15uf5s6", "title": "AITA for saying I'd cover up my tattoo if my coworker (who made the complaint) covers theirs up too?", "selftext": "Back when I was into cosplay, I got a tattoo of the Dark Mark.  I was (and still am) a huge Harry Potter fan.  At the time, I figured it would be easier to get a tattoo done instead of having to redraw it or mess with temporary tattoos every time I wanted to cosplay as Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nSince then I've gotten many, more tattoos.  People tend to notice the Dark Mark more than the rest.  \n\nI volunteer at an animal shelter.  It's been hot, so I've been wearing short sleeve and sleeveless tops to work.  There's no rule saying that I can't.  However, I had a coworker, Tori, pull me aside and told me that I had to a long-sleeved shirt or cover up my tattoos if we have to work together.\n\nWe live in New Mexico, which is hotter than Satan's sauna right now.  \n\nI told them no because I want to feel cool and comfortable.  Then I asked why.\n\nTori said its because they don't feel comfortable working with someone who shows off a hate symbol (my Dark Mark tattoo) on my arm on the daily.  I told them I'd consider it on condition that they cover up their own tattoo.  Tori has a prominent Empire tattoo on their arm.  \n\nI'm no Star Wars fan, but I come from a family who are.  From what I understand, the Empire committed just as many war crimes if not more than Voldemort and crew.  At least Voldemort didn't order a planet to be destroyed.  \n\nPersonally, I am proud of myself for telling Tori off like that.  I think they're really hypocritical, narcissistic, and an unpleasant person to deal with in general.  But when I brought up the story over drinks with some other volunteers later, they didn't agree.  Mostly that my tattoo has more serious implications than Tori's.  And apparently Tori has been looking to get that Empire tattoo removed or covered up as they've come to seriously regret it.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "created_utc": 1692349341, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uf5s6/aita_for_saying_id_cover_up_my_tattoo_if_my/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
