My father said he would be home like half an hour before the show would start, so I finished making dinner at that time.

Life would be very dull if we were all the same. But the minute a person's eccentricities start negatively impacting on other people, they cross a line.\n\nYour father's weird dining preference is affecting your comfort, and he throws a toddler tantrum when you refuse to indulge him.

He clearly told y\u2019all to start eating without him, so anything after that was entirely on him.

Get out of there at fast as you can.", "I think this has nothing to do with food. This is his problem and food was the excuse he used to blow up.

Not sur what culture he grew up in but he might have to be a bit mor open to new things or he might starve if you and your sister move out one day.

Dad is totally the a-hole here, and to a lesser extent your mother and sister for putting up with this.  Maybe some of this is cultural around food and eating habits, and maybe some of your mother tolerating it is financially-driven, but that is the biggest, whiniest toddler-tantrum I have heard in a long time.  You have to dance attendance on him while he eats?!  Horse pucky!  He's a grown up, even though he's not acting like one.  You cooked for them all, for heaven's sake, and he was an hour late.  If you hadn't been watching something it would have been marginally more understandable if he had \\*asked for\\* as opposed to \\*demanded\\* some company.", "NTA. Your dad is an adult.

You would think he\u2019d be able to behave like an adult, but apparently not.", "NTA your dad is a weirdo and instead of being thankful that you made dinner, he made you feel bad for not staying in the same room with him. It\u2019s not normal to require that someone holds your hand before you\u2019ll eat. Your mother and sister were also wrong to scream at you,", "NTA \n\nHonestly I would go to the extreme and stare with huge wide eyes at my dad as I ate dinner extremely slowly and get upset if he finished first and wanted to leave the table and have a fit that he wanted me to starve\u2026\u2026", "You didn't make him mad and you didn't make him leave.

The mother and gets 2/5 for siding with the asshole and screaming at you. I'm sorry op, you need to start looking for your own place to live at this point. It doesn't seem safe for you to live there", "NTA \n\nIf he needs someone to sit with him in order to eat then he probably also could use some therapy", "NTA    Way for everybody to overreact!

You're just the scapegoat! NTA. The argument, or his issues, do not warrant him staying out all night.", "Eccentric is a generous word for narcissistic, controlling behaviour and emotional blackmail. NTA.", "Came here to say this", "Yes. I am being generous about his weird behavior.\n\nI merely wanted to make a clear distinction between the weirdness itself and its effects on other people.\n\nThe opprobrium he deserves is not because of his weird habit per se, but because he demands everyone indulge it, no matter how much inconvenience or distress it causes them."]}
