When they signed you over to your dad they lost ANY claim they can possibly make to acting as parents or being in your life if you don't want them to. Do not let them or any other family members guilt you into going. Yes to some your stated reasons reasons for not wanting to go, the surface may seem materialistic, they speak to the bigger issue of what their role in your life is....what they want OR what you want. Furthermore, even at the surface level, given circumstances, it is totally reasonable for you not to want to suffer any material inconvenience for their sakes. Stick to your guns and spend your summer where you want to doing with those you really want to spend time with. Good luck.", "NTA, it must be really hard for you right now. You are definitely not the AH though. Your bio\u2019s gave you up, and you have been raised by your dad ever since. It\u2019s completely unfair for them to now demand you come back, 16 years later. They lost that privilege when they gave you up. You have a loving dad now, and you don\u2019t ow them anything. \n\nNow, calling them out on their financial hardships as a reason to not live with them isn\u2019t fair. But I also don\u2019t think you would have mentioned it if they had accepted your first or second \u201cno\u201d. They didn\u2019t respect your decision and kept pressing and pressing. I don\u2019t blame you for snapping. Enjoy your summer with your dad, and just ignore them.", "NTA, that's a lot to take in, and I can see not wanting to share a small home with people you don't really know well. Can you stay for a couple of days - or even a day? If it's further, can you and your father stay nearby and visit? There should be other options. BTW  you should not have made that comment about them still being broke - I'm sure it was a difficult decision to give you up, and that was a pretty mean thing to say.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wow.. it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to spend time with them but the way you responded saying \u201cthey are still broke\u201d is Very \u201cAsshole\u201d behavior. So uncalled for..", "YTA.   \nThey are your bio parents, imagine the pain they had to go through realising they are too broke to raise you. All they want is for you to spend one summer with them, if you want to refuse that is your choice but don't be a dick about it. Your lucky to even get to live such a luxurious life. BE GRATEFUL", "YTA\n\nSounds like your adoptive dad raised you as a spoiled brat.", "YTA it\u2019s totally reasonable to not want to spend your summer with people you really don\u2019t know, but your reasoning is pretty shitty and your attitude towards them is even shittier", "YTA I shared a bathroom with 4 other people and room smaller than my bathroom with 2 siblings for 18 years and guess what, I didn't die. I understand you were spoiled by your rich dad, but judging people by their wealth or lack thereof  is not cool. They seem to genuinely want to get to know you, your brother is even sacrificing his personal space for you, you can suck it up for a month to see how it goes and if it's that bad  don't stay the rest of summer.", "YTA. Why not start with one overnight or a weekend, just to get to know them better. It was kind of crappy of your dad not to allow them to have a relationship with you but that\u2019s water under the bridge at this point. Your comments to them are totally, totally unacceptable. I understand you really don\u2019t know these people well but even strangers don\u2019t deserve to be spoken to the way you spoke to your bio parents. You should be ashamed of yourself, and your father should be ashamed of himself for not raising you better.", "Wow, you are very ungrateful and spoiled! Sharing a bathroom with 3 others is something you \u201ccan\u2019t do\u201d? You better get that mentality out of your system, it\u2019s perfectly normal to share a bathroom. Imagine this, in my country it\u2019s perfectly normal to have one family bathroom with toilet upstairs and a separate toilet downstairs. No matter how many people live in the house. I\u2019ve never lived in a house with an en suite. Better get over yourself, girl. YTA", "NTA. Could you have been nicer? Sure. But they also didn\u2019t accept your no right away. They seem to feel entitled to your time and affection. Frankly they are lucky you\u2019re willing to talk to them at all.", "yeah its really annoying when they try to act like my parents and they act like im a jerk for choosing my dad over them", "They could have respected OPs choice without hounding them.  \"No\" is a complete answer.", "I'm sure they are aware of their financial situation so it couldn't have been a surprise for them", "Blood and DNA do not make a parent. Those who put in the work to raise her are her real parents. She owes these people nothing. She has every right to not go see them.", "Why, because she doesn't want to spend her summer in poverty with people she doesn't even know?  That is ridiculous. She owes them nothing.", "spoiled brat? what because I don't want to spend my summer in a box?", "well they gave me up because they couldn't give me a good life now they can't be mad that I chose the same thing", "Wanting to get to know someone and guilt tripping her into staying for the whole summer are two different things. In my opinion they\u2019re asking too much from her, too fast. \n\nAlso, sharing a room with family you\u2019ve known your whole life is not the same as sharing space with people you barely know.", "I don't want to get to know them better. I already have a dad and soon a stepmom and I love them both. I don't need anymore parents", "ungrateful for what? they haven't done anything for me", "Even if they are aware it doesn\u2019t mean they want to be reminded of it. Their only crime was wanting to spend time with their kid. At least they tried giving you a better life. Maybe try showing a little gratitude instead of acting entitled?", "I never said she is obligated to go seem them. My point is don't be an ass to them abt being poor. Cuz she didn't earn a single buck of the money for the room she lives in. She should have been nice abt it.", "No because of the way she responded. It comes off as someone who is entitled and spoiled. No one is saying she has to spend time with them. She just could\u2019ve reacted better. What are you an alternate account of OP or something? Is that why you\u2019re defending her so much?", "No, because you were rude and cruel in what you said to your bio mom. Being poor isn't a crime. Asking a teenager to share a bathroom isn't a criminal offence, no matter what you might think. You did not have to treat another human being that way. You are absolutely entitled to spend your summer doing what you like, without seeing your bio family, but holding your boundaries doesn't mean you get to be cruel or hurtful while doing it. YTA.", "Its not because you don't want to spend the summer with them because you don't know them.  Its because you don't want to spend the summer with them because they are poor.  You come across as elitist.", "That is so true and also the reason why you are NTA", "Your bio parents wanted you to stay with them and you just think they\u2019re poor because they share a bathroom and don\u2019t have a third room for you to stay in. They were all willing to accommodate you, but you spit that in their faces, calling them poor. That is ungrateful.", "She is NOT their kid. They are only the source of her DNA. She doesn't know them, they didn't raise her. She has parents who did. She has every right to choose not to spend time with her sperm and egg donors.", "they could have tried to give me a better life themselves instead of choosing the easy way and just having someone else do their job", "the bio \"parents\" could show a little gratitude and stop acting entitled. they gave up their parental claims to her.", "To be fair, they said they just didn't want to spend the summer with them at first. It's only when they kept insisting that OP stays with them that they snapped. Respect boundaries and you won't get yelled at.", "Being a bio-parent counts for nothing if they have no roll in raising the child. She has no obligations to these people.", "oh so you would spend your summer with poor strangers just to be nice?", "Maybe consider that this attitude is what your dad regrets when he prevented you from knowing them", "Maybe consider that this attitude is what your dad regrets when he prevented you from knowing them", "Ah, I missed that vital part when I first read it. You're absolutely right.", "I don't care if you spend the summer with them or not.  Not staying with them because you don't want to is a perfectly valid reason.  \n\nYou are being judgemental about their financial position is just rude.  There was no need to do that to them and doubling down on it here is just compounding what people think of you. \n\nAfter reading your other comments I stand by my original statement your adoptive dad has raised a spoiled brat.", "They're her biological parents and they're poor and that's why OP doesn't care for them. They're better off not knowing her, she's such an entitled brat."]}
