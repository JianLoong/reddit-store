I should be excited, but this whole situation has caused me a lot of anxiety because I\u2019m 8 months pregnant and she isn\u2019t happy about it.\n\nYou see, Sarah and her fianc\u00e9 Dave got engaged two years ago and decided they\u2019d get married on their anniversary which is so sweet and very them. \n\nAs Sarah\u2019s MOH, I\u2019ve been helping her plan and navigate through all of the many complicated feelings that go with being a bride- especially with setting boundaries with family members who don\u2019t understand that this wedding is about Sarah and Dave and not them. \n\nOne of the major setbacks was the fact that they want to have a childless wedding. Because of Sarah\u2019s anxiety, I took up deescalate some of her family members that demanded to be \u201cthe exception\u201d and was able to help talk down all of the people who felt entitled to this wedding.\n\nAll was well with the world until I found out I was pregnant. My husband and I have been actively trying to have a baby for the past few years with no luck. I have some medical issues which make having children extremely challenging for me, and when I found out I thought Sarah would be happy for me but she told me I was incredibly selfish.\n\nShe did the math and figured out I\u2019d be due around the date of her wedding- which (she reminded me) I knew about well in advance. I tried to explain myself, but she wouldn\u2019t hear it. She said if I was really her friend, I would have planned around her wedding.\n\nI told her I realized she was hurt, but I wasn\u2019t about to put my plans on hold for her. She got even more upset. She didn\u2019t understand how I could spend all that time telling her loved ones not to bring children to her wedding only to turn around and do it myself.\n\nI was shocked. I\u2019m not due until the week after her wedding so technically wouldn\u2019t be bringing a baby to the wedding. She then expressed how she was concerned about me going into labor at her wedding and started crying. I assured her that wouldn\u2019t happen, and for the past couple of months she\u2019s been bringing this concern up to me repeatedly and making comments about my body changing and the pictures, etc.\nShe\u2019s mentioned more than once she\u2019s worried I\u2019ll be taking attention away from her and now I\u2019m starting to believe it.\n\nLast night some of the other brides maids went out drinking with Sarah and I guess my pregnancy came up again because I\u2019ve received quite a few texts and snaps telling me that I\u2019m a bad friend and don\u2019t deserve to be a part of this wedding. They\u2019ve even called me an AH for planning my pregnancy during the wedding.

Don\u2019t stress yourself out during what is supposed to be a happy time for you.", "NTA\n\nDump this 'friend'. She obviously cares more about herself than you.

When you have difficulty getting pregnant, there is no real 'planning'. you try, and try, and try some more or you'll never get pregnant. Gah I'm so mad about this. I'd get rid of the whole friend group.", "NTA. Does she seriously expect you to stop trying for a baby to accommodate her desire that you are not pregnant at her wedding? Wow she is selfish. It\u2019s not your responsibility to put your life on hold to please her. She sounds very immature and entitled. I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends with this woman if it were me. Congratulations on your baby!!", "NTA. How badly do you want this person in your life? Because if I were in your shoes, I\u2019d be having a quick conversation that went like, hey: \u201cfriendship is a two-way street. Your wedding is important. My pending baby is important.

Congratulations on your pregnancy! It's understandable that you're excited about this new chapter in your life, especially after trying for so long. Sarah's reaction to your pregnancy is completely unwarranted and frankly, quite selfish.\n\nIt's not fair for her to expect you to put your plans on hold for her wedding, especially since you're not due until after the wedding. Her concern about you going into labor at the wedding seems like an irrational fear that's more about her being the center of attention rather than genuine concern for your well-being.\n\nFurthermore, her reaction to your pregnancy seems hypocritical considering how she wanted a childless wedding and expected her loved ones to respect that boundary. It's not fair for her to demand that you adhere to a standard that she herself wasn't willing to follow.\n\nThe fact that her other bridesmaids are ganging up on you and calling you names is also not okay. It's important to remember that your worth as a friend is not determined by your ability to conform to someone else's expectations.\n\nIn summary, Sarah is being unreasonable and selfish, and you should not feel guilty for planning your pregnancy according to your own timeline. Your priority right now should be taking care of yourself and your growing family, and if Sarah can't understand that, then perhaps she's not as good a friend as you thought.", "NTA.

You realize n9ce normal people are not like this?", "NTA\n\nThere is a selfish person in this story, but it definitely isn't you. \n\nIt has become pretty clear at this point that Sarah is no longer your friend. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that she has become your bully, so what I would do is pull out of the wedding and cut her off entirely. Friends don't treat each other like this and you don't deserve to be dealing with her bullshit at *any* point in your life - much less when you're about to give birth.", "NTA\n\nIt is the most incredible moment for you, being the first time mum. True friends should be happy with you. Your friend sounds extremely selfish even accusing you of being self-centered. \n\nPeople are planning wedding way ahead any it is an asshole move to expect that anyone involved in the wedding preparation would put his life on hold for them. Not for two (!) years! \n\nI am also expecting right now and I can\u2019t event imagine that anyone from my surroundings would be mad at me for being pregnant. And vice versa. Two weeks ago my SIL announce t that she\u2019s also pregnant, with her 3rd. Am I accusing her for stealing an attention from me and my pregnancy? Of course NO! I am happy with her \n\nI wish you better friends. This was a big test and they didn\u2019t pass it. I\u2019m sorry that it happened to you.", "Nta congratulations on ur pregnancy", "NTA She sounds like bridezilla! If she's your friend she knows how difficult it has been for you to conceive. She doesn't sound like she cares at all about your pregnancy or your baby other than how it will ruin her pictures and possibly draw attention away from her. If it were me, I'd drop out of the wedding all together with the way any of them are treating you. They sound juvenile.", "Nta and she really isn't your friend. That's an awful thing to demand from someone.", "NTA and frankly, she\u2019s not really your friend if she thinks you got pregnant *at* her.", "NTA. This is the craziest thing that I've read recently. If and when you have a child is up to you, the father and nature. Nobody else. This is self-centeredness and entitlement level infinite from your so-called friend (that very clearly isn't one at all). She's a major AH.", "Why are you still in this person's life, much less her wedding? She's not your friend anymore. You have ceased to be a person to her and are just a cog in the wedding machine. Bow out of the wedding, decide if you even want to attend, and focus on your own family. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I can't believe how petty some of these AITA queries can be. Obviously, if you've had trouble getting pregnant, you couldn't \"plan\" when it was going to happen. And, frankly, why is it even an issue? Who cares?\n\nYeah, your \"friend\" does. Her reaction is very weird and unpleasant. But maybe you should consider yourself lucky you've found out how awful she is. I'd distance myself from her.", "NTA\n\nYou do not put your life on hold for someone else's wedding!! Especially when you've had difficulties getting pregnant. Sarah sounds like one of those people who'll be upset if you give birth in the week after her wedding as it'll mean the world isn't revolving around her anymore, and you've stolen the spotlight, or some other BS.\n\nDoes she seriously think you're bringing a child to the wedding by being pregnant? That's how it reads, though perhaps I misunderstood.\n\nHonestly, you don't need the stress right now. I imagine you'd feel bad if you didn't go, but you need to do what's right for you - do whatever makes you feel least bad. Sarah has shown her true colours.", "NTA, life happens and you can\u2019t put a pause for two years on family planning. \n\nHowever, you need to seriously consider the idea you won\u2019t be able to attend this wedding.

It did not even came into my mind that I could be mad at them. Of course you are happy for your friends to have a baby! That's more important than a wedding.

There's no commitment bigger and more joyous than having a baby, especially when it's difficult and you're not sure it will happen. If this major life event isn't inspiring her to express happiness for you, adding more happiness to her wedding happiness, I question her actual friendship for you. \n\nA wedding used to be a community celebration of the couple's commitment and a chance to witness and share in their joy. Now it's a whole other set of things, none of which have to do with sharing happiness, for way too many people. You don't have to feed this beast. I'd dip right out.

It's her wedding granted but a friend wouldn't want you to put your life on hold for them.

I understand your friend's disappointment with some of those things as an initial reaction to how this will affect her big day, but she should have come to an acceptance by now, and a genuine happiness for her maid of honor, especially since it's been difficult for you to conceive, etc. You did nothing wrong and you don't deserve what she is doing, same with what her friends are doing. I'm not sure you should even have to stay the maid of honor after this. You've done so much.

Again congratulations!!", "NTA and I\u2019d let someone else be her maid of honor and bow out of attending the wedding. Clearly your friendship doesn\u2019t mean much to her.

You are making me feel ashamed of my pregnancy when I should be enjoying it.*\n\n*I hope you have a wonderful wedding, but because of your treatment of me and making me feel ashamed of something I should be overjoyed about, I have decided to not only step down as MOH, but step back from our friendship.

Hope the dress had pockets though!", "NTA. Your so called friend is being selfish and unrealistic. Life doesn\u2019t stop because someone is getting married and it\u2019s ridiculous for her to expect otherwise. The only thing you could have done differently is you should have immediately stepped down as MOH when you learned your due date was so close to her wedding date. Babies rarely come on time so the possibility that you wouldn\u2019t be able to attend her wedding was very high. At the same time your friend should have just asked you to step down instead of trashing you like this.", "NTA. You need to cut ties with her", "NTA, Obviously, you rubbed your hands like a bad guy and evilly snickered at ruining your friends wedding /s.  Your life is obviously not all about her.\n\nI must note that all due dates are approximate. My kids were 1.5 weeks to 2 weeks late, and someone else was lucky to make it to 3 weeks early. Even some scheduled c sections and inductions had to be done early for the baby's safety. You might not make it to be a MOH, even if you still wanted to be one. \n\nIf you wish to keep the friendship in any way, offer to drop out and just be a guest.

If you have fertility issues, then you REALLY couldn't have planned this.\n\nTell your friend that if she's that worried about her big day, then you won't come. Problem solved. Then don't talk to her anymore, cause that's not cool at all.

The only mention of it came up was making sure I had shade (summer outdoor wedding) and a joke that the only reason my sister's last attendant wasn't pregnant was he was gay and child free.

It definitely didn\u2019t detract focus from my friend and her husband though.

After she left the bride tells me \"I don';t get why she just can't wait until after the wedding to try for another baby.\" and I explain that her having a wedding does not give her any authority over anyone else's life, body, or plans. Had the MOH actually waited she would have waited a year because the wedding was rescheduled in the end. That MOH has no idea that conversation even happened.\n\nYour friend doesn't even deserve an invite to your baby shower or to even meet the baby or be in its life for that matter. What it also sounds like is she may be comparing her milestone with yours. That maybe she's ONLY getting married while you already did that AND onto the next milestone before her. Like I said to that bride, she doesn't own your plans or your body and to even suggest that and being so blinded by the fact that it's such an accomplishment to even get pregnant these days to begin with.

Should you also avoid trying to get pregnant nine months before the holidays in case people want childfree get-togethers, or plan to avoid important work events or the birthdays of your family members?

That doesn't feel fair to me - if she wanted you as her MoH then you must have a pretty good relationship. But it sounds to me like maybe the stress of this wedding is getting to her, and she's got tunnel vision and can't see past the wedding logistics to see the damage she's doing to her relationship with you. It would probably be a kindness if you could sit down with her, acknowledge that the timing isn't perfect but it is what it is, and sincerely ask what she wants you to do now.

Like, I'm sure you're not going to try and upstage her at her own wedding, and if anyone gushes an uncomfortable amount over you, you'd remind them that it's Sarah's day, not yours - maybe it would help Sarah if you told her that?\n\nAnyway you're NTA here, but I think there's a good chance that Sarah isn't the AH either.", "What?

Her first reaction to the news definitely should not have been to \"do the math\" and make it about herself immediately! When my husband and I were ready to TTC, I wanted the baby so bad that I pulled my IUD out myself rather than wait 3 months to see my gyno. Nothing was more important than *our* family.

It even got worse after we graduated high school. She got married right after at age of 17 (in our country you usually graduate HS in the year you turn 18 and she was born late in the year). After a while, her lifestyle and ideas and concerns about her family home were more valuable then whatever any of us went true. Eventually, she started to twist her stories about how her husband was egocentric, egotistical and didn't help in the household to how he abused her physically, financially and emotionally, how her family didn't help her at all and how her in-laws happily contributed in the abuse.\n\nGuess what? It was all overly exaggerated and a lot wasn't even true. I started to notice things didn't add up, like her telling about what someone from college advised her the other day, only for a week later for her to claim she hasn't heard from said college friend in months. Even then it took me a couple of years to just realise how toxic she was. Eventually I told her I needed some distance after she made me think she was in life threatening danger, with no answer from her for a week, only for her to call and say (cheerily i might add) \"oops, sorry, all just a big misunderstanding from my part :-)\".\n\nHer reaction on me wanting some space was to unfriend me on FB, so I cut her off completely.
