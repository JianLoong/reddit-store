{"id": 12903, "submission_id": "11ybqz9", "title": "AITA for asking my friend to change her wedding date?", "selftext": "I have a group chat with girls from college, one of them (Jazmin) is getting married.\nShe said she is getting married because she and her fianc\u00e9 were pregnant, she always comes to me when he cheats on her or when he is \u201cbad\u201d (he has a drug addiction) so I wasn\u2019t thrilled. \nWhen she told me about his addiction I said that she could be there for him but and it was her decision to continue to be with him. \nThen she told me that he had cheated many times, I said that I wouldn\u2019t be in a relationship like that but again it was her decision. \nShe said that she wanted to break up but she found out she was preg and the guy asked her to marry him so she said yes even tho she had thought of breaking up. \n\nNext week she called me crying bc she sadly had a miscarriage, I was sad and I tried to be supportive and helped her out with doctors appts and be there for her. \nShe said she didn\u2019t know if she wanted to continue with the wedding and I advised her to pospone it until she felt better and to think if she wanted to marry him or was she doing it for the baby. She got angry and stopped talking to me until she called me for advice again. \n\nThen she sent a msg to the group saying that the wedding was still on. She considered us for the date bc we all live 3hrs away from her.  \nShe said if June was okay, we said yes, but she said actually any weekend from June or July, I said I couldn\u2019t do it on the 2nd weekend bc it is my bday and my bf got flight tickets for a trip and I was really looking forward to it, but any other weekend on those 2 months was okay. \n(context: one time I missed Jazmins bday and she got upset and told me bdays are very special to her and I said that for me too. After that I have never missed her bday whereas she has never been to one of mine\u2019s. \nThere hasnt been an opportunity to spend my bday with my loved ones so I thought this year it could be different). \n\nShe sent a draft of the wedding invite with the date of my bday! I asked her if the date was set and she said yes. I told her that it is my bday and that she knew my plans. Another girl from the group got angry and said that a bday is not as big a priority as it is a wedding, and that I could celebrate another day, I explained that my bf bought the tickets on Dec and fixed his work schedule around to be free that date. \n\nJazmin replied that if I couldn\u2019t come it was ok. I said that I want to be there for her but I most likely couldn\u2019t change my trip. She said she couldn\u2019t move the date bc any other weekend there would be events in town (like a concert she said) and she wants her day to be special just for her. \nI asked to consider it and she sent me an angry emoji and kept sending wedding plans in the group.\nI feel bad bc others brides wouldn\u2019t have even asked and also  for advising her to break up and for my bf (who isn't invited to the wedding )for planning sth special for my bday. \nSo aita?", "created_utc": 1679472809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ybqz9/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_change_her_wedding/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You say she's never come to your birthday parties, whereas you always show up to hers. You've been very supportive through her miscarriage, and rightfully raised concerns about her cheating and drug addicting boyfriend. Is this person really that important to you, OP? By what you've described here it seems she's taking complete advantage of your good nature. If I were you I would prioritise the birthday trip with your boyfriend, and also seriously consider backing away from this \"friendship\"  altogether - you deserve to be treated with the same respect you've shown for them", "NTA. She picked the one date that definitely doesn't work for you, after you advised her to reconsider the wedding. She doesn't want you there and can't bring herself to say it. \n\nEnjoy your birthday. May it start a long tradition of only spending life events with people who put in the effort you deserve.\n\nAnd mute that group chat!", "NTA, she asked you which dates work for you and then went ahead and booked a date that didn\u2019t work for you. You tried to ask her if she can still change it but she said no. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong and I also wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to change my plans for a marriage that will most likely last a few months\u2026", "NTA, that is a mollusk, not a friend. Think about how much negative energy you can avoid by ending this so-called friendship. She is only interested in what she can get from you. By the sound of it she needs professional help. Btw, just in general we can stop trying to rank days on their importance, because it is entirely subjective.", "NTA she\u2019s done you a favor now really, go on your trip. The fact that you let her know your dates that don\u2019t work and she scheduled that specific time period tells you all you need to know about her. I\u2019m sorry this happened, but I would be questioning her if it was me.", "NTA. Remember that by her deciding to marry on your birthday, she's not only planning to make your next birthday about her, but has no intentions of ever celebrating your birthday. If her marriage lasts, she'll never be there on your day to celebrate you, and if her marriage fails, your birthday will always remind her of her failed marriage and become all about her and not you. It's not an AH move to do that to a distant friend or acquaintance, but it's a huge AH move to do that to a close friend.", "Nta\n\nWhy would you even want to witness your friend walking into het despair.\n\nHave a fun birthday.", "NTA\u2026 do you think she did it on purpose so you wouldn\u2019t come? She was quick to tell you it was ok if you can\u2019t come.", "NTA and if i was you i would keep my distance.she would add a lot of unnecessary drama in your life", "NTA -- She seems manipulative enough that she could have been using this to test your loyalty. Unfortunately, such a test proves *her* level of loyalty instead. Let her live her life, and if the other folks in that friend group want to have her back about it and not yours, let them all have each other. You can do better than them.", "NTA - She seems like a very toxic friend that only takes from you and gives nothing back.", "NTA. If you can't go, you can't go. Why bother asking for date suggestions if she's not going to take them?\n\nAlso, to plan her wedding on your birthday when she specifically stated that she wanted the day to be about her doesn't make sense. She seems confused with what she wants.", "> she wants her day to be special just for her.\n\nNow that's a lie. If she wanted a day just for her, she wouldn't have chose your birthday. \n\nNTA", "The thing is that it sounds like she intentionally picked your birthday because she knew you couldn\u2019t come. You\u2019re not exactly on board with the idea of her marrying this person\n\nNTA for asking but reevaluate your friendship", "NAH. She is ok with you missing it so just miss it. What exactly is the problem?", "NTA. Get rid of her, she\u2019s not your friend. I had someone who would leech off of me emotionally like this for years. They never change no matter how supportive you are of them. She doesn\u2019t deserve your pity and she sure as hell doesn\u2019t deserve your time and effort.", "You asked, she said no.. LET IT GO and you do you!. Your friend is doing it so why not you?. She doesn\u2019t care if the soon to be husband is an addict and most likely she will be divorcing him in no time. Go on your vacation with your boyfriend and turn your social media off when you are over there so you can relax and be present on your vacation. Your friend loves drama so let her have it.", "You told her in advance what dates were good for you. She scheduled those dates anyway.\n\n> She said she couldn\u2019t move the date bc any other weekend there would be events in town (like a concert she said) and she wants her day to be special just for her.\n\nHowever, it's fine you and your BF eats plane tickets (According to your \"friends\")\n\nPlus BF not even invited??????\n\nLive your life. I have a strong feeling that marriage won't last much anyway.\n\nNTA", "JFK are you some kind of crazy masochist? You are always there for her, she always ignores your advice, she doesn\u2019t care about your needs and she\u2019s marrying a cheater! If you lose contact now because you don\u2019t go to the wedding then you won\u2019t have to listen to the whining when the cheater cheats. That is a win. NTA\n\nEdit JFC", "NTA. Sounds like she did it on purpose to either test you as a friend or to exclude you.", "NTA I sympathize with your friends situation, but it sounds kinda like a one-sided friendship. I would advise you to think about all you've done and sacrificed for her in the past and all she has done and sacrificed for you. And if it seems you're all give and she's all take, then it may be time to start distancing yourself from her.", "NTA.  Goon your trip.   She needs to understand the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.   Plus the marriage won\u2019t last", "NTA. Sounds like it\u2019s been done on purpose so you couldn\u2019t go. Don\u2019t worry you can go to her next wedding.", "NTA\nWhy would she want her wedding on the same day as her friends? That\u2019s just dumb", "NTA\nFrom what you tell, your friend is what I call \"am emotional vampire\" b she'll suck you dry for advice and compassion, but never take anybody else in consideration. She may be fine with you not going to be there for the wedding, but she'll be sure to call you for the divorce.", "She chose the date if your birthday AND she didn\u2019t invite your bf? It was done on purpose. She is not your friend - she has told you that by her actions.\n\nEnjoy your trip away with your bf and have a fantastic birthday celebrating with him!", "NTA \n\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want you there. Go to your trip your bf planned and respect his efforts ( by going). Do not put your friend before your bf. She picked the date so you could miss the wedding. Take the hint, cut ties and be free of negative energy.", "NTA and she doesn\u2019t sound like a great friend to you either. Maybe you should be the one to postpone hanging out with her while you think about how this friendship is benefiting you. I think you\u2019ve grown out of this friendship but have gotten so used to being her emotional support that you forgot you are not required to put up with her behavior. She asked what dates you are free, you told her, she chose a date that did not work for you. DO NOT let her guilt you into thinking this was your fault or that going on your planned birthday trip is a slight toward her. She planned this wedding on your birthday, she can deal with you not being there. \n\nThis is all just a manipulation tactic used by toxic people. In her head you choosing your birthday over her wedding is failing some weird loyalty test that is entirely her own doing. I hope you can take some time away from her and realize she\u2019s demanding a ton from your friendship without putting in anything herself.", "NTA but I think she did this on purpose so you wouldn't be there to try to talk her out of making this bad decision since she confides in you more than the others.\n\nGo on your trip and enjoy. If she knows how bad this guy is and is marrying him anyway, then that is on her.", "NTA - what are you getting out of this relationship? I don\u2019t mean to sound unkind, but you seem to be a complete doormat for this woman. And I say this as someone who has done exactly the same for a woman who (in hindsight) doesn\u2019t even like me.\nDon\u2019t think for a second her decision to move the date to the only time you couldn\u2019t be there wasn\u2019t completely intentional. Lose her, respect yourself.", "NTA. \n\nBut you know she picked that date deliberately, right? You know exactly how shitty the groom is. She doesn\u2019t want to face someone who knows the truth of her relationship on her wedding day.", "NTA - tell her you will definitely be there for her next wedding.", "YTA\n\n\nThat you really absolutly expect her to change her wedding date because of you is mind blowing.", "Sounds like you need someone like you to advise you like you advised her. Doesn't look like this friendship is doing any good for you.", "YWBTA to ask her to change the date. The far better solution is for you to go on your planned birthday trip and stay away from these toxic people. What was the point of her asking you about your availability, and then scheduling her wedding on your birthday if not to cause you to cancel your trip? She did this on purpose. She is not your friend.", "Just drop out of the group chat and walk away from her.  I'm willing to bet she picked that day on purpose so she could start more drama with or about you.  She is not a friend", "You aren\u2019t friends. Step away from the drama.", "ESH\n\nYou don't ask someone to change their wedding date, you just don't go if you already have plans. I don't think your a bad friend at all, probably the only good one she has. She's a shitty friend though. And you shouldn't go to the wedding when you don't support the relationship.\n\nShe's shit because she is using you, and has been for a while. She throws a hissy fit because you didn't go to a birthday party but she hasn't been to any of yours? \n\nThis isn't a friendship, it's a give-take relationship and you're getting the crap end of the deal", "Why are you friends with her, exactly?  She sounds spiteful and exhausting.", "This reminds me of primary school. I went to a fast food restaurant for a girls bday. Waited an hour, no one showed up. (This was 90s no mobiles) \n\nOn Monday she said she was sorry the party was moved to another location because she didn\u2019t want another kid (Matt) to come, and she must have just forgot to tell me. \n\nIt was only years later that it clicked, she didn\u2019t want me there hahaha.", "\ud83d\udc19\ud83d\udc1a\ud83d\udc0c\u2620\ud83d\ude39", "This.\nAs someone who (not exactly but choice due to circumstances) has an anniversary the day after their own birthday, I can guarantee you that it will always be about the anniversary \"because that's about two people, the birthday is about one.\"\n(TBC it's friend and family treating the events like this, not my spouse)"]}
