I\u2019ve brought this up to my fianc\u00e9 to talk to his parents and brothers every time it happened. I said they either start sitting down or they don\u2019t use our bathroom. I feel I don\u2019t need to be cleaning grown boys urine in my own home. If their mom is ok with cleaning it at their house good for her, but it\u2019s disgusting to me. \n\nMore recently I went to go to the bathroom after they\u2019d left our home, and found one of them peed with the lid down (yes the lid, not the seat) which meant it got all over the toilet, its surroundings, and the floor, and travelled down the grout of the tile so it was EVERYWHERE. I was mad, showed my fianc\u00e9 (who is on my side, not sure if that matters) and he called his parents who said they\u2019d talk to his brothers. I don\u2019t bring this up personally with his parents because they don\u2019t really seem to care what I say. I believe it\u2019s because we don\u2019t want kids, and I feel might be that important. \n\nI reluctantly cleaned it up and had a discussion with my fianc\u00e9 that they\u2019re not using our bathrooms when they come over anymore. I said from now on their only option is the yard if they truly need to go, I\u2019m going to lock our bathroom doors when they\u2019re over since I gave them more than enough chances to change this behavior.  \n\nA few days later, his parents called me and started arguing saying their sons aren\u2019t dogs that have to be taken outside to go to the bathroom. I said if they\u2019re going to treat my bathroom like it\u2019s outside, they are going to be treated like dogs who need house training. Some more arguing and I was tired of it, so I said \u201cI know you feel a certain way about me because I don\u2019t want kids and you want more grandbabies, but this is exactly the reason I don\u2019t want any. All the boys in your family get away with everything they do simply because they\u2019re boys, and I don\u2019t want a raise a son who disrespects the women around him for whatever reason. I\u2019m surprised your oldest son (my fianc\u00e9) didn\u2019t end up like any of your others, he actually respects women and doesn\u2019t treat me like in his mommy.\u201d They were quiet and then hung up. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is still on my side because he sees how his brothers are being raised (they cherish boys and dislike girls in the family) but can\u2019t do anything about it. But the rest of his family members are blowing up my phone saying that was disrespectful and I should respect my soon to be in laws and that this is an unnecessarily hostile situation.

Taking a stand at your age about why you don't want kids because they'll be entitled or spoiled is a weird hill to die on.

If he was he would have found a way to address this with his family. But I think your outlook on his whole family is also not helpful. You're prejudice to them too.

They need repercussions, and at least this way you won't have to clean up their actual pee.", "ESH \n\nI was leaning towards NTA, but I'm guessing based on your comments that there's a little more going on here.\n\n1. Peeing with the lid down is obviously intentional, so we're left wondering why?\n\nYou've mentioned that the bathroom is your safe space, that you have to clean and sanitize it or it doesn't feel clean. That tells us that you're probably very particular about the bathroom, hyper-aware of anything, maybe even imagining a level of dirtiness. In fact, you say yourself that it's literally impossible for anyone else to clean your bathroom and it feel clean to you, so you know that your perception of the bathroom is not rooted in reality. That's fine, we all have our quirks.\n\nMy guess is that the boys probably did okay peeing before, but not perfect, certainly not with your admittedly impossible standards for your bathroom. \n\nYour complaints got them in trouble, and since the complaints happen every time they come over, probably even if they really try and think \"No way can she complain this time\"... and yet once again they're reported as \"peeing all over the place\"...\n\nAngry, feeling like no matter what they do it's never good enough, one of them decided to show you what \"peeing all over the place\" actually looks like.\n\nUnacceptable response from the kids of course, but maybe you should consider that even if they do their best it's probably going to \"feel dirty\" to you. While they certainly can do better than pissing on the lid, you already know how you are with the bathroom... are you sure you're not going to imagine that water droplets from the boys washing their hands are actually urine droplets? Do you think that maybe your admittedly extreme standards for the bathroom are going to render it impossible for you to fairly judge them as 11 & 12 year old boys?\n\nSeems like maybe if you want this to work out you need to take a long look at whether your behavior leading up to this has been a little over the top.", "ESH - The boys obviously need to not pee all over the place, but you aren't handling this well. If you're going to hold them to the standards of 'grown boys', then you need to treat them as such. Rather than asking your fiance to talk to his parents and ask them to talk to his brothers, YOU need to sit them down and do it. Bring it up nicely, ask them to please be more conscious of their aim when they're going to the bathroom, and let them know that if they make a mess, they'll be required to clean it up. If they don't know how, then teach them. You'll be giving them a valuable life skill and teaching them responsibility at the same time. But sending them out in the backyard like dogs isn't acceptable. If you don't want to go through any of the above, then don't allow them to come over to your house.", "ESH. You're making children piss outside in the yard because you're not adult enough to police them using the bathroom, instead waiting to check if there's a mess hours after they've left. \n\nIf you locked me out of your bathroom, I'd piss all over the hallway.", "YTA.\n\n it is absolutely UNHINGED that you are forcing literal CHILDREN to go pee in the yard. I was with you until then. Also, the completely unnecessary personal attack against your future in-laws was **WAY** out of line. There was absolutely no need to act that way or snap on them like that. \n\nA much easier and less unhinged way to handle this would have been to simply check your bathroom BEFORE they leave your house, and if they made a mess, make them clean it. \n\nI'm glad you decided not to have children because they would have an absolutely awful life with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know it seems I\u2019m being difficult about the cleaning part but it just doesn\u2019t feel clean to me unless *I* sanitize it. \n\nI should explain this now so others can see, but the reason they\u2019re over some days is because if not they\u2019re left at school or home alone and I feel bad. They\u2019re not really bad kids they just have terrible parents and are allowed to watch anything so I\u2019m sure they get this behavior from tv. \n\nI tried to put this in my post but it exceeded the 3000 character limit so I had to delete it unfortunately.", "> Bring it up nicely, ask them to please be more conscious of their aim when they're going to the bathroom\n\nThe kids peed on a closed toilet.

They don\u2019t get to leave your house till you have checked restrooms and they have cleaned.

In my experience, most people have at least one thing they're really picky about; in my case, it's how beds are made. No one else can make them to my specifications, so I don't ever expect anyone else to try. I even make my housemate's bed, not because he expects or wants me to, but because I just hate to have unmade (or poorly made) beds in my house \u2013 regardless of whether I sleep in them.

Also our home isn\u2019t child-proofed. \n\n**ILRFC**: The boys are pre-teens! \n\n**OPF**: Look, Mom and Dad, I\u2019m absolutely not judging. I know it must be really challenging to have not one but two children so far behind on developmental milestones. OP and I are absolutely happy to look up resources for life-skills training and even older-child respite care we could share with you, because we know you are doing your very best. \n\n**ILRFC**: Is this about OP being an evil useless woman who hates children?\n\n**OPF**: Hmm? Oh, no, OP actually loves kids. We both do. But we see how insurmountable the challenge of raising children who will be able to go out in public without nursemaids, and we firmly believe that we don\u2019t have the resources to bring a child into this world when even such amazing pillars of parenthood as yourselves are so far behind. \n\n**ILRFC**: This is stupid - you\u2019re just being difficult. We\u2019re coming over whether you like it or not. \n\n**OPF**: Sorry, we checked with our homeowner\u2019s insurance for remedying urine damage if the boys have more accidents and they advised us it\u2019s not covered. We really wanted to have you able to visit, and honestly we understand that these boys won\u2019t ever leave home because no roommates, friends, or mates will likely be willing to put up with their incontinence (I know, people are so mean!). So we argued with the insurance agent, and tried to explain the situation. They said they could only cover this damage if we submit documentation from the boys\u2019 medical teams explaining their condition. \n\n**ILRFC**: WHAT? You talked to a stranger about this? \n\n**OPF**: Oh yes, we even gave them your names so they would understand what upstanding members of the community and good parents you are. They wouldn\u2019t be swayed. In fact, it escalated and now they are threatening to drop us unless we either ban you from the property, register as a zoo, or take out extra insurance policies covering biohazards on the property. \n\n**ILRFC**: [*sputtering with inchoate rage*]\n\n**OPF**: Anywho, we\u2019re happy to meet for lunch somewhere instead.

If they decide to allow the boys over again, bathroom checks need to be done at least before they leave so that they can clean their own mess up.", "Whether they clean to your standards is somewhat irrelevant. If they're made to clean it up once or twice,  they'll likely get the message.\n\nYou can always go over it again after they've left.", "NTA,  but you can't have it both ways. You can't invite people to your home and then not allow them to use the restroom.  You're right their behavior is unacceptable . So either you don't allow them in your home or you make your fianc\u00e9 clean up after them. To me the easiest solution is not to have them in your home because that is really the only thing you have control over. You don't have control over how your in laws are raising them.", "Stand over them and tell them step by step how to do it. Every time they go to the bathroom, check it right after they come out. Better yet, teach your fianc\u00e9e exactly how you want the bathrooms cleaned, then have him check and stand over them", "I get that you want it cleaned to your standards, I truly do. \n\nI also understand your frustration with the issue. Especially as the bathroom is your safe place. \n\nYou ate child free, so you may not realize this, but where I live denying a child, you are assuming responsibility for free use and access to a bathroom would be considered abuse. Of course, this then allows them to focus on you as the \"bad guy\" and completely ignore the issue. \n\nSo, no, making them pee outside is NOT a good idea. \n\nIt really sounds like you care about these kids and are trying to help and be a good influence but are just completely out of your depth. \n\n\nFirst, you are in no way responsible for their behavior. Of course, that's on their parents and family. You say it's a wonder your bf turned out differently. But what made him realize that the behavior of his family of origin was completely messed up? Was it a mentor? A friend? A therapist?\n\nOne of the best ways to handle issues like this is to allow your bf to deal with problem family. \n\nI would suggest that your bf has a conversation with the two kids, \"man to man,\" and explain that he expects appropriate behavior in the house that belongs to BOTH of you. That it's disrespectful to you and as your bf HE will not tolerate them showing you disrespect. If he doesn't want his gf cleaning up his pee, why would he be OK with her cleaning up theirs? \n\nHe can ask them why they are behaving like that. Are they having bladder issues? Do they need help in some way? Are they waiting too long to pee? Do they need to be reminded to go? \n\nThey also make these tinkle target lights. To teach aim. \n\nAfter that, he needs to explain to them that he (or you bit I would really suggest that he takes the front with this)  will be checking the bathroom every time they pee and they will be doing a full clean of the toilet and floor each time they miss. \n\nI guarantee the behavior will stop within a visit or two. \n\nKids are smart. They can understand being spoken to like humans. They can be reasoned with as well. If they enjoy the time at your house, they will adapt. If they chose to stay home, rather than learn to use the toilet, then that's on them.", "They can come over but must use an invalid urinal. Then dump it out and clean.

Not the spray cleaner, obviously, but towels/wipes and having to rinse it out in the tub, for sure. It only took twice and (fingers crossed) it hasn't happened again.

You don't discipline them, you have them help \"heal\" the person they bit... apparently the empathy helps them realize they don't want to be hurt either.
