He's old enough to drink, to join the army, to live away from home, so I certainly hope he's passed high school by now.\n\nWhat you have is your son harassing your daughter over a non-issue.

It\u2019s not reasonable to expect that a girlfriend or wife will never spend time with a member of the opposite sex socially, professionally, or in a combination of the two. In this case what your daughter did is akin to grabbing food with a work colleague. Your son is signaling that if his future partner did something similar he would consider it cheating. That\u2019s a wildly outsized reaction and makes me suspect that he would be at best controlling and at worst abusive to women he\u2019s in a romantic relationship with.

I would be concerned that he's falling into some misogynistic influencer hole. Does he have a girlfriend? Does he have other \"questionable\" views? Since he's an adult, there's not much you can do there than keep him out of your house, but he's your son so I understand wanting to avoid that.\n\nThere is a LOT of radicalization of young males to get into some rather extreme and dangerous ideologies. That he insists your daughter did something \"wrong\", when she clearly didn't, is not a good sign. Be wary. NTA", "NTA- I would worry about the impact that that would have on your daughter as well. Because it could set her up to the expectation that she needs to act more submissive than she does. \n\nShe should be allowed to go get food with a friend without a partner freaking out.

Very weird, and you should be teaching your daughter not to tolerate men who think women can't be around other men, anyway. And sit your son down and make it clear his personal hang ups about his previous relationship should not be the problem of every woman in his life. He will encounter many women who are friends with men, go to class with them, and work with them. That doesn't mean they are cheating.

It's her relationship not his. \n\nAs a 22 yearold I don't think it's right for him to judge a 16 yearold's decisions to the same scrutiny as someone his own age either. Surely not to hold a grudge to his much younger sister over how she handles her own social life.\n\nSometimes we can't help how we feel and it definitely hits him in a soft spot.\n\nIf I'm understanding this correctly, he's not saying it infront of her, but complains to you in private to vent. And it sounds like his venting makes you angry. It is likely he is venting to you because he is upset with you defending a cheater in his eyes, and wants to change your mind.\n\nNow why does this upset him so much? He probably feels like you not seeing it as cheating invalidates his own hurt from being cheated on. Perhaps people defended the girl that cheated on him as well which is why his reaction is so strong. \n\nI'm not sure other than telling him this is non of his business (which it isn't) what can be done to ease his hurt. Definitely avoid bringing up the topic around him as it's likely your opinion that angers him.", "Your son is being a wussy about it.

Lack of details etc.", "You're NTA, your son is. His sister did nothing wrong, she's 16 for go-sake, not an age to be forming an unbreakable sacred bond to her soulmate.

YTA for raising him to feel this is ok.", "I'd say he got trust issues or something because got cheated on and he hasn't gone to therapy to fix these issues.\n\n\n\n(Also incels and MRA are absolutely not the same or even connected)", "He got cheated on, so I think it\u2019s far more personal than simply being misogynistic. He probably would actually treat a brother the same. It\u2019s the act he has a problem with, not her sex.", "it\u2019s not. going out to eat is literally a date", "I skimmed my bad", "Again, not for you to decide what is or is not a boundary that is considered cheating since its not your relationship. You can think its petty compared to your boundaries in yours. But this is a goalpost that moves as every relationship has different boundaries. Some people considered watching porn cheating. Its as simple as that. Itd be petty in my eyes too. Unfortunately young people at the age of 16 are still figuring things out and likely dont even know to discuss boundaries which sucks for the and yes it is HS drama. But that boy felt betrayed by it and our definitions dont change the feeling of betrayal he felt. And OP is not sensitive to that or her sons need for therapy and grace for the betrayal he is still healing from. Tough situation for sure.", "Yeah, I know.  22 year olds are often known for being dillholes, don\u2019t get me wrong", "I'm a bit worried about what YouTubers son is watching. He sounds radicalized.", "Pretty sure they\u2019re speaking specifically about the nonsense of the \u2018cheating\u2019 itself not the brother being a butthole.", "This his obsession with a 16 yo is CREEPY for him as a 22 yo", "It\u2019s very misogynistic and OP doesn\u2019t seem to grasp that part.", "Ok. I appreciate you taking the time to tell me. I really didn't understand before and do now.\n\nI wouldn't call it cheating I agree. I understand my words gave the wrong impression and were reaching.", "There's overlap between the two groups for sure. Heavy overlap.", "Also there are \"study dates\" guess people can't study together anymore damn", "I have been out to eat with plenty of people who I'm not dating. It's honestly controlling to think you can't eat platonicallu", "A date is only a date if the ppl involved agree that it is. Friends/classmates/coworkers can hang out platonically.", "I mean, he can decide if eating food with another guy is cheating, sure, but that has the consequence of making him a bad, unhealthy partner and one that the daughter is better off with. Anyone who tries to control how their partner spends time with friends or classmates/coworkers is straying dangerously into abusive territory. It's reasonable to make boundaries on romantic behaviors-like spending the night alone with another guy-your partner engages in, but it's *not* reasonable to make blundaries on platonic behaviors your partner engages in (unless they happen to cause harm in some way). Just bc you have the ability to set whatever boundaries you want, doesn't mean you're not an asshole if those boundaries are unreasonable or not communicated properly.\n\nAlso, just bc the guy is not *okay* with her eating with someone else and doesn't want to date a partner who is okay with that, doesn't mean he gets to call it cheating. If he has expectations outside of the norm, then he needs to have told her that at some point in their relationship. If he didn't and is retroactively calling her a cheater, then he's completely in the wrong.", "And even if she did cheat on her boyfriend, she was a teenager and he does not get to appoint himself the Morality Police and follow her around trying to verbally tack a Scarlet Letter on her for the rest of her life. He clearly needs to work on processing his issues in a constructive way.", "I wonder exactly what the brother\u2019s ex did to be called \u201ccheating.\u201d  Did she actually cheat or is he an abusive controlling jerk?", "Obvs. So many red flags that OP is brushing off as \u201csilly\u201d.", "then don\u2019t call it a date. literallt in the name. and yeah why have a study date with someone opposite gender 1 on 1?", "\u201ccontrolling\u201d. different people having different vibes in relationships is not controlling when those things are mutually agreed on", "yes but no. there are still implications even if you don\u2019t acknowledge them", "Yeah, id say young people dont discuss boundaries and dont have the knowledge base to do so til mistakes are made.. OPs daughter i hope learned very  valuable lesson about discussing boundaries. But is OP the AH for her insensitivity to her son? its fair to say both the daughter and her original bf suck because discussion beforehand would have prevented this. And that imo is a heathier outlook than OP blindly just defending her with 0 culpability. The son sucks because hes scorching earth on any thing close to infidelity, the mom kinda sucks because she is obviously just trying to get the son off the daughters back but isnt addressing his obvious needs for therapy. You have convinced me that EHS.", "Doesn't matter what she did. He's literally being abusive and controlling to the sister. Now, it may stem from him being cheated on, but he is absolutely abusing his sister.", "Random question- is it weird being so close in age to your students? I definitely understand the life experience/mentality being different post high school. But I imagine there are a lot of similar interests or experiences still.", "What implications", ">both the daughter and her original bf suck because discussion beforehand would have prevented this. And that imo is a heathier outlook than OP blindly just defending her with 0 culpability.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with OP defending her daughter. The daughter has no culpability in this if she never knew her bf's thoughts on this topic-it's fully on him to tell her what he's comfortable with in a relationship, just as it qould be fully her responsibility to tell him what *her* expectations are. She's not at fault for engaging in an innocent, platonic activity if she didn't know how her bf felt about it.", "No, not at all. Look at the comment they were responding to. And the fact that they said, \"Now the issue is the only one who can not let it go is her brother.\"", "Wow, a redditor who can read!", "possible ones. it\u2019s not black and white. it depends on the person you\u2019re going to eat with. yk what i mean?", "Imma be honest, I noticed that too and think OP might have been ignoring and brushing off serious red flags for awhile, because his behavior here is too WILD for and not out of nowhere.", "The original cheating accusation came from her prom date.  Hence the high school drama comment originally.  But yes brother needs to deal with his own issues.", "Wondering this much about someone else's life is so sad man, ur on reddit every second thinking about others and never about yourself", "I mean, they could still be saying it about that. That the brother should just let it go because it\u2019s silly high school drama?", "Yeah, no. There needs to be way more explanation. Of course every individual situation is going to be different, so what's your reason for thinking that *this* situation might have implications, bc it's not rational to make a blanket statement that *all* situations where two unrelated ppl eat a meal together are actually trying to date. \n\nIf the two ppl going out to dinner have openly/overtly \"subtly\" expressed interest or attraction toward each other, yeah, there are implications that it's more along the lines of a date. But we have no indication that's the case here. Two classmates who are celebrating a project they finished has no inherent romantic implications.\n\nI'm curious why you think there are romantic implications in getting a meal together. What about the activity screams romantic implications to you?", "Reading comprehension isn\u2019t your strong suit.", "What a bizarre remark from a complete stranger. All right then.", "because dates - especially first dates - are very frequently getting food.", "it must have bothered that guy and the brother for some reason. Maybe he noticed flirting. Maybe he didn\u2019t like that guy. Plenty of possible reasons. I personally don\u2019t go out to eat with male friends alone. There\u2019s simply no need for that in my eyes.", "See, I get the vibe that she has been failing him for awhile now, but still wants to brush this incident off as \u201csilly\u201d.", "So you're focusing on the activity itself instead of the intention behind it? Even though almost any activity you can do with your partner, you can do with a friend? In your opinion, does this extend to every other activity, like hiking and going to the movies?\n\nEdit: especially bc having dinner as a first date is a completely arbitrary social custom. Ppl don't have first dayes at restaurants bc it's an overwhelmingly large romantic activity, they do so bc it's relatively cheap, is one of the easiest ways to meet in public, odds are both ppl like food so they don't have to struggle finding an activity tailored to specific interests, and offers a good opportunity for ppl who are new to each other to talk about themselves and get to know the other person. Which, coincidentally, makes it an equally good option to get to know a friend or colleague."]}
