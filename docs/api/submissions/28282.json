He's old enough to drink, to join the army, to live away from home, so I certainly hope he's passed high school by now.\n\nWhat you have is your son harassing your daughter over a non-issue.

It\u2019s not reasonable to expect that a girlfriend or wife will never spend time with a member of the opposite sex socially, professionally, or in a combination of the two. In this case what your daughter did is akin to grabbing food with a work colleague. Your son is signaling that if his future partner did something similar he would consider it cheating. That\u2019s a wildly outsized reaction and makes me suspect that he would be at best controlling and at worst abusive to women he\u2019s in a romantic relationship with.

I would be concerned that he's falling into some misogynistic influencer hole. Does he have a girlfriend? Does he have other \"questionable\" views? Since he's an adult, there's not much you can do there than keep him out of your house, but he's your son so I understand wanting to avoid that.\n\nThere is a LOT of radicalization of young males to get into some rather extreme and dangerous ideologies. That he insists your daughter did something \"wrong\", when she clearly didn't, is not a good sign. Be wary. NTA", "NTA- I would worry about the impact that that would have on your daughter as well. Because it could set her up to the expectation that she needs to act more submissive than she does. \n\nShe should be allowed to go get food with a friend without a partner freaking out.

Very weird, and you should be teaching your daughter not to tolerate men who think women can't be around other men, anyway. And sit your son down and make it clear his personal hang ups about his previous relationship should not be the problem of every woman in his life. He will encounter many women who are friends with men, go to class with them, and work with them. That doesn't mean they are cheating.

It's her relationship not his. \n\nAs a 22 yearold I don't think it's right for him to judge a 16 yearold's decisions to the same scrutiny as someone his own age either. Surely not to hold a grudge to his much younger sister over how she handles her own social life.\n\nSometimes we can't help how we feel and it definitely hits him in a soft spot.\n\nIf I'm understanding this correctly, he's not saying it infront of her, but complains to you in private to vent. And it sounds like his venting makes you angry. It is likely he is venting to you because he is upset with you defending a cheater in his eyes, and wants to change your mind.\n\nNow why does this upset him so much? He probably feels like you not seeing it as cheating invalidates his own hurt from being cheated on. Perhaps people defended the girl that cheated on him as well which is why his reaction is so strong. \n\nI'm not sure other than telling him this is non of his business (which it isn't) what can be done to ease his hurt. Definitely avoid bringing up the topic around him as it's likely your opinion that angers him.", "Your son is being a wussy about it.

Step up and help your kids thru this ffs", "aH I haven't been out for a food orgy in a long time. I need to make that happen again.", "But it's not high-school drama. Your son is 22. A 22 year old is bullying a high schooler. He's got issues.", "It\u2019s high school drama for the actual high schoolers, not for the 22 y/o.", "You need to have a serious conversation with your son. His behavior is extremely concerning. Extremely concerning. \n\nPunishing his sister for the wrong doings of another is deeply troubling behavior.\n\nYou also need to make it clear to your daughter that her brother has crossed the line, that having a meal with boy/man when your in a relationship is not cheating, and that neither her brother nor her high school boyfriend had any reason to accuse her like this. \n\nFurther make it clear that their behavior is unacceptable.", "Your son is 22.  He's projecting a lot.  If he goes out with a girl that is a friend and he has a girlfriend, is he a cheater then?\n\nFrom how he is acting I would be worried about what he is consuming media wise.", "This is also some misogynistic BS. Her bf doesn't own her and she can get food with whomever she likes. Tell your son he's trying to set his sister up to be in a controlling and jealous relationship.", "Suggest he gets therapy for the chip on his shoulder before it gets to heavy and breaks him.", "Yes, the high school drama is silly, which is why your daughter's ex isn't the AH here. Your son is. He's being a massive AH. Your daughter is a minor, your son is not. You have a duty to protect your daughter from bullies like your son. He doesn't get to come to the house if he's going to be an AH to the people who live there. He can just leave, your daughter can't.", "From my experience the parents are mostly the ones who doesn't know the full detail of a high school drama, so I have a huge doubt about the accuracy of your words. So not leaving a judgement.\n\nI find it interesting too that you are the one getting offended. Feels like you are not saying something here.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Oh yeah, the kiddo's friends think \"talking\" to a guy when you were already \"talking\" to another guy is cheating.", "The contention is with a 22 year old, not a high schooler. The brother who won't let it go is 22.", "Yeah, and? Going to homecoming together doesn't equal chained together for life. I'd encourage daughter to break off with one boy before seeing another--but dating around a bit (no sex) is fine at that age.", "I need to tell my husband about all the lesbian orgies I've been having without even knowing.", "Ngl, getting Incel vibes", "And also, maybe teach the daughter not to put up with insecure bfs who accuse her of cheating for no reason? OP is a huge AH if s/he doesn't do this.", "He does.  Mom needs to have a talk with him about outdated attitudes, insecurity, and toxic possessiveness.\n\nBecause if he really believes that a girl having a male friend is \"cheating\" and cause for a freakout, he's going to ruin every relationship and potential relationship he will ever have.", "What a sad-ass thing it is for a 22-year-old dude to be THAT invested in a high-school romance. Especially when the \"cheating\" he's so up in his feels about basically amounts to \"eating food in the vicinity of another person.\"\n\nOP's son definitely has issues, the kind of issues that probably need to be addressed in therapy. He's going to grow into a bitter, lonely old man if he carries this attitude through his entire life.", "[removed]", "> It\u2019s high school drama for the actual high schoolers, not for the 22 y/o.\n\nThe mentality of your average 22 year old is not that different than a high schooler.", "Kind of assuming (and hoping) that a guy like that doesn\u2019t have any female friends.", "Why the fuck does he care about his teen sisters hs relationship.", "Oh for sure", "Male friend, male coworker, random male person she sat next to at a bar and talked to, etc. Her brother's being absurd.", "Yep. So many abusers say \u201cI was cheated on in the past so I need you to do x\u201d to excuse or justify control. He\u2019s headed that way.", "The dad is not doing anyone favors by calling this high school drama. The adult son is bullying his teenage sister. It's honestly disgusting that this dad is labeling this as silly. It's very toxic.", "I am a 22 year old and I\u2019m a substitute teacher at a high school. I\u2019m not getting involved in their drama because I understand that no matter what my \u201cmentality\u201d is, I\u2019m an adult and they\u2019re children, and their \u201cdrama\u201d is none of my business (outside of mandated reporting)", "Thankfully, that is not true.", "More worrisome than absurd.", "I was under the impression that the parent was referring to the ex as high school drama.", "Fair. I do wonder about OP repeatedly dismissing the situation as high school drama. Her daughter and ex-bf, whatever. The ex-bf may (hopefully) outgrow this attitude soon. A 22 year old who's likely finished college? Ehhhhh", "My adult son was served with a protective order after placing a tracker on his ex\u2019s car and leaving her threatening voicemails! How ~silly~\n\nI think very little of parents like OP, who are unconcerned when their children show signs of violent misogyny.", "I'm pretty sure OP is only talking about the daughter's ex considering what she did cheating when they say it's high school drama.", "I think OP has just understood that somewhere, she failed her son and needs to work on that. Otherwise she's probably be responding."]}
