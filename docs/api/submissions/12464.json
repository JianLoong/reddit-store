There is no other way to say it; I am not hot or even pretty by most people's standards. My sister (27F), \"Bella\" is one of the most beautiful women who has ever walked this planet. Like, got stopped on the street and in the mall multiple times while we were growing up for modeling opportunities. \n\nWe have different dads, and I guess she just won the genetic lottery. I was jealous of her as a kid, especially because we were always compared to one another. I'm 5'4, average body, slightly below average face. She's 5'11, thin, and all around just really gorgeous. \n\nShe's also a genuinely great person. She's humble and sweet, and even though she could've made a living off of her looks, she ended up going into social work and now works with kids in foster care. Her and I are close. We see one another a bit less since she moved to a new city with her husband, but we constantly text and call. I was her maid of honor two years ago at her wedding. \n\nFour months ago my fianc\u00e9 (30M), Allen, proposed to me and I said yes. My family was excited for me and they all like him. Him and I have been together for just over two years. Bella and Allen are close as well, and we often have them over for dinner or go to their house for game nights. \n\nNow to the issue. I thought about it a lot and decided to not have Bella in my bridal party. I just wanted one day where we weren't standing side-by-side, being compared. I wanted to be the pretty one standing at the alter on my day. I've gotten over my jealousy of her for the most part and accepted myself for how I look and who I am, but the thought of everyone looking at her at my wedding broke my heart. \n\nShe obviously thought she would be my maid of honor, and so before I asked anyone to be in my bridal party, I went to her house to talk to her. I didn't want her to hear through the grapevine or social media that she wasn't only not my maid of honor, but not in my bridal party at all. When I went over and told her and explained my reasoning, she started to cry. \n\nShe didn't get mad at me, but she said it was really hurtful that I'd exclude her because of the way she looks. I understand her point. Her and I are best friends. She's been giving me a bit of a cold shoulder since this happened, and my parents (both our mom and each of our dads) have called me a major AH for doing this to her, saying she's more upset than she let on but didn't want to taint \"my day\" with drama. She RSVP'd to the wedding invite, so I know she'll still be coming no matter what, but I feel bad that I have excluded her just because of her looks now. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678989701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11t1fzh/aita_for_not_making_my_sister_a_bridesmaid/", "score": 1101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no other way to say it; I am not hot or even pretty by most people's standards. My sister (27F), \"Bella\" is one of the most beautiful women who has ever walked this planet. Like, got stopped on the street and in the mall multiple times while we were growing up for modeling opportunities. \n\nWe have different dads, and I guess she just won the genetic lottery. I was jealous of her as a kid, especially because we were always compared to one another. I'm 5'4, average body, slightly below average face. She's 5'11, thin, and all around just really gorgeous. \n\nShe's also a genuinely great person. She's humble and sweet, and even though she could've made a living off of her looks, she ended up going into social work and now works with kids in foster care. Her and I are close. We see one another a bit less since she moved to a new city with her husband, but we constantly text and call. I was her maid of honor two years ago at her wedding. \n\nFour months ago my fianc\u00e9 (30M), Allen, proposed to me and I said yes. My family was excited for me and they all like him. Him and I have been together for just over two years. Bella and Allen are close as well, and we often have them over for dinner or go to their house for game nights. \n\nNow to the issue. I thought about it a lot and decided to not have Bella in my bridal party. I just wanted one day where we weren't standing side-by-side, being compared. I wanted to be the pretty one standing at the alter on my day. I've gotten over my jealousy of her for the most part and accepted myself for how I look and who I am, but the thought of everyone looking at her at my wedding broke my heart. \n\nShe obviously thought she would be my maid of honor, and so before I asked anyone to be in my bridal party, I went to her house to talk to her. I didn't want her to hear through the grapevine or social media that she wasn't only not my maid of honor, but not in my bridal party at all. When I went over and told her and explained my reasoning, she started to cry. \n\nShe didn't get mad at me, but she said it was really hurtful that I'd exclude her because of the way she looks. I understand her point. Her and I are best friends. She's been giving me a bit of a cold shoulder since this happened, and my parents (both our mom and each of our dads) have called me a major AH for doing this to her, saying she's more upset than she let on but didn't want to taint \"my day\" with drama. She RSVP'd to the wedding invite, so I know she'll still be coming no matter what, but I feel bad that I have excluded her just because of her looks now. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can possibly minimize them by apologizing and correcting now, but I've seen family relationships completely ruined over less than this slight. \n\nYou will recognize it one day, and that's why everyone here desperately wants you to take action now.

From your own story Bella is an amazing person and you're letting your own personal insecurities damage your relationship.

It's sounds like you two are closer than you with any of the other girls you asked to be your bridesmaids.  This is cruel, and your sister must be devastated.  Here she did nothing wrong, and you're punishing her for being beautiful.  I get why you did it, but that doesn't make it okay.  I think this will really leave a mark on your relationship.  You clearly haven't gotten over your feelings from years ago.  You're going to be the one wearing the big white dress, not her.  If anything, you should have had no bridal party rather than exclude your own sister that you're best friends with, too.  This really is horrible.  You've really got some work to do on yourself and reflecting.", "So as another commenter said, Soft YTA.\n\nIt is your big day, you want to shine and not want anyone to \"outshine\" you. Honestly, at a wedding everyone is always looking at the bride and groom during the ceremony unless someone is causing a scene or wearing something completely obscene. Even when a child ring bearer sits in the aisle, does a sommersault and walks on all fours, it is only momentary and then everyone will be back to looking at the bridge and groom. It won't be until afterwards at the reception that all the singles will be looking at the sister since you will be in the arms of your spouse.\n\nNow, I can understand your fear and worry, however I think you went about this the wrong way. From how you wrote your post, you made the decision, told her the decision and then told her the reasons why. A better way would have been to talk to her and explain your fears. If you were close she may have already known of your jealousy and would understand. Even if she didn't know about the jealousy, she would have understood (at least that it was bothering you about your special day). From there you could have come up with a plan together. She may have come up with a better solution, like she will tone down everything through makeup and clothes, or stand in a different spot (not beside the bride but on the other end) or whatever (don't flame me, but those were just random suggestions off the top of my head. I am sure there are better ones).\n\nBy making the decision without her (your sister who was expecting to be MoH and now isn't even in the bridal party) you hurt her. Imagine if she told you she didn't want you in the bridal party at all for her wedding. How would you feel? No reasoning is going to stop the hurt.\n\nJust my two cents. Congrats on the nuptials btw.", "Soft YTA. I feel compassion for your insecurities and understand that you want to feel your best at your wedding.\n\nBut this comparison-derived insecurity towards your sister is something you REALLY need to work on, both for your sake and hers. There will ALWAYS be someone better-looking, funnier, more intelligent, more successful, etc., than us. We have to make peace with this. It\u2019s just objectively wrong to exclude anyone for something they can\u2019t help, like their physical features. \n\nAdditionally, it makes me sad you have a low opinion of your looks. Beauty is subjective, despite the fact that society has brainwashed us into accepting strict beauty standards like symmetry and height. Consider saying \u201cfu*k that noise\u201d and learn to see yourself as beautiful. This isn\u2019t some fluffy feel-good shit\u2014 this is something you can really work to develop in your perception and belief system. There is something beautiful in all people, and we should seek to see that in ourselves. Look up runway models\u2014some of them, by traditional beauty standards, would be considered homely or even \u201cugly\u201d. But somebody saw the beauty and elegance and uniqueness in them. I hope you can do that for yourself.", "You don't have to have a wedding party, you know. Just forego having bridesmaids and groomsmen.", "Don't know if this helps or is an option. I went to a wedding where after walking in the bridesmaids sat to the side and the maid of honor sat in a chair to the side. The bride and groom were the center of attention.", "YES.", "I agree with the majority OP gentle YTA  I want to add in that while I consider myself pretty I gained a lot of stress weight on my 20s (probably like a size 14 st that time), whereas my maid of honor was still a size zero.   As the years have gone by any insecurities have long since faded and I just see how young and beautiful we ALL looked. I'm just happy to have precious pictures of me and my best friend the day I married my other best friend.

I guess all of you are taking it out on the wrong people. She doesn't make those people compare you to her, it wasnt her that made you feel less beautiful. But now you do kinda take it out on her. Although I feel the whole you punishing her for her looks speech is a bit superficial, because basically you re always at the short end of this comparison made by others but it is also not entirely wrong.

Your sister can't help her looks just like you can't help yours. It's your wedding and you can do what you want. But is it really worth it to potentially ruin your relationship with her over? If it's not too late, I think you should reconsider and ask her to be part of your bridal party and apologize to her.

It goes way deeper than that when you\u2019ve been constantly been made to feel less than because of your appearance. There is too much harm that\u2019s been done by the people who have compared y\u2019all. I\u2019d honestly recommend uninviting the family members that have compared you two completely. Don\u2019t tolerate any of that kind of commentary ever. Love yourself enough to kick those people out of your life.

If you cut your sister out of your bridal party, that\u2019s going to be felt by your family and possibly others in attendance. The last thing you want are side conversations about an imagined rift or people trying to guess why she\u2019s not in your bridal party. \n\nI understand your reasoning entirely (I also have an annoyingly beautiful sister), but I think this could actually impact your day in a far more negative way than having your sister in your wedding party ever could.", "Also I know this is kind of beside the point, but being considered beautiful is not the be all and end all.

A lot of times people that feel like what she did is OK believe cruel acts like this aren\u2019t a big deal because the harm of being excluded is outweighed by the benefits that come with being pretty. But being physically attractive brings a lot of unwanted attention too. OP is talking jealously about these modeling opportunities that people on the street would approach her sister about. I guarantee you and would put serious money down on those \u201cmodeling contracts\u201d being porn. Often times people who are pretty that get unwanted attention from coworkers, other people\u2019s husbands, and so on get blamed for bringing that attention on themselves. When in actuality, they did absolutely nothing to invite the behavior other than just exist. \n\nI get feeling insecure, I really do. I am around probably 40lbs heavier than both of my sisters, who were both MOH in my wedding. Watching my sisters try on bridesmaid dresses, where every single dress looked awesome on them did make me feel insecure, especially when I did my own wedding dress shopping and my anorexic mother was not subtle at all about how careful we were going to have to be with alterations to my wedding dress \u201cbecause the material wasn\u2019t very forgiving.\u201d I can only imagine how hurt they would have both been if I told them they weren\u2019t bridesmaids because their weight made me feel insecure.

It's not a requirement. The lack of it is not an insult, its just lack of specific praise for a specific thing. No, you probably aren't the smartest or the prettiest person in the room, or the one with the most interesting life story, nor the one with the highest salary or the hottest spouse etc etc. \n\nSo, should we just stop celebrating anything cool cause people can't stand the thought of themselves in some sense being average?
