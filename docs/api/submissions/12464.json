There is no other way to say it; I am not hot or even pretty by most people's standards. My sister (27F), \"Bella\" is one of the most beautiful women who has ever walked this planet. Like, got stopped on the street and in the mall multiple times while we were growing up for modeling opportunities. \n\nWe have different dads, and I guess she just won the genetic lottery. I was jealous of her as a kid, especially because we were always compared to one another. I'm 5'4, average body, slightly below average face. She's 5'11, thin, and all around just really gorgeous. \n\nShe's also a genuinely great person. She's humble and sweet, and even though she could've made a living off of her looks, she ended up going into social work and now works with kids in foster care. Her and I are close. We see one another a bit less since she moved to a new city with her husband, but we constantly text and call. I was her maid of honor two years ago at her wedding. \n\nFour months ago my fianc\u00e9 (30M), Allen, proposed to me and I said yes. My family was excited for me and they all like him. Him and I have been together for just over two years. Bella and Allen are close as well, and we often have them over for dinner or go to their house for game nights. \n\nNow to the issue. I thought about it a lot and decided to not have Bella in my bridal party. I just wanted one day where we weren't standing side-by-side, being compared. I wanted to be the pretty one standing at the alter on my day. I've gotten over my jealousy of her for the most part and accepted myself for how I look and who I am, but the thought of everyone looking at her at my wedding broke my heart. \n\nShe obviously thought she would be my maid of honor, and so before I asked anyone to be in my bridal party, I went to her house to talk to her. I didn't want her to hear through the grapevine or social media that she wasn't only not my maid of honor, but not in my bridal party at all. When I went over and told her and explained my reasoning, she started to cry. \n\nShe didn't get mad at me, but she said it was really hurtful that I'd exclude her because of the way she looks. I understand her point. Her and I are best friends. She's been giving me a bit of a cold shoulder since this happened, and my parents (both our mom and each of our dads) have called me a major AH for doing this to her, saying she's more upset than she let on but didn't want to taint \"my day\" with drama. She RSVP'd to the wedding invite, so I know she'll still be coming no matter what, but I feel bad that I have excluded her just because of her looks now. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678989701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11t1fzh/aita_for_not_making_my_sister_a_bridesmaid/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who cares what Auntie Mary's husband's brother thinks? \n\nLook at it this way, which is what I did with my much better looking best friend on my wedding day. Everyone is expecting Bella to look fabulous all the time. There's no surprise in it for anyone who knows you both. But you... you're going to be dressed up to the nines, special make up and hair.

What's next? Kicking her out of the family photos? She can't help that she is pretty just as any of us can't help our genetic lottery.\n\nAlso - you're the bride!

There is no other way to say it; I am not hot or even pretty by most people's standards. My sister (27F), \"Bella\" is one of the most beautiful women who has ever walked this planet. Like, got stopped on the street and in the mall multiple times while we were growing up for modeling opportunities. \n\nWe have different dads, and I guess she just won the genetic lottery. I was jealous of her as a kid, especially because we were always compared to one another. I'm 5'4, average body, slightly below average face. She's 5'11, thin, and all around just really gorgeous. \n\nShe's also a genuinely great person. She's humble and sweet, and even though she could've made a living off of her looks, she ended up going into social work and now works with kids in foster care. Her and I are close. We see one another a bit less since she moved to a new city with her husband, but we constantly text and call. I was her maid of honor two years ago at her wedding. \n\nFour months ago my fianc\u00e9 (30M), Allen, proposed to me and I said yes. My family was excited for me and they all like him. Him and I have been together for just over two years. Bella and Allen are close as well, and we often have them over for dinner or go to their house for game nights. \n\nNow to the issue. I thought about it a lot and decided to not have Bella in my bridal party. I just wanted one day where we weren't standing side-by-side, being compared. I wanted to be the pretty one standing at the alter on my day. I've gotten over my jealousy of her for the most part and accepted myself for how I look and who I am, but the thought of everyone looking at her at my wedding broke my heart. \n\nShe obviously thought she would be my maid of honor, and so before I asked anyone to be in my bridal party, I went to her house to talk to her. I didn't want her to hear through the grapevine or social media that she wasn't only not my maid of honor, but not in my bridal party at all. When I went over and told her and explained my reasoning, she started to cry. \n\nShe didn't get mad at me, but she said it was really hurtful that I'd exclude her because of the way she looks. I understand her point. Her and I are best friends. She's been giving me a bit of a cold shoulder since this happened, and my parents (both our mom and each of our dads) have called me a major AH for doing this to her, saying she's more upset than she let on but didn't want to taint \"my day\" with drama. She RSVP'd to the wedding invite, so I know she'll still be coming no matter what, but I feel bad that I have excluded her just because of her looks now. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you two are/were as close as you claim, then others, especially friends and family, will have noticed. You were so caught up in being the center of attention in a positive manner that you\u2019ve now opened the door for people to wonder what happened between you two to make you snub her not only from the MoH position, but from the bridal party entirely. I guarantee that will be a hushed topic of conversation during and after your wedding, meaning you\u2019ve now brought negative attention to your wedding\u2026 and you\u2019ll make it even worse if you tell any of those people WHY\u2026", "Soft YTA, but have you actually realised everyone is just going to ask why she isn't in the bridal party and you're going to have to say \"because I feel unpretty\" and listen to all the awkward comments.

They are a toxin that is poisoning your relationship with your sister.", "NAH. Everyone is being WAY too harsh on you, OP. \n\nThat said, have you considered not having a bridal party at all so that you're not singling Bella out?

Better have her in the background as MOH, no one would think twice and no one would look at her next to the stunning bride.", "Great point, fellow Redditor! \n\nLast thing you want is drama during the wedding with people expressing surprise she's not in the wedding party, especially if you two are close, OP. That's going to inspire a lot of gossiping. \n\nOP, you may not-on-purpose draw MORE attention to her by excluding her from your wedding party.\n\nI get that this is a sore spot for you - your family didn't help with your self esteem, and that's something you'll have to work on, maybe with therapy - but you have to try to see the downstream consequences of this decision.", "This is so well said and a great point. Even looking at this most practically, the cons of the inevitable gossip if your sister is not in the wedding party outweigh any perceived \u201cpro\u201d of not having your sister standing next to you and taking the spotlight.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like she will be seeking any attention from you with her behavior. So I can\u2019t imagine anyone so hideous that their loved ones would not be entirely focused on the bride on that day. I think that if you focus on the other details, by the time the wedding day comes, you will feel like a star at the altar.", "This. If the positions were reversed, and OP weren\u2019t her MOH because of her looks, she would be rightfully devastated.
