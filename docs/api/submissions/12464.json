There is no other way to say it; I am not hot or even pretty by most people's standards. My sister (27F), \"Bella\" is one of the most beautiful women who has ever walked this planet. Like, got stopped on the street and in the mall multiple times while we were growing up for modeling opportunities. \n\nWe have different dads, and I guess she just won the genetic lottery. I was jealous of her as a kid, especially because we were always compared to one another. I'm 5'4, average body, slightly below average face. She's 5'11, thin, and all around just really gorgeous. \n\nShe's also a genuinely great person. She's humble and sweet, and even though she could've made a living off of her looks, she ended up going into social work and now works with kids in foster care. Her and I are close. We see one another a bit less since she moved to a new city with her husband, but we constantly text and call. I was her maid of honor two years ago at her wedding. \n\nFour months ago my fianc\u00e9 (30M), Allen, proposed to me and I said yes. My family was excited for me and they all like him. Him and I have been together for just over two years. Bella and Allen are close as well, and we often have them over for dinner or go to their house for game nights. \n\nNow to the issue. I thought about it a lot and decided to not have Bella in my bridal party. I just wanted one day where we weren't standing side-by-side, being compared. I wanted to be the pretty one standing at the alter on my day. I've gotten over my jealousy of her for the most part and accepted myself for how I look and who I am, but the thought of everyone looking at her at my wedding broke my heart. \n\nShe obviously thought she would be my maid of honor, and so before I asked anyone to be in my bridal party, I went to her house to talk to her. I didn't want her to hear through the grapevine or social media that she wasn't only not my maid of honor, but not in my bridal party at all. When I went over and told her and explained my reasoning, she started to cry. \n\nShe didn't get mad at me, but she said it was really hurtful that I'd exclude her because of the way she looks. I understand her point. Her and I are best friends. She's been giving me a bit of a cold shoulder since this happened, and my parents (both our mom and each of our dads) have called me a major AH for doing this to her, saying she's more upset than she let on but didn't want to taint \"my day\" with drama. She RSVP'd to the wedding invite, so I know she'll still be coming no matter what, but I feel bad that I have excluded her just because of her looks now. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678989701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11t1fzh/aita_for_not_making_my_sister_a_bridesmaid/", "score": 404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone is expecting Bella to look fabulous all the time. There's no surprise in it for anyone who knows you both. But you... you're going to be dressed up to the nines, special make up and hair.

What's next? Kicking her out of the family photos? She can't help that she is pretty just as any of us can't help our genetic lottery.\n\nAlso - you're the bride!

There is no other way to say it; I am not hot or even pretty by most people's standards. My sister (27F), \"Bella\" is one of the most beautiful women who has ever walked this planet. Like, got stopped on the street and in the mall multiple times while we were growing up for modeling opportunities. \n\nWe have different dads, and I guess she just won the genetic lottery. I was jealous of her as a kid, especially because we were always compared to one another. I'm 5'4, average body, slightly below average face. She's 5'11, thin, and all around just really gorgeous. \n\nShe's also a genuinely great person. She's humble and sweet, and even though she could've made a living off of her looks, she ended up going into social work and now works with kids in foster care. Her and I are close. We see one another a bit less since she moved to a new city with her husband, but we constantly text and call. I was her maid of honor two years ago at her wedding. \n\nFour months ago my fianc\u00e9 (30M), Allen, proposed to me and I said yes. My family was excited for me and they all like him. Him and I have been together for just over two years. Bella and Allen are close as well, and we often have them over for dinner or go to their house for game nights. \n\nNow to the issue. I thought about it a lot and decided to not have Bella in my bridal party. I just wanted one day where we weren't standing side-by-side, being compared. I wanted to be the pretty one standing at the alter on my day. I've gotten over my jealousy of her for the most part and accepted myself for how I look and who I am, but the thought of everyone looking at her at my wedding broke my heart. \n\nShe obviously thought she would be my maid of honor, and so before I asked anyone to be in my bridal party, I went to her house to talk to her. I didn't want her to hear through the grapevine or social media that she wasn't only not my maid of honor, but not in my bridal party at all. When I went over and told her and explained my reasoning, she started to cry. \n\nShe didn't get mad at me, but she said it was really hurtful that I'd exclude her because of the way she looks. I understand her point. Her and I are best friends. She's been giving me a bit of a cold shoulder since this happened, and my parents (both our mom and each of our dads) have called me a major AH for doing this to her, saying she's more upset than she let on but didn't want to taint \"my day\" with drama. She RSVP'd to the wedding invite, so I know she'll still be coming no matter what, but I feel bad that I have excluded her just because of her looks now. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can possibly minimize them by apologizing and correcting now, but I've seen family relationships completely ruined over less than this slight. \n\nYou will recognize it one day, and that's why everyone here desperately wants you to take action now.

From your own story Bella is an amazing person and you're letting your own personal insecurities damage your relationship. That she's still willing to come to the wedding at all after what you said to her speaks a lot to her character. Personally I probably wouldn't go. You picked a really cruel way to let Bella know you aren't her friend. Friends don't hurt each other like that.", "YTA.  It's sounds like you two are closer than you with any of the other girls you asked to be your bridesmaids.  This is cruel, and your sister must be devastated.  Here she did nothing wrong, and you're punishing her for being beautiful.  I get why you did it, but that doesn't make it okay.  I think this will really leave a mark on your relationship.  You clearly haven't gotten over your feelings from years ago.  You're going to be the one wearing the big white dress, not her.  If anything, you should have had no bridal party rather than exclude your own sister that you're best friends with, too.  This really is horrible.  You've really got some work to do on yourself and reflecting.", "So as another commenter said, Soft YTA.\n\nIt is your big day, you want to shine and not want anyone to \"outshine\" you. Honestly, at a wedding everyone is always looking at the bride and groom during the ceremony unless someone is causing a scene or wearing something completely obscene. Even when a child ring bearer sits in the aisle, does a sommersault and walks on all fours, it is only momentary and then everyone will be back to looking at the bridge and groom. It won't be until afterwards at the reception that all the singles will be looking at the sister since you will be in the arms of your spouse.\n\nNow, I can understand your fear and worry, however I think you went about this the wrong way. From how you wrote your post, you made the decision, told her the decision and then told her the reasons why. A better way would have been to talk to her and explain your fears. If you were close she may have already known of your jealousy and would understand. Even if she didn't know about the jealousy, she would have understood (at least that it was bothering you about your special day). From there you could have come up with a plan together. She may have come up with a better solution, like she will tone down everything through makeup and clothes, or stand in a different spot (not beside the bride but on the other end) or whatever (don't flame me, but those were just random suggestions off the top of my head. I am sure there are better ones).\n\nBy making the decision without her (your sister who was expecting to be MoH and now isn't even in the bridal party) you hurt her. Imagine if she told you she didn't want you in the bridal party at all for her wedding. How would you feel? No reasoning is going to stop the hurt.\n\nJust my two cents. Congrats on the nuptials btw.", "Soft YTA. I feel compassion for your insecurities and understand that you want to feel your best at your wedding.\n\nBut this comparison-derived insecurity towards your sister is something you REALLY need to work on, both for your sake and hers. There will ALWAYS be someone better-looking, funnier, more intelligent, more successful, etc., than us. We have to make peace with this. It\u2019s just objectively wrong to exclude anyone for something they can\u2019t help, like their physical features. \n\nAdditionally, it makes me sad you have a low opinion of your looks. Beauty is subjective, despite the fact that society has brainwashed us into accepting strict beauty standards like symmetry and height. Consider saying \u201cfu*k that noise\u201d and learn to see yourself as beautiful. This isn\u2019t some fluffy feel-good shit\u2014 this is something you can really work to develop in your perception and belief system. There is something beautiful in all people, and we should seek to see that in ourselves. Look up runway models\u2014some of them, by traditional beauty standards, would be considered homely or even \u201cugly\u201d. But somebody saw the beauty and elegance and uniqueness in them. I hope you can do that for yourself.", "You don't have to have a wedding party, you know. Just forego having bridesmaids and groomsmen.", "Don't know if this helps or is an option. I went to a wedding where after walking in the bridesmaids sat to the side and the maid of honor sat in a chair to the side. The bride and groom were the center of attention.", "YES.", "I agree with the majority OP gentle YTA  I want to add in that while I consider myself pretty I gained a lot of stress weight on my 20s (probably like a size 14 st that time), whereas my maid of honor was still a size zero.   As the years have gone by any insecurities have long since faded and I just see how young and beautiful we ALL looked. I'm just happy to have precious pictures of me and my best friend the day I married my other best friend.

I guess all of you are taking it out on the wrong people. She doesn't make those people compare you to her, it wasnt her that made you feel less beautiful. But now you do kinda take it out on her. Although I feel the whole you punishing her for her looks speech is a bit superficial, because basically you re always at the short end of this comparison made by others but it is also not entirely wrong.

Your sister can't help her looks just like you can't help yours. It's your wedding and you can do what you want. But is it really worth it to potentially ruin your relationship with her over? If it's not too late, I think you should reconsider and ask her to be part of your bridal party and apologize to her.

And I understand the desire to have one day where you're the one getting attention.\n\nBut you love your sister and say she's your best friend. And in ten, fifteen years when you look back on your wedding photos and the memories; you're going to be sad that she's not in them. You'll remember that you lost out on having your best friend there with you.", "Well said. Most people that know OP and Bella won't care if Bella is in wedding party. There will be more attention on Bella if she's not part of the wedding party.", "I wasn\u2019t in the bridal party at my brother\u2019s wedding and everyone asked me why. My other brother was a groomsman and my SIL\u2019s sister was a bridesmaid. Literally every single family member asked me why I wasn\u2019t in the bridal party. Six years later and I\u2019m still hurt by it and it has definitely negatively impacted my relationship with my brother and SIL.\n\nEDIT: very soft YTA.  When I got married one year after my brother, I just didn\u2019t have a bridal party.  That way I didn\u2019t have to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings.", "How\u2019s this a soft YTA? Not including someone at such a special event bc of how they look is major AH behavior.", "I agree with the incredibly soft YTA part...but you're wrong.  The bride will be looked at but almost every single man there will be ogling the sister and the married men will too but hoping they're not caught.  Then of course there's the whole reception drama.  I feel for this young woman...the ONLY way she can escape this predicament IMO is to elope.", "Agreed. Your sister should be a bridesmaid and you shouldn't let insecurity ruin your big day. You'll want to experience it with her !", "exactly. now you've created drama. my cousin was in a similar situation. she is thick, beautiful in my opinion, but her half-sister was a literal model and not nice, sweet or humble. but they went through hell together growing up bc of their shitty parents, so guess who was plain-janes maid of honor - the bombshell. And guess who cared? fucking no one.", "It depends on the family. I wasn't in my younger sister's wedding party. I was living overseas at the time and traveled to the wedding. It never even occurred to me I should be in the wedding party. Both of our stepsisters were, but they lived locally to her.", "*Now, the question \"What happened between the sisters?*\n\nMaybe. I guess she could let it be known she was going the traditional route and only having single bridesmaids. So a Maid of Honor instead of a Matron. This was once pretty common.  NTA", "I have to agree with this. My sister looks like Barbie and I spent a lot of time in her shadow. The literal only time I was asked to a school dance it was because a boy wanted to \u201cask me about homecoming after class\u201d and then he asked me if my sister had a date (obviously she did).\n\nHowever my sister was still my MOH because she was always there for me and my insecurities were my fault and not hers. My wedding was the best day of my life and I had no concerns of her outshining  me because the groom had 0% interest in her. \n\nOp if this is your best friend you have done her dirty. Stop caring about what random people think and care about your husband who you should know will only be looking at you.", "Here\u2019s the thing: everyone at the wedding likely won\u2019t care. Well, maybe aunt Jen\u2019s brothers sisters friend might think \u201cwow she\u2019s attractive\u201d about her sister, but no one who\u2019s actually worth a damn will care. Plus, it won\u2019t be anything more than a quick \u201cshe\u2019s pretty\u2026 anyways\u201d in their mind. \n\nEveryone will be happy for OP since they\u2019re going to be the star of the show.", "She also claimed she and her sister are best friends but I\u2019d be hard pressed to find actual best friends that would be in this position.", "Exactly where my mind went. OP\u2019s sister is probably upset about not being the MoH but she\u2019s prob more upset and hurt finding out that her sister truly is not her best friend. OP\u2019s sister is trying to piece together in her mind how she was a horrible sister somehow to OP for OP to act like this. If she ever said anything about OP\u2019s looks, her height, her beauty, OP\u2019s sister is going through all of her memories looking for a reason why OP has effectively just shut her out of what she prob thought was going to be another amazing bonding experience between the two.", "Agree. OP does seem kind of ugly, but not because of her looks.", "Are you gonna add a judgement to that rude comment, fellow asshole? Op is TA, but I don\u2019t think she is shallow for her thoughts right now. She has clearly been compared to her sister her entire life and is wanting to have a day where she shines, rightfully so, and this issue is making her confront her insecurities head on, which is something tough to deal with. She is looking at the issue the wrong way, but her worries don\u2019t make her shallow when she clearly loves her sis. Insecurity is hard and weddings are stressful, not to mention the perfection-seeking, expensive wedding culture in the US adding an extra layer to everything.", "I have an awful feeling that the sister might actually cover for OP :(", "You think the sister as the asshole? The woman who\u2019s taken this slight incredibly gracefully and has done nothing to change OPs mind? She hasn\u2019t even shared her feelings, and she\u2019s prioritizing the bride over her own hurt\u2026 but yeah. She\u2019s the AH. Sure.", "That\u2019s a very sad reason to not have a bridal party.", "Or...OR...Bella's upset because the person she considered her best friend told her \"I don't want you to be my maid of honor because of how you look.\"", "To add, I think you\u2019ve lost sight of what a wedding is meant to be", "But your sister knew it wasn't true...OP's sister knows it's the exact reason. So imagine what that's gonna do with the gossip of the day.", "Right? Let's replace \"too pretty\" with \"too ugly\". Too old. Too tall. Too fat. Too weird. Too whatever. I can't even imagine leaving my sister out of my wedding party because of looks, or even worse, because of my insecurity about looks.", "My view exactly. Not going to be close anymore.", "Don\u2019t ostracize your sister. She seems to really love and care about you. Why risk messing with the relationship just bc you\u2019re worried that she\u2019ll steal your Thunder? Just be happy to have a kind and supportive sister. She won\u2019t forget this and it\u2019ll likely bother her for a while.\n\nGoing forward, she could worry that you\u2019re always hyper fixated on how she looks. It could impact the way she dresses or acts around you, as she may actually be insecure about her looks now. No one wants to think that they\u2019re upsetting someone due to how they look, whether they\u2019re attractive or not. She is who she is.", "And also everyone will be whispering about how you were jealous and that's why you cut your sister out of the bridal party if you do it. You'll be inadvertently making it about her.", "The people come to your wedding to cherish you and your groom. They come just for you both. Not for your sister. Their eyes will be on you. Don't forget this. It is a day to enjoy. Your happiness will make you shine. \n\nDon't make decision out of insecurities that you will regret later. You bridal party is your support. It is more as standing beside you. So maybe go inside yourself. And don't forget: your sis will still show up as a guest. Some kind of attention will be there. But in your bridal party you at least know how she will be dressed.", "It's true though! There is no way she will outshine you on your day and you both deserve to have the moment together \ud83d\udc96", "I am expecting an update telling us that you listened to the consensus and your sis was your MoH and you had the most fabulous wedding looking the amazing you that you are. \nHopefully everything goes well for you. \nCongratulations on your engagement \ud83d\udc95", "I think you are missing the point. \n\nWhat if she hadn't had you in her wedding party because of your looks...that you wouldn't look 'right' next to her, or that you just weren't pretty enough to be in her wedding party.  You would be justifiably upset and hurt.  Hurt, because not being in your sister's wedding party is hurtful.\n\nYTA", "Her looks don\u2019t take anything away from you, either. That\u2019s all in your head. Have her looks taken away your ability to get married? Get a job? Have friends? \n\nThis victim mentality is telling me that you need a therapist ASAP, and I say that in the nicest way possible. It\u2019s not healthy to victimize yourself over the looks of someone else, something they cannot control. \n\nI don\u2019t even think you\u2019re an AH, you\u2019re just really insecure (which is ok), but something you seriously need to work on if you want to continue to have a healthy relationship with your sister.", "If you're as ugly as you seem to think, I'm sure people would be judging her for having a mountain troll with her.", "What if when your sister/best friend got married she told you that you couldn't be in her bridal party because you're too average looking and not pretty enough and she wouldn't want to mess up the aesthetic in her wedding pictures? You would be devastated, and she would be the one getting disappointed calls from your parents. YTA.", "Her looks take nothing away from you", "Then do something to make yourself feel special without throwing your sister under the bus. Honestly, if I was her I would consider your behaviour as a revelation of your true character and I\u2019d cut you out of my life", "So don't invite the people who would make you feel bad by doing that. Easy peasy.", "This is so shallow that I don\u2019t even know what to say.", "Yeah. She was wrong to exclude her sister, but the depth of her pain hurt me.\n\nOP, nobody will be looking at any of your bridesmaids; you will be the glowing center of your wedding. Please know this and repair your very important relationship with your sister. You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't.", "If you are mature enough to get married you should be mature enough not to prejudge people\u2019s reactions.\n\nWhy can\u2019t you just have the people you want at your wedding?\nIf she thinks some folks won\u2019t give her enough attention, then she has the option of choosing not to invite them.\n\nShe is putting what she thinks other\u2019s behavior will be ahead of her sisters feelings.\n\nMost of the people I know who have gotten married in the last ten yrs, eloped.\nIt\u2019s more romantic than dealing with a bunch of relatives on your wedding day and you can always have a separate party.", "She didn\u2019t share her feelings? Except to tell her sister how hurtful it was. Except to tell her parents (flying monkeys) how she\u2019s more \u201cupset\u201d than she\u2019s letting on but doesn\u2019t want to create more drama, while creating more drama? This could have been handled quietly between two sisters.", "I am joking/exaggerating slightly, it was also about not wanting to share the attention as a general principle. But I'm very happy I went without a bridal party and I suspect that might be a good compromise for OP.", "Totally agree. It's just a day where she wants to feel special and beautiful, without the constant comparisons she's been subjected to all her life. She probably needs therapy, but that's not going to change overnight how she feels and how uncomfortable it is to know she's being compared. NTA", "I respectfully disagree. The sister sounds like a genuinely good person and their relationship sounds fantastic. So imagine the pain she feels now that she isn't in the bridal party just because of the way she looks. I feel the sisters pain. I also feel OP pain. I think this is a no one's ta situation", "100%", "Love this!!!", "It\u2019s real life. Good for you if you\u2019ve never had a hang up relating to your looks, but most people do. Again, OP is not asking her be frumpy or unkempt, just not in the spotlight. If OP sister isn\u2019t shallow and looking for any unwarranted attention then she\u2019ll understand. If I know my intentions are pure, then I\u2019d happily empathize and accommodate a sibling, especially when it comes to no cost to me!"]}
