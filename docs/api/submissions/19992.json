{"id": 19992, "submission_id": "14cqwm2", "title": "AITA for not paying in full", "selftext": "A close friend's girlfriend had invited a load of friends down to her home near London for the weekend. There were 12 of us in total, mostly couples, all fairly close mates. She planned a big meal for both the Friday and Saturday night. Closer to the date, she asked us all if we could chip in some money to contribute towards the food and some booze (soft drinks and maybe some beers) she was going to go buy from the supermarket. Everyone was asked to bring their own booze (spirits, more beers). This all sounds totally normal and fine! I think she asked for \u00a330 from each couple. \n\nThe problem is, my girlfriend and I were only available to come for the Saturday night (I let my friend know a few weeks in advance). I messaged the friend privately and said something like 'heya, so as we're only staying for 1 night, would you want a bit less money from us? :) ' (hoping that \u00a315 would be more accurate). My thought was she'd simply forgotten to calculate for us/forgot we weren't gonna be there for the Friday evening meal and drinks. But her reply was along the lines of 'wow, that's cheeky guys... I mean, I guess you could pay less...'. But now it was very awkward and we simply paid the full amount. It's left a lingering tone for a while, but we're still friends. (This occurred a while ago).\n\nGranted, \u00a330 ($40) isn't that much and she did put a lot of effort in to go out and get the food and drink... but whilst everyone was enjoying a big meal together on the Friday night, we were at home having leftovers and juice infront of the TV (we had to be home for saturday morning before you ask...).\n\nEdit: I should also add, the first meal (the one I wasn\u2019t there for) was bbq, meats etc. the second evening the meal was more of a cheese & breads scenario. I\u2019ll let you decide if that helps sway the ass decision!\n\nEdit2: this happened 3-4 years ago when we were in our mid-late 20s. My friend (the host) probably can\u2019t even remember this situation but I\u2019ve just been curious, then found AITA recently!", "created_utc": 1687111608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cqwm2/aita_for_not_paying_in_full/", "score": 1899, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She asked for very little money, even if you were going for that night.  She also spent all that time prepping, cooking, and cleaning.  She\u2019s also housing you.  She\u2019s saving you a ton of money.  If anything, you should be grateful she didn\u2019t ask for more.

I'd imagine even with every couple contributing \u00a330 your friend would still be out of pocket.

I think it's weird af to invite people over for 2 nights and 2 dinners and asking them to pay. It's weird as hell, but if everyone agrees, I guess it's fine. But that aside, if you're not going to be there for both days, you shouldn't pay what they are paying. Especially if the better of the 2 meals is the one missed. And don't listen to those people who are posting really aggressive AH verdicts. They have no real life perspective on this and are just saying you're cheap or whatever, but that's not true. You did nothing wrong and most people in your position would have assumed the same that the host is busy with the planning and the fact you won't be there both days slipped their mind.", "NTA. But it\u2019s always like this.

And you\u2019re supposed to just split it. It\u2019s a PITA. \n\nOne time it really worked out well though. One couple bought the groceries and did all the cooking and they were so efficient.

It cost ~$30, so I brought the receipt back and gave it to her. That night, she had one of my drinks, but stopped drinking after that, and told me not to worry about it.

On the 4th time, I told her that I really needed that money, because again, I was on disability, and didn\u2019t have any money to spare, and she finally told me that she would send it right now, but that where I had one of her drinks, she was going to send me a bit less. Even though she had said before that it was fine, I thought that was fair, so I said okay.

Two people are staying 2 nights, one person stays 1 night. Person a is using their card to pay, and is staying 2 nights, person b is also staying 2 nights, person c only one. Usually, if all were doing both nights, they'd each put in X amount, so the coat is split equally 3 ways, and person a would pay it. But they're not. So you gotta factor that in when telling each person how much they're sending over. The same thing applies, except the host, being person a in this context, for example, didn't do that. They just said \"right it was X amount, you all need to pay me Y\", without factoring in that person c, in this case OP, didn't \"stay 2 nights\" or in this case, have both meals. That's my opinion on it.", "The host is already heavily subsidising it. OP could, if they want to, tally up the costs of everything from that night including accommodation and once they realise it would be over \u00a3100 then they should just be quiet", "It\u2019s 12 people though.

Not ask if they can bring less than the minimum that was asked. \n\nOP just showed his friend he thinks all her efforts and costs are only worth 15.   Th\u00e9 host definitely lost money on this event.  OP is cheap.", "Not just someone else.

I doubt OP thanked her, brought the hostess flowers, a bottle of wine, or any other form of thanks.  His friend put a lot of effort into this for all of them.   OP comes across as so ungrateful for all the effort she put into this.", "I try to look at it a little less black and white. It's not necessarily paying for someone else's food on the day you missed. It's contributing to the funds / efforts the host has initiated.  Maybe your extra money wasn't for the food, but for the effort, for the cleaning, for the planning and organizing.", "How ungrateful are you when someone shows you hospitality? They\u2019re not paying for \u201csomeone else\u2019s\u201d food. \u00a330 for a night of free lodging, hanging with friends, having dinner be cooked for you and getting drinks is nothing to gripe about. Dear god, get a grip.", "With all her hospitality and the work she\u2019s putting in, \u00a315 is really not the hill to die on. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s spending more effort/money than her \u201cfair share\u201d because it\u2019s about the shared experience.

Then I have friends -also in NYC- who make much less than that and they live modest lives but are saving to buy a house and are set for retirement. Like, budgeting is a thing. You can do all those things but NOT simultaneously. 6 figures goes far EVERYWHERE, I will die on this hill.

When I was in my late teens and early 20s I probably wouldn't have cooked for that many people without having help from them. Now later in life I wouldn't have them pay to an event I plan.", "I mean, it's great if you can afford to offer to do that.  I've hosted tons of party/get togethers where I planned, paid, & made everything for 80+ people.  Its not cheap if you ask them to contribute a small amount.   The price ends up being less than $20pp in US dollars.   I think that's incredibly reasonable for TWO meals and pretty reasonable for ONE where someone is hosting you.  You would probably pay that if not more to go out to eat.  The host also probably took the cost of the meals & split 6 ways (per couple) & was done with it.  \n\nAlso, OP chose not to go the first night, its not like they were excluded.  OP has the right to ask, sure, but it's definitely cheapskatey and borderline AH (especially if you can afford it.  If money is tight, I feel that's to be considered).

Different situations.", "So you would rather have cheap food than to ask people to chip in for more expensive food? Okay. I guess you've also never been to a party where they asked for $5 to pay for a keg or other convenience. And if you ask people to go to a sporting event, do you pay for everyone's tickets and food at the event simply because you invited them? It's just weird that you're okay with paying for your own booze as long as you get to pick, but not for food and booze. 30 bucks for two nights lodging near London, including food and drink, and you think that's ballsy.

Because he's not even attending the thing he's being asked to pay for.", "This isn\u2019t the same though. The host isn\u2019t asking to be made whole and isn\u2019t charging everyone the full cost of cooking, cleaning, shopping, and all the groceries and drinks.

The host is asking folks chip in a little money to offset some of the overall expense and you respond by wanting to create more work for them and itemize everything down to the gram which\u2026 might actually work out to be *more* than what\u2019s being charged.\n\nA more reasonable comparison would be the host saying \u201cI rented the whole theater out for two showings and would appreciate if you could pay $30.\u201d And you\u2019re only going to one and asked to pay $15 instead\u2026. But the actual cost per person is $100.", "Not the same. Doesn't sound like they're being charged per plate of food. What if they eat more than everyone else. Is he going to offer to pay more?", "In your scenario, if they only pay for what they\u2019re going to see, who is covering the $15 that they\u2019re refusing to pay?

I don\u2019t really have a strong opinion either way, but growing up I was raised that if you\u2019re hosting an event, you don\u2019t ask for money. If you ask someone to come to an event you\u2019re hosting, you should be able ti cover the costs. Otherwise, you plan something as a group and everyone pitches in.

She\u2019s likely not breaking even money or effort wise of hosting 12 people, cleaning after them, they\u2019re using utilities, etc\u2026\n\nIf the price difference were greater, I\u2019d likely agree. But the context here is important to me", "No, the \u00a315 does not mean the same to them. \u00a315 means more on principle to the person who is offering up their home for lodging, doing the meal prep, he shopping, likely the cleanup after guests leave. OP nickel-and-diming for a measly \u00a315 for food seems ungrateful for all the other hospitality they are receiving.\n\nThe extra work to calculate out exactly how much money saved on OPs meal would be IMO too much to ask someone who is already doing so much for their guests.", "She wasn't upset about $15. She was upset someone valued $15 over her time, effort, and a shared experience.", "The host invited people for 2 nights and then calculated accordingly. It\u2019s not the hosts  responsibility if someone can only make it the second night to then readjust how much they are asking for. Like it or not, negotiating with friends over the difference of $10-$20 is being cheap. Especially for something like a long weekend away.  That\u2019s literally the price of a drink at a bar.", ">I've seen too many stories on here about people who are handed a bill after a meal, who were never told in advance that they were expected to pay, and that's beyond rude.\n\nIf you are referring to those posts where someone has been invited to a dinner at restaurant, I really dont understand it either that so many People  out there expect a free meal just because they were asked to join. I guess my country is just different. If someone asks someone to join for a restaurant dinner they fully expect to pay for their own food. Imo its beyond wild to even expect getting freebies, **unless spesifically told so In advance**.", "That's not what this chain is about.  They're saying asking for money from any of them is cheap", "Agreed, I think it's tacky to basically charge your guests a cover fee. Even when I was in my 20s and living cheaply I would not have demanded my guests pay to come to my party. But where I live, the potluck gathering is practically a way of life; the most I would ever do or have done is say, \"I'm making these things, additional sides are welcome, and please let me know about allergies or restrictions.\" It very well could be regional - around here, almost nobody thinks of showing up to a gathering without bringing a dish, beverages, desserts, snacks, whatever; at the very least, the first response to an invitation is \"what would you like me to bring?\" Heck, a friend of mine worked in the food industry, and many of her friends did likewise, so I stead of paying for catering, they did a potluck wedding feast (the friends who were tapped for this brought food in lieu of presents). It was awesome.\n\nOP, NTA.", "\"What do you want me to bring?\" Yourselves", "At 17 I threw a huge party for my friends at Halloween and I paid for everything! I told those that asked they could bring candy if they wanted and we could hand it out to the trick or treaters but I wouldn't asked for salt, let alone thirty bucks! Several came early to help and several others stayed late to help. But I would have been offended if any of them had tried to give me money. NTA", "I would like to know their age range to be honest. In my early twenties I would never have been able to afford something like this but now my friends and I all take turns and can afford to handle the expense within our means when it is our turn.", "My sister in law hosts Thanksgiving every year and it is very stressful for her. I told her we should do a potluck and every year my husband and I bring the main foods come early and help cook and clean up after.  It was great for her after that. I never mind a potluck.", "I can see your point of view on this.  I never ask for a hostess gift to be honest.  Just the time together. I also get that overnights are different but I would never expect them to pay a dime if invited them into my home. Though I have wonderful friends and whenever they have stayed they bring a bottle of wine or a treat for the home. To be fair I have a toddler so many times when they come to stay overnight they bring her a gift and that is fine by me though I always tell people that nothing is needed when they come. Again this was how I was raised so that is why I see it this way.", "You definitely get cheaper food than if you ask people to chip in a bit, but you claiming it's ballsy to ask people is the part that is ridiculous. It's not ballsy. It's actually quite normal. And I doubt you've ever invited 12 people to stay for two nights in your home.", "Are you implying that being tacky is the same thing as being an asshole? I would disagree heavily fashion can be tacky but dressing weird doesn't make somebody an asshole.\n\nNot breaking even is a literal expectation when you host a meal that's literally how it should be if you expect to make money or break even financially when you host a feeding event you literally shouldn't do it this is super simple this is why a lot of people don't have feasts.\n\nLiterally everything you mentioned are just expectations of hosting.\n\nThese are things that if she didn't expect to occur and couldn't afford then she shouldn't have hosted the idea of getting the friends together I'm sure is appreciated by everyone but if $15 is going to make her break her to the point where she has to guilt or shame her friends over it then she really shouldn't be having this event. \n\nIt literally doesn't matter about the price again her friends said I don't really want to and had a perfectly valid reason she disrespected that and then she tried to guilt them and shame them.\n\nThe price is completely irrelevant", "Dude, the other guy literally made a remark first. Guy basically said that no one likes around or inviting you out. He got pissy first.", "[deleted]", "According to OP\u2019s previous post he\u2019s 33, so I\u2019d assume the friends are early to mid 30s.\n\nI\u2019m in that same age range and don\u2019t ask others to chip in when I host, and I have hosted people at my home for entire weekends.", "I don\u2019t think it much matters what their ages are when OP admits they don\u2019t think the difference between what they asked to pay and what they hoped to pay \u201cisn't that much.\u201d Clearly their friend thought covering all herself was too much, and OP admits what she asked for wasn\u2019t too much. It doesn\u2019t really matter if they\u2019re all 20 or all 40; the host could be a struggling actor while all the friends are bankers, or the other way around. None of that matters if we know for a fact what OP can afford and have a pretty good idea what the friend can afford. Even if they we all waiters, tbh 30 GBP for two dinners with friends is a frigging bargain.", "I don\u2019t ask for hostess gifts or for people to pay for meals in my home either. But it\u2019s just poor manners to go to someone\u2019s home empty handed, especially for an overnight visit. If someone did that to me without a really good reason (ie they\u2019re struggling financially) I would think hard before inviting them again. OP balked at paying a extra 15 pounds split between 2 people. He is cheap AF. The host shouldn\u2019t have even had to ask people to pitch in for their stay. They should have offered as good guests. If they had decided to eat out that night, he would have been out far more than 7.50 per person.", "So you are expecting a host to be doing math problems and sending invoices? What if someone didn\u2019t drink or was a vegan?", "Or\u2026maybe just don\u2019t include the guests who expect you to do these mental gymnastics on top of hosting and feeding everyone?", "No. Read the first paragraph according to OP. They were invited for the weekend. During this weekend the host planned 2 meals and ASKED every couple to contribute \u00a330 to help. So nothing your saying is correct\u2026*edit*\u2026 besides your last sentence. That\u2019s might be correct. *edit*", "First of all, tacky can have different connotations so that\u2019s kinda irrelevant. \n\nIf you can\u2019t recognize nuance between different situations then I\u2019m not really sure how to proceed in this conversation \n\nIf guests were all this nitpicky, nobody would host when hosts already do so much to accommodate them and foster a great memory. \n\nLook, I understand the principle of paying proportionally. I just think this is quite a ridiculous hill to die on.", "I think you're the only person who noticed. Thanks for saying something. I hope you're having a wonderful day!", "Awwe, someone's not having a good day?", "They were making a point that acting like that means people will stop inviting him. That's not making a remark, it's something that genuinely happens", "Yeah, but ***that person*** was saying that in response to someone saying asking for any money would be cheap at life stages.  That's the context of their comment.  \n\nYou can't claim context for your own post while ignoring context of the one you replied to.", "Same. The only way I would have is if they invited themselves.", "I agree it is a bargain but again. Why should op pay for one of the dinners that they won't be eating.", "What if I helped with the dishes? Do I get a credit? Lol.", "\"She asked if we could pay \u00a330 to continue towards food and booze\". I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that you only pay for what you're going to eat.", "I'm having a great day.  Thanks for checking in.  \nI'm sorry you're getting so worked up about opinions.  \ud83d\udc9c", "What silver's doing is being dramatic. His friends will all leave him because he doesn't want to pay for their food when he won't be there. With that being said, I'm probably gonna order takeout in a little bit. Would you be able to cash app me 15$? It's only a couple of bucks.", "And if I were the host, I wouldn\u2019t want to invite you or OP to more events if that thought process became habitual. Then I\u2019d actual change my answer to AH because of how selfish that thought process is."]}
