There were 12 of us in total, mostly couples, all fairly close mates. She planned a big meal for both the Friday and Saturday night.

I think she asked for \u00a330 from each couple.\n\nThe problem is, my girlfriend and I were only available to come for the Saturday night (I let my friend know a few weeks in advance). I messaged the friend privately and said something like 'heya, so as we're only staying for 1 night, would you want a bit less money from us? :) ' (hoping that \u00a315 would be more accurate). My thought was she'd simply forgotten to calculate for us/forgot we weren't gonna be there for the Friday evening meal and drinks. But her reply was along the lines of 'wow, that's cheeky guys... I mean, I guess you could pay less...'. But now it was very awkward and we simply paid the full amount. It's left a lingering tone since, but we're still friends.\n\nGranted, \u00a330 isn't that much and she did put a lot of effort in to go out and get the food and drink... but whilst everyone was enjoying a big meal together on the Friday night, we were at home having leftovers and juice infront of the TV (we had to be home for saturday morning before you ask...).", "created_utc": 1687111608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cqwm2/aita_for_not_paying_in_full/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is so cheap and tacky. It\u2019s not like you could have one night out drinking and having dinner for 2 on that price and you asked to pay less. Does your girlfriend know you did this? I would be mortified.  Keep in mind this woman is also shopping and cooking for you, prepping the house and probably cleaning up after all the guests.", "YTA for being so incredibly cheap. Try finding new accommodations with that extra 15 you save.", "YTA\u2026 so lame and cheap.. causing problems for 15 pounds.. wich probably isnt covering the cost of food and drink for 2 people anyway.. I would be embarassed", "Unless you are totally broke I don't understand why you asked in the first place. Your friend who organized everything shouldn't have to account for everything if the amount is that negligible.\n\nSo yes YTA", "NAH it\u2019s a super cheap thing to do, but you did it and she agreed. Sometimes dignity is worth more than \u00a330, dude!", "NTA you shouldn't have to pay for time you aren't there plain and simple doesn't matter if it were 15 pounds or 150 pounds. If you were going away with friends and only were going for 1 night would you pay for 2 nights lodging no why not because you aren't there 2 nights. She was being a bad host charging everyone the same price whether anyyone was going for both nights or just one.", "YTA\n\u00a330, seriously?", "Just to add: if the roles were reversed I think I\u2019d be totally fine, and be like \u2018ah shit that makes complete sense. Just chuck me a bit less! \ud83d\ude42\u2019\n\nInteresting seeing the different responses here. Proves nothing is simple in life! \ud83d\ude05", "NTA\n\nYou didn't agree with the calculations... you asked privately without making a scene. You're fine.", "I would say NAH bc you ended up just paying. 30 is a low amount for 2 people if you ask me and Im not well off. They are probably paying for things out of pocket anyway. If the amount was a lot higher Id feel differently.", "NTA. You were there for half the time so I would expect you to pay less. As long as it was known in advance.\n\nAlso note that the \"lingering tone\" might all be in your head. If it bothers you, talk to your friend about it before you let it ruin your friendship.", "NAH. Honestly,  if it were me, I wouldn't have gone either night. Why should I be expected to pay for both nights when I could only attend one night? It wasn't unreasonable to only pay towards the one night  you could attend. Next time, just say you have prior commitments and you'll attend the next gathering.", "You were at fault! Her asking for contribution is not her demanding you to pay for your meal, it's actually asking for help to have a successful weekend. Fortunately you paid the \u00a330 so NAH. Glad your friendship wasn't hurt, still it would be even better if you talk it out, not necessarly apologize but let her know you aknowledge your mistake.", "YTA. It was only \u00a315 from each person, which is not a lot for a day of food and drink.", "NTA,\n\nDon\u2019t get your friend, the money is for 2 meals. You weren\u2019t going to be there for one so why should you pay for the one you weren\u2019t going to attend? Nothing cheeky about it.  Your friend is being unreasonable. Granted it\u2019s only 30 so it ain\u2019t much, but I would do the same", "NTA. It would be logical to only pay half the price. This was known well in advance, and totally not a suprise.   \n\n\nThis would be different when it was last minute, but this was not the case here.", "INFO: When did you let your friend know that you couldn\u2019t make the second dinner? How much notice did they give? \n\nIf they gave you time and you last minute said sorry can\u2019t make it, I would say y t a for not explaining sooner because they probably already bought/planned out food for you. They might have too much food where some might even go to waste.\n\nBut if they didn\u2019t give you time or bought the food without confirming your RSVP then I would say N T A. They should have gotten a head count with time to assess their spending.", "NTA while \u00a330 isn't alot per couple, if I was organsing I would have calculated it per person for each of the nights depending on who was going to be there. If I was attending I would bring a gift for the person who organised it. Total bug bear of mine things like this, it isn't fair paying the same as everyone else when you aren't getting the full benefit", "NTA - You paid in full even though it made no sense. That would leave a bad taste in my mouth as well and I would absolutely judge your friend for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For \u00a315 difference, it isn\u2019t worth it to make it socially awkward.  You are getting a free place to crash and this what you thought was important? If I was her, I\u2019d likely not invite you the next time.", "YTA", "Thought I was on r/trashtaste for a second", "YTA. She not only went out to multiple stores, she used her spices, gas, water, dishes, electricity,ice to prepare a wonderful meal. I\u2019m sure you were the topic of conversation. I wonder did you make sure you ate, drank 30 dollars worth of food.", "Let me guess, when you go out with your friends and it's decided to split the bill. You look through the menu working out who had the most expensive dessert or an extra glass of wine.", "YTA\u2026 for starters, its \u00a315.\n\nSecondly, she spent all the time planning this, which involves a lot of calculations. When suddenly one party says \u201coh we\u2019re only there for half the time, therefore we\u2019re only paying half\u201d\u2026 that either changes the calculated amount for everyone else in the group after she\u2019s already done all the calculations and had people agree to it, forces her to alter buying plans last minute to accommodate (most of which would already be in motion), or take that amount out of her own pocket.\n\nAny way you cut it\u2026 big time YTA", "everyone here is calling you an asshole and cheap \u2013 and maybe it is cheap if you\u2019re well-off \u2013 but me and my friends are mostly all very low-income, and i have definitely calculated costs of food differently for friends who weren\u2019t able to attend the whole weekend trip. when you\u2019re living hand to mouth, even \u00a330 is a lot if you get nothing out of it. in my opinion, NTA", "I have a different take.  When I plan to host and have meals planned, I go into it that I\u2019m paying for everything. That\u2019s part of hosting parties.  You can always say these are the drinks I\u2019m providing, but feel free to bring an alternative if you don\u2019t like these options.  But I don\u2019t ask for money.  I just couldn\u2019t imagine for billing people for a party I want to throw.", "NTA.", "YTA this is coming across cheap and from your friend's comments I suspect you and your girlfriend are big drinkers, which is why she's shocked you're querying the cost.", "They spent \u00a3180 on food and drink for 2 days? I reckon she made a profit", "I think this is the least destructive option I should have taken.", " Sometimes dignity is worth more than \u00a330, dude!", "So my reasoning for messaging her was I simply thought she forgot to account for me arriving a day later..\n\nAlso\u2026 \u2018Much\u2019 is subjective of course. \u00a315 could be a big difference for some people (ok fine, for me it\u2019s not massive).", "Tbh, I don\u2019t actually think I suggested \u00a315 exactly. Just \u2018a bit less\u2019. Not sure that makes your point stronger or weaker though", "I actually don\u2019t think you\u2019re at fault at all. I have organized many big group weekends and only charged the people for the nights/food/etc that they were there. It\u2019s not that hard to figure out and it makes it fair.", "I think what made it trickier is that the request for money was on a group chat with all attendees. She\u2019d have had to contact me separately for the lower amount. But still\u2026", "I couldn\u2019t make the first night, not the second. And I let her know a couple of weeks in advance.", "lol", "Yea, financially I\u2019m doing well so I don\u2019t see it as a lot. It\u2019s not like. SUPER rude to ask to pay for half but, just a little bit \u2026", "She should give you an invoice for the free place to stay or just not invite you the next time everyone is going.", "Oh whoops! Thanks for explaining. You gave her plenty of time. NTA. You were polite to pay as well.", "at the same time you ARE the guests and you did get invited over so, maybe it\u2019s rude of her for asking for you to pay for the food \ud83e\udd14", "Nah I think it\u2019d be unfair to expect her to pay for food for all 12 of us. Also I\u2019m sure the contributions didn\u2019t cover the full cost exactly."]}
