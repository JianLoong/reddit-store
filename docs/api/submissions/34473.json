She met Eva as in school and they were inseparable with Eva letting my wife stay over a lot as well as providing a constant source of support. I met my wife at University. Unfortunately, Eva died suddenly a year into our relationship. I had met her a few times, and she was lovely. My wife was understandably devastated. Two years ago, we married and she took my last name, Brown.\n\nOur baby girl is due in the spring and understandably, my wife wants to honour Eva in her name. This is something that she has said throughout the relationship. I was happy with the idea of honouring her, and we have discussed baby names throughout the relationship and pregnancy. The leading name we were tossing about was a place name that had significant memories to them.\n\nYesterday she came up to me and said that she had a dream about Eva asking her to \"remember her by her name\" (she had some like this around the time Eva died but none recently to my knowledge), and to memorialise her, our baby must be called Eva. I said absolutely no way. She said why not, and I reminded her of the historical figure, Eva Braun (pronounced Brown), wife of probably one of history's most evil figures and reassured her that we will tell our kids about Aunt Eva, and she'll always be remembered, but my wife refused saying it has to be her name. She says few will make the link to the historical character, and she won't be bullied at school.\n\nShe said she had fell out with the place name, and a family member has had a baby recently with a similar name (think Brooke to Brooklyn). I suggested things to do with Eva, such as her birthstone or honouring her through a middle name, or even names that had Eve/Eva in. Anything but Eva itself. \n\nShe started crying and said that she won't name the baby anything else, and it's the ultimate way Eva can live on. I said it's a shitty situation, and if we had literally any other surname we would, but I literally can't. Not only am I extremely morally opposed, I work in a field where if there was wind that I named my child Eva Brown, my work could be at risk. She's saying I'm making excuses, and not supporting her as she is putting in a lot of effort to having this baby. This resulted in a fight and now I am on the couch for the second night now.\n\nSome of our friends are saying I'm being dramatic but my sister (the mother of \"Brooke\") is telling me that if she continues to register the baby without her. To be honest, I'm leaning that way if she continues not to compromise. I'm really not sure what to do.

I understand not wanting your daughter to have a similar name to a Nazi but I think you\u2019re overthinking it. Brown and Braun are pronounced differently in English. Eva/Ava is one of the most popular baby names these days and Brown is a very common surname. I\u2019m not sure how naming your daughter Eva Brown would put your work at risk.

No childhood/raising her/ no structure. We\u2019re no contact now that I\u2019m an adult.", "I was named after my dad's grandmother. She died when I was 7 so I did actually see her on holidays & stuff.\n\nThe fact that OP's wife is saying it's a way for Eva to live on I think is troubling.", "All my kids bear part of their names in memory of at least one departed family member too, and if they're reincarnated anything, it's monkeys and goats...", "I was named after my great-grandma and she had Bipolar Disorder (obviously back then it was called something different but it was clearly bipolar, she was institutionalized and everything). I have Bipolar Disorder, whereas my sister doesn't have any mental illnesses and neither of my parents have bipolar. I fully know that this isn't how anything works but I've poked at my parents many times by telling them that they caused me to have this illness by naming me after her \ud83d\ude02", "In my opinion naming your kid Tito Benito is an much, much better choice than Eva Brown. My mind didn't immediately jump to the two dictators,  it sounds a lot nicer and kinda cute. \n\nWhen I googled Tito Benito nothing showed up for either Tito or Benito Mussolini , just normal people .\n\nWhen I googled Eva Brown Google immediately corrected me and searched for Eva Braun, even if you let Google only search for Eva Brown you still get all the results for Eva Braun because some people misspelled her Brown and stuff like that.\n\nSo yeah Tito Benito is not an great name but could fly under the radar, Eva Brown there is no chance people won't find out, so it's an far worse choice name wise.", "Hahaha!", "I was gonna go with Adolf as my joke but ITA.", "He also said registering the name. In the US it would be filling out the birth certificate. I figured they were likely European.", "OK, this is what tips it to NTA for me. I was sitting here thinking, \"Yeah, the last names are similar, but I don't think they're similar enough to be an issue.\" But knowing that \"Braun\" is basically pronounced as \"Brown\" in German makes it literally the same name. If I were OP, I wouldn't want to name my kid \"Eva\" either...", "This is also something I didn't know, so thank you for this. Any time I'd heard someone pronounce the name it was always like brawn, so that's just what it became in my head. But when you put 'au' my mind immediately thought 'ow'. Tbf, my brain is really bad at connecting things I should know.", "You can call a pregnant woman unreasonable... just not to their face", "The historical name connection would cross my mind but I personally wouldn't view it as a red flag since Eve/Eva are common first names and Brown is such a common last name (now if the last name was Braun, then I would raise eyebrows). Plus, there's 300+ \"Eva Brown\"s on LinkedIn. I can't imagine they all have neo-Nazi parents.\n\nThat said, I would go with Eve over Eva.\n\nCompromise 2: Use your wife\u2019s maiden name as the child\u2019s surname or opt for a hyphenated surname.", "I\u2019m sorry but the fact that \u201cDi\u201d means 2 makes it so much worse. they literally named her Ann the second", "Wait\u2026so all these years, I\u2019ve been using a BROWN electric shaver???", "I had the exact same reaction. Like yes, everyone, *everyone* will make the connection. By 4th grade at the latest her classmates will ALL be wise to it and the real torture will kick in.", "Same here. As soon as I saw his surname is Brown, I said hell no to that name.  Eve/Eva could be a middle name.    \n\n\nOP, ask your wife if Eva had a middle name you could use.", "Same. I saw the surname and said \"ohhhhhhh\" out loud.", "I kind of did a shocked laugh as soon as I saw the surname Brown, it took me by surprise for sure", "Except he's a *history* teacher. Yikes.", "Is that actually a thing many people are aware of outside neonazi and social justice twitter? I have a vague recollection of maybe hearing about it second hand through screenshots, but I'd never see someone using a common emoji or hand sign and assume they're a neonazi. Unless it's extremely outside a context it would make sense in, I'd think they're just saying \"okay\". I know the clown emoji was briefly \"claimed\" by neonazis on twitter but that blew over quickly when most people just... didn't stop using it. \n\nFeel free to correct me if it is genuinely something well known outside certain online circles. Could just be regional or not relevant on the particular social media platforms I use.", "That's horrible. I'm so sorry you had to go through that.", "Parentification. Look that up, that\u2019s the name for exactly what you described. \u2639\ufe0f", "Yes, Im a history teacher too, and this name would be massively problematic.  His wife wanting to remember her friend doesn\u2019t offset the following problems that the name will cause.\n1) Being incredibly insensitive to Holocaust survivors\n2) The child being endlessly tormented and probably have issues finding a job.\n3) Many people will automatically assume the child\u2019s parents are closeted Nazis.\n4) The OP could very likely lose his career because his colleagues will assume he\u2019s a closeted Nazi.", "Yes but it's too subtle for monolingual English speakers to even hear much less understand. English is a language of broad imprecise sounds. My American husband was literally teasing me today about what I sound like teaching our son the difference between French vowels. \"It's 'ehhh' not 'ehhh'!\" (That's a direct quote as best as I can remember it.) He compared it to when I try to teach him to read a cat's facial expressions. He says they don't have them since their faces literally can't move. This was all in good fun & he's very happy I'm teaching our child French and acknowledges me as the expert on cats...\n\nAll I'm really saying is, it all sounds the same to them. They literally can't tell.", "I'm not planning to change my surname but my partner and I refer to our little family (us + 2 cats) with the surname of a famous painter, as that's linked with our love story. It's a nice coincidence, it's his favourite painter, I once did a drawing + presentation of said painter in high school, and I used to write down sweet things my partner would say on a notebook with said painter's art as cover. \n\n\nAll this was a coincidence, so for us it was a rather easy pick. Maybe something like that too, fortuitous coincidences linked to happy memories?", "I dunno, my 4th grade kid asked me today who Hitler was (it came up watching TV). Clearly I need to supplement his history education.\n\nBut yeah, definitely don't name your kid Eva.", "Exactly. Their daughter would be bullied mercilessley with a name like that.", "The adults will be aware well before that and will have tagged her within the school system as a red flag to watch well before then.", "Oh, I know. She was told she was doing that. Knowing didn\u2019t change much, but it has helped me heal now that I\u2019m away from her."]}
