My husband (31m) has always been super fond of nicknames and has given me plenty of them. They constantly change and I have never minded any of the ones he\u2019s given me before. They\u2019re all quite harmless, usually food or animal related. But they tend to stick for a while. \n\n  His family also uses nicknames. They occasionally give me one, too, it\u2019s often the same one my husband uses if it isn\u2019t too sappy. Again, I don\u2019t mind them, in fact I usually find it quite cute and endearing. Until recently. \n\n  My husband started calling me Lulu - let me give you the context. I was called Lulu growing up exclusively by my mother, and she\u2019s passed away not long before I met my husband. I took her loss pretty hard. I told him that it has a lot of emotional significance for me, and that it doesn\u2019t feel right to hear anyone else say it. He respected that for years, and so did his family. \n\n  But recently his sister has been referring to me as Lulu whenever I wasn\u2019t there, according to what I\u2019ve been told. And I guess he naturally picked up on it. It\u2019s irritating because it\u2019s not like he forgot about my reasons behind it, he\u2019ll hesitate before saying it. Like he\u2019s trying to see how I\u2019ll react. I\u2019ve reminded him calmly a couple times that I would appreciate he not call me that. There\u2019s plenty of other things I didn\u2019t mind him calling me. Nothing that had emotional weight. \n\n  The other day he said that he didn\u2019t see the big deal anymore. It had been some years and I should be over it by now. That it\u2019s just a nickname. He said it lightly, like he was trying to let me down easy, but it stung.\n\nMaybe I overreacted, but I was hurt by it. I packed a bag and I\u2019m currently staying with my sister. He and his family texted saying I\u2019m doing a lot over a little nickname, and I\u2019m thinking maybe they\u2019re right. I want to get past this because it feels petty at this point.

He has chosen to disregard your boundary and denigrate your ongoing grief over your mother. \n\nHe chose the actions, you're choosing the consequences. \n\nIs your reaction extreme? Maybe, but if this is the hill you're choosing to die on, stand firm. I bet his family remembers your boundary on this issue going forward.", "NTA - you get to choose what name you want to be called by, end of story. People who knowingly refuse to call you by the name you choose, are failing to show the most basic level of respect one person should show another. If it's \"no big deal\", then it's no big deal for them to call you by the right name. They don't get to choose your name for you. The reason is irrelevant - your feelings are enough, and clearly they feel their \"right\" to call you whatever is more important than how you feel, and that's messed up.", "NTA. It's not a big deal *to him*. It is to you. Tell him that. Your mother will always remain your mother, no matter how much time has passed.

Or at this point are they doing it on purpose?", "NTA. It's not just over the nickname. It's that you communicated that out of all the ones he'd picked/his family had done, this one was in the no fly zone and they all opted to dig their heels in and double down and call you Lulu, then demand you get over it because 'it's been enough time'. Whether your mother passed a year ago or twenty, it's up to you how long you want to grieve and how you manage not having her. \n\nHe knows exactly why you're not okay with it and he's minimizing it. Him and his family saying you're overreacting and being upset over a nickname are missing the bigger picture. It's a memory that you don't want to be painfully reminded of because you're not ready for it. And if he loved you, he'd be horrified that he was causing you emotional distress. Tell him that.

It's not a joke if it's not funny. Then his family proceeds to diminish your feelings over it.

But even if it were some stupid thing (which isn\u2019t by any means), whenever it\u2019s a big deal for you, it means he should at least consider and respect that. So no, you\u2019re not overreacting imo.", "NTA. \n\nEven if your mother hadn't passed away, someone should respect the name(s) you've told them they can/can't use for you. It's basic decency.", "NTA you have a right to be upset. Thats something they can learn to respect honestly", "NTA if they need a nickname for you, and there are better options, they can use one you are okay with.

Did he tell you why he won\u2019t respect your preference?", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to accept any nickname you don't like.\n\nBut this isn't merely a nickname you don't care for.  It's sentimental, reminding you of your mother, and how you lost her. There will always be some things in your life that are tinged with nostalgia for her.  And it seems that the nickname \"Lulu\" is one of those things.\n\nIt's a little bit of a red flag that your husband thinks he can dictate a timeline for missing your late mother, or what forms of nostalgia for her are appropriate.\n\nIt doesn't mean that you aren't \"over it\" with losing her, which is a nonsensical thing, anyways.  She'll always be a part of your life and memories.  Just as a new spouse needs to respect the memory and legacy of the first spouse, if they marry someone whose spouse has died, a spouse also needs to respect the memory and legacy of others that their partner may have lost - a parent, a sibling, a child, a grandparent, etc. \n\nTell him that the nickname \"Lulu,\" while lovely, for you has a strong connection to your late mother, and it makes you feel sentimental and miss her when people use it, and you'd like to keep it special for your mother and your memories of her.  When the time comes, and he loses people he cares for (hopefully only in the distant future) you hope you will be able to support him and respect their legacy, just like you need him to do for you, with this nickname and the associations with your mother.", "NTA. My mother is also deceased and I loved her very much too. If I had an association like this that someone was intentionally ignoring, I would pack a bag and leave the space too. These can be very big feelings.\n\nAlso, what does it hurt them to use other nicknames? What earthly reason could they have for ignoring your preference, other than some weird power play/sadism?\n\nI'm so sorry this is being done by people you normally trust.\n\nEdit: also, \"you should be over it\"??? Complete asshole comment. You are never \"over\" the death of a parent or child. Your life goes on, your mourning changes and gets much less intense, you're fine, but you're not \"over\" a loss like that - such a disrespectful way to talk about a major loss. People can be happy and functional and fine and they still don't have to be \"over\" a major loss - the person lost is still a major part of their life.", "Nta HIM AND HIS FAMILY are doing a lot over a nickname.

I've actually been in this exact situation before. My grandpa, who passed when I was little used to call me Reggie, because apparently the shortened version of Regina (Gina, which I exclusively go by) just didn't work for him, lol. No one else is allowed to call me Reggie, aside from one family friend who ONLY calls me Reggie since I've never had the heart to explain the reason it's not my fav, and he seems to enjoy it. No one has EVER had a problem when I've told them I'd prefer not to be called that, and explain why. \n\nLike someone else mentioned, it's not about the nickname, it's about the respect.

He has NO RIGHT to disrespect you. Call him a prick head as your new nickname for him and see how he likes it, and do it around family\u2026 additionally- I would also think up some choice nicknames for them too! Your NOT THE ASS!

That is a horrific thing to say to someone who has lost a parent. The fact that he didn\u2019t put his foot down with his family calling you that is disgusting. He has been repeatedly disrespectful towards a very easy boundary. \n\nI\u2019m sorry OP, you guys need to have a serious talk. You are in no way overreacting.

The fact it isn't a big deal to your husband but is for you clearly shows he and his family don't respect the boundaries you've set in place. This is an issue of communication and respect. I would have left as well.", "NTA. I can see where people are coming from saying you overreacted, but you\u2019ve asked him multiple times and you\u2019ve given a perfectly understandable reason for the request.\n\nI lost my dad when I was 19 and he was everything to me. He called me Lassie and if anyone tried to use that nickname for me who didn\u2019t know, they would get 1 warning and then I\u2019d be gone. If they already knew, they wouldn\u2019t even get a goodbye.\n\nIf you can talk to your husband again, tell him that you\u2019ve told him about this boundary already and that this is how seriously you take it. If you are willing to give him another chance, you could tell him he has been warned and that this is a make or break issue for you. It would be for me.", "NTA, this shows some serious disrespect for you, the situation, and your emotions. I can see how this could be so important to you that you needed the space. For me, I wouldn't have left but gotten instantly petty. They think nicknames are no big deal then they all now have new nicknames. Evil grin", "NTA. You set a boundary and everyone is ignoring it. And I think some people see it as an overreaction, but maybe it\u2019s time to over react. Being calm about it isn\u2019t working anymore. Also why is it that everyone\u2019s family is so nosy when it comes to these things? Like mind your business and respect OP.", "NTA.  Fun that they don't want to consider your feelings over this nickname.  Interesting that this is the nickname he's decided on now, even though he knows you don't want it.   this is all very deliberate.", "NTA names matter and they called you something that hurt you repeatedly.", "NTA.

If your husband wants you stay he knows what he needs to do.", "If its not a big deal & only a \u2018little nickname\u2019, then they should be happy to drop it. NTA. Its the one boundary you have imposed. Its not a big to uphold but it is significant & shows respect.", "Nta", "It's totally your call re the nickname. I am surprised your husband did not stick up for you with the sister. It is not his call about you \"getting over it.\"  He did not even know your mom.

His family is very much disrespecting you by calling you a name you *explicitly* said not to call you by- on top of him saying it\u2019s been \u201clong enough and you should be over it\u201d- that was rude as hell. \n\nI do think packing your bags is a little bit of an overreaction, however temporarily removing yourself from a situation that upset you is smart, because arguing while emotional never ends well. \n\nI think the two of you need to sit down and talk about boundaries, especially about what the rest of the family calls you. They should\u2019ve stopped using the nickname the second you asked- regardless of reason. \n\nMaybe say you realize you overreacted but that that name hurts to hear and him and his family using it, especially after you asked them not to, is rude and hurting you. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should apologize, as he\u2019s the one wrong here, but agreeing that maybe you overreacted and discussing how it hurts you should help.", "NTA - people should call you what you want to be called. Simple as that. It's one thing if it's a joke and you're joking about getting annoyed by it, but clearly this nickname holds emotional baggage for you. Even if it didn't it's still incredibly rude to repeatedly call someone by a nickname they have said they do not like.", "Husband: I'm going to try out numerous names until I find out the one that hurts you, then I will insist on using it. \n\nAlso husband: What's the big deal? I only went out of my way to figure out how to hurt you.", "NTA. I have a nickname from my grandpa. One uncle is allowed to call me it\u2026 one cousin trained once. He got a black eye after trying a second time.", "NTA although moving may have been a bit much. I probably would have started by not responding to it since it's not my name.", "NTA\n\nHe discounted your feelings. No cool.", "NTA. The bigger question is why are THEY making such a big deal out of a nickname? It's not a big deal; right? They should just pick another, then. \n\nI have never understood why people would want to force something on you that you're clearly uncomfortable with and that they are gaining absolutely nothing from. To me, though, the issue here is the complete disregard for the emotional impact of your mom's death. \n\nThe time since your mom's death is irrelevant. It is about the time you spent WITH her when she used this nickname. I personally can't imagine ever feeling differently about my mom's death. I'm through the five stages of grief, sure, but that doesn't mean I don't still tear up and get a pit in my stomach when I think about her, or how she would have loved this, or how unfair it is that she's not here. Literally tearing up now. \n\nI have videos of my mom, of course, and to hear her say a phrase in those videos that I've heard her say so many times before would be SUCH a big deal. I imagine if you could hear (or maybe you do have voicemails or videos of her) your mom saying \"Lulu,\" it might even bring you to tears. \n\nTo hear someone else say this name is a stab at that place in you because you're ALWAYS going to think of your mom, and you wish you could hear your mom say it, and instead these randos are using it for ... what? So you just get an emotional slap in the face every time they say it because it is inextricably linked to emotions and memories of your mom. \n\nMy mom has a not-so-common name, so whenever I do meet someone with it or someone mentions someone else with her name, it is an emotional slap in the face for me. Not on purpose by them, but I have to then deal with all of the emotions that come with that. Why do they want to force that experience on you?", "As much as I think sleeping away is an overreaction, (assuming it's only because of the nickname thing, and nothing else underlying), I think you're well within your right to feel mad and hurt by it. It's completely valid to feel betrayed when someone you love and respect, does not respect your boundaries.\n\nAnd that line \"you should be over it by now\" is incredible.", "He's sure wanting to hurt you a lot over a nickname he could easily drop.  \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nPeople always gave me nicknames growing up. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m pretty ambivalent to it. But this isn\u2019t about nicknames, it\u2019s about respect.

I wouldn't be saying ESH here if OP would have just yelled at him or his family or anything like that.

I was called Lulu growing up exclusively by my mother, and she\u2019s passed away not long before I met my husband. I took her loss pretty hard. I told him that it has a lot of emotional significance for me, and that it doesn\u2019t feel right to hear anyone else say it. He respected that for years, and so did his family. \n\n  But recently his sister has been referring to me as Lulu whenever I wasn\u2019t there, according to what I\u2019ve been told. And I guess he naturally picked up on it. It\u2019s irritating because it\u2019s not like he forgot about my reasons behind it, he\u2019ll hesitate before saying it. Like he\u2019s trying to see how I\u2019ll react. I\u2019ve reminded him calmly a couple times that I would appreciate he not call me that. There\u2019s plenty of other things I didn\u2019t mind him calling me. Nothing that had emotional weight. \n\n  The other day he said that he didn\u2019t see the big deal anymore. It had been some years and I should be over it by now. That it\u2019s just a nickname. He said it lightly, like he was trying to let me down easy, but it stung.\n\nMaybe I overreacted, but I was hurt by it. I packed a bag and I\u2019m currently staying with my sister. He and his family texted saying I\u2019m doing a lot over a little nickname, and I\u2019m thinking maybe they\u2019re right. I want to get past this because it feels petty at this point.

The nickname given to you by your Mother is exclusive to your relationship with her. The fact that she is dead makes this more, not less, significant to you. \n\n\nFor your husband to repeatedly challenge that boundary, knowing it upsets you, is BAD.

If one of their kids had a special, private nickname, something just between the two of them, do they think it might hurt for someone else to use that nickname casually after their child died? Would they be upset if that person refused to drop it after being told not to call them that?   Is it something they would just 'get over' because it isn't a big deal to the person using that nickname ?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe needs to take a good look at why he is doing this.

I knew someone who hated being called lovely, or dear, or anything other than her name at work. It took me a few days but whenever I called her anything but her name, I apologised immediately after realizing. \nYou are not the asshole - especially if it's a emotional reason.

If someone called me the pet name my mom has given me since I learnt to run/walk at 9/10 mos. old and someone called me it besides her, I would first ask them not to and lay down my boundaries, and they cannot respect it; it seems like his sister needs a reminder too. I would talk to your husband\u2019s family again, and if they cannot accept a simple boundary and keep up this type of boundary or any other rational one. It doesn\u2019t seem bad enough for divorce but some counselling may do you both some good!", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to have a valid reason to reject a nickname, but it\u2019s especially upsetting that he disregards what the name means to you. \n\nThere are plenty of other nicknames for Lucy, Luce, Lucy Goosey, Cece, etc. It shouldn\u2019t be that hard to find an alternative.", "*\u201cThe other day he said that he didn\u2019t see the big deal anymore.\u201d*\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get to decide that.

To be clear - **You\u2019re bf is okay hurting you because *he* doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s hurtful**. The audacity. OP This is a signal of a larger personality issue that you really need to acknowledge. His perceptions trumps yours and that will manifest itself in different ways, some subtle and some more obvious. The subtle ones are the ones you really need to pay attention to.

It's not because it's a little thing. It's because you are not allowed to be a real person with your own emotions and history. You know they've had conversations about this behind you back and they are egging your husband on.  Honestly if they can't let this go, I'd be very wary about what the next thing is that \"shouldn't be that big a deal.\"  Financial abuse? Isolation?

No thank you.\n\nHow dare his family tell you that it's a \"little nickname\" and that you shouldn't react with pain (and avoidance as in staying with your sister) that your husband who is supposed to love and support you is using it and endorsing his family's using it?\n\nThe problem here isn't you, it's your husband.  He knows it hurts you; he does it anyway.  How hard would it be to call you something other than Lulu?  I mean, it's not exactly a challenge.\n\nI would suggest that you get the two of you into couples counseling immediately.

I had a pair of socks I liked go missing while I was living at home. Somehow it ended up in my father's drawer and he started wearing them. He was sick at that time, and he never got better. When he died I took them back and I barely wear them because I don't want them to wear out. But I'll probably never throw them away and if I meet someone I want to spend my life with they're gonna have to understand that.
