Whatever happens, always know that your actions were a perfectly reasonable response to Grandma's intrusion.\n2. Were things fine between you and your mom before Grandma's arrival, or has your mom always treated you as a burden, a stress in her life/ expected you to defer to her and everyone else's wishes?\n3. Will raising the possibility of grandma having dementia make your mom more frustrated with you or redirect her thinking to considering that possibility? (If Mom reacts badly to the idea, you may want to back off even if that is a real possibility. Just so it's not more reason for you mom to want you out.)\n4. Can you (tape record) and ask grandma some questions? \"*Grandma, that lock makes it easy for you to remember not to come into my room. We ask you not to go into my room; why do you still come in or want to come in? What about my room do you feel is not 'cleaned up'? If I agreed to keep these (4) things put up, would you agree to stop coming into my room? You have a room and the whole rest of the house.

Why is it so important to you to rearrange the things in my room?*\" Whatever questions you feel might get at why grandma wants/needs to keep invading/revising your room.", "NTA.  I am a grandmother, and would never go into my older grandson's room when I visit their home without specific permission.  My younger grandson (15) lives with me, and I only enter his room when he is not home for specific reasons that he already knows about - I may go in because i'm feeling kind and want to gather up dishes that accumulate in there to save him taking them to the kitchen when he's done something to help me out, grab some of his clothes to do a load of laundry, etc.  I would not go through his things or re-arrange them.  He has ADHD, and life is easier for him when he knows exactly where everything is, even though I consider his \"organization\" process to be a total mess.

It's disrespectful for your grandma to ho through your stuff and continually enter your room", "And entering in the middle of the night", "NTA. I'm late so I read through your other responses. Mom says grandma was always like this. So this is plain old narcissism. It may be compounded by an underlying mental condition, but she's narcissistic.\n\nShe's doing one of two things, possibly both. She's trying to establish herself in the authority role. This is the disrespecting your space and your personal autonomy. It's not just that she's entering your room, she's also stealing things and waking you up. This shows you it's her room, they are her things, and she controls your life. Whenever you push back, she runs to mom and takes on the victim role. These are all common narcissistic tactics.\n\nThe second is she may be trying to get you out. Mom's already making noises about that. If she can get you out, then it's her and mom and she can then get mom in a role that she is familiar with for her own needs. You're in the way because mom is protective of you.\n\nThe other thing to be aware of is narcissist detest boundaries. Once they choose a target for their abuse (And what she is doing to you is emotional abuse) they want unrestricted access to their target. You putting up a lock is a restriction. So she is doing everything she can to get the restriction removed. You have seen what this entails. She will do whatever it takes including lies and emotional blackmail.\n\nYour grandma is toxic and is making plans. The very best thing you and mom can do is send her back where she came from. If that doesn't happen, then you are going to need to start looking for somewhere else to stay. This isn't going to improve as long as mom supports grandma.\n\nI'm sorry. You are in a bad spot. You don't deserve any of this.", "NTA, everyone has a right to have their own space. You need it more.\n\nDon't take the lock off, but you may have to talk to your mom, since I think either grandma:\n\n\nmay be feeling useless and stressed because she is waiting for the baby and feels like she can't do much.

No. You are not the issue. There may be one with your grandmother though and it is worth it taking the time to ask your mom. If you need to go on a walk with her to have a private conversation, do it. \nHope you all come out ok and hope the mother and baby will be healthy and happy.", "NTA. Your mom and granny are way out of line. You\u2019re entitled to privacy and despite being asked to stay out, granny has ignored that and willing violated your boundary and space.
