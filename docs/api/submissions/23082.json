Your decision to put a lock on your door is a reasonable way to establish boundaries and protect your personal space. As someone with autism, having a safe and consistent environment is crucial for your well-being. \n\nYou and your mum have already asked your grandma not to go into your room, but she continued to invade your space, which caused distress. \n\nPutting a lock on your door was a necessary measure to ensure your comfort and protect your belongings. \n\nFor me it's important to prioritize our mental well-being, and setting boundaries is a valid way.", "You're NTA. \n\n>i assume this upset her as my mum \u2018went off\u2019 on me about how it\u2019s disrespectful to do so.\n\nNope. What's disrespectful is invading someone's personal space. There is nothing disrespectful about protecting your personal space. It's just a lock. It's not like you put out huge **No Trespassing** signs and wired your doorknob against intruders.", "NTA but have you considered you Nana might be developing dementia? These are some pretty serious signs\u2026", "If it's your Mum's house, you should have asked her permission first, but I totally get it.

I agree . As a mom, I enter my daughter\u2019s room after knocking but it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t mind.

Has she been seen by a doctor recently?", "yeah, i understand from my mum\u2019s perspective as it is her mum but also she is stressed enough as it\u2019s happening throughout where things are being broken. regarding the house we each pay 50% of the bills/rent", "glad i\u2019m not the only one, thank you", "yeah both my mum and myself have asked my grandma everyday to not do it \u2026 this went on for a week or two until i decided to put a lock", "OP mentioned that OP and their mom had asked her to stop about twice a day", "Yes and your mom. Also i didn't really understand why she has to stay with you. Is she helping your aunt and is this way closer to her?", "If you're mum's on your side, it's weird she wouldn't support you now... probably some context on that.

Last question: how strong is your autism - Is it a \"bad but very functional\" or a \"every other twitch streamer\" level? Sry for asking it might help with suggestions on how to proceed", "I'd focus on that probs.", "can i ask what \u201cevery other twitch streamer\u201d means? is it the type of thing where everyone says they have autism just bc they have like one \u201ccharacteristic\u201d of autism? bc if so then probably around the \u201cbad but very functional\u201d", "Even though i said it in a funny way you did guess it right! Thank you for answering.\n\nSo then I'd say grandma has to obey these boundaries very much. What you need to understand is that grandma is old and in the last chapter of her life. People at that age have a difficult time to change things because they did things like that for a very long time in a certain way. Now that doesn't mean she shouldn't try, especially when it comes to you.\n\nI assume you have a doctor who knows you and your needs. It might help grandma understand you better if someone like that would tell her what she needs to watch out for and do to make life easier for you.\n\nI hope this helps", "yeah i understand the fact of her being older hence this post so i can see if maybe i\u2019m being too \u201cunfair\u201d\u2026 i would love to get her to talk to my therapist but there\u2019s a language barrier that prevents that but i really appreciate your help with this"]}
