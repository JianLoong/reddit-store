For years my dad has tried to set us up and nobody I\u2019ve ever dated has compared to perfect Theo in my dad\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s frustrating and embarrassing since my dad isn\u2019t subtle at all.\n\nIt was my dad\u2019s birthday recently and Theo and his family were invited to his party. My dad jokingly made a comment about how he needed a nice boy like Theo to take me on a date since my ex recently ended our engagement. Usually, Theo will just smile politely and not say anything but this time he and his dad were playing along with my dad\u2019s joke. I was upset and embarrassed since Theo and I hooked up a few times in the past but he pretended I didn\u2019t exist after he got what he wanted so hearing him play along made me angry.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, I mentioned how we had already fucked and he wasn\u2019t such a nice boy. Things were awkward so I quickly excused myself but I had a fight with my dad after the party. He said I had embarrassed him in front of his guests and I should\u2019ve told him sooner what Theo had done to me instead of causing a scene the way I did. Theo is also angry with me for making him look bad and we\u2019ve been arguing over texts for a few days now.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Literally.", "This is in the \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes\" category of NTA.\n\nIt sounds like both your dad and Theo were happy to humiliate you in front of others; they don't get to complain about being embarrassed when you defend yourself.\n\nYour dad also doesn't get to dictate how and when you should tell him deeply personal information. Perhaps he should have been more respectful from the start.\n\nTheo just sounds like an arsehole", "Exactly this.", "?", "*psst* I think you posted on the wrong one....", "Should someone really need to say that being publicly made fun of about their relationship history hurts?

It probably was! The one with the son in the hospital and he missed his niece\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s probably my app being screwy.", "Oh, yeah. But it sounds like he was just giving context that OP is single, not making fun of her for having a broken engagement", "Yes! It was that one!"]}
