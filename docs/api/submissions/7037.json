There is absolutely no universe where homophobic remarks are okay, and at 17 & 19 they should know this already. \n\nMen so often think that they should literally bully their friends, siblings, partners, coworkers, etc to show \"affection.\" This is how abuse has become normalized. Girls are told from childhood if the boy picks on you he likes you, it's unacceptable. It's the same here.\n\nIt sounds like these boys, and your husband, have serious issues handling their emotions so they resort to jokes, and they suffer from toxic masculinity. \n\nHonestly, they probably need therapy, and a wake up call for how unfunny homophobia is. I won't say they were raised wrong, but your husband excusing their behavior at the expense of his other son is telling.", "YTA. Siblings will always take the p\\*ss out of each other. You just had to be butt hurt on your gay sons behalf. They said they already knew and that they love him.

This isn't bullying or bigotry this is just how they act with each other and I'm sure the youngest has done the same with them this was just a sensitive moment for him.\n\n Have they made any hateful comments to any gay persons other than their brother? Was the youngest really upset or was it just you who didn't like the comments and thinking he was about to cry to justify your opinion. \n\nThey hugged him and showed gratitude and being gay isn't going to change their relationship and you probably drove a wedge right through that. Now there is an ongoing argument that you started center around your youngest coming out to the point where he might think it's his fault, not only have you alienated your youngest but also caused issues with your older two.", "Excellent point made, I second this!", "NTA, obviously - good on ya for setting boundaries with your kids straight away.", "Personally I think that if we don't know how the relationship between brothers was BEFORE the reveal,  how their sibling dynamics work and how the 15yo feels about the situation, we can't decide if OP is TA.\n\nMe and my brothers throw insults at each other constantly, things that we would never tell anyone else, but we would still DIE for each other. I have a white female friend who has a black adopted brother, at one point they started throwing racist jokes at each other; but they still deeply love each other. Doe that mean they are racist? No it's just THEIR dynamic.", "> Your sons can cut the routine for 20 minutes to listen to a genuinely important message.\n\nI mean, isn\u2019t continuing to treat him exactly the same as they did before he came out a good thing?", "Holy shit have you never been around people before. That is a terrible suggestion that will only breed resentment and make the situation so much worse. At that point just kick the 17 year old out of the house and disown him. At no point in human history has canceling someone's birthday and then leaving them behind from a vacation made them nicer or better people.", "This is so cute!!", "I feel like that conversation would be like \"you dont need to be sensative about your brothers, its okay, we still love you even if youre, you know . . .\"", "Do you do that at the table, in front of family after they tell you something personal and sensitive?", "The boy was about to cry. NTA", "The boy was about to cry clearly he was bothered by them", "One of my friend\u2019s gave me a black eye when we were teenagers because I accidentally knocked his little brother down when we were playing soccer in our backyard. \n\nHe ran up to me after it happened, punched me in the face, and shouted \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with my brother\u201d. \n\n\nLiterally like 90 minutes before that, he was sitting on his brother\u2019s chest, rubbing dirt in his face, and calling him a little girl for crying. In front of all our friends and all his brother\u2019s friends. \n\nBrothers are weird.", "yeah a sibling relationship is different from other relationships. My siblings and I talk mad shit to each other as jokes, but we still love each other and know its jokes and have apologize when some hit too hard.

My oldest brother always\u2026 I mean ALWAYS gave me hell and we fought like cats and dogs. Physically and verbally. Well there was a neighborhood bully my brother\u2019s age. He made the mistake of starting in on me one day after school. My brother beat the snot out of him.
