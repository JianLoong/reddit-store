They also need to learn to read the room -- that is, to pay attention to how others are feeling and reacting, and adjust your behavior accordingly.

If you're doing it because you all love each other and that's just part of how you play, then your goal should be to make sure that everyone is having fun.\n\nMaybe the older brothers here did just mean it as \"funny\".  They failed when they couldn't tell that their brother wasn't in the same mindset at that moment and was genuinely upset.  They're older teens, and it's time to start learning how to pay attention to others' emotions and read the room, and adjust their behavior accordingly.  They deserve the punishment for failing to do that alone (and for just ignoring their mother).\n\nThe father is also in the wrong here because he's backing up the whole \"it was just a joke\" thing.  Some people never actually grow out of thinking that that's an all-purpose excuse even when you hurt someone else.

It can be a coping mechanism. But it's still not appropriate to all social situations.  You absolutely cannot do that with another queer person you just met.\n\nHere, though, I have to agree with you.  This was NOT the moment.  The older brothers are, as far as everyone else knows, not queer themselves.  They haven't lived with that or faced that kind of homophobia personally.

But the problem is they didn't see it as \"being cruel\" -- they don't \\*realize\\* or understand, yet, that it was being cruel.  They haven't had the breakthrough to realize that sometimes jokes ARE hurtful.  And they haven't ever been sat down to think about why they think homophobic jokes are funny, either.\n\nEven if they otherwise have had a relationship where all three of them give each other shit through joking, and it's fine, they have to wake up to the fact that it is not \"fine\" in every situation.  It's okay when everyone there has opted in, as it were.  It's okay when you all trust each other.  And yeah, it seems like a lot of \"work\" when they just want to \"have fun\" (or appear clever, or appear funny and the life of the party, etc.) to stop and make sure, \"is everyone here on this same wavelength?  Or is someone else experiencing different emotions about this and it's stopped being fun for them?\" (at which point, THEY need to stop the behavior.)\n\nThey also just cannot realize what the youngest is going through -- how terrifying it is to come out to your family, because even if you and your family had a loving relationship before that, unless the family has made other indications that they're fine with it, you just never know if they are going to suddenly turn on you because you're gay.   And some family members get offended by that, even -- like, \"you should have known I would love you anyway! How can you think I would reject you!\"  They don't realize how often that happens to people when they come out to family -- that family they thought they knew, that they thought truly loved them and would always love them, suddenly rejected them.\n\n\"We already knew\" is actually NOT as reassuring to the person who came out as people think it is.\n\nAnd the thing is -- if the older brothers immediately started in on homophobic jokes to \"ease the tension\" (or whatever), chances are they have made homophobic jokes in the past as a matter of course.  And that means the youngest had a REAL CONCERN that his brothers \\*really did\\* believe all of that shit.  \n\nFinally I just want to say -- your last lines there are very important.  The older brothers' behavior here didn't develop in a vacuum.  Boys and young men are surrounded by these bad examples, and they are taught by these examples that \"it's just a joke\" is an all-purpose excuse.   Some people never grow out of that, either.  OP's sons have the opportunity to grow out of that, if she can find a way to talk to them and get them to really think about it.\n\n(In fact, OP's husband is sort of looking here like someone who never grew out of it himself.  He could use this same talk.)", "In addition, make them explain what made the \"jokes\" funny.", "So this. Teen boys are little shits. Set that straight!", ">ever have guy friends?\n\nYeah and mine aren't assholes.", "Even short of that, bigoted jokes are always bigotry.  \n\nThey might be a defense mechanism (i.e. \"I'm making homophobic jokes so that nobody thinks that I might be gay!  Because being gay is seen as bad!\"  or \"I'm making racist jokes because in this time/place I think that I need to look 'tough', and not look like I'm some uncool woke 'liberal', because I can see how everyone else thinks being 'woke' and 'liberal' is bad.\")\n\nOR, they can just be a straight-up indication of espousing those bigoted beliefs.  The line is very thin between \"I don't want to be seen as part of this group I'm mocking, because the social circle I'm in has indicated it's bad\" and \"I buy into the prevalent thinking that being a part of that group IS bad.\"\n\nThis is not to take away from what you're saying here, because it's also very important for people to realize.  \n\nI'm just mentioning this because a lot of people have this reflexive reaction against the idea that they have fallen for actual propaganda and so on.  When you're dealing with people like this, and you think there is room to talk them through it, it's probably a good idea to start at the personal level, rather than at the larger, systemic level.

So if you're not saying it \"to be mean\", or in a mean way, you're not \\*really\\* being a bigot.   They're wrong, of course -- but I think this is what a lot of people tell themselves.\n\nPeople always want to think that they are good people.  And generally, people know that \"being a bigot\" is a bad thing, and people who are bigots are bad people.  So if they are a good person (which they know they are), they can't be a bigot, because that would mean they're a bad person.  They're invested in not thinking of themselves as being a bad person, or others thinking they are a bad person.\n\nAND, this all dovetails with the way a lot of boys and men are raised to think that \"having emotions\" is not manly, and being considerate of others' emotions is also not manly.  That's why so many things are \"a joke\" -- it's also partly a way to avoid sincerity, because being sincere about touchy-feely stuff isn't manly.  \n\nSo the idea that they should notice when they have hurt someone else's feelings, especially another man's feelings... there is a whole lot to unpack there about \"noticing / being considerate of other people's feelings is uncool\", \"a man admitting he has certain feelings, like being hurt, is uncool\", and \"I can't admit that I might be a bad person\".\n\n(Which is also why it's a good idea to help people make the distinction between \"doing a bad thing\" and \"being a bad person\".  If you do a bad thing, it doesn't mean you're a bad person.  But, you have to work to realize it was a bad thing to do, you have to try to make amends, and you have to work on not doing that any more.  Focusing on the idea that doing bad things or holding bad beliefs makes someone a bad person isn't helpful, because in the first place it causes that automatic defense of the ego -- \"I can't be a bad person\"; and, it interferes with the idea that someone can grow and change by changing their behavior and gradually their beliefs.  \"Being a good person\" or \"being a bad person\" is seen as a more intrinsic thing that someone is locked into forever; but if they think they are locked into it forever, there's no incentive to change.  And that way of thinking is actually at the core of a lot of protestant Christian doctrine, so that makes it even harder for people to break out of.)", "Eek, I didn't mean to make you feel nonplussed.
