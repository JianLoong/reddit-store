We have both been very busy with work lately, but her birthday fell on a day she has off. As a surprise, I took the day off and had made reservations at her favorite restaurant (it\u2019s almost impossible to get a table there without reservations). I had also gotten groceries to make her favorite desert (tiramisu). \n\n\n\n\nHowever, the night before her birthday she casually mentioned that she would be going away for the day with some friends. When I confessed that I had made plans and reservations as a surprise, she just very casually apologized. I acknowledged that it was her birthday and that she could do as she pleases, but expressed that I was hurt she was going with her friends instead of spending the day together. \n\n\n\n\nI informed her that I had to re-schedule all my appointments at work so I could get the day off and pointed out she had never mentioned that she planned on going away for her birthday. She stated that she felt bad, but would feel shitty canceling on her friends. I asked if she didn\u2019t feel bad canceling on me, which she said she did but stated she made the plans the day before and didn\u2019t know about my intentions. \n\n\n\n\nShe asked me what I expected her to do, and I again informed her that I would like for us to spend the day together since I had put a decent amount of effort into getting the day off and that it had been a while since we had a day off together. However, I told her it was her birthday and I wasn\u2019t going to make her cancel her other plans if she didn\u2019t want to. She said she was going to still do her day trip with her friends, so I said fine and that I\u2019d use the opportunity to visit my parents and I left that night. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe called me later to apologize again but expressed that she thinks I overreacted by leaving to visit my parents. I told her she wasn\u2019t that sorry - she made a decision and that was fine. I told her that I was a bit hurt by the decision, which is why I was taking space and using the opportunity to visit my parents.\n\n\n\n\nAITA for being upset my wife didn\u2019t want to spend her birthday together? AITA for going to my parents?\n\n\nEDIT: I did ask if she had plans a week beforehand and she said no. She made these plans 2 days before her bday.", "created_utc": 1677870640, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11hbw08/aita_for_wanting_my_wife_to_spend_her_bday_with/", "score": 804, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You chose to take on the labor of planning a very thoughtful day for your wife without making sure her schedule would be 100% clear. You are fully within your right to be upset that the birthday plans didn't go through but don't take it out on her. She is valuing her commitment she made with her friends. Your marriage doesn't trump the other close relationships she has in her life. That being said, you both could have tried to reschedule for another day so you could celebrate together.", "NAH, but this is the gamble you make with \"surprise\" birthday plans.", "I think no one is the AH here. There was lack of communication. When you asked a week before what her plans are you could have said something there like keep it open for us, I\u2019m thinking of planning something. Or asked her what she would like to do and see if you can make it happen. Before planning something for the individual try to include them in or else how would they know and make plans for themselves?\nAlso, you\u2019re taking it out on her for all the hard efforts you did to only feel unappreciated but if she was informed all those efforts you did would have been rewarded. Just communicate next time", "Take it as a learning opportunity to be transparent and be clear on where to be for the surprise.  I personally think surprises should be planned really carefully to make sure is what they want. \n\nI\u2019d let her do her friends plans", "YTA - She didn't cancel any plans with you because you never made any with her. You made them yourself without informing her. If you want to do something with her...... Make he plans with her....", "YTA, you never told her you had the day off before and just expected her to cancel through ambush after she told you about plans she most likely was looking forward to with friends she probably hasnt seen in a while after.\n\nYour lack of communication, despite with the intention of a surprise, is at fault here. Not your wife", "YTA. This is a risk you take when you plan a surprise. Going to your parents was like taking your ball and going home because you didn\u2019t get your way.", "YTA how was she supposed to know?", "Too many N T A posts assuming that OP's wife is omniscient and should have know without being told that her husband was planning something, despite him actively pretending otherwise and, presumably, hurting her feelings in the process.", "YTA for guilt-tripping her once this all came out. It\u2019s not her fault she didn\u2019t anticipate your surprise. If you had taken it gracefully, she might have been able to enjoy her outing without negativity and probably told her friends how thoughtful her husband was while they were out having fun. Instead you made sure you were on her mind in a negative way, getting in the way of her being able to enjoy herself.", "YTA. If you had just felt bad, but didn't run away or throw a tantrum, I would have gone with NAH.\n\nWhat you have to understand is that when you plan a surprise for someone, you are running a risk that the surprise will not work out. Keeping it hidden means the other person can't leave the time free - they have no idea there is a reason to do so. If you want to ensure that you spend the day with her, you should have said when you were first thinking about it, \"Hey, I think I can rearrange things to have your birthday off, and we can spend the day together.\" Then she could have planned for it. You took away her ability to plan for it, then threw a tantrum when it meant she didn't cancel everything to do what you wanted.\n\nIt doesn't matter if she had plans a week before.

To err on the safe side you should have told her you\u2019d be off and had some surprises planned for her day. You being off shouldn\u2019t have been the surprise", "ESH.\n\nCommunication would have been good here.  Example: \u201cHey, you have your birthday off?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent.

If you\u2019re going to plan something for someone then you need to clear it with the person, if not you don\u2019t get to be upset if your plans don\u2019t work. Also, she spends everyday with you, I\u2019m sure she spends less time with her friends. She wanted to go out and have some girl time with her birthday,  you guys live together and can easily plan a different time to do dinner and dessert.", "YTA\n\nAnyone who has ever organized a surprise party knows that step one is making sure the person you're trying to surprise doesn't have other plans, and then making sure they're tied up in such a way that they don't think about making other plans.", "YTA, but I don't really feel you count as being an asshole. You decided to surprise her by shifting your schedule and making plans, but she had other plans already. It's not her fault she made plans with her friends, until today she thought you had to work. It's not your fault that you set up a nice surprise for her, but your reaction to being told she'd made plans with friends already isn't fair to her. You tried to guilt her into cancelling her plans because you'd cleared your schedule that day and specifically asked her if she felt bad cancelling on you, when that's not what she did at all. She can't cancel plans she never knew about and never agreed to.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t cancel plans with you. You can\u2019t cancel plans that don\u2019t exist. You also told her to do what she wanted and then got mad she didn\u2019t pick you. That sounds like you were basically saying \u201cdo what you want but it better be spending time with me\u201d.", "YTA. You sound exhausting. If your schedules are that tight, you should have told her that you were planning something for her and to not make plans for at least dinner. And maybe don\u2019t wait until less than a week before your wife\u2019s birthday to throw something together.", ">I did ask if she had plans a week beforehand and she said no. She made these plans 2 days before her bday.\n\nBut did you ask her to keep the time clear for you? She's not psychic you know.", "NTA Homie, you wanted to do something nice for you WIFE, asked her in advance if she was free, and she said yes. its a SURPRISE for a reason. all the comments here must be some lonely losers if they think it's your fault for not telling your WIFE you wanted to surprise her on her birthday. frankly you did what was expected and she ditched you for her friends. you are right to feel hurt, because evidently on her birthday shed rather hang out with her friend thant be given a nice treat by her HUSBAND", "Natural for you to feel disappointed however how challenging would it be to reschedule reservations & just go in to work? She had planned something without any knowledge of what you were doing. Don\u2019t take it personally because it\u2019s not about you. Just a simple miscommunication. \n\nYour wife is enjoying her birthday that should make you happy! Now you have a chance to make it extra special for her by continuing the celebrating for multiple days. \n\nSorry YTA", "YTA She didn\u2019t cancel on you. You sprung plans you had made on her last minute after she told you she had made plans with her friends. Next time, let her know you\u2019re making plans.", "YTA - the thing with surprises is that it can always go sideways and you were not ready for it.", "Nah, even when you overreacted.\n\nBut: that's the exact reason why I hate being surprised - someone else makes plans and lots of effort to make them happen, and when *my* plans are spontaneously changing? All ruined and sad people everywhere", "Yta. You're upset with her because you chose to not tell her your plans? Grow up.", "YTA. You can\u2019t take a whole day off without telling her and then expect her to want to follow your plan for her bday. \n\nIt\u2019s her bday and not for you to dictate how she spends her day. Sure it would be nice to spend it together but as far as she knew you were going to be working the whole day so she made other plans.\n\nAlso,how is she supposed to feel bad for \u201ccancelling\u201d on you when she never had plans with you in the first place? You can\u2019t cancel something that never existed. She would however be canceling on the plans she made with several friends.\n\nMy question is can\u2019t you all go together maybe? Or maybe adapt plans a bit? Maybe she spends the day with friends and meets you for dinner if it doesn\u2019t throw her plans off too much? Or make a rez for the restaurant on another date. You got a rez with 2 days notice so it can\u2019t be that hard to get into.\n\nEither way, this plan falling apart is 100% on you for failing to communicate and check with her before unilaterally deciding how you wanted her to spend her bday with you. Guilt tripping her and punishing her on her bday is just further immaturity. It sounds very exhausting to deal with you. It that really the tone you want to set for yourself?\n\nYes she should have communicated her plans too but it doesn\u2019t negate all of the things you\u2019ve done wrong here.", "NTA, but this is a tough one. You should have told her that you took off the day and have a surprise for her to reserve the day. She said she made the plans the day before, so this really could have been avoided. It sounds like her friends rallied to make a nice birthday because she had no plans with you. \n\nIf your wife had said \"I would really rather go with you and have the day together. It sounds like a perfect day. But, I think I should go with my friends because I made the commitment. They made arrangements and spent money. I wouldn't want to injure friendships by canceling. Can you understand my choice? I don't want you to think that I don't appreciate your effort, but I should keep my word.\"   \nWould it have made a difference? If so, tell her that. Because I don't think you are hurt because she made other plans. You sound hurt because you think she rather be with them.", "\" asked if she didn\u2019t feel bad canceling on me\"\n\nBut... you hadn't actually made any plans with her, had you?  YOU made plans, but you never actually told her until the day before.  By that time, she had made plans with her friends.  She didn't cancel on you.  There was nothing to cancel!  Surprises can be fun, but they do run the danger of conflicting with other people's plans... as happened here.  I wouldn'nt say your the AH here.... you tried to do something nice for here, and it just didn't work out... except that you tried to guilt her for not cancelling her plans with her friends afterwards. For that... sorry, but YTA.", "YTA - she can\u2019t cancel plans she didn\u2019t know she had. You\u2019re not the asshole for wanting to spend the day with her, YTA for guilt tripping her when your surprise didn\u2019t work out. This situation is 100% your fault and your actions led to your own inconvenience. You owe your wife a massive apology", "YTA.  Surprises are often more for the Surpriser than the Surprisee. Now you know.", "YTA this is a perfect example of why surprise are so much worse in reality. Did you expect her to just make plans for her birthday? Because from her perspective you were working and unavailable. If you wanted the plans to be a surprise you could have at least told her you were taking the day off and wanted to plan the day for her.", "NTA - if she was still making these plans with her friends, she could spin it with her friends and say \u201cmy partner just let me know that he had planned a whole surprise day for me tomorrow! I am sorry for the late change in plans, but unfortunately, I\u2019m no longer able to attend the trip. I hope you all have fun!\u201d \n\nIt makes it worse that she didn\u2019t cancel her plans with her friends because she had only made the plans a day before. She could also find a night to celebrate her birthday with her friends later that week. \n\nThe only thing you should have done is stayed the night with her and wished her a happy birthday in the morning before leaving for your parents. That can definitely seem like a passive aggressive move but I understand your thought process and short term thinking in the moment.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here and saying NTA. If I found out my wife made plans for me so we could have some us time, I would definitely cancel on the friends. Thankfully, my friends would understand. Not sure for clingy her friends are.", "NTA for being upset, you went out of your way rearranged your worklife, shopped and planned. All to find out she had other plans - i feel bad for you. she is correct, she never agreed to your plans, so she isn't cancelling and it would be in poor form to cancel on her friends.\n\nHowever, please don't read more into this than there is, she doesn't dislike you, she doesn't like them more than she likes you.  Enjoy the day\n\nnext time ask her before you rearrange your life.", "YTA she probably assumed you were working as you said you booked it off as a surprise. My partner usually works his and my birthdays so I plan something on a day we\u2019re both off. We also communicate when we book time off. You could have just said \u201ckeep your birthday free because I\u2019ll plan something\u201d and still had a surprise", "NAH. You went out of your way to make plans to surprise her for her birthday. That was very sweet. I totally understand that you were hurt. But your wife really was put in a bad position. She would have upset someone no matter what choice she made. I don't think you were wrong in going to your parents or in being hurt. The only issue I have is that it does kinda look like you were punishing her.", "YTA because you pouted about it and made her feel bad. It's okay to feel hurt but your reaction was unnecessary and you made her bday more about you. Also, her friends probably moved stuff around too. Give her a heads up next time and stop pouting and running to your parents.", "Unpopular opinion but NTA.\n\nHonestly I\u2019d feel way worse for saying no to my husband\u2019s surprise than canceling on my friends. Both are nice gestures. But if I haven\u2019t had a day off with my husband in a long time, as your situation is, then I\u2019d be so excited to spend the day with him for my birthday. My friends would understand that spouses come first- and would probably still do the trip without me and make it a girls\u2019 day.", "Why would you put all the effort into the plans and zero effort in actually reserving time with your wife, confirming with her that you would spend the day together? Lesson learned.", "YTA deep breaths because this is blunt and it will be hard to hear.\n\nShe did nothing wrong and you're mirroring your feelings on to her. You feel bad, so she should too and she should see this great injustice you've created being done to you and change her plans. Her birthday is about her. She shouldn't feel bad for keeping the plans she made before she knew you were even available, and you shouldn't insist she feel bad. And she can't cancel on you when she didn't even have plans with you. Also, this is why surprises often don't work out. Next time let her know you have the day off but make other things the surprise so she already has time set aside for you.\n\nAnd yes, going off to your parents is imo extreme for this situation, and just another level of trying to escalate her punishment to try to elicit the response you want of her. Believe me even if she gives it to you, you won't feel good at this point. \n\nEven if you don't share this post with her, I hope you take the time to really sit with all of it and internalize it and self analyze what's going on inside.", "YTA. I\u2019m surprised you guys didn\u2019t talk about what she wanted to do far in advance. I usually ask like a month before. Also you leaving in a huff and pouting ensures she\u2019s not going to have a good time on her girl trip. You could\u2019ve still been there when she woke up and had some doughnuts and coffee for her.", "I hate this idea that \u201cOh you didn\u2019t tell her you had something planned, so you\u2019re the A-H\u201d. \n\nHe asked her if she had plans on her Birthday a week before, probably with a glint of \u201ci have a surprise for you\u201d in his eyes.\n\nSure, she\u2019s not a mind reader, but come on. If she asked him if he had anything planned for her, and he said no, that\u2019s a little different. But she\u2019s definitely an AH in this situation.\n\nNot to mention that he didn\u2019t really react badly to this news. He calmly expressed he was hurt and gave her the space that she clearly wanted, since she chose her friends over him.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: a typo and that paragraph at the end", "NAH. A miscommunication. Neither of you did anything wrong, and you\u2019re entitled to your disappointment. Don\u2019t try to make her feel guilty though.", "NAH. It seems that what happened was sadly a case of lac of communication. It was very sweet that you had everything planned out to celebrate her bday, but if your wife didn't know you were going to take the day off, how was she supposed to know that she shouldn't have made plans with her friends? Was she supposed to assume she should sit at home all day by herself?", "YTA, simply for dictating how sorry she is. Until you\u2019re living as her in the moment, you don\u2019t get to decide the degree of her emotions. Maybe she was just excited? You conveniently leave out any details regarding her and just give your peace - which is fine in an off my chest post but not here.", "Well you communicated your feelings clearly and didn\u2019t really do anything wrong.

Yeah but it is what it is.", "YTA and such baby. Either you make plans or you don\u2019t. You didn\u2019t. She did. You don\u2019t get to be mad at her on her birthday. I feel sorry for your wife.

He wants a minute apart, because she chose her friends over him. And now she's mad about that.", "NAH. OP is allowed to have a reaction to a surprise being ruined. This does no mean it's his wife's fault, but he's allowed to be upset and hurt.

As far as she knew, you'd be working. I get the intention of wanting to give her a surprise day out, but you can't just assume she plans on sitting around by herself on her birthday, pining after you while you're away. She's a grown woman, of course she made plans, and as she likely initiated them, she would be a jerk for cancelling on her friends. \n\nIf you want to do something like that in the future, coordinate with her friends to surprise her, or just don't do surprises.

If you want to surprise someone on their birthday you need to let them in on at least the bare bones of the plan.

I don\u2019t know why she was upset that you left to your parents to not waste the day off, did she want you the house just twiddling your thumbs? She made the decision to not reschedule with her friends. Also clearly her friends have way more flexibility with their schedules that they can get take time off with a 1 day notice vs you that you have to rearrange your schedule in advanced.

Sometimes things just don\u2019t work out. I think taking the space was a good idea and not an over reaction  - you were upset, and instead of being upset alone used the time you took off. I also think everyone is overlooking that you didn\u2019t force her to do the things with you. You let her choose and dealt with your feelings without screaming or becoming irrationally upset (unless you\u2019re leaving that info out, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it)\n\nI think some better communication skills should be established to remedy this. Maybe next time instead of having to choose, a compromise could be created.", "NAH I don\u2019t think anyone is the A S here. The risk of surprises is that people will do something on that day : surprises should be made aware in advance to her friends, family, and her (that you want her to be available that day). She had plans with her friends before she had plans with you, her friends might have spend time preparing too. However I don\u2019t think you are the A S for being hurt neither, and for needing space to make sense of your emotions. At the end it is such a small thing that quickly you\u2019ll notice that it doesn\u2019t matter, after the day is gone.

Its nice you wanted to surprise her, but you need to actually verbalize that you want to do something together rather than just assume she won't have other plans.

We have both been very busy with work lately, but her birthday fell on a day she has off. As a surprise, I took the day off and had made reservations at her favorite restaurant (it\u2019s almost impossible to get a table there without reservations). I had also gotten groceries to make her favorite desert (tiramisu). \n\n\n\n\nHowever, the night before her birthday she casually mentioned that she would be going away for the day with some friends. When I confessed that I had made plans and reservations as a surprise, she just very casually apologized. I acknowledged that it was her birthday and that she could do as she pleases, but expressed that I was hurt she was going with her friends instead of spending the day together. \n\n\n\n\nI informed her that I had to re-schedule all my appointments at work so I could get the day off and pointed out she had never mentioned that she planned on going away for her birthday. She stated that she felt bad, but would feel shitty canceling on her friends. I asked if she didn\u2019t feel bad canceling on me, which she said she did but stated she made the plans the day before and didn\u2019t know about my intentions. \n\n\n\n\nShe asked me what I expected her to do, and I again informed her that I would like for us to spend the day together since I had put a decent amount of effort into getting the day off and that it had been a while since we had a day off together. However, I told her it was her birthday and I wasn\u2019t going to make her cancel her other plans if she didn\u2019t want to. She said she was going to still do her day trip with her friends, so I said fine and that I\u2019d use the opportunity to visit my parents and I left that night. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe called me later to apologize again but expressed that she thinks I overreacted by leaving to visit my parents. I told her she wasn\u2019t that sorry - she made a decision and that was fine. I told her that I was a bit hurt by the decision, which is why I was taking space and using the opportunity to visit my parents.\n\n\n\n\nAITA for being upset my wife didn\u2019t want to spend her birthday together?

You did nothing wrong and yes you can be disappointed and I think it was fairly fine to visit your parents to keep your head staright. I know disappointment often cause reactions and as far as I understand you went to visit your parents to avoid any reaction.\n\nAlthough if my husband would've made plans for me, I would cancel all my plans with my friends in a heartbeat. Yes she's a right to celebrate her birthday with whomever she wants but I think your significant other should be priority (I may get down voted for this opinion but this is how I feel).\n\nI also feel like if genders were reversed people would still be calling you asshole.

That's nice you wanted to surprise her, but you probably should have just surprised her with the specific plans, and not that you made plans at all.

My mom texted me Wednesday morning saying that she booked a photo shoot for me for the 31st. I\u2019m taking 2 days off that week. I HAVE to work on the 31st or I won\u2019t be getting paid. I need money. She was upset but she was able to get her money back. She apologized. But this is something she does all the time.", "YTA.

That's on you.

Would have been a perfectly good compromise and your day off could definitely have been spent cleaning the house, taking care of things she's been meaning to do, generally being helpful and making her life better.
