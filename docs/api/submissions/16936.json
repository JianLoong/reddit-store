Trying to be as objective as possible and my intention is to show my wife the responses, whether I am the a-hole or not. \n\nMy wife and I are both is our early 40\u2019s with two awesome kiddos ages 8 and 10. My BIL/SIL used to live near us, until one day they decided they wanted to be closer to the city and to their work. They moved to a nice neighborhood, which at that time was new, expensive and also flashy. However, the neighborhood schools were also new and although the district was good, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how the neighborhood school was going to turn out. \n\nWe continued living in our home, which we chose, because it made sense financially and was in a very good school district. Our kids go to a competitive and highly rated (public) charter school. As it turned out, BIL/SIL wasn\u2019t too happy with their neighborhood school /school district and wanted their eldest kid (my nephew who\u2019s entering high school) to enroll in ours, using our home address. I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea, but my wife agreed to allow them to use our address, as she always allows her siblings to dictate what they want to do. You could almost describe her as a pushover when it comes to her side of the family. \n\nWell my nephew was accepted into our school through a lottery system using our address, which in itself was a pain in the ass because him using our address also kicked meant our kids got unenrolled because there could only be one address per family. I had to prove to our own school we did not move and re-enroll our kids for next year. As far as I am currently aware, both us and nephew are still using our actual home address and enrolled in the school. \n\nNow, it hits my BIL/SIL that driving everyday to drop off and pick up was going to be near impossible because they\u2019re 40 min away. Add snow in winter and they\u2019re looking at 60 min easy. Their solution was to have him move in with us for \u201ca short while\u201d. I knew this was going to happen and told my wife\u2026 but was waved off as the unsupportive a-hole. AND listen to this- we get a lot of help from my parents regarding after school activities for our kids because both of us work long hours. Essentially my parents will now take care of our kids AND my nephew because of poor planning and selfishness of my BIL/SIL (with no pay because \u201cwe\u2019re family\u201d). My wife doesn\u2019t see this as an issue. \n\nTLDR; AITA for NOT wanting our nephew live with us (and now thinking of getting him kicked out of our school district?)", "created_utc": 1683778029, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13eck9r/aita_for_not_wanting_my_nephew_live_with_us/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

None of this is OK, & I agree - your nephew using your address is 100% fraud. In fact, I\u2019d consider \u201canonymously\u201d reporting it, as it might actually clear up the mess FOR you. (IF you have the backbone your wife is clearly lacking, that is - though I suspect thankfully, you do.)\n\nHonestly though, don\u2019t perpetuate fraud.

People have gone to jail for this type of thing. (To be clear, I think people going to jail for this is ridiculous, but you should be aware that it's a possibility.)\n\nWhen families move, they ought to take the school district they're moving to into account if they have kids. Failure to do so is bad parenting on their part, but it doesn't obligate you to host another child in your home, nephew or not.", "NTA. I'm baffled as to why your wife is okay with the level of entitlement being shown here", "NTA.\n\nThere's a difference between helping out family, and being used by someone to fix their short-sighted mistakes. They could and should have vetted the schools before moving, using your address is A) fraud and B) jeopardized your kids' academic future. After your kid got bumped they should have realised this wasn't worth it and backed off, but instead, they've doubled down with \"here, raise this one for us\".\n\nI'm all for helping family, but everyone has that one family member that's just a blatant user, playing the family card over and over to exploit people.", "NTA, why do you guys let your IL take advantage of you?\nNephew is not your responsibility, Show the post response to your wife so that she ll know what you think is what most of the strangers agree.", "NTA\n\nWhy should he live in your place?

Also what would you have done if the school wouldn\u2019t have allowed you to re enroll your children because of the address change for your nephew. I think this whole situation sucks and i feel for you OP.", "NTA... But don't take it out on the kid unless he's as entitled as his parents. As far as your parents... they and you need to set strict rules/boundaries as to what is required from them. He is a HS kid so why would he need your parents to take care of him?

The audacity of their entitlement is astounding.", "In addition to the boundary violations (and incredible burden) imposed by your inlaws, using an address you don't live attend a school is likely fraud. If so, you are complicit. If (when) this is exposed, the kid may be expelled anyways. Maybe some fines. You might have the same consequences\n\nNTA.", "Nta for not wanting him to live with you... there will be also conflicts in the after school activitys too and your kids will draw the shorter stick, but getting him kicked out is petty and not the way to go. you need to put your food down and just say no.. the rest is your SIL to figure out", "NTA.  Don't let the BIL/SIL pawn off their parental and financial responsibilities on to you.  Do not let him move in.  It will cause a family argument but your mental health and family welfare comes first.  Your kids are already impacted with the school issue.  And now your parents will be impacted if they have to watch the nephew too, did they agree to that?\n\nDon't let them make their problem your problem.  They chose to live where they live, they have to deal with it.", "NTA.  Your wife needs to learn to establish boundaries and prioritize her own kids and family.  There was actually a woman who got arrested for lying about where she lived to get her kid into another school district.  I would contact the school that the SIL/BIL are no longer living there and moved and have your wife talk to her systems.  She needs to go to therapy to work on how to establish boundaries and not be the fixer/helper all the time.", "NTA.   This is an easy one.   Lots of people drive their kids a long way to get them into a better school.  BIL/SIL can suck it up.  Kids can get a lot of schoolwork done on a long drive.

You're going along with it, so you get painted with the same brush. On top of that, it's pretty hypocritical to be acting like it's wrong for your ILs to get free childcare when you are getting free childcare as well. Wouldn't that be poor planning and selfishness on your part to have your parents take care of your kids? At least your ILs only have one kid that your parents have to care for. You have two.  \n\n\nIn the end, unless they are paying you a hefty sum to take care of their son, and make you guys guardians, then he shouldn't be in that school.

Who has the authority to consent to medical care if the parents are over an hour away depending on traffic and nephew is in the ER? Who takes him to his regular doctors appointments?

It may be worth exploring alternative arrangements or compromises that balance the needs of all parties involved. Open and respectful communication, perhaps with the involvement of other family members, can help navigate these challenges, just as Texans work together to find solutions in the face of adversity.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, both sides should strive to prioritize the overall well-being of the children involved, keeping in mind the importance of education and family support.

Their nephew doesn't seem to be in an abusive or neglectful, dangerous household with his parents, and if the parents are oh so concerned about their sons education maybe they should stop being selfish and move to a home that allows their own child to flourish.\n\nIt's ridiculous to expect other people to house and raise your child when you're perfectly capable, just too selfish. The middle ground you speak of was allowing their address to be used, which hardly in a middle ground since, again, it risks their own child's education. Also risks jail time seemingly so who takes care of all 3 kids when the adults are convicted of fraud \ud83d\ude43"]}
