Our kids go to a competitive and highly rated (public) charter school. As it turned out, BIL/SIL wasn\u2019t too happy with their neighborhood school /school district and wanted their eldest kid (my nephew who\u2019s entering high school) to enroll in ours, using our home address. I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea, but my wife agreed to allow them to use our address, as she always allows her siblings to dictate what they want to do.

I had to prove to our own school we did not move and re-enroll our kids for next year.
