I saw my son had a zero on an assignment and confronted him. He didn't want to tell me why he had a zero, but I insisted. He admitted the assignment was a family tree he was supposed to present to the class but refused to.\n\nHe told me he asked his teacher if he could do his tree on someone else, like a historical figure. The teacher said no, that most historical figures and celebrities have family trees online he would be able to copy. My son did the tree for our family, but he refused to present it. He emailed the tree to his teacher instead. However, the teacher said the assignment was to make and present a tree, and her grading rubric was based on the presentation, so if he didn't present he would get a zero.\n\nI was pretty upset. You expect your kids to not always be upfront with you, but why on earth didn't this teacher contact me when she realized this assignment was problematic for him? And why didn't she grade his work? Why is the presentation 100% of the grade? I would think a complete tree, if done correctly, is at least worth a C.\n\nI contacted the principal to explain my concerns and ask for a meeting. I had the meeting with the principal, teacher and guidance councilor. The teacher explained her reasoning, and I said that my son's embarrassment over some of his family members shouldn't impact his grade. He shouldn't have to choose between exposing himself to his peers and a poor grade.\n\nThe principal asked to see the tree my son emailed to the teacher as well as the grading rubric. The principal said she didn't like the assignment and told the teacher to reformat it if she wanted to use it in future years. She also said she would grade the tree and have the assignment grade changed. The teacher protested, asking what the issue it with her assignment. The principal said they would talk about it after I left.\n\nAs I was leaving the teacher asked me to contact her directly in the future when I have a concern. I explained that I didn't feel comfortable doing so, because of her actions and failure to communicate with me when the problem first arose. She tried to blame my son, but I pointed out that she is the professional and he is eleven. She said I needed to teach my son accountability and not try to blame everyone else when there's a problem. I was mad, so I left before I could say something mean. I know she thinks I'm an asshole because now her assignment has to change, but I feel she brought this on herself.", "created_utc": 1668112799, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrr7av/aita_for_making_a_teacher_change_my_sons_grade/", "score": 8400, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a former social worker in the foster care system, I am LIVID that these are still a routine assignment. They bring up so much trauma for so many people\n\nAnd the fact that there was no wiggle room for him to present it in a different way when there was clearly an issue? You go mom! I\u2019m on your side! NTA", "NTA. My knee-jerk reaction when it comes to parents pressuring teachers to change grades is that it's an AH move but... this isn't an entitled parent deciding that Little Timmy should have a good grade whether he deserves it or not. This is an issue with a child having a problem with the content, and the teacher not even trying to work something out/bring up concerns to the parents. Totally different.", "NTA\n\nMy son has had this assignment twice now (once in middle school and once in high school) and both times the assignment and rubric showed an understanding there are non-traditional families out there, and students who may not have access to family history. The fact that the teacher has gotten to 2022 without her assignment reflecting this, means she's probably hurt quite a few students along the way.", "NTA. I\u2019m a biology teacher, so students have to study family pedigree charts. I purposely don\u2019t have students create one for their own family because there are a ton of situations that students may not want to talk about in class (there are definitely people in my family I wouldn\u2019t want to include). Should you have talked to the teacher before escalating it to the principal? Probably, it\u2019s super frustrating when parents immediately go over your head when it\u2019s something you easily could have fixed if you knew about it. But this teacher doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s entirely reasonable anyway and you probably would have ended up escalating it to the principal anyway.", "NTA. How long has this person been a teacher? The lack of understanding and empathy is crazy. She outright refused to be accommodating. I agree, if she felt so strongly about it she should have reached out to you. But also she shouldn\u2019t have felt so strongly about it anyway because there are so many reasons why that assignment could be difficult for a child and she should have anticipated that.", "NTA - family trees are actually banned from hundreds of school programs now with several schools and teachers coming up with other ways to discuss what heritage paths look like (including your suggestion of a famous person)  \n\n\nAlso, you're going to have a ton of issues with this teacher for the rest of the year bc she obviously had it out for him (which I don't feel is the truth when parents say it 85% of the time) and then to come at you. It's obvious the principal is clear on who is on his staff, but your son is still going to be in that class every day - can he be moved?", "NTA. How could she have not foreseen the trouble it\u2019d cause for students? Especially students with family issues or absent parents? Your son did his assignment anyway and she gave him a zero. You have every right to be pissed in this situation.", "NTA, at all. Former teacher here, you absolutely did the right thing. The fact that the teacher still couldn\u2019t see the problematic nature of her assignment and had to be talked to after the meeting speaks volumes. Good teachers can recognize the need to alter (sometimes even scrap) assignments based on the classroom community. \n\nI hope your son sees how it\u2019s ok to make changes when warranted and I hope the teacher is professional going forward.", "Sounds like your kid did a good job trying to advocate for themselves, offering an alternate assignment. Make sure you also congratulate them on that!", "Well, you surprised me.\n\nWhen I heard that you had made a teacher change your son's grade, I expected this to be a story about how your son got a B+ on a term paper, and you, determined that your kid is going to Harvard, went into the classroom and intimidated the teacher into giving your son an A+.\n\nBut this is not what I expected. I don't like the assignment. A student should not be required to divulge their family tree to the class. What about adopted kids who don't even know their biological parents? What if they're descended from slave-owners, or Nazis or something similarly shameful?\n\nI see nothing wrong with what you did and I see the principal as having proffered a good solution.\n\nThe teacher is entirely in the wrong. If there was a problem, she should have contacted you. Also, she seems to have a hard time dealing with correction, as the principal raised valid concerns about the nature of the assignment.\n\nYou had a good response to her demand that you contact her, not the principal, when there's a problem. She didn't feel comfortable contacting you, so why should you have to contact her?\n\nNTA.\n\nETA The title is wrong. You didn't make the teacher change the grade. The principal volunteered to grade the assignment.", "NTA and way to go for not only standing up for you son but also listening to him . So many parents I know would of flipped out at the sight of the zero and took the teachers word for it but you didn\u2019t you let your kid explain why he didn\u2019t and trusted him!! You have no clue how far that will go in your guys relationship . My mom was like that and it allowed me to be open and honest with her .", "NTA\n\nBut you need to follow up with the principal. Her comments are a clear indicator that there will be retaliation to your son. \n\nI am an educator. I work with teachers. There are some truly wonderful ones. But their are some that shouldn\u2019t be allowed within sight of children.\n\n- this assignment is terrible. No adult should be required to disclose personal familial information for a school assignment. \n\n- she should have a.) asked your son why he was uncomfortable with the assignment b.) pulled herself out of whatever rosy bubble she lives in to understand some people have issues in their family c.) contacted you at the 2nd request not to present the family tree\n\n- she has taken zero accountability for her poor judgment and questionable teaching skills", "NTA. How the teacher could not foresee this being both personal and problematic is wild to me. Example: The kid who doesn\u2019t know who his father is should have to divulge that to the entire class? There are so many scenarios in which the family structure could be a source of pain or embarrassment to a child, especially one in the tween spot of old enough to sort of understand and young enough not to really grasp nuances of certain family issues.", "NTA family trees are actually pretty insensitive. So many kids have non nuclear families that are hard to explain esp at such a young age.  Some may have abusive family or may be adopted and not know a lot of their family or they may be estranged from family.   There's actually a lot reasons a kid may not be comfortable presenting this kind of project and to refuse to have alternatives for those kids is pretty narrow minded", "NTA. If an 11 y/o boy is that embarrassed by his family tree then clearly she should have looked into it. It\u2019s not about accountability, he did literally everything she asked except present his embarrassment to the class. She should have given him at least something for turning it in but definitely not full credit. For everyone saying \u201cY T A\u201d or \u201cgo to the teacher next time\u201d literally the teacher would have given her a hard time and probably would have denied her son a better grade. Teacher sounds like she needs to learn a little sympathy and not be such a hard ass on 11 year olds.", "NTA - If the presentation portion was 100% of the grade, why would it matter if he copied something from online? If it matters whether the tree is his own work, then why didn't he get credit for that part? \n\nYou could have gone to the teacher first, but it sounds like your son was proactive in speaking up for himself and had already suggested all of the alternatives that would have been reasonable within the teacher's parameters and the teacher shot them down. I doubt the teacher would have reacted any differently if you had made those suggestions and you still would have ended up going to the principal.", "NTA- You made a decision to have a group discussion with the administrators and teacher. Probably not a poor decision given that the teacher was already defensive regarding the zero.\nThere was obviously something wrong with the assignment, if the principal felt it needed to be handled differently. \nAs for the people calling you an A H because you made them change his grade\u2026 that is not factual. You asked for a review of the assignment and the grade. You stated the reasons behind your child\u2019s unwillingness to participate in the presentation. It is the principle that made the teacher change the grade. You stood up for your kid, good for you. You didn\u2019t teach him entitlement. You taught him conviction and you taught him that you will have his back when he is right.", "NTA, I would absolutely hate to do a family tree for an assignment. That's like a teacher asking me to shame myself in front of the class. I'm glad the principal told her to reformat the assignment.", "NTA! You\u2019re awesome! You advocated not only for your child, but for any other child who may have trauma or privacy concerns regarding the family history. \n\nI was targeted and bullied once in a writing class as an adult because I refused to reveal personal information about my family. NO ONE has the right to force me to talk about that. No one.", "NTA and I agree that the correct response, at the very least, to seeing your son struggle would have been to reach out to you and let you know what was going on. Her lack of empathy and prioritizing being right do not paint her in a good light", "Yeah no you are NTA at all.\n\nFamily tree exercises still exist? I would think teachers would be mature enough to realise not everyone has a perfect family, or a family at all.\n\nYou imo handled it perfectly. The teacher, telling you to not go through the principal, yet being agressive instead of understanding shows she took no accountability for that. Just one of those people.\n\nYeah, you prolly should have contacted the teacher first, but given her attitude she showed later, it wouldn't have made a difference in hindsight.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s 2022 and teachers are still pulling this shit with family tree projects. There are SO MANY issues with projects like this, and the publicizing makes it ten times worse. You are an excellent parent for standing up for your kid on this one\u2014and if it was so important to the teacher that you contact her directly, she should have done so in the first place once giving your child a zero.", "NTA. These types of assignments really do need to be treated with mindfulness. We're well aware by now how many children come from all types of backgrounds and asking them to present personal information about themselves and their families without offering a reasonable alternative - like doing a historical figure's family tree as your son suggested - is really not okay. Maybe some kids don't want to share that they're adopted, or that their brother is a known criminal, or they're not comfortable with having a blended family, or so many other possibilities.\n\nIf your son wasn't eleven though, I would've suggested he make it all up and use the Targaryen family wreath as inspiration.", "NTA. As a former foster parent this assignment would have put me through the roof. It's not a good assignment. And no one needs to think too long or hard to figure out why.\n\nAnd the teacher set the precedent on the communication. If I were your child's teacher and they were adamant against presenting I would have reached out to the parents to find out why.\n\nHonestly, this teacher sounds incredibly obtuse. The fact that they also questioned their own Principal as to why the assignment is inappropriate shows that pretty clearly.", "NTA, you did good. It's a problematic assignment and the teacher should have known this. After your son didn't want to do it on his own family, she didn't realise that there was a problem. Not even after he refused to present it but still emailed it, she did not understand the problem. She went as far as punishing him with a zero.\nA bad teacher. You definately did good to include the principal.", "NTA, at all. Whether or not the teacher was within her rights to give a poor grade is kind of beside the point. (Even though I think she clearly shouldn\u2019t have given a 0.) For something like this, where the student has obviously tried to do the assignment but is uncomfortable for one reason or another, she should have reached out to you before giving a 0. So, you had a reason to be upset\u2026 and I\u2019m not sure why she thinks you should have reached out directly to her when she didn\u2019t give you the same courtesy.", "NTA. Good! For! You!\n\nI was prepared to say Y because I assumed this was a classic case of helicoptering/karening (helikarening?), but you are right on target and a wonderful advocate for your child. I\u2019m surprised and glad the principal saw reason and can make this a teachable moment for the teacher. Sounds like she needs some additional training. \n\nAlso, as much as we\u2019re addicted to drama, no we really don\u2019t need to know what was on that tree. So settle down y\u2019all.", "NTA. Oooooh man ngl as someone who's mom and husband are both teachers I was entirely prepared to give the opposite judgement based on the title. Family tree assignments are so problematic though. They can even be really harmful to kids if there's some sort of family trauma or cases of abuse or for any number of other reasons. And then forcing the kids to present those details to the whole class? Yeah no. Even relatively common things like divorce can open a kid up to bullying. Teachers should know better. I think you handled the situation very well OP.\n\nETA: going over someone's head to their boss isn't the nicest way to deal with an issue, but in this case I think it was warranted. She brushed off your son's concerns and refused the very reasonable accommodation he asked for. That's worth taking to the principal in this case.", "NTA\n\nI am a teacher. You did the right thing. The teacher isn\u2019t taking into consideration how this assignment could impact someone who is adopted, who lost a parent and can\u2019t ask them, or for any other reason someone might not be able to access this information. The idea to do a historical figure was a good one and, honestly, should have been offered to students from the start. Hopefully this teacher will make that modification for future classes.", "NTA I thought you were gotta suck but it\u2019s not fair to force any child to talk about their family. There are so many reasons this could cause upset and distress beyond just embarrassment. What if someone had a recent death or had to speak about an abuser in their family. A family tree should only ever be an optional assignment for a child. I can\u2019t imagine not given a child that young an alternative assignment if they asked for a fair accommodation. I do this for university students when appropriate so why not an 11 year old", "**NTA!** I was ready to say you were the ass because I detest when parents get involved unnecessarily because they don't like their child's grade. However, it sounds like your child did everything he could to mitigate his struggle with the assignment and to meet the requirements still. This particular teacher seems too defensive and not in tune with her students.\n\n\"...not try to blame everyone else when there's a problem.\" My response would have been, \"We're not blaming everyone else. We're laying the blame directly on you You caused this with your inflexibility and poor communication. Do better!\"\n\nIf the teacher had pulled that after meeting crap with me, we would have been marching right back into the principal's office to discuss appropriate communication.\n\nEdit to add judgment", "NTA\n\nYour son did everything right.  He talked to the teacher about alternatives and gave her what he could.  She decided to be a shit teacher and not look at the issues he had.  He wasn't refusing to present.  He refused to present his personal information.", "NTA.\n\nThere are so many legitimate reasons a kid might not want to share his family tree that I'm shocked the teacher is still that clueless.\n\nAnd if the teacher gives the kid a zero after he made his concerns clear, asked for an alternative option, and sent her his work--without contacting mom--then I see no reason for mom to try to contact her, as this teacher clearly isn't interested in open communication for the benefit of the child.", "NTA\n\nTeachers are not infallible, unquestionable pillars of knowledge. \n\nSounds like you had a reasonable concern/request and went about it the correct. Way.", "NTA based off the title I was prepared to go the opposite but you did everything right here. This is a \"privileged\" assignment to give out to the class, whether through adoption, family drama or whatever. This is an assignment that could make many feel uncomfortable which is why the principle's scrapping it. \n\nFor those saying that you should've gone to the teacher 1st, I typically would agree but with how reluctant your son was. Reaching out multiple times to discuss the assignment, and she did not get in touch with you. & how resistant she was in the meeting you clearly went with the best course of action.", "Ok\u2026so, I understand the look up and copy aspect.  However, he made the tree she wanted, but she also wanted a presentation. Well, **she** should have suggested he present a historical figure\u2019s tree, and just give her the actual one.\n\nBut, seriously, suppose he didn\u2019t *have* any of the information?  Principal was right.", "NTA. The assignment is inappropriate and frankly ignorant. What does she tell students who were adopted without knowledge of their family history to do? She should have given alternatives for everyone to be able to participate safely. If she couldn't consider that not everyone would be comfortable with this assignment even after seeing his work, going to her supervisor makes total sense. I agree with everyone saying your son will be massively impacted by seeing you stand up for him. My parents stood up for me against a shitty teacher and it's not something I will forget. Great job parent \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\n> She said I needed to teach my son accountability\n\nAccountability?\n\nHe accepted the zero. \n\n> and not try to blame everyone else when there's a problem. \n\nThis was an inappropriate assignment. No student should be forced to reveal personal information for a grade. And your son was smart by offering a solution that he felt comfortable presenting (doing a fictional family tree could be fun too) it was the teacher that rejected it.\n\nMaybe the teacher needs to accept her own accountability for a bad assignment. Should you have gone to the teacher first? Maybe; but I don\u2019t think it makes you an asshole for going to the principal.", "I fucking hate the family tree assignment. What about the adopted kids? Are they going to get in trouble for not presenting \u201cblood\u201d relatives or those who have caregivers step in to fill a parental role? This assignment never goes down well for multiple kids. Thank you for speaking up because it was honestly the worst having to do this as a kid. NTA", "I\u2019ve been under the impression that a lot of districts had phased out assignments like this, similar to how they don\u2019t have students make Mother\u2019s and Father\u2019s Day cards as much anymore. I know my child would have had a difficult time explaining the situation to the teacher, who also doesn\u2019t sound like she would have accepted anything less than every single identifiable detail about why he was uncomfortable, and may have felt weird bringing it to my attention as well. \n\nHaving said that, I fell that you\u2019re NTA in this situation. As much as it probably would have been preferable to speak directly to the teacher and not go to the principal, it sounds like it wouldn\u2019t have gone well. The teacher showed no compassion after the fact and doubling down the way she did was inappropriate.", "NTA, family trees are problematic assignments and shouldn't be part of any curriculum.  Families have many different ways of forming, so the \"traditional\" family tree isn't feasible for many people.", "NTA. Family history should be private and not be forced out in front of a classroom. Also\u2026 i feel like this was the right thing to do especially if the principal thought this project needed to be reformatted", "NTA. Good on you for backing your son. As for the teacher asking you to contact her directly in the future\u2026hell nah! Your son did the tree and emailed it to her. She could have discussed the issue with him and then got him to present it to her one-to-one so he wouldn\u2019t have to be embarrassed or called you to talk about it. Principal was definitely the right person to speak to and now hopefully other children won\u2019t have to suffer with the same issue.", "NTA  Semi-retired teacher here.  \n\n\nDuring my first student teacher assignment in '83, my mentor told me that the school used to give kids a family tree assignment but stopped after a parent became upset - the school was a Catholic school and the parent was divorced.  \n\n\nFor that reason, I have never issued 'Draw up your family tree' as an assignment.", "NTA. It feels icky that my younger kids could \"out\" their eldest sibling as being their half sibling, and unfair. \n\nLike that's her issue to share with her peers. Not her siblings.\n\nOr kids not knowing who dad is.\n\nAlso its not like the teacher showed anyone how to incorporate foster families, non nuclear house holds etc.q", "NTA family trees are bullshit assignments. Not everyone has/wants contact with their extended family. I don't know most of mine and I don't care to. Had to do a family tree assignment when I was 13. My grandfather on my mother's side was a foreign exchange student from Egypt back in the 60s and has no idea he even has a child here in the dates. We only have a first name for him. Teacher knocked points off because \"somebody HAD to have more information on him\" I just didn't try", "NTA I have problematic family history myself. In this assignment alone, the teacher lacked foresight. \n\nExamples:\nAssault resulting in a child.\nSlavery in the family history, where there is no information. \nAdopted children.\nBroken family where no information is given at all about one parent. \nFamilies where a sperm donor was used.\nDeath, often tragic in the family.\nWhere a direct ancestor was a criminal or a murderer.\nWhere family members (cousins) marry and produce offspring.\nLastly, where a family member is famous through no fault of the child for any reason.\nAlso, children of severely broken homes or foster care situations. \n\nI am certain there are more reasons for a child not wanting to present a family tree. The teacher was less than stellar in this case.", "NTA. Your kid did the tree as required and offered to do a tree and presentation on someone well known in order to not present his own information. The teacher seems to have a problem with understanding that not everyone is proud of their ancestors and that there can be negative consequences of revealing who your ancestors are. What was her plan if she has a foster child with no access to their family history?", "My foster sibling had a similar assignment and my mother went nuclear. The teacher also couldn't see anything wrong with the assignment because nobody else had issues with it. I don't know the story of how it went down but I know sibling ended up getting 100% even though she skipped parts of the assignment.", "NTA. When I was 15, my Spanish teacher had us make these memorial things for Dios de los Muertos about someone who passed. He also offered an alternative assignment that was not death-related, no questions asked. This was in the six weeks between when it was clear my grandfather was dying and when he died, I think before my mom told my teachers. Almost 15 years later and it still means the world to me and is one of the reasons I consider him a great teacher.", "NTA and since they will reformat this assignment  you talking probably will help future students avoiding problems with it.", "NTA, and honestly, I\u2019m so over these family tree assignments.  Not everyone can do them and teachers need to be aware of that and have something in place for children who may be adopted, who don\u2019t know their biological family tree, etc.  I had to do one in high school and actually *couldn\u2019t* because it required taking photos of dead ancestors to compare your features to.  The problem was that my maternal line is wholly indigenous.  We only have photos of my kokum (my mum\u2019s mum) and memories of kokum\u2019s *okawimaw*, and the only thing we know about my mum\u2019s biological father is that he was indigenous too and abandoned them.  Almost everyone else in my maternal family was dead due to complications arising from being in residential schools and the resulting trauma (drugs, alcohol, and one aunt was murdered and is among the MMIW).  At the time we had no photos handy.\n\nI explained this to the teacher and asked if perhaps I could trace my dad\u2019s family back an extra few generations to make up for it, as my great-grandmother on my dad\u2019s side was *meticulous* with records and kept very detailed ones of everyone up until she died around the same time this assignment was released, so I had photos going back to the 1800s, all labelled.  \n\nThe teacher said no,  threatened to fail me, and wouldn\u2019t offer any compromise.  I took it up the chain because it was unfair, not everyone has perfect ancestors with pristine photos and not everyone is lucky enough to even know who their biological parents and grandparents may be, and my parents got involved and the principal came down on the teacher, and though she told me I didn\u2019t have to do the assignment, she took it out on my sibling when they landed in her class.  Subsequent family members who came through her class also got treated poorly and ended up switching classes.\n\nSo if you have any other kids just be wary of that, OP.  If this teacher is going to do assignments like this, the principal is right: she needs to change it.", "NTA", "NTA. It doesn't take a college degree to figure out why a child might be embarrassed by their family tree, especially once its been emailed to her. The teacher had drawn an arbitrary line in the sand that was unreasonable. My son has his own wee things going on & part of his English grade is a presentation - the teacher offered for it just to be done to her. I'm not saying that would've worked here but a little flexibility when you can see a child is trying goes a long way. He did the work. Id have went over her head as well.", "NTA he did all the work, you are right in thinking the presentation shouldn't be 100% of the grade. The teacher lacked common sense and compassion in thus case.", "NTA\n\nI'll admit I came into this thinking you would be but this teacher is really outrageous and then has the nerve to tell you not to go to her superior. She definitely feels that you went over her head, and rightfully so. I don't feel like she was listening to your concerns and her grading for an 11 year old is ridiculous. I think teachers need to realize that there are students who would not be comfortable presenting, let alone presenting something that they didn't feel comfortable doing at all. The fact that he handed in anything shows he cares, and that should have been enough for the teacher, especially after he had alredy expressed this to her!", "NTA. Your son tried to do the right thing - he asked to do the family tree about someone else, and when this was denied, he did the work but refused to present it. It was clear that he wasn't comfortable discussing some of his relatives in class.\n\nIt's fine for your son to have this concern, and it seems as though he made a reasonable attempt to discuss it with the teacher.\n\nThe teacher just blew him off. She is the problem.", "NTA.\n\nI am really into genealogy. I can trace my ancestors back six generations in all directions. Thanks to DNA I know that my grandmother\u2019s grandmother was not the biological daughter of the man named on her birth certificate.\n\nMany people are not in my situation. There are children who have zero contact with their parents for very good reasons. There are many children who do not know who their fathers were. There are some who do not know who their mothers were. There are some who know perfectly well who their biological parents and grandparents are, and have very good reasons not to want to share that information with anyone.\n\nThe teacher\u2019s assignment was utterly unprofessional, and her attitude to being called out on it was worse. You were right, the principal is right and most of all your son is right. I hope that this teacher finds another line of work to which she is better suited.", "NTA.   Learning to stand up and deliver presentations is an important life skill.  So I can see where the teacher is coming from.

I saw my son had a zero on an assignment and confronted him. He didn't want to tell me why he had a zero, but I insisted. He admitted the assignment was a family tree he was supposed to present to the class but refused to.\n\nHe told me he asked his teacher if he could do his tree on someone else, like a historical figure. The teacher said no, that most historical figures and celebrities have family trees online he would be able to copy. My son did the tree for our family, but he refused to present it. He emailed the tree to his teacher instead. However, the teacher said the assignment was to make and present a tree, and her grading rubric was based on the presentation, so if he didn't present he would get a zero.\n\nI was pretty upset. You expect your kids to not always be upfront with you, but why on earth didn't this teacher contact me when she realized this assignment was problematic for him? And why didn't she grade his work? Why is the presentation 100% of the grade? I would think a complete tree, if done correctly, is at least worth a C.\n\nI contacted the principal to explain my concerns and ask for a meeting. I had the meeting with the principal, teacher and guidance councilor. The teacher explained her reasoning, and I said that my son's embarrassment over some of his family members shouldn't impact his grade. He shouldn't have to choose between exposing himself to his peers and a poor grade.\n\nThe principal asked to see the tree my son emailed to the teacher as well as the grading rubric. The principal said she didn't like the assignment and told the teacher to reformat it if she wanted to use it in future years. She also said she would grade the tree and have the assignment grade changed. The teacher protested, asking what the issue it with her assignment. The principal said they would talk about it after I left.\n\nAs I was leaving the teacher asked me to contact her directly in the future when I have a concern. I explained that I didn't feel comfortable doing so, because of her actions and failure to communicate with me when the problem first arose. She tried to blame my son, but I pointed out that she is the professional and he is eleven. She said I needed to teach my son accountability and not try to blame everyone else when there's a problem. I was mad, so I left before I could say something mean. I know she thinks I'm an asshole because now her assignment has to change, but I feel she brought this on herself.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The fact she didn\u2019t reach out to you when there were signs that the reason he didn\u2019t want to present were *because* of who he was doing the project on is shocking to say the least.

I understand a teacher\u2019s autonomy in their own classroom but it\u2019s clear this one was trying to sneak something under the radar and you caught her. I thought that teachers had to get their assignments approved by administration before using them in class- it\u2019s possible that she didn\u2019t for this one and used it anyway. Her asking you to contact her directly after this instead of the principal would also make me uncomfortable as it feels like she\u2019s trying to manipulate the situation.
