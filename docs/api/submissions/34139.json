She is a trans woman and I am a bi man (this helps with context later on). \n\nSo to start off; me and my girlfriend have been through rough patches. We\u2019ve cheated on one another very early on in our relationship.

We worked on ourselves and after some time apart we decided that we should be together again. We decided to rebuild a happy relationship built on trust and not betrayal like what we had previously. \n\nFlash-forward to the present. We live together still, we work, and I tend to enjoy video games in my free time. I play with friends. Online friends that I have met (typically from games like Overwatch and Dead by Daylight). Usually my free time intercepts her work schedule and when she gets off of work I\u2019m usually on the game with my friends. My friends tend to be members of the LGBTQ (same as I and my girlfriend). My girlfriend works from home. So she tends to get off of work and then come straight to the room. When she gets back into the room I feel bad if I continue playing the game. After a long day of work I\u2019m sure she just wants to kick back and cuddle for the remainder of the night. But I\u2019m mistaken. She starts yelling at me, accusing me of leaving because I was flirting with my friends and since my friend was a gay man I was obviously trying to be sneaky. I didn\u2019t even leave automatically, I finished the remainder of the match I was currently in. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, or flirting with anyone. I\u2019m scared she has the wrong idea and just doesn\u2019t trust me because of it. She said I got too defensive and that\u2019s the only reason why she was upset.

There are a couple things going on here:\n\n1) She has obvious trust issues in regard to you talking to others. This is probably linked to the previous online flirting but given that she actually slept with someone in retaliation she can\u2019t really throw stones.\n\n2) Someone that has cheated before is typically going to expect that behavior from the person they\u2019re in a relationship with.\n\n3) There\u2019s also the fact that the person doing the accusing is often (not always) guilty of doing what they\u2019re accusing the other of having done.\n\nYou can try to tough it out, relationship counseling is always an option, or you can get out. Without outside intervention I don\u2019t think that she\u2019ll improve and she\u2019s likely to keep accusing you of cheating on her. It\u2019s ultimately up to you and you need to do what\u2019s emotionally best for yourself.", "NTA. Run. This relationship started with a breach of trust and you both will never actually trust each other. Obviously you flirting online is horrible thing to do when your in a relationship but the fact that her reaction to that is to hook up with another guy is equally if not more horrible. She doesn't trust you and is being very irrational in this particular situation. This is not a good relationship and you could try to fix it with relationship counseling but in my personal opinion get out of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What is her response to that? If you've explained it and she still doesn't trust your reason(s), sounds like some relationship counseling would be helpful."]}
