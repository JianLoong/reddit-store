{"id": 32761, "submission_id": "18fap16", "title": "AITA for not returning home for my fiancee when she was locked outside of the house?", "selftext": "It\u2019s a nice Sunday afternoon. My plan is to walk to my sister\u2019s house (an hour away) and watch my football team play live on television. It\u2019ll be dark once the game finishes, so I\u2019ll take an Uber back. We don\u2019t have cars and are also trying to save money (wedding to pay for and much more). My fiancee plans to stay at our home, read, relax, watch TV. \n\nSo I make the walk to my sister\u2019s. After about forty minutes there - and about twenty minutes into the game - I get a call from my fiancee. She\u2019s in tears and has accidentally locked herself out of the house while picking up a food delivery to the home. She wants me to come back and use my key to let her in the house. \n\nMy first job is to calm her down. Then I have to convince her not to try and break our side door down so she can get in. Then a solution occurs to me. I tell her to take an uber to my sister\u2019s. Then, I\u2019ll uber us both back home in an hour when the game is over. That way my fiancee is not locked outside in the cold and I still get to watch the game. She doesn\u2019t want to do this. There\u2019s no real reason why besides her just not wanting to. She wants to carry on with her evening plans in our home. I don\u2019t force the issue. I express that I want to stay and watch the game and my solution works for everyone, but it\u2019s her choice. I\u2019ll come if she insists on not coming. Otherwise, she can come here for an hour until we go back together. \n\nShe eventually take an uber to join me at my sister\u2019s. We watch the match for another 45 minutes then I call us an uber back home. The whole time, she\u2019s annoyed at me, barely speaking to me.  She thinks I should have simply came back to ours when she called, stop what I wanted to do that evening to amend her mistake. My contention is: my solution was the best of both worlds! The way we did it, she was not locked outside of the house in the cold AND my whole plans for the night weren\u2019t scuppered. \n\nI basically feel like she\u2019s expressing is: \u2018what I wanted to do that night is more important than what you wanted.\u2019 And what\u2019s more, i don\u2019t see how she can have an issue with the solution we came to: her coming to my sister\u2019s for an hour then us going home together. It\u2019s not like we got home late. It was 6pm. The uber one-way is cheap too. So Reddit, SHOULD I have gone straight back home when she called?

She only had to be at your sisters for like 45 minutes and then you got back home. \n\nUnless there\u2019s any reason like she doesn\u2019t like your sister or she was anxious about like having left something like a candle on in the house \u2026 then she just sounds a bit dramatic", "INFO\n\nHonestly, this one is about patterns.\n\nIf my low-maintenance non-demanding grateful partner asks for me to come and let her in the house, yes absolutely. She's asking for a favour and I will oblige.\n\nIf things tend to happen every time I leave the house, or if my partner  wouldn't do the same for me if the roles were reversed, or if she didn't ask for a favour but made a demand, then no.\n\nThe alternative solution I would have proposed is for her to uber to pick up my keys and let herself in.", "Info: why couldn't she uber over to your sister's house, pick up your keys, then uber herself home? That way she wouldn't have to wait for the game to finish. I'm genuinely so confused about this.", "NTA. You did offer to come home if she insisted.\n\nFiancee's plans were messed up either way, and she'd have been waiting outdoors in the cold longer if she insisted on you coming back\n\nFiancee is angry at herself at least as much as at you, but she's taking it all out on you, which is not okay.", "She's the one who created the problem and therefore dealing with the inconvenience it is her burden, not your burden, given that there's an easy solution.  Her demanding that it's your burden, you're the one who ought to lose out because of the problem she created, and then pouting when you don't give in, is not mature behavior.\n\nNTA", "We keep a secret key buried in a secret place. I suggest you do the same. This happens and next time she is out of town and you have to call a locksmith.", "NTA\nYou provided an equitable solution AND told her that you\u2019ll come if she insists.\n\nIt\u2019s not YOUR fault she locked herself out.  That was a big ask on her part.\n\nWhy is it on you to suffer the consequences of her mistake when she can easily come to you and return with you.", "NTA. And all those saying otherwise are bonkers.", "I see this as what you were prepared to do for her. You weren\u2019t prepared to interrupt your plans to help her out when she needed you. It\u2019s about the gesture. She unfortunately locked herself out and was really upset about it. If you look at it in pure I\u2019m right, she\u2019s wrong terms, you are not TA but you failed to take an opportunity to show her that you\u2019ll be there for her when she needs you. It might not be completely rational but I would feel let down by you if I were her. Hope the game was worth it.", "Now you know to hide a key or get a keypad lock for your door.", "NTA. She was careless with her keys so she created the problem. You provided a reasonable solution that she ended up accepting. So she should let it go and get on with her life. Her position - that you should have returned immediately - is somewhat spoiled and entitled.", "NTA, however - the next time you need something, I'd say no.  My fianc\u00e9 would never do this to me nor I to him.", "NTA\u2026 this is  a problem she created for herself, unfortunate. You gave her a solution you even said you would fold if she didn\u2019t. You made the walk to your sisters, paid for an additional Uber getting her to your sisters place.", "Info: your plans were to watch TV. Did your fianc\u00e9e have time sensitive plans she needed to be in the house for?", "NTA, how is it fair for her to wanna have her plans in tact  and undisturbed but fine for yours to be disturbed and revolve around her day? I would suggest sitting her down and talking to her and tell her how you feel and that you find it unfair that it\u2019s either her way or the highway.", "NTA - why didn\u2019t she Uber, collect your keys and Uber home immediately?", " \"I express that I want to stay and watch the game and my solution works for everyone, but it\u2019s her choice.  I'll come if she insists on not coming. \"\n\n\nSorry, YTA here.\n\nTo be clear, this solution worked for you. It clearly didn't work for her.  Sure her Ubering back home by herself, would have increased the cost of \"your solution\" by a third (the evening going from 2 Uber trips to 3), but it actually had the advantage of truly working for everyone.   She didn't want an evening watching the game at your sister's house.   She wanted a quiet night at home.  Was the idea to punish her for her mistake by depriving her of the quiet night at homeshe planned? If not, why couldn't she Uber to you, where you run out and meet the car, and then she could Uber right back?\n\nYou saying that \"you'll come if she insists on not coming\" is pretty emotionally manipulative and seems designed to guilt her into going along with your plan....especially if she tends to be more emotional of the two of you (which she seems to be).", "NTA on offering solution, though as for whether you /should/ have gone... Well, that's for you and your fiancee to sort out the ramifications of. I hope this will be a moment the two of you can look back and laugh about further down the line.\n\nDo wanna add to your line about \"best of both worlds\" including that /your/ plans for the evening didn't get altered sort of glosses over that your fiancee's plans definitely did by nature of her having to go with your suggestion.\n\nI'm very curious as to how exactly your wife locked herself out of the house. You say she was picking up food delivery to the house? As in she had to go get take-away, or as in she stepped out to the curb and the door closed and locked behind her? And where were her own keys?\n\nEither way, based on responses in comments you seem to genuinely love and care about her and this situation could simply be chalked up to an honest mistake. You could have made the sacrifice of cutting the game-watching short, especially since games usually have reruns, at the same time it's not like you utterly ignored your beloved or her situation either.\n\nCouldn't hurt to have an open talk about it with her to clear the air though (if you haven't already). Best of luck with the wedding!", "YTA You spend a lot of time in your post emphasizing that this was the perfect plan because *it works for everyone*. Whether you agree with her reasons or not, this did not work for your fianc\u00e9e. It\u2019s scary how your fianc\u00e9e has literally told you that your plan doesn\u2019t work for her and yet you insist that it does. Try putting your listening ears on.", "I'm surprised by all the N T As here. I understand that this is a situation she created herself but it was an honest mistake. You had an opportunity to show your future life partner how reliable you are and decided to put yourself above her needs. Her being locked out in the cold is scary and when she went to you for help you said no I don't want to help just come to where I am and we will resolve it when I want.\n\nYou said you feel she\u2019s expressing \"what I wanted to do that night is more important than what you wanted\" but I think you put what you wanted ahead of her feeling cared for. I don't know your relationship, you have only shown a snapshot but based on this moment YTA.\n\nI understand that looking at this in a transactional way she made the mistake so you shouldn't be put out by it. But I'd have thought that kind of logic works with acquaintances and distant friends. I'd have thought you would be more willing to put in the effort for your fiancee. There will be times you want something that's inconvenient to her but you have set the precedent where you look out for yourself first. It's your relationship and as I said we have only seen this snapshot but I think its better to be happy than right.", "NTA.  You both had different plans for the evening , so one of you is going to be unhappy with the solution.  She messed up by locking herself out so she is the one that she live with the plan.", "I vote YTA, you were watching a game and someone was locked out of the house in the cold!  Just go home. Why make her Uber all the way to you and then Uber back. Plus you can\u2019t be that short of money if that was your solution.  Must be a lot of sports fans for you to get so many NTA.", "INFO: Do you even like your fianc\u00e9e?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real reason why besides her just not wanting to.\u201d\n\nDoes she get along well with your sister? Was anyone else there? If so, how does she get along with them?\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re an A-H, but I do think you treated your fianc\u00e9e more like a roommate than a loved one.  You had an opportunity to show your fianc\u00e9e you care and will be there in an emergency and you blew it. Now she knows better than to rely on you, what a great foundation for your future together.", "Not going to rend judgement because well, you really keep pressing how right you are and your solution was so much better; kind of felt like you were dismissing her.\n\nInvest in a combo/keypad type lock. You never get locked out because you only have to input a 4 digit number.", "Info: do you want to be right or do you want a smooth relationship?", "YTA no offense. Dude she is more important than a football game.  You are about to marry her and you couldnt be bothered to stop what you were doing to make sure she was safe. Your solution worked out for only you. She had to take an uber twice to your sisters and had to wait another 45 minutes so you can finish watching a game that wont even matter in another year. You could have watched the game on your phone in the uber on the way back to your house and watched the game at home.", "ESH - I don\u2019t think you are the asshole, but relationships that last are the ones in which people inconvenience themselves for their partner. Of course the argument could be made that either one of you could have stepped up to accommodate the other, but neither of you did. Probably need to think about whether you and your fianc\u00e9 are really marriage material.", "Look up a local locksmith, call the locksmith, get the locksmith to go round and let your girlfriend in. If it's a local business and a simple lockout, it probably cost less than an Uber.\n\nLook, I see how irritating it is that your plans for the afternoon get disrupted because your girlfriend made a mistake. But it's still f\\*\\*king irritating to get locked out of the house and then have the person you call not be interested in helping you. Because telling her to come over to where you are **is** pretty definitely telling her \"not helping\".  And if this was  a housemate, a fellow lodger, a tenant, I'd say you had every right to avoid being inconvenienced or put to the expense of a locksmith for her mistake.\n\nBut in theory, you're  the person she planned to spend the rest of her life with. I'm going with YTA because it's really not a great idea to tell the person you wanted to marry that you have zero interest in helping her when she got themselves locked out of your home due to a mistake. And like I said: taking the time to call a local locksmith would actually have been *helpful.*", "Why didn't you just call an Uber to take the keys to your fiance while you stayed and watched the match? They don't care. They get paid regardless.", "Your intended had a phone. She could have called a locksmith and handled it like an adult. \n\nAny way it might go down, somebody was going to be inconvenienced, it might as well have been the person that locked themselves out of their own home, not *you*. \n\nOh, the horror, your intended ended up joining you at your sisters house for a little while-and pouted the whole time. Yay, let\u2019s hear it for mature behavior! (s)\n\nHave you thought about hiding an extra key outside to avoid drama in the future? NTA", "YTA 1) Why in the world don\u2019t you have an extra key hidden outside in case this happens? 2) I would be highly irritated if you weren\u2019t willing to come home and help out. You could\u2019ve watched the game later on YouTube. 3) See # 1 and 2.", "YTA an hour walk is about a 10 minute drive with uber. If it's so cheap uber home let her in uber back and watch your game. You would have lost 20 Minutes.Instead you only gave her the option to lose her time for herself completely and watch a game she probably doesn't care about.\n\nI would have broken the side door if I was her if you just don't come when I call.  \n\n\nHell my parents live hours away and would meet me in the middle to give me my spare key.", "You ATA.  \n\n\nThe game is more important than your fiancee?  \nGood luck with the rest of that relationship, however much longer it lasts.  \nYou could have Uber'd home, unlocked the door and gone back.", "NAH  almost decided everyone was an ass, but since I could argue either way figured that made it neutral. I don\u2019t see anything egregious on either side. It rattled the fianc\u00e9 to be locked out, it does not matter why it hit her hard. Some things just hit harder  than others. Assuming OP\u2019s details are correct  they gave more than 1 option and made efforts to calm fianc\u00e9 down. Op did also want to preserve their night , so did the fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 \u2018s night got screwed and now she\u2019s pissed. Not mature, but understandable. I don\u2019t think this is a who\u2019s right situation, I think it\u2019s take the opportunity for everyone to learn communication skills situation.", "You are not in the wrong. She is for locking herself out and then demanding you interrupt your plans to accommodate her stupidity. Your solution was actually pretty good. Tell her in the future to put two door keys in her purse.", "NTA.   She made a mistake and her plans were ruined.    That's not your fault.   If she needed to be home to cram for an exam or work on a work project then I would say otherwise but your solution worked and hopefully next time she gets food delivered she remembers what happened here and doesn't lock herself out again", "NAH - this one was tough because tbh I see the logic for you going to her and her coming to you. It would have been very nice of you to just quickly Uber to her but it doesn\u2019t make you an AH for not doing that. I also can see her being upset that you were not supportive. \n\nSo are you an AH, no. But, yeah for the sake of your relationship you probably should have gone to her instead.", "NTA\n\nPresumably it's still light at this point... to really make a point you could say that you'll start walking now and you'll see her in an hour to let her in.  Or she could uber herself to your sisters and be home in an hour anyway.  \n\nYou had quite a good solution while not sacrificing yourself.  Especially as she seems to be a good friend of your sister.", "So the game was more important to you than your fianc\u00e9e?  Gotcha.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. Your fiance is an adult and was apparently in no real danger. Your solution was one of many and seems quite reasonable. Alternatively, she could have walked to a friend's house, or a coffee shop if she really didn't want to go to your sister's.\n\nYou should invest in a keyless entry system, or leave a key with family/friends nearby in case of future lockouts,", "YTA.  \n\n1)  Your fiance called you because she was locked out of the house and needed your help to get back in.  Your first priority was to go watch the game.  That's not a healthy ordering of priorities when you are in a relationship.  \n\n2)  Your attempted \"compromise,\" again, had the primary goal of letting you watch the game.  Secondarily, you tried to impose this \"compromise\" on your partner, rather than attempt to reach an actual compromise through mutual discussion.", "Reasonable compromise, even if it won't warn you any points. Lol", "NTA.\n\nBut stop pretending that your solution was the best for everyone.  It was the best for you.", "NTA. I literally thought, why doesn\u2019t she Uber to you, and then that is exactly what you suggested.", "INFO: is she mad at you, or just frustrated and disappointed that she didn\u2019t get to have the night she wanted? You got to have your night. She didn\u2019t (through no fault of yours - that\u2019s just how the cookie crumbled).", "NAH - She made a mistake, you presented a reasonable solution. Sounds like there should be a hide-a-key someplace to avoid this problem.", "NTA, but let\u2019s be clear here: your solution was not the best of both worlds. No such solution existed as far as I can tell.\n\nBasically, you had two options:\n1. Cancel your plans so she didn\u2019t have to cancel hers.\n2. Have her cancel her plans so you didn\u2019t have to cancel yours.\n\nAll else being equal, the chivalrous thing to do would be option #1. In the situation where it was her fault this choice came up, option #1 becomes extra chivalrous, but it seems unchivalrous of her to hold it against you.", "I think YTA just a bit here. I've locked myself out several times and I get extremely stressed and anxious about the whole thing.\n\nThis isn't about logic, its about your fiance feeling supported in a time of need, not just this one time but in the future. I would be freaking out and thinking that if I needed your help or support in the future, you wouldn't be there for me if I was in her position. If you're hoping to have kids, she's probably panicking and wondering what will happen if the gets locked out with the kids, will she have to sit in the cold with the kids.\n\nYou've also said in the thread that if she had ubered out you wouldn't have wanted her to uber back. She will already know this. It would have taken no more than 10 minutes out of your time watching the match.", "Tired of People putting sports above a person!!!! I mean she made a mistake but at the final of the Day you say you love her but you prefer a game of a bunch of men who does not give a fuck about you or anything related to you and they earn millions anyway, that's what my dad used to say to me when i made a big fuss over games when i was a fucking kid, you are a grown ass man Who is going to marry, grow the fuck up, and the funny part is that they lost, LOL im happy for that.", "Technically, you are NTA because your plan was not unreasonable.  But what you did was choose your own needs and comfort over hers in a situation where one or the other was in play.  And, in the end, all you did was show her that you will put your needs above hers.  \n\nIt\u2019s a weird position to be in:  Stop watching the game and go let her in, or keep watching it and have her join you for the last hour.  You could have missed the last hour of the game.  And doing so would have saved her the cost of an Uber.  \n\nMore important than that, it would have shown her that you can be gracious when she needs you.  So, yeah, you escape on a technicality being the asshole.  But it won\u2019t do you any favors in the long run.  \n\nTreat the person you love better than treat anyone else.  What you did would erode my trust in you.", "NTA\n\nHer mistake, she should have fixed it. Maybe leave a spare key with neighbours in future.", "YTA! If watching tv is more important than helping your fianc\u00e9, then break up. You only offered one solution which was you not getting up off your ass.", "ESH for arguing about a little over an hour\u2019s worth of time on the weekend.  You both need to stop being so petty.", "Sounds like she thinks her time is more valuable than yours.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  She created the entire problem. When I'm the one that screws up, I am the one that bears the inconvenience. I have locked myself out (more than once). I've called a locksmith, I've gone thru a window.

Your fianc\u00e9 is selfish.", "NTA, she locked herself out and could just Uber back and forth to your sister. She didn\u2019t even have to wait for you/ the game to end. \n\nThat being said.

I\u2019ve locked myself out in similar circumstances and it would never have occurred to me to ask my husband to cancel his plans to fix my mistake. Rather, I thought of possible solutions based on what everyone else was already doing. Ultimately, I called a locksmith because it was unreasonable to ask my husband to cancel his plans with his brother an hour away or to ask my mother-in-law to drive 45 minutes with a spare key. \n\nGoing forward, we bought a magnetic hide-a-key box to put in an undisclosed location on our property (nowhere near the actual door) and it\u2019s a good thing we did - my husband later locked himself out in cold weather wearing his boxers and a t-shirt while taking the dog out, and neither I nor my MIL were in a position to help.", "So uhh why didn't you just have her call a locksmith??\n\nLike They would have had the door opened in 5 minutes...

Maybe she should start bringing keys when she leaves the house. \n\nHonestly...she knew you were in the middle of something YOU wanted to do without her. You're engaged.

I could totally kill an hour watching reels.", "NTA. You gave her an acceptable option.

My plan is to walk to my sister\u2019s house (an hour away) and watch my football team play live on television. It\u2019ll be dark once the game finishes, so I\u2019ll take an Uber back. We don\u2019t have cars and are also trying to save money (wedding to pay for and much more). My fiancee plans to stay at our home, read, relax, watch TV. \n\nSo I make the walk to my sister\u2019s. After about forty minutes there - and about twenty minutes into the game - I get a call from my fiancee. She\u2019s in tears and has accidentally locked herself out of the house while picking up a food delivery to the home. She wants me to come back and use my key to let her in the house. \n\nMy first job is to calm her down. Then I have to convince her not to try and break our side door down so she can get in. Then a solution occurs to me. I tell her to take an uber to my sister\u2019s. Then, I\u2019ll uber us both back home in an hour when the game is over. That way my fiancee is not locked outside in the cold and I still get to watch the game. She doesn\u2019t want to do this. There\u2019s no real reason why besides her just not wanting to. She wants to carry on with her evening plans in our home. I don\u2019t force the issue. I express that I want to stay and watch the game and my solution works for everyone, but it\u2019s her choice. I\u2019ll come if she insists on not coming. Otherwise, she can come here for an hour until we go back together. \n\nShe eventually take an uber to join me at my sister\u2019s. We watch the match for another 45 minutes then I call us an uber back home. The whole time, she\u2019s annoyed at me, barely speaking to me.  She thinks I should have simply came back to ours when she called, stop what I wanted to do that evening to amend her mistake. My contention is: my solution was the best of both worlds! The way we did it, she was not locked outside of the house in the cold AND my whole plans for the night weren\u2019t scuppered. \n\nI basically feel like she\u2019s expressing is: \u2018what I wanted to do that night is more important than what you wanted.\u2019 And what\u2019s more, i don\u2019t see how she can have an issue with the solution we came to: her coming to my sister\u2019s for an hour then us going home together. It\u2019s not like we got home late. It was 6pm. The uber one-way is cheap too. So Reddit, SHOULD I have gone straight back home when she called?
