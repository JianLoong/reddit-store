I don't think it would kill him to spend time with them. \n\nI told Nick to spend an hour a day with his brothers doing whatever - Legos, helping with homework, taking them to the park, etc. He said he didn't want to. \n\nI reminded him that he essentially had both his mom and I all to himself for a very long time and his brothers will never have that. What they can have is spending time with their Big Brother which is like hanging out with with a celebrity.\n\nHe said he disagreed. So I said that he has an obligation as an older brother.

Requiring that amount of interaction isn't usually viable.\n\nInstead of doing that, why don't you plan FAMILY times during the weekend where the family does a certain activity together.

As your younger sons grow up and mature, their bond will begin to grow stronger with Nick as they\u2019ll be able to relate to one another.

Is there a reason as a parent you can\u2019t fill this mandatory hour? Being 16 is really hard. Not in the way that being an adult is, obviously, but your son is clearly juggling a lot outside of being a \u201ccelebrity\u201d to his younger siblings. My little brother and I didn\u2019t become super close until we were in our 20s and now I consider him the person I trust the most in this world.

The wording. \u201cObligation\u201d? He\u2019s a child. Doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s a teen, he\u2019s still your child. YOU as a parent have an obligation, not him. I remember being 16 and talking with multiple friends about that stupid ass word that it felt like all of our parents would use. At 16 \u201cobligation\u201d feels so fucking arbitrary because it is commonly when you are coming to terms with the fact that you did not consent to come into this world. You feel rebellious against ANY \u201cobligation\u201d because you are 1) just becoming comfortable with your own self autonomy and 2) becoming very aware of the bullshit societal \u201cobligation\u201d that all of us adults have known for years and have grown to ignore.", "Do you want to turn your oldest child against your youngsters - because this approach is excellent if you do. He is 16. He has schoolwork and outsiode interests and you are proposing he spends an hour a day with the siblings. They are much younger and their interests will not align with his. Or are you just after free childcare and dumping on the kid? Either way, YTA. He will resent you, them and then disappear at the earliest opportunity.", "YTA", "Really he doesn't.  It's only when we're older do we wish we'd spent more time with older siblings but not necessarily younger siblings.  There is also a massive age gap there so for your son it's more like he's babysitting them as opposed to spending time with them. He wants to be with his mates which is fair enough.
