I don't think it would kill him to spend time with them. \n\nI told Nick to spend an hour a day with his brothers doing whatever - Legos, helping with homework, taking them to the park, etc. He said he didn't want to. \n\nI reminded him that he essentially had both his mom and I all to himself for a very long time and his brothers will never have that. What they can have is spending time with their Big Brother which is like hanging out with with a celebrity.\n\nHe said he disagreed. So I said that he has an obligation as an older brother.

Requiring that amount of interaction isn't usually viable.\n\nInstead of doing that, why don't you plan FAMILY times during the weekend where the family does a certain activity together.

Is there a reason as a parent you can\u2019t fill this mandatory hour? Being 16 is really hard. Not in the way that being an adult is, obviously, but your son is clearly juggling a lot outside of being a \u201ccelebrity\u201d to his younger siblings. My little brother and I didn\u2019t become super close until we were in our 20s and now I consider him the person I trust the most in this world.

I remember being 16 and talking with multiple friends about that stupid ass word that it felt like all of our parents would use. At 16 \u201cobligation\u201d feels so fucking arbitrary because it is commonly when you are coming to terms with the fact that you did not consent to come into this world. You feel rebellious against ANY \u201cobligation\u201d because you are 1) just becoming comfortable with your own self autonomy and 2) becoming very aware of the bullshit societal \u201cobligation\u201d that all of us adults have known for years and have grown to ignore.", "Do you want to turn your oldest child against your youngsters - because this approach is excellent if you do. He is 16. He has schoolwork and outsiode interests and you are proposing he spends an hour a day with the siblings. They are much younger and their interests will not align with his. Or are you just after free childcare and dumping on the kid? Either way, YTA. He will resent you, them and then disappear at the earliest opportunity.", "YTA", "Really he doesn't.  It's only when we're older do we wish we'd spent more time with older siblings but not necessarily younger siblings.  There is also a massive age gap there so for your son it's more like he's babysitting them as opposed to spending time with them. He wants to be with his mates which is fair enough.

So the days he is not doing sports he should be with peers.\n\n6-7 dinner\n\n7-9 homework\n\n9-10 unwind (I assume the younger siblings are probably in bed by then)\n\nSo where do you propose he fit this hour in?", "YTA. He is way older than his siblings, what do a nine year old and a sis teen year old have in common?

It is not his responsibility to care for them, take then places, spend time with them. That's your job. An hour every day is a lot too.

Does the hour you all spend at dinner count?", "YTA, keep doing this and he'll resent you when he's older.

Unless there's violence or abuse, don't interfere in your kids' relationships with each other. You can't force them to play because YOU want to. Kids are different to one another, and will have different interests. My two sisters and I were 2-3 years apart in age and didn't spend any significant time together from when my eldest sister became a teenager. As adults we have grown pretty close. This is something that siblings figure out on their own, on their own time. You have an obligation to all your kids because you chose to bring them into the world. Your eldest has no obligation towards the younger; he did not choose to have siblings. Ideally you'll have raised them in a home where they learn to love and support one another. But trying to force him this way will do nothing towards helping them get along; you're just causing friction and resentment.", "Wow going against the grain. Nah. It would be good for him and them. An hour is not long. I understand his push back as well, but that\u2019s to be expected. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really enforceable is the issue, unless he really wants to learn to drive or have some other kind of privilege to justify the added \u2018responsibility\u2019 of bonding with his bros.

However, making hanging out with his brothers a daily requirement might not be the best thing. Instead, you should work on having family time once or twice a week, where your whole family is playing games, baking cookies, playing a sport, going on a hike etc. That would be much better than making it a chore and a burden.

This is the dad trying to get his eldest to have a relationship with his brothers. An hour everyday is extreme - but a bit of time each week?

The brother is missing out on a chance to be a positive role model to his brothers. \nMy younger kids have a great relationship with their now adult brother because they hung out together doing stuff like Minecraft and Lego or getting a bit of homework help. At first it took a bit of prodding (he was 15!) but it ended up being an incredible experience for all of them. Now that they\u2019re older they go to concerts and mountain biking together. I they are young now but they grow up so fast. \n\nI think it\u2019s worthy to try to foster this relationship. I started to get my kids together by organizing a family games night twice a week. There are amazing board games out there now, everyone had a blast and had to talk to each other.

He's a teenager he will want to do his own thing. Especially if he now got to have the time for school, socialising and making sure 1 hour a day is playing with them, not that many hours in a day. Can't you say maybe once a week spend an hour with them, and you know if you choose that route maybe he'll enjoy it and not resent it.", "YTA. Or else what? Do you think threatening him will work?", "YTA - your children are not his problem.\n\nAlso, \"or else\".... what? What comes next?", "You know a good way to ensure one sibling wants nothing to do with the other? Force them to spend time together. \n\nI mean come on. I get it in a perfect world siblings would want to spend time together. But he\u2019s 16 and his younger brothers are both under 10. Of course he doesn\u2019t want to spend an hour a day with them. \n\nIf you want the brothers to bond then YOU need to take it upon yourself to organize family outings so they can spend time together in a non demanding way. \n\nYTA for getting mad at a 16 year old for acting like a 16 year old.", "Slight YTA. I totally get where you are coming from, you want all your kids to love and spend time with each other. But forcing it is only going to make him resent them as others have said. I would, however, suggest you have a real conversation with your oldest.\n\nI'm a big sister and my sister and I really didn't get along as we were growing up. Looking back I really regret all the times she wanted to spend time with me and I shirked her. That time building a relationship from childhood with your siblings, you can't get it back. I know that now. \n\nHave a real conversation, but give him the choice ultimately.", "Forcing them together isn't the answer. Nick will be resentful and his brothers will pick up on it and feel awful. Chill out. I'm over 10 years older than my youngest sibling and loved hanging out with her-on my own terms.", "YTA - for the way you phrased it. Your 16yo has ZERO obligation to his younger brothers! You decided to have more children after him, he didn\u2019t chose that. He has no obligation to them at all. What you should be doing is encouraging him to spend time with his siblings in settings he likes. Take them to a game he plays to watch their big brother, some type of kid friendly event that your older son would enjoy. That\u2019s how they can spend time together. You will only make your older son resent his younger brothers by forcing him to participate in activities he isn\u2019t interested in or by telling him he is obligated", "YTA. An hour a day is too much. Let him enjoy being a kid.", "YTA. sorry it\u2019s not your oldest son fault that he had more time alone with his parents. It\u2019s not his fault you put 7 years between him and his siblings. Because of your choices doesn\u2019t make it any different to him if his siblings were 1 apart or 7. I\u2019m a mom with girls 5 years apart with the youngest being 16. I never made it the responsibility of the older one to accommodate the younger. Actually I\u2019m going to call BS because with the age difference I got to spend a lot of time with the youngest while the oldest was in school. And your 2 youngest got to grow up together while the youngest was an only for 7 years.", "Let me speak from experience, you are forcing this kid to resent their siblings and go no/low contact at some point with you. Yta", "YTA. He didn't choose to have brothers; you chose to have sex and have them. You essentially forced him into being an older brother, so why should he be forced into hanging out with his siblings if he'd rather not ? Just because you share the same parents doesn't mean you will automatically gel with someone. Nick not wanting to hang out with his siblings just means their personalities just don't gel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat about Brian and Jeremy wanting to spend time with their brother ? Well, what a great time to teach them about consent and being allowed to only let in people in your life you want to be part of your life !\n\nThanks for further cementing why I want to be OaD, though ? As for Nick, two more years and you'll be free of your AH parent OP ! Yay !", "YTA. It is NOT an obligation.", "I understand what you are trying to do, but all it WILL do is make your eldest son resent his younger brothers. Let him spend time with them when he wants to. He will want to at some point. He's 16. He's coming into his own as a teen going into adulthood. Let him have his moments.   \n\n\nYOU decided to have the kids. YOU have the obligation, NOT your son.   \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. As a older sibling of 8 years, your son does not have an obligation to be with his younger brothers.

YTA.", "YTA  \nno, he does not have any \"obligations\" to his younger siblings, you on the other hand are the parent, YOU have obligations to them, it sounds like you want a baby sitter. it sounds like he is fine on his own, and you can give attention to the younger ones, also saying he had you both to himself, and they don't, well that was YOUR choice to have more kids, and not his burden to deal with your choices", "YTA. Or else what, exactly?\nYou can't punish someone into enjoying hanging out with their younger siblings, in fact it seems attempting to do so has only sowed further alienation.", "yta", "No, OP, that\u2019s not how families work. No one should be expected to spend time with their siblings out of obligation. You just want him to hang out with the boys so that YOU don\u2019t have to do your job as a parent and explain to them why a teenager\u2019s every day social life doesn\u2019t include his kid brothers. \n\nThe fact that you and your wife decided to have 2 more kids is your problem, not his. What\u2019s gonna happen is Nick is going to resent his siblings because of how they were pushed on him. YTA\n\nETA: encouraging some family activities for everyone to participate is ok imo, not forcing a teen to spend 1 hour a day doing homework with the little ones", "YTA he hasn\u2019t any responsibility towards the kids that YOU chose to have\u2026 only you have a responsibility as a parent", "Yta.  He does not have an obligation here.   They aren\u2019t his kids. YOU spend an hour a day with them.  You are the one who chose to have them.", "No that's not how families work, it's how YOU see families work and how YOU think it works, don't put that shit on your son, 1 hour a day ?? To a teenager ?? Hell no, sometimes yeah why not, but 1 hour a day is too much YTA", "yta\n\nor else what?\n\nThis is the path to alienating your older son, and fostering deep resentment between them all.  Send the three into a store to grab munchies etc- little stuff that isn't going to offend or upset the older, while giving the younger the opportunity to do a 'thing' with their brother. Resentment is a very deep thing to create. Take care.", "There needs to be a standardized test for being a parent. YTA.", "Agree. Op should encourage family dinners, and insist on some time that's just family and not always a hang out. But the forced hour a day is a big ask and totally counter productive\n\nYTA", ">You can't dictate relationships.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP sure tried.  From the original post:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He said he disagreed. So I said that he has an obligation as an older brother. That's how it is and that's how families work. So be a more active older brother or else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIssuing threats to a kid who is on his way out of the house?  OP actually went there?  \n\nImagine what might have happened had OP gone to Nick and said, \"Look, I know it's hardly the cool thing for the big man on campus to hang out with his kid brothers, but it would mean the world to them if they could spend time with you.  And frankly, you're not going to be living under our roof much longer.  Can we figure out a way that you can spend some time with them more regularly?\"  \n\nIn other words, present Nick with the problem and ask him for input to fix it.", "Well, that or else will only last two years because Nick is definitely going NC", "He chose not to have siblings. He is not their parent, so they have no obligations to them. Yes, it's nice of him to hang out with them, but obviously he has a social life...and they're a lot younger than him.", "I love when the people of this sub reddit latch onto a new buzzword and then throw it around in any scenario they think it might be relevant in. First it was DARVO, now it's parentification.", "So many lazy parents who come here who decide to parentify the oldest child and don't think they're TA", "I'm not sure that's morally correct. But expecting an hour a day is a ludicrous requirement.", "depending on where they live the 16yr old can move out now, and it's still the parents responsibility to pay for food, clothes and shelter", "Thank you for this. The OP is wrong to Jane such a hard time requirement and is definitely TA, but imo expecting an older child to help with basic child care or babysitting on occasion is totally fine.\n\nParentification happened in my case for sure. Examples include:\n\n1. My mom expecting me at 5 years old to change my brother when he wet his pants because she couldn\u2019t \u201cdeal with it\u201d.\n\n2. Not letting me join extracurricular activities, including one where I was the *only* person in the class not allowed to join, because I was expected to be home to watch my brother. This started from age 10 until age 13. After age 13, we were in different schools and my school day ended later than my brother\u2019s school.\n\n3. I was expected by 10 years old to help with vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms, and cleaning the kitchen. I was also 100% responsible for my own laundry. The only reason my brother learned how to do laundry at 16 is because I refused to do it for him when my parents were both out of town.", "Exactly. I bet he wouldn't be the athletic popular kid if he didn't have continuous support from his family, and no way would all the cool kids hang out at his house if that wasn't the case. OP's son is old enough to realize what his family does for him and to start give something back. Not parental responsibilities, but some care and consideration. Just shows once more that \"being popular\" and \"getting along with everyone\" are not at all the same as being social in the caring sense.", "I don't think helping a first/second grader and a third/fourth grader do homework is a major challenge.

People on this sub are so damn dramatic.\n\nSincerely,\nA former *actually* parentified child", "No. It still isn't. Parentification is when children literally take the role of the parent or caregiver in their younger siblings' or parents' lives. It's children and teenagers having to give up their childhood and adolescence in order to become \"parents\" way before they are actually physically, mentally, or emotionally ready to do so. It's a form of abuse. Being made to spend an hour a day with your younger siblings, while dumb and inconsiderate, is NOT parentification.", "No disagreement from me here.", "He literally used the phrase \u201cor else\u201d!

That's what I'm wondering. I don't know how OP doesn't realize that the only thing his demand is going to do is ensure that his oldest son resents/hates his younger brothers.  Right now the age difference is significant enough that it's understandable why his eldest doesn't want to hang out with the young ones; given time that might change, but if he forces the issue it will likely permanently damage the brothers' relationship.
