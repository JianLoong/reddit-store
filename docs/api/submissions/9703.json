They go to dinner or lunch together and discuss both work stuff and real talk.\n\nEven though Lauren always looks very clean and put together, she also isn't a very professional dresser in my opinion, not the way an office lady usually looks. She rarely wears make up, keeps her hair in a short cut and does nothing to style it, and wears only pants to work, never a dress or skirt, and only button downs and blazers. I love her and I love that the work environment she's in let's her feel comfortable enough to dress like this. She likes make up, she just likes either to be barefaced or go for dramatic looks that aren't appropriate for the office. Rarely she'll put on some lipstick and basic contouring. \n\nThose two facts together made me think that when she invited me to join her at a work dinner on Tues that it wasn't a formal occasion. I asked Lauren was she was wearing, she said nice slacks, a button down and a blazer, telling me that I would be fine to do the same, plus on FaceTime she had metallic eyeshadow and white eyeliner on, so I dressed in dark blue jeans and a plaid flannel button down. \n\nWhen I showed up, I quickly realized not only was there more than just Lauren and Chelsea but I was the only person wearing jeans, not that it was easy to see that especially once we all sat down. One of Lauren's coworkers was wearing a polo and khakis though, which I felt was equal to my outfit. No one looked twice at my clothes and we all had a good time. It was a nonissue. \n\nLauren and I had planned on her following me home so she could stay the night with me, but when we got to our cars she said she didn't want to anymore because she was mad I didn't dress appropriately to dinner. I said I dressed just as appropriately as she did because there was nothing business appropriate about wearing white eyeliner. She just laughed in my face at that and told me to fuck off.

For starters, her work attire sounds professional.

I\u2019m a lawyer, so I\u2019d say I work in a pretty conservative industry. I rarely wear make up unless I\u2019m going to be recording videos or, like yesterday when I was interviewed for TV. I have an incredibly successful career & it sounds like I dress a lot like your gf. It\u2019s asshats like you that make it ten times harder for women to be taken seriously unless they look the way you expect", "YTA. And a misogynist by the sounds of it. Women aren't required to wear makeup, have intricate hairdos, and wear skirts or dresses to be dressed professionally. If she typically dresses neatly in dress pants and a button down (sometimes with a blazer) that's the very definition of business casual. You expect her to be dressed high-femme not \"professional.\" If a man wore slacks, a button down, amd a blazer would you consider that unprofessional? Casual? Also dressing in jeans and calling that equivalent to slacks is asinine as well as dismissive. It was a work dinner and she told you to dress similarly to her. You didn't and then insulted her by saying her eye makeup wasn't professional.", "YTA - namely because you asked what to wear and then did the opposite\u2026\u2026.. and now you are trying to justify your actions by weaponizing ignorance especially for a work event\u2026", "YTA. So Lauren shows up in work appropriate clothes \u2014 yes, women wearing button-downs, blazers, and slacks is completely normal office wear \ud83d\ude44 \u2014 and hearing that, you decide to dress like a lumber jack out for night at the bar with friends?

And your equating that to khakis and a polo is absolutely absurd. You messed up. YTA.", "YTA. Nice slacks and blazers isn't professional? And \"no makeup\" is now somehow unprofessional?? Go back to 1953 with that. Jeans and a flannel are casual, slacks and blazers are professional, and rather than acknowledge you were weing and an AH, you insulted her makeup. You are pretty much the worst kind of AH here.", "YTA\n\n> she said nice slacks, a button down and a blazer, telling me I would be fine to do the same\n\n\nWhat part of that made you think jeans and a flannel would be appropriate? Not only are you gross for criticizing her work appropriate work clothes choices, but you suck for intentionally underdressing for her work related dinner.", ">Even though Lauren always looks very clean and put together, she also isn't a very professional dresser in my opinion, not the way an office lady usually looks. She rarely wears make up, keeps her hair in a short cut and does nothing to style it, and wears only pants to work, never a dress or skirt, and only button downs and blazers.\n\nFor that statement alone YTA. Oh by the way, jeans and a flannel shirt is not the same as polo shirt and khakis. Unless you work in a barn, jeans and a flannel shirt are not business casual.", "Jeans and a plaid flannel shirt are not the same level of dress as nice slacks, a button down, and a blazer. Jeans and flannel are WAY more casual than \"business casual\" khakis and polos. \n\nI wear jeans and flannel frequently, but I would not dream of wearing them if I was going to do net with SO and workmates. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. She said business casual and you really thought you could show up looking like a hipster? And then had the nerve to have a dig at her \\*checks notes\\* eyeliner. Something tells me you had to search REAL hard for that one. \n\nYeah, no. I'm smelling bullshit. You knew.", "YTA for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. You don't think what your girlfriend wears to work is \"professional\" because she's not dressing as feminine as you think she should. You didn't say that outright, but if short hair, slacks, and not much makeup aren't professional that's clearly how you think. What she wears, as you describe, is absolutely professional for most office environments.\n2. You thought that your jeans and plaid flannel were comparable to her slacks, button up shirt, and blazer. Look, jeans and a flannel are great. That's what I wear most of the winter, but it is definitely casual. As above, I think this is rooted in your attitudes about femininity and professional dress for women that you thought your outfit was comparable to hers.", ">She . . . keeps her hair in a short cut and does nothing to style it, and wears only pants to work, never a dress or skirt, and only button downs and blazers.\n\nAll of the foregoing is business appropriate. Makeup is not necessary for women to be business appropriate. Jeans are never business appropriate, I don't care what color they are. A flannel is never business appropriate. Finally, the fact that no one commented on your outfit does not mean that your outfit was acceptable. It just means that your (now ex\u2013?) girlfriend's colleagues had good home training. \n\nYes, YTA. You embarrassed Lauren in front of her colleagues. Rather than apologize for that faux pas, you got defensive and attempted (incorrectly, I might add) to compare your sartorial choices to hers. I can understand why she would not want to talk with you.", "INFO: why did you blatantly ignore the very specific and easy to follow dress code she gave you for the dinner?

She was wearing slacks, a button down shirt and a blazer and you wore jeans and a flannel?!  You think those two looks are equally casual?  What a joke! \n\nThe way you describe your gf by her hair and make up also gave me ick vibes.", "YTA\n\nShe said she was wearing nice slacks, a button down, and a blazer, how does that translate to you wearing jeans and flannel?\n\nYou picking apart her physical appearance makes you double the AH. Why do you think *women* need to wear makeup and have special hair-dos for work? From what I read her work is business professional and she meets it, how she \u201clooks\u201d is irrelevant\n\nETA: a polo and khakis are business casual, you showed up [casual](https://www.sfasu.edu/ccpd/students-alumni/professional-dress)", "YTA.\n\nFor a few reasons.\n\n1) You project your \"what's appropriate work attire\" on your gf.\n\nYou DO know that women wear slacks and a blouse to work now, right? Skirts and blouse are no longer the only \"acceptable\" professional attire for women. Oh right. No, you don't. Well, consider this a heads-up.\n\n2) You think that because your gf doesn't dress as you think is appropriate for work (ie, skirts), that wearing jeans is akin to her wearing slacks. \n\nIt's not. Jeans is casual... like, go out to a bar with your buddies drinking casual. Slacks are in no way equal to jeans. \n\n3) You think her wearing white eyeliner is unprofessional. \n\nReally? Now I'm getting gobsmacked.\n\n4) She invited you to a work dinner and you totally made her look like an AH.\n\nShe told you it wasn't formal, ie, suit not required. It WAS, however, a work dinner. That means co-workers, probably boss/supervisor, which means, you dress appropriately... ESPECIALLY as you were a +1 to her at HER work dinner. She is wearing slacks, blouse and a blazer. That means YOU wear slacks and a button down dress shirt, at the minimum. But no, you show up in jeans.\n\n5) After dinner, you were STILL clueless, wanting her to spend the night with you, and clueless WHY she was pissed when you told her that you dressed just as appropriately as she did.\n\nNo. You didn't. She had every right to be pissed with you making her look stupid at a work dinner because you have zero clue about what is/isn't appropriate professional work attire for women and equating her attire to jeans.", "YTA \n\nNice slacks, a button down and a blazer are not the equivalent of a plaid shirt and jeans.\n\nSide note: I see nothing unprofessional in the way she dresses for work.  You seem overly critical of her and what is with the \u201coffice lady\u201d description?", "YTA, what decade do you think this is? Women don't have to wear dresses and skirts, lipstick or have long hair to look professional. You need to get over that ridiculousness now.", "YTA. She told you to wear slacks and a blazer. Did you wear slacks and a blazer? You did not. Next time you're invited to someone else's work event, dress the way you're told.", "Yta. Jeans are not the same as the nice slacks she told you to wear.  And insulting her makeup? What an ass.", "YTA and I hope she dumps your ass.", "YTA. \n\nMakeup doesn\u2019t make a look more professional. \nNeither does having long hair. \n\nPants and blazers are equally professional to nice dresses.\n\nIt seems you have a very sexist view of what is professional attire for women", "YTA. You asked her what was appropriate to wear. She told you. You just went ahead and wore the exact opposite. Why\u2019d you even bother to ask?", "YTA\n\nShe dresses professionally. You\u2019re just a misogynistic AH who has a dated idea of what women SHOULD do to meet your expectations. Gross.", "YTA. Why do you think that a woman must wear a dress or skirt, with makeup and styled hair, to be considered professional?  A blazer and slacks sounds pretty professional to me. You know what does not? Jeans and a flannel.", "YTA, I think you're misinformed about what counts as a norm for officewear. Blazers and nice slacks are pretty typical officewear for both men and women, whereas jeans and flannels are not. Makeup is a mixed bag but it's a less important part of work-appropriate wear than it used to be, thankfully; hair doesn't enter into it at all.\n\nJeans are specifically considered too casual for work, unless paired with a shirt and blazer, which is what i generally do. A polo and khakis are not at all on the same level, and are much more likely to be considered work-appropriate. You don't understand the norms of work attire and you should apologise to your girlfriend.", "YTA. Your opinions on women's professional casual wear are wholly outdated, which in and of itself is not a big deal but ignoring your gf's description of how you'd be expected to present yourself for a dinner relating to her job because you're not aware of her office definition of business casual (which is pretty standard for every office I've worked in for the record) and going in jeans and a nice flannel, then saying she was not dressed appropriately for her office culture is a dick move. Khakis and a polo shirt is whether you agree or not seen as being more professional than jeans and a flannel. You might have looked nice, but it wasn't the appropriate choice and instead of just admitting you misunderstood/misinterpreted what was expected you made it about her make up.", "Yta flannel and jeans are not equivalent to dress shirt and slacks", "YTA \n\nYou clearly described her as wearing formal attire but then you decided that it wasn't formal, and thus dressed as if it were casual, because of her makeup choice.", "YTA. She told you exactly what to wear and you ignored", "YTA and I think your ex-girlfriend was pretty clear why", "She told you she was wearing a blazer and slacks and to dress accordingly, so you show up dressed as Bender from the Breakfast Club? Come on, now. And the aside about the eyeliner was pretty low. YTA.", "YTA\n\n> she said nice slacks, a button down and a blazer, telling me that I would be fine to do the same\n\n**does not equal**\n\n>I dressed in dark blue jeans and a plaid flannel button down\n\n\nSo this isn't a true ahole, more of a misunderstanding, but I do think you missed on this one. Nice slacks implies dress pants or at least some nice khakis, not blue jeans. If she's wearing a blazer, I'd put on a dress shirt over the flannel.\n\nWhenever you go with a work type event with your partner, even if your instinct is it's relatively informal, get a pretty clear understanding of dress expectations. You're a reflection of them. Now if she flipped out when you were just meeting up with her friends and said you were underdressed, that would be different, but there is a higher bar of making sure you dress appropriately at any work related thing.", "YTA. mostly for the way you describe your girlfriend\u2019s attire and makeup. wtf does \u201can office lady\u201c wear anyway in the year of our lord 2023? you don\u2019t even work there! besides, a button down and blazer sounds pretty office appropriate to me! the other reason YTA is you didn\u2019t match her level of formality. she was wearing a blazer, a button down and nice slacks. where was *your* blazer? that could have elevated the jeans so you might have been safe, but surely you have nicer pants you could have worn as well. I think you give yourself too much credit for your flannel and jeans and your girlfriend far too little for her standard blazer uniform.\n\nand I\u2019m sorry but how do you know so much about makeup (e.g., basic contouring and your eyeliner rules) and not know that a flannel and jeans isn\u2019t the male equivalent of a women\u2019s blazer, button down and dress pants?", "My dude. It\u2019s 2023 and women wear pants. Yes, even in very formal settings. We acquire such garments at stores which have other business-formal-appropriate-attire such as tailored suit jackets and blouses. We also enjoy styling our hair in a variety of well-groomed styles, which are also considered to be appropriate in the business environment. \n\nPlease return your opinions of appropriate feminine dress to the 1950s and return in business casual attire suitable for the dinner you were invited to. This is, to be specific, a nicer pair of khaki pants with a collared shirt for men. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nYou are simultaneously clueless and way too clued in.

It isn\u2019t professional regardless of how you *think* they appear\n\nThen why did you think it was relevant to discuss her face/hair?", "I think the flannel is more of a problem than the jeans. You might have been able to get away with something like black jeans with a business- casual type shirt. \n\nFYI: Your gf wearing nice pants is equal to you wearing nice pants. \u201cNice,\u201d \u201cprofessional,\u201d and \u201cformal\u201d never imply that a woman should or needs to wear a dress or skirt.
