We were originally going to elope but I knew my parents (54F and 60M) would be upset if they missed out on that so we are now having a microwedding with roughly 14 people including me, groom, officiant and photographer and just parents and siblings.\n\nSince the beginning of wedding planning we made it known that we werent doing any of the traditional things. No speeches, no wedding party, no reception, no DJ, no dances no extra nothing. We said it was just going to be the ceremony, photos then dinner and that would be it. It seemed like everyone understood the plan. \n\nNow my dad has asked to walk me down the isle and do a father and daughter dance and i said no to both as we clearly stated in the beginning we weren\u2019t ent doing any of that. My fianc\u00e9 and i are walking down together. I am frustrated because i said we arent doing any and my dad said \u201ci dont care what you do i just want to have a dance with you before you leave.\u201d To me i see it as them not respecting my wishes for mine and my fiances day. He is not doing any dances either. I get that there is also a generational gap. I also dont know if because my sister had a traditional american wedding with all the bells and whistles that he wants the same and is having a hard time understanding the microwedding. I was thinking of having my dad sign as a witness instead. \n\nTo also be transparent, my folks did help pay but i had already stated what we wanted and didnt want and they seemed to agree prior to offering to pay. We dont need the money and are willing to write them a check giving them there money back if thats what it comes down too. They said they would help pay because they helped pay for my sisters. I do think that if they offered to pay it should be out of generosity and not to try and hold power and have a say in what happens. \n\nSo to the question. Would i be the a hole for skipping the dance? I know i would feel extremely awkward and uncomfortable doing it and i don\u2019t  think i should have to feel that way on my wedding day.", "created_utc": 1696620501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171ld38/wibta_for_skipping_the_fatherdaughter_dance_at_my/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've been to small wedding receptions that didn't have dancing or entertainment and they've always been great times.", "NAH\n\nDoesn't sound like dad threatened you with money, he just made a request and said it was important to him? It's possible in your dad's head, that this is just his way of saying goodbye to his daughter, that it would be meaningful to him.\n\nIf you and your dad are close, he's been in your corner, etc, maybe re-consider? If not, then just say no and be done. And if it means you pay for dinner (?  micro-wedding?) then so be it.", "NTA your wedding, your choice, especially if you are the only ones financing the whole thing", "Info:  (which doesn't change my judgement, I'm just curious) - if you are having a ceremony and then a nice dinner at a restaurant, where would you actually do the dance?\n\nAnyway, NTA.  I love your simple wedding, which is actually what my partner and I are planning.  Neither of us care about the wedding itself and it sounds like you don't either.  We just want a stress free day and to celebrate what is important, which for us is the marriage.   I hope your day is perfect.", "NTA. Your choice. They knew you weren\u2019t doing dances. Plenty of other ways you can let dad know how much you love him", "NTA i think of the money as a gift not a payment to take part in your wedding.\nIts your day and they have no say in it.\n\nMake a big deal of asking him as your witness to sign your wedding thingie let him feel that is special and maybe your fiance can ask his mom to be his witness  make it part of the ceremonie so they feel included and special but you don't have to dance.\n\nSorry for the spelling i'm a little high on morfine (legal way not the addict way)", "NTA, and stand your ground. My father threw a fit and I caved and it\u2019s one of my biggest regrets about the day. He also wanted to use music he wrote for the aisle walk and the first dance. Awww, right? No. He wanted the attention on him.", "NTA \n\nAnd I'm not a fan of the whole dad walking the daughter down and giving her away.... It's so archaic. Like it's the mom walking her son down to give him away? And seriously, when was the last time you slow danced for 3-4 minutes with your dad? When you were 4? \n\nId offer the check back and say you weren't doing any dances especially since the entire wedding was already your concession.\n\nAnd get ready for baby drama if you don't start setting and sticking to your boundaries!", "When did the father/daughter dance become part of the wedding? I thought that was typically part of the reception, which you are not having. It's your wedding and your day, so NTA for whatever you decide to do with it, but if there's no reception I don't even understand where the question came from.", "NTA. Dad is reading into the meanings of 'traditional American weddings' way too much. As you said, it's your wedding and you've explained this thoroughly.

However, doing something to honour your respective families and acknowledging their role in the adults and partners you have become would go a long way into turning your day into something every parent and child has dreamed of.", "NTA. He needs to realize 1- you said no and 2-nobody else will be dancing, it would be super awkward and you just refuse.", "NTA. You set your boundaries. Part of a wedding is the community celebration, which has lots of different traditions depending on your culture. Those are not just about you - they are about the people you know and love who want to celenrate with you. Cutting those things out will make others feel like they are observers more than participants, but it is your choice. Giving you dad a role, such as a witness is a nice gesture, but it is not what he expected.", "YTA if you don't reimburse your parents immediately. You are so adamant about not wanting a traditional wedding, but it's tradition for the bride's family to pay. So make up your mind. \n\nAll your dad wants is to literally dance with his daughter. The horror. \n\nAlso, you note in a comment that if you dance with your dad then MIL would throw a fit. So are you doing this because you honestly can't be bothered to dance with him or avoiding MIL. If it's the latter, that's your husband's issue.", "I get the whole \u201cyour wedding, your choice\u201d thing but man, would it really kill either of you to dance with your respective parents. There is no indication here that either of you have a bad relationship with them. Even if they weren\u2019t paying for it it\u2019s really strange that neither of you are willing to spare 2 mins to have a dance. Your dad loves you and wants to spend a special moment with you like he was able to with your sister.\n\nIm not gonna say you\u2019re an asshole but neither is your dad(or your future MIL). NAH. Maybe I am a little biased as my mom passed when I was 12. I would have given anything to have that dance with her at my wedding.(It was also small we only had about 20 people there)", "it is ur wedding and yall should do what best suits u. but do understand with power comes consequences. NAH", "NAH\n\nIt's your wedding and you can do anything that you want.\n\nHowever there's always a way to include elements of what you like and include them in a way that appeals to you.\n\nFor example. Instead of walking you down the isle, your dad can ride with you to the ceremony. You can have a private father daughter dance wherever you are getting ready at. (Your SO can also have a private dance before going to the ceremony as well.)\n\nYou can also create a Spotify playlist of you and your SO's favorite songs for your guests to play in their car  while traveling for your event. If everyone lives locally, you can arrange them to meet at the restaurant then carpool to the park then back to the restaurant after the ceremony, that way all the guests arrive together and there's less people having to drive during rush hour. \n\nYou might look into hiring a car and driver for a few hours to help with the transportation logistics.\n\nJust be creative and thoughtful. You can still have a low stress event without skipping the special moments.", "Without any other context about you and your family\u2019s relationship, I would say YTA. It seems like you have nice loving parents and you are being spiteful as shit by saying no to two things important to your father that would literally take about 5 minutes.", "Assuming you have a good relationship with your father as your post gives no indication to the contrary: YWBTA. What a weird hill to die on. \n\nI get not enjoying having the attention on you and how it might influence the type of wedding you have. But there are only 14 people there. People I assume you care about and that care about you. Its not a big to-do. Heck, you could even go in a separate room to have a dance with your dad, where no one else can watch you. \n\nWould it really be that excruciating to give your father one dance? Does your hatred of dancing outweigh the joy and happiness this would clearly give your dad? Does your need for singularity and a non-traditional prevent you from stepping out of your comfort zone for 3 flipping minutes?\n\nIf I was your dad I would not only be incredibly sad but also incredibly ashamed to have raised such a selfish child. \n\nBut hey, it\u2019s your life, you decide what kind of relationship you want to have (or not have) with your parents.", "ESH. Refund your parents. Cancel the existing wedding. Instead, go to to your preferred quiet spot, with only legally required people present - wedding dream achieved.", "NTA, your wedding, your plans. But that said, can you do a dance with your father and not call it the dad-daughter dance? Just do it at some random point of the night with whatever music is playing?", "NTA. But would it kill you to throw him a bone. Try to find something presuming you have a good relationship", "NTA for wanting your day your way. However, as someone whose dad got the flu right before her wedding, think carefully about this. He made it through the ceremony but not the reception. I never got my dance. The only one of 5 daughters. My dad is gone and I miss him every day. How hard would it be to put  YouTube on your phone and dance with your dad? It's not a big ask, especially for the guy paying for your day.", "> and my dad said \u201ci dont care what you do i just want to have a dance with you before you leave.\"\n\nMan do I feel bad for your dad. \n\n> To me i see it as them not respecting my wishes for mine and my fiances day.\n\nI can't exactly call you \"entitled\" but geez, your post and your subsequent comments just drip of hostility and a lack of regard for anyone else's feelings. Yes, it's your wedding and it's your right to decide what is and isn't involved, but you just have NO flex in you.\n\n> I know i would feel extremely awkward and uncomfortable doing it\n\nWhy? That's such a disproportionate reaction for what is such a simple, routine, and undramatic thing.\n\nI'm not going to call someone an AH for having a wedding the way they want, but this whole thing feels weirdly spiteful.", "I'll be honest and go against the grain.\n\nYta\n\nLeaving your daughter at the altar and dancing is a very unique moment that many parents want to be able to spend with their daughters, because at that moment you can say that its a goodbye.\n\nIt's like when an adult buys their first house and throws a party to celebrate the achievement of being able to buy a house.\n\nBut in this cases is like \"\"I am happy for you that you have found someone who respects you and takes care of you, my daugther\"\n\nPersonally I agree if you don't want him to take you to the altar, it's understandable.\n\nNow start thinking about this, is it going to kill you to have a slow dance with your dad?\n\nI am not one to put up with parties or family celebrations much, but sometimes for the people who are there for us we have to do our part a little.\n\nEddit:Grammar\n\n\nI thought I had already posted", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
