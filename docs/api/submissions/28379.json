We were originally going to elope but I knew my parents (54F and 60M) would be upset if they missed out on that so we are now having a microwedding with roughly 14 people including me, groom, officiant and photographer and just parents and siblings.\n\nSince the beginning of wedding planning we made it known that we werent doing any of the traditional things. No speeches, no wedding party, no reception, no DJ, no dances no extra nothing. We said it was just going to be the ceremony, photos then dinner and that would be it. It seemed like everyone understood the plan. \n\nNow my dad has asked to walk me down the isle and do a father and daughter dance and i said no to both as we clearly stated in the beginning we weren\u2019t ent doing any of that. My fianc\u00e9 and i are walking down together. I am frustrated because i said we arent doing any and my dad said \u201ci dont care what you do i just want to have a dance with you before you leave.\u201d To me i see it as them not respecting my wishes for mine and my fiances day. He is not doing any dances either. I get that there is also a generational gap. I also dont know if because my sister had a traditional american wedding with all the bells and whistles that he wants the same and is having a hard time understanding the microwedding. I was thinking of having my dad sign as a witness instead. \n\nTo also be transparent, my folks did help pay but i had already stated what we wanted and didnt want and they seemed to agree prior to offering to pay. We dont need the money and are willing to write them a check giving them there money back if thats what it comes down too. They said they would help pay because they helped pay for my sisters. I do think that if they offered to pay it should be out of generosity and not to try and hold power and have a say in what happens. \n\nSo to the question. Would i be the a hole for skipping the dance? I know i would feel extremely awkward and uncomfortable doing it and i don\u2019t  think i should have to feel that way on my wedding day.", "created_utc": 1696620501, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171ld38/wibta_for_skipping_the_fatherdaughter_dance_at_my/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can still have a low stress event without skipping the special moments.", "Without any other context about you and your family\u2019s relationship, I would say YTA.

Heck, you could even go in a separate room to have a dance with your dad, where no one else can watch you. \n\nWould it really be that excruciating to give your father one dance? Does your hatred of dancing outweigh the joy and happiness this would clearly give your dad? Does your need for singularity and a non-traditional prevent you from stepping out of your comfort zone for 3 flipping minutes?\n\nIf I was your dad I would not only be incredibly sad but also incredibly ashamed to have raised such a selfish child. \n\nBut hey, it\u2019s your life, you decide what kind of relationship you want to have (or not have) with your parents.", "ESH.

He made a slide show (actual slides) of pictures of me growing up and showed them at a family dinner a couple of nights before the wedding day (1992 before it was a thing that I knew about).

If OP is close to the dad, its a good compromise without a lot of effort and it would mean a lot to the dad", "I love the memories of my Dad walking me down the aisle & dancing with him.  I had been out of my parents\u2019 house for over 10 years, so it really didn\u2019t feel like he was \u201cgiving me away\u201d, it just felt nice.  OP can do what she wants, but she is lucky to have a dad feel the way he does.  One dance with his daughter", "My dad died suddenly a few months after my wedding. I remember that I asked the DJ to cut our dance short (to only 2 minutes) and I think about that all the time. He had wanted to dance to butterfly kisses and I said absolutely no way. Well mid reception it starts playing (he asked the band to play it during their break) so I did reluctantly agree to it. It meant so much to him to be able to walk me down the aisle and dance with me at my wedding. I\u2019m glad I have these memories with him. Yes the wedding is your day, so you NTA for wanting it to be your complete vision but on the other hand you can do more than just be NTA, you could really make your dad happy and create a memory that I think you\u2019ll end up treasuring. You have not indicated your relationship is otherwise strained.", "I\u2019m really surprised that all these types of comments are being downvoted. OP sounds super immature. She wants him to pay for the wedding but can\u2019t give him 3 minutes? Is this a generational thing?", "Ughhh your moms suggestion sounds so tacky", "Could you offer to have a quick dance beforehand or the night before at dinner or something? Something to commemorate the occasion, but not during the wedding itself? He might just want the memory to hold on to and not care if it's in front of others.", "Great don't dance at all. Don't take the attention. \n\nYou know what other people don't like being taken advantage of. Return your dad's money. Your wedding your rules. Fund it yourself.", "100% makes me wonder if the request really originated with the Dad or if it was Mums...", "No dances period is the issue", "But it isn't sexist to expect her Father to pay for the wedding though huh.", "Ahhh another winner of GUESS WHOS DYING IN THE RETIREMENT HOME has graced us with their presence. OP told them from the jump and theyre still offering her money.", "Well it is not necessarily sexist to have parents help with their children\u2019s weddings. I don\u2019t believe in family of the bride pays the most.  I believe it should be even, if both can pay.  And OP  did say her folks were helping pay. Folks means both parents. The family wanted them to have an actual wedding and dinner not just elope, so her folks (not just her father) were helping pay for it.  Seems fair.  And doesn\u2019t say they are paying for all it.", "A bluetooth speaker and 12 square feet of space. This isn't rocket science.", "Yeah like OP is already compromising."]}
