Unfortunately, statistically speaking they might be (srsly you guys using fake service dog vests on your dogs, shame on you) but I just wanted to chime in because while you don't HAVE to show a card, that doesn't mean all cards/certs are fake.

The dog\u2019s way of alerting her we\u2019re to jump up and bark at her. It was loud and obnoxious but it was also effective at getting her attention and letting her know that she needed to take care of herself. It was also trained to do specific tasks should she pass out or go into an episode and many of those tasks also coincided with the dog making enough of a ruckus to alert those of the presence of his owner in trouble.", "What's an appropriate behavior?

If the dog is attacked in public, it can become reactive. If the dog gets sick, it can have accidents.  For instance, my dog got sick recently, and I couldn\u2019t take him into public, because he might well have had an accident, and they could have legally\u2026and responsibly\u2026kicked us out.  But I was responsible and didn\u2019t bring him.  He is better now.  The ADA **says**, specifically, that a service dog that is aggressive, disruptive, or making a mess can be kicked out.  These things do happen.  Responsible handlers deal with training and health issues proactively.
