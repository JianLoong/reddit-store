You are capitalizing on the passing of your \u201cbest friend\u201d and the grief of his family. And you did that by deceiving a grieving mother in order to gain financially. This is something that would be extremely cruel to do to a stranger let alone the vulnerable family you claim to be so close to. You\u2019re pretty close to just about the worst humanity has to offer. Try to salvage any respect and decency and return the cards and never contact them again.", "YTA. Friend dies, I may ask for a small keepsake to remember them by, not a Pok\u00e9mon binder. And you really had no idea that any of those cards had value?

Do you know her well enough to trust she would give the money to Lisa and not just keep it ? Lisa was going to throw them away and you saved them which is great. I would say to look through them and if there are any very rare and valuable ones you could talk with Lisa about them. I would offer to find a buyer and she should get the money to help her out. I wouldn't just hand them over without talking to his mom", "YTA. Elly is grieving and wants to hold on to her brother. She probably realized they were gone. Just give them to her, dude. But she may have realized what they are worth and she legit needs to help the family", "YTA, and you know that. The funny thing is that in the grand scheme of things this is probably no big deal, but you get to live with what you\u2019ve done. You snagging a sweet profit is not what your friend would have wanted.", "YTA. You\u2019re taking advantage of a grieving woman. How can you even justify this to yourself?", "Why don't you buy the cards off Lisa.

Its not about asking for them its decieving a grieving family and taking cards that you plan on selling to make money. \n\nThe post didnt make you seem that bad but one comment you are the worst.", "YTA\n\nYou lied to your friends grieving mother about the value of the cards for your own benefit. You then convinced her to let you have them instead and then you say that you eventually plan on selling the cards yourself because that is what Jack would have wanted.

Give the cards back.", "YTA i was originally going to say otherwise but your comment for clarification really hammers it home how you are the asshole, you were asked if any of the cards had value and you were like \"idk they are just cards\" when you knew they had value, and even then i might have forgiven you for that....but you aren't even keeping them as a keepsake you are literally planning on selling them, you didn't care that they belonged to your \"best friend\" you cared that they had value", "After reading your comments, YTA.", "YTA, do you really think that deceiving your late friends mom into giving you a valuable collection of pokemon cards is what your friend would have wanted?\n\n You knew what you were doing and had every intention of selling those cards to get the money. You just didn't expect his sister to find out that it was valuable.\n\n Do the right thing and give the cards back and leave this family alone.", "YTA! You\u2019ve since learned some are quite valuable and you plan to sell them \u201cbecause that\u2019s what Jack would have wanted\u201d? Ridiculous. You didn\u2019t go over to get a small keepsake from your friend. You went looking for money. That\u2019s mercenary - and feels a lot like people who loot from others after natural disasters. Gross. His mom likely could use that money. Give them back and get this off your karma.", "YTA Totally theft by deception and a woman who just lost her son on top of it.", "YTA. You do not get to take advantage of a grieving family especially that of your friend. Either buy the cards on a good price for the both of you or return them.", "The only way you would N T A is of you asked the sister of you could have any that weren't of value if they don't sell the collection as a whole. If the mum needs financial help you 100% need to give them back", "YTA of course. You misled a grieving mother for monetary gain. Let that sink in. I hope Ellie tells everyone what you did.", "YTA\n\"it's what jack would have wanted\" oh please.\n\nSure, and my dead grandma would've wanted for me to inherit her rare books and have them sold eventually /s\n\nBFF or not that's disrespectful af", "YTA. At first I thought you were a collector, would play with the cards, etc. Then in the comments you admit about A. having lied to Lisa about the value and B. intending to sell them at some point in the future. That\u2019s such a dick ass move. If you were going to cherish the cards and use them as they\u2019re supposed to be used, and Elly clearly just wanted some extra cash, I would\u2019ve said n t a. But now you\u2019re not just TA, you\u2019re a *giant* A.", "NTA, at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou want to keep the cards, in part I imagine because of the sentimental value.

However, since she needs money, give her money because they do have a cash value in addition to the sentimental value.", "NTA, if his mother said it's okay then it's okay. It seems like his sister's a bit shady and just wants to sell them for her own profit after she realised how valuable Pokemon cards can be.", "NTA  \n\n\nBased on the evidence presented, it does not appear like you are the asshole (NTA) in this circumstance. You had permission from Jack's mother to take his Pokemon cards, and Elly had the option to claim items but showed little interest in the cards. It's understandable that you have an emotional attachment to Jack's possessions as his best buddy. It can be beneficial to have a courteous talk with Elly to express your point of view and discover a suitable compromise.", "NTA. Elly is not the next of kin, Lisa is. Lisa had/has the burden of burying her child and deciding what to do with his worldly remains. \n\nIf you want to be an over-the-top good egg, check in on Lisa from time to time (ignore Elly). It may do Lisa some good to know her son is remembered and still cherished outside of the value of his card collection.", "Assuming you wanted them for the memories and not just to sell them yourself, NTA. I can\u2019t imagine how cold hearted someone must be to want to sell their dead brother\u2019s belongings instead of them going to loved ones.", "NTA. If Lisa says she doesn't need the money, then everything is fine. I'm sure Jack would be happy you have them and so is Lisa.", "NTA. The mom gave them to you. If you want to be a really awesome guy and help the mom out, you could give his mom some money to help her out if you can afford it so you\u2019re \u201cbuying\u201d them. \n\nOf course just a suggestion but you\u2019re under no obligation to do that. Strictly if you want to.", "NTA, his mom invited you over and let you have it, and I\u2019m guessing you are gonna keep it as a keep sake and his sister was gonna sell it so you value it more and 100% deserve to keep it over his sister", "Legally the mother should be Jack's compulsory heir, meaning it's her decision what happens to his stuff, not the Elly's. \n\nMorally I'd say you're NTA, you clearly want the cards for sentimental reasons whereas Elly can only see them as money, for a good cause, but nonetheless money. \n\nAlso, while it wouldn't affect my answer, I'd like to know more specifics about this collection. Unless they're PSA 9-10 base/jungle/fossil or full arts of 10 year old girls, they probably aren't worth selling.", "NTA\n\nElly had first dibs and passed them over. Then **you** were the one helping Lisa clean out Jack\u2019s room. That\u2019s twice she missed her chance to take them. Elly simply found out after the cleaning they were worth money and suddenly wanted them. So she asked her mom, who said she gave them to you. They\u2019re yours now, fair and square. However, I would suggest that if you do I fact sell them, to give some of the money to Lisa if she does I fact need financial help. I wouldn\u2019t say that keeping it all would make you an asshole, but sharing it would certainly be one hell of a kind gesture towards a grieving mother.", "Nta. You had express permission from his mom and they weren\u2019t something sentimental to Elly since she was just going to sell them. Keep them and remember good memories with your friend.

That\u2019s disgusting behavior. You are delusional if you think your friend would have wanted you to basically scam his family.

A thousand times over.", "Doesn\u2019t matter if he did though? He intentionally mislead the mother into thinking they\u2019re worth less. He\u2019s a massive AH his poor best friend definitely rolling in his grave rn", "I think the issue here is that the mom literally asked if they had value and he lied. Wanting them for other reasons would be explaining they have value, offering to estimate value and then buying the ones you want. Swindling the mother of a friend so close to you they ask you to help clean out the room is the opposite of support.", "I agree. If OP had taken them with the intent to sell them then they would 100% be TA\n\nI get the impression that OP wanted the cards more for sentimental purposes and doesn't intend to sell them.

Those don't sit in binders. Their owners all know what they are and keep them under special protection.", "If the mother is in dire straits she could have chosen to keep the cards herself.
