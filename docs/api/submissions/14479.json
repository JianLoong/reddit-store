So...yeah.", "YTA for expecting him to call back and lie to his mother. You just said what he told her about the whiskey shots and beers is true. If your worried that makes your family look like a bunch of drunks, maybe what you\u2019re really embarrassed about is that\u2019s not so far off.", "Was he exaggerating or was his truthful? If he was being truthful, YTA. My family is Irish as well but we don't pass out shots and shot gun beer at family celebrations, so please don't try to normalize excessive drinking and paint an entire nationality with a wide brush because your family are big drinkers.", "YTA. Your feelings being hurt by the way he described your family is valid but you asking him to call his mom and lie about your family is not the solution.", "YTA. If what he saw is what he told her (ie he wasn't lying), then what's your issue? Your family aren't drunks, you said. You aren't ashamed of their behavior. So what's your problem with him honestly telling his mom what it was like?", "YTA\nIt was the truth, and I think he worded it kindly and non-judgemental.\nIf you are embarrassed by the reality of the behaviour of your family, they are the problem", "YTA. He wasn't saying it in a judgmental tone and what he said was 100% true. Calling his Mom to then call himself a liar would just be bizarre and unnecessary and make him look extremely weird.\n\nIf people are doing whiskey shots and shotgunning beers, that is pretty intense for a family party.

Say what you want but facts are facts. \n\nSide note - if your family does shots and shot guns beers on a religious family gathering you are who you are and anyone who knows your family knows how you roll.  These no secret to guard here from 'gossip'.", "YTA.  If he called back and recanted, his mother would know it was under duress. Worse for you.  The damage, as you see it, is done.  Let it go.", "although your feelings are valid, you would be an AH if you make him call back and lie. maybe ask yourself if you're projecting your own feelings towards your family? you said yourself that what he described actually happened. The way your feelings are valid so are his, that is what it felt like to him , but it seems like he was describing this in a more jovial sense. where as you're the one that seems to be passing harsher judgement towards your family. be proud of your family and stop trying to get your bf to lie to his family.", "YTA. As long as he accurate in describing the actual things that happened, and he was handed a shot of whiskey from a tray within ten minutes of arriving and multiple cousins try to get him to shotgun a beer, yeah, sounds like a college party (and a terrible time at that, but that is admittedly a subjective opinion), and if you are offended by how he accurately described the event, that is on you.", "YTA, but it was true.....  \n\n\nAlso how do you think the call is gonna play out?  Like \"Hey mom, ignore everything I said, I was exaggerating\"   Like that is a totally normal and not forced thing to do at all.....", "Is that what happened though? If he\u2019s telling the truth then YTA. It doesn\u2019t seem like he explicitly called them alcoholics and it does seem like your family tends to drink more than average at gatherings.", "A screening questionnaire for problem drinking includes \u201chave people annoyed you by criticising your drinking\u201d\u2026.

Also, just bc you feel some kind of way about what he said doesnt mean his mother had the same interpretation.", "YTA to encourage him to lie. He told the truth and the events he witnessed were probably \"wild\" to him. Yes, his family may discuss this among themselves (as yours probably would if you eported - for ex - about going to a St Paddy's day event with his family's place where not one drop of alcohol was available), but so what? He didn't lie, they won't be repeating lies, so where's the problem? If you aren't embarrassed by your family, why do you have a problem with him telling the truth? If your family's behavior embarrasses you, that's on you, not him. Either you are compatible & you'll work these differences out or they are too big and will end your relationship. You're the only ones who can decide, but gaslighting your bf sure won't help.  YOU are being judgemental and condemning his family for something you only THINK they might do, while your bf merely talked truth.", "One of the first signs of alcoholism is denying there is a problem............", "YTA Your bf was giving a truthful retelling of events to his mother. It sounds like you are embarrassed of your family, to be honest here. \n\nI don't drink, but the family I spend time with, including over Easter, does. They party and drink anytime they get together, and everyone understands that and accepts them. \n\nExpecting your bf to lie isn't the way to insure his parents like you and your family.", "YTA. those things happened. if people want to think that you're family is alcoholic because of that, well, what's to prove them wrong? if your family cannot have a function without alcohol being served like water, then yeah your family is alcoholic.", "YTA- I think you're overreacting a little. I feel like you shouldn't get offended about him telling his mother how it went unless there's an insecurity there. That's just what you do is share how a get together went. He told the truth I don't believe he owes you an apology.", "YTA for being mad at the mirror instead of the reflection", "YTA. It doesn't sound like he was being mean or judgemental in his description. This is probably bothering you as much as it is because you're hearing an outsiders description of something that you're blind to and view as \"normal\". But in no way does he owe you an apology. Especially not call his mom in front of you to tell her he exaggerated? Yikes. Do some reflections on your family situation.", "YTA. You\u2019re a family that likes a drink. Own it.\n\nMy in-laws are similar to your family, only difference being they\u2019re not ashamed of it. They love a big family get together with a load of booze and games and dancing, and everyone has a blast.", "YTA. Your families are obviously very different. Find a way to make it work but just know a lot of people don't need alcohol to have fun so it does make y'all appear to be an alcoholic family.", "YTA\n\nBy your own account your family meets the definition of being drunks perhaps functional but still alcoholics. \n\nThat may be normal for your family but not others. Also don't blame it on being Irish , you have some family traditions you need to examine and decide if you want to continue", "If it is true then you want him to lie. That is not right. I am from Wisconsin and we drink per person more alcohol then the national average. So this judgment is not about drinking but about lying. YTA", "YTA - So OP wants their BF to lie to their mom to save face since in fact from OP's comments they are their family does seem to have issues around alcohol. \n\nI see this relationship going well.", "I think I understand a bit how you feel, I\u2019m guessing a lot of this comes from his tone in telling the story - like can you believe these people with their shots and shotgunning beers!? Even if he was laughing, you probably felt like he was implying something about your family that wasn\u2019t precisely good. It\u2019s not easy to hear that.\n\nUnfortunately, the letter of what was said was accurate and not an exaggeration. It\u2019s not okay to ask him to lie.  And why should you have to hide the truth? While this is an unusual way to celebrate to me, it sounds like it works for your family - and jeez, what\u2019s so bad about cutting loose with your family? Safer than getting drunk in some club IMO. Hold your head up high and don\u2019t apologize for your family traditions. You don\u2019t have to feel embarrassed or ashamed. \n\nYTA for asking him to lie.", "YTA If someone telling the truth makes your \u201cfamily seem like drunks\u201d that\u2019s probably something you should reflect on. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t an AH for accurately recounting an event because it makes you see your family\u2019s behaviors in a more objective light.", "NAH\n\nHe was telling the truth to his mother which is the action that hurt your feelings. He doesn\u2019t owe you an apology and he shouldn\u2019t call back his mother, that would just cause his mother to pay more attention rather than most likely forgetting it and have her suspicions. You would be TA if you actually make him call back.", "Sooooo... Turns out that denial isn't just a river in Egypt, even though it's probably just as wet as one of your family get togethers.\n\nYTA, and maybe instead of being mad at your bf for pointing out the obvious, you may want to notice that the root of the issue is your family's drinking.", "Soft YTA..but so is your S.O. because he could have worded way differently than he did. while his family may not be judging you or your family but I'm sure it still stings to hear it, phrased that way also somethings don't always have to be mentioned to family..", "YTA just for the 'stereotypical large Irish family that does enjoy drinking when we get together ' There are enough negative stereotypes about us as it is and most of them are completely untrue, particularly these days. Do you live in Ireland?", "NTA. \n\nI'm sure there was plenty that happened at the party that did *not* involve alcohol, yet his discussion with his mom was focused entirely on that. I find it bizarre that people are pretending they wouldn't be upset in this situation *knowing* their significant other's parents were socially conservative and didn't drink. \n\nI also don't think anyone should be diagnosing you or your family as alcoholics per this post alone, but I do think it's very ironic that being depicted as an alcoholic (or as a person with several alcoholic family members) is exactly what you were worried about. Clearly your concerns were not unfounded. \n\nHaving your boyfriend call his mom to do damage control isn't going to help the situation, though. If anything, it's liable to make her more suspicious: *oh, so they're raging alcoholics and now they're making my son lie to me...*\n\nPersonally, I'd exercise a little more discretion about what events your boyfriend should and shouldn't be invited to from now on. I mean, here he was at this party as a *guest*, then afterwards he's on the phone with his mom talking about how much alcohol a bunch of adults were drinking. What a terrible guest.", "NTA your family sounds fun", "ESH, those things happened and asking him to say he exaggerated is unfair and will be obvious that you forced the issue. Also it\u2019s a lie. \n\nYour family does sound like they drink more than the average. If you\u2019re embarrassed then that\u2019s because you recognize on some level that there is something to be embarrassed about. I do recognize though that it sounds like your bf was telling his mom in a judgemental way and that\u2019s really crappy.\n\nAt the end of the day it sounds like this is a values difference with your bf and if it\u2019s an issue now it\u2019s not going to get better with time. Your whole family isn\u2019t just going to magically shift their habits because of him. You need to decide how you feel about that.", "Eh he was telling the truth but honestly my family parties are like this and it\u2019s not\u2026.wild? Like my kids baptism party turned into a lock-in at the pub with uncle billy on the karaoke \n\nAnyway. He wasn\u2019t lying tho, and it\u2019s wild to some people who\u2019s families don\u2019t drink much I guess", "Wow, you\u2019re definitely NTA, in my opinion. Some of the people claiming you are must be mama\u2019s boys with arrested development or something. The fact that your family included him in a fun celebration and the alcohol was the ONLY part he chose to focus on and discuss with mommy\u2014in front of you, no less!\u2014makes him the AH.

If you don't want to seem like drunks, stop acting like a bunch of drunks.", " Hate to break it to you OP... that is abnormal...", "Did his aunt come by with a tray of whiskey shots for everyone? Did three different cousins try to get him to shotgun a beer? Then he didn't exaggerate. That *does* sound like a college party. I think you're just uncomfortable with hearing the truth of what these gatherings are like from an outsider's perspective.", "But it\u2019s very similar to college parties\ud83d\ude2dso he\u2019s not exaggerating anything. He made a comparison between drinking at college parties to a night hanging out with your family. That says a lot more about how much your family is drinking doesn\u2019t it?", "Nobody said it was.", "Did he say it was objectively bad? Did he even express a subjective opinion about it being bad? Are you not aware that many people would actually think your family's drinking habits are bad? \n\nEither you're comfortable with it and it doesn't matter what people think or you feel something is wrong and are embarrassed. Can't be both.", "No he doesn\u2019t hangout with that uncle. But he is there and says terrible things. I know he\u2019s not proud of this. So I don\u2019t go tell that detail to my family because I want them to think the highest of them.", "OP screams 23andMe Irish.", "Shotgunning is fun you should ask your family to do it more", "I wouldn\u2019t consider drinking to be trashy behavior. It\u2019s not like everyone is stumbling around drunk off their asses. Some people may take a shot or two. Or drink a few beers.", "The way he said it sounded like we made a whole show of it though. It\u2019s not a big deal.", "I just don\u2019t think our alcohol consumption should be a topic of conversation with his mom", "> he is there and he says terrible things\n\nSo he's there. You're hanging out with him. Your family are still alcoholics and you're still the asshole.", "Living in the Midwest for sure", ">Like 10 minutes after we get back from church Oh here comes aunt Suzy with a tray of whiskey shots for everyone\u2019s\u201d \u201cI was asked by 3 different cousins to shotgun a beer\n\nYour description is inconsistent with this. Just in this example alone your boyfriend was offered four drinks. That's already more than \"a shot or two\".\n\nHow many alcoholics are in your family? How many daily drinkers? Drinking isn't trashy, but drinking like this while children are around definitely is.", "Taking shots isn't normal family visit behavior \ud83d\ude2d", "Yes I understand. You don't like hearing what it actually looks like to other people.", "Lol, doesn't everyone's aunt bring out shots? /s\n\nOP, have some freaking self awareness already. Just because you grew up this way doesn't make it normal, or Ok...", "you asked if you were the asshole. we told you you are. your family are drunks. your boyfriend is right.", "A **tray of shots** immediately after church on Easter Sunday? Yeah, that is a big deal. Your family does not have a healthy relationship with drinking, but you've all convinced each other that it makes perfect sense to rage like a frat party every time you are together. I am from a drunk Irish American family too, and this is wayyyyyy worse than anything I have ever seen. \n\nI think you're embarrassed about the mirror he held up to your family. \n\nYTA", "You\u2019re the one making it about your family\u2019s alcohol consumption. In reality\u2014your bf was having a conversation with his mother about what was going on at the party. Like many of the other comments are saying, you are clearly downplaying how often your family drinks. If you feel shame that\u2019s on you.", "Why not?", "I think alcoholic is a subjective term.", "4 beers isn\u2019t much at all. You barely get a buzz from that. And I wouldn\u2019t consider anyone an alcoholic because we don\u2019t have daily drinkers.", "I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s not ok", "Sounds like you don\u2019t know how to party", "Well there was a whole lot of other things going on that he didn\u2019t mention", "So you believe that your family\u2019s alcohol consumption shouldn\u2019t be spoken about the same way one wouldn\u2019t speak about a racist family member but you also believe theres nothing wrong with what they\u2019re doing? Don\u2019t you feel like that\u2019s a bit of a contradiction?", ">\"Some people may take a shot or two. Or drink a few beers.\"  \n  \n>  \n>\"4 beers isn\u2019t much at all. You barely get a buzz from that.\"\n\n  \nSo yeah, you deliberately misrepresented the amount you drink, and the amount you drink is extremely abnormal and unhealthy. If you don't get a buzz after four beers, you're all definitely drunks.", "Oh so you guys DRINK drink if 4 beers doesn't impact you", "Yikes.", "Lmao dude if four beers isn\u2019t giving you even a buzz you drink a lot. Not gonna offer judgement because more power to you, but like damn you should definitely feel four beers.", "I catch a buzz off one beer, drinking it at a normal pace. Not shotgunning 3 plus shots. I think you may be in denial if you think this is normal not drunken behaviour.\n\nETA: problem drinking isn't just drinking every day. Binge drinking - 3 or more drinks in a drinking event is also problematic.", "LOL yeah y'all a bunch of alcoholics. Either own it or change, you can't have it both ways", "That is not normal behaviour and your trying to justify it just makes you look worse.", "Oh I do know how to party, but shots for Easter dinner ain't it........", "And who are you to tell him what he can and can\u2019t say to his mom? Like seriously. He went over a part of his day, that was probably interesting to share.", "That doesn\u2019t make what he said untrue. You said so yourself. He is allowed to tell his own mother what his impression and experience of the party was. I cannot believe you need someone else to explain this to you.", "I wouldn\u2019t think I need to tell my parents about his racist family member because I only want my parents to hear positive things. I understand some people view alcohol different than others, and knowing his parents I think they\u2019re the type to get all pretentious about it."]}
