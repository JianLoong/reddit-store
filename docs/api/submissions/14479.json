So...yeah.", "YTA for expecting him to call back and lie to his mother. You just said what he told her about the whiskey shots and beers is true. If your worried that makes your family look like a bunch of drunks, maybe what you\u2019re really embarrassed about is that\u2019s not so far off.", "Was he exaggerating or was his truthful? If he was being truthful, YTA. My family is Irish as well but we don't pass out shots and shot gun beer at family celebrations, so please don't try to normalize excessive drinking and paint an entire nationality with a wide brush because your family are big drinkers.", "YTA. Your feelings being hurt by the way he described your family is valid but you asking him to call his mom and lie about your family is not the solution.", "YTA. If what he saw is what he told her (ie he wasn't lying), then what's your issue? Your family aren't drunks, you said. You aren't ashamed of their behavior. So what's your problem with him honestly telling his mom what it was like?", "YTA\nIt was the truth, and I think he worded it kindly and non-judgemental.\nIf you are embarrassed by the reality of the behaviour of your family, they are the problem", "YTA. He wasn't saying it in a judgmental tone and what he said was 100% true. Calling his Mom to then call himself a liar would just be bizarre and unnecessary and make him look extremely weird.\n\nIf people are doing whiskey shots and shotgunning beers, that is pretty intense for a family party. Y'all kind of are a bunch of drunks, and that's OK, but don't try to pretend otherwise.", "YTA\n\n\"Oh here comes aunt Suzy with a tray of whiskey shots for everyone\u2019s\u201d \u201cI was asked by 3 different cousins to shotgun a beer\u201d\"\n\nThat was indeed true.

Say what you want but facts are facts. \n\nSide note - if your family does shots and shot guns beers on a religious family gathering you are who you are and anyone who knows your family knows how you roll.  These no secret to guard here from 'gossip'.", "YTA.  If he called back and recanted, his mother would know it was under duress. Worse for you.  The damage, as you see it, is done.  Let it go.", "although your feelings are valid, you would be an AH if you make him call back and lie. maybe ask yourself if you're projecting your own feelings towards your family? you said yourself that what he described actually happened. The way your feelings are valid so are his, that is what it felt like to him , but it seems like he was describing this in a more jovial sense. where as you're the one that seems to be passing harsher judgement towards your family. be proud of your family and stop trying to get your bf to lie to his family.", "YTA. As long as he accurate in describing the actual things that happened, and he was handed a shot of whiskey from a tray within ten minutes of arriving and multiple cousins try to get him to shotgun a beer, yeah, sounds like a college party (and a terrible time at that, but that is admittedly a subjective opinion), and if you are offended by how he accurately described the event, that is on you.", "YTA, but it was true.....  \n\n\nAlso how do you think the call is gonna play out?  Like \"Hey mom, ignore everything I said, I was exaggerating\"   Like that is a totally normal and not forced thing to do at all.....", "Is that what happened though? If he\u2019s telling the truth then YTA. It doesn\u2019t seem like he explicitly called them alcoholics and it does seem like your family tends to drink more than average at gatherings.", "A screening questionnaire for problem drinking includes \u201chave people annoyed you by criticising your drinking\u201d\u2026.

Also, just bc you feel some kind of way about what he said doesnt mean his mother had the same interpretation.", "YTA to encourage him to lie. He told the truth and the events he witnessed were probably \"wild\" to him. Yes, his family may discuss this among themselves (as yours probably would if you reported - for ex - going to a St Paddy's day event at his family's place where not one drop of alcohol was available), but so what? He didn't lie, they won't be repeating lies, so where's the problem? If you aren't embarrassed by your family, why do you have a problem with him telling the truth? If your family's behavior embarrasses you, that's on you, not him. Either you are compatible & you'll work these differences out or they are too big and will end your relationship. You're the only ones who can decide, but gaslighting your bf sure won't help.  YOU are being judgemental and condemning his family for something you only THINK they might do, while your bf merely talked truth.", "One of the first signs of alcoholism is denying there is a problem............", "YTA Your bf was giving a truthful retelling of events to his mother. It sounds like you are embarrassed of your family, to be honest here. \n\nI don't drink, but the family I spend time with, including over Easter, does. They party and drink anytime they get together, and everyone understands that and accepts them. \n\nExpecting your bf to lie isn't the way to insure his parents like you and your family.", "YTA. those things happened. if people want to think that you're family is alcoholic because of that, well, what's to prove them wrong? if your family cannot have a function without alcohol being served like water, then yeah your family is alcoholic.", "YTA- I think you're overreacting a little. I feel like you shouldn't get offended about him telling his mother how it went unless there's an insecurity there. That's just what you do is share how a get together went. He told the truth I don't believe he owes you an apology.", "YTA for being mad at the mirror instead of the reflection", "YTA. It doesn't sound like he was being mean or judgemental in his description. This is probably bothering you as much as it is because you're hearing an outsiders description of something that you're blind to and view as \"normal\". But in no way does he owe you an apology. Especially not call his mom in front of you to tell her he exaggerated? Yikes. Do some reflections on your family situation.", "YTA. You\u2019re a family that likes a drink. Own it.\n\nMy in-laws are similar to your family, only difference being they\u2019re not ashamed of it. They love a big family get together with a load of booze and games and dancing, and everyone has a blast.", "YTA. Your families are obviously very different. Find a way to make it work but just know a lot of people don't need alcohol to have fun so it does make y'all appear to be an alcoholic family.", "YTA\n\nBy your own account your family meets the definition of being drunks perhaps functional but still alcoholics. \n\nThat may be normal for your family but not others. Also don't blame it on being Irish , you have some family traditions you need to examine and decide if you want to continue", "If it is true then you want him to lie. That is not right. I am from Wisconsin and we drink per person more alcohol then the national average. So this judgment is not about drinking but about lying. YTA", "YTA - So OP wants their BF to lie to their mom to save face since in fact from OP's comments they are their family does seem to have issues around alcohol. \n\nI see this relationship going well.", "I think I understand a bit how you feel, I\u2019m guessing a lot of this comes from his tone in telling the story - like can you believe these people with their shots and shotgunning beers!? Even if he was laughing, you probably felt like he was implying something about your family that wasn\u2019t precisely good. It\u2019s not easy to hear that.\n\nUnfortunately, the letter of what was said was accurate and not an exaggeration. It\u2019s not okay to ask him to lie.  And why should you have to hide the truth? While this is an unusual way to celebrate to me, it sounds like it works for your family - and jeez, what\u2019s so bad about cutting loose with your family? Safer than getting drunk in some club IMO. Hold your head up high and don\u2019t apologize for your family traditions. You don\u2019t have to feel embarrassed or ashamed. \n\nYTA for asking him to lie.", "YTA If someone telling the truth makes your \u201cfamily seem like drunks\u201d that\u2019s probably something you should reflect on. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t an AH for accurately recounting an event because it makes you see your family\u2019s behaviors in a more objective light.", "NAH\n\nHe was telling the truth to his mother which is the action that hurt your feelings. He doesn\u2019t owe you an apology and he shouldn\u2019t call back his mother, that would just cause his mother to pay more attention rather than most likely forgetting it and have her suspicions. You would be TA if you actually make him call back.", "Sooooo... Turns out that denial isn't just a river in Egypt, even though it's probably just as wet as one of your family get togethers.\n\nYTA, and maybe instead of being mad at your bf for pointing out the obvious, you may want to notice that the root of the issue is your family's drinking.", "Soft YTA..but so is your S.O. because he could have worded way differently than he did. while his family may not be judging you or your family but I'm sure it still stings to hear it, phrased that way also somethings don't always have to be mentioned to family..", "YTA just for the 'stereotypical large Irish family that does enjoy drinking when we get together ' There are enough negative stereotypes about us as it is and most of them are completely untrue, particularly these days. Do you live in Ireland?", "NTA. \n\nI'm sure there was plenty that happened at the party that did *not* involve alcohol, yet his discussion with his mom was focused entirely on that. I find it bizarre that people are pretending they wouldn't be upset in this situation *knowing* their significant other's parents were socially conservative and didn't drink. \n\nI also don't think anyone should be diagnosing you or your family as alcoholics per this post alone, but I do think it's very ironic that being depicted as an alcoholic (or as a person with several alcoholic family members) is exactly what you were worried about. Clearly your concerns were not unfounded. \n\nHaving your boyfriend call his mom to do damage control isn't going to help the situation, though. If anything, it's liable to make her more suspicious: *oh, so they're raging alcoholics and now they're making my son lie to me...*\n\nPersonally, I'd exercise a little more discretion about what events your boyfriend should and shouldn't be invited to from now on. I mean, here he was at this party as a *guest*, then afterwards he's on the phone with his mom talking about how much alcohol a bunch of adults were drinking. What a terrible guest.", "NTA your family sounds fun", "ESH, those things happened and asking him to say he exaggerated is unfair and will be obvious that you forced the issue. Also it\u2019s a lie. \n\nYour family does sound like they drink more than the average. If you\u2019re embarrassed then that\u2019s because you recognize on some level that there is something to be embarrassed about. I do recognize though that it sounds like your bf was telling his mom in a judgemental way and that\u2019s really crappy.\n\nAt the end of the day it sounds like this is a values difference with your bf and if it\u2019s an issue now it\u2019s not going to get better with time. Your whole family isn\u2019t just going to magically shift their habits because of him. You need to decide how you feel about that.", "Eh he was telling the truth but honestly my family parties are like this and it\u2019s not\u2026.wild? Like my kids baptism party turned into a lock-in at the pub with uncle billy on the karaoke \n\nAnyway. He wasn\u2019t lying tho, and it\u2019s wild to some people who\u2019s families don\u2019t drink much I guess", "Wow, you\u2019re definitely NTA, in my opinion. Some of the people claiming you are must be mama\u2019s boys with arrested development or something. The fact that your family included him in a fun celebration and the alcohol was the ONLY part he chose to focus on and discuss with mommy\u2014in front of you, no less!\u2014makes him the AH. He wasn\u2019t trying to get to know your relatives, he was sitting there quietly judging them, thinking he was better than.\n\nLeave now. Run, don\u2019t walk. It\u2019ll never get any better.

Re read those comments until you understand and accept them.\n2) If you are mature and expect a future with this guy  (which I understand is the case) you absolutely cannot expect that the only things your respective families know about each other are the positive ones. This is unrealistic and unhealthy because it is basically lying. If your families are going to fuse together, they will eventually know the true nature of each other (so they will know about your family's very likely alcoholism and the uncle's racism). You pretending these things aren't true will not paint you in a good light for anyone, not your family, not your boyfriend's. This is not to say you should be gossiping to your family about the negative things his family does, but if they happen to be relevant in a conversation, well you have to mention them. This is what happened with your boyfriend, he went to an event were alcohol was the main thing, so when his mother asked him what he did, he told her. That's how communication works. Get used to it. He didn't lie and apparently didn't exaggerated either, so there's nothing wrong in his part.\n3) I forgot your age (if you put it in the post) but by the looks of it, you must be a teenager because no way an adult thinks this way (but if you are an adult... Well... sorry). If you are so confident that your family's relationship with alcohol is normal and healthy, then you have very obvious issues with confidence and you need to address them. Your own fear of being judged is what is causing this issue, not your boyfriend. You are most likely projecting your own judgment onto what you think his mom thinks.  So to tackle this, you need to grow some confidence in yourself and your family activities. If it worries you so much, you can yourself clarify to his mother that the activities carried by your family are always healthy. Whether that's a lie or not, only you know it. But if someone has to be held accountable for those words, it should be yourself, not your boyfriend. The other option is to stop taking part in these activities, if you don't wanna be judged.

She did not get drunk, neither has she a drinking problem.

Your family drinking at a big gathering/party does not make them alcoholics automatically. \n\nYour boyfriend *should* feel comfortable enough in his relationship with you and with his parents to be honest about what goes down. It's his life. He experienced it, thought it was funny, and decided to share with his mom. If it's true that they're not particularly judgmental, it shouldn't be a problem. People don't drink often for lots of reasons, it doesn't always mean they're anti-alcohol. \n\nAsking him to lie is not right, and is not going to be believable anyway. Communicate to your boyfriend that you feel insecure about how his parents will see you, and maybe you can negotiate some boundaries in how much they know about you and your family. I think there's nothing to be ashamed of here, and no reason for your boyfriend to be in trouble. If *you* think your family has an alcohol problem, that is something that you need to speak with them, or a professional about. It's good that your boyfriend speaks openly and honestly about his life to his parents - something you should try if their behavior is problem to you. If not, carry on and let this go.

Even though I admit I am an alcoholic (getting help like I said, nd come from a family of them etc, beaten etc no excuse) certain phrases make you irrationally angry.
