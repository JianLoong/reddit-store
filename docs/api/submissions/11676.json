My first daughter was with my ex \"Susan\" (46f) and back when I was involved with Susan we had decided to live together for the sake of our daughter but when Susan started pushing/demanding marriage I said \"No\" and we fought about it constantly until one day I came home to find my stuff outside and locks changed. \n\nI didn't speak to Susan for days, and not through any lack of trying on part and she made up all these crazy allegations against me and got full custody and when I tried to get Lisa on my scheduled visitations she would deny me and I didn't have the money to take her to court over it for a long time. By the time Lisa was 10 Susan had already married a man of means \"Greg\" who spoiled Lisa completely and she saw him as more of a father than me. By the time I was able to make enough money to get a lawyer and enforce the court order Lisa had already hated me, and thought I was evil for taking her away from her parents. \n\nI tried to explain everything to Lisa multiple times and even got her into therapy, but it didn't help. Lisa was an absolute terror to my parents, siblings, and her cousins. Belittling everyone for not having expensive things like she had and making fun of my niece's dyslexia and hid my nephew's inhaler as \"joke.\" Eventually my family gave up on Lisa but I still tried my best until she was around 15 when she told me that she didn't want me in her life and told me that she wanted Greg to adopt her. \n\nI initially denied her but then she and her mom made horrible allegations against me and wouldn't recant until I signed away my rights. I did and never saw or spoke to Lisa again. I was a wreck and it took years of therapy before I felt normal again. I then met Jane (37f) and told her that because of my past I never wanted kids but we ended up getting pregnant despite taking precautions. I'm currently in therapy again due to my anxiety about being a father but I am trying for Abby.\n\nI never expected to see Lisa again and was shocked when she reached out on social media. I didn't respond until after her 3rd message and asked her what she wanted. Lisa asked me to meet her and I refused but then agreed to a Zoom call. Lisa apologized for her past behavior, I accepted her apology and then asked her what she wanted. She said a relationship and I asked her if Greg had passed away. Lisa said that she hasn't spoken to Greg since he left her and her mom when she was two years ago. I told her that while that was sad to hear I wasn't going to give her any money.\n\nLisa teared up and said that she was in therapy and just wanted to make amends and get to know her sister. I told her that it's good that she's getting therapy but I don't think it's a good idea for us to get close. That I simply don't trust her since she's reaching out after the father she wanted rejected her. It's been two days since that call and some days I feel guilty while some days I don't so AITA?", "created_utc": 1678161605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11kog0d/aita_for_not_giving_my_daughter_a_second_chance/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let her know that as much as you appreciate her reaching out, it was ultimately her decision that lead up to giving up your rights.", "NAH. This is such a difficult situation. I can\u2019t imagine how it must feel to have your daughter responding based on how her custodial parent was raising her and portraying you. It\u2019s good that she is getting help and trying to make amends. \n\nThe most difficult part is that you now have a 1 year old child who needs you to be healthy and in a place to raise her. If reconnecting with Lisa puts that at risk, then I think you should hold off until you are in a better place. In this instance it is probably better for you to choose whatever let\u2019s you be a healthy and present parent to your toddler.\n\nBut your oldest daughter is just coming into adulthood herself and if she has realized the error of what she did as a child and teen then I think that is worth giving another chance (again once you are in a mentally healthy space to have a relationship). I don\u2019t see cutting off your child permanently due to what she was told about you for most of her childhood as fair either. It would be different if all of this happened when she was an adult. Once you are both in a better place, there may be benefit in going to family therapy together.", "NTA.  Technically, she\u2019s not your daughter anymore, she\u2019s Greg\u2019s, since he adopted her.  Yes, she was a kid, but that doesn\u2019t fully excuse some of the behaviors you describe.  I think you are right to be cautious, especially because you have a baby you need to protect.    Also, OP - you can forgive her for all she did, wish her no ill will, but still not want a relationship with her.  It\u2019s a huge risk to open yourself up to someone who has broken your heart- it\u2019s ok not to take that risk.", "That feeling of guilt, it's a tricky one.  On one level, I'd say guilt exists so that we don't make that same mistake twice.  Something in you wants to give her another shot.  If you decide to, know that you have the upper hand and can and should take it very slowly.  Phone calls.  Get to know her again, talk once a month maybe.  She does not get to meet your daughter until you are ready for her to.  It may be years.  \n\nThere's a lot to work through, she can't just drop in, apologize and have a dad again.  \n\nYour first priority is to your new daughter, you have a 1 year old!  Take your time to decide what you what to do, you already have much on your plate.  \n\nNTA", "NTA you are entitled to feel what you feel, and its understandable why you feel this way however you need to remember your daughter was poisoned to hate you, your ex was the one who ruined her love for you and taught her to value another man and his money over you, your daughters opinion on you was based off her mothers stories about you and she was a child being told these stories.  \n\n\nI think talking with a counsellor to process this all would be advisable , if Lisa is genuine than your other daughter might benefit from a relationship with her half sister. but I would be very slow in building that relationship if you choose to go down that track. short visits to get to understand what type of person this Lisa has turned out to be.", "NTA.\n\nIf the roles were reversed, I feel like we\u2019d see a lot less Y T A here.  I see so many people on AITA comment about how \u201cyou can\u2019t force a relationship\u201d or how \u201cyou\u2019re allowed to have boundaries\u201d except when it comes to parents with their children\u2026\n\nLook, while parents have unconditional love for their children - we\u2019re still people, we\u2019re allowed to have boundaries and feelings.  We\u2019re also allowed to be traumatized and set our boundaries when we\u2019re not ready to develop a relationship with someone who has been a source of deep pain and emotional scaring.\n\nYes, Op is a grown man, but remember that he had his child when he was barely an adult, with a woman who most certainly was.  He was groomed, possibly baby trapped and then had his daughter taken from him and manipulated as something to hurt him.  While his daughter was mostly likely manipulated by her mother \u2014 people can still be triggered and need to heal before they can develop a healthy relationship.\n\nThe worst thing he could do for his progress is to repress his feelings, continue to let them go unhealed and possibly miss out on a chance to be an engaged and attentive father to his 1 year old.  There\u2019s also the possibility that his eldest daughter is still influenced by her mother and could swing the pendulum again \u2014 and what then?\n\nAnd also, lets say eldest daughter is genuinely in therapy and trying to make amends/create e relationship - in which case, it\u2019s also horrible for HER progress to chase a relationship with her father before he\u2019s ready.  \n\nJust because she\u2019s ready doesn\u2019t mean he is, nor mean he can force himself to be ready.  \n\nAll he can do is continue therapy and try to heal - and if he ever feels like he\u2019s ready, hopefully she\u2019ll be receptive.  And if he never is, that\u2019s a conversation that hopefully eldest daughter can have with her therapist to help guide her into addressing with her mother vs. putting that on him.", "NAH. I can see exactly where you are coming from, and you aren't wrong. Lisa's mom traumatized and abused you, and she alienated your daughter and turned her into a weapon. Your memories and feelings are valid.\n\nBut your daughter was a child. She was raised and programmed by a horrible woman. She was a child fed lies and BS and kept in an echo chamber. She was a child.\n\nIt sounds as if she's finally broken free, and has the opportunity now to look at everything from an entirely different perspective. She is in therapy, trying to untwist her thinking and uninstall all the programming and conditioning her mother gave her. It really sounds like she realizes a lot of the \"truth\" she grew up with were all lies, and she's trying to find her real truth. It is possible that she truly is heartbroken at the way she and her mother treated you.\n\nPeople learn. They grow. They change. They come free of someone else's shadow into the blinding light of reality.\n\nI cannot tell you what to do. You suffered horribly. But maybe, just maybe, she really does want you. Not your money. Not some sham or con job. Just a little of your time. Just the barest memory of a Daddy, before her mother brainwashed her into thinking you were the enemy.\n\nTalk to your therapist. And think about it...\n\n(Edited because I typed the wrong judgement)", "NTA Whoa, that's one hell of a path of destruction from your ex. So you were 18 and Susan was 24? Things were messed up from the start and she really put you through the wringer. But Lisa didn't know any better and was manipulated by your ex too. Sounds like she's waking up and working on herself. I think you should give her a chance but proceed at your own pace with the help of a therapist. Good luck!", "I'm gonna go with NAH referring to you and your daughter.  You're viewing this from the perspective of an adult with life experience that your daughter didn't have when this all went down.  She's probably looking at this from the perspective of a young adult reflecting back on her actions as a child.  These are two very different perspectives.  As a child she probably didn't have a great grasp on what the consequences of her actions were and now may be realizing what those consequences were.  You knew the consequences from the start and were the one harmed by them.  \n\nIt's up to you if the hurt you endured is too much to reopen that door again with her or if it may be worth risking further heartbreak on the chance of building a good relationship with your daughter.  Whichever you choose I wish you the best", "I\u2019m terrible at math, but I\u2019m figuring you were 18 and Susan was 24 when Lisa was born? You were practically a child still yourself! How did you start dating a woman so much older than yourself?\n\nI think NAH between you and Lisa. It sounds like you\u2019re both victims of Susan on multiple levels. Maybe you and Lisa can each continue individual counseling and eventually get to a point where you could consider rebuilding part of the bridge between you again. But that is a question for the future after much work on both of your parts.", "NTA an apology does not guarantee forgiveness or a relationship. You were clear and have the right to say who is in your life.You can block her number and try to move forward.", "NTA.  It sounds like you went through a lot, and as Lisa is already an adult, it's understandable that you need to put yourself first.  If you don't have the energy left to make yourself vulnerable, then you don't.   That's okay, you're a human being and you're not required to keep letting someone hurt you. \n\nI will say that while I am generally a believer in the \"people don't change\" school of human behavior, it sounds like Lisa may have psychologically sobered up.  And it also sounds like she was brainwashed by your ex and Greg, and they did a great job of turning her into a horrible little brat from the time she was very small.  Kids are very malleable, which isn't their fault.  Resisting that kind of brainwashing is almost impossible for children.  But to her credit (assuming she's telling you the truth) she is actually willing to look at her own behavior, admit her mistakes, and try to make amends.  That doesn't mean you have to forgive her or have her in your life, but it sounds like once she was away from their influence, she started to try to change. You might want to \\*consider\\* moving very slowly with her, but leaving the door cracked for more contact.  Maybe letters first, or messages.  Let her really explain why she has had the sudden change of heart after Greg left.  And if that's just more than you have right now, then it is.  That's okay.", "NTA due to the trauma that was likely inflicted by this whole ordeal but do please realize she was manipulated from a VERY young age by her mother. Don\u2019t blame her for her mother\u2019s sins even if you don\u2019t want a relationship with her.", "NTA don\u2019t let that toxic energy back into your life. After years of therapy, you\u2019re going to allow her to hijack all your self improvement?? NTA", "NTA, but she was still a kid when a lot of this went down.\n\nUltimately her mother had a bigger impact on her than you did and obviously that led to some bad behavior. Can I force you to have a relationship with her? No, that's not something you want and forcing a relationship you don't really want isn't the solution. You're allowed to not want a relationship after trying for so long.\n\nThe real asshole is your ex, her mother.", "NTA, but I think there can be room in this dilemma for forgiveness. Talk to your therapist. Give it some time, think on it. Even if you and Lisa don\u2019t end up having a close relationship, you could perhaps close the door with a lot of pain and baggage off your mind. I really feel for you.", "INFO Did Lisa ask for money? It doesn\u2019t sound like she did from the way you phrased things. Also, what does Jane think?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for the rough situation you\u2019re in. I can see you\u2019re trying hard to be the better person in these situations and I hope Lisa, if she\u2019s truly redeemed, can see and appreciate that.", "INFO You mentioned that you told her you wouldn't give her money. What did she do that indicated she wanted money? If there was nothing, why did you tell her that?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nLegally and otherwise, you aren't her father anymore and really don't owe her anything. This is the girl who was brought up hating you. It's up to you to decide if it's worth the effort. It's totally ok if you think she isn't worth getting to know. I don't know if I would be willing to trust someone who thinks bullying other children and hiding their medical devices is acceptable behavior, even as a kid... I know if I was in your position, I wouldn't have anything to do with her. I'm not you tho OP. Talk it over with your wife too. First priority in your life is your mental health and your immediate family now. I.e. wife and kid.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nShe now gets to deal with the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nYou tried. She chose him to be her father. Just because he left doesn't mean she can come crawling back. \n\nFocus on therapy, your daughter, and your partner. When and only when you are ready, approach her to discuss some kind of relationship.", "NTA. But. Is this something you will regret later? Could you maybe see her a few times and see what happens?  You can set and keep whatever boundaries you feel appropriate. It's possible that she's grown up a lot since you last saw her - she was a kid then and kids that age can be complete arseholes.", "In line with other commentors, I note that Lisa is only now becoming an adult and is trying to form her own perspective on her family history. You are right to be cautious based on what has happened in the past. I'll add a tweak to counseling suggestions.\n\nTell Lisa that you are not ready right now but that you will go to some counseling on your own to (1) determine whether you want to meet her again and (2) lay some groundwork to help you in the event that you do meet her. Encourage her to keep doing her own counseling.\n\nYou could just ignore her request, not do therapy, and move on without her re-entering your life. But I think you serve yourself best by giving yourself time to really get perspective on what happened in the past and what you might want for the future.\n\nIf you do determine that you would like to meet her, I still encourage a very slow pace of letting things progress. Maybe Lisa's views on Greg and/or you are healthier; maybe they are not. Maybe she understands the role her mom played; maybe not. Lisa may still have whatever character or perspectives that allowed her to come and be so mean to your family. Some things may have changed for the better; some may not have improved.\n\nYou are no ahole for jumping to say yes to her. You won't be an ahole if you just can't trust her again. Neither she nor you can change the past; but there's a chance you both may find a good future together. Good wishes to you whatever choices you make.", "You are still punishing a child who believed the things her mom told her. I think your adult daughter should be given an opportunity to make amends. \n\nLay down terms and conditions. Attend a therapy session with her therapist. Tell her you won't be giving her any financial support, now or in the future. If she really just wants family, she will try to build a relationship. Then you can reevaluate.", "22 is a long way from 15. NTA, but if you can give yourself a chance to get to know her now, you might finally heal both of you a bit?", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s a lot of pain and trauma. I\u2019m sorry that all of this happened. That being said, Lisa was a child. You\u2019re the parent. And right now it sounds like you\u2019re letting your hurt and anger do all the talking. \n\nBeing a child doesn\u2019t totally excuse Lisa\u2019s past behaviors, but as a young adult it sounds like she is trying to make different choices and learn from them. If we assume positive intent from Lisa, even if she is reaching out because Greg rejected her, how difficult that must be to face rejection again from her bio dad. Im heartbroken for all of you, but especially Lisa. She reaches out to her dad and his response is \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d That\u2019s cold. She\u2019s experiencing a second rejection from a father. If she was really trying to extend an olive branch And your initial reaction was to assume that she just wanted money, that must be really hard for her. I know that everything with Greg really hurt you, but even if Greg leaving is the reason she\u2019s reaching out, I don\u2019t think you should hold that against her. Sometimes it takes us experiencing a loss to realize that we want to reconnect with others.\n\nI understand your reticence and wanting to go slow with lisa. maybe you\u2019re not ready to have a close relationship with her, but does that mean you should deny Lisa the opportunity to know her half sister? Is that fair to Abby to not know her half sister? Again assuming positive intent from Lisa, she\u2019s asking to know her sister. Is there not a way for you to all spend time together in a supervised way that focuses on Lisa and Abby\u2019s relationship, that gives you time to figure out what you want from your relationship with Lisa?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to immediately trust her. That\u2019s okay. Relationships take time and trust takes time. But the whole thing with Greg feels a little\u2026vindictive? You say you don\u2019t want a relationship with her because she was only reaching out after Greg rejected her, so that\u2019s not an acceptable reason for her to want a relationship with you. so then what would be an acceptable reason for her to want a relationship with you? \n\nIt sounds like family therapy would be a really good idea.", "NTA, you have more than tried. I\u2019d sum up all the hurt she and your ex have caused and let them sail on that ship. Lisa who? Never heard of her.", "That\u2019s really rough, OP. I know you\u2019ve been through a lot of hurt, but you\u2019re the one in the wrong here. Your daughter isn\u2019t trying to squeeze money out of you, she genuinely wants to establish a relationship. Parental alienation is a form of emotional abuse, and your daughter is as much a victim here as you are. You have to protect yourself for your own mental wellbeing and take things one day at a time, but reconciliation should be the ultimate goal here. To completely decline a relationship with your daughter only hurts the both of you. There are NAH except for your ex for putting you and your daughter through so much pain.", "Very very small YTA.\n\nLisa was a child. She literally spent all her time with awful people that said horrible things about you. Did you expect her to have the ability not to believe them? In her eyes _you_ weren't there. _you_ were a deadbeat parent. It sounds like that's not the truth of what happened at all. But from the eyes of a little girl, don't you think maybe that's what she saw?\n\nThen when she was forced to spend time with you, she thought it was a joke. You weren't around and now you want to be? Oh and my bio dad isn't as rich as my parents cause I'm a spoiled brat but I'm too young to know it? Of course she was a terror. Look at where she grew up!\n\nLisa is now an adult and is finally starting to form her own opinions and observations of her childhood. She might be removed enough from that environment to see the truth. And you stonewall her? You don't need to give her 50 chances. You  can absolutely wait to see if she's serious about a relationship before letting her meet her sister. But to deny her a chance? It's cruel. You took your chance to build a relationship and it was clearly just the wrong time- too much damage had been done. She's ready to see that.\n\nI know it must have been absolutely a horrible experience for you. That isn't Lisa's fault. Don't take it out on her.", "ESH\n\nIt\u2019s kind of weird that you jumped to \u201cI won\u2019t give you money\u201d immediately tbh. That\u2019s kind of an asshole thing seeing as it doesn\u2019t sound like she actually asked you for money. But maybe it\u2019s a trauma response.\n\nTrauma makes this difficult for you of course, but perhaps you could go to therapy with your daughter? See if a therapist can help you recreate some kind of bond in a safe space for you both? \n\nI know you were forced into a really shitty position, but I believe it\u2019s important to remember that Lisa was only a child and was incredibly likely to have been manipulated by your ex and possibly also Greg as well. She was certainly manipulated into lying about you to get her way. She learnt abusive tactics from an abusive woman.", "I don\u2019t think the is a question for Reddit, but I do always think that forgiveness is healing, especially when you get a genuine apology. She may have been being manipulated by her mom to believe terrible things about you when she was a child. Now she\u2019s an adult and understands how terrible that was. It may be worth talking to your therapist about.", "YTA. She didn't ask for money and you just assumed she came looking for that instead of actually listening to what she had to say. She's getting therapy, she wants to make up for what she did as a CHILD.\n\nRepair the relationship or don't, but assuming she's coming for money was out of line.", "YTA. She was a literal child when everything went down, and, according to your own story, had her primary caregiver in her ear poisoning her against you.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since Greg left so there\u2019s no reason to think she\u2019s just trying to replace him.\n\nIf she just wants money okay, sure, tell her to get lost, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that. She\u2019s your daughter for life and you owe her a chance.", "YTA. it\u2019s your fucking child.", "a bit TAH\n\nyou are feeling bad about it - so you know you should have done more and should now be doing more\n\ngo to therapy together and at least see how you feel then about whether a relationship can happen going forward - without being bank of Dad.", "YTA. Sure, Lisa has clearly treated you all terribly, but she's very young, and all this stuff happened when she was a kid. Imagine if the two people raising you the most, that you look up to, are in charge of your morality or what is and isn't acceptable behaviour. You wouldn't have the objectivity to realise you're not being good. I get that you've been hurt a lot and it's been difficult, but people can change, especially as they grow up. Maybe Greg leaving is part of the reason Lisa is able to realise \"Oh wow, I have treated my father terribly.\" She's your daughter, and she's reaching out to you. By all means, take things slowly and cautiously, but if you rebuff her and refuse to meet her half way when she's finally potentially willing to be in your life properly, yes that does make you the AH.", "Kinda YTA. She wasn't in a sane, mature enough state of mind to willfully \"choose\" anyone. Odds are, your ex was totally screwing with her head. \n\nThis is simply an opportunity. One you can accept or decline.  The choice is yours.", "I'm going with ESH, largely because it sounds like you glossed over a lot when you said Susan demanded marriage. \n\nIt strikes me as an odd thing to fight over if you're already living together as a family unit, so it seems like there's more to it than that. What were the \"crazy\" allegations? You were 18; it's hard to believe things were all sunshine and roses except for a disagreement about marriage--it sounds like you've simply chosen the one topic of strife that doesn't make you look bad. \n\nI also noticed you didn't provide really any information about how you acted towards Lisa in general. You say you were forced into a largely absent-parent role, but how was your relationship when you did have visitation? Or did you mean that you never got any visitation at all until you were able to afford a lawyer? \n\nDid you do any activities together, or just spend the whole time explaining what her mother did wrong? I imagine the fighting probably had a formative impact on her. \n\nYour ex sounds like she may have been manipulative.  What she did to your parental rights is inexcusable. And it seems like she taught her daughter to hate you. That's a lot of damage that's hard to undo; and just \"explaining it to her\" isn't going to counter the messages she's getting from a hostile parent. Your ex likely made most of this mess. \n\nLisa also did some of this to herself by treating you poorly. I think it's mitigated, a small amount, by how she was raised: she was taught to be that way, so it's not completely her fault. Your wife alienating you was a form of child abuse; and behavioral problems don't just happen without cause. Now that she's an adult, she seems to be trying to recognize what she did wrong and to do better. Though just because she wants to form a relationship doesn't erase her past behavior and its effects on you. \n\nYou did contribute to your strained relationship: you should probably consider getting to know your daughter again--with reasonable boundaries. Maybe a Zoom call once a month to rebuild trust? Maybe a joint therapy session or two and then assess if it seems worthwhile? Keep some distance but make an effort. \n\nIf she's just as rotten as an adult, then feel no guilt in going NC. But it sounds like she's at least gotten past the hostile messages from her mother, so take the chance to start over while you've got it.", "YTA op. You waited 10 years to fight for your daughter. She was a child who was the victim of parental alienation as much as you were. And as an adult and the parent, you chose to blame her for this. You just gave up. You\u2019ve been an asshole to her her whole life and now you\u2019ve done it again", "Yeah, YTA. Decisions by adults gave your daughter a difficult and confusing childhood, where she acted immaturely and you're holding the now adult responsible for acting like a child as a child. Now she's trying to get her head right and connect, and her father who helped create this situation won't help her. In fact, you assume the worst immediately, 'where's Greg', 'you must want money', and are denying her access to biological relations.", "YTA and I dont know if I trust you if they \"made up\" accusations against you TWICE and it forced you to back down from fighting for custody.

My first daughter was with my ex \"Susan\" (46f) and back when I was involved with Susan we had decided to live together for the sake of our daughter but when Susan started pushing/demanding marriage I said \"No\" and we fought about it constantly until one day I came home to find my stuff outside and locks changed. \n\nI didn't speak to Susan for days, and not through any lack of trying on part and she made up all these crazy allegations against me and got full custody and when I tried to get Lisa on my scheduled visitations she would deny me and I didn't have the money to take her to court over it for a long time. By the time Lisa was 10 Susan had already married a man of means \"Greg\" who spoiled Lisa completely and she saw him as more of a father than me. By the time I was able to make enough money to get a lawyer and enforce the court order Lisa had already hated me, and thought I was evil for taking her away from her parents. \n\nI tried to explain everything to Lisa multiple times and even got her into therapy, but it didn't help. Lisa was an absolute terror to my parents, siblings, and her cousins. Belittling everyone for not having expensive things like she had and making fun of my niece's dyslexia and hid my nephew's inhaler as \"joke.\" Eventually my family gave up on Lisa but I still tried my best until she was around 15 when she told me that she didn't want me in her life and told me that she wanted Greg to adopt her. \n\nI initially denied her but then she and her mom made horrible allegations against me and wouldn't recant until I signed away my rights. I did and never saw or spoke to Lisa again. I was a wreck and it took years of therapy before I felt normal again. I then met Jane (37f) and told her that because of my past I never wanted kids but we ended up getting pregnant despite taking precautions. I'm currently in therapy again due to my anxiety about being a father but I am trying for Abby.\n\nI never expected to see Lisa again and was shocked when she reached out on social media. I didn't respond until after her 3rd message and asked her what she wanted. Lisa asked me to meet her and I refused but then agreed to a Zoom call. Lisa apologized for her past behavior, I accepted her apology and then asked her what she wanted. She said a relationship and I asked her if Greg had passed away. Lisa said that she hasn't spoken to Greg since he left her and her mom when she was two years ago. I told her that while that was sad to hear I wasn't going to give her any money.\n\nLisa teared up and said that she was in therapy and just wanted to make amends and get to know her sister. I told her that it's good that she's getting therapy but I don't think it's a good idea for us to get close. That I simply don't trust her since she's reaching out after the father she wanted rejected her. It's been two days since that call and some days I feel guilty while some days I don't so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But she's old enough, and was old enough when Greg left, to recognise the part she played and the you have to rebuild your relationship as 2 adults; she doesn't have the luxury of being a child her parent needs to absorb any abuse from.\n\nIf OP is punative or Lisa pushes against Ops boundaries, that would make one of them ta.", "NTA. Every time you have tried to build a relationship with Lisa, she has burned it down and stomped on the ashes. She was not as innocent as so many other posters say, she was old enough to know what she was doing and did it anyway. She went so far as to falsely accuse you to get whatever she wanted in the moment. Even if you wanted to forgive her, how can you ever truly trust her given her track record of blackmail?", "NTA. She blackmailed you into no longer being her father, you don\u2019t owe her anything anymore. Especially since it seems like she is only crawling back to you since Greg got bored with them.", "so for whatever reason you weren't involved in your child's life for let's say 8 years (you don't say when you and the mom broke up). Then you came back and she already had a father figure amd you tried to force a relationship which she didn't want. She acted horribly and cruelly to you.\n\nInfo: are you aware that you also have responsibility to her not wanting to sew you after years apart? \n\nI'm not saying engage with her but you seem to blame her and her mom fully while peacefully excusing your own absence from her life and not fighting to be in her life. \n\nHow much good will you be to Abby if you can't acknowledge your own contribution to situations like this and reflect on how to do things differently now.", "NTA", "Not going a judgement but do ask that you give her a chance. \n\nBased on the information you've provided, due to her mom's parental alienation, you were not a constant and present figure in her life, for the first 10 years of her life. \n\nAnd when she finally did have time to spend with you, you tried to explain to a ten year old, who barely knew you, that her mother (who was her prinary caregiver and confidant) had been the reason why you weren't around. Obviously, she won't believe you and wouuld rather trust her mom, who was telling her that you are a bad person. She didn't trust you which is understandable because, due to no fault of your own, you were not present enough for her to feel like you were someone she should trust. \n\nHer acting out and bullying is clearly unacceptable but also a reflection of how messed up she was on the inside. My guess is your ex was raising her to have a hateful and spiteful attitude towards you and whilst 15 is not young, a 15 year old is highly impressionable especially if the person trying to influence her is her mother. She was hurting and clearly trying to punish you for all the ways she felt you weren;t there for her, not understand her mother's role in that. \n\nI understand that you were hurt but honestly so was she - she was hurt just as bad as you were. She was emotionally manipulated by her mother and then abandoned by her stepfather - and now you're punishing her for it. \n\nShe clearly sees the error of her ways and it takes a big person to own up for mistakes they made when they were just a child. \n\nParents often speak of having 'unconditional love' for their children. I am not blaming you for not being able to forgive but if there was ever a part of you that loved her unconditionally, I don't think a zoom call once a month would be a bad place to start. \n\nThis situation seems incredibly difficult and above reddit's paygrade. I suggest you maybe do some research about parental alienation and toxic mother-daughter dynamics, so you can properly understand what your daughter went through before you make a decision as to whether you want to let her back into your life. \n\nIn all honesty, I'm hoping that you two reconcile - this seems like a sad situation where a lot of good people got hurt. But whatever you decide, I wish you and your family, the best.", "NTA. Hopefully, she is sincere, but I would be worried about what other allegation she might make when she doesn't get her way.", "NTA", "NTA, actions have consequences. She decided to cut her father off and be a jerk, so it\u2019s easy to see why Op would not want a quick relationship with this girl. Yes, her mother is at fault, but the daughter is also old enough to know what she was doing was wrong and yet she did it anyway. So no, I don\u2019t give her pass for wrongdoings like this. Op gave her an inch and she took a mile. So as far as I\u2019m concerned she reaps what she sows.\n\nGod, people as toxic as a mother make people not want to get married and have kids.", "NTA\n\n This is coming from someone who's bio-family was awful. As a result I was lost for a long time. Took me years to get the proper mental health care, and I did and said many things that will haunt me forever. \n\nWhile I try my best now, and have tried to make amends from long ago, I accept most people I knew when I was young, want nothing to do with me now. It does hurt, and even though the horrible things I experienced totally screwed me up, my actions are mine and mine alone. Being underage doesn't excuse them, and I get that.\n\nI feel awful for both of you, but you are fine if you don't pursue any relationship with your adult daughter. Time may grant forgiveness, but it doesn't change the past. Yes, people can change, grow and be better, but the hurt can't be erased. I say this as someone that has had to aknowledge my own bad behavior. My bio's were evil, and I have severe emotional and physical scarring, but again, my choices when I was young, were mine.\n\nI wish people I hurt could get to know me now. See how far I've come. But, I accept they won't. I deal with that pain everyday, but it inspires me to keep striving to be kinder, more loving and empathetic. \n\nMay you have a wonderful life with your youngest. May you find peace, and I hope your older child keeps growing and passes her lesson to others.\n\nMuch love to you and yours!", "This. This so much.", "A 15 year old knows better than to be a bully", "Seems like she was very materialistic and liked Greg for his money based off what Op says", "Cmon a 15 year old lnows better than to be a bully", "No tf he is not in the wrong. Yeah this is complicated but actions have consequences. He is not an AH for protecting his other kid his well being.", "15 is old enough to not ridicule a child for a learning disability and to know someone will die without their inhaler. Lisa's behavior was sadistic. NTA", "Nope, he is not the AH at all.", "I think it\u2019s really important to point out that it sounds like Susan participated in some rather awful parental alienation. That can really fuck with a kids head, especially when he wasn\u2019t in the picture to defend himself. If she\u2019s in therapy now she might be really starting to figure that all out.", "A 15 year old knows better than to be a bully", "The she was young card is useless when she used to be a bully. Nothing justifies that", "He's NTA. He has been betrayed and has had his heart ripped out, he has every right to not want anything to do with her. She made her choice and has to deal with it.", "Dude was 18 when his daughter was born, meaning he was a whole ass minor when they got pregnant while she was 23/24. She literally groomed him, probably baby trapped him and idk but that right there sets up pattern of control and questionable morals that doesn\u2019t seem above fabricating allegations to get one\u2019s way? \n\nIf her other dad would have stayed around, do you think she\u2019d be reaching out?", "It happens unfortunately. An accusation can ruin a life even if it\u2019s not true.", "Sounds like dude tried but maybe consider parents can be traumatized and have boundaries too.", "Not just a bully, but making false accusations against OP to blackmail him to do what she wanted. NTA, she can regret her actions but cannot change the consequences OP reaped because of them.", "She probably didn't think of it as bullying. She believed her mother's lies and abuse. She relished in Greg spoiling her. She didn't see it as bullying, she saw it as truth.", "Exactly, I don\u2019t know why people always tries to give children a pass for wrongdoings like this when they\u2019re old enough to know right from wrong.", "Thank you!! I had to scroll almost until the end to find someone else who thought to even notice that! Not to mention Lisa willingly participated with her mother, at 15 years of age no less, in those scurrilous rumours until the OP was forced to give up his rights (who here wants to wager that those accusations were sexual in nature).\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add, NTA.", "Course there is. Who you're raised by, how they raise you to see the world, etc., shape you as a person, especially during your formative years. That's just how it is. And now she's potentially realised she's not been good and has had therapy and wants to make things right but it should be ignored because she was horrible when she was ten and raised by people that seem quite terrible? Eh, seems a lot of objectivity to expect from a little kid.", "He wasn't necessarily a minor: he didn't give a time frame for when she got pregnant, but pregnancy does take less than a year, so that's not a given. The fact that this did make its way to the courts and sex with a minor wasn't a disqualifying factor for her to get full custody suggests he wasn't a minor at the time. \n\nHe also hasn't mentioned enough about the relationship to gage if grooming was involved or not. It's possible but not a given. There are plenty of ways for a 23 year old and an 18 year old to meet that don't include a prior relationship. (Offline is likely, but OkCupid and similar dating sites were already around when he was 18.)\n\nUltimately, it's the way he told the story. I absolutely could believe fabricated allegations in a scenario like this one. But he said they were fighting at the time, and it just doesn't seem reasonable that the only cause for a fight is disagreement over marriage. \n\nHe was young. This was likely his first time living with someone away from family. There are so many conflicts he should be having with someone in that scenario--cleanliness standards, privacy considerations, distribution of chores, income disparity, guest standards, etc. But the question of whether to marry or not was the source of fighting? It doesn't make sense. \n\nAnd if he's not going to be honest about what they were fighting about, then there's likely more to the story about the allegations beyond them simply being \"crazy.\"", "The first allegation either spooked him out of trying for custody or lost him custody thru the courts. The second allegation spooked him into giving up parental rights. My guess is there is more going on than he is admitting.", "I'm also a little skeptical of the false allegations claim, but mainly because of how he described their breakup. \n\nI find it hard to believe that the thing they were fighting about, at the ages they were, was whether or not to get married. To someone they were living with and raising a child together--as a couple. \n\nThat sounds like a, \"see? Women are irrational!\" gotcha meant to create sympathy for him. I would bet that there were many other things they were fighting about, and none of the other arguments make him seem reasonable. \n\nMaybe a rejected partner would throw someone out--but it seems a bit extreme based on what the argument was; and it was explained in such a one-sided way that I believe the more reasonable explanation is likely--that he did do something that contributed to the breakup that looks damning in court. \n\nSusan sounds awful. But I just don't believe he's a 100% innocent victim in the whole story.", "He took the kid after years of never having any contact, and then expected things to be perfect. And the gave her up again after because she made fun of someones dyslexia. Yeah sounds like he tried real hard.", "Still doesn't absolve her of taking a kid's inhaler and making fun of a person's disability. What if the kid died? At that age, teenagers know better.", "Taking someones inhaler isn\u2019t bullying? She could\u2019ve literally killed him. Making fun of a disability isn\u2019t bullying? She was grown enough to know they didn\u2019t do shit to her despite what her mother told her", "This kid was 15 when they almost killed someone by taking their inhaler. And unless she cut contact w her mother op shouldn\u2019t even try to hear her out", "Even if he wasn\u2019t a minor the groomin is there. A freshly turned adult baby trapped by a 24 year ild", "Or not", "He didn\u2019t give her up if u read correctly, she accused him of something he didn\u2019t do", "Fair enough. I had interpreted your comment as her bullying her father, but I see your point. She shouldn't have bullied them, true, but I do believe that she didn't think of her actions towards OP specifically as bullying"]}
