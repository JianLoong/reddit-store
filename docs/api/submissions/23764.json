You're an adult, and you get to choose who you want to live with. \n\nThe AH in this situation is probably Matt, who didn't level with your sister about his feelings around his sexuality. It's not great to keep a charade of \"let's get married\" when you are thinking you are either asexual or gay. It's not great that sis intruded on his privacy, but those thoughts were something she should have known. \n\nYour sister might not ever forgive you for taking Matt in instead of her. Your actions will have consequences. Hopefully you understand that and can live with it.", "NTA. It sounds like you and Matt became as close as brothers, maybe even as close as your relationship with your sister, so either choice would be choosing \"family\" for you.

It's cruel to act as though your sister was crazy when she was correct. \n\nThen while keeping this very important stuff from her he confided in you, that makes it worse. As her brother you probably should have said, I'm here for you but it's only fair for you to talk to sister about this as this affects her and she deserves to know. \n\nYou BOTH handled this the worst way possible.\n\nHow could you be upset by the journal reading but not upset that someone was misleading and lying to your sister? Especially since it was Matt's dishonesty that lead to the journal reading.\n\nIt really sounds like you are interested in Matt and possibly have been for some time. \n\nYou and Matt came out of this in the perfect situation to explore his new thoughts together (or best case with your enthusiastic support.)

Did you let him know that you are available for something if he were to ever consider a different type of relationship? \n\nDo you think you ruined her relationship by having an emotional affair with her partner? \n\nIf he's questioning his sexuality, why didn't he talk about that with the person who is the one he does stuff with?\n\nEveryone here is sensing that you were always in love with him.

I imagine you've conveniently left certain things out, such as the build-up to as why she checked his journal if she hadn't done similar things in the past.\n\nI wonder if other peoples perspective would be that you were trying to break them up on purpose so you could get with him. Especially given your comments about keeping him in the break up and if she didn't marry him you would. Those aren't comments  you make about a friend, so there's clearly more to it.

There is clearly more than just him questioning his sexuality in the journal. She may have been willing to discuss that with him to understand it more but you also mentioned that he had written in his journal how he found relationships between two men deeper than a relationship between a man and a woman. I imagine her reading that alone was very hurtful. Your inability to see her perspective and how she may feel is pretty disgusting.\n\nEven if nothing happened between you two physically, enough had to have happened between you both for him to be thinking about his sexuality. \n\nIt absolutely comes across at minimum as an emotional affair.\n\nI imagine there was a lot more in that journal that upset her or, as you say, \"fly off the handle\".\n\nYou mention how you truly mean it when you said, \" if you don't marry him, I will,\" and that you had been making those \"jokes\" for years. \n\nThen, to have the cheeck to say that you think reading someone's journal is one of the lowest places you can stoop to regarding privacy, given what you've done is beyond absurd.
