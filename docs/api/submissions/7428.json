{"id": 7428, "submission_id": "10csyyv", "title": "AITA for wanting to talk to my daughter\u2019s new teacher about being nicer to the kids", "selftext": "\nMy daughter\u2019s preschool hired a new teacher/teacher\u2019s aide (early 20\u2019s f) earlier this year. My daughter adores this teacher and my wife, who is also a teacher, speaks highly of her. \n\nWe just had a baby so I\u2019ve been taking care of drop off and pickup lately and I\u2019ve been able to form my own opinion of this teacher. \n\nIn my opinion, she messes with the kids too much. These are all examples that I\u2019ve seen. \n\nFor Christmas we got every teacher a box of chocolates from a small shop near the school. The shop wrapped the boxes and they have the name of the shop on the wrapping paper. Everyone knows what it is by looking at it. My daughter ran in yelling \u201cwe got you chocolate\u201d and the teacher said \u201cAbby! It was supposed to be a surprise!\u201d She still hugged my daughter and thanked her but I felt that the remark was unnecessary. \n\nAnother time, I picked my daughter up towards the end of snack time. My daughter came up to the teacher and asked for more snack. Teacher said \u201cAbby, you already ate all of our snacks. If I give you more we won\u2019t have anything to eat tomorrow. You\u2019re about to go home and have dinner anyways.\u201d In my opinion, the first two sentences were very unnecessary. \n\nThis last one just happened on Friday. Pickup ends at 4:30 and I\u2019m guessing the teacher leaves at 4:45. I called the school and said that I was going to be late for pickup and I got there at around 4:45. When I got there, my daughter was with a little boy, whose parents had been there for 20 minutes but he was refusing to leave. My daughter was getting her stuff and I saw the teacher give the boy a spray bottle, a rag, and gloves and say \u201cJack, if you want to stay, you\u2019re gonna have to clean the tables then vacuum, I have to go home and your mom can\u2019t wait forever.\u201d She went to the closet, got her stuff, and started walking to the door. His mom also started to walk away. The little boy dropped the cleaning supplies, started crying, and ran for his mom when the teacher made it to the door and his mom was out of sight. In my opinion, there had to have been a better way to get him to go than scaring the crap out of him. \n\nI get that she\u2019s joking but these kids are 3 and 4 and don\u2019t get it. My daughter has never admitted to this teacher making her upset but I still don\u2019t like how she talks to my daughter or the other kids. My wife and I were talking about the school and I said that I wanted talk to the teacher about being nicer to my daughter and the other kids. My wife rolled her eyes at me and said that I\u2019m starting to sound like a certain parent at her school that she and the other teachers can\u2019t stand and that if I insist that everyone coddles our daughter then she\u2019s going to have a hard time when she\u2019s older. Am I the ssshole for not liking the teacher and wanting her to be nicer?", "created_utc": 1673812109, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10csyyv/aita_for_wanting_to_talk_to_my_daughters_new/", "score": 4223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For this one, mind ya business.\n\nI would listen to your wife. Your wife that IS a teacher herself. She is giving you good advice, YTA if you don't take it.", "YTA \n\nTeaching is a hard enough job without people trying to micromanage your interactions.

And the little boy did have to leave, surely you didn't expect the teacher to stay any longer, you had already made her stay late. Should she have pulled the boy out by force? Or did you expect her to stay with him all night?

Are you obsessed with this teacher?\n\nShe is teaching her about the world. Presents are supposed to be a surprise. This is her job as a preschool teacher. Clearly you are not gonna teach her this stuff. This is her job. \n\nAnd yea your daughter needs to understand supply. If the food is eaten today and there is no food for tomorrow, wouldn\u2019t you want your daughter to understand why? \n\nYou are egotistical and condescending YTA", "I'd say YTA but you'd probably ask me to be nicer about it. :/\n\nEdit: thanks for all the comments & awards y'all!

Every instance you provided the teacher taught her student a valuable lesson by redirecting instead of being mean to the children.

It\u2019s an adult, but this may not go well at a kids party. \n\nAbby\u2019s dinner: Abby doesn\u2019t need more snacks. Instead of saying no, she redirected to you\u2019ll get dinner soon and we need to save some for tomorrow. \n\nBoy cleaning: teacher has a life outside of school.  School gets cleaned after hours.

This is literally what, as a parent, you are supposed to be doing.", "It sounds like you are massively overreacting. YTA.", "YTA\n\nThe teacher is fine. \n\n1. The point of presents is that the receiver is suppose to know what it is when opening the present.\n2. It\u2019s absolutely true your daughter didn\u2019t need more snacks and that if she had more, they would run out of snacks faster for the future. \n3. The kid wasn\u2019t budging at all and keeping everyone waiting. She didn\u2019t make the kid cry.", "YTA\n\nWhat she said about the surprise is right, shes helping teach your kid the tradition of gift giving. She said it nicely and hugged your kid. She did what she had to do in the best way possible.\n\nSame for the snack thing. Im assuming the snacks came from the cafe lunch ladies, since I work in food and nutrition. The teacher was right, there are only enough snacks for the beginning and the end of the day, for the class. We only leave 1 extra in case a snack is dropped, depending on what it is.\n\nThis is really non-issue stuff. The teacher is helping guide her students for manners, learning socially acceptable behaviors, and is having a good attitude about it overall. Her communication is perfect.", "I\u2019m a preschool teacher who has been complimented many times on how I interact with children (not to toot my own horn), and I would\u2019ve (probably have) said each of these things. It\u2019s not that serious. YWBTA", "YTA. You're ignoring the fact that your wife, a professional, has vouched for this teacher and you come off exactly like one of those parents your wife hates. None of these examples is concerning in the least. Stay in your lane or homeschool.", "YTA\nNothing you described here is in any way a problem.

Back off", "YWBTA if you opened your mouth to the teacher or the director to complain about this. \n\nYour daughter will have to deal with and form relationships with thousands of people - kids and adults - throughout her life. And as much as you may want to, you cannot alter or customize the way people will interact with her. She is likely more resilient than you're giving her credit for, and dealing with this teacher's slightly sarcastic approach will only build her resilience further.\n\nI have a 3 yo in preschool. There are things the teachers do that I don't love, but that's part of living in society.", "Yes YTA. Teacher here. She has not said a single thing that\u2019s wrong or has upset anybody but you. Unless you want to be that parent (your wife is right you will be if you go through with this) then you need to mind your own business. She has a diplomatic way of dealing with the kids.

Come back to me when you have\n\na) a real complaint \n\nb) experience of dealing with an entire class of kids not just a couple.  \n\nSounds to me like the teacher is doing a fantastic job of:\n\nReinforcing social norms (presents should be a surprise) \n\nExplaining real life consequences (can't eat all the snacks today, we need some for tomorrow)\n\nBeing considerate to families (doesn't want to spoil your mealtime by giving extra snacks)\n\nNatural consequences again (it's time for everyone to leave the classroom now)\n\nListen to your wife.", "YTA. I (23f) am a kindergarten teacher and gosh, every single thing we say to every child is nit-picked by somebody out there if you aren\u2019t so careful these days. You are the type of parent that would make me anxious to be around during pick up time. We try so very hard to care for your kids all day long, stepping around certain sentences and words and giving all of our love and attention, while getting wildly (believe me, wildly) underpaid and very sick at least once a month (I have covid AND mono right now from my kids as we speak). Preschool teachers have it even worse with the accidents and diapers. If only you could be a fly on the wall for one day of what we go through.

All I see here is a list of a teacher using teachable moments to actually communicate with children at their age level. \n\nWhat exactly is your alternative? You just never explain things to your child? That's a great way to have it an entitled child. \n\nShe is helping instruct the child to see things from another point of view and develop understanding and empathy.", "YTA", "I\u2019m having a hard time understanding how a teacher constructively teaching the children why she says no is making her mean? How is this worse than saying no, with no explanation? This is helping them develop a deeper thought process, such as cause and effect.

I\u2019m a preschool director and would have zero  issues with one of my teachers using these very real life ways of subtly setting limits. \n\nScarcity is an important concept for children to understand and taking advantage of concrete examples that are part of a child\u2019s experience is a positive. For instance, my teachers will help children understand why we must be careful with our toys by asking what happens if they break?  The children answer, we throw them away.  The teacher follows up by asking if that means they will be able to play with them anymore. The children then take seriously taking care of toys. \n\nDo I expect toys to break and need replacement?  Of course. Do I have budget to replace them?  Of course. But the important lesson for children is to care for our resources. It\u2019s an important lesson for making the world a better place. \n\nRegarding the child who didn\u2019t want to leave, that teacher helped the parent by not embarrassing them for not being able to set limits with their child. Rather, the teacher concretely made clear to the child that staying did not mean continuing their play.  Which gave the child an intrinsic motivation to listen to their parent. \n\nI would hire this teacher in a heartbeat.  Your child is luckily to have her.", "YTA here for sure.  Didn't you start off by saying \"my daughter adores this teacher\"?  If she's learning, safe, and adores her teacher, WTF more can you ask of a daycare???

The teacher sounds like she\u2019s doing her job, and doing it well.", "YTA scenario 1- she was gently teaching your daughter not to spoil surprises by telling people what their gift is before the recipient has a chance to open it. It doesn\u2019t matter if it was obvious what the gift was this time. \n\nScenario 2- the preschool likely has a set limit the kids can receive at snack time. Your daughter hit her limit. The teacher was kindly telling her while reassuring your daughter if she\u2019s still hungry she doesn\u2019t have long to wait for her next meal. \n\nScenario 3- the mom herself walked away. Stay out of how other people parent it\u2019s none of your business. The teacher was obviously following a plan that was already worked out with the mom and is likely a common enough occurrence. Your judgmental self just saw a small portion of it.", "OP\u2019s wife is correct\u2014OP is going to be that \u201cone parent\u201d that other parents and teachers dread. The examples do not illustrate cruel or abusive behavior. She sounds quite nice to be honest. If OP goes to the teacher and tells her she is simply not \u201cnice enough,\u201d he might as well put a label on his daughter that will follow her each grade: \u201ccaution: avoid unnecessary interaction, as she has an overly sensitive parent who feels that she deserves royal treatment.\u201d", "YTA - she\u2019s hilarious and is teaching the kids to respect boundaries while also instilling a good sense of humour. If someone had done that for you, you\u2019d be less uptight.", "She's not \"joking,\" she's presenting consequences and choices in an age-appropriate manner.

In future your daughter may even get told off by one of them, I know, impossible right?

My daughter adores this teacher and my wife, who is also a teacher, speaks highly of her. \n\nWe just had a baby so I\u2019ve been taking care of drop off and pickup lately and I\u2019ve been able to form my own opinion of this teacher. \n\nIn my opinion, she messes with the kids too much. These are all examples that I\u2019ve seen. \n\nFor Christmas we got every teacher a box of chocolates from a small shop near the school. The shop wrapped the boxes and they have the name of the shop on the wrapping paper. Everyone knows what it is by looking at it. My daughter ran in yelling \u201cwe got you chocolate\u201d and the teacher said \u201cAbby! It was supposed to be a surprise!\u201d She still hugged my daughter and thanked her but I felt that the remark was unnecessary. \n\nAnother time, I picked my daughter up towards the end of snack time. My daughter came up to the teacher and asked for more snack. Teacher said \u201cAbby, you already ate all of our snacks. If I give you more we won\u2019t have anything to eat tomorrow. You\u2019re about to go home and have dinner anyways.\u201d In my opinion, the first two sentences were very unnecessary. \n\nThis last one just happened on Friday. Pickup ends at 4:30 and I\u2019m guessing the teacher leaves at 4:45. I called the school and said that I was going to be late for pickup and I got there at around 4:45. When I got there, my daughter was with a little boy, whose parents had been there for 20 minutes but he was refusing to leave. My daughter was getting her stuff and I saw the teacher give the boy a spray bottle, a rag, and gloves and say \u201cJack, if you want to stay, you\u2019re gonna have to clean the tables then vacuum, I have to go home and your mom can\u2019t wait forever.\u201d She went to the closet, got her stuff, and started walking to the door. His mom also started to walk away. The little boy dropped the cleaning supplies, started crying, and ran for his mom when the teacher made it to the door and his mom was out of sight. In my opinion, there had to have been a better way to get him to go than scaring the crap out of him. \n\nI get that she\u2019s joking but these kids are 3 and 4 and don\u2019t get it. My daughter has never admitted to this teacher making her upset but I still don\u2019t like how she talks to my daughter or the other kids. My wife and I were talking about the school and I said that I wanted talk to the teacher about being nicer to my daughter and the other kids. My wife rolled her eyes at me and said that I\u2019m starting to sound like a certain parent at her school that she and the other teachers can\u2019t stand and that if I insist that everyone coddles our daughter then she\u2019s going to have a hard time when she\u2019s older. Am I the ssshole for not liking the teacher and wanting her to be nicer?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You made it sound like she\u2019s being unnecessarily hard on them.", "YTA-\n\nI work with kids this age group and they love the extra explanations. It helps them understand complex concepts instead of just being like \"because I said so.\" (The snack incident).\n\nAnd sometimes kids need an extra push because you know what?

YTA", "I once told my niece at 3-4 years old that she would only get half a treat, because she only ate half her dinner. Dinner was a reasonable amount for he age. I don\u2019t consider what i said mean, only indicating in a way a young child would understand  on how to get a reward she wanted. She ate almost all of her dinner. And got the full treat. And before anyone says she may not have been hungry, she was bargaining for a big portion of the cake we had for dessert. She wanted to be hungry for that, not dinner. She understood what i was getting at, and took note of the explanation, because it was age appropriate and made sense to her. Natural consequence.\n\nThis teacher is doing much the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if the treat is subsidized, paid for, etc. It\u2019s the point that she would be getting more than the other children who were okay with their portion, and that is unfair. The teacher explained it in a way that a child could understand easily.\n\nAnd as for leaving the little boy, he was the one causing the issue. Telling him she had go go home, and he had to leave with mommy, is quite reasonable. She may have told him several times to pack up, with him not listening. Heading to the door gets the point across. And it\u2019s not like she actually left him. And his parent was there. And didn\u2019t object. You don\u2019t have the ground to stand on here.\n\nThe world does not revolve around your little sweetheart. No one is going to give her special treatment.\n\nYTA.

She told us to have him participate in cleaning his mess up - dispose  of the waste, rinse the pants,  etc. It took us one episode with that suggestion to turn the boy around. What the teacher did was show the child the responsibility that lies in staying past the scheduled time. She's pretty sharp. \n\nIn addition,  the child was holding everyone hostage by his insistence on staying. The old saying \"you don't negotiate with terrorists\" applies to this kind of behavior. They had to make it his choice to stop, not drag him out screaming. \n\nYTA but I mean that kindly, in that you have realized you are looking at it from a grownup POV instead of a preschooler, and have time to learn more about how to talk to kids.

She's not being mean. She's maybe joking a bit more when she's redirecting or explaining than you'd like, but she's not being mean.", "Yta my guy. Hear me out here - I'm not a parent exactly but my boyfriend's niece who is 22 has two kids whose lives I'm very involved in. The older of the two kids is right at 18 months old and just at the point where you have to start gently correcting him on things. My boyfriend's niece has 0 idea how to do this the right way sometimes, and her younger daughter is only almost 6 months old, so she has her hands full and gets overwhelmed from time to time. So occasionally I step in as auntie of the year to provide a helpful hand. \n\nLet me tell you, the way the teacher talks to the other kids is pretty much exactly how I talk to my grand nephew (for lack of better words. Boyfriend and I aren't engaged but we've been together long enough we may as well be, and I'm like those kids part time parent lol) down to a t. It's actually how early childhood educators are taught to speak to children, for the most part. My mom is rhe assistant director for a Montessori school and I did a lot of their content writing at first so I had to learn a lot about the Montessori method of teaching, which includes how to talk to kids in a way they'll understand things, right? \n\n\"No kiddo, you can't do x because y and z. Instead, why don't we do w?\" Is one of the most helpful ways to talk to a kid. Logical explanation plus redirection. The \"it's supposed to be a surprise\" comment that the teacher made was likely just a joke - as you pointed out, the gift was wrapped in paper that made it obvious what it was. You knew that. The teacher knew that. Your daughter also knew that. That's why it's funny. When my grand nephew throws a blanket over his head I pretend to have no clue where he is and start calling out for him. Sometimes while searching for him I literally pat the top of his head in the process. He knows I know where he is, but he thinks it's hilarious. It's all a part of the bit. \n\nFinally, telling the kid that he's going to have to clean and then both pretending to leave is, surprise surprise, yet another effective way to convince a kid that they actually have to go when they're not willing to make a move. If the kid wasn't in any danger (ie both the teacher and the parent were watching him and he was in a safe environment) then they were just teaching him that sometimes you have to leave and if you don't go with the adults when it's time you'll get left behind. He wasn't hurt, he was just upset thay they made him leave. \n\nI know its your daughter and you are protective of her. I can't fault you for that because I feel the same way about my grand niece and nephew and have even asked my mom for some opinions about things I noticed at their daycare. But trust us here when we say that nothing here is out of the ordinary or particularly mean. Your daughter is likely old enough that if the teacher says something that actually bothers her, you can talk to her about it and figure out if it's actually a problem at that point.", "YTA, you seem lame.", "YTA.", "As someone who works with children on the daily, you need to mind your own business. \n\nNot a single example you have provided has shown the teacher being anything but kind.

Which means you find tricks and ways of saying things to children to get them to follow the direction you need them too. \n\nThe example of the child who wouldn't leave the centre for 20 minutes, shows patience and kindness on the teachers part, she got the child to listen without using force, and helped the parents as well. \n\nDON'T BE THAT PARENT... you have zero idea how hard working in childcare can be some days.

Transitions are hard for some children, and I commend the adults for creating a united front so that the child was pushed into making the right choice. You're right that there was another way around it - picking the child up and carrying him kicking and screaming out of there. What the parent and teacher did was present the child with the real consequences of his actions and were able to get him to walk out of there on his own accord.
