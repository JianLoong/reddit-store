Are there any female members of his family that drink? His sister? Mum?", "NTA\n\nbut your husband's behavior is alarming. \n\nYou don't drink because of your religious reasons and your husband isn't religious. What makes him think he can dictate what you can or cannot do? Very controlling...", "NTA. What a massive overreaction on his part. Given you say he's not religious, it makes absolutely no sense. \n\nI can only think of bad things, mainly that he sounds awfully controlling. I think it's obvious but I'll say it anyway: if you're of legal age, you absolutely can drink alcohol. You shouldn't drink from his glass if he doesn't like it. But you can drink. You don't need his permission nor approval. \n\nI don't know. It's a red flag for sure but without much more context it's just an out-of-the-blue overreaction.", "NTA. I can see him being abrupt if he thought you didn\u2019t realize there was alcohol and he momentarily thought he was helping, but the reasons he\u2019s throwing in your face are ridiculous. You won\u2019t get drunk from one sip. You are your own person and can drink whatever you want. You are in control of your own choices. Is it polite to ask before taking someone\u2019s food? Of course- but if sharing food is normal for you then his reaction is way out of proportion. It honestly feels controlling the way that he\u2019s so invested in you not drinking- like seriously, why is he SO worried about it? One sip is NOT going to make you throw up unless you have an unknown alcohol allergy or something. His reasoning is bizarre at best, and the way he\u2019s digging in is honestly kind of alarming.", "NTA\nUmmm.....his reaction makes zero sense to me. Did he maybe have something like a drug in that drink? Or have some kind of secret herpes? I don't get it. He was weird.", "NTA. A very weird reaction from him. And controlling too, saying you're not \"supposed\" to drink. (It doesn't sound like there was a legit reason for that, like you being on a certain type of medication). He was behaving very boorishly and sounds domineering.", "INFO: is it because you are a woman? I\u2019m from a Muslim background and people judge anyone who drinks, but it is seen as an unfortunate trait in men and an unforgivably trashy one in women. Basically, the shitty double standard.", "INFO - Is he supportive of you being religious at your will? or is he making you be religious at his will?  I realise people are saying he's the AH but really I'm curious if you've spoke about it even and if he thinks he's really trying to help you through a possible moment of weakness.", "NTA but what is going on with him?  Weird reaction.  What does he put in those drinks?", "NAH\n\nYour choice what y ou do with your body.\n\nBut for him, if he didn't know you were  considering trying alcohol, it might look weird or suspicious if you're suddenly snatching drinks and consuming them.\n\nHave you had a chat with him about wanting to try it ?  Some poeple can tolerate alcohol badly at first, maybe he doesn't want you to have a bad experience in front of his friends and be unaware of how it would affect you.", "NAH to NTA  Unsure.\n\nMy first instinct is that he was shocked you wanted the drink or maybe thought you didn't know it was an alcoholic drink.  The following discussion is likely just covering up for, or justifying, his initial, rude/abrupt/knee-jerk reaction.", "NTA. This is controlling behaviour from the husband.", "Kinda sounds like he's gatekeeping how you follow your faith.", "NTA - Big ole fat red flag.", "NTA. Time for a discussion, because his reaction was weirdly out of proportion to the situation, and that usually means something is going on of which you aren\u2019t aware.", "NTA.  Your husband sure pulled an AH live though.  Is he always like that?", " NTA so your husband is allowed to drink but you cannot? Sounds controlling.", "Are you Mormons? I am (was) which is why I\u2019m asking. If so, this doesn\u2019t surprise me. He wants you all virtuous and pure while he sins as he wishes. There\u2019s deeper issues here than this sub can even guess at but NTA.", "NTA!  It almost makes me think he may have had something stronger than alcohol in there...", "NTA but your husband is waving a red flag in your face. Why is he so concerned with you trying alcohol? If he isn\u2019t religious or abstaining from alcohol the reason why he may care is control. Is he normally this controlling?", "NTA, but he is. \"Rules for thee but not for me.\" \n\nYou are not going to get drunk and throw up after one sip. It's also your body and your choice to consume alcohol. \n\nQuestion though: when he drinks, does he get drunk? Do you ever have to take care of him, or take responsibility for things because he's unable (i.e. chores, children, driving, etc)?", "Info does your husband expect you to follow your religion while he doesn't? Or do you willingly follow it?  Do you expect other concessions to your religion? (Like, 'I won't allow bacon in my house bc of my religion bit then go ahead and try a drink' Cause if so, then I can see him being annoyed.", "NTA but his reaction is concerning to say the least controlling even. Not religious when it comes to him but applies it to you and women is my bet.", "NTA. \n\nIf he just didn't want to share, then that's fine, but you say you share food and drinks all the time. And if it was that he didn't want to share that specific drink, then he could have said that - \"hey that's the last of that, I don't want to share it.\"\n\nBut the fact that he decided that you would get drunk and sick off a few sips is not just factually incorrect, but also super weird. 99.9 percent of people are not getting drunk off a few sips of any alcohol, and certainly not getting sick from it. \n\nIt seems he is more concerned with your religious chastity on the issue, and maybe likes that you hold this belief which he doesn't hold himself. Also super weird. \n\nYou are a fully independent human who can decide your own beliefs and how to observe them. Sure, people can decide to have partners with certain beliefs and not like when they change, but that should be about BOTH people having that belief. If I want a partner that goes to church with me, I can be upset/break up if they no longer want to go to church, but if I never go to church, why would I care if my partner stops going?", "This is weird.  Your husband can drink but you can't. \n\nI think there is more to this that he is saying.  How controlling is he?  Do you do a lot of traditional females role in the house?  \n\nThere are people who are allergic, or have very bad reactions to even a little alcohol and you would not have know that.  But thats no reason to yell, or belittle you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your husband he decided he is allowed to make rules for you since in his he is your boss and you are his obedient subordinate. Whether or not you follow the rules of your religion is up to you, and he is a hypocrite for forbidding you from doing something as he is doing it himself.", "NTA but it\u2019s a weird situation. \n\nI don\u2019t drink for medical reasons but even when I do, my larger would never police me like that. There might be something else going on there that he isn\u2019t talking about. It would have been nice if you\u2019d asked but it\u2019s not the end of the world and you make your own choices based on your beliefs. Unless you\u2019re an addict. Kind of doubt that though. I\u2019d say talk to him and see if it is about something else. \n\nI\u2019d say do a drinking game out of everyone who\u2019s going to tell you he\u2019s an awful person who is either abusing you or cheating on you but maybe do it with chocolate \ud83d\ude02", "Don't know what he's putting in that drink but it ain't just alcohol for that reaction!\n\nNTA", "whoa that's an extreme reaction.... he's talking as though he's your parent", "NTA. Is your husband controlling?", "NTA \n\nI think he freaked out over your sudden violation of your previous values.  It worried him and he overreacted. It's your life and your choice whether to practice your religion or not, and your husband doesn't get a say in that, but maybe you'd want to share with him your change of belief so it doesn't surprise him that much.", "NTA, he shouldn't control you about what you do or don't do. It's your choice, but he decided to control your choices.", "NAH- he knows you choose not to drink for religious reasons, he saw you sip from his drink and probably panicked thinking you didn\u2019t know it was alcoholic. \n\nThat sounds like he\u2019s being considerate. Now, it is your choice to start drinking if you so choose, but it should be something to think about. If it\u2019s a mixed drink he might make his really strong. I put about three shots in a g&t for myself. \n\nIf he still won\u2019t \u201clet\u201d you drink after a proper conversation I would say NTA. but talk about it, I\u2019d call his actions actually respectful and being concerned about why you are suddenly dropping a religious belief and concern about over doing it the first time.", "NTA but wholly red flag batman. Your not allowed to drink?  Ok fine maybe not out of his cup but at all. There would be some serious discussions happening because nobody gets to tell you what you can and can\u2019t put into your body.", "NTA. So many red flags here. You need to look back on the entirely of your relationship and see if you\u2019ve missed any subtle (or not so subtle) controlling issues. Because this sounds like an instance of that.", "NTA \nI' don't get what your husband is all about. Why does he not want you to drink? Have you aaked him again after the fight?", "WTF NTA", "NTA.\nI mean, you\u2019re married and you are an autonomous adult who made a choice to try something. You can do that.\nWhy he felt the need to control or police you to such a degree is a red flag. \nHe can be surpsoed by your sudden decision but he doesn\u2019t get to control what you do.", "NTA. You get to manage your own religious \"compliance,\" not him. He way overreacted.", "NTA\n\nSounds controlling", "NTA - he isn\u2019t upset that you drank from his glass. He\u2019s upset that you drank at all. Sounds like he might be afraid to lose his DD. I\u2019d have a cocktail every time you go out for now on.", "NTA. Your husbands behaviour is not ok, he\u2019s controlling and has double standards", "NTA mans just didn\u2019t want to share what a whiny baby", "NTA. He knows there is a chance that you will like it, and then he loses his guaranteed designated driver.", "NTA. Fun fact- I never drank until I was 27. Since the first time, I didn't get drunk easily at all. I wanted to experience the feeling and it was a lot of fucking effort.\n\nThat said, he is assuming a lot that he doesn't know, and he sounds unbearably controlling.", "YTA. Don't touch other people's food or drink without permission. Even your spouse", "Because you don't drink for religious reasons, I have to say YTA.  Taking a sip from his drink could make him feel like he's contributing to your slip from your religion.  And maybe he doesn't want that responsibility.  Or fears that you might regret it and blame him, or your family might blame him.  You want to suddenly break from your religion, choose to do it on your own.  Make yourself a small drink and try it.", "ESH\n\nHe over reacted massively \n\nBut it is a bit weird to randomly decide to break a tennant of your religion. \n\nAll these red flag comments are bit much too, it's hardly controlling behaviour, maybe its a bit overly supportive of her religious choices but to randomly decide this is weird.", "ESH but I would go as far as NTA if you drink and eat each others' stuff so much you could say it's an habit. If you do it rarely...well I could see why a person suddenly drinking from your glass could be annoying. But still very AH from him to police if you can drink at all. Mind your own business, like.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext time, ASK before drinking from other people's drinks.\n\nAnd: \"I don\u2019t drink for religious reasons \" .. but you did. which is fine. YOUR choice.", "I'm going out on a limb I guess, but yes, yta.\n\nNot because you wanted to try alcohol, but because it's  common courtesy to ask before eating/drinking from  someone elses plate/cup.", "ESH, him more than you for his exaggeration and controlling your decisions, you minorly for not asking him first.", "NAH\n\nYour husband knows that you don't drink for religious reasons. It is natural that he should want to protect you from accidentally drinking alcohol, or from making poor choices in the spur of the moment.\n\n(All his nonsense about \"you might get drunk\" is absurd, and he knows it.)\n\nHe's protecting you from temptation, which is a good thing. If you decide that you would like to drink, and make a conscious decision to either just ignore your faith's prohibition on drinking, or to turn away from your faith completely, then you can do that. But you can't tell us \"I don't drink for religious reasons, but I want to try this drink\". You have to give up one of those two statements.", "ESH; you for being an apparent hypocrite in your religious beliefs and for not asking before having a sip, and him for infantilizing you.", "NTA but neither is he. he has good intentions and is just looking out for you on an impulse decision.", "ESH. Him for reacting this way, I agree with other posters that he's the type who likes the \"controlling women\" part of the religion, but not the actual rules. You because, well, you're allowing a religion to dictate what you do and then go shocked pikachu when it does control you. Abrahamic Religion = Patriarchy. Don't like it? Stop following it.", "NAH I think your decision to suddenly want to try alcohol should be announced. I'm not saying you need his permission or that you need to have a discussion, but someone suddenly doing something that they were adamantly against because religious reasons should be talked about.\n\nHe is also right that he should have been given a chance to be prepared in case you had some adverse reaction.

God dang I want free awards back, that was fire!", "I\u2019m probably not allowed to vote in this sub either /s", "Or vote \nOr have an opinion", "This comment made me spit my water \ud83d\ude02", "Could be MDMA, but also seems rather far fetched IMO", "No one said that he wasn\u2019t going to Hell and he isn\u2019t religious.", "I\u2019m honestly not reading any of that. lol", "Sounds like you need companionship in any capacity because you seem to be under the impression that people having your best interest in mind is problematic.", "She didn\u2019t give a full transcript so we\u2019ll never know what exactly was said.", "But the husband isn\u2019t religious. OP is", "Right, but he\u2019s not religious. lol", "Ya but you think it's wrong to be surprised? \n\nAnd we don't know if his behavior is controlling. Cause they didn't have a conversation on whether a sip violates her religous tennents or not.\n\nIf they have that conversation and this drops immediately then is he still controlling?", "I mean, it's also pretty clear about cheating and yeeeeeet....", "Ah, thank you for telling me !", "Eww lol. MDMA tastes disgusting, it would be pretty hard to hide being high on it, and it\u2019s not exactly something people just do and hide from people as it\u2019s main effect is making you more open and tolerance builds immediately.", "But this sounds more like he assumed that she assumed that his drink was not alcoholic.\n\nAlso she could have asked, so he would know that she tried to drink alkohol.\n\nThis is like stopping a jew from eating pork, because you don't know he wants to eat the pork", "Man I miss the free awards", "As long it's not alcohol.", "More responding to the commenter than OP", "One paragraph that explains why this is a pretty bad take in my opinion is too much for you? \n\nCool.

Not communicating the actual issue. \n\nFor example growing up my dad would get more and more angry the more I did what he wanted and just leave the situation alone if I did the opposite of what he wanted.
