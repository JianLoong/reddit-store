Nursing is basically \"putting up with the public\" and then add in clueless or prima donna doctors, and disturbing/gross stuff.  Oh yeah and human pain and suffering, let's not forget that.", "NTA!\n\nJFC! Comparing serving food as trying to keep people alive is unbelievable!", "I'm a primary care physician - now I would never denigrate a server, their job can be beastly, especially in a place that serves alcohol (I bartended in college), but comparing their nights to a nursing shift during COVID - not even close.  NTA", "NTA\n\nServers are awesome!  I have a huge respect for what they do, that shit is hard work and takes very real skill, physical, mental, and social.  And there's a real responsibility for safety there, too.  And even if it didn't require some of those things, it'd still be real, hard work and should not be denigrated.\n\nBut you know what?  Yeah, Sarah has a stressful job and deals with some entitled assholes out to have a good time, and it's all the worse on a hectic night.  Legitimately, some customers are *awful.*  Though the fact she points out \"picky tastes\" as her biggest gripe suggests that patrons may be on the whole pretty good where you are, lol.  And of course there are lovely people out for a good time, too!\n\nBut Jane deals with those *same* entitled assholes on what for some is among the worst days of their lives.  And lovely people on the worst days of their lives.  And on hectic shifts, as well.  Where she's part of a team directly responsible for keeping people alive.  During the pandemic?  Oh yeah.", "NTA she was out of line with her comment in the first place, so i wouldnt take anything she says from that point on serious at all.", "Nursing is incredibly stressful. They not only have to deal with sick patients but also the patients' families, who sometimes lash out and blame the nurses. Nurses had to keep working during the pandemic while restaurants shut down. Serving is a difficult job too, but Sarah sounds both insecure and arrogant. I think she is especially insecure about her job and that's why she's determined to make it sound heroic. NTA", "NTA. For one thing, your comment at the function didn't put Sarah's occupation down at all. Not sure why she got so defensive about it.\n\nAny job where you deal with the public is rough. But as you said, it wasn't a competition, and no one was saying being a server isn't difficult at times.\n\nYou were wise to not talk respond to her.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWaiting tables can be hard.  Absolutely.    \nIn nursing you literally have people\u2019s lives in your hands.\n\nAs you said, it isn\u2019t a competition.  Just keep this person on block and ignore what she has to say.", "NTA. Seems she has main character syndrome.", "NTA, but Sarah is. I've worked as a server, and it IS a pain dealing with some customers, especially on a busy night. But at least OUR CUSTOMERS AREN'T DYING. The worst night any server has ever had will never come close to what nurses had to deal with EVERY SINGLE DAY during the worst of COVID.

You're right, it isn't a competition. I would love to see her deal with a busy day as a nurse and see if she can keep up. I don't think she realizes how insane it gets, especially during covid. But at the end of the day it really doesn't matter, because it's not a competition. Restaurant workers really do seem to like complaining though I must say. I would keep her blocked and not apologize.

They\u2019re both still dead, it\u2019s not a god damn competition. Yes wait staff have to put up with some shit, but they also don\u2019t have to save someone\u2019s life whilst they\u2019re getting yelled at.", "NTA I am not a nurse but a CNA who worked alongside them throughout the pandemic. I also waited tables at the only restaurant in a small tourist town for years. I had restaurant nights that drove me insane and were hard no doubt, but the money made INCREASED with the hectic days. For those working with Covid positive people, risking getting it and taking it home didn't come with any extra money. It sure as hell isn't a competition but while waiting tables I never had to watch people dying in front of me,  for what it's worth.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nAll you said was \u201cit\u2019s not a competition\u201d. It\u2019s not like you denigrated her or her work.\n\nI have absolutely no doubt that servers have a hard time dealing with the public. I admire anybody who enjoys that work because I know I don\u2019t have the skills to do it. I\u2019ve seen first hand from my wife how physically and mentally demanding a nurse\u2019s job is too (also a job I\u2019m not equipped to do).", "I was a waitress before I was a nurse. I have had nursing shifts that make me miss the post-church Sunday afternoon crowd. \n\nThose same picky diners are the same picky patients/family members. Except now you have them 24/7, and you are responsible for so much more than some burgers and pie. They are terrified, having a potential worst day of their life, and you have to be compassionate, understanding, educate, and guide through everything. I love taking care of people, but some days I am emotionally spent at the end in a way I never felt at the restaurant. \n\nSolid NTA.", "NTA I'd respond with yeah but imagine dealing with people who could die if you make the wrong choice", "It's not a competition, but if we were to consider which is more damaging to the human psyche:\n\n1 - Taking food orders and delivering them to tables whilst people yell at you. \n\nor\n\n2 - Trying to save people's lives and/or watching them die whilst people yell at you. \n\nBy any reasonable measure, the latter wins. \n\nPlus, y'know, a large number of healthcare workers died or got horribly sick from covid because they were around it ALL DAY."]}
