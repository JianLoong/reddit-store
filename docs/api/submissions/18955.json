Comparing serving food as trying to keep people alive is unbelievable!", "I'm a primary care physician - now I would never denigrate a server, their job can be beastly, especially in a place that serves alcohol (I bartended in college), but comparing their nights to a nursing shift during COVID - not even close.  NTA", "NTA\n\nServers are awesome!  I have a huge respect for what they do, that shit is hard work and takes very real skill, physical, mental, and social.  And there's a real responsibility for safety there, too.  And even if it didn't require some of those things, it'd still be real, hard work and should not be denigrated.\n\nBut you know what?  Yeah, Sarah has a stressful job and deals with some entitled assholes out to have a good time, and it's all the worse on a hectic night.  Legitimately, some customers are *awful.*  Though the fact she points out \"picky tastes\" as her biggest gripe suggests that patrons may be on the whole pretty good where you are, lol.  And of course there are lovely people out for a good time, too!\n\nBut Jane deals with those *same* entitled assholes on what for some is among the worst days of their lives.

Oh yeah.", "NTA she was out of line with her comment in the first place, so i wouldnt take anything she says from that point on serious at all.", "Nursing is incredibly stressful. They not only have to deal with sick patients but also the patients' families, who sometimes lash out and blame the nurses. Nurses had to keep working during the pandemic while restaurants shut down.

For one thing, your comment at the function didn't put Sarah's occupation down at all. Not sure why she got so defensive about it.\n\nAny job where you deal with the public is rough.

You're right, it isn't a competition. I would love to see her deal with a busy day as a nurse and see if she can keep up. I don't think she realizes how insane it gets, especially during covid. But at the end of the day it really doesn't matter, because it's not a competition. Restaurant workers really do seem to like complaining though I must say.

I also waited tables at the only restaurant in a small tourist town for years. I had restaurant nights that drove me insane and were hard no doubt, but the money made INCREASED with the hectic days.

It sure as hell isn't a competition but while waiting tables I never had to watch people dying in front of me,  for what it's worth.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nAll you said was \u201cit\u2019s not a competition\u201d. It\u2019s not like you denigrated her or her work.\n\nI have absolutely no doubt that servers have a hard time dealing with the public. I admire anybody who enjoys that work because I know I don\u2019t have the skills to do it.

I have had nursing shifts that make me miss the post-church Sunday afternoon crowd. \n\nThose same picky diners are the same picky patients/family members. Except now you have them 24/7, and you are responsible for so much more than some burgers and pie. They are terrified, having a potential worst day of their life, and you have to be compassionate, understanding, educate, and guide through everything. I love taking care of people, but some days I am emotionally spent at the end in a way I never felt at the restaurant. \n\nSolid NTA.", "NTA I'd respond with yeah but imagine dealing with people who could die if you make the wrong choice", "It's not a competition, but if we were to consider which is more damaging to the human psyche:\n\n1 - Taking food orders and delivering them to tables whilst people yell at you. \n\nor\n\n2 - Trying to save people's lives and/or watching them die whilst people yell at you. \n\nBy any reasonable measure, the latter wins. \n\nPlus, y'know, a large number of healthcare workers died or got horribly sick from covid because they were around it ALL DAY.", "In my 10 years as a nurse I\u2019ve been physically assaulted and verbally abused more times than I can count. I\u2019ve been sexually assaulted by patients, and you get no backing from management when you try to report anything (victim blaming is still alive and well in nursing management folks). I\u2019ve been splashed with every fluid that could come out of a persons body, and smelled some very horrendous smells. Plus, people are literally dying. Sometimes young people who have entire lives ahead of them, or who are the same age as you and make you seriously evaluate every choice that led to this moment. \n\nIf I could pay my bills as a waitress where I live, I would go back to it in a heartbeat. The worst shift I\u2019ve done as a waitress has nothing on the worst shift I\u2019ve ever had as a nurse.

The awkward silence at her comment and Relieved laughter at your defusing the situation shows who the AH is.  And for her to reach out to you, ranting at you and saying how hard she has it is weird.  And you weren\u2019t comparing jobs, and putting hers down, she did just that!  She made it a competition!  Clearly you hit a soft spot.", "NTA I'd bet that she's one of those with main character syndrome that believes holocaust is fake.", "ES\n\nBeing a waitstaff you have to take all kinds of nonsense from people only looking for an excuse not to tip.  People feel entitled to be rude to waitstaff and then say 'I'm sorry' afterwards but leave an average tip.  \n\nNurses know how much they will be paid regardless.  \n\nIts not a competition but people who work in low paid service industry jobs like food service and retail, want to get out and people who have never had low paid service industry jobs, have a snobish attitude.\n\nI wouldn't hire anybody who hasn't worked as in foodservice or retail.", "NTA.

But if she wants to get technical Nursing during the pandemic is definetely harder than being a waitress", "NTA. The idea that waitering and nursing are somehow comparable is laughable. I've been a waiter and nobody died while I was taking care of them.", "NTA. Sarah is delusional. I don\u2019t know exactly when serving food became more stressful than being responsible for the lives of your fellow humans, but Sarah certainly thinks she is saving the world for some reason. You weren\u2019t even rude - you didn\u2019t say anything derogatory about being a server or even anything arguing her point. You shut down her inanity. The fact that she went out of her way to double down on her (frankly ludicrous) position just blows my mind", "NTA Yes, servers can deal with shitty customer but the dame people show up in the hospital, in pain. Does she think their behaviour will get better? And to care for people who puked/peed/shit or bleed over themself.... clean pus bombs or worse... and Sarah thinks she has it worse? What is happening in her restaurant?", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like you said what everyone else was thinking. \n\nHonestly I am curious if she tries to one-up people in conversations regularly, then got mad that you called her out on it.", "Haha wow. I work in food service, yeah dealing with the grumps can be hard sometimes and the pace is punishing. But I think you'd have to have some kind of actual mental derangement to suggest that it's harder than nursing.", "NTA. \n\nGod, I can't stand people who constantly have to one up others. \n\nThough, comparing being a waitress to being a nurse is just comical. She's clearly insecure about her profession.", "Nta, your friend was asked a question and for whatever reason Sarah wanted to jump in and compare serving tables to someone working in the Healthcare field during the COVID pandemic. She was the one out of line for trying to compare apples to oranges and have it backfire on her. You just reminded her that no one was trying to compete except her, and she's embarrassed and blaming you for making herself look like the ass.", "Nta.  \n\nAlot of hospital workers have it very rough\n  My bestie's gf is an ER nurse.   There's physical violence against them sometimes and frequent verbal harrasmwnt.   My mom worked in healthcare too pre covid, in a different hospital, and also faced frequent verbal abuse.", "NTA\n\nBeing a server is hard and they do work hard. But it wasn't a server who would call me while my husband was in ICU during Covid daily to give me an update. It wasn't a server who helped get permission for me to be there when my husband took his last breath. It wasn't a server who lowered the sound of the machines so I wouldn't have to listen to his heartbeat get slower and slower. Nurses have one of the hardest jobs and I will always appreciate what they did for my husband. \n\nSide note, I was raised by a woman who started as a server and have worked in food/beverage.", "NTA.

I worked as a server for years and would never suggest it\u2019s more difficult than being a nurse.", "A server is absolutely not the same as a nurse, even if it was a competition.

You weren't rude at all.", "NTA\nYou didn\u2019t put her down, you literally just said it isn\u2019t a competition of who has the hardest job. Which it isn\u2019t. She has a lot of insecurity, I think, and is taking it out on you. You were right to block her, there is no point in arguing with someone like that.", "I think the stunned/confused silence at her comments answers your question.\n\nHas she seen the bruising around the faces of medical staff during the pandemic caused by their face masks? How many people have died on her? You were kinder than I would have been. And no offence is meant to servers in saying that. \n\nNTA", "Not to mention the 2-6 years of post secondary education needed to be a nurse!", "There's enough suffering for us all!", "Agreed. I was a bartender for years in university. To be honest I found it pretty easy.", "I've worked foodservice and still pick up the occasional retail shift\n  \nMy worst day has never come close to the stories I've heard from nurses and other hospital workers.", "Who cares if you have it worse, you don't need to say it when someone else is talking about their rough time. Its not snobbish for her to complain that her job is hard.", ">taking food orders and delivering them to tables whilst people yell at you.\n\nWorked at a nursing home for a while as a nurse and I pretty much had to call and reorder food/put in special food requests if patients didn\u2019t like their food.", "You are missing the part where the person yelling at the individual is the lone determining factor on if said person gets paid. That has a higher damage to human psyche in my opinion.", "Higher than watching people die on a daily basis, really?", "While I have empathy for servers, they still should be getting minimum wage from their employers, if their tables short them.  It's law for employers to male up.the difference between tipped minimum and regular minimum if the tables are horrible people.", "Get outtakes here with this there isn't the daily possibility of death.", "I'm sorry, but the customer doesn't determine how much a server gets paid. Their employer does. This whole putting the wage of the server on the customer needs to end. Nobody is getting paid enough. And that's SOLELY on employers and the government. We are all victims of greedy corporations and employers. Stop blaming people for not tipping and/or not tipping enough, and place blame where it *actually* belongs.", "Some people are delusional LMAO\n\n\"I know someone literally died in your arms today, but I got stiffed on a tip so I need your emotional support.\"\n\nYeah, food service sucks, and servers deserve more credit for the hard work they do. But good lord, you can't compare that to nursing."]}
