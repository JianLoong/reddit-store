Yes, working a busy shift at a restaurant can be tough, but it\u2019s not even a comparison to nursing. \n\n\u201cSarah\u201d is delusional. \n\nShe is probably one of those life long servers that resents herself for not doing anything else with her life, so she makes it seem like her job is the hardest.", "nothing wrong with being a server but i was a server and it\u2019s honestly mindless work. yeah you might be running around and dealing with assholes but i wouldn\u2019t call it hard work by any stretch of the imagination. plus, excluding the pandemic, the money is way better than what a nurse makes (in the US where tipping is a thing, anyway). you\u2019re nta. nurses are heroes, cant imagine talking down to one about how easy their job is lmao", "NTA.\n\n> we probably have the toughest job there dealing with people directly chuckles. But I guess nursing can be hard\n\nFor this disgusting statement alone she deserved worse than the \"no competition\" comment. What a rude, unnecessary and bullshit thing of her to say... and to downplay the nurse and her job so she can elevate herself.", "NTA. I've worked in both industries. I've seen Wait Staff being screamed at by front house managers for not smiling causing the waitress to break down and cry.  While that is bad I've seen a nurse working feverishly with doctors trying to save a dying kids life. I saw the pain in her face when the kid died. I then saw her somehow muster the courage to put on a smile go into another E.R. room and was incredibly uplifting and positive with a patient who just discovered they had a terminal disease and make the patient actually smile.   Waiting tables is hard. Being a nurse is watching death and not letting it get to you.", "NTA.  Background - aunt was an ER nurse for almost 45 years; I have worked in both restaurants and bars as a waitress.  There is absolutely no comparison between being up to your wrists in people's guts trying to keep them functioning and redoing an undercooked steak or fried eggs because the customer wasn't satisfied the first time.  With the nurse, someone could end up dead and other's lives forever changed if they aren't on top of their game.   What's the worst that happens for Sarah?  She gets treated discourteously and no tip.  Sarah needs a reality check.", "I waitressed for seven years and have been a nurse for six years.  You're right. It's not a competition - nursing is that much harder.", "And people throwing up on you, peeing, needing diapers changed.  Yes, Sarah, I did ask for extra oregano.  Save it for your therapist on Tuesday.   NTA   Sarah is a bit special.", "Right? I\u2019m a server. People constantly talk down to me, belittle me, harass me, scream at me that everything is wrong just to get free food. It is tough. AND! I do think that a real skill and service that is always denigrated and seen as beneath the rest of people. That is a tough part of the job. My mom would be proud of me if I was a nurse. But I\u2019m a server, so she isn\u2019t. So imo it\u2019s not like every aspect of being a nurse is harder than every aspect of being a server. \u201cNo one will ever be proud of you or think you are contributing enough to the world\u201d is a difficult thing to live with.\n\nBut this lady Sarah is hard outta line. I would never say that! First of all, being a nurse is really tough and is obviously harder in many ways. Nurses deal with people sometimes at their absolute worst, clean up after their bodily functions, and have to deal with the trauma of a hospital setting where things going badly can go VERY badly. Nurses should obviously be respected. And also\u2026 who says something like that? Like OP said it\u2019s not a competition lol what an embarrassing thing to say.", "And what restaurant was she in that was open during the height of the pandemic ??? Here everything was closed. Even takeaway. \n\nNot saying no job is fun, but it's NOT hard work and dealing with people", "Having had the misfortune of spending some time in hospitals, let me thank you for what you do and say that nurses 100% keep hospitals running.  The docs may take the glory, but you all do the work.", "yeah thank goodness nurses arent sexually harrassed and that they receive all the support and tips they could ever want lmao", "Not to mention feeding someone on top of everything else", "If Sarah spent four hours on a Covid unit in 2020 or 2021, she\u2019d be traumatized. Many nurses have/are going to find out they have PTSD from that. And that was a LONG WHILE of people dying and there isn\u2019t shit you can do about it. The pain and suffering are a lot to take in. And feeling useless somewhere you used to be quite the opposite. \n\nSo, yeah fuck Sarah", "I don't know, I feel like it should be obvious that nursing is tough whether you've done it yourself or not. Going to nursing school won't fix Sarah's lack of basic empathy and common sense, it will just make it a bigger problem for everybody else.", "I was a waitress (for 15 years) and an elder care worker (in-home, one-on-one) during COVID. I've shed my fair share of tears in the walk-in cooler just like every other server. It was nothing, NOTHING, compared to the gut wrenching heartache of nursing. \n\nI worked fine dining in a Mediterranean restaurant owned by people who bought it with money from the type of Albanians you don't want to owe money to. Those Albanians came into the restaurant to check in on their \"restaurant\" *cough*money-laundering scheme*cough* often. Those people treated me in such a way that made me truly question life itself. I had plenty of snobby customers like that.\n\nIt was absolutely nothing compared to what I've been through as a healthcare worker who specializes in clients with dementia. I'm with them long enough to grow attached and fall in love with them, then be abused by them as their condition worsens and they lose sight of reality, then be helpless as they approach death and need me to keep them comfortable, and inevitably they die and I need to wash their body and change their clothes and send them away to the morgue.  I generally cry every single day for the last few weeks of my clients life and the following few weeks while I mourn the client.\n\nHaving bad customers I'm not attached to whatsoever as a server is fucking nothing compared to the agonizing pain I live through with each new client as a caregiver.\n\nWaiting tables isn't easy (depending on where you work) but it is an absolute joke to compare how hard it is with nursing. It's not a competition, but for fucks sake it *couldn't* be. There's no comparison.\n\nEdit: not to mention that for the first few years of healthcare work, I made *way* more as a server than as a caregiver. \n\nIn addition to hand bathing bed-bound clients, changing their diapers, doing digital stimulation if they can't poop, hand-feeding them food and drink, making sure their liquids are the right thickness so they don't choke and die, keeping them occupied and mentally stimulated and happy, keeping them as grounded to reality as you can so they aren't afraid, dressing them, medicating them, clipping their nails (and maybe hair), and more throughout the day, I was expected to cook meals and clean their house and do their laundry (clothes, towels, bedding, etc), for less than $10/hour when working through a caregiving agency.\n\nWhereas, as a server, I had to learn a menu, learn how to upsell and suggest/present wines, write down/key in orders, and do side work. $20/hour would be on the low end of what I could expect most nights as a server. \n\nI would rather die than ever being a server again, because like I said, it absolutely can suck.\n\nBut I choose to work in healthcare because it actually matters. Great food is awesome, but changing people's lives and giving them dignity in their last 6 months or less means infinitely more than serving great food on time with a smile.", "this is the dumbest comment i\u2019ve ever read in my life. how sheltered are you??", "Hope you're feeling better! And just to be fair, most doctors do a crazy amount of work too - it just isn't as visible from a hospital bed.", "Bless your mom. It\u2019s still hard for me not to get teary eyed over the patients I had and also the sorrow of the parents losing their child.  Before I got injured on the job, I started having nightmares about some of the cases I saw. Not just abuse cases where even infants were raped and killed, but ones like a young boy suffering from cancer who was in so much pain, he was hitting his head repeatedly against the wall wanting to end his own life. Thankfully, he recovered and has been in remission for years but to this day, it\u2019s still a painful memory. So while I\u2019m not dismissing the stress related to being a server, I just don\u2019t get why people like Sarah want to compare their jobs when she has never even worked as a nurse!", "That\u2019s so \ud83d\udc94 & no it\u2019s definitely not the same.   It\u2019s not just the emotional stress, but also higher risk of injury on the job. I had a permanent back injury trying to save a patient from choking to death and could not go back to floor work. I just don\u2019t get why some people have to make everything a competition  esp when they\u2019ve never worked the job themselves.", "Yours didn\u2019t, but don\u2019t discount other people\u2019s experiences. I definitely did feed my residents when staffing was short, as it usually was.", "Are you Sarah by any chance. Because I thought she was the most delusional person I\u2019ve heard of til I saw your comments on this post\u2026", "You say this as you verbally abuse people. You are totally delusional about nurses. They give life saving care on a daily basis dealing with all kinds of sick, traumatized and injured people. There are nurses on intensive care wards that give one to one nursing and have to cope with patients dying. The nurses on transplant floors give incredible care to people with myriad health problems and are the most dedicated people I've ever had the honour to meet.\n\nI've been a waitress, it's a hard job but there in NO COMPARISON to nursing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Nursing homes always have terrible staff shortages because they pay their aides so little when they work really hard at crap jobs. My mom is in a nursing home and while I appreciate the nurses who take care of her, they definitely have other things to do than bring the residents meals. Because while there is a shortage of aides, there is only one nurse for a lot of residents.", "You\u2019re fucking kidding me. I\u2019ve done both and could have made over 60k a year working as an aide (with incentive pay) during Covid. Made it nine months before I realized that it was going to utterly traumatize me and the money wasn\u2019t worth it. \n\nThe idea of serving tables and being verbally abused again (as I had done in my early twenties and loathed it) sounded like a DREAM JOB."]}
