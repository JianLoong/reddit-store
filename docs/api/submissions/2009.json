I have never heard anything so bizarre in my life. If you are old enough to live on your own, buy your own house then you are old enough to manage your own decisions about who can/cannot stay in your home. Your parents sound very controlling and rather creepy.", "NTA at all! I totally agree with your reasonings and I would say the exact same thing.

If I were your partner I wouldn't have stayed with you when you agreed to that when buying the house because it demonstrates how you don't have autonomy in your own decision making and I personally can't be with someone like that.\n\nBut again, you said these are rules you would put up for yourself anyway so time to nut up and take responsibility for the rules and the consequences that come with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Would she refuse to let a best friend sleep over and spend the day there while she's working, just because her parents are telling her what she can/can't do in her own home?  \n\nI'd be more forgiving (I read one commenter's reply about bf's issues) if the parents SUGGESTED that he not stay over while she was gone, instead of a blanket BAN on ANYONE.  If she agrees with it, then she's just passing the blame along to them.", "It is generally rude to expect guests to leave *at* 4am in the morning. Just because its your home doesn't mean your rules don't make you an AH. \"In my house everyone but me must be naked and walk on their hands\" falls under \"my house my rules\", but still makes that person an AH. If you treat a trustworthy person as untrustworthy, that can make you an AH. OP's rule treats their BF as untrustworthy (esp considering the nature and length of their relationship), and massively inconveniences him. Of course he is upset about it! Maybe BF is untrustworthy in which case OP isn't an AH (but why trust him in your home when you are asleep if you don't trust them in your home alone).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople should generally obey \"my house my rules\" by following the rule or leaving, but that isn't a get out of asshole free card. Its not like morality cease to apply to homeowners in their own homes.", "She may not be dating him much longer- didn't you see that she said they're on the rocks? Her parents paid towards this home- she agrees with them -sensibly- that no one else should be there when she's not home. She'd probably have to give him a key to lock up -I wouldn't give a key to someone when the relationship was rocky -hope no one else would either.", "A month ago in her post history she was standing up to her parents about him I wonder what happened in 30 days", "It\u2019s still hard for me to understand the situation because I would ditch a liar who took hard drugs. I would not be sleeping with them. The question is the same but with a different reason: OP, what are you doing being with this guy whom you don\u2019t trust (new part) because he has shown himself to be so untrustworthy? What\u2019s the end game?", "But at 4 in the morning? He's still sleeping. It's not like he's using the house to party with buddies.. I'm trying to imagine how I'd feel getting kicked out at all hours of the day because my partner doesn't even trust me to sleep there alone for a couple of hours and then lock up. Seems crazy to me!!", "Oh wow, you weren't kidding. OP even has a post on AITA complaining about her parents' \"guidelines\" because they never approved of boyfriend, so even OP knows there is more nuance to this situation.\n\nI think it's reasonable to not let your partner spend the day at your house if you're not comfortable with that, but asking them to stay the night only to be kicked out at 4 am is not."]}
