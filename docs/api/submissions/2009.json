I have a few guidelines they\u2019d like me to abide by until I can pay them back. One of those requests was that no one is moving into the house, or hanging out there while I\u2019m not home. I feel like these are completely fair requests, and things that I actually agree with even if I didn\u2019t owe my parents money. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We\u2019re serious, but it\u2019s been on the rocks lately for reasons that don\u2019t pertain to this. He typically spends the night with me 3 nights a week. I asked him if he wanted to stay tonight, and reminded him that he would need to be up at 4am if he did, because I have to go to work. He asked me why he couldn\u2019t stay and sleep in until I got off. I explained the request from my parents again, and he got angry. He said that he felt hurt that he didn\u2019t get a say in any of these guidelines before I moved out, and he feels excluded. \n\nThis is where I could be the asshole. I told him that he did not contribute to me buying my home, and his name is not on the title, so I have a hard time grasping why he would feel that he would get any say in what happens in my home. I more politely added that I don\u2019t tell him what he can and can\u2019t allow in his own home. \n\nI also want to add for context: I have expressed many times that I don\u2019t believe in moving in with a man unless I\u2019m engaged to him.", "created_utc": 1668129351, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrxe5g/aita_for_not_letting_my_boyfriend_stay_at_my_home/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't live with him.  You get to set those boundaries.  He sounds like a major AH if he says no to that.  Why does he think that he would get any say in this situation?", "NTA. He's called a \"boyfriend\" and not a \"spouse\" for a reason.  He already gets to sleep at your place several times a week and you're not even engaged.  I like the fact that you set boundaries. Your bf is TA. You are NOT.", "NTA at all. Boundaries were set and explained, he doesn\u2019t get to argue. If I was him tho, I certainly wouldn\u2019t stay the night if I had to get up at 4am and drive home to my own bed haha.", "Yep definitely NTA \n\nHe indeed has no say in your home and is practically just a guest. He should leave when he's told to", "NTA\n\nWhy would he have any say in these guidelines, it's your home.", "[deleted]", "YOUR HOME. The agreement between you and your parents doesn\u2019t involve him at all. And he has somewhere else he can stay. However long y\u2019all have been together is irrelevant: if you don\u2019t want someone at your house, and he\u2019s been given notice, that\u2019s that. \n\nIf stuff between you two is already rocky, enjoy your good night\u2019s sleep solo before work and let him mull this over at HIS place, alone.\n\nEdit to add: NTA.", "NTA - Your home, your rules; and I'm not sure why he would think he should have had input into this.", "Just curious: Why would anybody want to spend the night at someone else\u2019s place if they have to wake up and go at 4 am? Sounds exhausting!\n\nI understand your boundaries and respect them 100%, but wouldn\u2019t it be easier to invite him to stay over on a day that you both can sleep in?", "NTA. your not married, not engaged, and you're honoring the promise you made to your beneficiaries that got you the house in the first place. It was fine for him to ask but you set the boundaries, he needs to except it.", "NTA.\n\nHe doesn't have a say in the guidelines because he didn't help assist in buying the house. You and your parents contributed to the payment, so your rules. Not his. And what kind of bs excuse is feeling \"excluded\"??", "Why are you letting your parents dictate how you live your life like this? Just.. wow I mean I guess it's your home and you can do whatever you(r parents) want but I would personally break up with you over this.\nHe's your boyfriend of 2 years it makes sense that he expects you to trust him enough to let him sleep for a couple hours hes not being crazy or pretending like he owns your house because he has normal reasonable expectations. \nESH hes the asshole for asking to have a say in the rules of your house but honestly you are ta for expecting him to be ok with them and also for being petty and bringing up house ownership \nAlso if you dont like him why are you dating", "Nta for following your parents rules. What I am wondering though, why are these rules there? Might as well just lived at home then \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if they bought you a house where you can LIVE then there shouldn't be any rules if you ask me. If they want you to come up with funds first they should have waited or just not do it at all. It just strikes me as odd they buy a house for you where they apply living at home rules. Maybe I'm just weird lol", "ESH. Your house, your rules. However, what are you doing with this guy? You\u2019ve been with this guy for 2 years & you don\u2019t trust him in your house for a few hours unless you\u2019re there to watch him? If I were your boyfriend, I\u2019d find someone who trusted me.", "YTA and your parents are too tbh. \n\nHe's not just some stranger, he's your partner of 2 years.\n\nYou also should not let him stay on a work night if you have to kick him out at 4am, that's just a weird request.", "A few things to unpack here.\n\nYour parents assisted you in purchasing the place, but ultimately it is YOUR HOME. Why did you abide to the rules that no one can move in/stay when you are not? That is something that is quite obviously going to backfire, and not just in \"thin\" cases like this.\n\nOnto the situation: you have to leave at 4 a.m. but your boyfriend - of 2 years together - arrived when you were there/he was invited to come. It's not like he simply went to your place alone. I see NO REASON why he cannot just keep sleeping and leave when he wakes up and close the door behind him, rather than being forced to leave when you do. \n\nYou're not 100% TA here but you are not in the right and this arrangement is bound to fail.", "NTA. You are keeping a promise to your parents. You are not married. There isn\u2019t an engagement. I am not sure why he would push boundaries that are set?", "NTA, keep those boundaries and make sure he\u2019s worth your time, based on this?", "ESH (mostly you) and that is a weird agreement to make with your parents. That does not seem like a healthy relationship for an adult to have. That their parents dictate how the home they own is run. 2 years and you don't trust your boyfriend to sleep at your house past 4am. You have major relationship issues if that's the case. While BF wouldn't have say in arrangements that definitely something I would have talked to my SO about if I was even willing to consider that stipulation from parents (which I wouldn't).", "Ultimatley, NTA. Your house, your rules, and you're right, he contributes nothing to the house so I'm confused why he thought he'd have a say. That being said, something like this would be a dealbreaker for a lot of people and reasonably so. Just something to think about", "YTA\n\nBut it does not matter, he will find someone better easily.", "If you've been together for two years I think it's weird you wouldn't let him stay there unsupervised unless you have a reason for it.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the house is yours, my issue would be with my adult girlfriend's lack of trust. And how beholden she is to her parents unreasonable rules. \n\nId rather go home and sleep than have to get up at 4AM because I absolutely can't be there alone.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous.\n\nYTA", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you have boundaries and he doesn't have as much ambition as you would like to see in him.  I can see why the relationship is rocky.", "ESH\n\nIt is not normal for a longtime boyfriend/girlfriend to not be allowed to sleep in for a few hours because the other person has early commitments. Presumably you trust them enough so that they will lock the door when they leave. Most people would also allow their long time friends to come early if need be and so be alone for an hour or few hours if it was convenient.\n\nI assumed that the issue was your boyfriend wanting to stay at your home for a week or more when you are gone which is a completely different expectation.\n\nMy parents also helped me with my downpayment and also advised me on different places we looked at. But that is where the interference and control stopped and frankly I would have laughed if they told me who I could have over and for how long. If I am old enough and responsible enough to be a homeowner and pay mortgage and taxes, I am responsible enough to know who to trust to be in my home.", "YTA. Im not sure if this is for real. He has to wake up at 4am if he spends the night with you? I would be so disrespected I would have broken up with you immediately?\n\nPolitely tell him that you dont tell him what he can or cant at his place? Lol. Im sure he doenst kick you out at 4am.", "NTA at all.  Your house, your rules. And he knows this. And you said your relationship is rocky anyway. Tell him to get packing...", "NTA of YOU don't want him there. Your parents have NO right to make any requests or demands just because they helped you with the down payment. I have never heard anything so bizarre in my life. If you are old enough to live on your own, buy your own house then you are old enough to manage your own decisions about who can/cannot stay in your home. Your parents sound very controlling and rather creepy.", "NTA at all! I totally agree with your reasonings and I would say the exact same thing. He comes across as weirdly entitled in my opinion, for someone who is boyfriend status, not \"partner\" \"fiance\" or \"spouse\".", "NTA. But you said yourself these would be boundaries you'd set for yourself even if your parents weren't involved so it's time to stand by your own decision and not \"blame\" your parents for it.\n\nEdit: to be clear, I think your parents having any say in what you do with your own house is absurd and probably the root of your boundary issues as a whole. If I were your partner I wouldn't have stayed with you when you agreed to that when buying the house because it demonstrates how you don't have autonomy in your own decision making and I personally can't be with someone like that.\n\nBut again, you said these are rules you would put up for yourself anyway so time to nut up and take responsibility for the rules and the consequences that come with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
