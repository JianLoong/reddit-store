I have never heard anything so bizarre in my life.

If I were your partner I wouldn't have stayed with you when you agreed to that when buying the house because it demonstrates how you don't have autonomy in your own decision making and I personally can't be with someone like that.\n\nBut again, you said these are rules you would put up for yourself anyway so time to nut up and take responsibility for the rules and the consequences that come with them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you treat a trustworthy person as untrustworthy, that can make you an AH. OP's rule treats their BF as untrustworthy (esp considering the nature and length of their relationship), and massively inconveniences him. Of course he is upset about it! Maybe BF is untrustworthy in which case OP isn't an AH (but why trust him in your home when you are asleep if you don't trust them in your home alone).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople should generally obey \"my house my rules\" by following the rule or leaving, but that isn't a get out of asshole free card.

But you don\u2019t trust him and your parents don\u2019t? That kind of would probably hurt a lot of people I\u2019m just an emotional level. Two years is pretty committed and a good amount of time to request that amount of trust to a certain extent.\n\nI do think this is a moment for you to reflect on the future you envision with him. Because in general Couples that are serious who might not be interested in marriage or couples who are serious and are interested in marriage down the road, they normally do you go to say in certain things like what he\u2019s suggesting. Or rather that\u2019s where couples want to build to and it seems like you\u2019re not interested in that with the way you are responding to him as well. What your actions basically says you don\u2019t trust him. And to have been in a committed relationship for two years it probably hurts that person.

Like next time have a don\u2019t invite him to stay over if you have an unreasonable wake up call at that time. It\u2019s kind of like if someone were to invite you over for a nice dinner or lunch but then expect you to cook it at their house without notice. That\u2019s like a really bad example but it\u2019s just really weird idiosyncratic things like this that seem like why would you even do that at it it doesn\u2019t seem like a logical progression of thought or make any sense", "I won\u2019t add a judgment but it is a bit weird on your part.

That\u2019s why she can\u2019t trust him.", "No I\u2019m an responding to the comment above me, who say they wouldn\u2019t ask a ONS to leave home with them if they had to leave at 4 am", "While you\u2019re clearly wrong about what happened, even IF he asked her, she should still be saying \u201cno, sorry I have to wake up really early tomorrow, it\u2019s not a good night\u201d if she has a rule about not trusting anyone in her home.", "Yeah it's literally why the parents created the rule, because she isn't handling her business and so their contribution was entirely based on it not becoming a drug house. Like it sounds like the lack of trust is flowing downstream, because how can her parents trust her when she won't end a dysfunctional relationship?", "They wouldn't engage in a ONS in the first place if they had to kick them out at 4 am.", "Yep. So let me add something else. \n\nShe was an addict as well. \n\nBoth her and her boyfriend decided to get clean together.\n\n They stayed clean for 1.5 years\n\nHe then lost his job and HASNT BEEN ABLE TO GET A JOB FOR OVER A YEAR. \n\nHe started being erratic and showing weird behaviour in the past 4 months (I am assuming that is what OP means with having troubles unrelated to this AiTA) \n\nHe admitted on halloween that he'd been using again. \n(Idk if the rules of this sub will delete my comment but he did heavy dr*gs) probably injected as from what I read.\n\nNow this is all critical information. And mostly it explains why she might not like her boyfriend much anymore. \n\nIf she plans to stay clean she needs to dump him. Addicts cannot live with ex addicts trying to stay clean. And that is fact. Bf doesn't seem interested in getting clean again\n\nNow we have most of the missing info. \n\nAll that's left to understand is wether she uses her parents excuse to keep the boundary up because she can't feel \"safe\" being honest and direct.", "I think your last sentence hit the nail on the head. She feels like she can\u2019t be direct with him, so she puts it on her parents instead.", "NTA.   And i dont need to tell you all about my living situation to say so, unlike so many others here.\n\nStick w/ what feels right to you.", "YTA I would be offended if I dated someone for 2 months and they didn't let me sleep in when staying the night. Like, do you not trust the guy after 2 years?", "YTA\u2026how old are you?  I don\u2019t care if your parents helped or not, they do not get to dictate the rules of your home.  If you wanted to continue to still live under their rules, you should have stayed living with them.  I have to wonder if this rule was created specifically for this boyfriend?", "NTA - your parents are very controlling.  they 'lent' you the deposit for the house but put conditions on the use of the house?  Those were their terms that you agreed to.  I'd be paying them back ASAP\n\nI've never heard such a thing.  What are they concerned you'd do in this house? \n\nIn my country you'd be encouraged to have housemates to help earn an income form the property and give them back the deposit faster.\n\nIf he wants to sleep late - why can't you both stay at his place and you get up early then?  You can spend the night without moving in.\n\nYour bf wants you to ignore your agreement with parents for his comfort and convenience.  you reminded him he had no say.", "NTA. He\u2019s feeling insecure about this. A partner who does that is not ok. There will be times your career or contribution will exceed his..do you have to underplay that for his ego? Don\u2019t invite him over anymore.", "NTA Your house, your rules. And on that note, quite why you allow your parents to set rules in your house when you are an independent adult is another matter. Their money is a gift, and you shouldn't let them control you with it. That's abusive.\n\n> I don\u2019t believe in moving in with a man unless I\u2019m engaged to him.\n\nErm, if he's staying over regularly then you are effectively co-habiting. I'm not sure your principles have the firm foundation you think they do. But that's me being picky, and perhaps a little surprised that you have boundaries with partners but won't set them with your parents.", "NTA. It's your house, it's your rules.", "YTA,  your bf of 2 years just wanted to sleep in after being with you. That's it. You can have whatever boundary you want but this seems like a foolish relationship destroying act for no real reason past you want it this way.", "He can sleep over multiple times a week but not officially live with you? Ok.\n\nBut if he does sleepover he has to wake up and leave by 4am? That\u2019s crazy and why YTA.\n\nAnd you agree with your parents that no one, including your bf of 2yrs, should be in your house while you\u2019re not there? Showing zero trust for a partner of 2yrs. Why are you still together?!", "NTA", "YTA and so are your parents this is not a fair or reasonable request. No one there when you aren\u2019t? Not even landlords can stipulate that reasonably. Helping with the down payment does not make them owners.", "NTA", "NTA, it's reasonable to not want someone in your home when you aren't there and he does not get a say.\n\nThat said, your parents shouldn't be able to dictate house rules over a dp loan and if you don't trust your bf to be home alone you should just break up already.", "For the record, you didn\u2019t point out his financial instability. You pointed out that he had no stake in the house you and your parents bought. Those are two different things.\n\nNTA. Your house, your rules. But it sounds like your parents used the down payment to get you away from this guy. If you don\u2019t see a future with him, move on.", "Info: Do you have reason to think he would trash your house? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re implying when you say he can\u2019t be alone in there for *any* length of time.", "NTA but why are you with him? He\u2019s an active addict until 1 week ago!? No wonder your parents don\u2019t want him there especially without you.", "OP I think you're asking the wrong questions. From reading the comments it appears you are a recovering meth addict, currently clean. And your boyfriend who you used to do drugs with, got clean and has relapsed. He's also unemployed. I'd guess part of the reason you don't want him in your house while you aren't there is a suspicion he might steal and sell some of your things to pay for his habit. A reasonable concern.\nThe question you really should be asking yourself is whether it's good for your own long term health for you to stay with a guy who may pull you back into addiction yourself?", "YTA you\u2019ve been dating for 2 years? it feels like you\u2019re using your parents\u2019 request as an excuse; I feel like if you told them that your boyfriend of 2 years would be sleeping in for a few hours there, they\u2019d be completely fine with that.", "ESH, you agreed to a very invasive thing that is, frankly, ridiculous if your parents are not named on the home. Even if they are, you have to have an agreement, which this is something you shouldn't agree to.  That said, your boyfriend on the rocks sucks too, it's your house and rules after all. Your parents suck for making this invasive demand.", "YTA. If you can't trust this guy to be in your house alone for a couple of hours after two years of dating, then you should just break up. Your parents' rules are ridiculous and are no excuse. \n\nYou're right that he doesn't have any legal or financial interest, but this is your long-term partner. Do you not place any importance on their comfort or happiness? Doesn't sound like much of a relationship from where I'm sitting.", "NTA, your house your rules, but it is pretty damned weird that you have rules from your parents about not being able to leave someone (boyfriend of 2 years!) in the house alone.  Feels like there's a lot missing here, because that's mega controlling.   I wonder if it's pointed straight at bad boyfriend from them - like they don't want OP to end up with tenant issues or something.  They are both doing you a favor and paying you for the privilege of controlling your private life.", "I don\u2019t think yta because it\u2019s your house your rules, but I think it\u2019s weird your parents are dictating who can be at your house. I guess them saying someone can\u2019t live with you is ok? But why aren\u2019t you allowed to have people you trust over if you aren\u2019t there. You aren\u2019t allowed to have friends come visit? But again\u2026what do your parents matter if it comes from you.", "NTA, even though I wholeheartedly disagree with \"we'll help! But these are our conditions!\" When it comes to how someone's lives their life, within reason! But still, NTA. Boyfriend sounds controlling.", "NTA and well done for sticking to your guns!", "girl run anyone trying to tell you what to with your own is a red flag if I've ever seen one nta", "NTA.\n\nBecause these aren't your rules with him, so no, he does not get a say. These are between you and your parents.", "NTA.  Your home, your rules.  PERIOD!", "Except it's not just a couple of hours to sleep in. He wants to stay there until she gets off work, so the whole day.", "I was confused by the \u201cbefore moving out\u201d bit, but since OP says she doesn\u2019t want to cohabitate before engagement, she wouldn\u2019t have been living with her boyfriend \u2014 this would have been her moving out of her parents\u2019 place. And it\u2019s bizarre (and inappropriately demanding) that he thinks he should have been consulted about her house rules, though it\u2019s also his choice whether he wants to put up with them while continuing in a relationship with her.\n\nI can understand why OP\u2019s parents put the rule in place: they\u2019re supporting their daughter getting her own place, not someone else as well, and cohabitation can make ownership and control murky. And they don\u2019t want to go down the \u201che\u2019s not living here, he just stays over a lot!\u201d road. The result is micromanagey but OP doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it, and it can be easier for her to make her parents be the bad guy when she\u2019s holding the line against her boyfriend.\n\nBut \u201cstay over but you have to leave at 4am\u201d doesn\u2019t sound appealing, and she runs the risk of him agreeing to it and then refusing to leave while she has to head off to work.\n\nETA: OP\u2019s post history mentions that her boyfriend has relapsed into drug use, which gives significant context to the \u201cnobody else alone in the house while OP is out\u201d rule.", "I don't blame her parents for wanting their daughter to distance herself from her meth addicted unemployed boyfriend.", "Right? It\u2019s weird. To say she can\u2019t have anyone over while she\u2019s not there? Like what the fuck. Sounds like a control thing. I know people who\u2019s parents have given the down-payment and it\u2019s not like they treat it as their home their kid is staying in. What\u2019s with the childish rules.", "Why would you date someone for 2 years if you don't trust them in your house alone? Like if I was the bf I'd be upset too. The rules also mean he can't move in right? So what does she expect their future to look like?\n\nLike it's not just that one particular rule but how, after 2 years, she doesn't seem particularly serious about him and I think these rules are him realizing that\n\nEDIT: After posting I read through some posts of theirs and the bf had a relapse. Given those circumstances it's a bit more understandable I suppose.", "Same. Don't ya love it when people assume you don't like each other bc you're not married. SO annoying!", "Yeah that drug habit context absolutely changes every thing. Normally I\u2019d think this is controlling but I wouldn\u2019t want my investment to allow me to be leeched off by proxy by a meth addict.\n\nI used to hide behind my parents rules to get out of things, but I was 17 at then, not a mortgage but I\u2019m guessing he has some hold over her emotionally where it\u2019s taking her time to work up the strength to end it.", "Well that\u2019s some context that definitely changes things. So I guess it\u2019s a case less of OP doing what mummy and daddy want so much as using mummy daddy\u2019s rules as an excuse to distance herself until she feels comfortable dumping this guy.", "I personally would dump someone who doesn\u2019t think enough of me to sleep in at their place for a couple of hours, after 2 years of dating. to each their own", "I don\u2019t even have a single friend I wouldn\u2019t trust in my house alone.", "That\u2019s a great question.", "This is exactly why me and my partner are waiting til we've lived together a while to discuss engagement", "Check out OP\u2019s post history.

If OP wants to include relevant information, that\u2019s on them. I personally would also dump someone who has relapsed and lied about it; idk what OP wants us to do with this.

They didn\u2019t outright buy you the house, they helped you with a down payment. That shouldn\u2019t mean they get to dictate how you live.", "ESH. The guidelines from your parents are silly and a way for them to get to have an unnecessary say in your personal life, so congrats you\u2019re a dupe. A boyfriend should be able to sleep in when you go to work, especially if you\u2019re getting up at the butt crack of dawn. Your boyfriend doesn\u2019t need to have a say in the stupid guidelines you let yourself get sucked into. Take it from me you have set yourself up for being controlled for years. How long will it take you to pay off this townhouse? More or less than ten years? You going to kick every friend and lover out when you\u2019re thirty? Poor foolish OP.

That's a red flag for him being controlling.", "Having a parental rule to hide behind, when young, can help a person establish and defend boundaries.\n\nThe drug use mentioned in another post is a big red flag. This boyfriend is a boundary pusher. He knows about the house rule and is pushing her to disregard it. It's in the same category as insisting on driving her car or using her debit card. My vote is NTA.", "NTA Of course he gets no say. He didn't contribute to a down payment, his name is not on the deed, he pays no bills, doesn't live there and you are not engaged. Your parents are right about you stopping anyone from moving in as of yet, until you have established your dominion over your own home and stopped the leeches moving in on you.", "NTA. There is a lot of information missing here. I think your parents boundaries are reasonable, as you were formerly addicted to drugs. They need time to build that trust but also want to help you stay on the straight and narrow. Also, your boyfriend is in active addiction after a recent relapse. It\u2019s reasonable to not trust him in your house. Should really consider a break from him until he\u2019s in recovery again so you are not triggered or pressured into a relapse.", "NTA in this specific situation, but why did you add \"I also want to add for context: I have expressed many times that I don\u2019t believe in moving in with a man unless I\u2019m engaged to him.\" That seems pretty hypocritical if he's spending 3 nights a week with you...", "NTA.
