Tell his sisters and Mom that they can be his alarm clock. \n\nI would reconsider this relationship and please NEVER have a child with him.", "You are NTA but you are incredibly patient.\n\nHe is not a child...you are not his carer; his family are rude...your husband enables them. \n\nUnless you find his tantrum amusing and his family's behaviour ignorable you really should should sit him down, look him in the eye, and tell him a few home truths including that choosing to get married comes with obligation to put your wife first.", "NTA just because you married into a toxic family doesn\u2019t mean you need to stay there.", "I don\u2019t know", "Info: He doesn't like sleeping next to electronics.  Does that include an alarm clock? \n\nDoes he manage to make it to work and other appointments each day? If so, he shouldn't have had an issue with this.", "So he had an important flight to catch and couldn't set his own alarm because he \"hates sleeping near to electronics\"? How does he get himself up in time for work every day? NTA, if it was actually important to him he should have put up with setting an alarm on his phone or otherwise figuring something out.", "NTA\nBut you are very silly to have married a spoiled boy who thinks hia mammy is always right. Time to make your escape plan,  his family will only be happy when his wife is hia slave and if you don't want to be that thia relationship will never be happy.", "NTA his entire family needs to grow up", "NTA for this situation, but you'll be one to yourself if you continue to allow him to be emotionally abusive towards you and allow his family to do the same. You need to admit to yourself what's going on here. You KNOW this is not acceptable behaviour.", "Girl, these dynamics are not gonna change.", "ESH. Him because he\u2019s an asshole\u2026 you, because you are allowing him to be an asshole.\n\nDon\u2019t let him treat you this way\u2026 unless you want to be his mom?", "Wow, dump him.", "NTA - You're not his mommy and he's not a child (in theory)\n\nHe needs to grow up.", "NTA. Break up with this walking red flag bag of red flag in a trenchcoat.", "NTA. I'm surprised you could stop laughing at their audacity long enough to type this, I would laugh forever.", "NTA\n\nThis is in no way your responsibility and he should feel embarrassed", "NTS. You are his wife not his mother. He can put his big boy pants on and learn to adult. I hope that you aren't planning on having any children with him because you already have a child.", "Nah. NTA. Fuck this guy.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult he can figure out how an alarm clock works.", "Drop this boy and find you a man. As a woman who has children with a man like that, I can\u2019t tell you he will never change. My bd doesn\u2019t even call his kids and his mommy pays his bills.

Realize now that he won't change, and he'll never stand up to his mom over you.  \n\nWhy are you with him?", "NTA but I recommend couples counselling and some serious heart to heart chats with your husband. He clearly must have some redeeming qualities or you wouldn't have married him and I don't think you're reached the point where the sunk cost fallacy kicks in. He's clearly the golden child in his family but that's no way to behave if he wants to continue having a serious relationship with you.", "I have to say that it is your fault. It is yours for allowing him and his family to treat you like a second-class citizen. You are still young and you should ask yourself if this is how it will be for the rest of your life.", "NTA\n\nTell his mother and sisters that if they didn\u2019t coddle him and stunt his ability to mature to a functional adult who didn\u2019t need a mommy to do basic things like wake him up, then he wouldn\u2019t have missed his flight.", "NTA.", "Nice, so your SO lets his family talk down to you and treat you like shit? Then he blames you for his own fuck ups and starts yelling?\n\nINFO: So why are you with this garbage person then?", "If he asked you to wake him up and you agreed to do it, then ESH (sorry)", "NTA. He and his entire family seem really toxic, best of luck.", "NTA. Your husband needs to stop being coddled. He has no right to be angry with you. Why are you with him? He\u2019s a momma\u2019s boy.", "If you told him you would wake him up, I can understand his confusion. You should have told him the evening when he asked that you will wake him up if you are already awake, but he should set alarms in case you don't wake up.\n\nIt is still his responsibility. Anyone with a good head on their shoulders would set multiple alarms to ensure making an important flight!", "His mom and sisters are pissed claiming I did this to get back at them and to isolate him- I would say  to MIL -So what you\u2019re saying is you admit to being a crappy mother who raised a man who is to stupid to know how to set an alarm and get up on time himself?   \n I\u2019d tell DH - please get a group together of your boss and coworkers  and let me tell them this  and let them decide if a 28 yr old man should be responsible forgetting himself up on time - some children over the age of 10 know how to do, or if I should baby you like a 2 year old and wake you up you want and your mother wants me to do. - if he gets mad at this then he knows he\u2019d be embarrassed if they know he wanted to be treated like an incompetent baby. You are NTA. DH & His mother/sister are huge AHs", " NTA. You are you choosing to be a single mom?", "NTA DTMFA", "YTA because you wrote that he asked you to wake him up for his flight. You did not write whether you told him no but it seems like he thought you would do it and you decided to be petty and sleep in. I would have said you were not the AH if he only expected you to wake him but that\u2019s not what you wrote. If he asked you to wake him up and went to sleep believing that you would then choosing not to wake him is an AH move.", "INFO: Did you tell him you'd wake him up?", "NTA. You were supposed to set some sort of alarm to wake yourself up so you could wake him up? Wtf? Even without the added issue of being uninvited to the event in question, that\u2019s just insane.", "NTA\n\nHis event, his responsibility to get there. It's his mother's fault for how she raised him. \n\nSounds like a bonus for you, not having to see his family. They sound like the kind of people worth avoiding.", "Why are you with him?\n\nFrom the way you talk about him, it doesn't seem you like him very much.", "NTA. You aren't responsible for holding his hand and guiding him through life, he is almost 30 and he can afford an alarm clock (even an analog one).", "INFO you said he asked you to wake him up, did you agree to do so? \n\nFor the record, I agree with everyone saying he is acting childish and its his own responsibility, and tbh this doesn\u2019t sound like a worthwhile relationship for you if you are having to act as his mother. However, whether or not you agreed beforehand does affect my judgement", "NTA. He is an adult and can wake himself up. You aren't his mommy, he isn't a child- that's not your responsibility.", "Based on the current information available in the post - NTA  \n\n\nThe only way you'd be the ahole would be if you'd promised him to wake him up\n\n  \nSounds to me like he could have set his own alarm and put his phone in a location that's a bit further away but within \"hearing the alarm and waking up\" range, if having the phone on the nightstand is an issue.  \nOr, if he really needed the help, he could have explicitly asked you to set the alarm the night before...", "NTA\n\nYou didn't set your alarm because it is not your responsibility \n\nHe is letting his family openly disrespect you and wants you to do the legwork to let them now. General rule is if your spouse is not invited to a wedding, it is disrespectful towards your spouse to go yourself, as an fyi, so strike one for even accepting the invitation \n\nStrike 2 for not setting an alarm as a grown adult\n\nStrike 3 for getting angry at you for not taking over his responsibilities in a situation he should not have even entered in because a supportive husband would have simply declined the invite without comment \n\nI would tell him if he wants a woman to be a mommy for him that he needs to move back in with his mother.\n\nIf you, for some reason, stay with this child, absolutely do not spend the holidays with his family. Do not go where you are not wanted, and have clearly been told you are not wanted, and do not make yourself miserable for someone who will not stick up for you.

I need to advocate for myself more!", "Especially since the reason she didn\u2019t need to get up was because she wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding. NTA", "She wishes the best for him. The best for him is that he grows up and takes responsibility for his own actions.\n\nShe's only Y T A because she 1) married such a mama's boy and 2) admittedly has been mothering him too", "He could have and should have set an alarm. Why is it up to her to wake up early just to get him up. He\u2019s a grown man who can do things himself. OP is NTA", "NTA. She shouldn't have to set an alarm to wake up just to wake up her husband. He is a grown man and not a school boy who gets woken up every day by his mommy.  \nOP is his wife, not his mother.

It might be a good idea to send this guy, who is your significant other, back to his mom and sisters and search for a more suitable partner.", "This! You know why he didn\u2019t wake up? Bc his entire life he\u2019s so safe and snuggly in his cocoon of boy-entitlement that it never even occurred to him to set an alarm. Bc at home\u2026 mommy and sisters would OBVIOUSLY wake themselves up just to gently arouse him from his well-deserved slumber for HIS early flight. I\u2019m amazed at stories like this where the family feels the need to get so involved in every little thing. NTA OP. Ps- run. Now.", "One has to wonder how the heck this guy gets to work in time every day.", "Love this.", "I laughed too", "I dunno. I kind of feel like he expected her to wake him up because his family always has and she's sort of had to for most instances. But if it involves her getting up early, the SMART thing to do would be to double check instead of, what I think is just assuming she'd 'do what she was supposed to do' because he's just a babby who needs his mommy. This whole situation gives me massive ick.", "I totally agree. He should be in charge of getting himself up. If you are usually the one to wake him up or agreed to do it this time and chose not to do it, that would be an asshole move.", "Was just thinking this.", "Sadly I feel like I have been acting as his Mom most of our marriage and hes now grown accustomed.", "You need to advocate your way to marriage counseling and then a divorce attorney when that fails.", "For real.
