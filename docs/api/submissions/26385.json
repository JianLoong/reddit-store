From your comments, it seems you are having problems coping, which is completely understandable. Definitely consider grief counseling and journaling. The book \"Tiger Eyes\" is relatable. \n\n Unfortunately, you do have traits of high risk teens: growing up in a single-parent household, not growing up with your dad, losing parent as a teenager, staying in a group home, poor, surly attitude, etc. If I believed in getting with men with kids, I would be on your ass too. You will thank her later. \n\nIn addition, calling people our publicly as the first option is always an AH move. If you tried talking to her and she continued to do it, that is one thing. However, you were just messy with it. \n\nStepmother is an AH for prejudging  your area. Seems she has some racial biases to unlearn. Definitely feel like a conversation with her is needed on these issues. Good luck, OP.", "Y T A \n\nFIRST thing you said was you've had a bad year, setting an excuse for your actions.\n\nThere's no sense of appreciation that your bio dad took you in - @ 16, with no relationship would make for a VERY difficult situation for all involved.\n\nSounds like you had a predisposition to not like or get along with Cheryl because she's the de facto mother figure now (which I'm sure she's not happy to be either)\n\nAs for the AITA situation you mentioned, Cheryl's comment was neither positive nor negative.  You chose to escalate it.\n\nYou should be more thankful your BIO dad took you in - some/half/many would not.\n\nRather than being mad @ your situation, you should try harder to make it work - your dad did by taking you in.", "NTA", "OP, you are NTA.

I can imagine that it's hard for step mom to suddenly find herself responsible for her husband's teenage daughter. (Doesn't give her the right to be an a**hole.) Bio dad is new at this. And the half siblings lives have been changed as well. I'm guessing they could use some help processing this, and it sound like stepmom or bio dad are not super mature, so they don't strike me as great candidates to hear and help the littles. And, of course, OP, has had trauma on top of trauma. Some structured guidance on what expect from each other and is and is not ok behavior would be really helpful. \n\nOP, even if the family therapy doesn't happen, please reach out to a trusted adult at school about some counseling for yourself.

It's his (adult) (parental) responsibility to make sure you're safe and welcome, not yours to notify him when you feel you aren't. \n\n(A last note -- OP, I hope your bio dad has arranged counseling for you. When I lost someone important and my life went sideways, I convinced everyone, including myself, that I'd Move Past It and Get Things Done.
