You are NTA but you uncovered her bias in such a clever way that she outted herself as TA...in front of everyone! You just kept feeding her rope as she professionally hung herself, lol!!\n\nExcellent job!", "NTA, Cheryl has the mindset of that rich rude person. And don't feel bad for talking back, cause I would've done worse, especially after my mum dying, sorry for your loss.", "NTA - *Cheryl was mad because I embarrassed her in front of her mom and \u201cimplied things\u201d*\n\nIsn't that exactly what Cheryl was doing to you?  She's upset because she got called out on her prejudice BS.  It does sound like your dad is trying his best with this new scenario but also that he is supportive.  Keep the lines of communication with him open and see where it goes.", "NTA. This is a tough situation and everyone is adapting. Your stepmother brought the embarrassment to herself with her attitude; it sounds like your pushback worked, it's engaging the people to help her see reason.\n\nI hope your father gets better at having your back here and I hope your stepmother starts treating you better.", "NTA in any way. In fact, awesome to redirect her comments back at her. Cheryl needs lessons in manners and being around children/young adults.", "NTA\n\nYou did not pick a fight. You called Cheryl out. She didn't like being held accountable for her jealous and immature attempt to tear down her own step child. She played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.\n\nI'm sorry that you have endured all that you have. No child, regardless of age, should have to deal with grief over a parent and upheaval. You are strong. You have a good sense of self respect. You are someone your mom can be proud of.", "You aren\u2019t the asshole. Cheryl is a grownup and she knows when she\u2019s picking a fight.", "NTA\n\nCheryl didn't listen to your dad, so shaming her in front of her mum was the best thing to do. She has some preconceived notions about your upbringing that need to be neutralised straightaway if you are to live there in peace. \n\nStay vocal, I'm proud of you. And I think you may have a new cool Nana.", "NTA\n\nYou tried talking to your bio dad and that didn't help the situation.  What else could you really do?  Plus, you asked important questions - why was she prejudiced against you?  Sounds like she has her own preconceived notions/biases that she projected onto you, a kid who just lost their mom and was forced to move in.", "NTA, you called her out. Clearly talking to your dad has done jack about it, maybe this will. She knows her line of thinking is wrong which is why she got embarrassed.", "NTA and your dad sounds like he kinda has your back which is almost unexpected in your situation, props to him. sorry for your loss", "nta\n\nso glad you got her to examine her own words - if she's embarassed, it's because of what she herself said", "NTA\nThat's on her. You responded as anyone would being treated like a criminal without cause. She must have been told you misbehaved or something? Unclear, but it seems silly for her to treat you like that without a reason.", "Nta at all and I'm sorry for your loss and for this continued crap", "NTA\n\nThere is a difference between picking a fight and calling someone out when they're being rude.  A huge difference.  I'm glad you stood up  to her in front of her family.  Hopefully having that mirror held up to her face will cause her to rethink her behavior.", "NTA - Sounds like she\u2019s made judgements and assumptions about your life without even attempting to get to know you or your life prior to living with them.", "NTA\n\nI am so sorry your mum died OP.\n\nThe last thing you need is a wicked step mother.", "NTA\n\nKill Cheryl with kindness. Befriend her mom. Keep your dad updated about how she talks to you. record her and show your dad. bite your tongue. secure the bag. start talking about college. this is your chance to write your ticket.", "NTA", "NTA. And you did go to your dad first and she started doing it when he wasn\u2019t around. Watch out for this one. Sounds like she doesn\u2019t want you there and will be hard on you.", "NTA  Cheryl messed around and found out.  If he mom asked YOU how school was going, Cheryl should have kept her yap shut.  She didn't and she got consequences.", "nta. she embarrassed herself", "NTA.  Good for you!  You discovered a way to call out Cheryl's ridiculous assumptions in front of someone who has some clout with her.", "NTA, if they decided to take you in they have to treat you as part of the family. Not doing crap like this", "NTA. Every time she forgets to stay in her lane fell free to shove her back in it. You handled it perfectly.", "NTA you just want to know why she's treating you like a criminal when you have done literally nothing wrong. Bio father wanted you to talk to him first? You did, and his efforts have done nothing. Are you supposed to just keep letting her nitpick you and take the abuse?", "OP. I was your age when my mother passed. As for your dad's wife, she now understands FAFO. NTA. Mom would be in her nineties now and miss her everyday. Just do the best you can for the next couple of years and get out. It's not an ideal situation for any of you. Best of luck OP!", "NTA. It sounds like you are handling things really well to me. It didn't seem like picking a fight to me, just asking for clarification. Man, I'm really sorry about your Mom, by the way. It does sound like your Dad is really trying and Cheryl's family is nice. I even think Cheryl will come around in the end. Right now, I'm sure she is fighting her own insecurities and just not handling them very well.", "Except, you did talk to him. It's not your fault that she just got subtle about her nastiness.\n\nNTA", "You got 2 more years..  hold tight & start looking into scholarships for college..  NTA", "NTA You did talk to your bio dad about the problems you were having. He didn't successfully deal with the issue. Your step mom repeated her poor behavior in front of her mother and you confronted her in a rather more polite way than I might have. If she was embarrassed, it's her own fault for treating you like that.", "NTA.\n\nYou did talk to him, she\u2019s still implying that you\u2019re a criminal and don\u2019t know how to behave in civilized society. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t yell and just asked clarifying questions, her embarrassment for being a jerk is all on her. \n\nGood luck.", "You've tried to reach out to Dad, but he brushed you off - Cheryl just turned into a sneak with her bad behavior - which she knows is bad behavior or she would do it in front of your Dad!\n\nNTA\n\nYou should send this link to your Dad so he is more aware of what you are regularly putting up with. I don't know if parenting classes, therapy, or what is called for, but there needs to be some sort of buffer for this ongoing attempt to make you feel unsupported and unwelcome.", "You are such TA.

You didn\u2019t embarrass her, she brought it on herself. You simply asked her what she meant by all those comments she made to you.
