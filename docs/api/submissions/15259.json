It was treatable, and she's fine now, but I was her caretaker, and at the time i was 10 years older than you are now. \n\nI remember one day I just got so frustrated. I was so burnt out. Exhausted from managing everything working and going to school. \n\nAnd every time someone called it was to check-in on her and one day I lost it and said can't a single person ask how I'm doing\n\nI just wanted to be seen for one minute for someone to say are you okay how are you handling. I felt selfish for that thought then and still kind of do now even though it's long since passed \n\nBut I know it was because I was trying to hold it together knowing the person I loved was falling apart. And instead of feeling like a member of the family I felt like a rent-a-nurse outsider there for vitals and other people's emotional support \n\nI don't think your jealous. I just think your struggling to navigate.\n\nYou did the right thing by speaking up. I'm sorry they reacted the way they did", "NTA - It's okay for you to hold two truths at once, you're very sad/scared that your brother has cancer, your very sad that everyone forgot your milestone birthday and are excluding you from the family events.\n\nUsually I'd not say anything bad about a mother dealing with her child having cancer but her reaction to you was the only \"disgusting\" that I read here today.", "NTA. I volunteer with an organization that serves medically vulnerable children, and one of our services is literally giving time and attention to siblings of sick kids. You\u2019re allowed to feel hurt and left out, especially since you\u2019ve mentioned you hang out with your brother\u2014it\u2019s not like you\u2019re bitterly ignoring him. Your family can pour their love and support and energy in your brother without neglecting your feelings. Stay strong!", "NTA.  You would be if you were actually jealous of your brother with cancer, but I don't think that's what it is.  I think you're feeling forgotten and neglected.  It's normal for your family to be giving so much time and attention to him, because that time now has a definite limit.  From what you've said, though, you don't have a problem with all of the time and attention he's getting, you just have a problem with the fact that you no longer get any.  It's normal and understandable that you would feel like you don't matter anymore if you are ignored or overlooked in their effort to spend as much time as they can with your brother, even if that's not their intention.  I'm sorry that your mom dismissed you and made you feel bad about it when you reached out to her, rather than having a conversation about it and trying to see your point of view.", "NTA. From what you say, all their attention is focused on him and they don't realize how out in the cold they've left you, even after you've tried to talk to them about it. \n\nYour feelings are not \"disgusting\", you are feeling like you're losing your parents on top of the tremendous pain of losing your brother soon.  I hope there is a way you can make them see what they're doing, that you need them too. You all need each other right now.\n\nI'm really sorry you're going through this but you are definitely NTA here.", "Ah so your mom definitely didn't hear what you were actually trying to say.\n\nIt makes total sense to feel hurt and left out of the family - obviously your parents are going through anticipatory grief and you acknowledge yourself that they're going to attend to your brother more. But that doesn't mean it's ok to completely skip over your bday or not invite you to movie night.\n\nMy mom has stage 4 cancer, so I definitely hear you and know where you're coming from. I can't say I felt the same way, but I empathize. \n\nYour mom calling you disgusting was too much. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for how your family is treating you. I had cancer when I was younger and my sister, who was 17 at the time, felt the same way as you. And she was correct, my family did treat her differently while I was sick. It sucks because you\u2019re suffering, too. Cancer affects the whole family, not just the person suffering from it. Cancer is terrifying and it\u2019s awful to see someone you love afflicted. \n\nYou aren\u2019t a terrible person and you aren\u2019t wrong for feeling this way. Your parents probably figure you don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d them as much as your brother needs them\u2026that\u2019s how my parents felt.

It's very sad that your brother is sick, but you don't stop existing because he has cancer. I understand your parents desire to spend as much time with him as possible and to focus on him and how he's feeling, but if they push you away while doing so, they will regret it. I know this because my mom did this to her children when my dad was dying of cancer and it took a long time for her to repair things with my younger brother and sister after he passed. It's easy to get tunnel vision in these situations, but they can't just press pause on the other people they love during his illness. You are still their child, and you still need them too. You are **NOT** selfish, and you are **NOT** disgusting and you are NTA here.", "NTA.  It is understandable that he is getting more of their attention, but if they can't even acknowledge your birthday that is too far gone.", "NTA.\n\nIt is 100% ok for you to feel neglected because everyone focuses so much on your bro.

Is this a cancer that was picked up some time ago and has got worse over the years ? Or is it more recent than that ?", "INFO: how long has it been since he was diagnosed and was his diagnosis revealed on/near your birthday or something? I am failing to understand why all your family would suddenly be asking him if he was okay on your birthday unless it was a fresh diagnosis.", "Nta, just because someone else is dying it doesnt mean you should be emotionally neglected. All they will achieve is make you be resentfull. So sorry your family isnt present for you", "There should be groups for teenagers that are dealing with cancer in a loved one. I would seek that out. These are valid feelings but if it\u2019s a terminal diagnosis your parents are blinded by the fear that any moment he could be gone. It\u2019s not right to treat you like that but that fear of a child dying can be paralyzing.", "At first, I thought for sure you were going to be the AH here but definitely not! \n\nYour family didn't even wish you a happy birthday. I would be upset about that too. It doesn't even have to do with your brother or his cancer, it has to do with the rest of your family not making you feel important and you expressing that to your mom is valid. \n\nShe sounds toxic and gaslighty asf. I'm sorry. \n\nAlso, happy birthday.", "NTA for wanting to be treated like their daughter.", "NTA and happy birthday", "You are in a hard spot. Being ignored sucks. Everyone wants attention, everyone wants to hear a happy birthday and have people do the stuff they want. Your family could handle this better, but at the same time, all the time they're ever going to have with your brother is happening now. And given it's terminal, there are no second chances.\n\nI don't think there is a way to address the hurt with your parents just yet. It's sad to say, but maybe the best outcome is counseling for yourself now and family counseling later.\n\nThis is somewhere between everyone sucks and no one sucks because there's good reasons for the feelings all around, but everyone is also not the greatest.", "Don't know if AH is the right word. You are still basically a kid who's family is going through tragedy. Be kind and patient with each other.", "It\u2019s a tough situation. It is understandable that you feel neglected in this situation that is unfair for all parties involved. You are in a position where you can exert your independence. You are at an age of getting ready for college. Let them soak up what memories they can make with your brother as you spread your wings. Since they neglected to say it to you HAPPY BIRTHDAY!", "NTA, your family is neglecting you, and when you point it out, they call you disgusting.  That's way over the top. Everyone is stressed and coping with death, but that doesn't mean ignore everything else.", "NTA! You are still a member of your family and deserve to be treated as such!", "NAH this is one of the many reasons cancer sucks. If possible I would see if you can get into therapy, the fact that you can name that you feel jealous is important and good and that could likely turn to guilt when he passes. Best to get ahead of it, and as many said it will be hard to get them to change if I was in their shoes I'd likely be trying to spend as much time as possible with him as well, even if it is not the right thing to do. They feel that you can wait since they have you for the rest of their kives which isn't fair or right.", "I don't think calling you an asshole will help but I think getting some therapy would be a great idea. I don't think it's wrong for your parents to prioritize time with your sibling when their time is limited. You should probably do the same, you will have your parents all to yourself in time and you might regret in the future wasting what time you have being jealous.", "I don\u2019t think this is an asshole situation. I\u2019m sorry no one said anything to you on your birthday, and I\u2019m sorry that your brother is dying. Why don\u2019t you try to spend some one on one time with your brother? Just the two of you chilling without your parents", "NTA. they don\u2019t invite you to watch movies together as a family and couldn\u2019t even wish you a happy birthday text? you\u2019re not really asking for much. \n\nconfessing to your mom should have been an opportunity for her to realize the effect this is having on you too. you\u2019re ALSO losing someone, and you\u2019re the least equipped to deal with this emotionally. she should have taken that chance to have an open dialogue about everything to connect with you, because it\u2019s also understand ku been hard on her. instead she chastises you. that\u2019s not ok. her child being \u2018jealous\u2019 of a terminal cancer patient says so much about her parenting skills.", "NAH \n\nThis may be an unpopular opinion, cause I put a lot of people will say NTA. \n\nYou have no idea what it\u2019s like to be a parent in the thought of having a child with a terminal diagnosis is absolutely unbearable. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re 12 or some thing, you\u2019re a full-fledged adult now. Your parents are trying to focus on your brother for whatever limited time he has on earth. \n\nLook for ways to support your brother and be involved. Honestly, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect your parents to have equal treatment. \n\nSomeday, if you have children, you\u2019ll look back on this and realize it\u2019s the worst possible thing that could ever happen to a human being with your parents are going through right now.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what your parents are doing is OK, it\u2019s not OK. But cancer is not a rational experience. Losing a child is easily life event that will make anybody go crazy. \n\nAnd honestly, well, I\u2019m not expecting you to be an expert linguist. I think there was probably a better way to address this with your family, then using a catchphrase.  \n\nHere\u2019s an example :\n\nI love brother, I know everyone\u2019s really upset, but it hurt my feelings that no one at least wished me a happy birthday.  I don\u2019t expect to get the same amount of attention is him as he\u2019s going through a terminal cancer diagnosis but it did make me feel like he\u2019s the only thing you think about I would appreciate it if I was included in family activities sometimes too.", "NTA - you are not jealous of your brother's illness. You are a neglected child. I understand your parents feel like spending extra time with their terminally ill child, but you should feel just as loved and important. It sounds like they are completely ignoring you, which is horrible. \n\nYou talked to your mom about your feelings, which was good. Sadly, she used that conversation to downgrade your feelings and emotions and make you feel worse for having them. Shame on her.", "NAH\n\nWhen I first read this, I thought you were being insensitive or maybe in denial about the cancer. \n\nBut this has been going on since 2021.  \n\nI can understand why you are hurt. And why it hurts to be forgotten. To be set aside like something that can just be picked up later.  You are not an asshole because that hurts you. \n\nPeople have a tendency to assume that we know how long someone has on this Earth. Your brother has a cancer diagnosis but doesn't mean he will for sure die first. \n\n\nI don't think your parents are assholes either. Just not realizing they shouldn't take your life for granted.", "NTA. Your parents are going to lose both children if they keep neglecting you.", "NAH. Just because he's dying doesn't mean you no longer need attention and care.

I suspect this will seem much less important then.", "NAH", "I don't think calling you an AH will help at all.  All I can say is you are going to miss him when he's gone.  Do you really want this to be what you remember?  Being angry about him getting attention?  I don't think so.  I'm willing to bet you're a good person, and you're frustrated and maybe even terrified of losing him.  You have every right to want attention from your parents.  And I can't imagine how that whole situation must be for you.  I stress the losing him part though.  You can't ever get this time back.  Don't spend it in anger.", "Depends on your relationship with family after your brother passes. If it\u2019s TERMINAL cancer, your brother obviously won\u2019t be expected to be around you and your family for many decades to come. You expectedly will be. If he has a virtual guaranteed death prognosis then it\u2019s understandable why the entire family is focusing on him rn and overwhelmed.", "NTA - but\u2026 you\u2019re 18.

It would be great for you to have a safe place to process ALL of your feelings. Wishing you and your family peace and comfort during this sad and awful time.", "NAH maybe your mom. Having a sick kid sucks. Having a sick brother sucks. Being so completely ignored you couldn\u2019t get a Happy Birthday let alone a cake \ud83c\udf82 and party hats \ud83e\udd73 really sucks! \n\nYour mom\u2019s reaction sucks.

Sorry for this tough time your family is going through.", "NAH\n\nYou are young, it's hard to understand how devastating this must be for your parents\n\nAnd it's normal to want to be seen as an individual\n\nYou just need to realize that others are not in that mode and can't just shake off their feelings.", "NTA. Your mom called you jealous, which is not the right word at all. You have emotional needs that aren't being met which is, tragically, very common in siblings of sick kids. Unfortunately there's no easy fix for this - I know it's extremely common for said siblings to go no contact with family after these kinds of issues.\n\nPlease keep in mind it's not personal. I'd definitely suggest trying to find some kind of therapy or support group in your area for this issue. The oncology unit your brother goes to probably has resources for you. Good luck.", "NTA. Unless your brother is going to pass imminently  your mother's response was awful.  I'm shocked your mother could not have at least had some minor apology for forgetting your birthday and given you a hug.  That's really all she needed to do and then get back to focusing on your brother.  \n\nAs a cancer survivor having a distraction like a sibling's bd would actually be a relief to not focus on being sick 24/7. \n\nOP, I'm so sorry for you and your family.

Sending so much love, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA. It's actually quite common when one sibling is sick that the healthy sibling feels neglected (often because they are). Grief counselors actually warn parents against isolating their healthy children as it breeds resentment.\n\nJust because you're brother is dying doesn't mean you don't deserve to be wished a happy birthday. Nor does it mean you deserve to be excluded. It sounds like they put you on the back burner when you were still a minor, and it's continued into your adulthood. That would be upsetting to a lot of people. While I understand that your mother is already grieving the loss of a child, that still doesn't mean how you've been treated is okay. You're not disgusting, and your feelings are not only valid but extremely common.\n\nAlso, I think people are completely missing that you are not actually jealous of the extra attention your brother is receiving but are more just asking not to be treated as an afterthought. It also sounds like you want to have memories as a family while he's still around, thus the desire to be included. All of this is reasonable.\n\nEdit: Also, Happy Birthday, OP.", "NTA. You can have more than one feeling. You can feel bad for your brother AND feel like your family is ignoring you. Because they are. I don't think you are jealous of your brother, but just left out. Is it possible to get family therapy? Your parents probably need someone to talk to too.", "NTA. The movie 16 candles is about a family forgetting their daughters 16th birthday because of their older daughters wedding. Not the same as cancer but it's definitely a theme.", "NTA\n\nI might be biased because I've been in a similar situation. Growing up, my older sibling was going through a lot of physical and mental health issues. As a result, a lot of the focus was on them and I often felt like I was left to my own devices. It's not a fun feeling. Your parents are suppose to be your people, they're suppose to look out for you and care for you. And when you get ignored, it really, really hurts. For me, it got to the point where I didn't even feel like I could go to them for help because it would only burden them when they had so much on their plate already and I should just handle it on my own. \n\nWhat really sucks about those situations is that you can't really blame others for wanting to give more attention to someone who is sick. Of course they do! And being terminally ill, I'm sure that makes every moment with your brother even more special. Still, it doesn't mean you have to be left out. You should be involved in these memories too, after. Why can't they just think of you more too? I mean, doesn't your brother want to spend time with you too? I'm sure he'd be grateful for more company. \n\nI'd try sitting down again with your parents. Make it clear you completely understand why they give him so much more attention. Youre upset too, you care about your brother too, you want to be there for him too. This isn't about jealousy, though, this is about neglect. It doesn't have to be either/or here, they can spend more time and care with your brother and still acknowledge and include you. You're also their child. \n\nI think it was wrong of your mom to call you disgusting for voicing your feelings. This is completely normal to feel this way especially when you are actively being left out of things.", "NTA. I've been in this exact situation. I turned 16 and we didn't have a birthday party, we had a \\*my sister's name\\* is cancer free for 1 month party. It's rough. As a younger sibling to someone with cancer, you inevitably end up on the back burner. It's important to communicate how you feel. Don't necessarily complain about what they're doing, because they are probably trying their best, but just communicate what YOU're going through. They aren't the only ones affected by your brother being sick, and if they don't try to keep you in their lives, they may end up losing 2 children...", "NTA! You aren't jealous of your brother, who are scared but you are also needing to be shown love and support as well. Talk to others in your family and just let them know how you feel.", "NTA, but clarify that you aren't jealous that he has cancer, but that he has ALL of EVERYONES attention. \n\nYou are still very young and it's absolutely fair to feel the way you do when being pushed to the back burner... But don't spend the last of your brothers time resenting him... Not saying you do I am just saying in case", "NTA. Mom is for taking out her feeling of being called-out over being focused exclusively on your brother and making an unfounded accusation.\n\nA person can believe two things at the same time--that it's objectively awful that her brother is going to die but also, simultaneously, that she doesn't want to become a non-person to her family. She needs her family, too, and it's okay to feel however you feel. Nobody really controls their feelings, they control their reactions to them.\n\nSo it's okay to feel this way, what's more important, is being aware of the fact that you feel both things at the same time and not taking it out on your brother.\n\nAll of this sucks a lot, and it's terrible you get to face this at such a young age.

I am curious why you aren't spending time with him.   You are 18 and old enough to be an adult about this.

I would like to add two things for OP: first, it's never \"wrong\" to feel a feeling. Feelings are just the way our body and mind react to the world around us. Second, a feeling of jealousy is a way to recognize that you've got a need that is being unmet. In this case, you need to know that you are seen by your family members.

So I think it is important for her to give them a break, and go the extra mile to include herself in the movies and activities that she hasn\u2019t been formally \u201cinvited\u201dto.

When I read these AITA posts, I know it is written from one side of the situation so I try to give the benefit of the doubt in many of these and as a parent o really sympathize with all the parties here. When I read how she approached and talked to them, did she sit down and try to have an open discussion or did she bring in up in a hostile manner? I have a teenager, there are many times when our conversations could go much more pleasant if we would have approached it differently.\n\nAlso I am not intending to guilt her.

It must be a thousand times worse to see your son, still a young man, who should be out there building his life, deteriorating in a bed in front of you and there's nothing you can do to help him. \n\nI think that your parents have been sheltering you from the worst of it and you haven't quite grasped how awful it is for them. Maybe you haven't really grasped the situation either because it's too horrible and you don't want to think deeply about it (I understand, I was the same age when my grandpa got diagnosed with cancer and I refused to really think about how bad the whole situation was for a long time). \n\nIn 5 years, when your brother is gone and you're an adult, you're not gonna think \"man, I wish my uncle wished me happy birthday on the group chat\", or \"man, I wish my mom had come to my room and asked me to watch a movie together with the rest of the family\". You're gonna wish you still had your brother. And you're gonna ask yourself \"why didn't I spend more time with him, why didn't I tell him I love him more, why didn't I hug him more, why didn't I ask him stuff\". And that's regardless of how much you actually do those things now. Even if you tell him you love him every single day in 5 years you're gonna wish you did it more often. \n\nYour parents understand this and they are trying to cram everything into these last few months. They won't get more time with your brother. Their time with him is limited and every second is one second closer to the terrible moment of his death and the constant pain that will come after.  They are terrified of wasting the precious time they have left with him. And because their time and energy is limited, that means they can't give you as much attention anymore. \n\nThat's hurtful, I understand, but think about the big picture. In a few months or however long he has, he won't be there anymore to be the center of attention. You'll be an only child. You'll have 100% of your parents' attention. Do you really want to poison the last weeks you and your parents have with your brother by allowing yourself to be hurt by their momentary lack of attention towards you? Aren't you much, much more upset by the fact that your brother is dying? \n\nThe pain due to the lack of attention, though justifiable, should be nothing compared to the prospect of losing your brother soon. I encourage you to put it aside and try to be there with (and for) your parents and your brother instead of waiting for them to make the first move. If they are watching a movie together, instead of staying in your bedroom and waiting for them to come call you, go and join them. I presume y'all live in the same house, they don't need to \"invite\" you. They probably think you'd rather be alone if you don't join them.\n\nIn a few months, again, you'll be an only child, all of their attention will be on you because they won't have anyone else to \"steal\" it. I really don't think you're gonna be happier then. Really, attention is not what you need at the moment. It's loving your brother, spending time with him, making sure he's as happy as he can be at the end of his life, helping your parents get through this terrible loss. You'll get plenty of attention when he's gone, but you won't get more time with him. Don't poison that precious time with bitterness towards your family\n\nI wish you the best of luck. I don't think you're an asshole. You're very young and what may seem important to you now will look silly and senseless in the future.", "Sadly you are the A hole. Your brother has limited time in this world and you want everything to be about you? Unless you are a parent who will see the death of their own child you cannot fathom the thought of what your parents are going through.\nTry to be supportive to your brother. Change your attitude and show him how much you love and care for him. Regret is far worse than what you are feeling now.", "NAH\n\nThis is incredibly common.  I knew a kid in highschool that was going through something similar (as far as I know his brother recovered) \n\nThe thing is. . . they're focused on your brother because they don't know how long he'll be around for, so it's a matter of knowing that his time is limited.  Now we could argue (effectively) that everyone's time is limited, but, it's far easier to tell oneself \"I have lots of time with them\" and in general it's true.\n\nIt's a shitty situation, but, well. . . I think making sure that everything is said and that your brother can leave this world takes a precedent over you for the time being.  I'm really sorry, but that is the way it tends to be in these situations.", "It likely was \"planned\" that they acknowledge your birthday without celebrating because you brother won't keep having new birthdays? I would have very quietly explained that though. And stop comparing yourself and the attention you get to someone who won't hear praises and affections in the grave.\n\nNAH.", "Oh honey. I'm so sorry. Your parents are focused on your brother because he's going to die and they will never have another chance to love him or spend time with him. But not including you is hurtful (I assume accidentally). \n\nI think your best bet here is to just talk to your parents. Don't tell them \"I'm jealous of brother\" - tell them \"I'm going to lose him too, and I need to feel like an important part of this family and this experience. Please include me more in your plans.\"\n\nYou can also take initiative and ask them all to do things together that your brother can handle.\n\nNAH, you are human, you have needs and feelings, everyone here is likely really trying, but it's hard to be your best in the midst of something like this.", "I'm gonna say NAH. This is just sort of what happens. My older brother passed away from cancer when I was 12 and he was 17, and I felt the same exact way you do now. Cast aside. I remember even getting into a huge blow out fight with my mom one night when I was feeling neglected and shouting \"it's not like he's going to die!\" And guess what... he did. That moment haunted me for years. And once he was gone, I carried that guilt about feeling \"jealous\" for a long time. But now looking back 15+ years later, I realize we were all just feeling very big, overwhelming emotions and doing the best we could with them. I have a lot more grace for my parents than I used to because there is truly nothing worse in this world than losing a child and watching them suffer. It's every parent's greatest fear. Our parents are still people and they are flawed and imperfect. You can't expect them to handle such a tremendously difficult situation perfectly without making any mistakes. And you are also not wrong for feeling the way you do, because they ARE making a mistake by neglecting you, it's just a very human mistake to make in their situation. The best thing you can do is be open and vulnerable about how you're feeling without being accusatory. As awful as it is to say, if your brother is terminal, I doubt they'd want to jeopardize/sacrifice their relationship with you and risk losing two children for the price of once.", "\n\nI doubt you're jealous. You're probably scared and lonely, nobody is there for you helping you cope with your brother being sick. You probably think nobody cares how you are. I am sure they do. But it sounds like they're already grieving and are losing touch. It might have felt like you were complaining when all you did Was telling them how you feel. \n\nHow is the relationship between your brother and you? Could you ask him to do something together? Maybe that way you could get \"in\" and not feel left out anymore.\n\nI wish you the best and a lot of strength. The coming months will be tough. Take care, stay safe! \ud83c\udf40\n\nEdit: changing my verdict to NAH", "Don't be jealous, give your bro all you can. If it is indeed terminal I think you need all the time you can. I promise you won't regret it.", "I understand how you feel but it\u2019s probably not going to get better.

You are behaving like a toddler. Grow up, the \u2018me, me, me\u2019 phase should be over. On a kinder note if you have any good feelings about your brother, when he passes, expect to be overwhelmed.

Everyone is going through a lot here, not just you. With that said, your mother was wrong to instantly demean you. She should know well that instead of instantly lashing out, she should have taken time to understand your point of view and she explain to you, her side. With that said, please try not to hold it against her for very long. Hurt people hurt people, she is falling apart on the inside. We're not perfect beings and we make mistakes, so while she was wrong, the context explains why she lashed out. I hope she apologizes eventually though. No parent should have to outlive their child and there is no guidelines on how to tread this situation. Please understand that your brother will come first during this tragic time.\n\nThat's all i have to say about that situation, so lastly, let me express my condolences to you and your family.", "My brother died from brain cancer, granted I\u2019m the older sibling and we were in our 30\u2019s when he was diagnosed so circumstances were a little different than yours. Myself and my parents helped out as much as we could with his care and I have to say I was never jealous of the extra attention he received in part because I knew it was for a finite amount of time, because as a parent myself I couldn\u2019t imagine what our parents were going through knowing their child would die before them, and because I had gone through treatment for breast cancer myself, which was mild compared to what he went through and it still sucked. \nHaving said that you\u2019re still very young and (I\u2019m not sure how to say this in a way that doesn\u2019t sound bad but I honestly don\u2019t mean it as a negative) your empathy is still developing, I can remember still being very \u201cme\u201d focused at your age. Your mother\u2019s response to your honesty wasn\u2019t good at all, but I imagine she is dealing with so much emotionally right now that maybe one more thing was too much to handle in the moment. Maybe you could try talking to her again when you can both sit down for a few minutes and explain that you feel left out, that you want to be a part of things? Maybe you could talk to a counselor? I don\u2019t have an easy answer for you, your feelings are valid, your parents focus on your brother is understandable and the harsh reality is that your brother isn\u2019t going to be around forever.

At school my teachers wouldn\u2019t ask me how my day was, but would instead ask how he was. It was exhausting that during this time, I never saw my parents and it felt like in return no one saw me.

You are someone who is strong, loveable, and amazing in your own way. You're perfect the way you are. You deserve to be loved.

You broke first.  I'm guessing your conversation with your mom wasn't a sit down over cookies and milk, but rather an expression of how angry and hurt you are.  If you can have that calm discussion, maybe you could explain to her how you feel \"both\" and that you really do understand about your brother, but that every now and then, you could use a little attention also.  Try giving your mom and dad a few compliments and extra hugs - you may get some in return.  And ask to be included in some family movie nights - they may feel they are protecting you by leaving you out.  I felt like my parents completely boxed me out when my brother died and I just stewed in my anger and moved further and further away from them.

Her 18th birthday might be the last family birthday her brother gets to participate in - and it was ignored. \n\nIt's totally understandable they are focused on their son and spending as much time as possible with him. But I'm a little confused at them seeming to leave out OP - the family won't feel \"whole\" without their son when he's gone, but it's not whole without OP, either. And she's just turned 18, when many people are on the verge of leaving the nest - are they going to exclude her to the point she pulls away, and they effectively lose both their children?

He knew it was only a matter of time before he couldn\u2019t keep it together in front of us and he didn\u2019t want us to see him break.  \n\nWhat I learned is we need to give our loved ones grace and compassion when in this situation as it is completely gut wrenching and I sincerely hope nobody reading this comment has to go through it.

If you *were* jealous, I would say a maybe, but if I understand you correctly, you just want your family to include you as well and acknowledge your existence. \n\nI agree with other commenters who say that this is a case of two truths at once. It really is. You are worried, grieved, and sad about your brother. You are also sad that it feels like your family doesn\u2019t care about you because all of their focus is on your brother. And it\u2019s not even as simple as that \u2014 you\u2019d just like to acknowledged. Your birthday should have been acknowledged, and celebrated. I bet your brother probably would have been happy to celebrate you and keep a little of the light off of himself for a minute. \n\nOften, parents don\u2019t know how to handle the loss of a child, especially one that is prolonged and known about in advance. They often fail at taking care of their other children when one has greater \u201cneeds\u201d. They are probably thinking that they can celebrate a lifetime of birthdays with you after your brother passes, but they want every second with him until he does. \n\nUnfortunately, parents are just humans, figuring it out as they go. Which means they don\u2019t always choose right, or what\u2019s best for their kids.\n\nSince they\u2019re treating you as an adult, approach your mom like one. Ask her to sit down with you and explain how it was very hurtful that she responded to by calling you jealous. Of course you aren\u2019t *jealous* of your brother. You were just hoping they\u2019d acknowledge your birthday. All of you are grieving, and it\u2019s a weird place to be in, grieving before the person is gone. You would like to grieve with them, and be included as part of the family. You love your brother just as much, even if in a different way. You, like your parents, expected a long life with him in it. It doesn\u2019t disrespect or disregard your brother and his situation to acknowledge your birthday. You still need your parents, too. \n\nAs someone who lost my older brother at your age, I can tell you it isn\u2019t easy. My parents were truly wrecked by losing their son. I was a mess after losing my brother and best friend. My oldest brother lost his best friend. We didn\u2019t always know how to support each other through it. We figured it out eventually.

But that saying that when someone dies/is dying everyone comes together is true and not true. Given the choice, I'd say not true. Because whatever dysfunction existed prior to illness and death gets magnified. Sometimes, people actually behave very badly to those left behind, including your mom toward you OP. I am so sorry that's happening for you.\n\nThere are probably some local grief resources where you are. I do some work for a grief center where I live and I have many friends who lost their loved ones. There's a kids/teens group where they can talk about these things and not be guilted. There are online resources available too. Some groups meet on Zoom or in writing. Specifically, there are resources for loved ones of people with cancer.\n\nYour parents' focus on your brother is understandable. But treating you so badly because you want their love and attention too, not as much. I think it's important for you to be supported, and since your parents aren't doing that, I would look for a support system somewhere else while you navigate through this.

By excluding you from the time they're spending with your brother they're inadvertently damaging a person they care for very much \n\nIf it were me I would be a little more aggressive I trying to schedule your own family activity. For example maybe ask if you all (brother, parents, you) can play cards or listen to music. Maybe they consider movie time 'their' time with your brother but might be open to something else as a family activity", "Exactly.  I think it's unfair to the mom to call her the asshole.  Is she in the wrong?  Yeah, probably.  But this is also a terrible situation that hopefully many commenters saying she's the asshole will never be in.  It's okay to feel left out, but understand that your mother is loosing a child, something no parent ever wants to go through.", "I think the original comment here is a little harsh, I don't necessarily think your family doesn't care about you, I definitely think they are neglecting you but I think it's because they don't know how to navigate the situation not necessarily because they don't care about you. That being said they absolutely need to take accountability for the way they have treated you because you absolutely deserve more time from them and for sure way more respect and I completely understand how all of this can be a huge hinderance on your mental health. Are you in currently in any type of therapy or is that something you would consider if you aren't? Maybe even some family therapy too could be beneficial I've had multiple family members who had cancer and we took care of them and we definitely could've benefited from some therapy/grief counseling", "Where in your original post does it say it\u2019s been going on for two years?\nI moved out at 18. Many people I know did. 18 is an adult. To be fair if it\u2019s been going on for 2 years then you clearly have a teenager mindset about it.\nIn which case my judgement might change however you need to include all relevant info in your main post.", "I'm glad you were able to reconnect with your siblings. Parents owe *all* their kids love and attention, even if it has to be equitable not equal, and it's horrible when they fail to recognize that.", "Or reaching out and figure out with others how to get those needs met! It doesn't mean that they have to take that thing or time away from others, maybe it just means that we need a little more of it, too.", "Yes well, brother is 26 and you're not supposed to die at that age. But it's OP who has it hard.", "I don't think most people need an invitation to their parents house, especially at that age.\n\nIt's possible they feel like she doesn't want to be around and has distanced herself. I know if my sibling had cancer I wouldn't be waiting on an invite from my parents to go over and see them. That seems more odd to me, but that's just the dynamic in my family, so who knows. Just playing devils advocate.", "No but they also didn\u2019t grown up being looked past because of their I\u2019ll sibling. They are an adult not a child. so calling themselves a glass child is dramatic", "Yeah, I typically feel that parents dealing with something like this deserve a lot of grace but her mom\u2019s response here was just vile. It also rubs me the wrong way that OP is being excluded from movie nights, etc. with her brother and her parents. I\u2019m going to assume that she still lives at home, which then makes it seem intentional as they\u2019d almost have to go out of their way to NOT include OP. \n \nHer parents aren\u2019t the only people losing someone they love here. OP is just reaching adulthood and is being forced to cope with the reality of losing her sibling entirely on her own. \n\nOP\u2019s parents are failing her and while I try not to judge people\u2019s character based on what little information we get in these posts, I can\u2019t help but feel like this isn\u2019t the first time OP\u2019s mom has treated her this poorly.", "Even a text it your busy \n- OP just wants them to acknowledge that she exists.\n\nI feel like something weird is going on here- like even if everything is revolving around her brother right now wouldn't it make sense if they expected OP to also participate in that?  It seems like they're actively making the choice to exclude OP- otherwise OP would be expected to participate in movie nights.", "it\u2019s great that you and other people that you know were able to financially and emotionally care for themselves at 18 but not everybody is able to do that", "Please kindly stop berating OP, and take a look at her post history. There is a lot of pain happening here, way above the pay grade of Reddit.", "OP, don't pay attention to him, these people don't understand the difference between being legally an adult and really being an adult, you have no experience and a short time ago you were a teenager and you still are, not because you are 18 magically you know everything about adult and understand how everything works, whether you are an adult or not, your parents should not ignore you and treat you like that, what happens is that in the United States they have the habit of sending their children to hell the same day you turn 18", "Yeah, be an asshole to a sui\u0441idal kid who feels left out and not supported by her parents when she needs them the most. Hope you're proud of yourself", "Yeah, the \"healthy\" sibling cuts off all contact when they become an adult, and only repairs a relationship with siblings (if they live) and never the parents. It is well known and documented that siblings of a sick sibling are often neglected.\n\nHer parents seem like they need therapy for their grief or else they're forever going to lose her. She has no familial support, I would not be surprised if once she's able to be independent she cuts them all off, and honestly, she should. \n\nI hadn't thought of an all-or-nothing situation. Grief is weird, it's not out of the realm of possibility, but it's most likely that they are so hyperfocused on their son that they think they can just abandon her and she'll still be there when brother dies, and she's just selfish for taking time away from them with their son. It'll come as a big shock when they lose both kids, and if they're really close-minded, they'll blame her for it and not themselves.", "If they've been pushing her away (unintentionally) since she was 17 (her brother was diagnosed almost 2 years ago, apparently) then I can see her feeling like she's \"intruding\" on them. She doesn't say if it's at her parents house either, they could be at her brother's place? Is she even told about the movie nights, or does she find out after? Lot of missing info.\n\nI think too often we get caught up on \"you don't need an explicit invitation to spend time with family\" but a lot of kids are being taught online that \"if you are not invited, they do not want you there\" and take it to heart not realizing that family may not know you think you an invite. I see it on TikTok/Twitter all the time, so I can see where OP got the idea.\n\nAnd I think even if they did have that relationship, OP is feeling so neglected now that she does not feel like she is welcome, and to me, the parents have a responsibility to check in with her. If I was her mom, I'd be like \"Honey, why don't you want to join us on family movie night?\" because I'd be upset my kid doesn't wanna go see her sick brother...but we don't know if anyone has done anything like that, maybe they have.", "That part was supposed to be a response to a different comment.. I wasn't thinking 100% when I had typed mine up and had two responses in one. I can definitely see that OP's parents aren't trying", "You suck and have zero sense of perspective.", "I'm sorry that you had to become a \"full grown adult\" at 18. It's not normal though. You're still a teenager and you're still growing at this age", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "> it's unfortunate that she's not going to be the focus for a long time and it's horrible but it's the truth.\n\nOP is not asking them to ignore her brother and throw her a parade like she's the queen of England. A quick \"oh happy birthday, sweetie\" could've sufficed. Perhaps a simple \"how are you holding up?\" for the girl who is going to lose her BROTHER. Don't forget at any point they could've also invited her to partake in family time as well since their time as a whole family is now limited, but they chose to not do so.\n\nThey're losing more than one child and it's pretty obvious they don't care.", "OP, I\u2019ve read your post history. Are you OK? Is there anyone in your life you can reach out to? A counsellor at school? A friend\u2019s parent? A teacher? You are worthy, hon. You are good. And there are lots of people here who are sending you all the love and support possible. Several people have posted support links. Please take a look at them. You are so very worth it.", "Don't listen to that person. They may have missed out on familial bonding themselves and expect you to just get over it like they did. Your feelings are valid. There are lots of internet strangers who care enough to read your post and respond to it, even when some comments are misguided and harsh. Hell, idk you, but I care.\n\nAlso, happy VERY belated 18th birthday. My mom was born in June. It's a good month \ud83d\ude0a", "It's a sad \" 16 candles \" situation, if you saw the movie.", "Bully for you. I think if you read OP\u2019s post history, you\u2019d realize that she\u2019s very dangerously hurting right now. Please try a little compassion and empathy here. In this case, it\u2019s incredibly important.", "I managed to sing happy birthday to my son while his then-infant sister was literally dying in the hospital bed next to me (she did survive, but we didn\u2019t know that was going to happen). Put on a big, happy smile because he was a three year old who had just watched his sister dying in our apartment a few days before and he deserved to be happy and enjoy his birthday. \n\nThe first thing we did once she was stable? Take him out to celebrate.\n\nThose parents are seriously messed up.", "You just implied that OP's grief is lesser than her parents' grief. No one wrongly inferred that. I lost my child. It's hell on earth. But it would never excuse being abusive toward my other child. OP's brother's impending death is being recognized by her parents. But OP's *LIFE* is not. Both are important."]}
