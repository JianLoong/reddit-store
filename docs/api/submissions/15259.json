It was treatable, and she's fine now, but I was her caretaker, and at the time i was 10 years older than you are now. \n\nI remember one day I just got so frustrated. I was so burnt out. Exhausted from managing everything working and going to school. \n\nAnd every time someone called it was to check-in on her and one day I lost it and said can't a single person ask how I'm doing\n\nI just wanted to be seen for one minute for someone to say are you okay how are you handling. I felt selfish for that thought then and still kind of do now even though it's long since passed \n\nBut I know it was because I was trying to hold it together knowing the person I loved was falling apart. And instead of feeling like a member of the family I felt like a rent-a-nurse outsider there for vitals and other people's emotional support \n\nI don't think your jealous. I just think your struggling to navigate.\n\nYou did the right thing by speaking up. I'm sorry they reacted the way they did", "NTA - It's okay for you to hold two truths at once, you're very sad/scared that your brother hand cancer, your very sad that everyone forgot your milestone birthday and are excluding you from the family events.  \n\nUsually I'd not say anything bad about a mother dealing with her child having cancer but her reaction to you was the only \"disgusting\" that I read here today.", "NTA. I volunteer with an organization that serves medically vulnerable children, and one of our services is literally giving time and attention to siblings of sick kids. You\u2019re allowed to feel hurt and left out, especially since you\u2019ve mentioned you hang out with your brother\u2014it\u2019s not like you\u2019re bitterly ignoring him. Your family can pour their love and support and energy in your brother without neglecting your feelings. Stay strong!", "NTA.  YWBTA if you were actually jealous of your brother with cancer, but I don't think that's what it is.  I think you're feeling forgotten and neglected.  It's normal for your family to be giving so much time and attention to him, because that time now has a definite limit.  From what you've said, though, you don't have a problem with all of the time and attention he's getting, you just have a problem with the fact that you no longer get any.  It's normal and understandable that you would feel like you don't matter anymore if you are ignored or overlooked in their effort to spend as much time as they can with your brother, even if that's not their intention.  I'm sorry that your mom dismissed you and made you feel bad about it when you reached out to her, rather than having a conversation about it and trying to see your point of view.", "NTA. From what you say, all their attention is focused on him and they don't realize how out in the cold they've left you, even after you've tried to talk to them about it. \n\nYour feelings are not \"disgusting\", you are feeling like you're losing your parents on top of the tremendous pain of losing your brother soon.  I hope there is a way you can make them see what they're doing, that you need them too. You all need each other right now.\n\nI'm really sorry you're going through this but you are definitely NTA here.", "Ah so your mom definitely didn't hear what you were actually trying to say.\n\nIt makes total sense to feel hurt and left out of the family - obviously your parents are going through anticipatory grief and you acknowledge yourself that they're going to attend to your brother more. But that doesn't mean it's ok to completely skip over your bday or not invite you to movie night.\n\nMy mom has stage 4 cancer, so I definitely hear you and know where you're coming from. I can't say I felt the same way, but I empathize. \n\nYour mom calling you disgusting was too much. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for how your family is treating you. I had cancer when I was younger and my sister, who was 17 at the time, felt the same way as you. And she was correct, my family did treat her differently while I was sick. It sucks because you\u2019re suffering, too. Cancer affects the whole family, not just the person suffering from it. Cancer is terrifying and it\u2019s awful to see someone you love afflicted. \n\nYou aren\u2019t a terrible person and you aren\u2019t wrong for feeling this way. Your parents probably figure you don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d them as much as your brother needs them\u2026that\u2019s how my parents felt.

It's very sad that your brother is sick, but you don't stop existing because he has cancer. I understand your parents desire to spend as much time with him as possible and to focus on him and how he's feeling, but if they push you away while doing so, they will regret it. I know this because my mom did this to her children when my dad was dying of cancer and it took a long time for her to repair things with my younger brother and sister after he passed. It's easy to get tunnel vision in these situations, but they can't just press pause on the other people they love during his illness. You are still their child, and you still need them too. You are **NOT** selfish, and you are **NOT** disgusting and you are NTA here.", "NTA.  It is understandable that he is getting more of their attention, but if they can't even acknowledge your birthday that is too far gone.", "NTA.\n\nIt is 100% ok for you to feel neglected because everyone focuses so much on your bro.

Is this a cancer that was picked up some time ago and has got worse over the years ? Or is it more recent than that ?", "INFO: how long has it been since he was diagnosed and was his diagnosis revealed on/near your birthday or something? I am failing to understand why all your family would suddenly be asking him if he was okay on your birthday unless it was a fresh diagnosis.", "Nta, just because someone else is dying it doesnt mean you should be emotionally neglected. All they will achieve is make you be resentfull. So sorry your family isnt present for you", "There should be groups for teenagers that are dealing with cancer in a loved one. I would seek that out. These are valid feelings but if it\u2019s a terminal diagnosis your parents are blinded by the fear that any moment he could be gone. It\u2019s not right to treat you like that but that fear of a child dying can be paralyzing.", "At first, I thought for sure you were going to be the AH here but definitely not! \n\nYour family didn't even wish you a happy birthday. I would be upset about that too. It doesn't even have to do with your brother or his cancer, it has to do with the rest of your family not making you feel important and you expressing that to your mom is valid. \n\nShe sounds toxic and gaslighty asf. I'm sorry. \n\nAlso, happy birthday.", "NTA for wanting to be treated like their daughter.", "NTA and happy birthday", "You are in a hard spot. Being ignored sucks. Everyone wants attention, everyone wants to hear a happy birthday and have people do the stuff they want. Your family could handle this better, but at the same time, all the time they're ever going to have with your brother is happening now. And given it's terminal, there are no second chances.\n\nI don't think there is a way to address the hurt with your parents just yet. It's sad to say, but maybe the best outcome is counseling for yourself now and family counseling later.\n\nThis is somewhere between everyone sucks and no one sucks because there's good reasons for the feelings all around, but everyone is also not the greatest.", "Don't know if AH is the right word. You are still basically a kid who's family is going through tragedy. Be kind and patient with each other.", "It\u2019s a tough situation. It is understandable that you feel neglected in this situation that is unfair for all parties involved. You are in a position where you can exert your independence. You are at an age of getting ready for college. Let them soak up what memories they can make with your brother as you spread your wings. Since they neglected to say it to you HAPPY BIRTHDAY!", "NTA, your family is neglecting you, and when you point it out, they call you disgusting.  That's way over the top. Everyone is stressed and coping with death, but that doesn't mean ignore everything else.", "NTA! You are still a member of your family and deserve to be treated as such!", "NAH this is one of the many reasons cancer sucks. If possible I would see if you can get into therapy, the fact that you can name that you feel jealous is important and good and that could likely turn to guilt when he passes. Best to get ahead of it, and as many said it will be hard to get them to change if I was in their shoes I'd likely be trying to spend as much time as possible with him as well, even if it is not the right thing to do. They feel that you can wait since they have you for the rest of their kives which isn't fair or right.", "I don't think calling you an asshole will help but I think getting some therapy would be a great idea. I don't think it's wrong for your parents to prioritize time with your sibling when their time is limited. You should probably do the same, you will have your parents all to yourself in time and you might regret in the future wasting what time you have being jealous.", "I don\u2019t think this is an asshole situation. I\u2019m sorry no one said anything to you on your birthday, and I\u2019m sorry that your brother is dying. Why don\u2019t you try to spend some one on one time with your brother? Just the two of you chilling without your parents", "NTA. they don\u2019t invite you to watch movies together as a family and couldn\u2019t even wish you a happy birthday text? you\u2019re not really asking for much. \n\nconfessing to your mom should have been an opportunity for her to realize the effect this is having on you too. you\u2019re ALSO losing someone, and you\u2019re the least equipped to deal with this emotionally. she should have taken that chance to have an open dialogue about everything to connect with you, because it\u2019s also understand ku been hard on her. instead she chastises you. that\u2019s not ok. her child being \u2018jealous\u2019 of a terminal cancer patient says so much about her parenting skills.", "NAH \n\nThis may be an unpopular opinion, cause I put a lot of people will say NTA. \n\nYou have no idea what it\u2019s like to be a parent in the thought of having a child with a terminal diagnosis is absolutely unbearable. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re 12 or some thing, you\u2019re a full-fledged adult now. Your parents are trying to focus on your brother for whatever limited time he has on earth. \n\nLook for ways to support your brother and be involved. Honestly, it\u2019s unrealistic to expect your parents to have equal treatment. \n\nSomeday, if you have children, you\u2019ll look back on this and realize it\u2019s the worst possible thing that could ever happen to a human being with your parents are going through right now.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what your parents are doing is OK, it\u2019s not OK. But cancer is not a rational experience. Losing a child is easily life event that will make anybody go crazy. \n\nAnd honestly, well, I\u2019m not expecting you to be an expert linguist. I think there was probably a better way to address this with your family, then using a catchphrase.  \n\nHere\u2019s an example :\n\nI love brother, I know everyone\u2019s really upset, but it hurt my feelings that no one at least wished me a happy birthday.  I don\u2019t expect to get the same amount of attention is him as he\u2019s going through a terminal cancer diagnosis but it did make me feel like he\u2019s the only thing you think about I would appreciate it if I was included in family activities sometimes too.", "NTA - you are not jealous of your brother's illness. You are a neglected child. I understand your parents feel like spending extra time with their terminally ill child, but you should feel just as loved and important. It sounds like they are completely ignoring you, which is horrible. \n\nYou talked to your mom about your feelings, which was good. Sadly, she used that conversation to downgrade your feelings and emotions and make you feel worse for having them. Shame on her.", "NAH\n\nWhen I first read this, I thought you were being insensitive or maybe in denial about the cancer. \n\nBut this has been going on since 2021.  \n\nI can understand why you are hurt. And why it hurts to be forgotten. To be set aside like something that can just be picked up later.  You are not an asshole because that hurts you. \n\nPeople have a tendency to assume that we know how long someone has on this Earth. Your brother has a cancer diagnosis but doesn't mean he will for sure die first. \n\n\nI don't think your parents are assholes either. Just not realizing they shouldn't take your life for granted.", "NTA. Your parents are going to lose both children if they keep neglecting you.", "NAH. Just because he's dying doesn't mean you no longer need attention and care.

I suspect this will seem much less important then.", "NAH", "I don't think calling you an AH will help at all.  All I can say is you are going to miss him when he's gone.  Do you really want this to be what you remember?  Being angry about him getting attention?  I don't think so.  I'm willing to bet you're a good person, and you're frustrated and maybe even terrified of losing him.  You have every right to want attention from your parents.  And I can't imagine how that whole situation must be for you.  I stress the losing him part though.  You can't ever get this time back.  Don't spend it in anger.", "Depends on your relationship with family after your brother passes. If it\u2019s TERMINAL cancer, your brother obviously won\u2019t be expected to be around you and your family for many decades to come. You expectedly will be. If he has a virtual guaranteed death prognosis then it\u2019s understandable why the entire family is focusing on him rn and overwhelmed.", "NTA - but\u2026 you\u2019re 18. Old enough to understand what\u2019s going on so why wouldn\u2019t you be involved  or invited to spend time with him?

It would be great for you to have a safe place to process ALL of your feelings. Wishing you and your family peace and comfort during this sad and awful time.", "NAH maybe your mom. Having a sick kid sucks. Having a sick brother sucks. Being so completely ignored you couldn\u2019t get a Happy Birthday let alone a cake \ud83c\udf82 and party hats \ud83e\udd73 really sucks! \n\nYour mom\u2019s reaction sucks. Unless she is normally terrible it was probably her grief.", "NAH.

It seems like a terrible situation all around. Sorry for this tough time your family is going through.", "NAH\n\nYou are young, it's hard to understand how devastating this must be for your parents\n\nAnd it's normal to want to be seen as an individual\n\nYou just need to realize that others are not in that mode and can't just shake off their feelings.", "NTA. Your mom called you jealous, which is not the right word at all. You have emotional needs that aren't being met which is, tragically, very common in siblings of sick kids. Unfortunately there's no easy fix for this - I know it's extremely common for said siblings to go no contact with family after these kinds of issues.\n\nPlease keep in mind it's not personal. I'd definitely suggest trying to find some kind of therapy or support group in your area for this issue. The oncology unit your brother goes to probably has resources for you. Good luck.", "NTA. Unless your brother is going to pass imminently  your mother's response was awful.  I'm shocked your mother could not have at least had some minor apology for forgetting your birthday and given you a hug.  That's really all she needed to do and then get back to focusing on your brother.  \n\nAs a cancer survivor having a distraction like a sibling's bd would actually be a relief to not focus on being sick 24/7. \n\nOP, I'm so sorry for you and your family.

Sending so much love, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA. It's actually quite common when one sibling is sick that the healthy sibling feels neglected (often because they are). Grief counselors actually warn parents against isolating their healthy children as it breeds resentment.\n\nJust because you're brother is dying doesn't mean you don't deserve to be wished a happy birthday. Nor does it mean you deserve to be excluded. It sounds like they put you on the back burner when you were still a minor, and it's continued into your adulthood. That would be upsetting to a lot of people. While I understand that your mother is already grieving the loss of a child, that still doesn't mean how you've been treated is okay. You're not disgusting, and your feelings are not only valid but extremely common.\n\nAlso, I think people are completely missing that you are not actually jealous of the extra attention your brother is receiving but are more just asking not to be treated as an afterthought. It also sounds like you want to have memories as a family while he's still around, thus the desire to be included. All of this is reasonable.\n\nEdit: Also, Happy Birthday, OP.", "NTA. You can have more than one feeling. You can feel bad for your brother AND feel like your family is ignoring you. Because they are. I don't think you are jealous of your brother, but just left out. Is it possible to get family therapy? Your parents probably need someone to talk to too.", "NTA. The movie 16 candles is about a family forgetting their daughters 16th birthday because of their older daughters wedding. Not the same as cancer but it's definitely a theme.", "NTA\n\nI might be biased because I've been in a similar situation. Growing up, my older sibling was going through a lot of physical and mental health issues. As a result, a lot of the focus was on them and I often felt like I was left to my own devices. It's not a fun feeling. Your parents are suppose to be your people, they're suppose to look out for you and care for you. And when you get ignored, it really, really hurts. For me, it got to the point where I didn't even feel like I could go to them for help because it would only burden them when they had so much on their plate already and I should just handle it on my own. \n\nWhat really sucks about those situations is that you can't really blame others for wanting to give more attention to someone who is sick. Of course they do! And being terminally ill, I'm sure that makes every moment with your brother even more special. Still, it doesn't mean you have to be left out. You should be involved in these memories too, after. Why can't they just think of you more too? I mean, doesn't your brother want to spend time with you too? I'm sure he'd be grateful for more company. \n\nI'd try sitting down again with your parents. Make it clear you completely understand why they give him so much more attention. Youre upset too, you care about your brother too, you want to be there for him too. This isn't about jealousy, though, this is about neglect. It doesn't have to be either/or here, they can spend more time and care with your brother and still acknowledge and include you. You're also their child. \n\nI think it was wrong of your mom to call you disgusting for voicing your feelings. This is completely normal to feel this way especially when you are actively being left out of things.", "NTA. I've been in this exact situation. I turned 16 and we didn't have a birthday party, we had a \\*my sister's name\\* is cancer free for 1 month party. It's rough. As a younger sibling to someone with cancer, you inevitably end up on the back burner. It's important to communicate how you feel. Don't necessarily complain about what they're doing, because they are probably trying their best, but just communicate what YOU're going through. They aren't the only ones affected by your brother being sick, and if they don't try to keep you in their lives, they may end up losing 2 children...", "NTA! You aren't jealous of your brother, who are scared but you are also needing to be shown love and support as well. Talk to others in your family and just let them know how you feel.", "NTA, but clarify that you aren't jealous that he has cancer, but that he has ALL of EVERYONES attention. \n\nYou are still very young and it's absolutely fair to feel the way you do when being pushed to the back burner... But don't spend the last of your brothers time resenting him... Not saying you do I am just saying in case", "NTA. Mom is for taking out her feeling of being called-out over being focused exclusively on your brother and making an unfounded accusation.\n\nA person can believe two things at the same time--that it's objectively awful that her brother is going to die but also, simultaneously, that she doesn't want to become a non-person to her family. She needs her family, too, and it's okay to feel however you feel. Nobody really controls their feelings, they control their reactions to them.\n\nSo it's okay to feel this way, what's more important, is being aware of the fact that you feel both things at the same time and not taking it out on your brother.\n\nAll of this sucks a lot, and it's terrible you get to face this at such a young age.

I definitely think your mom responded wrong, but remember she\u2019s also loosing a child, so that\u2019s why I said NAH.

I have been through too many people passing from cancer and it is not pretty and is typically very painful at the end, if not before.  You will most likely have a lifetime of time with your parents.
