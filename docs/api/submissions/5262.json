Hormones literally messes with her feeling. Most people think its a \"cop-out \" but I repeat shes growing a human. Besides she is allowed to change her mind. The only reason she might be in the wrong is she didn't tell her sister first.", "My thoughts exactly. \n\nNTA", "I agree. They hired the sister, she got paid. If I was the sister, I would be like. Well I got paid, so not my problem.", "Not just an interior designer, TWO interior designers. The lives of others are fascinating and bizarre...", "So are we just throwing away the rest of the house? Lol", "have you ever been pregnant ? cause this all seems like normal pregnancy symptoms", "Have you ever heard of depression? People who are pregnant are at a MUCH higher risk for it! It can cause some irrational behavior, but ideally they have partners to help them handle it. ( NAH, OP's only crime is Feeling Sad. Armchair psychologists of Reddit have decided to regress to deeming \"crying excessively\" a sign of \"hysteria,\" and I hope OP doesn't take it to heart)", "Werner Herzogs new line of sad beige nursery decor for sad beige children.", "I get what you\u2019re getting at but we could probably say the same about some of the items you own, and how they are less important than the troubles in the world.\n\nI agree. But glass houses man", "Ya, personally I'd go NAH, but I can't see at ALL how the wife is the asshole for - crying. That's literally all she's done.", "Yeah, just yesterday I started crying violently for about three minutes for literally no reason except I guess I was tired. I kept telling my wife that nothing was wrong, apparently the 36-week hormones just decided now it was time to cry. These things happen.", "For a split second I thought architects Herzog De Meuron did a beige nursery line - I'm so grateful that is not true. Haven't seen the other Herzogs new line of beige - don't think we have a single beige item in our house.", "\"Excessive sadness\" is a sign of \"hysteria,\" which is a sign of an emotionally manipulative person, don't you know? /s\n\n(Poor OP is clearly going through it and her husband jumped the gun. He should have called the sister and explained what happened, but they all need to calm down and talk it out)", "Yeah, he could have been making OP question is. Problem is that we don't know.", "Some people (myself included) feel it\u2019s very important to pay artisans their dues regardless of who they are. I\u2019m in a fortunate enough position that I\u2019ve been able to hire family members and compensate them for their skill and labor. Sometimes they refuse and do it for free. Sometimes they just ask for materials to be covered. Sometimes they\u2019re just really appreciative. We also don\u2019t know if they paid her for labour, or just materials. Like\u2026 furniture is expensive, so is paint, so is pretty much any remodeling project. Obviously the sister can\u2019t be expected to work for free AND supply the materials. So \u201chiring her\u201d could mean anything from fully compensating her to just paying for materials\u2026 we don\u2019t know without clarification.\n\nRegardless of how they hired her though\u2026 I can get why designer sister would be upset that her own sibling didn\u2019t come to her right away with her complaints as soon as they happened. If I was OP in this situation I probably would have called my brother, crying, blubbering about how badly I feel but unfortunately I no longer like the nursery. He\u2019d probably make fun of me a little and then come over and work with me to fix it\u2014which I imagine is why OP\u2019s sister feels upset.\n\nMy verdict would be NAH (except maybe OP\u2019s husband\u2026 why wouldn\u2019t he have talked to OP\u2019s sister for her first instead of hiring an outside designer? This was always headed for a massive blowup because when sister eventually comes over to see her neice/nephew she\u2019s GONNA notice the nursery is totally different lol. Would have saved this whole conflict if he\u2019d talked to sister first\u2026 but I get he just wanted to make his wife happy so I\u2019m tentatively not considering him the AH).", "Yeah and who knows how OP was crying. When people say cry that can mean a lot of things. It can mean tears, screams, words, all three together. Did she blame the sister for not liking the turn out in her upset?\n\nIt might in a small way be Op\u2019s fault husband did what he did and how he did it.\n\nIf he thought she was upset with the cousin for the work she doesn\u2019t like, he might think it\u2019s better to not involve the cousin at all.\n\nI get a husband wanting to make his wife feel better but maybe the way OP cried about it would make the outcome what it was vs a different solution.\n\nI think there\u2019s just not enough context here"]}
