Yes, it is your nursery room and yes, you ultimately get to decide what happens and who designs it. But your father is right. Your sister must have spent a lot of time and effort to design, map out and work on the nursery room. You've been crying about this issue for a while it seems.

However, it absolutely makes sense that if you are this upset over it, then you may not have actually ever liked it to begin with. Hiring someone else also shows you don't feel good to give your sister feedback or what was wrong. I always suggest never using family for home repairs, designs etc. to avoid drama. So, it sounds like you are making the best choice for yourself. I think your sister's assumptions are valid and she has a right to feeling rejected.

And, anyway, a baby is **safest**, by *a lot*, in the parents\u2019 room for at least the first 6 mos.  So you had plenty of time to deal with this.  The baby doesn\u2019t care about the nursery, after all, a baby wants nothing to do with a nursery.", "YTA the least you could have done was tell your sister you were having second thoughts about it and wanted to change it.

She loved it at first, something changed and she didn't anymore. She doesn't HAVE to consult anyone about changes in her own home. She even says she hired her sister, that implies payment was made somewhere along the line. No one is owed a second chance for anything, and again, SHE LOVED IT AT FIRST.
