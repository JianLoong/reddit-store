She is dangerous to your family.  She has already poisoned the well with your extended family.  Imagine if you allowed her to stay around and she decided to directly fuck around with your children's peace of mind for the lulz!

Maybe you should have a talk with your sister first?", "NTA. I don't know who your source is, but you need corroboration from other people that this took place. It is weird that no one clued you or your wife in before this. Does your sister slag off other people to you?

I do question why these people she told this to didn't tell her to shut up.    I would question anything this woman did in the future because she stabbed your wife in the back.

Your sister - understood, she is toxic. But I think the rest of your family/friends need to take a good look at themselves and ask (1) why didn't they try to stop it, and (2) why didn't they tell you?\n\nMy guess is (if your mom is anything like mine), she felt playing \"happy family\" was more important than either shutting Sis down (sounds like Sis would make someone's life miserable for doing that), or sharing it so you could make your own decision about how to interact with her.\n\nBut her obsession with \"oh let's just minimize this\" puts you and your wife in a terrible position.

Be careful with her.\" sort of way.  Not to tell me that my sister was saying this trash, but to warn me.  I'm livid with her.\n\nWe've been married for nearly 2 decades.  We have the best relationship in the world. We're best friends.  Everybody else in my family has terrible relationships with their spouses.", "The thing that baffles me is, I'm quite gossipy. I'll share all sorts of stories. My favourite was the time I told everyone at work about my managers divorce, long before it was public knowledge (I literally made it public knowlege, I'd learnt it from a mutual friend) because he had really inappropriately told me about someone else's mental health struggles and I figured at that point his personal issues were fair game. That was great! Then all the associated speculation of the reason for the divorce. It was a pastime for a couple weeks! (That said, if someone tells me something and makes it clear it's private though then I'll never share it - it's been over a decade since someone told me a very juicy secret, it's not at all juicy any more, it's more a funny story, and I *still* haven't shared it with anyone because I was asked not to)\n\nBut the sister has just fully made this up?

I'd be going NC or VLC with your mother. That's just not forgivable. \n\nLet me put it this way: Your low-class, lying, gossiping, backstabbing sister is accusing your WIFE of being trash?

It's theirs. I don't gossip the way I don't go around using items that don't belong to me without permission.", "If you are even going to even consider maintaining a relationship, you should insist that the first step be a family meeting \u2014 in front of your wife and parents \u2014 in which you ask her to explain why she said the things she did.\n\nIf she can't handle being confronted or taking ownership of what she's done, then she doesn't love you enough to merit a place in your life.\n\nNTA", "Or because it's so similar to the stench of her own bullshit"]}
