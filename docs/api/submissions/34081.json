This friend's grandfather had survived said bombing and she described her experience as \"watching him melt in slow motion\". The rule I implemented, which my brother seems to follow too, is that my parents aren't allowed to meet anyone that I'm friends with or am romantically involved with.  \n\n\nWell, Christmas came and we were at my dad's house (with my brother's Chinese wife and Nigerian friend, so you can guess what comments were made) and my stepmom was asking about when I'd bring friends around and when I'd start dating and introduce them.
