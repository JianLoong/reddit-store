There should be more respect for your home and things especially if not contributing. How many toilet rolls at one time does she need?? Why is 1 roll at at time not enough, this seems extremely reasonable to me, take one - use one - get another - simple! Toilet roll is like gold dust in my house regardless of how many I buy! I have a secret \"luxury wiper\" living here who needs a roll per poop it would seem. I've solved this issue by resorting to bringing a roll from my work place home with me to ensure I always have some available", "Tell your mum they can come live with her then.

You can still use the unfinished ones, right?\n\nJust leave a few in there and don\u2019t refill it until they are used. Not too complicated", "I'm with your mom on this one.  Who cares?  Yeah, I get how it can be a bit annoying for them to not completely finish a roll, but if that's the worst of your problems then it's really not that bad.   \n  \nIf it bothers you so much, grab all the partial rolls every once in a while and bring them to your bathroom to use up. Then you're not wasting anything.", "NTA-  that\u2019s wasting money.  Just tell her she have to buy their own toilet paper and you will still buy the rest of the groceries.   When she see how much toilet paper they use and not used maybe they will stop.  She still will be able to save money to move out.  People loves to waste other people money.", "ESH. What happens when they run out while in the bathroom? They\u2019re being really weird about TP but you are too. Maybe have two rolls to be safe and just replenish another when one is done.", "NTA - this is probably why your sister doesn\u2019t have her own house - she\u2019s wasteful and doesn\u2019t care about money.", "NTA. First, it's your house and her and her kids are guests there. Second, you've already told her that she's wasting TP for no good reason and you have politely asked her stop and she hasn't. Third, if she isn't contributing to groceries or bills she has zero say in what YOU do with YOUR TP. Is it ridiculous and a silly thing to get in an argument over? Yes. However, it is still YOUR home, YOUR product, and YOUR rules? Also yes. If she doesn't like you doing whatever you wish with your groceries, I would tell her she is more than welcome to go out and buy all the TP her little heart desires.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA!! WTH? They don\u2019t even chip in and just waste your TP?? I\u2019d do the same thing!! If your mom thinks it\u2019s a problem she can go buy some TP for them to waste.", "Well tell her it is now her responsibility to buy the tp.. keep some stashed in your room for you though. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. She can keep her drama to herself or move back in with mommy.", "NTA-sounds like you\u2019re doing a lot for your sister and her kids the least they can do is not be wasteful. I will never understand why some people feel so entitled when someone else is literally taking care of them. Just wondering how old you are and how old the sister is?", "The issue I see here is the fact that she went to your parents for an issue she had with YOU in YOUR HOME.\n\nWhat happens in YOUR HOUSE has nothing to do with anyone else.\n\nYou are being generous by helping your sister and her children out. They should learn to show a little more appreciation by NOT wasting what they DO NOT buy.\n\n>Edit: Her kids aren't the only ones that do it, my sister does as well.\n\nWell. Now we know ***why*** your sister is a tattle tale. WTF!!\n\nCould she please grow up and act like the adult that she is and claims to be. Perhaps then yoy might actually treat her like one.\n\nNTA", "That's pretty much why I'm not asking her to help pay for groceries. I can foot the grocery bill so she can save up faster to get them their own place.", "Since OP\u2019s mom is insisting that it\u2019s a \u2018non-issue\u2019, maybe the sister and kids should move in with mom and dad. \n\nOP is being incredibly generous by letting them stay for free\u2026being respectful and not wasting OP\u2019s money is the bare minimum that they should be doing.", "The kids are 5 and 9, and I would expect that from kids but not an adult.", "OMG! LOL! I have a \u201cluxury wiper\u201d in my house too! It\u2019s my stepson. I\u2019ve never in my life seen anyone use so much toilet paper in my life!", "This is pretty much the only problem we have going on.", "I've taken some wet rolls out of there when they put it on the sink, or they simply have no intention of using the tissue and either throw it out or let them pile up. Record of unfinished rolls I've taken out of both bathrooms at once was 5.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA but maybe they can provide their own TP. I have a feeling if she actually had to pay for it she\u2019ll be less likely to waste it and if they do continue to waste it it won\u2019t bother you as much", "Send her to live with mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: **She will never willingly leave.**  She won't move out until you kick her ... You don't even have set a specific timeline, which means: She will stay and spend her money, because having you pay for her and her kids gives her more freedom and fun-money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do some babysitting too, you are the perfect aunt. She will NEVER give that up.", "which is very kind of you! and your kindness makes your sister\u2019s behaviour quite odd. you\u2019re doing her a huge favor, you stopped her and her kids from wasting your money instead of you spending money on them responsibly, and she told on you to your parents? nta, sis needs a reality check.", "That\u2019s actually pretty good situation then. I would be annoyed with the almost empty rolls too since those often end up getting wet or something that makes it unusable. I usually solve the problem by taking the leftover toilet paper from the roll and making a neat pile at suitable spot.", "YOur other problem is that she is not really saving up for her own place, and that she has NO intenion to ever leave. Why would she leave? This is PARADISE for her, she would lose much if she got her own place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Have you even discussed a timeline? If not, it's \"a few years\" at minimum, maybe decades. She will make sure never to have enough money to actually move out.", "Nope they can have 1 and go to the time out corner.", "She does have a timeline for moving out.", "Yeah sure. Ask her how much she has already saved for her new home."]}
