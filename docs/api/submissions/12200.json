I have 4 sons (27, 19, 16, 13) and a daughter (14). My house has 5 bedrooms with 3 rooms for the kids upstairs and a bedroom in the basement. I originally built a bedroom in the basement for my eldest son and then when he moved out it went to my next oldest. My 19 y.o son is now in his sophomore year of college in a different state. Originally when he left for college my 16 y.o son begged for his brother's room, but I told him no. All the kids had their own rooms upstairs and I wanted my son to still have a space to come back to. He ended up living with me for almost all of last summer as he was working nearby and was still dating his high school girlfriend.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for around 1.5 years. She is a single mom and hasn't been receiving any child support from her son's father. She has been struggling financially for as long as I've known her, and she refuses any time I try to help her financially. Recently I was able to convince her to move in with me so she can achieve her plans of going back to college.\n\nTo accommodate her son, I gave my 16 y.o the basement bedroom and gave his room to my gf's son. I let my 19 y.o know in advance I was doing this and bought a pull-out couch for the den in the basement so that could be his space whenever he wants to stay at home. I knew my son was upset about this because the basement has been his space for so long and he still visits home regularly. \n\nAs I was making over a bedroom for the 5 y.o, I decided to give all the bedrooms a makeover as it had been a while. All the kids got new paint, some got new furniture, and some other decorative type things. My daughter sent him video/pics of some of the rooms and he replied back with something super passive aggressive about me only giving the rooms a makeover now he's moved out and my gf's moved in. I gave him a call to talk to him because I didn't understand why he was so upset. He said some hurtful things about my gf (when he had previously liked her) and told me it felt like I was pushing him out the house for good. I tried to reason with him, but he wouldn't listen. AITA? He lives the majority of the year in a different state for college and is an adult, is it wrong for me to give away his bedroom?", "created_utc": 1678715250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qa77r/aita_for_giving_my_sons_bedroom_to_my_girlfriends/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re making room and trying to accommodate the kids who are living in the home full time. Sure it sucks for your kid in college, but ffs, he still has a home to come back to\u2014you aren\u2019t kicking him out on the street.", "NTA - I get your son being upset but he shouldn\u2019t insult your gf. He\u2019s moved out and the situation in the house has changed. The room cant just be empty until he wants to use it.", "Not gonna call you an AH as it sounds like your trying your best. I'll try explain it from the perspective of your kid/kids without saying whether its right or wrong. You didn't let our own 16 y.o. have the basement room, despite begging, but are letting the 5 y.o. stepkid have his room, and give the 16 y.o. what he wants because of it (not because he asked). He probably hasn't complained as he is getting what he originally wanted (the basement) but will see this, and probably feel it too. This will, to all your children, make it sound like you are prioritising her kid over your own, which you are. \n\nYour eldest spent the whole of last summer there, would you spend a whole summer on a pull out bed in a den? By restricting his ability to come home he will feel that he has less option in general of what to do. He worked last summer so clearly isn't an entitled brat or anything like that. In his position, I would feel that I am no longer welcome to come home for exteded periods of time, and would be uncomfortable, both physically and emotionally doing so.\n\nObviously we don't know the whole story re. your new GF but regardless of the child support situation she was getting by for the last 1.5 years without you providing a room for her kid. The full makeovers to all the rooms would also likely make the other kids feel like they weren't worth the effort but the new kid is.  \n\nOverall, you've done something for the new kid that you didn't do for yours. This will upset all of them. They aren't saying anything as they have got upgrades, whereas the 19 y.o. who has been downgraded, and feels slighted, has nothing to lose by complaining.", "Your son is old enough to realize that a FIVE-YEAR-OLD CHILD needs the space more than he does, as he's no longer living with you full-time, whereas your gf's kid is... He's acting like a five-year-old. NTA", "YTA\n\nYou acknowledged your sons needs to maintain a room at your home, you communicated this to your 16 year old, about the importance your eldest son still having this space is. Then without warning you turn around and kick him out of his room so that your young gf of only a year and half can move in. So your sons needs where only important when it didn't impact your love life? \n\nEffectively for 3 months of the year, your son no longer has a home, he has to sofa surf. You didn't even make arrangements for him to have a actual bed. Wtf is that about. What happens when he finishes his education before he gets his first job, is he not welcome in your home? I mean he is no longer welcome at weekends or over summer - can't see the 16 year old welcoming him and his gf into his space because you put a sofa in there. \n\nYour entitled to your life, but the way you went about this is horrible. Is your new gf worth damaging the relationship with all your kids - I doubt your other three kids are impressed at the treatment of their brother.", "YTA", "YTA\n\n Your kids should come first.", "YTA \n\nAs someone who was in your 19y old's shoes a couple of years back, I relate to his anger toward you as a parent. I had to watch my mom bend over backward for her boyfriend and his cleptomaniac daughter (she'd snoop into my room and steal my art supply every single time I was away). She had renovated parts of the home for this kid when she had left stuff on the back burner for years, all that for the relationship to last about a year and for the dude to decide to leave because the \"city wasn't doing it for him\" or whatever.\n\nYou need to understand that in the eyes of your children, the new gf and her kid are nothing more than strangers they'll have to tolerate and learn to deal with whether they like it or not, that the situation was imposed on them and they have little to no control on what dad will decide at the end of the day. It seriously sucks to have to deal with that type of change as a teen, especially when dad decides to shove you out of the nest out of the blue to accommodate someone new. Maybe have a real discussion with your family instead of being sneaky? Also, 19y old are not adult, wtf.", "YTA Most college students like to come back to their old bedroom and find it comforting. It's common for kids to move back home for a couple of years after college. You made your girlfriend and her kid seem more important.", "It appears you didn\u2019t discuss this with your son before you made the decision. You were going to do this anyway, but I think your son deserved the courtesy of a heads up before you did this, so I\u2019m going with a mild YTA.  I hope you can smooth things over with him when he comes home on break.", "Originally when he left for college my 16 y.o son begged for his brother's room, but I told him no. All the kids had their own rooms upstairs and I wanted my son to still have a space to come back to.\n\nbut BAM you gave it up for your girlfriend's kid........\n\nYTA \n\nThe only way to accomplish this is to sub-divide your own bedroom to accommodate the bonus kid. You set your children's expectations of you. 13-19 is a little late to change the game plan.", "INFO: What's the age difference between you and the GF? That may well be the root cause of your issue", "YTA, you do not give your children\u2019s rooms away to your girlfriend\u2019s son.", "YTA.", "YTA for not considering how he felt. Why not turn the den into his room? So it\u2019s his space. Then when he moves for good turn it back into a den. He feels pushed out for a gf you\u2019ve had for a year & 1/2. Try to figure out a solution like the one mentioned above or figure out another one.", "Ppl can go back and forth about the house factors but I see it boiling down to this if you didn't discuss moving rooms with your son before you did it you broke his trust, you made him feel less valuable in your life than your girlfriend and her young son, especially after the younger sibling wanted it. There may be added baggage if you get to be more/different of a father figure in the 5yr olds life than your own older kids not to mention the girlfriend factors. Add on the room updates that he wasn't involved in, he'll feel even more like he's out of the loop. Can you really not remember how much everything felt at 19. Right or wrong at a minimum you hurt his feelings and didn't even have the awareness to talk first to see if there could be compromise/resolution just tfb and reddit aita. Smh. Involving him in the den refresh to be more his space might have helped but to think it was not going to affect anything is pretty myopic. Kids at 19 mostly can't communicate those points at least the kids I know.", "YTA for how you did it but not for wanting change.  Hope you\u2019re ready for your \u201cadult\u201d son to boycott coming home all together.  Why would he want to sleep on a sofa bed and share a room with a 5 y/o.  At least you have a new son now!", "YTA. Bro, I\u2019d be hurt if my pops did this ! You\u2019ve only known her for a year? Big mistake imo. I did this with a single woman no kids and regret it. Luckily I have no kids so it wasn\u2019t an issue. I\u2019d never put a woman over me or my \u201cfuture\u201d kids.", "Yta for not talking to your son first before you moved him out. You told him. That isn't talking. Gonna be awhile to make up for that betrayal of trust from you.", "YTA. From your post it seems like he was still regularly using the room at your home and I can understand why he might feel like you're pushing him out. You let him know but it doesn't seem as though you asked his opinion. There could have possibly been a compromise somewhere if you had a proper discussion with him in advance.", "Yta, it's practical I recognise that but he lives temporarily away for college, going from having his own room to a pull out like a guest is a big deal. And you simply let him know instead of considering his opinion before you did this", "YTA, since you glossed over it I'm going to assume you didn't talk to him about the move first, or the redecorating before they happened. Having no control over the situation because you're the boss is one thing, no involvement in discussion or heads up is another. I'd feel like your son too in that he's taken out of the loop.  It could be a bad assumption, tell me I'm wrong?", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your son was coming home regularly, and now you've made it so he can't stay comfortably ever again. All so you can get with a girl almost half your age and 2 years older than your oldest kid.\n\nHope the almost 20-year age gap relationship is worth losing your son over.\n\nEdit: a phrase", "Info: did he actually move out or does he just stay on campus during the school year? If he\u2019s just in campus housing he has to leave during summers and other times of the year and does he have a place to stay now that you\u2019ve made it obvious your house is no longer his home? There\u2019s a big difference between him having private housing that\u2019s his home and staying on campus.\n\nI\u2019m saying YTA until you state he has permanent housing of his own.", "YTA you did push him out and he\u2019ll never trust you again. How does it feel to know you lost your own son to make your gf and her child happy?", "NTA\n\nHe's 19 and out of the house.  That room should to have to sit empty.  Your son still has a place to stay and knows he is welcome.  This is a sometimes painful part of growing up.  He'll get over it.", "Info: if he moves back for the summer again, will you make space for him that is not a pull out couch?", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NAH. I understand why your son is upset, but he\u2019s only there occasionally. You need to make space for the people who live there all the time. Why should two of the other kids have to share a room, so that your soon has his own room for those times he\u2019s in the house? That room would sit empty the rest of the time. It makes no sense (to me, anyway).", "NTA. A 19-year-old is old enough to recognize that things change when they leave for college.", "Changed to NAH\n\nEssentially he isn't there for most of the year, yeah it sucks he's losing his space and I can totally understand his hurt but it makes sense and unfortunately for him there was always going to need to be some sort of compromise and in my opinion this is the best option.\nYour partner moved in with her son, what did he expect you to do, short of building an extension?\n\nYour options were:\n\n-16 year old and 13 year old share a room, basement is empty most of the year.\n\n-19 year old shares with the 5 year old when he comes back (doubt he'd want that).\n\n-19 year old shares with the 16 year old when he's home (current plan and makes the most sense).\n\nHonestly some parents begin charging rent at 18, would he be willing to pay to keep the basement empty all year?\n\n\nEdit to add:\n\nIs there a way to split the basement into two bedrooms? Then you can put a bed in his section instead of a couch and he can still have 'his space'", "NTA - since when do children (and yes, I mean your 19 yo) get to dictate who gets to live in what room in your home and what gets a makeover or not.  \nIs he paying rent to hold a room in your house?? Of course not.  \nWhere does he want to live in 2 years when college is over? Back to Daddy's rent free, or is he planning on moving on to adult life? He sounds spoiled and I would just tell him that until/unless things change, he is welcome and encouraged to come home while in college and sleep in the den; or find a friend to stay with in town. Don't cave!", ">He ended up living with me for almost all of last summer as he was working nearby and was still dating his high school girlfriend.\n\n>I knew my son was upset about this because the basement has been his space for so long and he still visits home regularly.\n\n>He said some hurtful things about my gf (when he had previously liked her) and told me it felt like I was pushing him out the house for good.\n\nNAH You're not necessarily wrong for giving the room to someone who will use it more but he no longer can comfortably stay at home and work over the summer. You're also basically saying he can't come back after college. He now has to plan on either getting a full time job immediately after graduation (difficult and possibly impossible) or living in your basement den while he looks for work. He knows this is due to your girlfriend's kid and you wanting to help *her* through college so of course he feels resentful that you've chosen them over him.", "NTA-Spoiled entitled kids think this way.", "NTA.  He's old enough to understand that you need to repurpose the space.  It's selfish of him to demand that you keep a whole room reserved just for him to use occasionally, when there's a child living there 24/7 who needs the space.", "NTA - smallest boy gets smallest bedroom.\n\nWhen my daughter left for college her brother was instantly busy moving all his stuff into the bigger room. It's part of the moving up, moving on, moving out process.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult, he\u2019s away at college, and you provided him with a pull out bed if he needs a place to stay. He\u2019s being childish.", "NAH. It\u2019s your house and your heart is in the right place, but your son feels like he lost his home and he\u2019s hurt.  That\u2019s understandable.  And it\u2019s notable that you weren\u2019t willing to do this change before - because you saw value in your son keeping his bedroom and having a home base.  You started to value that less when your girlfriend and her child came into the picture not that long ago\u2026 Your son is correct that the value you placed on him having a home base changed when she came into the picture.  That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s wrong, but he is technically correct and he\u2019s allowed to feel some sort of way about it.", "NTA. The 19 yr old is out of the house, yeah he might come back and visit regularly but it doesn\u2019t mean everyone else\u2019s life stops in the mean time, plus he\u2019s also an adult now anyway, he should realise how lucky he was that you went to so much effort in the first place to provide him with his own space. I think the main thing that yeah this 19YO (who already moved out) is saying he feels displaced? I can guarantee you that the 5YO feels farrrrrr more displaced and probably confused. I think it\u2019s probably super important for you and your partner to make sure he feels like he has his own secure space right now. Talk to the 19YO about that, and if he still feels his needs outweigh everyone else\u2019s then it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve done all you can and he\u2019s just being selfish at that point.", "NTA", "NAH-\n Son is obviously hurt, sounds like family is super close, and he spends a lot of time at home, and you didn\u2019t let him know until after the fact. You\u2019re doing what you feel is the right move, but he feels displaced, even if he\u2019s in college and growing up that\u2019s his safe place, and he feels like it\u2019s gone. I recommend taking your son out to eat alone, and try to work on these feelings, and make sure the other kids are on the same page. Whether you like it or not you\u2019ve changed everyone\u2019s living situation, and people are going to feel displaced even if that wasn\u2019t the goal. You\u2019ve moved in 2 new people. One of whom is only 5 YO, and he\u2019s going to be a challenge for the older kids to get used to, and one of them has lost their room to him, so there\u2019s going to be resentment whether you like it, or feel it\u2019s appropriate. No assholes, but you\u2019ve got a challenge ahead of you, and you need to start talking to your kids before you make moves that might make them feel displaced. While your son is in college and becoming an adult, college is temporary, and until he has his ducks in a row, that\u2019s still his home, and he\u2019s lost his safe space and privacy.

Doesn't make sense to have an empty bedroom most of the year. Who cares if you said no to the 16yr old this year. You would have a much bigger problem if you put that 5yr old in the room with a teenager", "NTA, this literally happened to me lol. My room went to my step siblings when I moved out for college. It sucks cause there is a feeling of your safe place going away. The end of childhood. But you just gotta deal with it as an adult.", "YTA.  Your son is only 19.  Yes, he\u2019s at college, but your house is still his home, his safe harbor, where he comes for the summer and extended breaks.  His bedroom symbolizes that.  You\u2019ve essentially kicked him out, in his mind.  He no longer has a room there, so it\u2019s not his home, he\u2019s sleeping on a couch, so he\u2019s \u201cjust a guest\u201d.  He will not feel comfortable or welcome on extended visits anymore.  If you had waited until he graduated college, gotten his first real job, my judgement would be different, but he\u2019s still a kid.  I feel sad for him, because I am positive he\u2019s hurting from this.  He insulted your GF because he\u2019s lashing out at the person he perceives is the cause of him being displaced, but soon enough he\u2019ll recognize that the blame is all yours, and it will be a rift in your relationship.  Good luck, OP.  Not sure how you are going to fix this with him.  (FWIW, I have a son the same age so I do have some idea how they think and how much they value \u201chome\u201d).", "Yeah, this is the problem. The 19 yr old is at school and doesn't have a permanent home. He thought of dad's as his home. Most kids spend some time after college at home trying to land a good job or saving enough to be able to find a place to live. He no longer has the option. He can't spend 3-6 months in the basement in everyone's way w/ no privacy. If he were  22, out of school and had a job, it wouod be a completely different story, but offically, the 19 yr old is still living w/ OP and OP'shome is his home and primary residence.\n\nOP could have had an adult conversation w/ his son and worked through other possible solutions w/ him before finalizing any plans and moving the GF in. \n\nIn addition, OP has only been dating her a year and a half. Moving families in together at this point is really an aggressive timeline and it sounds like the decision was made partially due to financial reasons, which is never a good reason to make this level of change that will have such a huge impact on so many lives.", "He''s away at school - he should be thrilled he has a place to crash when he is back in town.\n\nAs to the others, life in general is ever changing; nothing stays the same. If you don't teach your kids at a young age how to handle change and disappointments you are doing them a disservice.", "Agree with this, YTA, specifically not letting the 16 have it bc the 19 was still coming home for breaks and summers. He said he wanted him to have his own space now he\u2019s relegated to a pull out couch. Plus a lot of kids need to move back after college so this kid is currently in limbo.

Neither son had any issues coming home and sleeping on the couch for a weekend.  \nThis 19 year old spoiled boy needs to grow up!", "OP did let the son know in advance", "Why does a 19 year old's opinion matter here? He's away at college, he needs to grow up and realize that not everything revolves around him when he's home. Is he expecting to graduate and live at home?  \nThis dad has every right to do what he feels is best in his own home.

It makes no sense he'd be bothered by this...\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He had his oldest when he was 17. And he's only 15 years older.", "That really doesn't matter. Homegirl has a kid and has been doing it on her own. She is probably mature enough to decide how she wants to spend her life. Two grown adults doing their thing. Grow up", "Exactly.  Dad even said he comes home a lot but somehow thought he\u2019d just be ok with all his private space and belongings getting shoved aside.  Oh and the bonus is he gets a sofa bed now!  How OP is ready for his \u201cadult\u201d son to stop coming home all together.  I certainly wouldn\u2019t come home to share a room with a 5 y/o.", "I'm not saying that he shouldn't parent him at all. But plenty of kids share rooms and him being an adult (and not living at home) means he really doesn't need his own room all year. Personally I'd be trying to wall off part of the basement.\n\nThis is definitely a NAH situation as i can see why he would be upset.", "But why would there need to be a discussion in his house that he pays the bills for?", "Im also wondering how he explained the situation to his son, like he didn\u2019t even asked him how he feels about that or anything (that how it sounds) just let him know what he is doing with HIS ROOM. It\u2019s still his room, just because he moved out doesn\u2019t mean that he isn\u2019t allowed to say anything about the situation. I would be upset too if my father is giving my room to a 5 year old who he doesn\u2019t even really know yet and then when i move out he is giving every bedroom a make over? That\u2019s an asshole move and i don\u2019t get it why people think its not.", "When I went to college my parents immediately repurposed my room without telling me and I dealt with it because that\u2019s their house and I don\u2019t live there anymore. I have a place to sleep if I visit but it\u2019s not my home anymore and hasn\u2019t been since I moved out. It hurts like all like transitions hurt to some extent but it\u2019s not the end of the world and it\u2019s a natural part of life. Not sure why you think this 19 year old needs to be coddled like this. It\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t have a place to go. His father seems very considerate.\n\nHe\u2019s not sharing with a 5 year old. He\u2019s sharing the basement with his teenage brother."]}
