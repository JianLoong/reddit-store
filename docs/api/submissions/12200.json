I have 4 sons (27, 19, 16, 13) and a daughter (14). My house has 5 bedrooms with 3 rooms for the kids upstairs and a bedroom in the basement. I originally built a bedroom in the basement for my eldest son and then when he moved out it went to my next oldest. My 19 y.o son is now in his sophomore year of college in a different state. Originally when he left for college my 16 y.o son begged for his brother's room, but I told him no. All the kids had their own rooms upstairs and I wanted my son to still have a space to come back to. He ended up living with me for almost all of last summer as he was working nearby and was still dating his high school girlfriend.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for around 1.5 years. She is a single mom and hasn't been receiving any child support from her son's father. She has been struggling financially for as long as I've known her, and she refuses any time I try to help her financially. Recently I was able to convince her to move in with me so she can achieve her plans of going back to college.\n\nTo accommodate her son, I gave my 16 y.o the basement bedroom and gave his room to my gf's son. I let my 19 y.o know in advance I was doing this and bought a pull-out couch for the den in the basement so that could be his space whenever he wants to stay at home. I knew my son was upset about this because the basement has been his space for so long and he still visits home regularly. \n\nAs I was making over a bedroom for the 5 y.o, I decided to give all the bedrooms a makeover as it had been a while. All the kids got new paint, some got new furniture, and some other decorative type things. My daughter sent him video/pics of some of the rooms and he replied back with something super passive aggressive about me only giving the rooms a makeover now he's moved out and my gf's moved in. I gave him a call to talk to him because I didn't understand why he was so upset. He said some hurtful things about my gf (when he had previously liked her) and told me it felt like I was pushing him out the house for good. I tried to reason with him, but he wouldn't listen. AITA? He lives the majority of the year in a different state for college and is an adult, is it wrong for me to give away his bedroom?", "created_utc": 1678715250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11qa77r/aita_for_giving_my_sons_bedroom_to_my_girlfriends/", "score": 268, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re making room and trying to accommodate the kids who are living in the home full time. Sure it sucks for your kid in college, but ffs, he still has a home to come back to\u2014you aren\u2019t kicking him out on the street.", "NTA - I get your son being upset but he shouldn\u2019t insult your gf. He\u2019s moved out and the situation in the house has changed. The room cant just be empty until he wants to use it.", "Not gonna call you an AH as it sounds like your trying your best. I'll try explain it from the perspective of your kid/kids without saying whether its right or wrong. You didn't let our own 16 y.o. have the basement room, despite begging, but are letting the 5 y.o. stepkid have his room, and give the 16 y.o. what he wants because of it (not because he asked). He probably hasn't complained as he is getting what he originally wanted (the basement) but will see this, and probably feel it too. This will, to all your children, make it sound like you are prioritising her kid over your own, which you are. \n\nYour eldest spent the whole of last summer there, would you spend a whole summer on a pull out bed in a den? By restricting his ability to come home he will feel that he has less option in general of what to do. He worked last summer so clearly isn't an entitled brat or anything like that. In his position, I would feel that I am no longer welcome to come home for exteded periods of time, and would be uncomfortable, both physically and emotionally doing so.\n\nObviously we don't know the whole story re. your new GF but regardless of the child support situation she was getting by for the last 1.5 years without you providing a room for her kid. The full makeovers to all the rooms would also likely make the other kids feel like they weren't worth the effort but the new kid is.  \n\nOverall, you've done something for the new kid that you didn't do for yours. This will upset all of them. They aren't saying anything as they have got upgrades, whereas the 19 y.o. who has been downgraded, and feels slighted, has nothing to lose by complaining.", "Your son is old enough to realize that a FIVE-YEAR-OLD CHILD needs the space more than he does, as he's no longer living with you full-time, whereas your gf's kid is... He's acting like a five-year-old. NTA", "YTA\n\nYou acknowledged your sons needs to maintain a room at your home, you communicated this to your 16 year old, about the importance your eldest son still having this space is. Then without warning you turn around and kick him out of his room so that your young gf of only a year and half can move in. So your sons needs where only important when it didn't impact your love life? \n\nEffectively for 3 months of the year, your son no longer has a home, he has to sofa surf. You didn't even make arrangements for him to have a actual bed. Wtf is that about. What happens when he finishes his education before he gets his first job, is he not welcome in your home? I mean he is no longer welcome at weekends or over summer - can't see the 16 year old welcoming him and his gf into his space because you put a sofa in there. \n\nYour entitled to your life, but the way you went about this is horrible. Is your new gf worth damaging the relationship with all your kids - I doubt your other three kids are impressed at the treatment of their brother.", "YTA", "YTA\n\n Your kids should come first.", "YTA \n\nAs someone who was in your 19y old's shoes a couple of years back, I relate to his anger toward you as a parent. I had to watch my mom bend over backward for her boyfriend and his cleptomaniac daughter (she'd snoop into my room and steal my art supply every single time I was away). She had renovated parts of the home for this kid when she had left stuff on the back burner for years, all that for the relationship to last about a year and for the dude to decide to leave because the \"city wasn't doing it for him\" or whatever.\n\nYou need to understand that in the eyes of your children, the new gf and her kid are nothing more than strangers they'll have to tolerate and learn to deal with whether they like it or not, that the situation was imposed on them and they have little to no control on what dad will decide at the end of the day. It seriously sucks to have to deal with that type of change as a teen, especially when dad decides to shove you out of the nest out of the blue to accommodate someone new. Maybe have a real discussion with your family instead of being sneaky? Also, 19y old are not adult, wtf.", "YTA Most college students like to come back to their old bedroom and find it comforting. It's common for kids to move back home for a couple of years after college. You made your girlfriend and her kid seem more important.", "It appears you didn\u2019t discuss this with your son before you made the decision. You were going to do this anyway, but I think your son deserved the courtesy of a heads up before you did this, so I\u2019m going with a mild YTA.  I hope you can smooth things over with him when he comes home on break.", "Originally when he left for college my 16 y.o son begged for his brother's room, but I told him no. All the kids had their own rooms upstairs and I wanted my son to still have a space to come back to.\n\nbut BAM you gave it up for your girlfriend's kid........\n\nYTA \n\nThe only way to accomplish this is to sub-divide your own bedroom to accommodate the bonus kid. You set your children's expectations of you. 13-19 is a little late to change the game plan.", "INFO: What's the age difference between you and the GF? That may well be the root cause of your issue", "YTA, you do not give your children\u2019s rooms away to your girlfriend\u2019s son.", "YTA.", "YTA for not considering how he felt. Why not turn the den into his room? So it\u2019s his space. Then when he moves for good turn it back into a den. He feels pushed out for a gf you\u2019ve had for a year & 1/2. Try to figure out a solution like the one mentioned above or figure out another one.", "Ppl can go back and forth about the house factors but I see it boiling down to this if you didn't discuss moving rooms with your son before you did it you broke his trust, you made him feel less valuable in your life than your girlfriend and her young son, especially after the younger sibling wanted it. There may be added baggage if you get to be more/different of a father figure in the 5yr olds life than your own older kids not to mention the girlfriend factors. Add on the room updates that he wasn't involved in, he'll feel even more like he's out of the loop. Can you really not remember how much everything felt at 19. Right or wrong at a minimum you hurt his feelings and didn't even have the awareness to talk first to see if there could be compromise/resolution just tfb and reddit aita. Smh. Involving him in the den refresh to be more his space might have helped but to think it was not going to affect anything is pretty myopic. Kids at 19 mostly can't communicate those points at least the kids I know.", "YTA for how you did it but not for wanting change.  Hope you\u2019re ready for your \u201cadult\u201d son to boycott coming home all together.  Why would he want to sleep on a sofa bed and share a room with a 5 y/o.  At least you have a new son now!", "YTA. Bro, I\u2019d be hurt if my pops did this ! You\u2019ve only known her for a year? Big mistake imo. I did this with a single woman no kids and regret it. Luckily I have no kids so it wasn\u2019t an issue. I\u2019d never put a woman over me or my \u201cfuture\u201d kids.", "Yta for not talking to your son first before you moved him out. You told him. That isn't talking. Gonna be awhile to make up for that betrayal of trust from you.", "YTA. From your post it seems like he was still regularly using the room at your home and I can understand why he might feel like you're pushing him out. You let him know but it doesn't seem as though you asked his opinion. There could have possibly been a compromise somewhere if you had a proper discussion with him in advance.", "Yta, it's practical I recognise that but he lives temporarily away for college, going from having his own room to a pull out like a guest is a big deal. And you simply let him know instead of considering his opinion before you did this", "YTA, since you glossed over it I'm going to assume you didn't talk to him about the move first, or the redecorating before they happened. Having no control over the situation because you're the boss is one thing, no involvement in discussion or heads up is another. I'd feel like your son too in that he's taken out of the loop.  It could be a bad assumption, tell me I'm wrong?", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your son was coming home regularly, and now you've made it so he can't stay comfortably ever again. All so you can get with a girl almost half your age and 2 years older than your oldest kid.\n\nHope the almost 20-year age gap relationship is worth losing your son over.\n\nEdit: a phrase", "Info: did he actually move out or does he just stay on campus during the school year? If he\u2019s just in campus housing he has to leave during summers and other times of the year and does he have a place to stay now that you\u2019ve made it obvious your house is no longer his home? There\u2019s a big difference between him having private housing that\u2019s his home and staying on campus.\n\nI\u2019m saying YTA until you state he has permanent housing of his own.", "YTA you did push him out and he\u2019ll never trust you again. How does it feel to know you lost your own son to make your gf and her child happy?", "NTA\n\nHe's 19 and out of the house.  That room should to have to sit empty.  Your son still has a place to stay and knows he is welcome.  This is a sometimes painful part of growing up.  He'll get over it.", "Info: if he moves back for the summer again, will you make space for him that is not a pull out couch?", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say NAH. I understand why your son is upset, but he\u2019s only there occasionally. You need to make space for the people who live there all the time. Why should two of the other kids have to share a room, so that your soon has his own room for those times he\u2019s in the house? That room would sit empty the rest of the time. It makes no sense (to me, anyway).", "NTA. A 19-year-old is old enough to recognize that things change when they leave for college.", "Changed to NAH\n\nEssentially he isn't there for most of the year, yeah it sucks he's losing his space and I can totally understand his hurt but it makes sense and unfortunately for him there was always going to need to be some sort of compromise and in my opinion this is the best option.\nYour partner moved in with her son, what did he expect you to do, short of building an extension?\n\nYour options were:\n\n-16 year old and 13 year old share a room, basement is empty most of the year.\n\n-19 year old shares with the 5 year old when he comes back (doubt he'd want that).\n\n-19 year old shares with the 16 year old when he's home (current plan and makes the most sense).\n\nHonestly some parents begin charging rent at 18, would he be willing to pay to keep the basement empty all year?\n\n\nEdit to add:\n\nIs there a way to split the basement into two bedrooms? Then you can put a bed in his section instead of a couch and he can still have 'his space'", "NTA - since when do children (and yes, I mean your 19 yo) get to dictate who gets to live in what room in your home and what gets a makeover or not.  \nIs he paying rent to hold a room in your house?? Of course not.  \nWhere does he want to live in 2 years when college is over? Back to Daddy's rent free, or is he planning on moving on to adult life? He sounds spoiled and I would just tell him that until/unless things change, he is welcome and encouraged to come home while in college and sleep in the den; or find a friend to stay with in town. Don't cave!", ">He ended up living with me for almost all of last summer as he was working nearby and was still dating his high school girlfriend.\n\n>I knew my son was upset about this because the basement has been his space for so long and he still visits home regularly.\n\n>He said some hurtful things about my gf (when he had previously liked her) and told me it felt like I was pushing him out the house for good.\n\nNAH You're not necessarily wrong for giving the room to someone who will use it more but he no longer can comfortably stay at home and work over the summer. You're also basically saying he can't come back after college. He now has to plan on either getting a full time job immediately after graduation (difficult and possibly impossible) or living in your basement den while he looks for work. He knows this is due to your girlfriend's kid and you wanting to help *her* through college so of course he feels resentful that you've chosen them over him.", "NTA-Spoiled entitled kids think this way.", "NTA.  He's old enough to understand that you need to repurpose the space.  It's selfish of him to demand that you keep a whole room reserved just for him to use occasionally, when there's a child living there 24/7 who needs the space.", "NTA - smallest boy gets smallest bedroom.\n\nWhen my daughter left for college her brother was instantly busy moving all his stuff into the bigger room. It's part of the moving up, moving on, moving out process.", "NTA. He\u2019s an adult, he\u2019s away at college, and you provided him with a pull out bed if he needs a place to stay. He\u2019s being childish.", "NAH. It\u2019s your house and your heart is in the right place, but your son feels like he lost his home and he\u2019s hurt.  That\u2019s understandable.  And it\u2019s notable that you weren\u2019t willing to do this change before - because you saw value in your son keeping his bedroom and having a home base.  You started to value that less when your girlfriend and her child came into the picture not that long ago\u2026 Your son is correct that the value you placed on him having a home base changed when she came into the picture.  That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s wrong, but he is technically correct and he\u2019s allowed to feel some sort of way about it.", "NTA. The 19 yr old is out of the house, yeah he might come back and visit regularly but it doesn\u2019t mean everyone else\u2019s life stops in the mean time, plus he\u2019s also an adult now anyway, he should realise how lucky he was that you went to so much effort in the first place to provide him with his own space. I think the main thing that yeah this 19YO (who already moved out) is saying he feels displaced? I can guarantee you that the 5YO feels farrrrrr more displaced and probably confused. I think it\u2019s probably super important for you and your partner to make sure he feels like he has his own secure space right now. Talk to the 19YO about that, and if he still feels his needs outweigh everyone else\u2019s then it\u2019s clear you\u2019ve done all you can and he\u2019s just being selfish at that point.", "NTA", "NAH-\n Son is obviously hurt, sounds like family is super close, and he spends a lot of time at home, and you didn\u2019t let him know until after the fact. You\u2019re doing what you feel is the right move, but he feels displaced, even if he\u2019s in college and growing up that\u2019s his safe place, and he feels like it\u2019s gone. I recommend taking your son out to eat alone, and try to work on these feelings, and make sure the other kids are on the same page. Whether you like it or not you\u2019ve changed everyone\u2019s living situation, and people are going to feel displaced even if that wasn\u2019t the goal. You\u2019ve moved in 2 new people. One of whom is only 5 YO, and he\u2019s going to be a challenge for the older kids to get used to, and one of them has lost their room to him, so there\u2019s going to be resentment whether you like it, or feel it\u2019s appropriate. No assholes, but you\u2019ve got a challenge ahead of you, and you need to start talking to your kids before you make moves that might make them feel displaced. While your son is in college and becoming an adult, college is temporary, and until he has his ducks in a row, that\u2019s still his home, and he\u2019s lost his safe space and privacy.

Doesn't make sense to have an empty bedroom most of the year. Who cares if you said no to the 16yr old this year. You would have a much bigger problem if you put that 5yr old in the room with a teenager", "NTA, this literally happened to me lol. My room went to my step siblings when I moved out for college. It sucks cause there is a feeling of your safe place going away. The end of childhood. But you just gotta deal with it as an adult.", "YTA.  Your son is only 19.  Yes, he\u2019s at college, but your house is still his home, his safe harbor, where he comes for the summer and extended breaks.  His bedroom symbolizes that.  You\u2019ve essentially kicked him out, in his mind.  He no longer has a room there, so it\u2019s not his home, he\u2019s sleeping on a couch, so he\u2019s \u201cjust a guest\u201d.  He will not feel comfortable or welcome on extended visits anymore.  If you had waited until he graduated college, gotten his first real job, my judgement would be different, but he\u2019s still a kid.  I feel sad for him, because I am positive he\u2019s hurting from this.  He insulted your GF because he\u2019s lashing out at the person he perceives is the cause of him being displaced, but soon enough he\u2019ll recognize that the blame is all yours, and it will be a rift in your relationship.  Good luck, OP.  Not sure how you are going to fix this with him.  (FWIW, I have a son the same age so I do have some idea how they think and how much they value \u201chome\u201d).", "Yeah, this is the problem. The 19 yr old is at school and doesn't have a permanent home. He thought of dad's as his home. Most kids spend some time after college at home trying to land a good job or saving enough to be able to find a place to live. He no longer has the option. He can't spend 3-6 months in the basement in everyone's way w/ no privacy. If he were  22, out of school and had a job, it wouod be a completely different story, but offically, the 19 yr old is still living w/ OP and OP's home is his home and primary residence.\n\nOP could have had an adult conversation w/ his son and worked through other possible solutions w/ him before finalizing any plans and moving the GF in. \n\nIn addition, OP has only been dating her a year and a half. Moving families in together at this point is really an aggressive timeline and it sounds like the decision was made partially due to financial reasons, which is never a good reason to make this level of change that will have such a huge impact on so many lives.", "He''s away at school - he should be thrilled he has a place to crash when he is back in town.\n\nAs to the others, life in general is ever changing; nothing stays the same. If you don't teach your kids at a young age how to handle change and disappointments you are doing them a disservice.", "Agree with this, YTA, the 19 yr old didn\u2019t move out he\u2019s away at school. He\u2019s still coming home for breaks and summers. OP said he wanted him to have his own space now he\u2019s relegated to a pull out couch. Plus a lot of kids need to move back after college so this kid is currently in limbo.

Neither son had any issues coming home and sleeping on the couch for a weekend.  \nThis 19 year old spoiled boy needs to grow up!", "OP did let the son know in advance", "Why does a 19 year old's opinion matter here?

Which isn't a great way to start blending a family for the ones who are there every day.\n\nAnd we have no idea when the last time OP painted the bedrooms or upgraded furniture. For all we know, 14f still had a princess palace from when she was 4. Or maybe the rooms had the same paint from when it was originally done for each child, or had holes in the walls from old posters and artwork. In which case it was time for a refresh, 'fair' or not. Because things wear out, including paint, and furniture wears out or gets outgrown.\n\nI'm sure 27 could care less about the younger sibs getting new things at this point. He's got his own place and his own paint and his own furniture that he picked out. This is 19 not transitioning well and not expressing that well.", "Well put! Best take here.\nI would go so far as to say a soft YTA.", "Right, there\u2019s a difference. I lived on/near campus for college but at least a third of my clothing/belongings were in my bedroom at home.", "He commented he\u2019s 44 and gf is 29", "I don't even think he needs to divide his own bedroom. He says he put a pull out in the basements den. So make the den a bedroom!", "IMO, you can't be that self-centered and selfish to say \"divide their bedroom\", because the 19 year old wants his own bedroom for 60-80days of the year, when there's +1 kid who lives home full time and needs his own place, and yes he can sleep on the couch if he's home temporary or can go to his GF place maybe?", "Oh come on. You seriously expect a romantically involved and most likely sexually active couple to share a bedroom with a 5 YEAR OLD??? It's OP's house and he's under no obligation to keep the basement a shrine for a grown adult who's only there 2 months out of the year. A pull out couch won't kill 19 and if he doesn't like it he can find some buddies to crash with.", "A 5 year old needs more privacy than a 19 year old? Lmao", "I don't get why he doesn't make the den into another bed room.", "I have 3 kids living at home still. My 16 yo and 13 yo sons and my 14 yo daughter.", "are you the girlfriend?", "There\u2019s a daughter too; two sons and a daughter at home full time, and 19yo son at college.", "I have 3 kids living at home still.

Not because she needs the money, or you can't help.  But because fathers need to be made to be responsible for their children.\n\nLetting him off the hook because you can provide for his kid, only makes him more likely to make more kids.", "I honestly do not understand this Redditor hive mind view that \u201cyoung adults must have their own bedrooms, anything less than that is child abuse\u201d. It\u2019s wild to me. This kid is old enough to have his own place. And, if we took the girlfriend out of the equation, would they expect him to hang around in an empty five bed house once the kids have left because they *may* need to stay in a bedroom that is totally theirs one day?? No. \n\nWhich leads me to believe that it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s accommodating his girlfriend that is the issue for these commenters. Which is, unsurprisingly, another thing that the Reddit hive mind jumps on - stepfamilies are awful and single parents are not allowed to ever have a relationship again if their adult kids have the slightest problem with it. The man is living his life and being very reasonable, his kids need to adapt. This is such a weird place sometimes \ud83d\ude04", "Exactly there's absolutely no reason for the son to ever come back again.", "Not sure if your mistaken but there is no \"space\" for the 19 year old.", "He can do what SO many other college students do: get some roommates and rent an apartment.", "That's what I don't get. There's a *den* in the basement??? So make it into a bedroom!", "Yes, a pull out couch is fine.", "Terminally online take", "Lol what are you on about? Bad take.", "Op says the 19yo moved down when his brother moved out. Now, that could certainly be when the 27 went to college. It could also mean when the 27yo graduated and fully moved out.", "My daughter lived on campus her first 2 years of college and she had to completely move out each summer and she was home for all her breaks.  I didn't 'take' her room until she got her own apartment and she took most of her bedroom furniture.  Some schools shut their dorms down during winter break as well.  You have no furniture of your own. I can't imagine doing this to any of my children.", "Ah so you\u2019re doing this so your hot young girlfriend stays happy with you. Hope she\u2019s worth the detriment to your relationship with your children.", "And there it is!! Try dating someone your own age.", "Not relevant. Lol. Missing Missing Reasons.", "NTA but guaranteed this has more to do with your gf being your oldest kids age than it has to do with the room itself", "The 16 year old has an entire basement suite, I don't understand why the 16 year old and the 19 year old can't just share for the period that the 19 year old is at home over the summers.", "a 19 year old who doesn't live there and only visits, yeah", "The 19 year old has the means and ability to take care of themselves, the 5 year old does not.  I can see why the 19 year old doesn't like it, but his families reality has changed.  He's not there 24/7, and the space he partially uses needs to be used by someone that genuinely needs it.", "That explains it, didn\u2019t want to give 16yo the basement that belonged to his son until he got himself a hot young piece of ass smh. YTA", "Wait wait I must\u2019ve missed this.  Two years older than his oldest kid?  So his gf is 29?\n\nEdit: yup checked his comment history.  Ew.", "Noooo.  You have four kids living at home.

Be a father before your are someone's boyfriend", "Untill your 19 year old finishes college/University he still lives at home legally. \n\nMy daughter went away to university and when she graduated and decided to stay in the city she studied in with her partner, that is when her bedroom at home became the spare room.\n\nThough it is now known as the spare room it will always be her room if she needs it or when she comes home to visit. She knows that if life turned to shit and she was in a tricky situation, there would always be a place for her to stay and live for however long she needs it. You don't stop parenting when your child becomes an adult, it's a life long commitment. \n\nI know life is fluid and situations change but I'd be mortified if my daughter felt she had no place in our family home.", "My bad - should have read this more carefully. Soz.", "So you don\u2019t consider your son \u201cliving in your home\u201d then what is his permanent address?", "I missed the daughter!  Thanks for clarifying.  Would it be possible for you to renovate the basement so it is a true space for two?", "Exactly there's no reason for him to even visit op", "Second oldest, there's another son that moved out previously.", "Yup. It just sounds like this whole thing was really poorly thought out and OP wasn't really thinking about what was best for his family (or even his GF's kids, really) only what was best for his GF.", "Worth mentioning that for some families, that\u2019s the same thing. In all effect, I \u201cmoved out\u201d at 17 to go to university. My parents invited me to come visit one holiday a year (I went to University in a different country), so I went to their house for Christmas and slept in the guest room. When I was there, they called it polkadots\u2019 room. \nI realise not all families do this, and that\u2019s it\u2019s fairly common practise for graduates to live with their parents, but it\u2019s still a perspective worth mentioning.", "My eldest didn't go to college and he moved out a few weeks after graduating high school.", "My sister moved home after college to attend law school near our family home. She moved into my room with me for the summer, then I left for college (dorm life), and the room became hers. My parents bought her a new bed. She was 22 and didn't want bunk beds. I get it. On breaks when my brother was also home from college, he slept in his room, my sister slept in her room (my old room), and I slept on the couch. Never once felt like I was being pushed out.", "Not true, most people do get that. I don't know anyone whose parents got rid of their bedroom when they went to college. Where are they supposed to spend summer breaks?", "Right?  Turn the den into a second basement bedroom.  He has enough space, he just actually has to put some effort into it.", "Going to college is not moving out, it\u2019s still his primary residence. Breaks happen, school will end, these are OP\u2019s own words when explaining to his 16 year old why he couldn\u2019t have the basement originally.. now he\u2019s got this super young GF that\u2019s the same age as his kid and he\u2019s bending over backwards for her 5 year old\u2026 and you\u2019re cool with that? Lmao ok", "Which is all the more reason a 5 year old does not need a a dedicated space of their own that they can\u2019t take care of\u2026 the 19 year old is in school, going to college isn\u2019t moving out as he still comes home for breaks and will need somewhere to live once he graduates\u2026 ask yourself why OP was so adamant about these facts when it came to the 16 year old wanting the basement originally \u201cmy 19 year old needs a space of his own\u201d and suddenly flips when his super young GF that\u2019s his kids age comes around\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t do it for his own 16 year old son but he did it for this 5 year old he\u2019s known a year to make his hot new piece happy", "Oh, didn't you get the memo? This is AITA. Everyone here is from the USA, and you stop prioritizing your children as soon as they turn 18.", "Would you be this baffled if OP decided to downsize after the kids left?

It's just a bedroom, a bathroom, and a small den. I'm not really looking to renovate the rest of the basement but the den is somewhat private.", "I totally agree. My brother moved out junior year.  He had summer internships and stayed where he was.  He also rented an apartment off campus.\n\nOn the other hand, I never lived off campus and ended up moving home to work in town after college.\n\nIt sounds like the son comes home for the entire summer and works.\n\nThe way he worded it though, makes think the 27yo kept his room through all of college.", "OK, so he totally moved out. Completely different from moving into a dorm for the school year.  The 19yo's permanent address is the house.  You have a den in the basement.  Why not make it into another bedroom?", "Is your current gf his ex?", "You must live in a very privileged clique because in the US it is common to pay rent or lose your room.", "My dad moved after I went to college, I just slept in a guest bedroom when I was on break. I never felt unwelcome. \n\nI also spent most of my breaks except Christmas still on campus working, though (living in apartments). I had assumed that was pretty common but apparently it's not judging by the comments in these kinds of posts.", "So he's dating someone that's his kids age?", "It\u2019s weird", "His oldest is 27", "Because op is being an asshole about how his kid is reacting acting like it came out of nowhere.", "This lol. It\u2019s the dad\u2019s home that he is paying for. He gets to decide. His oldest son isn\u2019t even there most of the time. Summer break from school is what, 2.5 months long? So he\u2019s there most of (but not necessarily all of) that time, and not the other time, with the exception of winter break probably. He doesn\u2019t need an entire basement room that he isn\u2019t even using the majority of the year. Ultimately, the person who is paying for the living space gets to make the choices. Someone who is barely there and pays for nothing isn\u2019t entitled to a consultation of what should be done with the living space. He wants his gf to move in, he gets to decide that since he\u2019s paying. Gf has a small child. A small child who will be there all the time needs a space and needs to be near their mom, so needs to be upstairs close to her. A 16 year old who is there all the time and needs a bit more privacy due to age needs probably a  larger space since he\u2019s an older and larger person, preferably one away from dad and dad\u2019s gf. A 19 year old who technically doesn\u2019t even need to stay at the house (could stay in the college town and work there in the summer or take summer classes) but is there max 3 months a year (taking Xmas break into consideration) does not need their own large space, and can share when they are there, especially if he\u2019s working / hanging with gf during the summer and not really spending much time in the room.", "Where does he state his or gfs age?", "Sounds like you are speaking from the standpoint of someone who has not raised children, but has gone through a similar experience as the 19 year old.  I have, finishing my last two mostly grown humans now.  My 22 year old daughter lives with us while she finishes college remotely, and my 17 year old has a year left.\n\nThe 19 year old has a space.  It's not perfect, but it's not terrible.  He doesn't live there full-time, and is for all intents and purposes, an adult that's responsible for himself.  I do disagree that the 16 year old should have had the space earlier, but not knowing the dynamics of the house, I understand.\nAs for the \"super young gf\", that doesn't matter one bit.  It is literally Op's house.  He can legally do whatever he wants.  If the 19 year old is that salty over it, he can legally get his own place.  If he needs privacy, he can work something out with his 16 year old brother.  I've seen that happen, I've been part of that sort of thing with my own siblings.  The 19 year old kid has options.  The 5 year old does not.", "Yeah i always forget that they are from the US and things like that are literally normalized there.", "How about OP first talk to his son and explain to him the situation and maybe ask him if he is fine with that? It\u2019s still HIS room and OP just put everything aside for a little boy that he doesn\u2019t even know yet. \n\nLegally adult means nothing, but you still think that. maybe don\u2019t have children if you would treat your children differently the minute they become 18.", "You made over all the rooms, but didn\u2019t even consider turning the den into a true bedroom? You\u2019re really showing your son you don\u2019t value him having a place in your home.  Renovating the basement seems like a small price to pay so your son feels welcome and continues to visit. Would you want to visit regularly if you lost your room and had a pullout couch in a small den with no door? I would be heartbroken if I was your son.", "So you renovated every other room to make it more fair for your younger kids, but won't renovate the rest of the basement so your son in college has a room too? YTA", "Info: why do you dislike your son so much? What did he do to you? Why are you putting your gf over your son? Your 29 years old gf who is only 2 YEARS younger than your oldest son and are only together for 1,5 year. You are putting her and her son who you don\u2019t really know over your son. Father of the year i guess. What else will she get? Maybe your daughters room as a wardrobe? Or your other son\u2019s room when you have a child with her?", "Because all the kids use that space to play video games and watch TV. When my son is home from college it can be turned into a bedroom (hence the couch) and they can use the TV in the living room or be in their bedrooms. It doesn't need to be a permanent bedroom.", "Okay but most dorms at most unis in the States don\u2019t let you keep your dorm during holidays at all unless you\u2019re taking classes, I thought? Did that change over COVID?", "For college students to pay rent or lose their room at their parents? I get that it's different for non-college bound 18yos, but that seems like a below average level of privilege for college students to me. That only happens if the family is on a tight budget and rely on the oldest kids' income to make the family budget work. That type of scarcity mindset seems inappropriate in this situation, given that OP has a 5 bedroom house and hasn't mentioned any financial strain for paying college tuition or anything like that. \n\nContinuing to maintain your previous standard of living at your parents house while you dorm most of the year at college seems like a normal level of privilege to have, especially if your parents can afford it.", "He is, but it isn't like he was a grown ass adult when he had the kid.", "It's fine.

It\u2019s an asshole move to do to your 19 year old no matter how you slice it\u2026 no he didn\u2019t commit a criminal offense against his son but given the circumstances it\u2019s a dick move period. He has no responsibility to this 5 year old that he has known for a year, certainly nothing even in the same universe as his 19 year old son.

No one's parents charged rent for that, nor forced them to move or share with younger siblings.\n\nThat said, many of my friends' rooms were slowly overtaken by their parents' things like office supplies, gym equipment, clothes, etc. But they still got to sleep in their own rooms and  privacy that they were used to in high school.

It might seem practical, but it would be very bad for family dynamics.", "Is it common for students to stay in dorms after their freshman year where you went? Where I went to school people only did freshman year in dorms because they had to, and very few stayed in them after that.
