This has created a huge amount of family drama and I would like to know if I am the AH here.\n\nMy sister and I share a mother, but not a dad. My dad abandoned me when I was a baby. Her dad has been in my life since I was about 6 years old, he had two more children with our mother who are both older than her. \n\nUnfortunately, our mother passed away tragically when my half siblings were 9 & 6 respectively and my sister was 3. I was an older teen at the time.\n\nOur mother was horribly abusive to me, going as far as physically hurting me and encouraging her boyfriends to do so to the point of me receiving hospital care and moving in with a relative at the age of 16 shortly before her death. At the time of her death, she and her husband at the time had been charged with child abuse and had been awaiting trial for removal of her remaining children.\n\nMy younger siblings\u2019 father, not married to our mother at this time, was still deeply in love with our mother and while he knew of her abuse of me, never spoke of her poorly to my siblings. Now that we are all adults, they have been told the whole story, but obviously still love and miss their mom and remember her in a positive light. \n\nThe older one of my half brothers (59) respects my trauma and has some recollection of our mother\u2019s true self and is private about his love for her, my younger two siblings are not. My younger brother (56) really loves to look through the photo albums and keeps an archive of pictures about our mother online, but he rarely adds captions other than date or details about the photos of known.\n\nMy sister on the other hand posts pictures of our mother frequently and often calls her an amazing mother, an inspiration, basically worshipping a woman she never knew and knows traumatized me deeply. I have spoken to her about this, but she sees nothing wrong with the situation so I have decided to quietly unfollow her on social media. I have not blocked her or stopped responding to messages, I would just prefer to not see the posts about our mother.\n\nUnfortunately, she has noticed and it has started major drama in my family. My siblings are split down the middle on who is at fault, but I am worried I am being the AH here.\nShe is making it seem as if I am not allowing her to love and miss her mom and trying to spoil her good memories of her. My brother is telling me to just let it go and follow her again, but I do not want to.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690557418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15c0arp/aita_for_unfollowing_my_sister_on_social_media/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's perfectly reasonable for the things that your sister's posting to upset you, and you don't have to keep following her if it's detrimental to your mental health and wellbeing. You made the right choice.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk her if she would prefer you commenting your view instead.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr just refuse to discuss it.", "NTA \n\nYou are free to follow and unfollow whoever you want. Clearly what your sister was posting was triggering to you which is very understandable. If she is not giving you happiness then you don\u2019t need to follow her. I have also unfollowed family members on social media for posting very toxic things (because they are also very toxic people).\n\nAlso her causing family drama because you unfollowed her is proving your point as to part of the reason why you unfollowed her. She seems like she enjoys drama, maybe distance yourself from her. Take care of yourself too, try to heal the best you can. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nEven if your reason for unfollowing wasn't good (it's a very good reason), you don't owe anyone a follow.", "NTA and why is she so psycho over just a follow on something. She has bigger issues honestly.", "NTA.  She's being ridiculous (claiming you're not letting her love and miss her mom) over something even more ridiculous (an unfollow on social media).  She's the asshole.\n\nAnyone siding with her and telling you to follow her again is also an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nYou can be social with whomever you want on social media.\n\nFor solidarity: I have unfriended my entire family on Facebook. Not only were they posting racist and homophobic content, but they were also OBSESSED with using it to hurt each other. They'd post passive aggressive memes, or write about being hurt but \"not naming names,\" etc., resulting in my aunts, uncles, and cousins constantly calling each other to ask \"what did person x mean on FB?? Were they calling me out?? I can't believe they'd post that!\" I drew a line when some uncle 100% made up a story that I posted that my husband had left me, and I had to field a bunch of phonecalls about a total fabrication. It was borderline harassment.\n\nIt's completely healthy to put up a boundary and not engage with this stuff. Participating in drama is not love. I noticed your age, and definitely have found that your generation, in particular, seems the most offended when someone closes that window. They have somehow grown to believe this is a necessary form of communication, no matter how destructive, and it simply isn't.\n\nGood job preserving your mental health.", "NTA.\n\nYou've set a boundary that is healthy for you, and that's none of her business.  You need healing, not to be continually emotionally afflicted by someone who traumatized you.\n\nUnfortunately, one option, is that when someone brings this to you and causes drama, you might need to just say of your mother \"she was my abuser, so it's PTSD for me to have someone who didn't even know her continually post positive things about her, I really don't need to explain myself...\" \n\nIn reality - though - you \"don't\" need to explain yourself.  We all \"unfollow\" people.  How does she even know and it seems like she's trying to punish you...  Why would she even care?\n\nHugs and take care, you haven't done anything wrong.  Keep your boundaries in place and heal.", "NTA you aren't stopping your sister from doing anything, you just don't want to see it, for valid reasons. I think you're handling it in a mature way.   \n\n\nYour sister, on the other hand, is being an immature AH insisting that you follow her accounts, when did social media follows become mandatory?   \n\n\nYou are not obliged at all to do this, I think you are justified in your decision to unfollow. But if you want to stop the major family drama from continuing you could follow but mute/snooze her posts on the major platforms, so you still don't have to see the posts.", "NTA\n\nTheres a world where you could just ignore it but I completely support your decision. Its like unfollowing an ex when they start posting pictures with a new partner. Just hurts to see it.", "NTA. Either your sister is incredibly insensitive and tone deaf, or she doesn\u2019t care about you or your feelings at all. Ask her which one it is and watch her squirm."]}
