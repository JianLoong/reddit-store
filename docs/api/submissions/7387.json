Install a night light, get her one of those machines that generates soothing sounds.  Get her some headphones preprogrammed with Disney music so she doesn't hear the 'quiet'.

My husband and I are horror fanatics but I will not let my kids watch what we watch unless it's kid appropriate. That movie is way too scary for a child. I was even scared!

HOWEVER YTA for letting her watch a wildly inappropriate movie in the first place.     That movie is terrifying.   I watched it when it came out and haven\u2019t been able to watch any horror movie since.", "YTA. Your daughter is too old to be regularly sharing a bed with her parents. She needs to be able to self-soothe, how's she going to cope if she goes to a sleepover or to camp? If she can't sleep on her own at this point then you should talk to her paediatrician about it, because just letting her sleep with you is not going to help her process her fear from the film you showed her (which you are also the AH for). You can't try and assuage your guilt over scaring your child by opening your marital bed to her indefinitely.", "ESH - no way she should have watched that, she's far too young. You can never unsee something which is why you have to be so careful with kids & horror especially. For that you're a mahoosive arsehole. Just massive! SO BIG! You just created a horrible horrible core memory for her & you can't undo it. \n\nNTA for knowing she needed not to be alone for the night (& maybe many more!).

You need to monitor what she watches and not show her crazy movies like that.", "NTA for allowing your daughter to sleep in your bed but YTA x1000 for letting her watch Insidious.

I\u2019m not buying a 10 year old is traumatized that badly for that long afterwards.  She likes being in your bed and is using the movie as an excuse and playing you with tears.  Your wife knows it.  And everyone is wondering about you.  She\u2019s too old to be sleeping with Daddy.", "Going against the grain but NAH\n\nFor those basing their vote mainly on the fact that OP let his daughter watch Insidious in the first place: just because it\u2019s a PG-13 horror movie doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s automatically going to be scary for a 10 year old, while a PG movie could still scare the crap out of one. Take it from someone first exposed to the genre at a way younger age than OP\u2019s  daughter, it can be very hit or miss. OP, you\u2019re not in the wrong for showing it to her.\n\nThat being said, your wife isn\u2019t wrong in wanting your daughter to sleep in her own room despite her fears. As painful as making her sleep alone while she\u2019s going through this is, it\u2019s going to take a much longer time for her to overcome her fears without at some point facing them on her own. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t things you can do in the meantime to try and ease her mind.\n\nWhen I was a little younger than your daughter, I watched The Mummy for the first time. I had seen wayyyy scarier movies by then, but for some reason the scene with the decomposing undead mummy trying to kiss Rachel Weisz\u2019s character just really freaked me out and gave me nightmares for weeks. The way I got over them though was I remembered that in the movie, the mummy freaked out and ran at the sight of a cat. So I put a jingly little cat stuffed animal I had right next to the door to my room to scare off any mummy that tried to do the same to me. I got over my nightmares pretty quick after that and The Mummy is one of my favorite movies now. Maybe try a similar approach with your daughter (and wait a while to see if she ends up warming up to the genre before trying to show her the Insidious sequel).", "Kinda AH you let her watch it I want to say otherwise because I watched a on of horror when I was her age and younger (tales of the crypt for example with family) yeah I got scared but I handled it better and that's just a person to person thing.\n\nYou are NTA for making sure she isn't scared and alone, movies wasn't what got me scared but if u left her to her own fears she will become like me afraid of the dark and being alone, I have huge anxiety for it because my grandma locked me alone in a big dark room multiple times alone when I came over, other times as punishment I'd cry for someone and she just left me.\n\nSo ty for not letting that fear build up but you should find alternatives to help her through it", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What matters here is that you're caring for your daughters emotional needs, which you are.

Try not to draw too much attention to the sleeping arrangements, keep chilled about it in front of her. Perhaps sleep on the floor in her room for a few nights, try and wean her off it. She\u2019s old enough to be negotiated with.", "IMHO, I disagree. I grew up watching horror movies, the first one I remember being the hills have eyes at 4 years old.\n\nThe only horror movies I can't deal with (even at age 23) are the one with clowns, but that's just because I am personally terrified of clowns.\n\nIs insidious terrifying? Yes. Should he be reprimanded for it? No, personally I think this experience is more than enough of a lesson in itself.\n\nAt least it wasn't the last exorcism, or any found footage horror film.", "Nonsense, those rating are more of guidelines and not not-to-be-ever-broken laws of life. If she enjoyed the feelings of watching a horror movie it's fine, if she learned that she's too young to enjoy them or if it's just not her cup of tea it's also fine. \n\nI know several people (myself included) who watched horror movies from a very young age and liked them. If parents tried to stop me, I would watch them in secret anyways. Oh, and I haven't dreamt a single nightmare since kindergarden (exclusing the ones that happen the day before meeting the dentist).\n\nI would only agree with your rating if they forced her to watch it or tried to keep her to stay watching after she showed signa of not liking/enjoying it.\n\nEdit: I am not talking about this particular post and this particular girl. I am talking that we shouldn't ban all horror movies to all kids because some service rated it S and adults are scared of their kids having a nightmare or two. Give the damn gids their damned autonomy damnit.", "I was a scared kid who had an untreated anxiety disorder when I was little. My mom, being the religious woman she was at the time, told me to tell the monsters \"In the name of Jesus, you're not welcome here\" and they'd go away. I stopped believing in Christianity when I was 9, but I'll be damned if I didn't find comfort in muttering that when I'd have a panic attack at 15 and become convinced there were monsters in the corners of my room.\nIt's not about whether or not it's true, it's about giving kids tools to help them learn to regulate and self soothe.", "When I was six, I went to sit in my older sisters room and she and her friend were talking about the movie 'Misery.' Just talking about it, mind you- they were nowhere near daft enough to actually have it on around me. I still had nightmares for the better part of a week. The phrase \"hobbled his leg with an axe\" combined with the image of my sister imaginary swinging is one of those Inside Out core memories. I can't believe this guy.", "Agreeing with your agreement. When I was about 9/10 i watched Room 1408 which was horrifying to me at the time. Watched it ot again the recently, realised it had a PG-13 rating and while it is a classic thriller (and I would genuinely recommend) most of the fear factor comes from the occasional jumpscare. Its not really  a scary movie when your brain is old enough to process whats happening onscreen. Age ratings are there for a reason", "I still remember being at my friend's sleepover birthday party in 1st grade and we watched Child's Play because she got that for her birthday. She was one of those kids who was fine watching horror movies from a young age, I wasn't and had nightmares for literally years. OP is definitely the AH here.", "I was about OP\u2019s kid\u2019s age when I saw a scary show on a kids\u2019 tv channel and I\u2019m still creeped out by wet footprints (like on a bath mat after a shower) 15 years later.", "Isn\u2019t Insidious one of the newer actually terrifying movies? It\u2019s not really my genre but I seem to remember hearing it being praised for one of the best horror movies to date", "I watched it at 10 or something then we had to sleep in a tent\u2026 I did not sleep I was absolutely convinced a velociraptor was going to eat me", "True story. I had nightmares after watching Jurassic Park and I was 20 yes old.", "Oh yeah it is. I've not seen it as I'm a wimp but I know someone who's a horror fan and they told me it's amazing but also very, very scary. How dad thought it was age appropriate for a 10 year old, we'll never know!", "Exactly, not all kids are the same. For some a nightmare or a two are worth the experience of a good horror movie.\n\nI remember when I first watched alien at a ripe age of... 6ish, I was scared as shit and barely slept but then the next day I asked when will we watch the sequel. Now it's one of my favourite movies and as a bonus I stopped having nightmares at a very early age (minus the teeth falling apart ones).", "And my favorite horror movie is Texas Chainsaw Massacre the original doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna let my child watch it?", "Another suggestion about what helped me. After being scared for weeks, I started reading about astral projection in blogs. If you find appropriate ones for her age they may help. I was afraid of falling asleep before that.", "That's why my sister did with my niece when she was terrified after seeing Jaws. Went on YouTube and showed her a behind the scenes making of the shark.", "It was a lawyer! Ive watched that series wayyyyy too many times.", "I think my kids are twisted, when they saw that scene they laughed.", "A sleepover in her room could go a long way into making it a safe place for her again. Make it fun. Popcorn party and a movie more age-appropriate (it\u2019s not so much AGE, it\u2019s individual sensitivity. She\u2019s clearly more sensitive than you anticipated. Go for Pixar or something)\n\nAsk mom to pop in and join the sleepover too. At least for the party if not the full nights sleep. It would be good for y\u2019all to be United in trying to make her feel at home and comfortable alone in her room again. Y\u2019all can have sleeping bags instead of blankets, do some silly stuff and draw funny character art from your movie - whatever her fave things are. Make it like a mini party. Take hair ties and make your hair funny \u201cmakeover\u201d style. Do something ridiculous and laugh with her - in her room!\n\nProb be good for you and wife, too, have some fun goofy time. Pillow fight? Snacks you don\u2019t usually eat so late is a sure fire delight for a kiddo her age. Y\u2019all just cuddle up when she gets sleepy, see how it goes\u2026 try to tiptoe out of the room when she sleeps. Rinse and repeat of necessary, come back in if she wakes up afraid. \n\nTake the time, she might not even be so scared of the actual movie, but is trying without knowing how to articulate, that she needs attention and trust from her folks. Give her some extra for a bit.", "Omg same the ring scared me at 15 when it was cool to watch scary movies", "Exactly this. The Wizard of Oz is rated G, but plenty of kids have been scarred for life by the flying monkeys. I was one of them lol", "In all fairness, the raptors back when we were young, they didn\u2019t portray any of the raptors as having an emotional bond\u2026they just chased you and ripped you to shreds.", "I hope you\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s a parents job to say \u201cno\u201d sometimes.", "I still don\u2019t watch scary movies as an adult, I couldn\u2019t get past the intro of Edward Scissor hands for years as a kid. Maybe 9ish, it absolutely terrified me! That\u2019s how bad it was. Just the mom walking in the attic and him walking out of the shadows, I was done. Took me many years to actually watch past that part and get to the interesting part of the movie. My sister on the other hand who was 5 years younger would watch anything and everything sitting on my moms lap. Nothing phased her."]}
