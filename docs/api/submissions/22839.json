I was using social media as a tool to be OUTSIDE of what felt like a permanent indoor sentence not realizing that it wasn\u2019t really making me feel any better, just numbing me to real life and my internal clock that would typically say \u201cok I think you\u2019ve been on the phone long enough\u201d just stopped working \n\nAre you guys going on dates? \nIs she feeling depression/anxiety?\nDoes she have outings with her girl friends?\nDoes she have an outlet she can reach whenever needed such as friends or a therapist? \nDoes she have hobbies that she\u2019s able to participate in? \n\nAfter my argument with my partner I realized I was using my phone and social media to literally just escape because I 1.) didn\u2019t have any friends to talk to because I\u2019m the only one with children, & 2.) I never left the house other than for groceries because we were so busy with getting everything just right at home + my partner was working & we just never really did anything which put a grey lens over life and I realized the weight I was putting on him by never having the dishes clean when it was time to cook, only doing laundry when one of us ran out of underwear, really only cooking when he asked which if he was asking he was obviously hungry, which was a pain to have to wait for a meal to cook whereas I should have already had it done before him needing to ask.

Having an outlet and someone to talk to with no judgment helped me see my own faults and where I was trying to fill voids that I wasn\u2019t even aware of.

She maybe depressed, checked out. Like some said she may not be equipped for that lifestyle of a SAHM. You can also see about a part time daycare if you can? And she could get a job on the days the child goes to daycare. Away from the house doing something different etc. do chores together on the weekend make it fun somehow.

So right now she is watching a baby 24/7, cooking and cleaning.  I'm assuming she does the cooking because you said \"No she wasn't she used to be all for wanting to do laundry and and cook for me and just be my light in the darkness.\"\n\nI'm not saying you're not putting a lot of effort into this relationship and family. I am saying that being someone's light in the darkness, a full time mother, and in charge managing a household can lead to burnout. Even just carrying a baby can lead to burnout. You're mad at her for not keeping the apartment tidy enough and think its because she's on social media all day, but it is pretty easy to post something quickly to social media in between tasks. Is your son in clean diapers when you get home? Are there dirty dishes in the sink that sit for days and days? Is there grime on the floor that just never disappears? If you answer no to any of these questions, it means that she has been attentive to her son and cleaning.\n\nYou said that you play with your son from the time you get home until work, and that when you walk in for dinner your wife is on the phone. Is your wife making dinner or are you guys getting takeout? If she made the dinner, then she was doing things that didn't involve her phone and doing things that directly benefit you and your family. Also, you get to play with your son, but are you waking up with him in the middle of the night? Are you changing his diaper or helping potty train? Who is the one who deals with meltdowns and temper-tantrums throughout the day?? If it isnt you, its your wife. It is easy to notice the things she does not do, but it is hard to notice the things she does. It's not malicious, its human.\n\nListen, I'm not trying to attack you. It is really nice to hear that you care about your son and your family, and I don't doubt your work is very tiring and difficult. I am saying though that it is easy to miss all the things your wife does, and that in general the difficulty of managing a household is severely underplayed.\n\nEdit to add:  I think it's a great idea to have family outings on Sundays. I also think itd be a good idea to have more one on one time with your son, maybe take him to parks or kiddie pools or something, so you can have more time to bond with him when he's so young and your wife gets some time dedicated to relaxing and not having to worry about anything. Even if your wife isn't burntout, its a good way to prevent burnout before it happens.

I stopped taking care of myself, stopped having friends and stopped really caring about my husband (now ex husband) and he didn\u2019t see that I was depressed at all. I still CARED about him, but I didn\u2019t want to interact with him at all. He saw that I was still cleaning, cooking and interacting with the kids when I was home and that when they went to bed I made the choice to ignore him, which I did I guess.  \n\nDepression is horrible and it can ruin relationships if the couple doesn\u2019t notice the signs of it and do something to fix it.", "I thought I wanted to be a SAHM until I actually became one and I was lousy at it.  I became depressed and had no feeling of accomplishment.  I truly didn\u2019t see that coming.", "Being a sahm may not be the best role for her but uh too fucking bad?  If that's what she is, then that's what she is and she has to step up.  Plain and simple.  You're a parent, a wife and you have big girl responsibilities.  Step. TF. Up.  Figure out a long-term solution in the meantime.", "Yea sure, but that\u2019s part of being a couple you split responsibilities. If both work, you split chores. If he is bringing in ALL the money and covering ALL the bills, she is responsible for ALL the chores. He\u2019s holding up his end of the bargain. She is not.", "Yes, just like her husband is going to work every day and putting food on the table. At the bare minimum she should\u2019ve stopped her kid from playing with a literal blade, but she couldn\u2019t even manage that. They both have stressful roles and she isn\u2019t doing her part.", "loser.", "Suck the energy or cause anxiety. I developed an anxiety disorder. Stayed home to raise my 3 kids and just getting back to work. I love it! I love my kids but it was tough feeling like the house was never clean enough, the dishes endless, you put it off and nothing matters you can clean it another day and its a mess again. Over and over and over. I love my kids. They are \u201cmy people\u201d but Im fully loving the fact that no one needs daycare and I can afford to work.", "Depression was my immediate thought too.", "Same. You\u2019re certainly not alone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to tell others, to help them feel less guilty about admitting it. And, lousy is up for interpretation. I bet you were, at the very least, fairly decent, but trying to uphold the image of social media moms can make us feel so much worse.", "Really? Down votes? I work >> 60 hours a week and my SAHW/M is crazy busy raising the kids. Just because I punch a clock doesn't mean we aren't a team. I cook 4 days a week and do all the shopping...and more. We've been married 28 years with some of our kids still in school. Shit happens. Suck it up and work to be better together next time.  Little kindnesses go a long way. Down voting that is a mirror for your own reflection.", "Way to have some empathy. Perhaps her mental health needs attention, and \u201cpick yourself up by the bootstrap\u201d mentality doesn\u2019t quite apply to that. Getting help from a medical professional, putting the baby in daycare, and getting a job are far more reasonable suggestions than suck it up. \n\nMay you never know the struggle with mental health issues. It can be absolute hell. Especially when the people around you invalidate mental health issues.", "And if dude was staying home from work or not performing at work, his mental health would be questioned as well. \n\nSorry; there\u2019s no gotcha here. Just the usual pretend switching-the-genders outrage used to discredit women while pretending this sub is \u201csexist\u201d toward men.", "Your post resonates with me a lot.\n\nIf she has post-partum depression and is extremely burnt out (which sounds like the case, especially with how little she reacted to the blade on the floor) you are not going to be able to fix it yourself. She needs professional help. I personally went through a severe depressive episode and burn out last year and my husband also felt like he should be able to make it better.While I love him and understand the sentiment behind it, I needed professional help via psychiatry and therapy. He was not the source of my depression/burn out, just as you most likely are not the source of your wife's depression/burn out.\n\nThe best thing you can do is support her and get her help. I saw in another comment you said yall are meeting tomorrow to eat and you're hoping to talk then. I hope it goes well, but don't be surprised if she doesn't want to go in-depth about such heavy emotions in a public setting. Also it can help to call/make appointments for her with her next to you but that way she doesn't have to face the anxiety of being the one to talk and admit what she's going through. That was the hardest part for me, and it seems like she may not be wanting to admit what she's really feeling based on your previous info given.\n\nHer likely depression/burn out is something bigger than either of yall can fix on your own (its not something that will get fixed in a matter of days or weeks), and I truly hope you are able to have a constructive discussion and get her the help she needs.", "I agree. This is cause for immediate intervention.", "NTA. You said are you being harsh but I don\u2019t see how so and plus you child could have been very hurt and she just said oh\u2026 like sorry but she\u2019s just not it", "She on her phone flirting with\nGuys about how u never home", "Saddest part she gonna take more than half in divorce after u catch her with another man", "You're not the asshole, and it's also possible your wife is very depressed. She might need help.", "ESH. Your wife is clearly struggling in some way and needs help or intervention, and you suck for not looking below the surface to see that. She sucks for putting the child at risk with a blade even though she\u2019s ill. (Having been like this myself before, there IS a line and random loose blades is it.) Sounds like you guys need a bit of therapy and some stronger lines of communication. Good luck.", "NTA being a sahm is a job and requires work and effort", "NTA.\n\nShe needs to get off the couch and pull her weight. You're working 12 hour days and paying the bills. She needs to be more observant and not leave blades on the floor. And she needs to work on the house. That responsibility should not fall on you.\n\nI see \"leave him!!!\" Or \"girl, run,\" comments all the time on posts where men do what your lady is doing.\n\nI for one believe people throw away relationships too easily which results in lost opportunity to really grow as a people.\n\nThat being said, it would be hard to blame you if you did.", "NTA in the slightest. These are red flags presenting itself already. If she can\u2019t do the basic job of SAHM while you work all day to provide finances then what is she doing? I wouldn\u2019t stand for it at all personally. Be firm with her and let her know it cannot continue or you\u2019ll have to consider your future together. Trust me , it only gets worse from here if you don\u2019t nip it in the bud now. Obviously I\u2019m assuming this is with your OH being of sound mind. She might be getting some Post natal depression. Is she a lazy personality normally? If not, definitely worth looking into.", "Oh boy. To me it seems she is lonely and addicted to her phone. You being gone all day is probably hard on her mentally. Perhaps she ought to say or do something about it. NTA", "Dude she is 35 done hit the wall. Is the kid even yours? Seriously you can do bad all on your own and don't need added stress. She knows you are not going anywhere and has you by the balls if you try to leave. Your not the A hole here it's 100 percent her.", "Not an asshole and neither is she. I think talking to her with a focus on safety of your kid and on her well being is a good place to start. Regarding the phone usage, I think it\u2019s a lot easier to use our phones to numb ourselves when we are experiencing depression. On th\u00e9 plus side, it\u2019s safer than using alcohol or other substances to numb or distract from our feelings, but no one wants to spend their life that way. If there are things she\u2019s interested in that she hasn\u2019t done in a while, maybe encourage her to do those things in some way, like buying art supplies if she liked to make art. You are the one who works and I completely get the frustration, I\u2019ve been there, but from her side of things she\u2019s just sitting at home as a new mom isolated watching everyone else live their lives. From experience, that lifestyle is SO much more difficult than going to work everyday, even when I work 80 hours a week, because it feels like a dead end and just leads to more depression. If she could feel more connected to her community and her interests, that could give her the energy and desire to do other things. I don\u2019t know what her life was like before having a child, but there\u2019s also a mourning of our old lives that we go through when we transition to new chapters in life.", "O\\_O im sorry! back up! there was a ninja blade on the ground with your toddler around and her response was \"oh I didn't see it\"?! \n\nNTA. I have cut people out of my life that do this to their kids. Just ignore their, scream at them for wanting their parent to interact with them or are glued to their phones. I had to remove myself from those situations or else i was going to explode. You really need to sit down and discuss all of this because this is so far from ok. I know and understand parents need their own down time and stuff. but she is supposed to be a parent first. Her phone does not need more attention than the child. If she cant put the child and chores before her phone, you may have to consider some serious changes.", "NTA.  But you have gotten your warning in no uncertain terms. You need to have a serious conversation with her. Be prepared for the pushback. Also be aware that if you give her an ultimatum, you will have to follow through. If I were you I would prepare an exit plan. You need to either leave her or have a housekeeper or nanny. The next time you come home it might be to a tragedy. A blender blade on the floor is your warning. Best of luck.", "This should be the top comment", "See the problem I have... Long story short, my partner moved to my area, it's an English speaking area in Spain for retirees, I had my reasons for coming here but I am now happy and own my home and work remote. She doesn't speak English and all attempts to get her to learn it fall on empty ears, partly because we can't afford it because of some outstanding debt I had from a previous life.\nAs I said long story short. She doesn't work, mainly because the jobs, even bar work, require you to speak English. But she doesn't do enough around the house and I often find her in bed on her phone.\nThat's demotivating for me as I need to be highly motivated to work from my home office.\nShe gets angry when I tell her x, y and z needs doing and says I know it needs doing you don't need to tell me. OK so why isn't it done then?\n*rant over*", "My first thought about the clothes was \"Do they have a peak energy plan?\" I will not run certain appliances from 4:00 to 7:00 because we get charged extra for energy usage during that time. Clothes can wait a few hours without harm.", "And even if it doesn't get to the point of mold, the clothes will still smell sour and musty. This little boy at my daughter's daycare years ago always wore clothes that reeked like that. You could tell his mom left wet clothes in a washer for a few days. I felt so bad for that poor boy because you could smell him from two feet away.", "I am glad to hear that.  My husband is one of those who tends to martyr until he is fed up, and then he gets angry.  My therapist says this is a form of \"frontloading.\"  This tactic allows someone to feel above the other person.  It prevents an equal footing, which in turn ruins trust.", "Good point.  She should seek the help she needs while she steps tf up at home.  There is no excuse for not noticing your toddler playing with a fucking blender blade.  That is inexcusable negligence.  The second problem to this is that her response was basically \"didn't notice\" while staying glued to her phone.  She doesn't care.  So no, I don't have empathy for someone who has forfeited caring for the safety of their child.", "If the guy was a stay at home dad not a single person would be questioning his mental health.

She is taking complete advantage of you.  I would immediately make different arrangements for the care of your child.  If you don\u2019t, the consequences could be too horrific to even mention.  And if something does happen, God forbid, you could also be held criminally responsible because you KNEW she was neglecting your child and did nothing about it.\n\nTell her to get off her lazy ass and find a job, if she won\u2019t, you have some hard decisions to make.  The safety and well being of that baby comes FIRST, and she cannot be trusted to take care of that.\n\nBest of luck to you and your child!  NTA! Bring a SAHM or dad is hard work, and she\u2019s clearly not capable of it.", "NTA but not in the right, either. I\u2019ve learned that approaching your partner in the manner your describing, with defensiveness, only leads to arguments and not solutions.. for example, you started the post discussing what you contribute, but failed to acknowledge what she does. Looking after a small child is equivalent to a full time job and then some. Not that it discredits your labor and contribution to the household however it\u2019s never just being a \u201cSAHM.\u201d \n\nAs others have mentioned- perhaps your wife is feeling a loss of independence, a sense of being in a rut, and new mom blues. You didn\u2019t mention what she did before the child but I think taking into consideration that fact is important. Being a parent is absolutely all consuming in ways that people cannot understand unless they are a default parent themselves. They must think twice, about everything they do. Parents in your position generally do not carry that mental load because you have the freedom to work, stop for a coffee without thinking about lugging the baby, stroller, car seat out of the car/back in, or worrying if you packed xyz for the small coffee trip while also thinking about meals for the rest of the week, the doctors appointment the following day, and the laundry, and the sale at target for onesies, etc. I\u2019m just saying that the mental load of early parenthood is heavy, and it is absolutely heavier for the person who is the default parent or primary caretaker albeit mom or dad- in this case it\u2019s mom. \n\n\nI suggest approaching your wife in a gentler way.
