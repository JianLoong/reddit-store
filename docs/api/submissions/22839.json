It can be a slow and subtle descent into depression that she hasn't noticed.\n\nOr maybe she has and just doesn't know how to say it. Definitely ask her to go with you to a doctor. She may need medication and talk therapy. For that matter you should both see someone together as well.\n\nTry not to make this an 'her' problem. She may already be feeling like she's failing.

I was using social media as a tool to be OUTSIDE of what felt like a permanent indoor sentence not realizing that it wasn\u2019t really making me feel any better, just numbing me to real life and my internal clock that would typically say \u201cok I think you\u2019ve been on the phone long enough\u201d just stopped working \n\nAre you guys going on dates? \nIs she feeling depression/anxiety?\nDoes she have outings with her girl friends?\nDoes she have an outlet she can reach whenever needed such as friends or a therapist? \nDoes she have hobbies that she\u2019s able to participate in? \n\nAfter my argument with my partner I realized I was using my phone and social media to literally just escape because I 1.) didn\u2019t have any friends to talk to because I\u2019m the only one with children, & 2.) I never left the house other than for groceries because we were so busy with getting everything just right at home + my partner was working & we just never really did anything which put a grey lens over life and I realized the weight I was putting on him by never having the dishes clean when it was time to cook, only doing laundry when one of us ran out of underwear, really only cooking when he asked which if he was asking he was obviously hungry, which was a pain to have to wait for a meal to cook whereas I should have already had it done before him needing to ask.

Having an outlet and someone to talk to with no judgment helped me see my own faults and where I was trying to fill voids that I wasn\u2019t even aware of.

She maybe depressed, checked out. Like some said she may not be equipped for that lifestyle of a SAHM. You can also see about a part time daycare if you can? And she could get a job on the days the child goes to daycare. Away from the house doing something different etc. do chores together on the weekend make it fun somehow. But motivation is important as well. Complements at random times about things you notice and appreciate. What was your life like before the child? Was she much of a house caretaker before?

So right now she is watching a baby 24/7, cooking and cleaning.  I'm assuming she does the cooking because you said \"No she wasn't she used to be all for wanting to do laundry and and cook for me and just be my light in the darkness.\"\n\nI'm not saying you're not putting a lot of effort into this relationship and family. I am saying that being someone's light in the darkness, a full time mother, and in charge managing a household can lead to burnout. Even just carrying a baby can lead to burnout. You're mad at her for not keeping the apartment tidy enough and think its because she's on social media all day, but it is pretty easy to post something quickly to social media in between tasks. Is your son in clean diapers when you get home? Are there dirty dishes in the sink that sit for days and days? Is there grime on the floor that just never disappears? If you answer no to any of these questions, it means that she has been attentive to her son and cleaning.\n\nYou said that you play with your son from the time you get home until work, and that when you walk in for dinner your wife is on the phone. Is your wife making dinner or are you guys getting takeout? If she made the dinner, then she was doing things that didn't involve her phone and doing things that directly benefit you and your family. Also, you get to play with your son, but are you waking up with him in the middle of the night? Are you changing his diaper or helping potty train? Who is the one who deals with meltdowns and temper-tantrums throughout the day?? If it isnt you, its your wife. It is easy to notice the things she does not do, but it is hard to notice the things she does. It's not malicious, its human.\n\nListen, I'm not trying to attack you. It is really nice to hear that you care about your son and your family, and I don't doubt your work is very tiring and difficult. I am saying though that it is easy to miss all the things your wife does, and that in general the difficulty of managing a household is severely underplayed.\n\nEdit to add:  I think it's a great idea to have family outings on Sundays. I also think itd be a good idea to have more one on one time with your son, maybe take him to parks or kiddie pools or something, so you can have more time to bond with him when he's so young and your wife gets some time dedicated to relaxing and not having to worry about anything. Even if your wife isn't burntout, its a good way to prevent burnout before it happens.

She\u2019s not watching her son as closely as she should. He could have easily cut his finger wide open and you would be getting a call from her at the E.R, causing you to leave work to deal with something that could have easily been avoided. Did she have anything cooked? Were the dishes cleaned? Were the rooms clean or the floor swept? She needs to pull her weight. Asking you to take up her job on the weekends is not fair. Yes, you can help during the weekend but you shouldn\u2019t have to do it all. I think we need more information on this topic.

Last time I saw that it was on the railing outside. How did it get here?!\u201d \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: my son is 15 months. He\u2019s active, curious, and I\u2019m his favorite playmate. I frequently forget clothes in the wash cycle. Laundry piles up. Dishes often go from the dishwasher to the table to the sink until the dishwasher is empty, then I load it and run it again. When he naps, I do things like drink a cup of hot coffee. Pee alone. Shower. Get some work done. Make phone calls. It\u2019s fucking hard, and the rest of the time, I\u2019ve got someone touching me, climbing on me, biting me, screaming at me, babbling in my wake. \n\nThen my partner comes home and I remember there\u2019s a load of laundry on the dryer. He immediately spots something I haven\u2019t noticed for hours because 90% of my focus has been on the tiny ninja tyrant, and my partner could treat me like I haven\u2019t done shit all day. But he doesn\u2019t. He helps finish dinner and toddler wrangle and we work together to get through the evening. \n\nWhen was the last time you cared for your son all day on your own and tried to get household chores done? Because my guy can\u2019t even get lunch together for our kid without getting frustrated if I run errands. \n\nSo before you judge her too harshly, remember what your bathroom looked like when you lived alone.

I would\u2019ve have said the opposite if the house was mess but your child was taken care of. But since it\u2019s neither, your wife needs a wake up call.

I hate women who think it\u2019s alright to sit around and grow entitled thinking they do more than their husbands just because they\u2019ve been so removed from the work force that they\u2019ve forgotten or just never experienced how straining it is. My husband helps with the few things I ask him to and he is generally not a pig, but 90% of the cooking and cleaning is my job and I take pride in my work. If she doesn\u2019t want to do that, she can go get a job. You should be resting and bonding with your child on weekends, not cleaning so much that she doesn\u2019t have to do anything all week.", "Maybe check in with her?

That's the main conversation to be had and absolutely the focus. \n\n\"Do little things around the house\" is always a red flag because what that constitutes is different for different people and varies from a load of laundry to having the house spotless. If it is a functional home, everyone is healthy and safe, anything more is being judgey. And if you have a standard that doesn't meet, take some of the money from working 50hrs a week and throw it down for a cleaning service.  \n\nAlso, and this is obtuse - how good can a father be if they are home one day a week where they would actually see their kids? Those kids don't have a father.  Paying the bills alone doesn't make a good dad and if I had a nickel for every therapy client I have who is either one of these fathers who thinks that is enough or who are the child of one of these men, I could pay for my oen cleaning service. \n\nA messy house is seldom just laziness. It's poor mental health, a genuine lack of skills to accomodate for otherwise, and often weirdly high standards. \n\nPrioritize making the kid safe, then see if there are other things that could help her out.
