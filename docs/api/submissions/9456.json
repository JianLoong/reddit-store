By that I mean she has a Bachelor in Fine Arts. Ever since high school her dream has been to become a world renowned artist akin to Picasso, Dali and whatnot. Honestly, she doesn\u2019t have what it takes to be on that level. \n\nThing is she refuses to work in an industry where her skills would be needed, the most work she\u2019s ever done is as a cashier in retail. Forever hoping she\u2019s gonna \u201chit it big\u201d with one of her artworks.\n\nNow I always felt bad for Sue. Her mother made a lot of poor financial decisions and her piece of shit father walked out. My parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles helped them out financially from time to time. But their attitude towards my aunt was always \u201cshe did it with her own hands\u201d. \n\nOur family members were extremely pissed  that Sue chose to pursue fine arts. They all grew up during communism and see this sort of degree as a waste of time. They essentially stopped giving them any form of financial aid.\n\nI never stopped. About 5 years ago my friends and I got really interested in DnD. Essentially I talked to Sue and told her I'd give her a monthly sum of money and in exchange she\u2019d draw stuff for my DnD campaigns. She was reluctant at first saying \u201cher art is not for this sort of simple things\u201d but I think her mother convinced her to take the deal.\n\nInitially things were working out. I\u2019d pay her every month and she\u2019d send the drawings on time. But as time went she began being more and more off deadline. I'd always pay her on time, but she'd be weeks then months late. Last commission was for 10 artworks for a new campaign. She's essentially ghosted me for 4 months about it meanwhile I've still been paying her. \n\n  \nI had to delay the start 4 time and it really pissed me off, because at this point, it's about me letting down my friends. So I cancelled the January payment. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to contact me immediately. Only 8 days later she angrily calls me asking why she has no money in her bank account.\n\nAt the time I was tired and her attitude pissed me off so i gave it to her straight. I told her how she should be thankful for what I'm doing for her, instead she bites the hand that feeds her. How instead of dreaming she\u2019ll make it big, she use her skills to look for a real job.  I told her to stop being a leech of her family. And of course that she won\u2019t see a dime from me until she finishes those damned drawings, and after our deal is off.\n\nThen my aunt called me and cryingly begged me to send Sue the payment otherwise she'll have to starve for the month.\n\nI don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to about this. I know for a fact my family members would just encourage me to stop helping them. And my wife\u2019s attitude towards this problem is along the lines of \u2018we can afford it so just help her\u2019.", "created_utc": 1675874167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x3y2e/aita_for_letting_my_cousin_starve/", "score": 865, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to grow up and learn what being an adult means.", "NTA.\n\nIf i don't show up/ don't do my job at work I don't get paid. This is life. \n\nYou've been MORE than generous. You won't be responsible for her supposed \"starvation\", she is responsible for her own life, choices and money.", "NTA, obviously. How on earth has this cousin managed to convince you that it is somehow your responsibility to just give her money for nothing?", "NTA. If she needs the money that badly, she should start working on those commissions.", "NTA. You made an agreement, she didn't keep up her end of the bargain, why should you keep yours?", "NTA. You're not doing your cousin any favors by continuing to pay her for doing nothing.\n\nI've been a working artist for many years, and most people like me never achieve what your cousin is dreaming of. Continuing to wait for it while doing nothing to generate regular income is not going to work. Most artists never have that one piece that hits and makes them famous, and have to learn to create many streams of revenue in order to keep themselves going. So, for me, that means selling original work, but also selling image sheets, teaching classes, ad revenue from two of my four web sites, running a Patreon and a Substack, building my following on social media, having designs available on print on demand sites, books on Amazon---whatever I can think of to bring a few bucks in.\n\nYour cousin needs some hustle. Withdrawing your support might light a fire under her butt, which is what she's going to need to make it as a working artist.", "NTA and you're really not helping her. She needs to figure out how she's going to make her way in this world. How does she want to use her skills and what kind of work would she like to do UNTIL the time she's discovered as a great artist.", "NTA. Sometimes we need a slap of reality. But if your wife thinks you should help, then get her a gift card for a grocery store. She won't starve, and she can also buy toiletries.", "NTA\n\nYou had a deal, and she did not follow through on her end for months.

If she is not able to deliver on time and with quality, it is her fault for not receiving the money. As you already mentioned: Do not bite the hand that feeds you. \n\nSeems like she needs to learn it the hard way.", "NTA, as other said cut contact. If you really care, you could give her money for the month so she doesn't starve but tell her its the last one. That way she at least has a month to figure something out. But I would not necessarily feel the need to do that.", "NTA you were paying her to create something for you so if she doesn\u2019t deliver than she shouldn\u2019t get paid. Unless she can show you a piece of work that\u2019s almost complete then I don\u2019t think you owe her anything. I don\u2019t think giving her more money just because you have the money to give us a good idea. She\u2019s already taking advantage of the fact you kept paying her even when she didn\u2019t give you what you wanted so this point she\u2019s just expecting you to pay her.

One works for Disney in animation. The other owns a studio in Hawaii. They both worked so hard to get where they are. They both took these kinds of small jobs to improve their skill and give them something for a resum\u00e9. \n\nBesides the two people that I know who made it as artists, I know at least 10 others that didn't make it, but are able to still get paid doing exactly the kind of thing that you are paying her to do.

You are not obligated to enable Sue's \"lifestyle\" just because you can afford it.  She is a grown woman.  This is her choice.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t pay my employees when they aren\u2019t working, neither should you, even if she\u2019s family. \n\nIf she needs money, she can get a different job.", "NTA. You\u2019re holding up your end of the bargain but she isn\u2019t, not cool. She is 29. She needs to reprioritize some things it seems.", "NTA. This is akin to if she just stopped showing up at the office and still demanded to be paid. If there are circumstances causing her to miss deadlines, she should be communicating those to you, just like she would call a regular boss and explain a work absence.", "NTA\n\nShe's older than you are. She won't \"starve\" because you didn't pay her for the work she didn't do. She'll either mooch off someone else, or grow up and do some work or she'll go to a food bank. It ain't that serious.\n\nAnd your aunt is literally asking you to give up on your agreement, and just pay your cousin's bills in perpetuity.\n\nMy solution would be to put a price on each type of artwork, and pay for each individually, after she does them, until she gets her crap together.", "NTA. No work done = no payment. Easy as that.\n\nYour aunt is trying to guilt you because she is a leech just like her daughter, and it's easier to cry on the phone than find an actual job and start being a real adult. Time to cut that shitshow off.", "NTA, she's a lazy dreamer.  You have done more than enough.   If she's ever going to survive. She needs a dose of reality.   Anyone who sends her money for nothing is an enabler.", "NTA and man I'd love to have a monthly commission. That was a generous offer and she essentially didn't show up for work, you don't owe her an allowance.", "NTA. While I don't understand the 'artistic temperament '/starving in a garrett etc. That's her choice and, whether you can afford it or not, at 29, she needs to accept the consequences of her decisions.\n\nYour DnD artwork may not be the sort of art she wants to do, fair enough, but she can't take payment for work she doesn't want to do so isn't doing.\n\nTbh, I think she's a cheeky mare and you have supported her long enough. I assume she didn't graduate last week so she has had some time to earn some money from her art but isn't. When my boys were younger, they and all their friends wanted to be professional footballers, yeah, that didn't happen! If wishes were horses and all that......", "NTA - The unfortunate reality is that most artists will never reach the recognition that Picasso, Dali, or Van Gogh had unless they are genuinely a prodigy. Even then it's partially up to chance that they'll be found among the millions and millions of other artists trying to achieve the same dream.\n\nBecoming a sensation isn't often something that happens overnight, so the reality is that she should continue making art, and lots of it, if she hopes to make it a living some day. And there are plenty of practical routes that artists can use to make a living that don't require selling paintings for millions of dollars. One such avenue is what you've described, making art for games. Another could be making art for picture books, or simply selling their prints on etsy.\n\nThe bottom line is that if she doesn't want to make art for \"simple\" things, then she won't be able to support herself or practice her skill enough to make it to the fame she wants to achieve.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In fact, you probably could sue her for that 4 months of pay she didn't earn. If she wants money, she can  get a job. Find someone else to do the art, or do it yourself. \n\nIt doesn't matter if you can afford it. Your cousin is a leech and will always \"need\" money as long as you're willing to give it. Cut her off. Tell her to get a job and leave you alone. There are ways to get emergency food, BTW. \n\nThis is on her, leave it on her.", "NTA\n\nShe's 29!", "NTA. Just like anyone who is hoping to 'make it big' you have to strike a balance between 'paying the bills' and 'working on your dream.' \n\nActors wait tables. Musicians play small gigs or busk. And artists do commercial or contract artwork. If you do good work in your 'day job' then you can afford the time and expense to 'work on your dream'. Like for example...spend a week doing D&D drawings, then use that money to pay bills for the month. Then you can spend the other 3 weeks of the month working on the art you're actually passionate about that might 'make it big'.\n\nWe all live in the real world, and that requires money to live. She just needs to grow up and learn to find a balance between her dream and her reality.", "NTA. She didn't do the work. She doesn't get paid. Period. You've already been so generous giving her money ahead of work completed and being flexible with deadlines. No one else would do this for her, and I'm sure you pay more for this sort of thing than anyone else would. Also, I understand the argument of helping because you can afford to but I think that more applies with people who can't help themselves due to situational factories or health conditions, disabilities, etc. Sure, you're able to help. But she's also able to get off her ass and get a job. You're enabling her and you need to stop. Lastly, just because you can afford to now doesn't mean that you couldn't use that money to enrich your life in some way or to put away for a rainy day.", "NTA\n\nNo service, no money.", "NTA.

Did you end up giving her more pocket money?", "NTA. OP, send your aunt a link to a food bank. You're not obligated to give them money. \n\nOnce she gives you the art you paid for, I'd completely end the arrangement and tell her to plan to not receive any more money for you.\n\nI'm a writer. Do you know what I did until I started making a full-time salary? I worked another job. This woman needs a wake-up call, and she won't get one if you keep bailing her out.", "I agree, but am I the only one who had to go back a couple times and look at \"grew up during communism\"?\n\nWhat does this mean? What does it have to do with deadbeat artists? Why would people think that regardless of whether it's a good idea that sending money to a family member is communism? Are we still fighting the Cold War and having Mccarthy hearings and I didn't get the memo?\n\nI have so many questions", "They are called starving artists for a reason.

Twentieth century, painted pictures about the rise of fascism/exchanged letters with the Marx Brothers Picasso and Dali? They only got famous centuries after their death last century?", "Neither Picasso nor Dal\u00ed died poor, by a longshot, and neither has been dead more than fifty years.\n\nHowever, the cousin has been offered an opportunity to earn money from her art and has looked down her nose at the opportunity, so it's a pretty safe bet that *she's* going to die poor and unknown.", "Yeah, sadly, plus with stays in mental hospitals.", "Dude don\u2019t blame yourself for HER actions and her lack of respect/responsibility to the contract you provided for both her and you. \n\nActually- maybe that\u2019s the way, see about sitting down with both parties and signing a contract for work/service for both parties in terms of pay and if either party breaks it or something?

I could be wrong, no idea how much money you were actually giving her, maybe she'd still be in the same place she is now... just something to think about when you decide what you do going forward...\n\nTo be clear, I don't think you owe her anything at this point... but it'd be pretty big of you if you were able to forgive the things she said and managed to still work something out with her, and not cut her off completely... but again, I wouldn't blame you if you didn't...\n\nFamily is hard sometimes... good luck...", "She does not use her degree for anything that's why it's worthless. \nShe wants to be fed by OP.", "No clue who that is but it's entirely probable, that's what cult leaders, evangelists, US senators, talk show hosts, and self-help gurus do.", "I think that's likely!  \n\nI did the tour there a few years ago, and was left with the impression that the woman was bored/lonely and wanted to keep people employed, and had more money than she knew what to do with.  I think all the paranormal stuff has been greatly exaggerated over the years, and encouraged by people making money off of her.", "I\u2019m familiar with the Winchester house but didn\u2019t know it had its own \u2018psychic\u2019.  Is this some onsite person?\n\nThe Winchester house (if I\u2019m remembering correctly) was built by the widow/heiress of the Winchester rifle fortune.  Convince that the ghosts of all those killed by Winchester rifles were out to haunt her, her house was built with stairways/hallways/doors that went no where, to confuse the ghosts.  It was in continual renovation until her death, and is now a California landmark.\n\nAlthough NOW, any reference to a Winchester means Sam and/or Dean.  I was trying to figure which psychic was being referred to, lol.", "Yea, does OP want a new artist cousin??", "That makes more sense, but still not seeing the parallels to a deadbeat artist family member."]}
