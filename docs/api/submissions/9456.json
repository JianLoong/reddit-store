By that I mean she has a Bachelor in Fine Arts. Ever since high school her dream has been to become a world renowned artist akin to Picasso, Dali and whatnot. Honestly, she doesn\u2019t have what it takes to be on that level. \n\nThing is she refuses to work in an industry where her skills would be needed, the most work she\u2019s ever done is as a cashier in retail. Forever hoping she\u2019s gonna \u201chit it big\u201d with one of her artworks.\n\nNow I always felt bad for Sue. Her mother made a lot of poor financial decisions and her piece of shit father walked out. My parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles helped them out financially from time to time. But their attitude towards my aunt was always \u201cshe did it with her own hands\u201d. \n\nOur family members were extremely pissed  that Sue chose to pursue fine arts. They all grew up during communism and see this sort of degree as a waste of time. They essentially stopped giving them any form of financial aid.\n\nI never stopped. About 5 years ago my friends and I got really interested in DnD. Essentially I talked to Sue and told her I'd give her a monthly sum of money and in exchange she\u2019d draw stuff for my DnD campaigns. She was reluctant at first saying \u201cher art is not for this sort of simple things\u201d but I think her mother convinced her to take the deal.\n\nInitially things were working out. I\u2019d pay her every month and she\u2019d send the drawings on time. But as time went she began being more and more off deadline. I'd always pay her on time, but she'd be weeks then months late. Last commission was for 10 artworks for a new campaign. She's essentially ghosted me for 4 months about it meanwhile I've still been paying her. \n\n  \nI had to delay the start 4 time and it really pissed me off, because at this point, it's about me letting down my friends. So I cancelled the January payment. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to contact me immediately. Only 8 days later she angrily calls me asking why she has no money in her bank account.\n\nAt the time I was tired and her attitude pissed me off so i gave it to her straight. I told her how she should be thankful for what I'm doing for her, instead she bites the hand that feeds her. How instead of dreaming she\u2019ll make it big, she use her skills to look for a real job.  I told her to stop being a leech of her family. And of course that she won\u2019t see a dime from me until she finishes those damned drawings, and after our deal is off.\n\nThen my aunt called me and cryingly begged me to send Sue the payment otherwise she'll have to starve for the month.\n\nI don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to about this. I know for a fact my family members would just encourage me to stop helping them. And my wife\u2019s attitude towards this problem is along the lines of \u2018we can afford it so just help her\u2019.", "created_utc": 1675874167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x3y2e/aita_for_letting_my_cousin_starve/", "score": 2630, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to grow up and learn what being an adult means.", "NTA.\n\nIf i don't show up/ don't do my job at work I don't get paid. This is life. \n\nYou've been MORE than generous. You won't be responsible for her supposed \"starvation\", she is responsible for her own life, choices and money.", "NTA, obviously. How on earth has this cousin managed to convince you that it is somehow your responsibility to just give her money for nothing?", "NTA. If she needs the money that badly, she should start working on those commissions.", "NTA. You made an agreement, she didn't keep up her end of the bargain, why should you keep yours?", "NTA. You're not doing your cousin any favors by continuing to pay her for doing nothing.\n\nI've been a working artist for many years, and most people like me never achieve what your cousin is dreaming of. Continuing to wait for it while doing nothing to generate regular income is not going to work. Most artists never have that one piece that hits and makes them famous, and have to learn to create many streams of revenue in order to keep themselves going. So, for me, that means selling original work, but also selling image sheets, teaching classes, ad revenue from two of my four web sites, running a Patreon and a Substack, building my following on social media, having designs available on print on demand sites, books on Amazon---whatever I can think of to bring a few bucks in.\n\nYour cousin needs some hustle. Withdrawing your support might light a fire under her butt, which is what she's going to need to make it as a working artist.", "NTA and you're really not helping her. She needs to figure out how she's going to make her way in this world. How does she want to use her skills and what kind of work would she like to do UNTIL the time she's discovered as a great artist.", "NTA. Sometimes we need a slap of reality. But if your wife thinks you should help, then get her a gift card for a grocery store. She won't starve, and she can also buy toiletries.", "NTA\n\nYou had a deal, and she did not follow through on her end for months.

If she is not able to deliver on time and with quality, it is her fault for not receiving the money.

If you really care, you could give her money for the month so she doesn't starve but tell her its the last one. That way she at least has a month to figure something out. But I would not necessarily feel the need to do that.", "NTA you were paying her to create something for you so if she doesn\u2019t deliver than she shouldn\u2019t get paid. Unless she can show you a piece of work that\u2019s almost complete then I don\u2019t think you owe her anything. I don\u2019t think giving her more money just because you have the money to give us a good idea. She\u2019s already taking advantage of the fact you kept paying her even when she didn\u2019t give you what you wanted so this point she\u2019s just expecting you to pay her.

One works for Disney in animation. The other owns a studio in Hawaii. They both worked so hard to get where they are. They both took these kinds of small jobs to improve their skill and give them something for a resum\u00e9. \n\nBesides the two people that I know who made it as artists, I know at least 10 others that didn't make it, but are able to still get paid doing exactly the kind of thing that you are paying her to do.

You are not obligated to enable Sue's \"lifestyle\" just because you can afford it.  She is a grown woman.  This is her choice.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t pay my employees when they aren\u2019t working, neither should you, even if she\u2019s family. \n\nIf she needs money, she can get a different job.", "NTA. You\u2019re holding up your end of the bargain but she isn\u2019t, not cool. She is 29. She needs to reprioritize some things it seems.", "NTA. This is akin to if she just stopped showing up at the office and still demanded to be paid. If there are circumstances causing her to miss deadlines, she should be communicating those to you, just like she would call a regular boss and explain a work absence.", "NTA\n\nShe's older than you are. She won't \"starve\" because you didn't pay her for the work she didn't do. She'll either mooch off someone else, or grow up and do some work or she'll go to a food bank. It ain't that serious.\n\nAnd your aunt is literally asking you to give up on your agreement, and just pay your cousin's bills in perpetuity.\n\nMy solution would be to put a price on each type of artwork, and pay for each individually, after she does them, until she gets her crap together.", "NTA. No work done = no payment. Easy as that.\n\nYour aunt is trying to guilt you because she is a leech just like her daughter, and it's easier to cry on the phone than find an actual job and start being a real adult. Time to cut that shitshow off.", "NTA, she's a lazy dreamer.  You have done more than enough.   If she's ever going to survive. She needs a dose of reality.   Anyone who sends her money for nothing is an enabler.", "NTA and man I'd love to have a monthly commission. That was a generous offer and she essentially didn't show up for work, you don't owe her an allowance.", "NTA. While I don't understand the 'artistic temperament '/starving in a garrett etc. That's her choice and, whether you can afford it or not, at 29, she needs to accept the consequences of her decisions.\n\nYour DnD artwork may not be the sort of art she wants to do, fair enough, but she can't take payment for work she doesn't want to do so isn't doing.\n\nTbh, I think she's a cheeky mare and you have supported her long enough. I assume she didn't graduate last week so she has had some time to earn some money from her art but isn't. When my boys were younger, they and all their friends wanted to be professional footballers, yeah, that didn't happen! If wishes were horses and all that......", "NTA - The unfortunate reality is that most artists will never reach the recognition that Picasso, Dali, or Van Gogh had unless they are genuinely a prodigy. Even then it's partially up to chance that they'll be found among the millions and millions of other artists trying to achieve the same dream.\n\nBecoming a sensation isn't often something that happens overnight, so the reality is that she should continue making art, and lots of it, if she hopes to make it a living some day. And there are plenty of practical routes that artists can use to make a living that don't require selling paintings for millions of dollars. One such avenue is what you've described, making art for games. Another could be making art for picture books, or simply selling their prints on etsy.\n\nThe bottom line is that if she doesn't want to make art for \"simple\" things, then she won't be able to support herself or practice her skill enough to make it to the fame she wants to achieve.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Employees included Americans, Dutch, Italians, Irish, Chinese, and Japanese (at the time, there were few or no Mexicans, Native Americans, or Blacks in the area) \u2014 an almost unheard-of diversity by the standards of the day. She paid her employees very well and gave them free housing, though in keeping with convention of the day, Asian employees were only loaned housing and were paid less. Having the Asian employees at all, particularly the Japanese, raised additional suspicion of Sallie and fueled more speculation that she was into weird mysticism. Sallie was, by all accounts that Spoon was able to uncover, universally liked and respected by all her employees. Not one ever mentioned ghosts or s\u00e9ances or guilt over Winchester rifle victims, or had an ill word of any kind. Sallie even gave the builders paid days off when it was too hot to work. Having plenty in a time and place where poverty was the rule, Sallie Winchester, already the nation's greatest female philanthropist, employed hundreds to build a house she did not need. She simply wanted to keep as many people employed as she could. It didn't even matter what they built. If she had a fancy for a new wing, indulging it fed scores of families.\n\n>This was the crime for which history has sentenced Sallie Winchester to be remembered only by the slander. The tour guides and popular articles rarely speak of the shrewd investor, the generous employer, or her prodigious philanthropy. They speak of a tiny, reclusive woman, racked with guilt and fear, obsessed with spirits and the paranormal, maniacally building a maze to confound her demons. Many even do her the additional indignity of holding her up as a cautionary tale of the perils and pitfalls of unrestrained belief in the supernatural. I argue that we should watch out instead for the perils and pitfalls of accepting the popular version of any story, especially a sensationalized one, and take the time to find the truth. Open up that wall. Find the real truth, and the real treasure; and always remember the real Aunt Sallie.", "this may be true, but there's no concrete proof she saw a psychic!

So she shouldn't be above it.", "I dont need to read this to say no but i did anyway lol \n\nI mean if she can walk around, move her legs, has arms, can use her arms, has a mouth ears and eyes, can use mouth, ears, and eyes.

This girl needs a serious wake up call in life\u2014 if your aunt is so concerned, she can help your cousin herself or better yet, give her a serious talk about her refusal to work in life.\n\nAs someone who works in a creative capacity, I\u2019ll fully admit it took me over a decade to get where I\u2019m at, and I\u2019m still working at it. Until I was able to do it full time though, I worked my butt off in the service industry while pursuing my passion on the side. Most people I know in this field did the same.

Fine art artist can make it but it takes so much to build up to it and idk what this cousin is doing to even achieve that. \n\nDND, furries, and streamers requests can really make you have the bank for it especially DND and furries (especially especially furries) NSFW Art can make big bank too if you know you\u2019re talent. Sakimichichan (what I call her) makes about $30,000 a month from patron!! She even has assistants now cuz of this to help her keep track. \n\nIdk how strong his cousin\u2019s art prices are but if she went thru patreon to help build her audience she has to know she needs to keep it up. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I hold off sometimes cuz my skills do get rusty. She can take her pieces and turn them into merch if she wanted to like notebooks, stickers, pins, and etc to gain a business. Being an artist also means to be an influencer, a business person, and learning to market their demographics. \n\nThe last bit is extremely important and possibly and probably the hardest for his cousin: if she\u2019s trying to be that \u201cartist\u201d it\u2019s all about networking and connections. Art galleries is based on favoritism and knowing those people thus building rapports. That\u2019s how you get your name plastered which is difficult unless you\u2019re lucky. It\u2019s an unfair situation but it\u2019s one of the reasons why I hate Dada although I don\u2019t agree with it but it\u2019s art.", "What would the other side be?

(Van Gogh died unknown and penniless but his SIL was a great marketer.) There were many artists on that level of equal skill. They just aren\u2019t as well known.\n\nMost of art is practice. Some people get lucky and have talent, so they start higher up on the stair. Everyone else starts at the bottom and has to climb, but not having a boost doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t reach the heights. With practice they can reach the summit. The more you do it, the better you become.\n\nArt is a lot of work. It doesn\u2019t really ever come naturally.

Seeing some short videos of ppl showing her Commissions and talking about the rates they do is crazy.

And you are correct on furries lol basically think of Disney with zootopia would prolly be the best to explain it. Basically a personification of an animal but on a different level than dnd. It\u2019s like a persona of sorts vs being acting your dnd character. There\u2019s usually a lot of negative stigma with furries cuz it does get mistaken for certain sex situations.

They weren\u2019t stairs to nowhere at the beginning. She was just a rich lady who enjoyed interior design, and kept remaking her rooms until she was too old to do it anymore and her house suffered a natural disaster. I can think of worse ways for the rich to spend their money. Better that she should employ craftsman for her hobby then just sit on an endless fortune."]}
