By that I mean she has a Bachelor in Fine Arts. Ever since high school her dream has been to become a world renowned artist akin to Picasso, Dali and whatnot. Honestly, she doesn\u2019t have what it takes to be on that level. \n\nThing is she refuses to work in an industry where her skills would be needed, the most work she\u2019s ever done is as a cashier in retail. Forever hoping she\u2019s gonna \u201chit it big\u201d with one of her artworks.\n\nNow I always felt bad for Sue. Her mother made a lot of poor financial decisions and her piece of shit father walked out. My parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles helped them out financially from time to time. But their attitude towards my aunt was always \u201cshe did it with her own hands\u201d. \n\nOur family members were extremely pissed  that Sue chose to pursue fine arts. They all grew up during communism and see this sort of degree as a waste of time. They essentially stopped giving them any form of financial aid.\n\nI never stopped. About 5 years ago my friends and I got really interested in DnD. Essentially I talked to Sue and told her I'd give her a monthly sum of money and in exchange she\u2019d draw stuff for my DnD campaigns. She was reluctant at first saying \u201cher art is not for this sort of simple things\u201d but I think her mother convinced her to take the deal.\n\nInitially things were working out. I\u2019d pay her every month and she\u2019d send the drawings on time. But as time went she began being more and more off deadline. I'd always pay her on time, but she'd be weeks then months late. Last commission was for 10 artworks for a new campaign. She's essentially ghosted me for 4 months about it meanwhile I've still been paying her. \n\n  \nI had to delay the start 4 time and it really pissed me off, because at this point, it's about me letting down my friends. So I cancelled the January payment. She couldn\u2019t even be bothered to contact me immediately. Only 8 days later she angrily calls me asking why she has no money in her bank account.\n\nAt the time I was tired and her attitude pissed me off so i gave it to her straight. I told her how she should be thankful for what I'm doing for her, instead she bites the hand that feeds her. How instead of dreaming she\u2019ll make it big, she use her skills to look for a real job.  I told her to stop being a leech of her family. And of course that she won\u2019t see a dime from me until she finishes those damned drawings, and after our deal is off.\n\nThen my aunt called me and cryingly begged me to send Sue the payment otherwise she'll have to starve for the month.\n\nI don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to about this. I know for a fact my family members would just encourage me to stop helping them. And my wife\u2019s attitude towards this problem is along the lines of \u2018we can afford it so just help her\u2019.", "created_utc": 1675874167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10x3y2e/aita_for_letting_my_cousin_starve/", "score": 431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needs to grow up and learn what being an adult means.", "NTA.\n\nIf i don't show up/ don't do my job at work I don't get paid. This is life. \n\nYou've been MORE than generous. You won't be responsible for her supposed \"starvation\", she is responsible for her own life, choices and money.", "NTA, obviously. How on earth has this cousin managed to convince you that it is somehow your responsibility to just give her money for nothing?", "NTA. If she needs the money that badly, she should start working on those commissions.", "NTA. You made an agreement, she didn't keep up her end of the bargain, why should you keep yours?", "NTA. You're not doing your cousin any favors by continuing to pay her for doing nothing.\n\nI've been a working artist for many years, and most people like me never achieve what your cousin is dreaming of. Continuing to wait for it while doing nothing to generate regular income is not going to work. Most artists never have that one piece that hits and makes them famous, and have to learn to create many streams of revenue in order to keep themselves going. So, for me, that means selling original work, but also selling image sheets, teaching classes, ad revenue from two of my four web sites, running a Patreon and a Substack, building my following on social media, having designs available on print on demand sites, books on Amazon---whatever I can think of to bring a few bucks in.\n\nYour cousin needs some hustle. Withdrawing your support might light a fire under her butt, which is what she's going to need to make it as a working artist.", "NTA and you're really not helping her. She needs to figure out how she's going to make her way in this world. How does she want to use her skills and what kind of work would she like to do UNTIL the time she's discovered as a great artist.", "NTA. Sometimes we need a slap of reality. But if your wife thinks you should help, then get her a gift card for a grocery store. She won't starve, and she can also buy toiletries.", "NTA\n\nYou had a deal, and she did not follow through on her end for months.

If she is not able to deliver on time and with quality, it is her fault for not receiving the money. As you already mentioned: Do not bite the hand that feeds you. \n\nSeems like she needs to learn it the hard way.", "NTA, as other said cut contact. If you really care, you could give her money for the month so she doesn't starve but tell her its the last one. That way she at least has a month to figure something out. But I would not necessarily feel the need to do that.", "NTA you were paying her to create something for you so if she doesn\u2019t deliver than she shouldn\u2019t get paid. Unless she can show you a piece of work that\u2019s almost complete then I don\u2019t think you owe her anything. I don\u2019t think giving her more money just because you have the money to give us a good idea. She\u2019s already taking advantage of the fact you kept paying her even when she didn\u2019t give you what you wanted so this point she\u2019s just expecting you to pay her.

One works for Disney in animation. The other owns a studio in Hawaii. They both worked so hard to get where they are. They both took these kinds of small jobs to improve their skill and give them something for a resum\u00e9. \n\nBesides the two people that I know who made it as artists, I know at least 10 others that didn't make it, but are able to still get paid doing exactly the kind of thing that you are paying her to do.

You are not obligated to enable Sue's \"lifestyle\" just because you can afford it.  She is a grown woman.  This is her choice.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t pay my employees when they aren\u2019t working, neither should you, even if she\u2019s family. \n\nIf she needs money, she can get a different job.", "NTA. You\u2019re holding up your end of the bargain but she isn\u2019t, not cool. She is 29. She needs to reprioritize some things it seems.", "NTA. This is akin to if she just stopped showing up at the office and still demanded to be paid. If there are circumstances causing her to miss deadlines, she should be communicating those to you, just like she would call a regular boss and explain a work absence.", "NTA\n\nShe's older than you are. She won't \"starve\" because you didn't pay her for the work she didn't do. She'll either mooch off someone else, or grow up and do some work or she'll go to a food bank. It ain't that serious.\n\nAnd your aunt is literally asking you to give up on your agreement, and just pay your cousin's bills in perpetuity.\n\nMy solution would be to put a price on each type of artwork, and pay for each individually, after she does them, until she gets her crap together.", "NTA. No work done = no payment. Easy as that.\n\nYour aunt is trying to guilt you because she is a leech just like her daughter, and it's easier to cry on the phone than find an actual job and start being a real adult. Time to cut that shitshow off.", "NTA, she's a lazy dreamer.  You have done more than enough.   If she's ever going to survive. She needs a dose of reality.   Anyone who sends her money for nothing is an enabler.", "NTA and man I'd love to have a monthly commission. That was a generous offer and she essentially didn't show up for work, you don't owe her an allowance.", "NTA. While I don't understand the 'artistic temperament '/starving in a garrett etc. That's her choice and, whether you can afford it or not, at 29, she needs to accept the consequences of her decisions.\n\nYour DnD artwork may not be the sort of art she wants to do, fair enough, but she can't take payment for work she doesn't want to do so isn't doing.\n\nTbh, I think she's a cheeky mare and you have supported her long enough. I assume she didn't graduate last week so she has had some time to earn some money from her art but isn't. When my boys were younger, they and all their friends wanted to be professional footballers, yeah, that didn't happen! If wishes were horses and all that......", "NTA - The unfortunate reality is that most artists will never reach the recognition that Picasso, Dali, or Van Gogh had unless they are genuinely a prodigy. Even then it's partially up to chance that they'll be found among the millions and millions of other artists trying to achieve the same dream.\n\nBecoming a sensation isn't often something that happens overnight, so the reality is that she should continue making art, and lots of it, if she hopes to make it a living some day. And there are plenty of practical routes that artists can use to make a living that don't require selling paintings for millions of dollars. One such avenue is what you've described, making art for games. Another could be making art for picture books, or simply selling their prints on etsy.\n\nThe bottom line is that if she doesn't want to make art for \"simple\" things, then she won't be able to support herself or practice her skill enough to make it to the fame she wants to achieve.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were not giving Sue \"financial aid\".  You were paying her to create artwork for you DnD campaigns. She did not deliver her art as promised, so you did not pay her.

Cut her off.", "NTA\u2026 your cousin knows most famous artists weren\u2019t famous while they were alive, right? A few of them had wealthy patrons that housed them and covered supplies and food but they were expected to provide art usually of the patron or their families on a regular basis, and that was during the renaissance. Basically all artists after the 1800s came from wealthy families, had another job and the art was more of a hobby, or were fucking poor their whole lives.", "NTA. You basically became her patron and she wasn\u2019t fulfilling her end of the arrangement. Would a month in advance warning have been nice? But then you also might have gotten crap from your aunt for the \u201cthreat\u201d. Is your aunt not capable of working herself?

Send her a message stating you have paid X a month for Y months and have not received the agreed artwork, as such you want the money back. \n\nNot to necessarily get it from her but because if she pulled this trick on a 'proper' client not a family member they would sure as hell want their money back due to lack of service provided and she could end up in more shit than just a missing payment.", "NTA.  You pay for a service, and you don't receive it, the pay stops. As for your wife, she needs a wakeup call.  Whether you can afford it or not does not matter.

She needs to grow up. You give her a commission, you agree on the money, how much paid upfront and how much at delivery, you set deadlines and write into the contract what happens when she is not on time (and what happens when you are not on time with payments - not that this will happen, but just to have a normal contract) ... No more regular payments for sometimes work, real contracted work. If she agrees and does her part and others want to use her services you can recommend her... If she doesn't take it you can assume that she found another source of income and isn't starving.\n\nThat's of course nothing you have to do, because you don't owe her anything, it's just something you might want to consider if you want to go on supporting her, but don't want to be exploited by her.", "NTA. You were paying her for services that she wasn't providing. You wouldn't continue to pay a plumber who hadn't turned up for work repeatedly with no good reason, being family doesn't give her a pass.

You gave ample warning. Even the greats had patrons who supported them as your doing. If she is too high on her own farts  then looks like she's gonna have to figure it out for herself. Fa,fo.", "NTA, she wants to be an artist so you're treating her like an artist. You were acting as her benefactor, providing her an income which allowed her to pursue art, so long as she creates some pieces of art for you. She has failed to produce the art, so you're pulling your funding. No one pays an artist for a commission not received.", "NTA. So no again, and send her a list of local food banks.", "NTA, your cousin needs to grow up and deal with the fact that her career strategy is effectively the same as buying a lottery ticket every week as an investment. She\u2019s had too many \u2018special snowflake\u2019 conversations with someone in her life and bought into the propaganda. Actually being a starving artist is not in the least \u2018romantic\u2019.\n\nReal working artists only get and stay employed by doing the work and damn few are drawing what they want to draw. \n\nI knew an amazing artist on DA a decade ago who as an art student in animation had a side gig for extra cash by drawing to order and selling prints of her work on DA. Mostly furry porn, custom game characters and some really weird fetish manga. It paid. She gave it up after graduating and getting a real job in animation and said she was glad to ditch the creeper crap. Some of her customers were unsettling and the stuff they asked for is why the term \u2018brain bleach\u2019 was coined.\n\nOne of my favourite authors described this attitude in the wannabe author type this way: \n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to write, they want to have written and become famous so they don\u2019t have to write.\u201d", "NTA.

I\u2019m sorry you are in this situation.  Working with / for family is always difficult.  When you do, you should be prepared to just gift whatever it is or walk away.

IDK why she decided to ditch the responsibility.", "You can lead a horse(?not sure which animal it was tbh) to water, but you can't make it drink.
