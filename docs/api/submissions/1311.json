He started talking about pets and wanting a chinchilla, a fox, a cat, a dog, an otter, a skunk, but he really wants two African Grey parrots. (This is the topic) \n\nWe\u2019re both autistic, and parrots I find a bit loud, and can be a lot of work, and I\u2019m worried that if I end up working from home or am a STAHM that I will be required to drop what I\u2019m doing and  care for them. Also, things cost a lot of money and he doesn\u2019t seem to get that. \n\nHe assures that will not be the case. But when I bring other concerns up, he dismisses me and begins to get more irritated that I\u2019m not immediately on board. 20 years is a long commitment for the birds and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m going to be the person that ends up with them. \n\nPartner then stated that it would be fine and he did his research and relationships require compromise. He then mumbled about he would get them before he got a house and wouldn\u2019t tell me that he did until I moved in with him.\n\nI was appalled and then just switched to a straight no repeatedly and the fact he is entertaining the thought about deceiving me is of a red flag of itself.\n\nHe ended up exploding and telling me that this was his dream and he said \u201cthought I knew you.\u201d And when I didn\u2019t know how to reply and was silent, he hung up on me.\n\nI know I\u2019m sometimes a difficult person with some anxiety/social issues but my partner doesn\u2019t often think and my therapist says I should stand up for myself more. I feel guilty anytime I do and I just want to say that he can get them if he wants, but I wasn\u2019t sure if I felt comfortable dealing with a potential 20 year problem. \n\nI\u2019m worried that I could\u2019ve come off as mean or controlling because I\u2019d like to have a dog to protect the home and, and he seemed on board with it before, but I was a little more worried about how he told me he would care for the birds just fine. But when I asked, he just told me to drop it because he knows his research. And that\u2019s a big commitment as well as a dog but I have experience and understand what I would be getting into. (I never asked him to take \u201cmy side\u201d, or make a compromise.) He\u2019s currently ignoring me and I feel horrible for it. AITA for bringing up concerns and not agreeing with him?\n\nI apologize if I made a big deal out of nothing. (I have had a few issues in the past and my friends say he\u2019s bad news. And I wanted an opinion to make sure I\u2019m not going crazy.)\n\nAnd I will accept any judgement I get. Thank you so much for your time to read/respond.

Your boyfriend not respecting your wishes to not house a very bizarre petting zoo is one of the strangest things I've ever read. Major red flag.  RUN!!!!", "NTA. Take his reaction as the red flag it is, and really reconsider this relationship. You said he was dismissive of your legitimate concerns, became irritated, threatened to get the parrots without telling you, and exploded at you. I don\u2019t know how long you two have been together, but it sounds like he just showed you who really is. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. \n\nIf he can\u2019t even have a conversation around potential pets then you are right for being hesitant.

If he\u2019s admitting to your face he\u2019s fine doing things he knows you don\u2019t agree with behind your back, I\u2019m not sure how you recover from that.

African grey's live 23 yrs in the wild, but in captivity it's more like 40.  It is a huge commitment and costly as there are few bird veterinarians.  I don't think bf is concerned at all about his commitment to you, your future kids, etc. and you need to break it off with him.\n\nNTA"]}
