The parents and or anyone else can assist, but the responsibility of paying for post-secondary education is fully on the student. \n\nThat does not answer the question of the parent loan. Legally, it is the parent\u2019s responsibility. Morally, it\u2019s determined based on the agreements made at the time the loan was taken out, and your particular moral views of the responsibilities that families have for each other, along with your moral views of how the failure of one family member to meet those responsibilities impacts other family member\u2019s responsibilities to that individual.", "So what was the point of your story when you did exactly what I suggested to OP?", "Took loans that he knowingly accepted full responsibility for, and then tries to make her pay his debt anyway...", "What if her career didn't work out? Yes, if he couldn't afford the loan, he shouldn't have taken it out...", "She wasn\u2019t fending for herself \u2014 she took out her own loans as well for undergrad. She could\u2019ve taken out more loans in her name very easily, but her dad took out a loan specifically allocated to help parents pay for some of their child\u2019s college expenses that legally cannot be in the child\u2019s name or reassigned to the child later in life. Why would he take out this kind of loan specifically and then later expect her to pay it? He was under no obligation to take out a loan, much less THIS kind of loan, but he did. He made a promise he couldn\u2019t keep and any parent who take on this kind of debt and then try to shove it on their child is disgusting IMO", "No. And they could\u2019ve looked at different college options if taking 20K more on her name would\u2019ve been too much for her. Families make trade off decisions like this all the time. \n\nWhat parents shouldn\u2019t do is take out a loan that they committed to pay and expect the child to take over without consent.", "Immoral for a parent to not take out a loan for their child\u2019s college education? Of course not, many American parents cannot afford to pay a dime to their child\u2019s college through no fault of their own. But OP\u2019s dad took out a loan specifically for parents and not children, when he was a full adult and OP was a teenager, so he\u2019s on the hook.", "Yes, yes I do.", "Even though, why should OPS Dad feel proud of the benefit of the child when OP labeled him a racist and \u201cAnti-Woke\u201d (whatever that means) if he wasn\u2019t ever involved with OP, I wonder the conversation that was had to get him to help pay such a large amount of the schooling. Just curious how that all went down and if the expectations of repayment were ever discussed", "Yeah, after viewing OPS profile, I stand by my comment. OP is full of crap. They\u2019re not in Grad school. But in the profile, still working a regular job and now contemplating law school. This story is all fake", "too bad this story is fake based off OP profile and previous posts", "It wasn't a favor. It was a gift. You don't charge someone for a gift you give them. When you take one of these loans out it is made abundantly clear that YOU are in debt, not the student. OP has a mortgage and grad school costs to pay and Dad wants her to pay his debts, too? I don't know anyone who can afford all that and still provide for the future.", "I was just expanding on that with my own experience? Don't know that it's forbidden.", "do you guys even have empathy or a bit of thankfulness? If she can afford it and the father cannot, what is the problem in paying it. And who did he take the loan for? The father must regret sending her daughter to college", "You can't always \"easily\" get more loans. Neither my brother or myself graduated in the 2010s because our parents couldn't get Parent Plus loans and my grandparents couldn't get approved any longer to co-sign with us.", "She may not have been able to take out more. The government only allows so much for a semester and it can be hard to get a private loan for education without a parent cosigning. YTA", "Well he screwed up then. He should have known what kind of person he failed to raise, and certainly should not have tried to help her out by taking out a loan he couldn\u2019t afford. Some kids aren\u2019t worth it. Like father like daughter, I guess.", "There is no magic way to tell the government to give your kid more money - you won\u2019t be paying.  Unfortunately they usually have to wait until\nThey are 24 and declared an independent by the government or meet other qualifications to be independent", "Lol, OP literally stated she could afford it with her Spouse. That\u2019s why she was able to go back to school. Are we reading the same post? And OP even said they wouldn\u2019t have to pay until 6 months after Grad school. Come on man, be better", "https://reddit.com/r/LSAT/s/1DezS1QcZn\n\nOP is full of crap, apparently OP has a full time job, still, and is considering law school.

Who are benefiting you.", "She hasn't even paid off her own debts yet, why should she pay off his?\n\nHe took on a loan which is explicitly for parents to take on some of the burden, and it can't be transferred over to the children for that exact reason.\n\nHe knowingly and willingly took on a loan to give to his child, with no intention of being paid back. That's a gift. You don't give a gift to your child (or anyone) and then demand it back later.", "Aren\u2019t you a horribly judgmental and critical person\u2026 yikes.", "Jesus dude, triggered much", "You can do it but it takes effort. Plus you cannot take them as a dependent (OP's parents are ignoring the $$ that saved them).", "He is only asking it because atm he is unable to pay back. Also, who would he go to if he is in financial issues? His family. Not to forget that the daughter wouldn't be here if not for the loan\n\nAlso, OP is a horrible child to have. Instead of saying she doesn't want to pay back, she is validating herself by saying that her father wasn't a good one. But no father takes a 20k loan to educate their child who they don't even care about.", "OPS parents weren\u2019t together. Why didn\u2019t Mom help?
