All I knew about my sperm donor growing up was that he wasn\u2019t in our lives and my mom would get really quiet and tense anytime he was brought up so I stopped asking.  She had problems and we didn\u2019t always get along, but I know she loved me and did her best. She died last year and I still don\u2019t even know why exactly, no one would tell me. I have to wait to 18 to go look for the paperwork I guess.\n\nAfter she died, I had to go somewhere and my mom\u2019s parents were already gone, so they ended up tracking down my bio-father and sending me to him. I really, really didn\u2019t want that but nobody listened, so that\u2019s where I am now. He\u2019s married and has two kids (8,6). Nice house. Kind of a perfect stock photo family. It makes me mad tbh. He and his wife were all smiles starting out, but I heard his wife on the phone one time right after I moved in saying that she was worried I\u2019d be a bad influence on her kids because of how I grew up and how sullen I am. So I keep quiet and mostly stay in my room. Bio-father keeps trying to get me to do family things with them and talk, but I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to be here and I know his wife doesn\u2019t want me here and he could have talked to me years before now if he wanted. I don\u2019t want to get to know their kids, I just want to get through the next three years and go.\n\nIt turned into a problem because it was 8yo\u2019s birthday last weekend and they were having a party at this indoor playground place. I didn\u2019t want to go, but they made me because family, so I just found a place to sit and read. One of the moms of the other kids started talking to me and asked me if I was 8yo\u2019s big sister that just moved in and I said no. She must have told my bio-father, because he came over and asked why I told someone I wasn\u2019t related and I said because I\u2019m not. He said his kids were my siblings and he was my dad and I said he was my foster parent, my dad skipped out before I was born. He was quiet for a minute and walked away.\n\nLater, his wife told me I should apologize and a lot of kids in my position would kill to have a parent who actually wanted them.

In fact, the way he is now acting makes me think he wanted you in his life. He wants you to be part of his family, wants the other kids to think of you as family, wants you there for family events, etc.\n\nGiven step moms comments, I think your mother may have been the problem. And if no one is telling you how she died, it means it's nothing that would most likely reflect well on her memory to her child.\n\nI don't think you're the AH because you went through something traumatic, and adjusting to a new home can be hard, but even in your own writing, it sounds like they are *trying* to open up their lives for you to be a part of them.", "NTA.\n\nYou're a child who's hurt.  That sucks.  I cannot begin to tell you how sorry I feel for you.  Life served you up @#$@# pie and you were forced to eat it.  You deserve to be sullen and mad.\n\nThat doesn't have to be the rest of your life though.  It sounds like your dad really does want you in his life.  He wouldn't be pushing for you to be \"part of the family\" if he didn't love you.  He probably is broken inside because of the time he missed with you.  Doesn't make it right, but it does mean there is hope for you and him.  I HIGHLY recommend you get some alone time with him and tell him about your pain.  Tell him you need some one on one time with him to work things out and see if you can get him away from the others.  He needs to hear you, and I hope he does because he can start making it up to you if he understands what's wrong and you both want to make it right.\n\nYour \"step-mom\" is probably right.  You probably are lucky to have your dad, but they need to understand that you're missing a lot of information.  I bet there's a story behind why your dad wasn't there.  I also bet there is a story behind why you don't know what happened to your mom.  If the reason is what I think it is, your dad thinks he's doing you a favor by keeping you in the dark.  I doubt he is protecting himself.\n\nI would tell your dad what you overheard his wife saying and let him know that is one of the main reasons behind why you don't feel part of the family.  It will likely cause a fight, but F'her.  Your dad's #1 priority should you, not his wife.  Let him fix that part if he's man enough.  Honestly, how he reacts to hearing what his wife said will tell you everything you need to know.", "I'm so sorry for your loss sweetie absolutely NTA.\n\nYou've done nothing wrong. It's normal and okay to feel the way that you do. You lost your only parent and got shipped off to strangers and while it sounds like they have good intentions, it's very clear they do not have any idea how to help someone that's suffered trauma. \n\nThey are trying to force relationships that you aren't comfortable with.\n\nIt sounds like you don't really know what happened to your mom, and why your dad wasn't around. Why don't you ask him? Maybe you can let him know that you don't know him and he isn't your dad. Maybe one day you can warm up him, maybe you won't. Both options are okay.\n\nI wish you the best sweetie. Your feelings are valid, you're allowed to feel however you need to. Never feel guilty on how you feel. Do your best to be kind to this family, but if they don't respect your boundaries it's okay to set them firmly. It's unfair you have to be the \"adult\" with them.

Wtf", "NTA.\n\nWhat your bio-dad's wife said here...\n\n>a lot of kids in my position would kill to have a parent who actually wanted them\n\n... is laughable, in a not very funny way.\n\nDo you have any evidence that he wanted to be in your life before your mom passed? It does not sound like it.\n\nDoes he have an explaination for why he wasn't there before? Well... he has to have one.... Technically, he might even have a reasonable one (like not knowing of you before recently) ... however, if he had a good explanation, he should have given it right away.\n\nThat he hasn't suggests that he knows its not good. (yes, maybe he's been trying, but if so he needs to just up and say it)\n\nEven if he does want you now, 15 years of not being there is a massive hurdle to overcome.\n\nAnd whether or not he wants you there, it is understandable that you wouldn't want to be there. Not when the reason you're there is that both your mom and the grandparents you did know are gone.\n\nHis wife's comment about you being \"sullen\". Of course you're sullen. You don't know these people from Adam, and you're only there because your family is gone. Though \"sullen\" is probably not the right word. The right word is \"grieving\". And there is no right timeline on how long that will take.\n\nWhich comment you absolutely need to tell them you're aware of. Whether or not he wants you there, it sounds clear that she does not.\n\nIf she wants you to be happy and that you want to be there, or even just pretending that you are, then she needs to pull the log out of her eye, so that she can see that you're a grieving young woman who's lost her family and needs the time and space to heal. Cause that speck in your eye that she's complaining about sure looks more like tears from this distance.\n\nThe only other piece of advice I will give...\n\nConsider putting forth a bargain with them. You'll be more open to \"talking\" with your bio-dad, if they back off on including you in family events. And I put \"talking\" in quotes because right now I suspect what he's been wanting and trying to do is to get you to open up and talk to him... Which is the opposite of what he should be doing at this point.\n\nHe should be the one talking. Telling you about himself. His life growing up. How he met your mom. At least broad strokes of what their relationship was like and how it fell apart. Not to air the dirty laundry or badmouth her. But just so that you can get a picture of who he was that led to 15 years of him not being there.\n\nEssentially, if he wants you to share your life with him, he needs to be willing to share his life with you. If he's willing to do that, without any expectation of you sharing with him, please take the time to listen.\n\nIf nothing else, it may be a way to help you learn more about your mom and her life before you came along that you might not be able to learn otherwise.\n\nI can guarantee that no matter how much she might have told you, there are things she both wasn't going to share, and things that she wouldn't have thought to. Your bio-dad may or may not want to share any of the former either, but you do not know what he may have stored away of the latter. Or if there is any way you might ever learn them except through him.", "ESH\n\nYou need therapy, for yourself and with your father and with your family.", "NAH - You have three years until you are an adult.

If not, please try to seek one out, possibly apologize to bio-dad and say that you really need someone (not family) to talk to about these things.\n\nTake care, and remember that these people stepped up, not everyone does, and that matters.", "I think i seen this movie", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your choice.  If they turn out to be monsters, write again and we will give you more ideas.\n\nEdit to add:  please do as the others suggest and talk to them and ask questions.", "I think it\u2019s time to tell your \u201cdad\u201d what his wife said.\n\nYou don\u2019t deserve that kind of judgement from a woman who allowed her husband be an absentee father in the child he help create. She helped contribute to him being a deadbeat.", "Seriously. I've never heard someone say that people were hiding the cause of death and not find out later out was drunk driving or overdose. \n\nBetween what the step mom said and that, I'm guessing that the mother had substance issues and kept the kid away. I could be wrong, but I've seen it a lot and those kids always grow up hating the father for \"abandoning\" them, when the reality is the complete opposite.\n\nEdit to add: NAH because it sounds like OP is missing key facts about their childhood, and has recently experienced some very real trauma,  and the father and step mom are genuinely making an effort.", "Have you asked your bio father why he left?", "If any with thede people, they would be half siblings. But that no mean they are family. You have the right to not want to get to know them", "That's a choice you're making. IMO you're making yourself miserable but either way then kids didn't do anything to you.  You can say whatever you want but doesn't change facts.", "I know op is young but I kinda hope this gets an update after they sit down and lay it all out or not.", "OP, please ask your dad to go out just the two of you, tell him what you overheard, and also tell him you're old enough to know -- why was he out of your life for so long? The truth, however painful, is better than lies.", "YTA because you aren\u2019t helping the situation. You\u2019re a child, you don\u2019t know the details of your mom and dad\u2019s relationship, you only know what she told you. Maybe he did look and couldn\u2019t find you or she screamed at him to stay away. You\u2019re there now, give it a chance. Spend time with your dad and get to know him. You should also tell him what your step mom said and that it hurt your feelings. It sucks that your mom died, it sucks that you were uprooted to a new place, but you don\u2019t need to make it miserable.", "NTA", "Your sperm donors wife is correct lots of kids would kill to have a parent who wants them. HOWEVER, if your sperm donor had wanted you, he would have been around for the last 15 years.", "You deserve you feeling, but you must remember :\n\n**You don't know what was story behind his leaving** \n\nMoving forward, you can continue as now, being miserable and making every one else miserable for the next 3 years\n\nOr you just ask him what happened \n\nAnd from everything you said, it does not seems like they don't want you, only worried on how things will develop \n\nsoft YTA", "He could have had his name written in the father section part of the birth certificate by someone else filling out the paperwork and no one told him.", "You need to get more answers. Your mum never explaining why he left is a red flag. Them not telling you how she died is another red flag.\n\nI get that you are traumatized and full of angst, but don't cut off your nose to spite your face.\n\n~ saying this as someone with an utter demon of a father, but I only know this because I got to know him as an adult.", "Don\u2019t worry OP, those three years will go by soon enough. Just continue doing what you\u2019re doing, be polite to sperm donors children & try to get a job. You\u2019re prob gonna need dad to sign on to the account. Once that\u2019s done, save, save, save. Make sure your grades are top notch too. If you\u2019re in America, you\u2019re prob gonna have to pay for college yourself so study hard for scholarships. Good luck.", "She's 15, her mum died last year, she doesn't feel welcome in this house full of strangers, but tell me again how her misery is a choice.", "Good golly. OP is 15. She\u2019s lost her mother.  She\u2019s stuck in a situation that can make her grief even harder. And you keep harping on her about biology.", "NAH, except for his wife.\n\nI'd sit down and talk to him about why he left; if he even left at all. Your mom said he didn't want kids, yet he continued to have two. Your mom would get quiet about the mention of your dad.\n\nFor all we know, maybe she never told him about you. Maybe they had had a prior conversation and he said he didn't want kids and when she found out she was pregnant, left him without telling him about you.\n\nThere's a lot of different ways this all could have gone down; and it's all speculation until you get some answers. Talk to him. Ask him to go out of the house with you and get some privacy where you two can just talk.\n\nSee about therapy; maybe you can even do it with him. You both have a lot of feelings right now, and I don't think any of them are wrong. But a chance to get them out and work through them would be helpful to you.", "Wow. So much hate ion here\u2019 maybe you need a different platform.\n\nYTA. Typical selfish teen, a menacing presence. but you have been through a very hard time. You\u2019re not alone and you have someone who loves you, AND a family. You can\u2019t choose your family.

It\u2019s actually ridiculous you called this child a soft ah as if they weren\u2019t just forced to live with this man who never cared about them after their mother died.

He abandoned his child and never once tried to speak to them and now suddenly is acting like he\u2019s a dad to this child?\n\nDo you know that for a fact? \nThe information that we have is that:  \n1. OP father he was simply not there for her. \n2. Once OP move in with him he made efforts to include her in his family \n\nOP does not know the reason father was not present because her mom did not tell her;  so don't make assumptions \n\nThe important thing is how OP's life will go forward, and that depends on her; not only her, but she needs ti make an effort as well"]}
