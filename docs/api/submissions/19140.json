The kids (15f, 12m,9m) lived mostly with their father before he passed. The bf openly ignored their father at family events, only talks about himself, doesn't have friends of his own and says he has no family. He says he works a lot and I admit he drives a flashy car but he always tries to talk the group out of doing anything he deems expensive no matter the occasion.\n\nThe real issues started about a year ago when he started staying over there more. The house changed for him, a weekend guest. The thermostat went from 72 to 78. 78 isn't entirely uncommon in our hot state, but niece started puberty kind of late and has had hot flashes for the better part of two years. She took to cold water baths after the thermostat went up. He's got a half shelf of stuff in the fridge non of the kids can have but if niece buys something with her own money and it's not kept in her room he'll snack on it, etc.\n\nNow sister and bf are talking about moving in together. \n\nIt might be important to point out that not only do we live in a hot state, our family grew up swimmers and running around in our swim suits. We're very comfortable with each other in swim attire or even covered similarly. \n\nNiece called me in shambles a week ago because the bf, wh she didn't know was over, was in the kitchen when she went to get a snack in shorts and a sports bra and her mother's boyfriend told her since he was moving in she was going to have to start covering herself decently. She's never considered it indecent and neither does our family, her mother \"tried explaining\" to the bf but he doesn't want to hear it.\n\nThe worst part is kiddo just started getting breasts and they're already coming in strong. So now she feels like if she doesn't walk around her house in a moomoo or a sweater her likely soon to be stepfather will be staring at her chest. \n\nIt has caused a LOT of family issues, that came to a head last night when niece said she was going to apply for emancipation when she turns 16 and all hell kind of broke loose. Everyone was yelling over each other but I swear I heard the bf say slut, he denies it. \n\nAfter things cooled down a bit I approached my sister who assured me she still wants bf to move in. I pointed out that I have a second bedroom and that niece has great grades and could Lilley qualify at a highly sought magnet near my house and that maybe it would be smart to let her come stay with me for a bit to hopefully avoid all the legal stuff. Sister kicked me out of her house.\n\n\nThis morning I got texts from both my sister and her boyfriend about how I'm sticking my nose where it doesn't belong, but I don't think my sister is actually considering my niece's feeling here. \n\n\nAITA for offering to have my niece live with me?", "created_utc": 1686065611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142jqqk/aita_for_suggesting_my_niece_come_live_with_me/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All of this should have been discussed with the kids as the relationship progressed. Him sexualizing her wearing swim wear is creepy and again, out of line. Your nice is so lucky to have you advocating for her. Your sister needs to take off the rose-colored glasses and listen to her kids. I hope she does stay with you, she needs it.
