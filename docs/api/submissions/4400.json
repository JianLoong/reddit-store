Husband decided he wanted food, turned into this whole thing of us basically waiting around while husband & Little Bit ate instead of going ahead (I have Celiac Disease & BFF has food allergies, so fast food is not an option for us. We had packed food in our car). Her Husband likes to stay together when driving separately\u2026which I felt was unnecessary since she wasn\u2019t alone in the car, but he was feeling stressed because Little Bit\u2019s parents are unstable drug addicts who have made threats & just permanently lost legal & physical custody and can only have supervised visitation, so he was being extra vigilant. We were all tired & and dealing with that mind numbing fatigue that you get from the relief of closure after years of stress. She was inside with Little Bit using the bathroom & I took that time to call  my husband to get out my frustrations about how we could be 30 freaking minutes closer to home, but *noooooooooo* we had to wait. I called hubby so I could get it all out and he could talk me off the dramatic emotional cliff I was on. I was irrationally angry & I needed a reality check. It kept me from unloading on my BFF & hurting her. **That\u2019s what people do when they love each other**\n\nSide note, are there any activities or something she can when y\u2019all are at work?

You know what would\u2019ve avoided this entire situation? If the cry baby didn\u2019t open her mouth. She\u2019s a grown ass adult who can\u2019t control her emotions. Get fucking real. She needs therapy and to grow the fuck up", "She was talking about your wife being a bad host. How is that treating her nicely. Your mom sounds exhausting. I honestly hope your wife leaves you. You\u2019re kind of pathetic", "Lol she do that with everyone. That why everyone is so fearful to have a conversation with her. Backstories matter.", "If she is so sad because she's bored and misses her husband and clearly having free reign of their house while they are at work all day isn't good enough, then why did she, a grown woman, even make the trip. She sounds insufferable. I have no pity for people who whine about being bored. You aren't bored, you're boring. Find something to do instead of cry about it.", "So she doesn't just cry...she has rage issues. Wow. Glad this isn't my problem or someone I work with. Screaming bloody murder at work to the point someone is afraid is a form of verbal assault. Hopefully that shit skips some generations and your progeny doesn't inherit this trait.", "But she wasn't alone she was on the phone to her husband", "Constant need for attention? She\u2019s making drama because she\u2019s bored, like she\u2019s a toddler. And she was not alone, she was talking to your father. What does your father says about all that drama? Isn\u2019t he bored?", "Because all MILs are EVIL and everyone should immediately go NC with them!\n\n(At least as per most people in this sub).", "She called them sucky hosts so yes that's insulting them and it doesn't matter if it was to their faces or not", "She came because she hadn't seen me in two years and hadn't met one of our kids. I'm sure she loves me and thought it was worth the sacrifice. She is willing to pay but there isn't much to do around here and we are tired after work and have kids who need to get to bed on time", "I think mom is an adult who knew what she was getting into when she ASKED to visit, and can make her own decisions.", "If boredom (which is what Op's mom said), is a reason to not visit family, many won't. She is human enough to feel bored", "She is her dad's trophy child. He doesn't really care about the fits as long as she wins shit for him to brag about. My dad didn't really care about her. Her husband doesn't seem to think this is a big deal. He's even told me the fits don't last long and she's a very happy person in between.\n\nShe is a pianist and composer\n\nIt is more people outside of the family convincing her not to take meds, and her dad and husband enabling so she doesn't have to. Her husband just doesn't seem to have the best perspective. He actually told her that he doesn't care about money and she could stop and be a housewife if she wanted to, he'd take care of her, but he's concerned she won't be happy if she takes the meds.", "She has anxiety and I'm like 90% sure she's been officially diagnosed with ADHA. No idea what was wrong with her dad but he was much worse than she ever was. Unfortunately she has been told taking the meds will kill her career, so like always she picks career over people", "It's so expensive and she can afford it much more easily plus her job is way more flexible. It's also a lot to travel with kids and have them out of their routine and all the stuff we have to lug", "> where you have been taught your entire life, and shown by example by the other adults around her, that your mum should always be coddled and never ever called out or meet any resistance from anyone. \n\nMy dad screamed at her, mocked her, and on more than one occasion poured water on her during those fits. I chose to live with him after the divorce and he freely shit talked her.", "Because you\u2019ve misread the post and are saying something untrue to support your judgment. It is understandable that someone might not be comfortable with a relationship/visit and privately admit it to their spouse. It is absolutely unforgivable to rant the same info at your host.", "I wish she didn't say that, but I also believe your spouse is the one person you are supposed to tell absolutely everything. I've definitely told my wife things that I would be mortified if were overheard.", "Who is afraid of her? No one seemed at all afraid. Her manager was kind of laughing at her and her assistant was just casually feeding her. To be fair these people are paid extremely well, and she wasn't screaming at anyone. It was more like just shrieking like a toddler throwing a fit.", "You should be able to tell your spouse absolutely anything", "Exactly. Imagine someone making you watch them crying their eyes out because - they\u2019re bored. I\u2019d question sanity of that person.", "He isn't my father and he hasn't talked to me in years. No, he isn't bored. Maybe mildly annoyed but she does snap out of these bouts quickly and he has never seemed phased by it. I'm not sure how she was making drama by having a private conversation with her husband.", "Well someone is visiting, you\u2019re gone all day leaving her alone without even suggesting any activities surely makes you a sucky host", "Then mom has no right to complain that her son and his wife are bad hosts. After his wife told him what she heard, he should have told his mother she could leave if she was unhappy - no hard feelings.", "I am so sad for your mother. Fucking hell. Hope she gets at least therapy.", "I am sure there are meds that wont affect her playing. has she ever experimented with any? i took anxiety meds and they had very mild side effects, wouldnt have even noticed them if the doctor hadnt asked. may be worth her taking some time from work to try them out!", "> She is her dad's trophy child. He doesn't really care about the fits as long as she wins shit for him to brag about. My dad didn't really care about her. Her husband doesn't seem to think this is a big deal. He's even told me the fits don't last long and she's a very happy person in between.\n\n> Who is afraid of her? No one seemed at all afraid.

It was more like just shrieking like a toddler throwing a fit.\n\nBut you also have this. I assume your grandfather was around since you were very young, perhaps from the moment you were born? And your mother has treated employees like that as long as she's employed people, and your responses show you think its fine because they get paid well and could just quit if they don't like it?\n\nI'm not saying you should actually bother to confront your mother, at this point its too late for that, and as she doesn't live with you, you wife and children aren't constantly exposed to it.\n\nBut the invalidation and intolerance of your wife's feelings seems very unfair and hypocritical. I can't blame her for being angry with both your mother and you after you said she was overreacting.", "Bahhahahahaa....what an elitist comment. These ppl are paid well so they can feed my mother and watch her have meltdowns. I am way too entertained \ud83e\udd23", "If that\u2019s the case then your wife too should be able to tell you absolutely everything.", "You definitely should be able to tell your spose absolutely anything. My husband is my sounding board,and like I said in an above comment, I am a crier. I cry for just about anything and everything. I am an overly emotional person, and crying is a release of my emotions, but I haven't ever cried because I was bored. Either your wife is downplaying the conversation she overheard, or your mother is making a big deal out of nothing and is making herself cry for the attention/pitty or trying to paint you and your wife as the bad guys and her the victim.", "Agreed, I am a crier. I cry when I am happy, sad, mad, fuck sometimes I cry just to cry. I have done this since I was a kid....but I have never cried because I was bored.", "Him being almost a strangermakes thing even worse. Just the fact she snaps out fast is a signal she\u2019s faking or is a spoiled brat, sorry but that\u2019s not normal. Anyway, I\u2019d be extremly annoyed by adult tantrums in my house. I think your wife was tolerant to that point. It\u2019s up to you really.", "Oh sorry I didn't realise his mom needed a babysitter, they went to work that's not being a bad host.", "Or they could just you know quit, but that is the job they signed up for.", "Which i encourage but it doesn't mean I have to go confront my mother. My mom's husband didn't call us up and tell us how she felt.", "So only the things you cry about are valid and because you (who claims to cry about just about anything) have never cried about being bored, no one is allowed to? My mom has insatiable to begin with and having nothing to do all day is going to be torture for her. I'm sure you wouldn't like people dissecting why you are crying.", "When you see someone once a while, and you know that person is coming, you make an effort to be available to spend time with them, especially if they mean something to you.", "Yo... I need to see this job description for science. Lol, pay your wife \ud83e\udd23... she doesn't have to put up with this", "She has mental health issues... This is something that should have been stated in the main post. Having a mental health crisis is a completely different ballgame to someone crying just because. \n\nAnd no, not everything I cry about is valid. Some of it is downright irrational, but I know that, and I have gone to the doctors to receive help with my mental and physical health. To help me control the crying outbursts and I have drastically reduced and been helped to regulate and manage my emotions like other people do without thought. Because crying all the time over little issues is detrimental to living. \n\n\nIf being alone all day is a trigger for her, then more care should have been thought out for her visit. \n\n- A shorter duration\n- bring a companion\n- you take vacation time to spend with her so she isn't alone all the time. \n- events planned (site seeing, dinners, walks etc)\n\nI can understand your wife's frustration in this situation, especially because this seems to happen often being around someone who breaks down in tears over everything is emotionally draining.", "not everyone has the luxury to take time off of work in America. And Mom is a grown woman, she make her own plans for the day knowing OP is going to be out of the house.\n\nit doesn't even sound like mom wants to be there, so why is she bothering?", "So you're saying OP doesn't care about his Mom? So OP is an asshole, good to know.", "That\u2019s exactly what it boils down to.", "Well there ya go OP YTA"]}
