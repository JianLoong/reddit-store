Either an extra vehicle, public transportation, something? Since these visits are rare were you 2 not able to take some time off (even if just a day or two) to maybe do some things together?

Husband decided he wanted food, turned into this whole thing of us basically waiting around while husband & Little Bit ate instead of going ahead (I have Celiac Disease & BFF has food allergies, so fast food is not an option for us. We had packed food in our car). Her Husband likes to stay together when driving separately\u2026which I felt was unnecessary since she wasn\u2019t alone in the car, but he was feeling stressed because Little Bit\u2019s parents are unstable drug addicts who have made threats & just permanently lost legal & physical custody and can only have supervised visitation, so he was being extra vigilant. We were all tired & and dealing with that mind numbing fatigue that you get from the relief of closure after years of stress. She was inside with Little Bit using the bathroom & I took that time to call  my husband to get out my frustrations about how we could be 30 freaking minutes closer to home, but *noooooooooo* we had to wait. I called hubby so I could get it all out and he could talk me off the dramatic emotional cliff I was on. I was irrationally angry & I needed a reality check. It kept me from unloading on my BFF & hurting her. **That\u2019s what people do when they love each other**\n\nSide note, are there any activities or something she can when y\u2019all are at work?

It doesn\u2019t mean you should have confronted your mom, but you definitely should have validated your wife and let her feel heard.", "So when you are there, she pretends to be fine but in reality she's miserable? And you're ok with that?", "Theyre not mutually exclusive - she can still want to see her kid (OP), miss her spouse, and be bored. People are capable of more than one emotion at a time.", "Well.... She didn't really.\n\nShe just had a bit of a moan to her husband when she thought she was on her own.\n\nHad she said anything to son & daughter-in-law I might agree with you.  Or I might tell everyone to put their big girl / boy pants on & work together to find a compromise.\n\nEvery situation has an optimum achievable outcome, and I don't see why they shouldn't strive for it.", "She vented to her husband in private since she thought she was 100% alone. I think we are all guilty of privately venting to someone when we are in an unexpectedly bad/tense situation. I know I have. That doesn't make her an emotional wreck.", "She had a private conversation with her husband in what she thought was an empty house.  She has been an otherwise gracious guest.  And the crying appears to be caused by a genetic disorder.  \n\nWhats with the uncharitable take here?", "I suspect the issue may be that she has a genenetic disorder that is neurological in origin.  The medications used to treat it may come with side effects that could permanently impair her playing abilities.  And then there may be menopause transition in that mix along with anxiety and ADHD (per OP).... \n\n\nWhat a horrible, horrible spot to find yourself in.  Wish I could give OP's mom a hug.  And a stiff drink.\n\nWas fully prepared to declare OP the asshole based on the opening lines, but this is definitely NTA territory.", "sorry I mean ADHD", "I don't have unlimited time off like she does (she commits to projects as she wants them) I have responsibilities she can't understand as she always had hired help. I can't accommodate her at the moment. I'm sorry she is sad though and she is entitled to those feelings as long as she isn't lashing out at us", "umm no she said we are sucky hosts. totally different and to be fair if someone was visiting her they would be getting much better treatment than she is currently getting. We aren't going to change our lives to accommodate her, but she is allowed to think we aren't good hosts", "Of course, obviously, but if she's having severe crying spells perhaps it's best to call an end to the visit for her mental health. Plus I'm pretty sure the wife would have no problem with MIL leaving. Why stay when leaving would pretty much solve everyone's problems?", "Thank you for your comment. Most interesting.\n\nI really hope OP's mom is getting the support she needs.", "I'm an author, and I'm medicated. I'm happy, productive, and creative. Especially since I'm not distracted by my anxiety and can focus to work. Misery doesn't always equal great art.", "This is getting worse. Please let your mum go home. She clearly wants to but doesn't feel she can for some reason. I'm getting increasingly sure that reason is your expectations of her in some way. When you're there, she pretends to be fine but now you know she isn't. I was joking when I said are you holding her hostage, but something is holding her there when she wants to go home.", "Right, OP knows his mom is A LOT TO TAKE. Like, a A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT and has always been A LOT TO TAKE. \n\nBut doesn't take off work, doesn't make plans to entertain her, doesn't run any interference whatsoever?\n\nAnd Mommy freaks out, which upsets Wife, but Wife is the bad guy. \n\nBecause Mommy can be an emotional wreck whenever and wherever but Wife has to be perfectly composed at all times, I guess?\n\nFine, the mom has some kind of health issue. But it's OP's job to keep things humming instead of just expecting everyone to tolerate it.", "huh, I'm not anyone's boss. She was the boss and they were her personal assistants. Most of them had been around in the industry and didn't seem to phased by her, and taking care of her personal needs actually was there job description", "Where in the heck did this reach come from?  The comment said that people can't afford to take off of work (in the us) and that his mother doesn't even sound like she wants to be there (not that op doesn't want her there) and your conclusion is that op is that ah?  \n\nWhere is your logic?  I'd love to know", "My mistake l, I thought you were replying to  different comment, I see what I did wrong!  My apologies!"]}
