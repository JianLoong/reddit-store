Either an extra vehicle, public transportation, something? Since these visits are rare were you 2 not able to take some time off (even if just a day or two) to maybe do some things together?

Husband decided he wanted food, turned into this whole thing of us basically waiting around while husband & Little Bit ate instead of going ahead (I have Celiac Disease & BFF has food allergies, so fast food is not an option for us. We had packed food in our car). Her Husband likes to stay together when driving separately\u2026which I felt was unnecessary since she wasn\u2019t alone in the car, but he was feeling stressed because Little Bit\u2019s parents are unstable drug addicts who have made threats & just permanently lost legal & physical custody and can only have supervised visitation, so he was being extra vigilant. We were all tired & and dealing with that mind numbing fatigue that you get from the relief of closure after years of stress. She was inside with Little Bit using the bathroom & I took that time to call  my husband to get out my frustrations about how we could be 30 freaking minutes closer to home, but *noooooooooo* we had to wait. I called hubby so I could get it all out and he could talk me off the dramatic emotional cliff I was on. I was irrationally angry & I needed a reality check. It kept me from unloading on my BFF & hurting her. **That\u2019s what people do when they love each other**\n\nSide note, are there any activities or something she can when y\u2019all are at work?

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for your wife. I don\u2019t think you know just how much kids pick up on, and not just things said out loud. I think you\u2019re being naive thinking your mother can \u201csuck it up\u201d and your wife is just \u201coverreacting\u201d because she knows your mother is often hysterical. \n\nHere\u2019s the issue.

Yes obviously she does, but is that how you want her to express it? She\u2019s hurting clearly, she\u2019s always done it, getting hysterical and wailing. That\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not okay, and if it\u2019s truly a medical issue she has, she shouldn\u2019t be travelling far away from where she\u2019s actually happy for extended periods of time. That\u2019s just asking for her to suffer, and that\u2019s not how you should want her to love you. That\u2019s expecting her to be in pain for you. That\u2019s not love. \n\nFurthermore, it is incredibly stressful to be around someone this emotionally high strung. Even if she isn\u2019t directly sobbing in front of you, you can see she has been by her eyes. Your wife is probably feeling like she\u2019s in a tightrope expecting a flood of tears at any moment. That\u2019s not nice to be living with, not nice to hear that your guest thinks you\u2019re bad at hosting, and it\u2019s really hard to handle for a while. \n\nBasically what\u2019s happening is you think that everyone should just suck it up to do everything you need them to, for as long as you want. Not how your family feels, or how your mother feels. Just that she\u2019s here because she loves you, which is okay an all, but not at the expense of her mental health. Nor your wife\u2019s. \n\n\nPlease sort this issue in a better manner than you have been. You either need to take time off to actually be with your mother instead of her being alone constantly, and you need to do it out of your home.

It\u2019s all excuses anyway, you don\u2019t like her partner, her doesn\u2019t like you or you can\u2019t travel with the kids, and it\u2019s too expensive anyway. \n\nAll of those are reasons you don\u2019t want to make any concessions to make this visit possible AND comfortable.
