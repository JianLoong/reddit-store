We got back together last year and moved in very quickly to a joint rental. It was then I learnt what a lazy slob he is. \n\nThis man is the funniest, most charming and joyous human being but living with him is so hard. When I asked him to leave after six months earlier this year he moved back with his mum, who has also now kicked him out for being a slob and told him he has a month. I\u2019ve told him he\u2019s not moving back in with me, news he hasn\u2019t taken lightly. He has no money and no where else he can go. \n\nThere\u2019s untidy, and there is carnage. He is happy in carnage. I was working two jobs, paying for absolutely everything including our rent and bills, and cooking cleaning and shopping on top. He wouldn\u2019t do the bear minimum. Everything was a battle and it was so much easier to just do it myself. For example there are gates to my property - a constant row for us is when he leaves to shut the gates behind him because I feel safer at night when they are closed. They\u2019re just wooden drive gates but he absolutely refuses to and belittles me for wanting it done - I now have to do them myself if he visits and if he leaves at 1am it can be a scary experience. They take 30 seconds to close. It\u2019s the one job I\u2019ve asked of him. \n\nI\u2019m torn because over the last year I\u2019ve fallen in love with my high school sweetheart again but beyond him being difficult to live with there\u2019s been other issues. He dumped me just before my 30th birthday out of the blue and then two weeks later had a one night stand. We didn\u2019t talk for a month after the break up and when we reconnected he told me about it. I was devastated but agreed to work on the relationship again so long as he tried. A month back together and all the promises are long gone and it\u2019s back to nothing. I\u2019m in love with someone who just exists and doesn\u2019t live. All of my friends and even his family think I\u2019m mad for trying to pull this boulder up a hill but when we\u2019re together the big picture stuff doesn\u2019t really matter. He says he\u2019s in love with me, doesn\u2019t want to lose me and wants us to work on this relationship but when I try to talk to him about the above he is defensive and says he can\u2019t give me what I need. I don\u2019t need anything or ask for anything, other than for him to do his fair share. \n\nTo note, I\u2019m a much bigger earner than him and he has a child so me covering for us financially this past year ust made sense so he didn\u2019t struggle - I wanted him to get on his feet before contributing. He didn\u2019t tell me his mum had kicked him out, she did, when I asked him if he mum wanted him out he said it was because she had a row with her partner. He thinks both his mum and me are uptight and both in the wrong for kicking him out.

He will continue to take advantage of you until you draw a line. That line will likely lead to a break up, but, grrrrrrl, you can do SO MUCH BETTER. I know you love him, but he's the epitome of a selfish asshole.\n\nNTA", "NTA for not letting him move back in, but you are for ignoring everyone in your life telling you to get away from this narcissist.  He's never going to change; he's proven that he can't even do the tiniest thing for you and will even mock you or deride you when you ask him for anything.  You're not in love with him, you're in love with the man you thought he'd grow up to be when you were 15.  This is beyond nostalgia, because he never was the person that you're trying to convince yourself he is/could become.  You need to take off the blinders and cut him out of your life cold turkey.  You are worth more than what he will give you.", "1. he's shown you who he is. Believe him. He's a lazy mooch and slob. Those don't out weigh the positive qualities, as you've noticed. \n2. You can do better, and you can find someone who loves and supports you and also is a partner, not a child. \n3. Even if you never found anybody else, you'd be better without him. \n4. Don't go down that rabbithole again. \n\nNTA", "Why on earth are you still with this guy???? NTA for not letting him move back in, but YTA to yourself for not demanding more in a partner. Yeesh.", "NTA there seems to be a lot of manipulation going on here from what I've read. He moves in uses you and gets mad when you kick him out. He goes to his Mom and she too can't put up with his behavior and kicks him out. He thinks this will get you to take him back. You said he has a child, which again he is using as a way to get help from you. You said it made sense for you to pay more, but why YOU DON'T OWE HIM ANYTHING!!! You are supporting him and his child who is he supporting? \n\nSeems like this is a relationship you need to move on from. Sounds like you're stuck in the past and think he is the 14/15 yr old he was when you first met him. However time has passed and you're in your 30s you need an adult relationship, not one based on childhood fantasy.", "Ywbta to continue dating this man.", "NTA. Just run in the opposite direction from this guy. He is a slob, a lazy ass and a moocher. Don't ruin yr life for him.", "NTA\n\nLove isn't what a person says, but how they treat you.  And he treats you like a servant and an ATM.  \n\nDon't let him stay for any length of time.  And don't give, or lend, him a penny.\n\nAnd seriously consider whether you want to waste the next couple decades of your youth raising this spoiled child (meaning, the BF who doesn't financially support himself and isn't responsible in his home either).", "NTA!!! I\u2019m going to give you the oldest \u201cold person\u201d answer ever.\n\nI dated and married that guy\u2026 we divorced (and I was a single mom) by 25-26. Then I dated this younger guy with no baggage who cooked, cleaned and was \u201ctoo nice\u2026\u201d so I immediately wondered what was wrong (me, my history). I did therapy, we got married and had kids later in my life.\n\nNow I\u2019m an old mom dealing with perimenopause, ADHD and there are days I forget and put my underwear on backwards (I wear thongs!)!!! He laughs WITH me, has dealt with post-partum depression and all kinds of craziness and when he goes through stuff, I\u2019m there with him.\n\nYou do NOT need to mother someone who has chosen not to grow up and whose own mother has said \u201cOh HELL NO!\u201d to how he lives!\u2026 life throws some crazy curveballs and you need a partner, not a dependent.", "NTA. You need to move on.  It will be hard but bite the bullet and do it.  You are over 30 and he has shown you that he is not reliable, not honest, is dirty, is lazy, and is willing to have you pay all his bills for him.  At some point you will wake up and realize you have wasted so many years on a guy that doesn\u2019t respect you at all.  He may love you, idk, but he isn\u2019t capable of being a grown up.  \n\nSee a therapist to help get over him.  You will find someone that is much better!!", "In addition to the other clear points about leaving this guy, let me give you some perspective. My friend married a mooch, slob, and he was living in his car when they met.  He had a few moments in the early times when he was a caring partner but for the most part nope. She worked hard while he stayed home and played video games all day. Fast forward to several decades later, she's finally divorced him, and now he's going to get a chunk of her 401k and probably force her to sell the house and get half of that.  Do not, under any circumstances, proceed with a relationship with this guy. If it goes on long enough this is your future.", "NTA. A man who moves through the world fearing very little may not viscerally understand why you need your gates to be shut, but he'd know it was important and always do it. Absolutely REFUSING to do it and BELITTLING you for asking such a simple, basic thing of him...he shrugs off your safety and dismisses your fear, and that means he doesn't care about how you feel.", "NTA, but I would like to give you this advice.  You love the parts of him that you deal with when you don't live with him.  Basically you love parts of him and can't tolerate other parts.  You can only love a whole person or not.  Think about that in terms of if you see a future in this relationship. \n\nIt's easy for anyone to seem great when you only see their good sides.  Relationships don't work long term when you try to use elaborate plans to avoid seeing the deal breakers that are present in them.  Either he grows past this immature stage, which his mom probably cultivated, or it's a lost cause.", "NTA- don\u2019t let him back in .\n\nHe thinks it\u2019s a woman\u2019s job to\ntake care of him and he will bleed you dry financially.\n\n\nYou can do way better , OP.", "NTA but not very bright. Did you read your own post? The guy is not Mr Dreamy by a million miles why do you even give him the time of your day?!", "NTA, he can't give you what you need. His words not mind, so you need to move on from him. You two aren't teenagers anymore, but he still acts like one.", "> I\u2019m wondering if I fell in love with him again because he\u2019s still 15 years old at heart and our relationships nostalgic.\n\nSome posters wait until the very last sentence to be honest with themselves.\n\nBut let's be clear, here... There is much, much more going with this guy than simply being untidy or messy. It is not normal for someone to be \"happy in carnage\", that's indicative of something (likely multiple somethings) deeper going on.\n\nIn the interest of exhuming a buried lede, can you tell us more of the story between him and ex-he-has-a-kid-with (the fact he has a kid was merely an aside in the last paragraph of your post is bonkers, to me)? Nevertheless, NTA... The idea that closing a gate is too much to ask underlines what I said before that there is some disorder at play, as opposed to simple laziness. But none of these things with him are your problem. He needs to figure his shit out.", "His own mother doesn't want to live with him. NTA", "NTA", "No. Just...no. He doesn't want to work on this relationship, he wants YOU to. He may be charming but as a partner he's an asshole.", "NTA for not wanting him to live there, but I think you\u2019re holding on to something you need to let go.", "Nta, and ask you therapist to help you figure out why you think you deserve a shitty partner", "There are no advantages to staying with this guy.  He doesn\u2019t want to be a partner - he wants to act like a baby.  The biggest red flag for me is that he doesn\u2019t care about your safety or emotional well-being (the situation with the gate). NTA", "It says a lot about him when his own mother kicked him out.\nYou would be the asshole to YOURSELF if you invited the slob & freeloader back to your home.", "NTA. He has had 2 places he could have lived if he kept them tidy. Not your fault and this gives him an opportunity to be better for the next relationship.", "NTA. He\u2019s a lazy freeloader. He has a child but no home or job. His own mother threw him out.

Won\u2019t make you feel safe, loved, supported, accommodated, important. He won\u2019t do that for his child. He won\u2019t even do it for HIM. \n\nMaybe you two are made for each other, but I don\u2019t like either of you right now. So stay together, split up, idc.\n\nETA: your also as asshole for financially supporting him the last year so he doesn\u2019t have to work and screws over the mother of his child.", "Listen, if you really want to stay with this guy, you will need to live forever in 2 different homes with a strict rule about him never stocking anything at your place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut I don\u2019t see a future, you are paying for everything, cooking, cleaning, while he disregards your safety and mental health. He has a child that you will have to take care of, even his mother cannot bare him anymore. You already broke up, relationship very rarely survive after that.

If you don't you will keep dating lying, cheating jerks like him.", "So he doesn't pay bills, he doesn't clean up after himself, he's an adult and wouldn't close gates to keep you safe, he has no job or income and he belittles you for wanting to feel safe? He dumps you, sees other girls (you don't believe she was the first, do you? Really?)\n\nAnd you worked two jobs, paid for everything, including his kid by yet another woman, had to shout like a parent at their unruly teenager to get him to lift a finger for your sake? \n\nWhat exactly is so great about him? What makes him loving? Because none of what he does shows love, only egotism. He says he wants you (plural) to work on the relationship, but anyone who isn't blind can see he means you (singular). \n\nLady, idk why women do this to themselves. \n\nYou're N T A for making demands but you're a fool and ESH: him for using you, and you for letting him use you.", "NTA but damn you need to get some therapy so you can finally kick this guy for good.", "Omg, why are you still with this guy??\n\nSurely subscribing to a 24/7 comedy podcast would get you the laughs and none of the filth, disrespect and laziness.\n\nNTA for finally showing some sense and keeping him out of your space, YTA to yourself if you keep dating this individual. The big stuff matters and your love addled brain is acting like he's cocaine.", "NTA - Acually, you know this relationship is hard work. You chose this man. If you choose to keep him, you cannot complain, that he is lazy...", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut end the relationship, you have no future - unless you WANT the rest of your life to consist of paying for him, cleaning after him, and being his repacement mom.", "You would be doing yourself a *massive* disservice to stay with this awful person. He is a mooch and a cheat, what the hell does he have to offer?  Why doesn't he contribute? He clearly does not care about your comfort or feelings.  Being charming is ***not*** a good quality, it is a red flag for someone being manipulative.  Stop being an asshole to yourself and get rid of this shitty dude.", "Exactly OP definite gets a YTA from me just for doing this to themselves. Have some self respect in who you choose as a partner.", "See a therapist, seriously, helped me a lot not being a doormat. Otherwise you will be a doormat all your life, used to oblivion. Been there, never going back."]}
