I\u2019m not going to put blame solely on you as this has been a team failure and there\u2019s not enough information to establish whether this is down to resentment of having a step child and you wilfully drove a wedge or you whether were instructed to keep distance and not discipline her. What has her father been doing about her possessiveness? Did he ever get her help to process that her bio family isn\u2019t together? Even though she was 1, she would have grown up knowing her home situation is different, her parents aren\u2019t together and may have been jealous of friends home lives. \n\nBottom line is through lack of parenting between you, her father and her bio mother has turned her into a mean girl who lacks empathy, who will drive away from Maisie in pain to mock her.

If for example, Danielle pulled over to help and Maisie made a nasty comment at her and demanded a lift, Danielle would be perfectly entitled to drive away regardless of a sprained ankle.

If not, your experience sound much like what my bonus Sister (Best Friend) went through.  Her older sister bullied, tormented her all through childhood, teenage years and even as adults.  It finally took my friend until she reached the age of 51 to go NC with her sister.  She (BF) is the type of person who believed in \"Family\" and all that it is \"supposed\" to entail.  But no matter how she tried to be a sister to her older sister, she only got abused and used, so she finally stopped trying.", "Hey, another bot replied to you;  /u/Lawcdsqw is a scammer!  **It is stealing comments** to farm karma in an effort to \"legitimize\" its account for engaging in scams and spam elsewhere.

I don't believe Maisie did anything wrong, apart from existing, there are definitely kids that don't like sharing their parents. But, having in mind OP is in Danielle's life since 1 year old, and that's more than enough time to establish boundaries, expected behavior and be an actual parent figure, I really wonder if OP was allowed to make any corrections, regarding Danielle's behavior. Or was OP's husband like \"you are not allowed to parent my child, it's a decision between my ex and I\"?, only for him to not do anything really.  If that is the case, I'd definitely grow tired of it at some point.", "I wouldn't stay married to a man who allowed his child to mistreat her sister like that.", "OP is not the AH. The dad is the AH for not stepping in and disciplining his own daughter. It's not OPs responsibility to discipline her step-daughter because if she did, it will cause even more problems and likely make her act out even more. OP may not even feel like it's her place to do so, especially since it's apparent the dad is already not backing her.\n\nPlus, like you said, at no point in the post did she come across as saying her daughter did no wrong. She didn't even make a scene when the stepdaughter refused to take her daughter to school, so why would they think she's treating her daughter will special privileges? Idk how the majority came to the conclusion that OP is the AH, really blows my mind.", "Right!? That's malicious behavior. What's the point of stopping to ask just to drive off other than to taunt her?", "As someone who was literally in a group of people, like at least 7 people. I ended up paralyzing my leg when I was with 2 of them (one of them is the reason I paralyzed my leg) and then met up with the rest while I was barely able to walk and then when I didn\u2019t want to be there anymore, a 3 minute walk home turned into a 25 minute one because I could barely walk and NOBODY offered to take me home. We weren\u2019t even in a safe part of town, like our neighborhood was really sketchy and the one who knocked me over, causing my leg to be paralyzed, just sat and did nothing.\n\nEdit: forgot to finish this, yeah, step daughter needs to be dealt with. Knowing someone is hurt and not helping them is really mean and malicious. Obviously her parents need to do something, I feel bad for OP\u2019s daughter. That must have hurt to see someone you know drive right past you when you\u2019re injured and in pain.", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t do that with a stranger, much less my sibling, even if I didn\u2019t like them. At least call someone if you\u2019re gonna drive away", "Totally.

Such as \"thank God she's not mine\" or that \"I know Maisie is a better person\" so it makes you wonder what OP is telling them behind closed doors at home.

Her dad and I were going to counseling bi-weekly to deal with how we parent our kids. OP is NTA. Dad and Danielle are most certainly the AH.", "I think people are getting the vibe that OP isn't exactly a reliable narrator. The step daughter sounds cartoonishly evil from her POV. Also, she is the adult here and clearly has resentment and a lack of connection with this girl she helped raise since she was a literal infant. This family has separated the way the two girls are treated and it's hard to say where that is coming from as a reader. People tend to blame the adult in the situation by default. Also, I would guess many people saying those things grew up with step parent who favored their \"actual\" children, and had the golden child to deal with growing up.\n\nETA: This really seems like she is trying to ship the kid away instead of parent as others have mentioned. Nobody said parenting was easy, so you can't send them away when things get hard.", "Taunting her was Danielle's point. That's what she wanted to do.", "The cruelty was the point.", "Honestly, if I knew a kid that was willing to just leave their younger sibling injured on a sidewalk over just letting in them in the friggin car, I'd be thanking God they're not mine too. And if OP actually has been treating Danielle poorly compared to Maisie (which we know absolutely zero about one way or another), then that would be on OP, *not* Maisie.
