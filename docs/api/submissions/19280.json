I\u2019m not going to put blame solely on you as this has been a team failure and there\u2019s not enough information to establish whether this is down to resentment of having a step child and you wilfully drove a wedge or you whether were instructed to keep distance and not discipline her. What has her father been doing about her possessiveness? Did he ever get her help to process that her bio family isn\u2019t together? Even though she was 1, she would have grown up knowing her home situation is different, her parents aren\u2019t together and may have been jealous of friends home lives. \n\nBottom line is through lack of parenting between you, her father and her bio mother has turned her into a mean girl who lacks empathy, who will drive away from Maisie in pain to mock her.

If for example, Danielle pulled over to help and Maisie made a nasty comment at her and demanded a lift, Danielle would be perfectly entitled to drive away regardless of a sprained ankle. I\u2019m not necessarily accusing anyone of anything but it is possible that Maisie could have been repeatedly antagonising her and this was the result of how Maisie treats Danielle.

At 9 years it broke down, and since then she has caused harm to her step sister on other occasions too. I don\u2019t think it matters a bit if they\u2019re blood relatives or not, wanting to protect one family member from another being malicious is common sense.

She deserves to feel safe in her own home and I will not judge a mother for wanting to protect her child. Was suggesting Danielle live with her mom hasty? Maybe it was.

Someone is trying to make up for emotional neglect but it's too late.", "And that dad doesn't support OP also leads to more questions.", "So kicking her out will teach her not to abandon family? \n\nMaybe her Dad is compensating for the love she\u2019s missing from you\u2026idk you sound resentful and bitter.", "Except you really aren't teaching consequences very well by going to if you don't help a hurt person you get abandoned by your family.

Clearly something went wrong during their upbringing as siblings, really sad", "That\u2019s also the 17 year old who should know better who also abandoned her sister after making sure she was injured, if she\u2019s such a child why is she driving in the first place", "She is the typical popular girl at school and she is the top of her class so teachers favorite.\n\nShe doesn't get along with her mom though", "That 100%. and sometimes mental issues can pop up as kids get older.", "Then it\u2019s ESH judgement", "Several other things such as \u201cher awful behaviour started when she was 9\u201d and \u201cshe doesn\u2019t apologize\u201d as well as basically \u201cI don\u2019t get how she can be so awful to her siblings I\u2019ve never seen this before\u201d.
