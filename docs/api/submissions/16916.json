I told MIL to tell DD herself. I overheard DD's sarcastic response & it was something along the lines of, \"Oh, don't be sorry! Getting sticks out of your yard is far more important than my stupid concert! You stay right there & don't give me another thought. I won't bother asking you to come to my concerts at all in the future.\"  Then DD hung up & turned off her phone.

But she didn't call your MIL names, she didn't curse her out, she was snarky, yes, and she told her grandmother that she sees who she is and she's just not playing the game with her anymore. My guess is that your husband has dealt with this behavior from his mom all of his life and he just refuses to acknowledge the meaning behind it.

Explain dd\u2019s feelings are valid, you support her telling MIL she is hurt and will not ask her to apologize for her feelings or for communicating them.  Ask mil to apologize for her hurtful behavior.  Encourage dd to send grandma a letter explaining how hurt she is and asking mil to apologize.  MIL likely won\u2019t apologize, but I\u2019ve had people like this in my life and it feels really great to ASK.  Totally changed my thinking.  Finding the courage to ask for the apology the first time ( didn\u2019t get the apology, but I asked!) proved to me I could stand up for myself and I deserved the damn apology.  Made it easier to recognize the behavior and stop it quickly next time.  Now if a date is a hurtful AH, I demand the apology, I get the apology every time, then I dump the jerk.

He needs to back down on this and Protect His Children. That's what Father's are Supposed To Do!

It hurts to give examples about my DD, so here's one about her Dad, my Ex when we were still together. \nExample: On his Birthday one year, he (we) was surprised, when his mother didn't even bother to call him to wish him Happy Bday. Her oldest child, only son, only one of two children (not hard to remember your own 2 kid's Bdays) \nHe finally, late in the evening, called her. He said, \"Hi Mom\" MIL did say Happy Birthday. He said thank you, and said, \"I figured you might call me to wish Happy Bday\" Her response, \"You should call me, not the other way around, because I'm the Mom\" WTH! \ud83e\udd2c\nHe tried saying, \" But Mom, it's Not Your Birthday, it's My Birthday.

And that is very, very important.  \nIncidentally, our daughters had a similar situation - while my mother came to their special events and talked to each of her grandchildren about their interests, my husband's mother never even remembered their ages, and would ask them what grade they were in after they had finished their army service. Result: they visited my mother and brought the grandchildren to play on her carpet even when she was senile and feeble, and they wouldn't move an inch to see my husband's parents (my husband is fine with it). Becoming a grandmother by having grandchildren is one thing; being considered and treated as a grandmother is another, and has to be earned.", "Ok, fine. But just because the woman\u2019s retired, doesn\u2019t mean that she has to go to all the concerts etc. she might have a life, and that she wants to do things she did not have time to do before. \n\nAs to DD, she should do all these great things, but she should do them for herself, as in \u201cI practiced all these weeks/month, and it sounds glorious, we did an amazing job\u201d, not \u201cwhy didn\u2019t grandma come?\u201d Being self-aware and depending on herself are great traits.", "NTA and you are totally right. Respect goes both ways and must be earned. Good for teaching your daughter this, because your MIL's parents forgot to teach her that principle of life. Now look at her on her age using taking care of the yard as an excuse to jot go to her granddaughters concert. You don't want your daughter to end up like that.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter gets to be upset that grandma chose not to attend an event after committing to it.\n\nNext time grandma has an event your daughter can need to brush her hair.", "NTA.  Who is DH?!!   Your daughter stood up for herself. Her GRANDMOTHER should be the one apologizing. I can tell MIL will die alone and ignored.", "You rock, your daughter rocks, this supportive parenting rocks. \n\nSo many times families give toxic relatives grace and respect when they don't deserve it. And for what? Cause they happen to be older? No way, respect is earned and they fact that she can't be bothered to grace you all with her presence is ridiculous! \n\nUnless she has she has some sort of medical condition or phobia of places/people, she's just being neglectful and emotionally manipulative.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter if the MIL is a flake and a shitty grandmother. Someone\u2019s thoughtlessness, indifference, and yes, even rudeness never entitles you to be rude in return. Your daughter would have been justified in telling MIL she was disappointed, and it would have been understandable if she had just written her off and stopped inviting her, but lashing out with angry sarcasm was not appropriate. \n\nSo many people here, both OPs and commenters, have this very immature belief that if someone slights you, it gives you free reign to lash out and vent your spleen all over them, and believe if you don\u2019t do that, it is a sign of weakness and letting them \u201cwalk all over you.\u201d In reality, it is the big blowup that is weak, it\u2019s you letting them get you so mad at them that you lose your composure, you\u2019re giving them control of your emotions and behavior, and often they can use that to make you look like the irrational one. True strength is accepting that they\u2019re a limited person, shrugging your shoulders and walking away, wasting no more time or energy on them. It\u2019s someone with a very fragile sense of self that feels they have to angrily \u201cstand up to\u201d someone, instead of just calmly setting boundaries, and walking away when they aren\u2019t respected.", "Respect is earned. MIL hasn't. No apology needed. NTA.", "You are a supportive parent, not an AH.  Actions have consequences.  I am sure your daughter is hurt and angry though.  Please comfort her.  kt", "NTA.  Next time MIL invites you and family for a event or gathering, make up a really pathetic excuse and decline the invitation. Let's see how she like it.  \n\nI am petty like that. \n\nGood for your daughter to have a good solid BS detector.  She will need it a lot in future.", "NTA. You handled this perfectly and are teaching your daughter to not let those she cares about be disrespectful just because \u201cthey\u2019re family\u201d \nThis is a great lesson and sounds like you\u2019re a terrific mother. Way to go!", "NTA. \"Disrespectful teen\" is just boomer talk for \"teen who knows what she's worth and refuses to take shit from anyone\". Also, good parenting on your side, it is a good set of values to impart on her.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf for whatever reason you want to keep this toxic flake in your life, just assume she isn't coming to whatever you invite her to. Then if she shows, lovely. But don't buy tickets, reserve seats, etc.", "NTA. MIL made her bed, and now she has to lie in it. She chose not to be part of her grandkids' lives. These are the consequences.", "the husband has grown up with this behaviour so, in his reality, it is normal that MIL cancels because she probably has been doing so all his life for his important events.  \n\n\nWhat he needs to do is to question this normality, ideally deal with the hurt of having been delegated to a second plane by his own mother and not pass this kind of treatment down to his own children.   \n\n\nOP's rug sweeping has also helped the husband not to question the arrangements before.", "My grandparents were like MIL, I can't count the number of times they said they were going to visit, with me being excited all day, only to find out late evening that they weren't actually coming. I *can* count on one hand the number of events they went to for me. I stopped expecting anything from them when they skipped my grandparents' day because \"they already went for [brother], that should have been enough.\"", "That's an awful lesson, \"hey I know you stood up for yourself but I need you to walk back on that and like\"", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Super witty response! \n\nI can't blame her for saying this. MIL has simply never kept a promise to her and always cancels. At some point people are done with you if you keep doing that. No matter their age. \n\nNTA.", "It\u2019s a good lesson to teach a child that they can \u201cstand up for \u201c themselves without angrily venting their spleen at everyone who has slighted them. Calmly noting to herself that she has a shitty grandmother and resolving not to waste anymore time trying to include MIL in her life would have been far more empowering than losing her composure. When you let someone make you angry, you\u2019re giving them power over your emotions.", "I remember when I had agoraphobia the reasons I would make up for not going to things were stupid but I simply didn't want people to know the real reason. We are getting one side of the story and the MIL may have another for why she misses these events.", "My grandma does this too.

The kicker is that all his fucking girlfriend talks about is the shit they've done with her family.", "\u201cThat\u2019s just how she is!\u201d   OK.  This is just how I am.  Deal.", "Damn, I didn\u2019t realize my grandmother had a Reddit account!", "I am aware which is why I don't nor was I applying it to this case. Notice I didn't vote. I wouldn't diagnose somebody with a medical condition etc. based off any internet post, second hand account or otherwise. I was just giving an example of how repeatedly making excuses can sometimes be indicative of social anxiety.", "I'm like this with my now-teens. My mother could NEVER admit she was wrong, and if I ever spoke in opposition to her, heads would roll.  My kids call me on my shit if needed, because I'm not perfect and I'm not above admitting when I did something wrong.", "Agreed. Every time I hear that argument, my default response is \"Well no, you didn't turn out fine. You turned out as an adult who thinks it's *okay* to do that to children. I wouldn't call that fine\"."]}
