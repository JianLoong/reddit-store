DD is a member of a select choir that only has 3 concerts per year. MIL is retired, but often makes excuses for missing important events: birthdays,  holidays, etc. I used to validate these excuses when the kids were younger to soften the blow, but now that they're teens, I stopped trying to cover for her flakiness & apparent indifference toward them. My thought is they won't be as hurt if they know the situation & don't expect much from her. \n\nSo, end of year concert is upon us & MIL already told DD she would come, but now, she's backing out with some excuse about needing to take care of the yard. I told MIL to tell DD herself. I overheard DD's sarcastic response & it was something along the lines of, \"Oh, don't be sorry! Getting sticks out of your yard is far more important than my stupid concert! You stay right there & don't give me another thought. I won't bother asking you to come to my concerts at all in the future.\"  Then DD hung up & turned off her phone. I'm actually relieved that DD is less hurt than just pissed off & done. \n\nNow, DH & MIL want DD to apologize for being disrespectful, but I won't hear of it. I believe respect goes both ways. DD has a right to stand up for herself & if this \"last straw\" incident further damages the already fragile relationship between MIL & DD, so be it. An apology would be an admission of wrongdoing & I don't believe she is in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1683754582, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13e42p1/aita_for_taking_my_disrespectful_teens_side/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And if your husband is siding with her, he may need a reality check on how his mother is hurting his kids.\n\nKudos to you for standing by your daughter when she stood up for herself and her emotional boundaries.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you raised your daughter to stand up for herself that way. She didn\u2019t say anything insulting or directly mean. She just told her not to worry about her events anymore because she wouldn\u2019t be invited.", "NTA. If your MIL thinks what was said was disrespectful (and assuming it is anywhere close to what you posted above), she needs to sit down and think about it a bit more. Your daughter pointed a mirror at the situation and gave her grandmother exactly what she received. Ask your MIL how she'll feel if your daughter said her yard was a mess when she's laying on her death bed many years from now. Cause that's exactly where she's headed if something doesn't change.  \n\n\nETA: If husband does force daughter to apologize, I'd do everything I can to ensure she apologizing for any tone that was used, and make it clear that she feels the content of her message was accurate.", "NTA\n\nBut they are correct. An apology is owed. MIL owes one to DD any any other LO she has overlooked. She has bailed on her so many times, and you have covered for her that she thought she was golden. Good for your daughter.", "NTA\n\nMy father used to make excuses too and he only had visitation for one day every two weeks. My mom did her best to handle it so I didn't get hurt but eventually I saw what was happening and it hurt that he made everything else a priority except me. When I was 12 he called me on Father's Day to berate me on why I didn't call him, and I told him \"Why should I call you? You've never acted like a father towards me, you pick me up every other Saturday and leave me alone for 6 hours to entertain myself before dropping me off at home again. You might be my father, but you're not my dad.\"\n\n\nThat was the last time I spoke to him. 20 years later and he still doesn't get it. Sends me messages when he's feeling lonely, trying to get pity from me. Absolute bullshit.", "NTA. MIL is the one who should apologize especially for not being able to come up with a better excuse than yard care", "I think I love your daughter hahahaha \"You go girl\"\n\nand no, she is not wrong so she doesnt need to apologise", "NTA MIL wants to be disrespectful but doesn\u2019t want to be disrespected? MIL need to grow up and understand you get what you give.", "NTA, grammy is reaping what she sowed. She has proven time and again that she won't show up for DD. DD is calling her out, as well she should be!", "NTA, I think forcing an apology would just validate that MIL\u2019s feelings matter more. It just shows people pleasing is how you sweep it under the rug. I don\u2019t think she sounded aggressive and I think she has every right to be upset. Out of curiosity, is the MIL anxious? My mom is flakey like that, and while there is no excuse, knowing she has anxiety helps me understand better.", "NTA. Those two can get stuffed.  Your daughter is tired of the BS excuses.  Your MIL can't take her own sh*t being slinged back at her?  She'd better buy a rain poncho or learn to enjoy the smell.  Besides, it might be good for her lawn.  That will be important for the years ahead when she's all alone and has only her yard to keep her company.", "NTA.  Why should your daughter be respectful to someone who has repeatedly disrespected her, and proven that she doesn't matter?", "NTA. Your daughter didn't do anything wrong. MIL needs to recognise that she's not immune from being called out on her poor behaviour.", "NTA I'd be proud of her too. You don't get to constantly disappoint then demand an apology. MIL can get the fuck over herself. Stand your ground and let her stand hers. If that woman wants to die on this hill then so be it.", "NTA. Your husband should be telling his mother that it's downright shitty of her to just keep bailing on your daughter. Your MIL should be apologizing to your daughter, not the other way around. Sarcasm is appropriate in a situation where bending over backward to be polite to a person behaving in an impolite way actually does more harm than being honest about her disgust that Grandma has chosen lawn care over seeing her granddaughter sing.", "NTA. So many people are furious when you show them a mirror.", "NTA. Your daughter is a legend and you\u2019ve brought her up well\u2026with a backbone. Good job mum!", "NTA, and congrats on raising a young woman with a strong spine and a clear eye for bs. Don't just not make her apologize. Take her out to her favorite restaurant and celebrate her strength and intelligence. She's a rock star.\n\nBut your husband is an AH, bug time. He's happy to throw his daughter under the bus for his horrible mother. I don't know what the relationship between husband and daughter is, but she now knows that she can't trust him. \n\nPut a picture of your daughter and MIL in front of him and ask him to choose. He's already made his choice. Rub his face in it!\n\nYou and DD go NC with MIL. She's shown you that you and DD mean nothing to her. Block her and let go of any resentment. Do not give this idiot any space in your life.", "NTA. There is an apology owed here but it is to the daughter not by her.", "NTA. \n\nYour MIL has chosen the relationship she wants with your granddaughter. She's just shocked that her granddaughter is willing to treat her that way in return. \n\nYour MIL is an ass, you raised a smart kid.", "DH is dear husband? Let's say yes.

How dare she demand respect when all she has shown your children is that they aren't worth her time. You husband should be ashamed of himself for choosing his flaky mother over his daughter", "NTA. She rocks.", "I agree with you, but let's also look at this somewhat realistically. Daughter is 15, and said that, without tone? I doubt it. I suspect it absolutely was both insulting and mean, but it was also true.", "No, she's not anxious & I honestly doubt she canceled to do yard work. Judging by cancelations in the past, she most likely got a \"better offer\" & couldn't come up with a better excuse than the yard that didn't make her sound worse.", "OP said her daughter was sarcastic and I don't doubt there was tone. But at some point, elder or not, a grandparent's hurtful behavior deserves tone or they're not going to pay any attention to the behavior's impact (In my opinion).", "> she most likely got a \"better offer\"\n\nNot for nothing, but I really tend to 'lose' people like this rather quickly from my life. It's selfish and immature and frankly, nobody really has time for that nonsense.", "Oh, I agree the tone was deserved, but I felt like the person I responded to didn't take it into account. The first time I mouthed off to my grandmother she clutched her pearls too, it wasn't until she calmed later we were able to have a semi-adult conversation about it. All she initially heard was the tone, not the content."]}
