I told MIL to tell DD herself. I overheard DD's sarcastic response & it was something along the lines of, \"Oh, don't be sorry! Getting sticks out of your yard is far more important than my stupid concert! You stay right there & don't give me another thought. I won't bother asking you to come to my concerts at all in the future.\"  Then DD hung up & turned off her phone.

But she didn't call your MIL names, she didn't curse her out, she was snarky, yes, and she told her grandmother that she sees who she is and she's just not playing the game with her anymore. My guess is that your husband has dealt with this behavior from his mom all of his life and he just refuses to acknowledge the meaning behind it.

Explain dd\u2019s feelings are valid, you support her telling MIL she is hurt and will not ask her to apologize for her feelings or for communicating them.  Ask mil to apologize for her hurtful behavior.  Encourage dd to send grandma a letter explaining how hurt she is and asking mil to apologize.  MIL likely won\u2019t apologize, but I\u2019ve had people like this in my life and it feels really great to ASK.  Totally changed my thinking.  Finding the courage to ask for the apology the first time ( didn\u2019t get the apology, but I asked!) proved to me I could stand up for myself and I deserved the damn apology.  Made it easier to recognize the behavior and stop it quickly next time.  Now if a date is a hurtful AH, I demand the apology, I get the apology every time, then I dump the jerk.

He needs to back down on this and Protect His Children. That's what Father's are Supposed To Do!

MIL died years ago now BTW)  It made it all more sad because my VERY Loving, Caring Mom, died before my daughter was born. \ud83d\udc94 If she had still been alive, I'd probably have to tell my Mom to give DD some space. LOL Thank goodness she at least had her Papa, my dear Dad, until she was 6.5.\nMy Ex didn't really defend MIL, but maybe because his Mom (MIL) treated him the same way. It hurts to give examples about my DD, so here's one about her Dad, my Ex when we were still together. \nExample: On his Birthday one year, he (we) was surprised, when his mother didn't even bother to call him to wish him Happy Bday. Her oldest child, only son, only one of two children (not hard to remember your own 2 kid's Bdays) \nHe finally, late in the evening, called her. He said, \"Hi Mom\" MIL did say Happy Birthday. He said thank you, and said, \"I figured you might call me to wish Happy Bday\" Her response, \"You should call me, not the other way around, because I'm the Mom\" WTH! \ud83e\udd2c\nHe tried saying, \" But Mom, it's Not Your Birthday, it's My Birthday. Nope she dug in her heels even though she was wrong, just like your MIL and husband are doing.", "Then maybe grandma shouldn't promise granddaughter she'll be there - again?", "Nah, Grammy is the massive AH here for not only promising to go to the concert and backing out at the last minute but also having a history of doing so. She's a liar at this point and ***DOESN'T*** care that she's constantly lying to her granddaughter.", "If you wanted to raise a young girl to be a spineless doormat, making her apologize like this would be a good step in that direction.", "You sound like the scorned MIL lmao", "You happen to be the MIL by chance? That\u2019s the only logical reason I can think of for you to believe that the daughter is being the AH.", "No, sarcasm is good, the grandma deserved it. She is the disrespectful one and she should apologize.", "Probably because MIL has done the same to DH his whole life and if he were to think about it too deeply, he'd hurt to know he wasn't important enough for his mother to show up, either. It's easier this way, rather than realizing his mother just didn't love him enough to show up.", "I guarantee you DH has asked OP to put up with toxic MIL to \"make her happy\" or \"avoid conflict\" and now expects DD to do the same.", "This", "The stereotype \"men can't say no to their mothers\" isn't patently false. There's some truth to it.", "Unfortunately my dear, the amount of people that became parents because they could ( have sex) and not because they actively thought of it are many. And lately, I am starting to believe the vast majority.", "Yes. Grandma should not renig.", "Also, if his daughter stands up to his mother, she may do something as heinous as stand up to \\*him.\\*", "\"That's just how she is!\" \ud83e\udd37", "I\u2019ve been NC with my mom for almost two years, and recently bumped into her favorite cousin at a public event. Cousin was asking me my side of things. After I explained some of the reasons for my decision to cut my mom off she said, \u201cMy mom was like that. That\u2019s just how moms are.\u201d\n\nI simply replied, \u201cNot around here, they\u2019re not.\u201d", "I can't tell you how many times I've heard this line. I feel like I'm looking at my future with this post. Definitely NTA.", "Everyone used to say that about my husband's grandmother when she ran her mouth. No one stood up to her except me and my husband.", "Oh God, I hear that constantly about my FIL. Hubby and said \u2018not with us he won\u2019t be\u2019. Went LC for about 3 yrs, and wouldn\u2019t you know it but he\u2019s come around. Apparently someone who is an ass can actually recognize that their ass-ness drives people away and can change ass-ness ways."]}
