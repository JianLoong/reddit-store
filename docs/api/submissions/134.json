You can walk around in a bikini, it is ridiculous to be fussing over underwear.\n\nBut acting like people have to try to look in your window is a bit silly.  People are just... seeing.  I walk down the street, I look at the buildings around me.  If I look out my window, I see directly to the neighbor's window across the way. Just like they see directly into mine.
