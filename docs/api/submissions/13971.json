Regardless of differing opinions on education, your friend was picking a fight and being disrespectful of the path you've chosen, which is unwarranted unless you've also been disrespectful of his.", "NTA\nI'm sorry for his kid. He's setting him up to fail, but is also teaching him that this is due to the \"system\". Now, don't get me wrong, I'm the first in favour of burning down our existing systems and c replacing them with actual modern education systems, but they are also not that bad for a majority of kids. But I know kids like your friend's son: they constantly get into trouble, but their parents assure them that it's always somebody else's fault, so they are powerless to change anything. They tend to be a pita for everybody around, but they are also deeply unhappy.", "NTA. This is really sad for your friends children. Really hope the teachers can get through to them before it\u2019s too late.", "NTA. Drinking might have loosened his tongue? Yet I got the feeling this would have come to head out now between the two of you anyway. It's an incompatibility. It seems like you don't respect him or his approach to education and he doesn't respect your commitment to it. \n\nSometimes we have friends that we outgrow. I could say he's being a jerk, but that's really just about my values. The two of you value different things. Fundamentally. Hash it out and agree firmly to respect the others choices and disagree?

Don't criticise other people's patenting if you're unwilling to listen to their criticism of your parenting.", "(For context for those outside the UK, GCSEs - General Certificate of Secondary Education - are the UK's school exams for 14-16 year olds, and include maths, english, science, etc. The average person in the UK has 7 GCSEs, high academic achievers aiming for top universities can go for anywhere from 9-12. Barely scraping through three is exceptional and I'm somewhat surprised he wasn't held back a year without attaining the usual minimum of five. Academic achievement certainly isn't everything, but it sounds like this guy could have really done with some help)", "NTA", "NTA also it sounds like he's setting up his kid to get kicked outta school if he's always sending him to school with the wrong uniform/hair/lunch/etc.", "NTA. Also, sounds like you and your friend are no longer compatible. It's okay, we outgrow people. Make peace with it, disconnect yourself from the situation and get out there. Make some friends you're actually compatible with. I feel sorry for his kid who he is totally sabotaging because he has hangups about what an educational failure he is --but-- it's not your problem.", "NTA Drop your friend. Eventually he's going to get to your kids if you don't. He's a really bad influence for them. To tell you that you wasted your time in school was out of line. Unfortunately you can't do anything to help his child but you can help yours by getting away from him.", "This person has been coming at your livelihood for what seems to be a long time. Then, you happen to come at theirs and now we have a problem? Nope. They are childish, insecure, and yes, they are sabotaging their son.

Because they are benefitting directly from the resources/ knowledge and products that education has afforded society. Doctors/ engineers/ scientists/ programmers ..the list is endless. All people who went to school and got an education so that this family can live in a society and benefit from it\u2019s provided resources. He sounds like a dropout.
