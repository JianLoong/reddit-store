Regardless of differing opinions on education, your friend was picking a fight and being disrespectful of the path you've chosen, which is unwarranted unless you've also been disrespectful of his.", "NTA\nI'm sorry for his kid. He's setting him up to fail, but is also teaching him that this is due to the \"system\". Now, don't get me wrong, I'm the first in favour of burning down our existing systems and c replacing them with actual modern education systems, but they are also not that bad for a majority of kids. But I know kids like your friend's son: they constantly get into trouble, but their parents assure them that it's always somebody else's fault, so they are powerless to change anything.

Barely scraping through three is exceptional and I'm somewhat surprised he wasn't held back a year without attaining the usual minimum of five.
