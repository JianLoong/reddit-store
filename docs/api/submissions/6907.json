I\u2019m Hispanic and adopted also by the whitest people ever. So we, I guess, co-worker bonded over it at first. She talks about her heritage though as if she was raised Korean and pretends she doesn\u2019t have white parents? Which I don\u2019t understand but to each their own.\n\nSo, this coworker is constantly bringing Korean food into the office that smells so intense or bad the entire office smells for the rest of the day. I have a sensitive stomach with smells and cannot handle it constantly. We also work in an extremely small office space, so this isn\u2019t space where I can ask to move desks or I\u2019m bothered by some faint smell in the distance.\n\nNow I wouldn\u2019t have an issue if it was once in a while even once a week but it\u2019s making me physically ill at my desk every day for months now. I really can not emphasize enough that it\u2019s not the smell of intense seasonings or ingredients that is turning my stomach but it actually smells like expired bad food.\n\nYesterday was the worst, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I politely apologized and asked her if she could maybe consider eating in the break room because my stomach couldn\u2019t handle the smells. I would ask the same if our buddy Sam was bringing tuna sandwiches in.\n\nI think I said I\u2019m so sorry 10+ times in the process of asking because I know she is sensitive about it.\n\nShe got quiet and threw out her food.\n\nAgain I apologized 100 times but now the food was in the trash can next to my desk and it was deadly the whole day.\n\nI actually had to ask if I could go home an hour early and she made an off remark that I didn\u2019t have to pretend to be sick she wouldn\u2019t bring her \u201cculture\u201d to work again.\n\nI assumed things would be tense but I woke up this morning to a bunch of posts on her social media dragging me by name as a racist. She went as far as calling me a white supremacist in one and said that I told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to eat anything non-American in the office as it offended me.\n\nThat\u2019s NOT what happened, at all. My boss even said we have to have a meeting this afternoon regarding issues with coworkers, which this is obviously it, and now I\u2019m terrified I\u2019m going to be fired for being a racist.\n\nI tried to apologize to her and tell her there may have been a misunderstanding but she cried about how insulting her \u201ccultural food\u201d was the deepest racist attack she has ever experienced and she doesn\u2019t feel safe working with me anymore.\n\nMy other coworker (previously mentioned Sam) said that my comparison to him bringing Tuna wasn\u2019t the same because it has nothing to do with his heritage. He said that maybe my nausea is really some repressed racism. I don\u2019t even know how to process all this.\n\nI genuinely feel like I\u2019m losing my mind.

If they start acting weird, it's time to leave Cronyville.", "Lol @ \"Kimchi you had buried in the backyard for the past 2 years\"", "Well I think the ethnicity was mentioned because the co-worker is now calling her racist and specifically a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d although the OP is NOT WHITE.\n\nAs for the smells affecting OP more - if they are right next to co-worker, it\u2019s pretty likely that they are getting the brunt of the small, so not dramatic to say so.  They also just might be more sensitive to smells.  I am extremely sensitive to smells in a migraine inducing way, not nausea usually, but during pregnancy\u2026 whoooooo boy, yeah any strong smell and I\u2019d be puking.", "Not bringing smelly food to work is called consideration. I don't care if someone likes seafood for an example, I don't want to smell it for 8 hours.", "He's just asking her to eat it in the break room rather than at her desk where it will bother everyone all day, surely that's not an unreasonable request. Some workplaces even have a \"no eating outside the lunch room\" policies.", "> unless we know what food she brought in\n\nIt's Kimchi with 99.9% certainty. \n\nWhile it tastes great, it's smell is beyond bad, especially if you're not used to it.", "OP, ignore this person and their inane comment.\n\n\"WoUlD yOu saY tHe SaME,\" what an absolute dingus.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I mentioned Tuna since it was the first \u201csmelly\u201d non cultural related dish I could think of. Her food doesn\u2019t smell fishy by any means it smells more like expired milk and most are creamy dishes so I think she\u2019s genuinely using expired ingredients??? I don\u2019t know if that makes sense but it\u2019s genuinely not like strong smelling food but actually bad bad.", "Me, if you don't share", "But nines popcorn is the worst and the smell lasts forever.", "One of my coworkers before they left for their last day, went into the break room, put in popcorn for like 30 minutes. No one was in the break room it was separated from all the other offices. Omg was that break room full of smoke, set off fire alarms.", "Why would it be kimchi... Is this the only Korean food you know", "Would you also refer to sauerkraut and pickles as rotten, expired food? Language matters and that's where the problem comes in here.", "Only side dishes are fermented. Nobody is eating side dishes as a main meal either.", "Where did it say in her post that everyone was bothered and not just her? The one coworker she brought up didn't agree with her by her own writing so how do we know everyone else is bothered?????", "It wouldn't be just kimchi...that makes very little sense.", "It sounds like that was his own internal thought and how he described it to us.  \n\nIn his wording to the coworker, what he wrote was \"I politely apologized and asked her if she could maybe consider eating in the break room because my stomach couldn\u2019t handle the smells.\" which is an entirely polite request.", "I have.  Ive made an entire lunch out of kimchi and some hot white rice.\n\nEven if its not the main meal, its presence as a side dish is still smelly can still be detected and best left at home in an office setting.", "That's...strange then. Usually as a side meal you'd have make 3-4 pieces.", "You realize that you're not the only Korean person or only person who eats Korean food, yes? There are myriad ways to eat a meal and it's laughable that you're trying to equate a traditional setup with an office lunch.\n\nPlease, touch grass.", "The fact is nobody eats just kimchi as a meal. It just isn't a thing, or rather, a normal thing.\n\nAnd my other main point is that what was brought in most likely wasn't fermented.", "I just said Ive eaten kimchi as a meal.  What are these rules you're quoting?  Ill eat as I please.  If Im in a rush getting lunch ready, Im going to grab the most convenient items.  Wait until you hear that I use a fork and not chopsticks to eat my kimchi...\n\nYes its a side dish or even a condiment when you look at *traditional*  Korean cuisine and dining but whats stopping you or me from doing as I wish?", "Dude what.", "It's atypical. The person in the comment is Korean. Nobody is stopping anyone, but it's not normal is my point and therefore unlikely.", "What don't you understand?"]}
