It was indeed, as suspected, Fettuchini Alfredo. That\u2019s right, ya\u2019ll are mad at me for finding Korean food smelling bad and it wasn\u2019t even Korean. This unhinged woman\u2019s lies know no limits.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nSo to start she came in the morning and went straight to managers office. Told him all these racist things I said about her food and such and was crying in hysterics. Like absolute hysterics. My manager came out after, asked for the meeting, then went back over the past few hours and watched every interaction we had together over the last day and a half.\n\nWe have security cameras in the office due to working with some sensitive information, what we say and to who on the phone can legally matter a lot so we all *should* know we\u2019re being watched but maybe coworker thought that was a lie???? Forgot???? Who knows.\n\nLow and behold though, I didn\u2019t say or do anything racist, and was only asking her to follow rules insanely politely.\n\nMore over when he watched me leave the office yesterday, he watched me say goodbye to everyone and apparently RIGHT after I left Sam started asking the coworker about the food saying she told him she was making Fettuccini Alfredo and that it didn\u2019t look Korean AND THE IDIOT CONFIRMED! Apparently she thought I was ASSUMING it was Korean because of how she looks and that I was being racist. She assumed, because she looks Korean, that me asking her to eat in the break-room was an insult to Korean food and decided to just lie around that assumption.\n\nThe most unhinged shit I have ever heard in my entire life.\n\nI don\u2019t know who to be more mad at, my 3 coworkers who didn\u2019t tell me the shit was cheesy noodles, the culprit for lying this god damn badly, or Sam for knowing and gas lighting me so badly I thought I was going crazy.\n\nMy boss, THANK GOD, was extremely chill about it with me and we ended up shooting the shit for a short bit about some nerd stuff and he told me she\u2019s being put on 2 week leave while he and the owner figure out how to fire her without her trying to sue and to try and relax a bit. He also already had screenshots of her socials and the company will be threatening legal action if she doesn\u2019t take it down. However he did advise me, as many of you guys did, to consider a lawyer or restraining order because this entire thing is so unhinged.\n\nSo basically - I\u2019m not fucking crazy, as much as I\u2019ve felt like it all god damn day.\n\nFucking Fettuccini Alfredo.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014- ORIGINAL POST\n\n\nSo I have a Korean co-worker who was adopted when she was a baby by the whitest people I have ever met. I\u2019m Hispanic and adopted also by the whitest people ever. So we, I guess, co-worker bonded over it at first. She talks about her heritage though as if she was raised Korean and pretends she doesn\u2019t have white parents? Which I don\u2019t understand but to each their own.\n\nSo, this coworker is constantly bringing Korean food into the office that smells so intense or bad the entire office smells for the rest of the day. I have a sensitive stomach with smells and cannot handle it constantly. We also work in an extremely small office space, so this isn\u2019t space where I can ask to move desks or I\u2019m bothered by some faint smell in the distance.\n\nNow I wouldn\u2019t have an issue if it was once in a while even once a week but it\u2019s making me physically ill at my desk every day for months now. I really can not emphasize enough that it\u2019s not the smell of intense seasonings or ingredients that is turning my stomach but it actually smells like expired bad food.\n\nYesterday was the worst, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I politely apologized and asked her if she could maybe consider eating in the break room because my stomach couldn\u2019t handle the smells. I would ask the same if our buddy Sam was bringing tuna sandwiches in.\n\nI think I said I\u2019m so sorry 10+ times in the process of asking because I know she is sensitive about it.\n\nShe got quiet and threw out her food.\n\nAgain I apologized 100 times but now the food was in the trash can next to my desk and it was deadly the whole day.\n\nI actually had to ask if I could go home an hour early and she made an off remark that I didn\u2019t have to pretend to be sick she wouldn\u2019t bring her \u201cculture\u201d to work again.\n\nI assumed things would be tense but I woke up this morning to a bunch of posts on her social media dragging me by name as a racist. She went as far as calling me a white supremacist in one and said that I told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to eat anything non-American in the office as it offended me.\n\nThat\u2019s NOT what happened, at all. My boss even said we have to have a meeting this afternoon regarding issues with coworkers, which this is obviously it, and now I\u2019m terrified I\u2019m going to be fired for being a racist.\n\nI tried to apologize to her and tell her there may have been a misunderstanding but she cried about how insulting her \u201ccultural food\u201d was the deepest racist attack she has ever experienced and she doesn\u2019t feel safe working with me anymore.\n\nMy other coworker (previously mentioned Sam) said that my comparison to him bringing Tuna wasn\u2019t the same because it has nothing to do with his heritage. He said that maybe my nausea is really some repressed racism. I don\u2019t even know how to process all this.\n\nI genuinely feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. I didn\u2019t mean to offend anyone, let alone this badly.\n\nReddit\u2026.

(Which I came in 2 hours early this morning to make up work for before we were even open)", "I genuinely when I made the post felt like I was losing my god damn mind because of how upset this girl is. More comments the more sane I feel and I\u2019m not having a damn panic attack anymore over my job. Have you really never met someone who is so serious about their shit you question your own sanity?\n\nI genuinely still don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to lose my job over this because it\u2019s a small office, my manager doesn\u2019t like drama, and at this point his girl is making it out to seem like I\u2019m a racist and it has nothing to do with food.\n\nSo ya, no I genuinely thought I might have been the ass hole here waking up to 15 posts about how I\u2019m suppressing being a racist and I deserve to lose my job \ud83d\udc4d", "Genuinely not me, on fucking god. I just spent my entire fucking lunch break responding to comments genuinely. I really am not that dude and it\u2019s beyond upsetting.", "I never said they can\u2019t bring it at all, she\u2019s the only person who eats at her desk. I had limited text but my other 3 coworkers who walk on eggshells around her thanked me after work. The only person who didn\u2019t agree with me also called me racist because they are her best friend outside of work not just at work.\n\nI genuinely have no issue with her bringing food but when everyone else eats in the break room or out of the office why should we all have to struggle with the smell at our desks?\n\nMore over its not that her food is cultural or intense, I genuinely think she is using expired ingredients. It doesn\u2019t smell a lot - it smells BAD - like * SPOILED *\n\nAnd FYI there is a sign in the breakroom that says to keep all meals in the \u201ckitchen\u201d", "I would say the same to any food that smelled genuinely rotten. As I said in the main post it\u2019s not that the smell is intense it is actually genuinely bad like spoiled milk. My best friends growing up we\u2019re Vietnamese and though their food smells can be intense and different it was never like this. \n\nI don\u2019t care what culture the food is from, I have nothing again Korean food, I actually love Korean BBQ and have a mom and pop I frequent which again smells really intense but not BAD.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough that it has nothing to do with cultural food but that however she is cooking these dishes - something is genuinely not right.", "Okay so\n\n1. The comment on her being raised by white people was made originally before I ran out of character limit because I went over some of the comments she is making about me on social media which included her saying I insulted her Korean parents for teaching her how to cook this way. When I removed the comments I forgot ti backspace that part but that was where the context was for that. It had nothing to do with the food or saying she can\u2019t cook Korean food because she was raised by white people. It had everything to do with the fact she\u2019s saying I insulted her Korean parents and family - which is not it.\n\n2. I literally cook with MSG. My favorite restaurant is a Korean BBQ place and I have no issues with the scent. Her food doesn\u2019t smell intense it smells genuinely bad. And yes ALL her home cooked meals smell genuinely bad - not intense - bad. I don\u2019t think the girl can cook and there have been plenty of times she has brought dishes that looked clearly American that smelled just as god awful. Her chicken noodle soup smelled like a literal wet shoe. I didn\u2019t say I had an issue with her food being Korean or smelling like such - her food smell genuinely bad no matter what she cooks. SHE was the one who made it about being Korean food and race not me. I just asked her politely to eat in the break room.", "Okay so I need to copy paste my response at this point.\n\nI ran out of characters and had to backspace but forgot that part. I had included that because I had originally posted the things she was saying on social media like that I insulted her entire Korean family who taught her how to cook. Which - not the case. I also genuinely have seen her being home cooked meals of all kinds not just Korean in and it\u2019s always insanely bad. I just don\u2019t think the girl can cook and it has nothing to do with her race.\n\nAgain - I wasn\u2019t even the person who brought up race originally. I didn\u2019t even know the food she brought in yesterday was Korean until I woke up to being called a racist on social media. It looked like fettuccini Alfredo made with Rice noodles. I really cannot emphasize enough that race was only brought up here because of the fact I\u2019m being called a racist for asking her to eat in the breakroom.", "So I had originally made a longer post but had to backspace a bunch of stuff due to character limits. I mentioned her background because I had originally included quotes of what she was saying on social media. Some of her comments were how I insulted her Korean parents and family for teaching her to cook like that and really messed up shit. I never even had an issue with the fact it was Korean and honestly didn\u2019t even know all her food was Korean till I woke up to being called a racist all over social media. Her dish yesterday that set me over the edge looked like fettuccini Alfredo made with rice noodles so I really had no fucking clue.\n\nAs far as I was concerned yesterday I was asking a coworker politely to follow the written office rule to eat in the breakroom because her lunch smelled rotten. I had no idea it was Korean till she brought it up and really didn\u2019t care what it was.\n\nBut as far as the comments on her family, as far as food goes it doesn\u2019t matter at all but the original context was because of what she\u2019s saying on social media.", "I\u2019ve gotten a lot of comments on that but you can check my comment history I spent my whole lunch break and then some trying to respond as genuinely as I can to as many comments as I can. I don\u2019t know what the other person is about but I can assure you no one has the time and energy to sit here responding to this much over bullshit", "1. I genuinely don\u2019t know about the other person but you can check my comment history I\u2019m taking so much time to try and respond as genuinely as I can to everything. I really don\u2019t have a problem with Korean food, didn\u2019t even know her food was Korean until she said something about it and being racist.\n\n2. The original post was too long and I had to backspace but I wasn\u2019t trying to be snarky about her heritage but quoted her social media posts which included statements about me insulting her Korean parents for teaching her to cook this way. The context was there to emphasize how insane the lying is on socials not to degrade her culture by ANY means. I just got all discombobulated when trying to fit character limit.", "Yes, 3 other coworkers thanked me after work yesterday for saying something even. I was by far not the only one.\n\nI also really have to emphasize she has cooked things that are not Korean and still smell like death. It doesn\u2019t smell intense, I love Korean BBQ places and never had an issue. Her food smells genuinely spoiled no matter what she makes. I didn\u2019t even know it was Korean until she started calling me a racist.\n\nNotable nightmare foods:\n\nChicken noodle soup that wreaked of wet shoes.\n\nYesterdays meal looked like fettuccini Alfredo made with rice noodles but genuinely smelled like spoiled milk.\n\nShe made biscuits that when heated up made the whole office smell musty. I didn\u2019t even know it was possible.\n\nShe had a chicken dish once that smelled like rotten trash.\n\nAgain - not intense or overwhelming smelling but actually foul. I just think the girl doesn\u2019t know how to cook and I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s stomaching eating any of it. Out of the office there are 6 of us and our manager who isn\u2019t in the main office space - like a closed door down the hall. There\u2019s Sam, her, myself, and 3 others. Sam is her best friend outside of work and self proclaimed \u201chas no sense of smell\u201d which is why I made the comment that \u201cI\u2019d say the same of Sam brought Tuna\u201d so myself and the 3 other coworkers that can smell can confirm it is really really bad no matter what she brings home cooked.\n\nFor the record also - she does get take out from my favorite Korean BBQ place I\u2019ve mentioned in a few comments. Any time she gets takeout her food is fine. It\u2019s only her home cooked meals that smell absolutely foul and again it\u2019s no matter what she cooks.", "Absolutely.

You don\u2019t have to like dishes or smells from every cultures food, and you should be able to say that without it being considered offensive. Unless of course they disparage the culture, which is not okay. \n\nAnd if you know that you have a particularly smelly dish you should be courteous when brining it to the office or to small spaces, like when traveling.

Apparently she thought I was ASSUMING it was Korean because of how she looks and that I was being racist.

This is something a lot of Asian-Americans are taught when growing up. Heck even the Americanized Asian food can get weird comments if it's not from a chain! Asian food uses a lot of different spices and fragrances that some may never have experienced, and that's ok.

It has nothing to do with ethnicity and everything to do with common courtesy. I think ANYONE who brings in strong smelling food into an office environment is rude. One of the rules in working in a shared space is that you have to be super careful and considerate of those around you. Bringing in extremely pungent foods is a no-no. When you're in a break room or cafeteria, there is some room for leeway, but in an office space, absolutely not. The mix of smells from everyone's food would absolutely make me feel sick too. People are allowed to work without feeling like they  have to fight nausea all day.\n\nAsking someone to eat in the break room (cuz that's what it's for) is NOT an unreasonable request and your co-worker is being completely irrational. But I would be very, very careful in the wording you choose to use going forward, OP. Your co-worker sounds a bit like they are not being reasonable about this but you can't outright say that without sounding racially insensitive so best to avoid it all together.

The aroma's of Latin and Asian cuisines in particular make me salivate. I tried my first batch of kimchi as a kid and the smell does nothing for how it tastes. It smells like something is rotting to me (I feel the same about bread in the beginning stages - ooooh boy that yeasty smell is STRONG!) but OMG it's so delicious! I used to live on an Army base as a kid and one of our Korean neighbors made Kimchi once a week and the entire neighborhood knew when she was making it because you could smell it. It became a running joke, even with her daughter. But the good thing was that we all also knew that there was gonna be a FEAST at her house that weekend! That smell signified that good food was comin... (One could also argue though that someone using their grill to BBQ meat can also stink up a neighborhood too. The point is, strongly flavored food has a smell but that doesn't mean people are being racist by commenting on it.)", "So, YTA for how you handled the food situation. The fact is, a lot of offices have people bringing in foods with strong smells. People may not even realize this because they are used to it. Korean is not an unusual food type to bring in the office. You're kinda policing what people are bringing when you need to find a way to remove yourself from the smells. You should have been going to your boss first to see if a compromise existed for a better location for lunches away from the work area.\n\nAs someone who frequently brings in leftovers, I would find you a nightmare to work with. Most of my office would, tbh. Your idea of strong smells is likely not the same as others. Furthermore, if you can't even handle tuna sandwiches, you are, in fact, imposing unreasonable restrictions on your coworkers. Cold tuna sandwiches are not extremely smelly. I have an office that includes avid fishermen. I have gotten the fish in the micro treatment a lot from other coworkers. Cold tuna sandwiches are absolutely a much milder smell and an easy, cheap food for many.\n\nThe issue is you can't handle strong smells, not the food your coworker brings.

So no assumptions made.\n\nAlso there is a rule to eat in the office.\n\nAnd I also only made that comment because the original post was too long and I had to shorten it, the other half of that paragraph was quoting what she had stated on social media which included saying I called her Korean immigrant parents (her words not mine) racial slurs. Which I added the adoption detail as it was explaining the full level of her lies.", "Dude, on god it shouldn\u2019t smell like that. I fucking love Fettuchini Alfredo. This woman should not be allowed within a 100ft radius of a kitchen. I don\u2019t know how you can mess up something that bad but when I say it smelled rancid it was BAD bad.", "It's literally fettuccine alfredo. Read the updates.", "the other woman literally brought in rotting fettuccine alfredo. how is op racist. like, please explain because i'm genuinely confused.", "Did they edit something? Because the third paragraph explicitly states that the food smells bad because it's expired, not because of the seasonings used.", "omfg I can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t realize the smell is so bad??? And she eats Alfredo EVERY DAY???", "OP was called a white supremacist. Not white was intended to call out insanity. The very poor wording was 1000% based on lack of sleep. The two statements should have been separated and clearly worded better.\n\nThanks for calling me TA though. Literally the first time on this sub! I admit I earned it for saying something stupid.", "That wasn't clear from the original post. But I have now seen that and her update that the other employee was see as the delusional person she is.", "it was fettuccini alfredo", "I read it and he is still the ah. That once instance was fettuccini. Every other time it has been Korean food. And his comments about her Koreanness and how white she really is because she was adopted by white people make him a huge ah. One time of it not being Korean food does not absolve him of every other shitty comment and his take on it.", "It's not my job to educate people on how they're racist, that's their job.", "No like her cooking was ALL that bad no matter what she brought. One day she made chicken noodle soup and it was so notably pungent like a wet cloth shoe that was worn all day. She even offered people to taste it and one of our other coworkers was so desperately curious as to why it smelled like that and risked it for the biscuit.\n\nThey ended up vomiting later that day and said it was the worst thing they ever tasted. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with her taste buds or sense of smell but holy god I didn\u2019t even know anyone could be so oblivious.", "OP only called the other instances Korean food after the coworker claimed it was Korean food. \n\nIt ended up not being Korean food, rather it was just straight up poorly-made food.\n\nKorean food shouldn't smell as bad as OP described unless the coworker is bringing in the strongest kimchi every day, which really doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nLink to comment where it wasn't exclusively Korean food and that it's literally made other people throw up: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107gz6u/aita_coworkers_cultural_food_smells_up_office_she/j3okikv?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "lmfao.", "Yes. Cooked broccoli smells like cooked garbage when reheated. When you know it is broccoli (and not actual garbage) it is bearable but when that smell just sneaks up on you, bleah. Almost worse than reheated fish.", "Same as well. Nobody would listen in the office though.\n\nI believe that its specific to microwave popcorn and the chemicals that are put in it.  It's not like professionally made popcorn from a store, it's got some kind of fake butter chemical in it or something.\n\nIt used to make me very nauseated almost to the point of passing out.", "Omfg that\u2019s crazy!!! Her olfactory bulb has to be FUCKED LOL", "Maybe she had a nasty covid case that ruined her nose?", "I never said I was. I don't understand these comments. Everyone is allowed to present their opinions except for me? The lady above who I responded to said she finds Korean food smells disgusting - she is everyone? I really really don't get it", "When you say that in response to someone saying everyone is different, it looks like you're trying to DISAGREE, by stating \"yeah but I'm x\".\n\nSorry for mis-reading, but MAYBE you should think about WHY everyone had that reaction, read it like that?", "You shouldn't be so righteous or rude either. I think you're projecting. How could a simple one statement comment be taken as pedantic?!!!!", "Nah I'm good.", "Careful you don't hurt yourself falling off that high horse, pal.", "Can I just say my favourite part is when she called you a white supremacist and your culture is Hispanic.  Right there proves girl was Bat shit crazy.  Get a lawyer. Sue her ass.", "NTA - Office space is for office work, breakroom is for food.   I find a number of foods that disturb my concentration.  As I wrote this is sounds a little extreme but onions on pizza or large sandwiches seems to attach to my nostrils and I find it distracting.\n\nI would go to HR and explain and complain that a coworker is disturbing the office atmosphere.  As for being racist I would think extreme smells that you are not used to are more aggravating that foreign smells.\n\nWe had a guy who would cook broccoli and cheese for lunch.....wow that would bring tears to a glass eye.  It turns out we had to suck it up because he had some sort of special dietary requirement.", "Wait. Fettuccine Alfredo stinks?? Is she making it with feta?", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised the Alfredo smelled bad, but in general I think it\u2019s common courtesy not to each smelly ass food when confined in a small space. \n\nI use to have a co worker who sat right next to me and always heated of cauliflower and broccoli in the microwave and come back to her desk to eat. I hated it.", "I would go and see a dr though as wanting to through up over a pasta dish is not normal. NTA", "Totally agree. Except I think because it\u2019s written it would be libel rather than slander?", "NTA, but why is her upbringing relevant here?", "The worst smelling thing I have ever encountered in the workplace is microwaved cauliflower. I like cauliflower but even I nearly vomited from the smell in a cramped office.", "Wait I\u2019m not trying to put your side down or anything but just curious about some clarification, you said \u201cas suspected\u201d it was fettuccine.

I do have sensory issues due to autism and ADHD, but I do not not have a lot of food smell triggers. The only time Korean food has ever triggered me was when there was a particular kind of pickled radish. Radishes have a compound in them that some people are super sensitive to, and I am one of those people. I can tolerate being around some kinds of mild radishes, and most pickled daikon from Japanese restaurants is fine, but there is some kind of pickled radish that some Korean restaurants use that I cannot be around without getting sick. I don't know if it's something about the pickling process that's different or the exact kind of radish. But it heightens the smell of that compound to be out of this world and it *really* lingers. So I wonder if others who are sensitive to radishes also run into this problem? Otherwise I am not sure what else people are reacting to, unless they're just general fermentation haters. \n\nI know my dad hates the smell of all sprouts? They make him nauseous, which sucks because the rest of my family loves sprouts and microgreens, all kinds. But there must be other people out there like my dad. And I know Korean food can use a lot of sprouts.\n\nI guess the other thing could be the amount of garlic, since apparently some people barely ever use garlic in their cooking, and I know that garlic smells bad if you haven't eaten any in a long time, but my family always used a ton of garlic so I don't even notice that aspect. Maybe it's all of those smells combined that does it for some people.", "Fun (or not so fun) fact: Butyric acid is a chemical that contributes to the smell of both parmesan cheese and vomit. Alfredo always puts me off, but I never could pinpoint why until I learned that fact. It literally smells like vomit (amongst other things) to me.", "They'd mentioned in an earlier comment that it visually looked like fettuccine afredo just made with rice noodles", "Wow gotcha. Jesus that is a crazy thing to lie about. Sounds like that coworker is going through a meltdown.", "I eat Korean mainly for the ripe strong smell and taste. \n\nbimbimbap is one of my favs", "I'm so amused at the update in which apparently this was the coworker's fettucine alfredo and now I'm also vaguely grossed out by how weird one has to make fettucine alfredo smell so strongly and like expired, bad food.", "probably doesn't think of noodles as Korean", "They said it smelled like the food had gone bad, so maybe the coworker was eating food that was in fact going rancid?", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107gz6u/aita_coworkers_cultural_food_smells_up_office_she/j3npqn4/", "thank u!!"]}
