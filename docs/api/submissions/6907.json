I\u2019m Hispanic and adopted also by the whitest people ever. So we, I guess, co-worker bonded over it at first. She talks about her heritage though as if she was raised Korean and pretends she doesn\u2019t have white parents? Which I don\u2019t understand but to each their own.\n\nSo, this coworker is constantly bringing Korean food into the office that smells so intense or bad the entire office smells for the rest of the day. I have a sensitive stomach with smells and cannot handle it constantly.

I would ask the same if our buddy Sam was bringing tuna sandwiches in.\n\nI think I said I\u2019m so sorry 10+ times in the process of asking because I know she is sensitive about it.\n\nShe got quiet and threw out her food.\n\nAgain I apologized 100 times but now the food was in the trash can next to my desk and it was deadly the whole day.\n\nI actually had to ask if I could go home an hour early and she made an off remark that I didn\u2019t have to pretend to be sick she wouldn\u2019t bring her \u201cculture\u201d to work again.\n\nI assumed things would be tense but I woke up this morning to a bunch of posts on her social media dragging me by name as a racist. She went as far as calling me a white supremacist in one and said that I told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to eat anything non-American in the office as it offended me.\n\nThat\u2019s NOT what happened, at all. My boss even said we have to have a meeting this afternoon regarding issues with coworkers, which this is obviously it, and now I\u2019m terrified I\u2019m going to be fired for being a racist.\n\nI tried to apologize to her and tell her there may have been a misunderstanding but she cried about how insulting her \u201ccultural food\u201d was the deepest racist attack she has ever experienced and she doesn\u2019t feel safe working with me anymore.\n\nMy other coworker (previously mentioned Sam) said that my comparison to him bringing Tuna wasn\u2019t the same because it has nothing to do with his heritage. He said that maybe my nausea is really some repressed racism. I don\u2019t even know how to process all this.\n\nI genuinely feel like I\u2019m losing my mind.

My best friends growing up we\u2019re Vietnamese and though their food smells can be intense and different it was never like this. \n\nI don\u2019t care what culture the food is from, I have nothing again Korean food, I actually love Korean BBQ and have a mom and pop I frequent which again smells really intense but not BAD.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough that it has nothing to do with cultural food but that however she is cooking these dishes - something is genuinely not right.", "Okay so\n\n1. The comment on her being raised by white people was made originally before I ran out of character limit because I went over some of the comments she is making about me on social media which included her saying I insulted her Korean parents for teaching her how to cook this way. When I removed the comments I forgot ti backspace that part but that was where the context was for that. It had nothing to do with the food or saying she can\u2019t cook Korean food because she was raised by white people. It had everything to do with the fact she\u2019s saying I insulted her Korean parents and family - which is not it.\n\n2. I literally cook with MSG. My favorite restaurant is a Korean BBQ place and I have no issues with the scent. Her food doesn\u2019t smell intense it smells genuinely bad. And yes ALL her home cooked meals smell genuinely bad - not intense - bad. I don\u2019t think the girl can cook and there have been plenty of times she has brought dishes that looked clearly American that smelled just as god awful. Her chicken noodle soup smelled like a literal wet shoe. I didn\u2019t say I had an issue with her food being Korean or smelling like such - her food smell genuinely bad no matter what she cooks. SHE was the one who made it about being Korean food and race not me. I just asked her politely to eat in the break room.", "Okay so I need to copy paste my response at this point.\n\nI ran out of characters and had to backspace but forgot that part. I had included that because I had originally posted the things she was saying on social media like that I insulted her entire Korean family who taught her how to cook. Which - not the case. I also genuinely have seen her being home cooked meals of all kinds not just Korean in and it\u2019s always insanely bad. I just don\u2019t think the girl can cook and it has nothing to do with her race.\n\nAgain - I wasn\u2019t even the person who brought up race originally. I didn\u2019t even know the food she brought in yesterday was Korean until I woke up to being called a racist on social media. It looked like fettuccini Alfredo made with Rice noodles. I really cannot emphasize enough that race was only brought up here because of the fact I\u2019m being called a racist for asking her to eat in the breakroom.", "So I had originally made a longer post but had to backspace a bunch of stuff due to character limits. I mentioned her background because I had originally included quotes of what she was saying on social media. Some of her comments were how I insulted her Korean parents and family for teaching her to cook like that and really messed up shit. I never even had an issue with the fact it was Korean and honestly didn\u2019t even know all her food was Korean till I woke up to being called a racist all over social media. Her dish yesterday that set me over the edge looked like fettuccini Alfredo made with rice noodles so I really had no fucking clue.\n\nAs far as I was concerned yesterday I was asking a coworker politely to follow the written office rule to eat in the breakroom because her lunch smelled rotten. I had no idea it was Korean till she brought it up and really didn\u2019t care what it was.\n\nBut as far as the comments on her family, as far as food goes it doesn\u2019t matter at all but the original context was because of what she\u2019s saying on social media.", "I\u2019ve gotten a lot of comments on that but you can check my comment history I spent my whole lunch break and then some trying to respond as genuinely as I can to as many comments as I can. I don\u2019t know what the other person is about but I can assure you no one has the time and energy to sit here responding to this much over bullshit", "1. I genuinely don\u2019t know about the other person but you can check my comment history I\u2019m taking so much time to try and respond as genuinely as I can to everything. I really don\u2019t have a problem with Korean food, didn\u2019t even know her food was Korean until she said something about it and being racist.\n\n2. The original post was too long and I had to backspace but I wasn\u2019t trying to be snarky about her heritage but quoted her social media posts which included statements about me insulting her Korean parents for teaching her to cook this way. The context was there to emphasize how insane the lying is on socials not to degrade her culture by ANY means. I just got all discombobulated when trying to fit character limit.", "Yes, 3 other coworkers thanked me after work yesterday for saying something even. I was by far not the only one.\n\nI also really have to emphasize she has cooked things that are not Korean and still smell like death. It doesn\u2019t smell intense, I love Korean BBQ places and never had an issue. Her food smells genuinely spoiled no matter what she makes. I didn\u2019t even know it was Korean until she started calling me a racist.\n\nNotable nightmare foods:\n\nChicken noodle soup that wreaked of wet shoes.\n\nYesterdays meal looked like fettuccini Alfredo made with rice noodles but genuinely smelled like spoiled milk.\n\nShe made biscuits that when heated up made the whole office smell musty. I didn\u2019t even know it was possible.\n\nShe had a chicken dish once that smelled like rotten trash.\n\nAgain - not intense or overwhelming smelling but actually foul. I just think the girl doesn\u2019t know how to cook and I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s stomaching eating any of it. Out of the office there are 6 of us and our manager who isn\u2019t in the main office space - like a closed door down the hall. There\u2019s Sam, her, myself, and 3 others. Sam is her best friend outside of work and self proclaimed \u201chas no sense of smell\u201d which is why I made the comment that \u201cI\u2019d say the same of Sam brought Tuna\u201d so myself and the 3 other coworkers that can smell can confirm it is really really bad no matter what she brings home cooked.\n\nFor the record also - she does get take out from my favorite Korean BBQ place I\u2019ve mentioned in a few comments. Any time she gets takeout her food is fine. It\u2019s only her home cooked meals that smell absolutely foul and again it\u2019s no matter what she cooks.", "Absolutely. I can't believe everyone is siding with OP with their degrading comments.", "NTA\n\nAlso, if you haven't already, get screenshots of her posts on social media, especially if they actually mention your name or are easily shown to be aimed at you. That's literally libel and may violate some office policy.", "While you are not overall the asshole, this is not the commentary i would lead with in defending yourself.   The documentation on the difficulties and often (even unintentional) racism international  adoptees experience in the US is compelling, and, well, there's a lot of it.    \n\n\nYou don't know what this girl has gone through, but it's safe to bet that she does not view her adoptive family as her real family, regardless of whether or not they are 'nice'.", "It's not relevant what her relationship to her birth/adoptive parents is!", "Was looking for this!", "Do you have an HR? \n\nTry to get things in email or text for documentation. write down to the best of your ability what things they've said to you as well. Protect yourself.   Best of luck", "More like someone is making up different stories in order to gather results and do \u2018social experiments\u2019.", "a lot of the fermented vegetables do have a strong smell though. kim chi for example.", "Yeah, I'm super curious about what the food is lol. Maybe fish-heavy dishes? Idk I know some people are sensitive to reheated fish smell. Still, it's surprising to me that it would be consistently that intense.", "Probably the kimchi, if you\u2019re not used to the smell it can be very strong/overwhelming.", "I don\u2019t think people recoil because it\u2019s unfamiliar, they recoil because they don\u2019t like the smell. Being Korean you probably grew up eating and smelling certain foods, which may be an acquired taste/smell. But someone that doesn\u2019t eat those dishes all the time may not like the smell of it. \n\nYou don\u2019t need a sensory issue to not like the smell of certain foods. Everyone has different noses and taste buds, and that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to like dishes or smells from every cultures food, and you should be able to say that without it being considered offensive. Unless of course they disparage the culture, which is not okay. \n\nAnd if you know that you have a particularly smelly dish you should be courteous when brining it to the office or to small spaces, like when traveling. I love Indian food, which smells amazing to me, but I would never bring it to work and heat it up and eat it at my desk if it\u2019s a dish that smells very strong. Because there may be people that don\u2019t care for the smell in a small space.", "Pasty white granny here, and I think Korean food is delightful and does not smell bad at all. Well, with the exception of \ubc88\ub370\uae30", "I love Korean food, including Kimchi, but some of the homemade fermented kimchi out there smells like hot garbage diapers.  I remember walking into a lunchroom that smelled strongly of farts and didn\u2019t realize that it was someone\u2019s microwaved food until later.  \ud83d\ude02\n\nIf someone isn\u2019t used to a smell, it smells strong, period- just think of people who wear too much perfume because they have become noseblind to the scent they wear every day.", "I love Korean food, including Kimchi, but some of the homemade fermented kimchi out there smells like hot garbage diapers.

Popcorn microwaved correctly smells great, burnt popcorn stinks to high heaven and the smell lingers for hours! My grad school's office banned popcorn in the communal microwave since people kept burning it, and making everyone else miserable.", "Try to get your coworkers to write sworn statements saying what you said. The coworkers will not have to be named. You really have to protect yourself because you could get fired for her lies.", "Consider emphasizing that in the meeting.  She should not be eating at her desk.", "Doesn't really matter if the manger doesn't like doing it, just tell them to do their job, politely - of course.", "I think she might be new to cooking Korean food, and OP is probably correct about it smelling bad/expired, because a lot of Korean food is fermented, which isn\u2019t bad Korean food is quite delicious.\nbut if she doesn\u2019t know how to ferment it properly it might actually be expired/filled with bad bacteria that is smelly rather than the good probiotic bacteria. \nIt might be how she\u2019s storing the food too, if not packaged correctly or fermented correctly, the food might be bad, and might be full of smelly bad bacteria rather than the probiotic bacteria she was trying to foster.", "But is it actually smelly or does OP think anything that isn't a piece of white bread too strong to be in his majestic presence?", "It doesn't smell bad at all.  Get the fuck out. What about Mexican food? Or literally any food with chilies in it? You're full of shit and an asshole.", "It's also retaliation which corporate PR can be legally liable for if OP medically cannot tolerate something that is common in Korean food that he hasn't been previously exposed to (allergen induced nausea can happen when inhaled). OP needs to have an allergy panel done to see if it's an allergy or psychosomatic.", "I\u2019m sorry I need a damn copy paste since I\u2019ve been going crazy trying to clarify. \n\nI only mentioned that because my original post (which exceeded character limits and I had to backspace a bunch) quoted stuff she was saying on social media which included emphasizing how I not only insulted her but her entire Korean family and parents for teaching her to cook that way.\n\nShe told me about how she doesn\u2019t even know her birth parents and never spoke to them and they gave her up when she was not even 1. So how can I possibly be insulting her Korean parents for teaching her how to cook?\n\nThere was context there originally that had nothing to do with the food.", "It does when she is dragging me on social media for insulting her Korean family for teaching her how to cook when she never even met them. If I\u2019m being called a racist that says slurs about her and her parents on social media - I think the fact she\u2019s lying flat out in every way is relevant.", "OP said they don't have an HR in their comment directly above yours. Just one manager and six workers.", "Only very ripe kimchi has a strong smell, fresh kimchi is no more pungent than dill pickles are.", "Not really? You can't smell it until you get close to it or unless you microwave it (even that id doubt).", "OP said in a comment that they're creamy dishes, and it's not fish because they don't mind fishy smells. I have no idea what this could be, since creamy dishes aren't really a part of Korean cuisine.", "As I mentioned elsewhere, kimchi is only strong smelling if it's very fermented/ripe. Fresh kimchi doesn't smell any more than pickles or sauerkraut or even greek yogurt does.", "Also possible she's trying some home fermentation recipes and not getting the bacterial cultures right.", "that happened at my work as well, they had to evac the building and firefighters showed up because they thought there was a fire", "Even completely edible fermented food can carry undertones of odors where people not familiar with these foods smell them and associate that with spoilage.\n\nI brought home some cheese from france once and my family thought I had the nastiest foot odor.  It was the cheese in my carry on which was entirely edible, quite pungent and very strong.  It wasnt spoiled, its considered a delicacy.  f I did bring that to work, Id keep that in the lunch room, not at my cubicle.", "OP says they've smelled kimchi before and had no problem with it. I wonder if she's trying out some home fermentation recipes and hasn't got the bacterial cultures right yet, or doesn't know how to spot problems. It could genuinely be a spoiled fermentation.", "That one coworker only said a tuna sandwich wasn't a good comparison because it lacked the heritage component and, I suspect, was mighty glad he didn't take sides when the shit hit the fan.", "No smelly food should be eaten in the office area. That's a common courtesy. I don't care what the origin of the food is, if it smells, it should not be eaten in the office. \n\nBTW, you're getting just a little too emotional about this issue. You must be one of those people that brings smelly food to the office as well.", "This is a really good point", "gotcha.       \n\n\nI'd still be very careful about my words choices when i explain this situation.  less is more, and absolutely no commentary on her heritage/adoption/birth parents or 'korean' food.

I do fully intend however to bring up what she\u2019s saying on social media and how none of these things ever happened and it needs to be taken down.", "You REALLY need to get screenshots of her social media posts where she names you. I would honestly let the manager know that you are looking at potentially getting a lawyer for blatant slander and that you physically reacting to smells is not \"racism\" but is actually a severe symptom of being exposed to strong odors, and that it is a protected class under the ADA.\n\nYou need to go HARD about this because she is willing to cause actual harm to your career. Something like this can cause long term affects and she NEEDS to get told to back down immediately."]}
