It baffles me that some men think it's perfectly ok to invade their SO's personal space/alone time just because \"we're a couple\" or something stupid like that. Sit him down and tell him these baths are for you alone, not both of you. You have no problem setting aside some couples time, but it won't be in the bathtub. Lock the door as soon as you get into the bathroom, before you turn on the water. If he complains or whines, tell him, \"See you in an hour.\" End the conversation there, and don't answer anyone until you're ready to come out of the bathroom.

You say the denial really hurts him, but the fact is that he has no care for your needs if he does this each time. And not for nothing, but if you let him get away with that regularly, he is likely thinking that bath time equates to sexy time. For him it's becoming a sort of Pavlovic response.", "NTA.  At all.

If you've never talked about your love languages, he might not really understand in a meaningful way that physical touch isn't *your* primary love language and in his mind he might be thinking to himself, \"Jeez, I'm trying to help!\" because that's what he would want and he doesn't understand how to give you what you need.", "NTA, for sure. You may need to express to your husband that between working with kids all day, and having your own kids at home, you are overstimulated and you need time **alone** to decompress.

He is TA for not respecting this", "NTA\nI think it's awful that you're made to feel bad/guilty for wanting some rest and some alone time.

You're never the asshole for saying no to sex you don't want, or setting aside time for yourself.", "NTA.\nHere's the thing about requests, any request where \"No\" isnt an acceptable answer, without consequences, it's a demand. People don't get to demand things from you, whatever your relationship to them is. That's controlling. \nAnd flipping out, getting mad, sulking, etc, after a \"No\" is emotional manipulation and is a tactic used by abusive people to make saying \"No\" too much trouble for the other person emotionally due to the abusive person's behaviour after a \"No\". Keeping you exhausted is another, but it falls under physical abuse, not emotional.", "NTA - how do people legitimately think that the most basic boundaries are an attack on others", "HUGE NTA. He needs to respect your alone time. \n\nI would suggest maybe making it a point to take joint baths once a week/biweekly to make him feel included.

When you say no, he feels like you are rejecting him.\n\nTalk to him and say that when you head to the bathroom on your own steam, he can be 100% sure that you are tired and need to rejuvenate. It is not 'have fun' time for you. He should NOT at all interpret your actions as any form of invitation to him. Then you add, that you now understand that he sees taking a bath together as something fun and intimate that he would like to do with you. Depending upon how you feel about that, you can say that the two of you can PLAN a bath time together once or twice a month. If a shared bath is just not your thing at all, that's probably a bit more of a conversation about mutual wants and needs and limits, but you can assure him that you want to find a solution that is good for both of you. Maybe there's a different way you to can be fun and intimate together that works better.\n\nGood luck for both of you.", "NAH but you should have a talk with him and explain how this is something you need to wind down.

Make it clear to everyone in the house that the only way that you are not a horrible judgmental cranky willing to throw things at their head person is by being left alone in your fortress of solitude twice a week. This seems like a sensible and very easy ask. Let your partner know fun sexy time is for another time it is not in my fortress of solitude time. Personally I know if my partner doesn't get a day or a day and a half of quiet alone introvert time that those sexy times are not going to happen. So it is to both of ours benefit that those quiet times happen.

As long as he can get his rocks off occasionally he's happy.\n\nNTA.

Probably not. \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t keep getting \u201cdenied\u201d if he just respected your boundaries.

I don't use my bathtub to get time to myself twice a week. I do it around 4x. And I take myself out by myself, go in long walks or bike rides, see friends, etc. Your partner isn't automatically entitled to your off time, even if you're married with kids. A person's time is their own, and if you expected something from them without communicating it, you're just hurting your own feelings with your expectations.

I can understand by myself she may need some time for herself to decompress at the end of a full day, and that the last thing she needs after that is having to deal with a grumpy offended partner that makes her feel guilty about having that little alone time. actually when my partner takes a bath I know it's because she's particularly tired and stressed and I try to help more than usual on that night.
