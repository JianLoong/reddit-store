Then why not you move out and let him stay at the house and he can pick up the kids 5 out of 5 of the school days?", "YTA yes. He is clearly trying to be accommodating and considering you initiated the divorce, that is a very mature thing to do. Pay for childcare if you can't look after your children on the days you have custody, that was your decision not his.", "YTA - if you need a revised court order get one.

I mean, your reasons may be noble but still, YTA.", "YTA. How would the conversation go if the roles were reversed? Would you like to have to travel a few towns over and deal with traffic? How much of that time is actually spent with the kids and not focused on driving? It is not good for anyone, specially the kids.", "YTA - He's a couple of towns over? So he's having to drive what, 30-45 minutes each way to pick up the kids on days that aren't his usual responsibility.\n\nAnd I'm gathering it's probably often a case if getting very little notice? If that's the case then you're even more of an AH because he can't make or keep plans.", "YTA - This seems like a one-way street/double standard.

Not the case for everyone", "INFO Why can't he take the kids back to your house and stay with them until you come home?", "YTA You're not the only one working to support yourself and two young kids. Luke has to work also. It's not being a \"baby\" when you're doing all you can. Perhaps you and Luke need to come together and hire a sitter to help with the slack.", "YTA. While I'm sure your ex is happy to get extra time with the kids it sounds like you're still punishing him.", "YTA. Get after school care for your children. Your soon to be ex is living in a different town and you absolutely cannot expect him to picked up the children from school for you. Apologize for calling him a baby!", "YTA. It is unreasonable of you to expect your soon to be ex husband to drive two towns over to provide after school care because you can't pick them up after work, multiple times a week. You need to find a different solution, an after school program or parents or a friend or something. Alternately you need to change the custody arrangements, although that may not be feasible if you're the one living in the school district and he's two towns away, unless they move to a school in his town or he moves back into the same school district, which I'm sure he would have had that been a workable option.\n\nThis is part of the reality of separation, when you split custody you are responsible for meeting the needs of the children while they're in your custody. You have to solve the problem of work hours versus school hours just as millions of other single parents do.\n\nYou can make it easier on yourself by being the best co-parent you can be. If you are pleasant and reasonable, and willing to compromise when required (although not too much), most of the time the other person will also be fairly pleasant and reasonable, and willing to compromise. Some exes are the worst people in the world to co-parent with, but children do best when their parents can at least be polite acquaintances.\n\nFor the sake of your children, please be reasonable and respect his time. That's a perfectly reasonable request of his. Take a couple of deep breaths and find a better solution for after school care, you have broken up, that vastly diminishes the responsibility he has to you. Stop calling him names and grow up. He's not being an absent father by sticking to the custody arrangement you agreed on. Furthermore, what are you doing making it harder for him to work extra if that's what he wants to do? If he's working extra so he can help you support the kids when they're in your custody, then he's being a good dad. Get over yourself. Yes breakups suck, but you've got two kids with him. You will have to co-parent and it looks like you've got a man who is willing to do his share. Stop punishing him or whatever you think this is, and start being a decent human to him for your children's sake.", "If your job demands have changed and his haven\u2019t, then you both need to coordinate a different schedule. If he takes them every weekend all weekend, that sounds like being a present father. \n\nBeing civil and working out a system which everyone is happy with is the goal. Perhaps he takes them 3 days of the school week and every other weekend. His concerns that he is taking on too much are valid. \n\nYou\u2019re both the asshole for the petty name calling. Grow up.", "YTA", "YTA, just curious with what authority did you kick him out of the house? Do you own the house?", "YTA, you had an agreement and you are not sticking up on your part and then you mock HIM for not being fine with your failures. \n\nYou failing in sticking up on the agreement will be used against you in court by his lawyer when it comes to custody. If you would have been grateful for his help and apologised and found a better solution there would have been a chance he doesn't bring this up in court, but  the way you went about it - the man would be stupid to not use this against you to proove that you are not a reliable parent. \n\nOh, and good luck not sticking up to your end of the deal when there will be a court order in place. But you can just try to mock the judge then, lol.", "INFO - what caused you to throw him out the house , and why did he have to move so far away", "Without knowing more I'm going with YTA.\n\nA \"few towns over\" how long is that drive for him? I think a fair comprise would be to have him pick up the kids and goto your house so he can actually relax and decompress after work. \n\nOr you know, they can ride the freaking bus? I've never understood parents who are adamant about picking up and dropping off their kids everyday. It's a waste of time, gas, & energy.\n\nAlso: it makes me smile to see the comments in agreement for once lol.", "YTA and perhaps the best way to handle this is to switch living conditions. Let him live in the house (since you constantly need his help) while you find other accommodations and take the kids for the weekends.\n\nOf course, nothing should be agreed to without a court order.", "YTA, you can\u2019t depend on him to make your life flow anymore. Stick to your agreement and call upon another adult if you need help on your days.", "YTA. You need to find a babysitter or after school care.

You're a single parent now and are responsible for your kids on the days they're in your care.\n\nGet after school care arranged for the kids instead, like every other single parent does.", "YTA why should he have to spend the money on fuel to get your boys from school when he lives miles away in another town while you are closer its you that took on the extra work so how should you call him a baby. you had access to the kids all set up but now you don't care because he is a baby as he moans about picking them up when its not his job but yours. you need to get your priorities straight before you call any one a baby", "YTA.  You can't kick him out and then expect him to be your free daycare provider.  Under the circumstance, it would make a lot more sense for the kids to stay with him during the week, even if they have to change schools.  \n\nYour other choices are to modify your work schedule so that YOU can watch the kids after school every night.  Or, hire professional daycare to watch them for a few hours a day.\n\nRight now, your ex is essentially spending all his free time (week days and weekends) watching the kids.  That's only fair if he has full custody.    \n\nWhat really bothers me is this part:  \" he\u2019s also been working extra to try and send me some money to help make ends meet\"\n\nIn other words, even before you have a formal parenting plan, he's paying you child support.  Only, because of your work schedule and your demand that he watch the kids week night AND weekends, he actually has physical custody 50% or more. \n\nIt's a huge AH move to expect him to do more than half of the work of raising your kids.  And then accepting money from him to help you do the work that you have foisted off on him.  \n\nIf I was your EX, I'd probably sue for 100% physical custody.  Ironically, it would be a lot less stressful for him than the status quo.  And any family court judge would see your current situation as...you have very little time to spend with the kids anyway.  So YOU should be the one paying child support and seeing them \"every other weekend plus 6 weeks on Summer break\"", "YTA.\n\nIt's not reasonable to just tell him to pick the kids up based on what you happen to be doing.    I expect you would not appreciate if he did the same to you.\n\nAgree on your days, stick to that.  If you have an emergency, work with your ex, don't dump it on him", "ESH. Daycare or after school program will take care of the issue.", "Ok, so the split is only a few months old, you're new to coparenting. For that reason I won't be too harsh, but ESH.\n\nYou're both learning how to be single again, and how to be solo parents. The way you've written your post sounds like you expect him to drop everything when you need it. This isn't the way it works, barring an emergency. In some respects it sounds like he's helping you out with picking up the kids, but he's then complaining about it. That's not cool on his part, it'll just build resentment towards you and the kids will pick up on it.\n\nIf you haven't already, work out a parenting plan together (with lawyers if absolutely necessary, although if you can work it out amicably together I'd highly advise it). Work your schedule around your parenting plan, and stick to it. If it's absolutely necessary to ask him to go outside the parenting plan, then offer to pick up the slack for him on another day.\n\nBreakups suck, and they're even harder when there's kids. But from here on in, the main job for each of you it to love your kids more than you hate each other.,\n\nEDIT: Also, stop the namecalling - it won't make him easier to work with and again: the kids will pick up on it.

I half suspect her head might literally explode when her lawyer breaks it all down for her in simple language.  The relevant fact, ,when it comes down to it is...who is caring for the children more?  It's going to be virtually impossible for OP to ask for physical custody then.  She has clearly demonstrated she doesn't have time to care for the kids and won't make time.  She expects the father to watch them at all times when she is not working.  If the judge is stupid enough to grant her custody, (not likely, but for argument sake) then she's still screwed.  Because the judge will expect her to take responsibility THAT SHE'S NOT DOING NOW.  Meaning, she can't foist the kids off on their father when it's convenient for her.  And if she tries that shit after the parenting order is signed by the judge?\n\nLike I said before.

Also keep in mind that when getting an apartment he would have to get something that accommodate the whole family or a judge may look at it negatively. So he may have needed a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment. That would be a significant expense, it would also be a rare find and so him living far away would be a direct consequence of her kicking him out. \n\nPlus the multiple snide remarks, there's good reason to not give OP the benefit of the doubt that the husband has anywhere close to the same responsibility.", "As a divorce lawyer, I can assure you, people can be that unreasonable and lacking in self awareness.", "I'm not saying OP wouldn't deserve it, the comment I responded to had mentioned other parents doing this and I was only chiming in with why, as a parent, I personally would find that way more taxing to do than work out something agreeable is all.", "Lock your bedroom door genius", "Even if you were, \u201c100% custody\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he never gets to see the kids.

It's entirely possible she's being manipulative, fully agree that is a possibility. I also don't know why he lives cities over, is that choice or necessity? She claims hes not very present.
