Then why not you move out and let him stay at the house and he can pick up the kids 5 out of 5 of the school days?", "YTA yes. He is clearly trying to be accommodating and considering you initiated the divorce, that is a very mature thing to do. Pay for childcare if you can't look after your children on the days you have custody, that was your decision not his.", "YTA - if you need a revised court order get one.

I mean, your reasons may be noble but still, YTA.", "YTA. How would the conversation go if the roles were reversed? Would you like to have to travel a few towns over and deal with traffic? How much of that time is actually spent with the kids and not focused on driving? It is not good for anyone, specially the kids.", "YTA - He's a couple of towns over? So he's having to drive what, 30-45 minutes each way to pick up the kids on days that aren't his usual responsibility.\n\nAnd I'm gathering it's probably often a case if getting very little notice? If that's the case then you're even more of an AH because he can't make or keep plans.", "YTA - This seems like a one-way street/double standard.

Not the case for everyone", "INFO Why can't he take the kids back to your house and stay with them until you come home?", "YTA You're not the only one working to support yourself and two young kids. Luke has to work also. It's not being a \"baby\" when you're doing all you can. Perhaps you and Luke need to come together and hire a sitter to help with the slack.", "YTA. While I'm sure your ex is happy to get extra time with the kids it sounds like you're still punishing him.", "YTA. Get after school care for your children. Your soon to be ex is living in a different town and you absolutely cannot expect him to picked up the children from school for you. Apologize for calling him a baby!", "YTA. It is unreasonable of you to expect your soon to be ex husband to drive two towns over to provide after school care because you can't pick them up after work, multiple times a week. You need to find a different solution, an after school program or parents or a friend or something. Alternately you need to change the custody arrangements, although that may not be feasible if you're the one living in the school district and he's two towns away, unless they move to a school in his town or he moves back into the same school district, which I'm sure he would have had that been a workable option.\n\nThis is part of the reality of separation, when you split custody you are responsible for meeting the needs of the children while they're in your custody. You have to solve the problem of work hours versus school hours just as millions of other single parents do.\n\nYou can make it easier on yourself by being the best co-parent you can be. If you are pleasant and reasonable, and willing to compromise when required (although not too much), most of the time the other person will also be fairly pleasant and reasonable, and willing to compromise. Some exes are the worst people in the world to co-parent with, but children do best when their parents can at least be polite acquaintances.\n\nFor the sake of your children, please be reasonable and respect his time. That's a perfectly reasonable request of his. Take a couple of deep breaths and find a better solution for after school care, you have broken up, that vastly diminishes the responsibility he has to you. Stop calling him names and grow up. He's not being an absent father by sticking to the custody arrangement you agreed on. Furthermore, what are you doing making it harder for him to work extra if that's what he wants to do? If he's working extra so he can help you support the kids when they're in your custody, then he's being a good dad. Get over yourself. Yes breakups suck, but you've got two kids with him. You will have to co-parent and it looks like you've got a man who is willing to do his share. Stop punishing him or whatever you think this is, and start being a decent human to him for your children's sake.", "If your job demands have changed and his haven\u2019t, then you both need to coordinate a different schedule. If he takes them every weekend all weekend, that sounds like being a present father. \n\nBeing civil and working out a system which everyone is happy with is the goal. Perhaps he takes them 3 days of the school week and every other weekend. His concerns that he is taking on too much are valid. \n\nYou\u2019re both the asshole for the petty name calling. Grow up.", "YTA", "YTA, just curious with what authority did you kick him out of the house? Do you own the house?", "YTA, you had an agreement and you are not sticking up on your part and then you mock HIM for not being fine with your failures. \n\nYou failing in sticking up on the agreement will be used against you in court by his lawyer when it comes to custody. If you would have been grateful for his help and apologised and found a better solution there would have been a chance he doesn't bring this up in court, but  the way you went about it - the man would be stupid to not use this against you to proove that you are not a reliable parent. \n\nOh, and good luck not sticking up to your end of the deal when there will be a court order in place. But you can just try to mock the judge then, lol.", "INFO - what caused you to throw him out the house , and why did he have to move so far away", "Without knowing more I'm going with YTA.\n\nA \"few towns over\" how long is that drive for him? I think a fair comprise would be to have him pick up the kids and goto your house so he can actually relax and decompress after work. \n\nOr you know, they can ride the freaking bus? I've never understood parents who are adamant about picking up and dropping off their kids everyday. It's a waste of time, gas, & energy.\n\nAlso: it makes me smile to see the comments in agreement for once lol.", "YTA and perhaps the best way to handle this is to switch living conditions. Let him live in the house (since you constantly need his help) while you find other accommodations and take the kids for the weekends.\n\nOf course, nothing should be agreed to without a court order.", "YTA, you can\u2019t depend on him to make your life flow anymore. Stick to your agreement and call upon another adult if you need help on your days.", "YTA. You need to find a babysitter or after school care.

You're a single parent now and are responsible for your kids on the days they're in your care.\n\nGet after school care arranged for the kids instead, like every other single parent does.", "YTA why should he have to spend the money on fuel to get your boys from school when he lives miles away in another town while you are closer its you that took on the extra work so how should you call him a baby. you had access to the kids all set up but now you don't care because he is a baby as he moans about picking them up when its not his job but yours. you need to get your priorities straight before you call any one a baby", "YTA.  You can't kick him out and then expect him to be your free daycare provider.  Under the circumstance, it would make a lot more sense for the kids to stay with him during the week, even if they have to change schools.  \n\nYour other choices are to modify your work schedule so that YOU can watch the kids after school every night.  Or, hire professional daycare to watch them for a few hours a day.\n\nRight now, your ex is essentially spending all his free time (week days and weekends) watching the kids.  That's only fair if he has full custody.    \n\nWhat really bothers me is this part:  \" he\u2019s also been working extra to try and send me some money to help make ends meet\"\n\nIn other words, even before you have a formal parenting plan, he's paying you child support.  Only, because of your work schedule and your demand that he watch the kids week night AND weekends, he actually has physical custody 50% or more. \n\nIt's a huge AH move to expect him to do more than half of the work of raising your kids.  And then accepting money from him to help you do the work that you have foisted off on him.  \n\nIf I was your EX, I'd probably sue for 100% physical custody.  Ironically, it would be a lot less stressful for him than the status quo.  And any family court judge would see your current situation as...you have very little time to spend with the kids anyway.  So YOU should be the one paying child support and seeing them \"every other weekend plus 6 weeks on Summer break\"", "YTA.\n\nIt's not reasonable to just tell him to pick the kids up based on what you happen to be doing.    I expect you would not appreciate if he did the same to you.\n\nAgree on your days, stick to that.  If you have an emergency, work with your ex, don't dump it on him", "ESH. Daycare or after school program will take care of the issue.", "Ok, so the split is only a few months old, you're new to coparenting. For that reason I won't be too harsh, but ESH.\n\nYou're both learning how to be single again, and how to be solo parents. The way you've written your post sounds like you expect him to drop everything when you need it. This isn't the way it works, barring an emergency. In some respects it sounds like he's helping you out with picking up the kids, but he's then complaining about it. That's not cool on his part, it'll just build resentment towards you and the kids will pick up on it.\n\nIf you haven't already, work out a parenting plan together (with lawyers if absolutely necessary, although if you can work it out amicably together I'd highly advise it). Work your schedule around your parenting plan, and stick to it. If it's absolutely necessary to ask him to go outside the parenting plan, then offer to pick up the slack for him on another day.\n\nBreakups suck, and they're even harder when there's kids. But from here on in, the main job for each of you it to love your kids more than you hate each other.,\n\nEDIT: Also, stop the namecalling - it won't make him easier to work with and again: the kids will pick up on it.

A lot of the Y T A posters are saying it's your job to take care of the kids on your day, but they are missing two things. One, if they have to be put in daycare/ after school care, that's an expense the courts would order the both of you to split. Two, if you have significantly more custody time than the other parent, most things are going to happen on \"your\" time. Both of you are 100% parents to the children and both should be responsible for the children when available.

If your work schedule makes you work weekends, then so be it, that's how it was with my ex and I for a couple years because he worked weekends, but if it's not because of a work schedule, don't give him every weekend, you need free time with the kids, too. \n\nMaybe it's time to arrange that he has the kids a couple nights during the week of that works better with your schedules. He can drop the kids off at school/ pick them up a couple days instead of having them on the weekends. If he's not able to bring them to school in the morning due to work hours, then a temporary solution would probably be to let him stay at your house with the kids. I know it's not a sustainable option, but if the work thing is temporary for you and this saves a lot of time for him and the kids with driving, then it's probably what's best for the kids. I understand feeling like you lack privacy, but honestly, now isn't the time to be out meeting new men and dating. Get your current messy relationship ended properly and then start dating. \n\nCalling your ex names isn't going to help the situation.

You should either find someone else to care for your kids until you get off work or move him back into the house because he might as well just live in your house if he has to be there 3 out of 5 school days. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You need to be aware you are not the only with employment obligations/logistics. \n\nYou either need to have after school child care or figure out alternative with your job. He can\u2019t be the father he needs to be if he\u2019s unemployed bc you have lifted a finger to figure it out", "YTA.", " You need to have this arbitrated formally.\n\nYou need to get a court order and abide by that. Let a court arbitrate. You should have a visitation agreement and a support agreement - so all parties know what is expected, what is fair and have a means to appeal if they want those terms changed.\n\nYou\u2019re adults you must handle this like adults. Get your paperwork in order.", "YTA, Sounds like you are too busy to care for your children during the week so maybe you should be the one to move out and let him have the kids during the week and you have them on the weekends.      Or the kids should have school districts, still live with him during the week and you get weekends.", "Extreme YTA. You\u2019re trying to have it both ways.", "YTA, it sounds like he's trying to be a good dad, but your taking advantage of him rather than being a mature adult in this situation. Talk about the option of childcare, and if he rather split childcare costs rather than pick them up. That would be the mature action, communicating and making a joint decision, not you telling him what to do.", "Leaning towards YTA\u2026isn\u2019t there an after-school program and bussing available (if after-care is off school property)? Perhaps you can trade-off with another parent in your neighborhood for pick-ups etc. If he HAD to move away for economic reasons it was really not his choice. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t enjoy living so far from his children and WOULD like to see them more often if he could. Your requests are unreasonable.", "YTA. Hopefully Luke is smart enough to document all of this to request primary physical custody and child support.", "I think the fact that YTA is already crystal clear, but I'm curious about what you will actually do now?", "When do you spend time with your kids? He has them every weekend and most weekdays after school. And he needs to be more present?? YTA", "ESH", "YTA\nYou should be planning around the support you've arranged for your kids. \"Unexpectedly having to work late\" more often than not suggests you don't consider being there for your kids after school to be a hard boundary. Why are you not leaving work on time knowing you have to get your kids? How can you start your work week without a firm idea and plan for balancing your work day and your parenting responsibility?\nIt seems as if you regard their father's time, energy, and priorities as secondary to your entitlement to require him to pick up your slack, failing to prioritize your children, at your beck and call. Threatening to create barriers to his seeing his children in retaliation for his normal attempts to establish a schedule and hus own necessary boundaries is cruel and manipulative.", "Start looking for someone you can pay to pick up the children after school. There may be a Y or other community organization that picks them up for an afterschool program.", "YTA", "So, you want Luke to be more present as a father. He has his kids every weekend. You want him to have them \u201ca few hours\u201d at least 3 out of 5 weeknights. It sounds like you aren\u2019t very present as a mother. Maybe Luke should have primary custody and you could see the kids whenever you could fit them into your busy schedule. YTA", "So why'd you kick him out?", "YTA", "YTA and you are in for a massive wake up call. He is taking care of the kids EVERY weekend, paying support, you are living in the house that he will be entitled to half of AND you expect him to drop everything during the week to cover for you.  Being an ass about it is just the cherry on top.\n\nIt really makes me wonder what your expectations are when the formal proceedings happen.  Like many have said you are in for a rude awakening because he is getting the short end of the stick in every instance here and that won't last.", "YTA\n\nYou kicked him out and set certain expectations for when he's going to see them, and he is rebuilding his life around those expectations. Now you're changing the rules and expecting him to leap at your beck and call when during the week is your responsibility. You can't have it both ways.", "Also, children need a consistent routine. If they're just willy nilly seeing their father on random days and then not seeing him on other random days, it can cause issues because they never know what to expect.", "My servant? Oh please", "I totally agree that they need to figure something out that works for them and the children, and it needs to be in the order.  100%. It's not ok to just expect someone to drop everything when they aren't supposed to have the kids all the time.\n\nHowever, I also don't like the idea that he should get all the weekends while she does the weekdays. I've been a working single mom.  Weekdays are HARD.  Transporting to and from school, sports practices, homework, trying to fit dinner in there. Weekends are freaking easy.  I understand he moved away but that doesn't really make it ok that she gets all the hard work and he gets to be the weekend parent.  They need to work something else out.", "I'm pretty sure OP is Judith from Two and a Half Men", "Right? They are his kids too. So if Luke isn't having sex with OP, he doesn't have to parent his kids? The kids are just her problem now and he's under no obligation? Not her fault he moved 2 towns over.", "Exactly and you know OP would flip if he wasn\u2019t working she\u2019d have a cow.", "Maybe he had to move that far away because it was the only apartment he could afford after being kicked out of his house?", "Your audacity and generally smug shitty tone says you\u2019re clearly the asshole. You have them during the week, YOU figure out pickups because that\u2019s YOUR job. Stop using the \u201che needs to be present\u201d as an excuse to have him at your beck and call. Also, YTA. A big one.", "I\u2019m sure your vibrant attitude will fix this whole thing for you! Just keep being your sweet self and he\u2019ll come around as you\u2019re clearly a treasure and he would be a fool to not throw away every ounce of his free time to accommodate you. You\u2019re a winner. Lol", "Commenter was clearly exaggerating to make a point, but you did call him a baby because he isn't happy with the arrangement you're forcing on him, so you are being obtuse in this situation. You have no moral high ground OP, sorry.", "Jeez. You sound lovely", "I apologise for their mistake; they meant slave.", "And the cost of gas for the extra driving. It adds up", "Each way. They have to drive back home from dads.", "Wait... so you set the schedule and he pays you support? that means YOU can't afford the after school care right now, not him. He is not responsible for afterschool care during your time. That was your choice. That is not a dad problem on top of the other reasons why.", "If you as a grown adult are referring to another adult as a baby, that should raise a flag to do some self reflection.", "I don't know where you live but the aftercare programs  everywhere that I've lived have been about 30 dollars a week and usually if you have 2 kids attending you get a discount on the second child. I'm curious how much the school charges that it's way out of reach for you financially.", "If you call someone you were married a baby for the way he talks, you're not any better. You sound insufferable and entitled, I try to understand how you feel \u2013 maybe he made something very bad. But your behavior and the way you express everything about this doesn't put you in good light", "Yep. I feel like this is the case too.", "She kicked him out, so he probably didn't have a lot of notice.   If they live in a high cost of living area, he might have taken the first place he could get so he would have some place to be with his kids.   I guarantee you she would have used the \"he doesn't have a stable home environment so shouldn't have shared custody of the kids\" as strike against him.   Maybe if she is too busy during the week to get the kids after school, she should have the \"easy\" weekends and he has the kids during the week.", "So then figure out your own childcare during your custodial times (like you should be doing anyway) or relinquish more custody to him. But it\u2019s unreasonable to expect him to drop everything on a dime to help you out when you likely wouldn\u2019t do the same.", "YTA. 100%. Full stop. Based on what you\u2019ve said here, it\u2019s pretty easy to see that you would be extremely hard to live with. My wife and I went through a rough spot a few years ago and patched things up, but if she had behaved like this during that period, I\u2019d have said good riddance. \n\nAs someone else who has been in a separated situation for a while - no, you should not be dating or bringing other men back to your house. This sounds like it\u2019s a pretty recent thing that\u2019s happened, but for both yours and the kids sake, you can wait a little while before dating and having other men over to the house. You\u2019re still married until those papers are signed, you can be an adult and restrain yourself until that\u2019s finished.", "Why did you even get married or had kids then ?", "My money is on her having unreasonable and uncommunicated expectations. When he was unable to keep doing X, Y, and Z because he couldn't read her mind, she decided it was time to find someone better. Either that or he has female coworkers and therefore must be cheating on her because he's not doing all the things he used to do for her before they had kids. \n\nDisclaimer: This is all pure speculation and just based off my gut, not any facts or special inside knowledge on the relationship. Just a guess.", "Where I live, it's $150 per week per child but they do offer certain subsidy programs if you can qualify. I have a friend in a neighboring city who said hers was more expensive than that. She unexpectedly needed after school care for her child after her husband passed.", "None of that changes the fact that they need to work something out.  This is obviously not working.  I'm not placing any blame on him moving away, and we also don't know WHY she kicked him out.  It could have been very necessary. And all of that is neither here nor there.  \n\nThey both have parenting responsibilities and they need to talk and work something out that will work for everyone long term.  Rehashing the relationship and why and how it ended doesn't solve anything.", "Not when they\u2019re around. And I\u2019m sorry but even if I was, that doesn\u2019t excuse him looking through my underwear drawer to see if they\u2019ve been touched.", ">This is the price you pay to\u2026not do this exact thing to your kids.\n\nIf done right, the kids should feel like they have two homes where they are welcome. That is a *much* better option compared to the adult not having a home that feels welcoming because it's shared with their ex. \n\nThat being said, it's rarely done right. The best example I've seen was when the parents lived a few blocks from each other so the kids could freely visit either home as they wished. But most exes have too contentious a relationship for childcare to be that casual. The second best example I've seen is when the parents bought duplicates of everything important so the kid doesn't have to lug a bunch of stuff back and forth to feel comfortable.", "$150 at the school? That's insane, now I see why you can't afford it. Maybe look for another parent at the school who could pick up the kids and watch them for a few hours. \n\nIt's possible a stay at home parent wouldn't mind doing it for a little extra cash. $30 for a few hours each day or something like that. Even if you paid them $100 a week it would be much less than $300. \n\nDefinitely apply for the subsidy program because what you're doing now isn't working. It's either that or cut back your hours at work or change the custody arrangement. I'm a single parent with zero help and sometimes you just have to figure shit out and get creative.", "Are you planning to ask for 50% custody? \n\nIf so, you still need to do better. Right now, you're demonstrating to a court (and your kids) that you cannot handle 50% custody. At best, you look like you should get weekends while he gets them all week. \n\nWhen it's your day with the kids, everything is your responsibility. You do not get to expect your ex to be at your beck and call for mere convenience. Certainly call him in an emergency but not just because it's easier for you. \n\nIf you can't rearrange your work hours, you need to accept that you cannot have primary custody of the kids. This may mean accepting that for 2 days out of the week they should be picked up and cared for by your ex, with him keeping them overnight because those are now additional custody days for him. And you also need to accept that you have less entitlement to child support if he is taking on more custody days.\n\n This is just how co-parenting works. Your relationship is over and your expectations are currently unreasonable. YTA.", "So, this post has established that what you want is the only thing that matters.", "So you don\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s best for your kids? Your entire post is all about how selfish you are. Grow up.", "Yeah we can see why the marriage failed.", "You think *he* wanted to?\n\nWhy do your wants trump his?", "But it's OK for the kids not to have a sense of home and stability?", "Best thing I read all morning \ud83e\udd42", "It's not even like he fucked up, they separated because they \"fought every thirty seconds.\" Yeah definitely his house still too, she had no right to kick him out."]}
