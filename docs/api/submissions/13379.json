He is 100% correct! You kicked him out, this is the direct reason why he has to drive from two towns away in rush hour traffic.

Then why not you move out and let him stay at the house and he can pick up the kids 5 out of 5 of the school days?", "YTA yes. He is clearly trying to be accommodating and considering you initiated the divorce, that is a very mature thing to do. Pay for childcare if you can't look after your children on the days you have custody, that was your decision not his.", "YTA - if you need a revised court order get one.

I mean, your reasons may be noble but still, YTA.", "YTA. How would the conversation go if the roles were reversed? Would you like to have to travel a few towns over and deal with traffic? How much of that time is actually spent with the kids and not focused on driving? It is not good for anyone, specially the kids.", "YTA - He's a couple of towns over? So he's having to drive what, 30-45 minutes each way to pick up the kids on days that aren't his usual responsibility.\n\nAnd I'm gathering it's probably often a case if getting very little notice? If that's the case then you're even more of an AH because he can't make or keep plans.", "YTA - This seems like a one-way street/double standard.

Once the divorce is finalized, you\u2019re on your own to figure out childcare on your custody days.

Not the case for everyone", "INFO Why can't he take the kids back to your house and stay with them until you come home?", "YTA You're not the only one working to support yourself and two young kids. Luke has to work also. It's not being a \"baby\" when you're doing all you can. Perhaps you and Luke need to come together and hire a sitter to help with the slack.", "YTA. While I'm sure your ex is happy to get extra time with the kids it sounds like you're still punishing him.", "YTA. Get after school care for your children. Your soon to be ex is living in a different town and you absolutely cannot expect him to picked up the children from school for you. Apologize for calling him a baby!", "YTA. It is unreasonable of you to expect your soon to be ex husband to drive two towns over to provide after school care because you can't pick them up after work, multiple times a week. You need to find a different solution, an after school program or parents or a friend or something. Alternately you need to change the custody arrangements, although that may not be feasible if you're the one living in the school district and he's two towns away, unless they move to a school in his town or he moves back into the same school district, which I'm sure he would have had that been a workable option.\n\nThis is part of the reality of separation, when you split custody you are responsible for meeting the needs of the children while they're in your custody. You have to solve the problem of work hours versus school hours just as millions of other single parents do.\n\nYou can make it easier on yourself by being the best co-parent you can be. If you are pleasant and reasonable, and willing to compromise when required (although not too much), most of the time the other person will also be fairly pleasant and reasonable, and willing to compromise. Some exes are the worst people in the world to co-parent with, but children do best when their parents can at least be polite acquaintances.\n\nFor the sake of your children, please be reasonable and respect his time. That's a perfectly reasonable request of his. Take a couple of deep breaths and find a better solution for after school care, you have broken up, that vastly diminishes the responsibility he has to you. Stop calling him names and grow up. He's not being an absent father by sticking to the custody arrangement you agreed on. Furthermore, what are you doing making it harder for him to work extra if that's what he wants to do? If he's working extra so he can help you support the kids when they're in your custody, then he's being a good dad. Get over yourself. Yes breakups suck, but you've got two kids with him. You will have to co-parent and it looks like you've got a man who is willing to do his share. Stop punishing him or whatever you think this is, and start being a decent human to him for your children's sake.", "If your job demands have changed and his haven\u2019t, then you both need to coordinate a different schedule. If he takes them every weekend all weekend, that sounds like being a present father. \n\nBeing civil and working out a system which everyone is happy with is the goal. Perhaps he takes them 3 days of the school week and every other weekend. His concerns that he is taking on too much are valid. \n\nYou\u2019re both the asshole for the petty name calling. Grow up.", "YTA", "YTA, just curious with what authority did you kick him out of the house? Do you own the house?", "YTA, you had an agreement and you are not sticking up on your part and then you mock HIM for not being fine with your failures. \n\nYou failing in sticking up on the agreement will be used against you in court by his lawyer when it comes to custody. If you would have been grateful for his help and apologised and found a better solution there would have been a chance he doesn't bring this up in court, but  the way you went about it - the man would be stupid to not use this against you to proove that you are not a reliable parent. \n\nOh, and good luck not sticking up to your end of the deal when there will be a court order in place. But you can just try to mock the judge then, lol.", "INFO - what caused you to throw him out the house , and why did he have to move so far away", "Without knowing more I'm going with YTA.\n\nA \"few towns over\" how long is that drive for him? I think a fair comprise would be to have him pick up the kids and goto your house so he can actually relax and decompress after work. \n\nOr you know, they can ride the freaking bus? I've never understood parents who are adamant about picking up and dropping off their kids everyday. It's a waste of time, gas, & energy.\n\nAlso: it makes me smile to see the comments in agreement for once lol.", "YTA and perhaps the best way to handle this is to switch living conditions. Let him live in the house (since you constantly need his help) while you find other accommodations and take the kids for the weekends.\n\nOf course, nothing should be agreed to without a court order.", "YTA, you can\u2019t depend on him to make your life flow anymore. Stick to your agreement and call upon another adult if you need help on your days.", "YTA. You need to find a babysitter or after school care.

You're a single parent now and are responsible for your kids on the days they're in your care.\n\nGet after school care arranged for the kids instead, like every other single parent does.", "YTA why should he have to spend the money on fuel to get your boys from school when he lives miles away in another town while you are closer its you that took on the extra work so how should you call him a baby. you had access to the kids all set up but now you don't care because he is a baby as he moans about picking them up when its not his job but yours. you need to get your priorities straight before you call any one a baby", "YTA.  You can't kick him out and then expect him to be your free daycare provider.  Under the circumstance, it would make a lot more sense for the kids to stay with him during the week, even if they have to change schools.  \n\nYour other choices are to modify your work schedule so that YOU can watch the kids after school every night.  Or, hire professional daycare to watch them for a few hours a day.\n\nRight now, your ex is essentially spending all his free time (week days and weekends) watching the kids.  That's only fair if he has full custody.    \n\nWhat really bothers me is this part:  \" he\u2019s also been working extra to try and send me some money to help make ends meet\"\n\nIn other words, even before you have a formal parenting plan, he's paying you child support.  Only, because of your work schedule and your demand that he watch the kids week night AND weekends, he actually has physical custody 50% or more. \n\nIt's a huge AH move to expect him to do more than half of the work of raising your kids.  And then accepting money from him to help you do the work that you have foisted off on him.  \n\nIf I was your EX, I'd probably sue for 100% physical custody.  Ironically, it would be a lot less stressful for him than the status quo.  And any family court judge would see your current situation as...you have very little time to spend with the kids anyway.  So YOU should be the one paying child support and seeing them \"every other weekend plus 6 weeks on Summer break\"", "YTA.\n\nIt's not reasonable to just tell him to pick the kids up based on what you happen to be doing.    I expect you would not appreciate if he did the same to you.\n\nAgree on your days, stick to that.  If you have an emergency, work with your ex, don't dump it on him", "ESH. Daycare or after school program will take care of the issue.", "Ok, so the split is only a few months old, you're new to coparenting. For that reason I won't be too harsh, but ESH.\n\nYou're both learning how to be single again, and how to be solo parents. The way you've written your post sounds like you expect him to drop everything when you need it. This isn't the way it works, barring an emergency. In some respects it sounds like he's helping you out with picking up the kids, but he's then complaining about it. That's not cool on his part, it'll just build resentment towards you and the kids will pick up on it.\n\nIf you haven't already, work out a parenting plan together (with lawyers if absolutely necessary, although if you can work it out amicably together I'd highly advise it). Work your schedule around your parenting plan, and stick to it. If it's absolutely necessary to ask him to go outside the parenting plan, then offer to pick up the slack for him on another day.\n\nBreakups suck, and they're even harder when there's kids. But from here on in, the main job for each of you it to love your kids more than you hate each other.,\n\nEDIT: Also, stop the namecalling - it won't make him easier to work with and again: the kids will pick up on it.

If you are planning to formally ask for 100% physical custody eventually, you are definitely setting a bad precedent.  I'd have to guess that you don't have a lawyer advising you....or you need to fire your current lawyer.", "Sounds like you're someone who would rather be right than be happy. It won't be worth it.", "Get your act together. Your soon to be ex is right and you're unreasonable. I would call people like you immature.. maybe you're the baby.", ">We can\u2019t afford after school right now.\n\nThat's a problem that you solve before you kick hubby out of the house.  It's called being a parent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> And I\u2019m sorry but if you heard the way he talks you\u2019d call him a baby too.\n\nGoing by the way he acts, he's certainly not a baby.  His ex-wife, on the other hand...seems to have a lot of catching up to do, if she wants to act as mature as her ex hubby is.", "Bet we'd have some creative words for you too. Weekdays are your parenting time therefore child care during that time is your responsibility and making him drive two towns over during rush hour for the majority of your parenting time is not reasonable. If I was him I'd be in front of a judge switching custody because clearly you aren't able to be the primary. YTA.", "It seems, the best solution would be he stays in the house and you go find yourself an apartement. That would actually minimize the extra effort he has to drive the kids all the time.", "Ok so I could understand to an extent if he had done something but this sounds like a break up where both were at fault , and you are now continuing to have conflict. You need to sit down and discuss how to sort this problem out long term as it's not fair on your children to have parents who are constantly in conflict. It sounds like he needs to move closer , or you need a better after school plan but like other commentators have said - you no longer have the right to demand anything from him on days that are your custodial time , and you are not upholding your responsibilities on those days . ESH for not planning properly how you were going to work together to care for you children and continuing to make your childrens lives filled with conflict . Stop with the name calling as well, the only person being a baby here is the adult not completing their responsibilities and that is you", "I\u2019m guessing this is actually Luke posting this and not the wife. As no one could be that unreasonable and lacking in self awareness surely?", "You should change housing. With your work hours you should go search for an apartment and he should stay at the house. That would minimize the stress for all involved.", "Is there an after-school program you can enroll your kids in?\n\nI know what it's like to be a single mom. My ex lived about 30 minutes away and saw the kids when he felt like it. I had to look for after-school care, and thankfully, the school had an after-school program from 3 to 6, and it was free. They had activities, snacks, and homework help.", "Not", "Stepping up? They are his kids. You pick them up from school. Divorce be damned. You want to complain about it then you do it in court when arguing about the money/time ratio. I am absolutely baffled by people who act like a man caring for his own kids is a chore. The same obligations you have as a father married to the mother are the same obligations you have divorced from the mother. It's fatherhood not babysitting.", "No he gets paranoid though and now that we are separated he shouldn\u2019t even care but he does and gets self conscious that I\u2019ve been talking with other men I\u2019ve met", "If she is already bringing men home, he might be upset because strange men around his kids or that was the reason for the divorce in the 1st place.", "I\u2019m not gonna ask for 100% custody I want the kids to be able to see him as well as me.", "Not defending op, she is the asshole in this situation, but have you ever been around a divorcing couple? The person that initiated the breakup very often cares alot about who the other is banging. It shouldn't bother them but...", "I don\u2019t want to move out I like my house.", "Yet you have no issue with a mother who kicked out the father from his home repeatedly failing to pick her kids against the agreement she reached with the father. Is this not also absolutely baffling?", ">The same obligations you have as a father married to the mother are the same obligations you have divorced from the mother\n\nSo why does he have to pick up extra work to give money to the mother? I thought it was either co parenting or paying child support. But both?", "Yeah.  Lots of people are under the delusion that if they get divorced with kids involved..\n\nThat their ex-spouse is mandated by law to remain celibate for the rest of their lives...", "Op says she\u2019s not bringing people over, and even then why does that give him the right to go through HER CLOTHES, and inspect them. Even if she is fucking a hundred dudes a day, as long she\u2019s not bring them around the kids, he shouldn\u2019t care, because they are no longer together", "Well, the way you describe the status quo...right now, he has about 70% physical custody AND he pays (essentially) child support.  As I've said before, this sets a bad precedent if you want to end up with the kids most of the time, like NOT being the parent that gets them every other weekend.  Get a lawyer quick, or fire your current lawyer.", "You need to ask for weekends and let him have them during the week", "I'm under the impression that she initiated everything....demanding a divorce, kicking him out of the house...\n\nAnd I'm betting if he was seeing somebody else right now, she really would not care.  \n\nAnd if she did care, that would be rather....silly.", "Literally everything in your original post and comments is about what you want and what suits you. You sound awful and entitled.", "What you like doesn't matter. What is best for your child is what matters and being dragged back and forth on a school night is not what is better.", "Yeah he probably liked his fuckin house too", "You know fair point that I added more stock to his whining about traffic and it colored my view. So maybe an ESH at best. But considering how he's reacting to picking up his own kids on a weekday I'll put odds she was right to do so. Fully possible I'm wrong on that.\n\nWeekends are far easier. There is no schedules to set, no school stuff to deal with. You set your own time on a weekend. So you really think that's as difficult as getting the up and to school 5 days a week on time. Dinner 5 days a week and bed on time to get them up. Dealing with the school work 5 days a week.\n\n5 days with rigid structure vs 2 days of a weekend? Sorry a couple after school pickups are not a big deal. And that's giving allowance that him living a couple towns over isn't his choice or is honestly a hurdle.\n\nEvery problem he has to deal with except being a town over she also has to deal with and has to deal with it 2.5x as much. Pick up the kids. Complain in court.", "She also had to pick up extra work, which is what is causing the issue with picking the kids up from school. My guess is because they are both now collectively paying double the bills they were. And 5 days a week of obligations is still more than 2 days plus 3 pick ups.", "It's OK.  I hope she doesn't change at all.  And I hope she tells the judge everything she posted here, VERBATIM.  (You bring the popcorn?)", "The issue here isn\u2019t the principle of helping with the kids. I am a Dad to two boys and I run around after them, share bedtimes, do school runs and do a full part whilst working full time - so I am unsympathetic to Dads who don\u2019t. The issue is that she expects him to pick them up 3 out of 5 days a week against their agreed schedule when she is one who is local. It says he is working extra hours to cover the additional costs after the split and has had to move some distance away. But when she needs it he has to fit in with her schedule and he is a baby if he isn\u2019t happy with dancing to her tune. 3 out of 5 days a week isn\u2019t being flexible when occasion demands it is being taken advantage of. She pushed him out and set the schedule but then ignores it when it suits her. He might well have made different living arrangements if he knew this would be the case. \n\nCustody has to be give and take and this guy does not sound like a disinterested parent. He has the kids every weekend and works hard to provide extra money to make it work. There are plenty of deadbeats out there and I think this mother just sounds entitled wanting all the compromise to be on the other side. I bet she would have a right tantrum if he had weekend plans  and asked her to step in and she couldn\u2019t get her time off.", "\"I should get primary custody, but also be able to demand my ex have the kids the majority of the time if I feel like it, but still be paid child support as if he's not doing so.  You know, whatever I feel like that day.\"\n\nThe judge may, uh, have some simpler solutions to suggest.", ">The judge may, uh, have some simpler solutions to suggest.\n\nOMG, now I've got soda all over my monitor...\n\nNot complaining though.
