Her birth resulted in my parents splitting up. Mum remarried two years later, and my dad moved away shortly after the split and wasn't really a part of my life. I always knew about Kylie but I only met her when I was 16 through my father, and while we saw each other a few times over the next few years, we never developed a relationship. \n\nFor most of the past two decades, my father has been a gambling addict. He never had much of a stable income, and definitely not a stable lifestyle. Because of this, my grandparents fulfilled all the financial stipulations in his divorce. They paid for my education, paid child support to my mother, and set up a trust fund which I got when I was 21. This was all an unofficial arrangement, and they did not do this for Kylie. I met my fianc\u00e9 at 19, so I have never used any of the money in the trust fund. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I was at my dad's for dinner (we live in the same city) and he said that Kylie had asked for my phone number. I said it was okay to give it to her. My dad also mentioned that Kylie is now pregnant.\n\nA few days after this I got a call from Kylie. She explained that she is working a minimum wage job and living in accommodation that will be unsuitable when she gives birth. She said that since I had a trust fund that she also should have got, I should split it with her so that her child doesn't have go through what she did. I was totally blindsided by this and said I would think about it. She called me every day after that, saying how she had a lot of expenses now she was pregnant and guilt-tripping me saying the family owes her. I talked to my grandfather and he said while it's my money, he thinks I'd be an idiot to hand out large sums of money to someone I don't know and who only wants to know me because she wants money. Ultimately I felt he was right and told Kylie I wouldn't be splitting the money with her. She started screaming at me, calling me selfish and spoilt, and basically dumped 20 years of trauma at my door because I had the audacity to be born. She also said it will be my fault if something happens to her baby or if he/she grows up poor. I hung up the phone and cried.\n\nMy grandparents and fianc\u00e9 say I've done the right thing. My dad said he's offered to give Kylie some money but he doesn't have access to the kind of money in the trust fund because of his addiction, but he says I'm not to blame and that Kylie isn't my responsibility. That said, the things she said about her life and about her child's future were so awful I can't stop thinking about it. I don't think I'm the AH for not wanting to give huge amounts of money to a virtual stranger, especially one who was so demanding and rude to me, but I also don't like to think I'm punishing an innocent unborn child for who their mother is.

Your sister probably had to live without all those things- of course she feels anger and resentment!! Her behavior toward you is not appropriate but likely the result of a lifetime of feeling unwanted and unsupported.  Op you are the golden child and you have the opportunity to help that lonely rejected sibling. Go to your grandparents.

Ostracizing one of their grandchildren because of things their parents did is bullying and it's gross when rich old people bully children.  They're bad people and I do think you're old enough to know that. That said, supporting your half sister you barely know is not your job.

People are just seeing her as money-grubbing instead of seeing the nuances of her situation. She grew up illegitimate and poor, and sees her legitimate sister growing up with everything as a teenager. The fact the trust fund was ever discussed with her was the fuck up, piling on more resentment. But she was pretty candid pleading she didn't want her child to grow up like her.

It was granted because OP's dad basically abandoned her.", "Why is it the grandparents responsibility? They took care of a grandchild they know. Sounds like dad had an affair with someone in another country. If he had kids all over the globe, is that the grandparents responsibility too?", "We know that they knew Kylie existed, they knew that he wasn\u2019t able to pay child support.

Her thoughts need to be on diapers, formula, groceries, and reliable transportation.  Everything else needs to be put WAYYYYYYY on the back burner.  It doesn't sound like Kylie is in that head space yet...not even close.  Kylie didn't beg.  Kylie did the exact opposite.  She demanded half and she demanded it all at once.  If you are older you should be reading between the lines better.  The OP could give half today and it would likely be squandered.  Then Kylie would say \"well you are just sitting on your half and you aren't even planning to have a baby yet so how about some more help?\"  Then Kylie could become a dangerous person.

Plus that money was put there for you by your grandparents, if they wanted her to have it they would have given her one too. Dont let her use you.", "The entitlement of some people, in this case an estranged half sibling who has had in 8 years maybe 3 or 4 contacts with their sibling and gets it in their head that they are owed half of a sizable trust fund.  Just wow.", "NTA. You were an option not the cause for the issues. Option closed. \n\nAlso, if you gave anything at all, you\u2019d have a leech attached to you. Trust me, it won\u2019t stop there.", "NTA\nHopping on top comment, what the heck are the grandparents doing for Kylie? All things considered she is their granddaughter as well.", "You\u2019re not the asshole- but your dad is. I mean he just totally left her out to dry. The fact your granddad who I think set you up but has nothing for his other granddaughter is pretty telling too.  He even called his sons daughter a stranger? \n\nBut they\u2019re right- her hardship is on your dad and his folks for not treating her equally. It\u2019s not on you to make up for them.  \n\nWhy don\u2019t they? Did you dad have so little involvement that his parents don\u2019t even see her as grandchild?", "And even if she wanted to keep the baby while not necessarily being able to \u201cafford\u201d it, people find ways for that choice to work without making  it someone else\u2019s financial responsibility, or making it someone else\u2019s problem. She doesn\u2019t get to demand money simply because she is pregnant. I\u2019m baffled she\u2019s trying to blame OP for her trauma. OP seems to have her own trauma too because of their dad.", "Sorry but I know some women that got pregnant using IUD. At least one was super angry about it. It was planning to go NC with her boyfriend.\n\nI think the real assholes here are the father and grandfather", "I very much doubt my dad is behind it. He lives a pretty comfortable life on my grandparents' dime, I doubt he'd risk them finding out he's involved in this and losing everything when he doesn't want for anything.\n\nKylie has known about the trust for years, since we were teens. I don't remember if my dad told her or I did at some point, but I don't remember her not knowing about it.", "dad's parents", "Perfect post...could not have said it better...nta.. block kylie..she is responsible for her choices", "Yeah I cannot blame Kylie for being pissed that her family treated her as second-class for reasons entirely beyond her control. Sure, that might not be OP's fault, but of course she resents the differences in how she and OP were treated.", "I don\u2019t know, she sort of sounds 21, pregnant, completely unsupported and scared out of her mind to me.  I\u2019ve been there and I don\u2019t blame her for that.  \n\nThat said, her calling OP and demanding part of the trust fund is beyond the pale, and there is no way OP should share it!", "Lmao, what responsibility is he taking? He didn\u2019t even bother paying child support for his children and still being supported by his parents and couldn\u2019t be bothered to make sure both his daughters grew up with the same resources and opportunities b/c that was his responsibility as a parent and protecting his other daughter from the bully grandparents who are punishing her for his problems when all she did was being born.", "You grandparents are trash. I would be ashamed of having a good relationship with people like that ..", "Fair point. Still NTA.", "You grandparents keep enabling their adcted son even after he didn't met his obligations with Kylie, they keep getting worse. What a wonderful family you have! /s", "How did Kylie even know about a private arraignment between the grandparents and OP? I'm guessing the dad was hoping OP would give her a lump sum that he could talk Kylie into sharing.", ">Seriously, they have the same grandparents, why was there not a trust fund set up for her. Kylie probably has had use of their money all her life and has probably abused it.\n\nI don't think that was the situation. I think what happened is that OP's mom got this in lieu of child support when divorcing OP's dad for the cheating, and that Kylie's mom didn't take things to court or make any kind of deal. OP's grandparents probably did the trust fund to both take care of the grandbaby they knew and to keep OP's dad from going to jail for unpaid child support. I'd bet they would have done the same for Kylie if her mom would have made similar demands...or maybe Kylie's mom did get a monthly payoff...but blew it. It doesn't sound like Kylie had any sort of good parenting/responsibility considering that she's pregnant and facing homelessness at 21.", "They don't have the same mom so they don't have all the same grandparents.  It must be OP's mother's parents who set her up financially otherwise Kylie would have a trust fund too.", "Or her dead beat dad, who couldn\u2019t be trusted to look after one daughter, was so not involved in kylie\u2019s life that even her grandparents, who have been generous to OP, describe her as a stranger?", "some posts like this the dad is like you should share the trust fund OP its family then gets mad when OP doesnt", "Maybe he's telling her not to share the money so she'll be able to support him in his old age. I hope I'm wrong, but I know someone whose mother-in-law told her to be careful with an inheritance because mil had her eye on getting some benefit from it. I'd didn't happen, though.", "I have not seen enough comments like this one! Yes kylie is absolutely TA for the way she\u2019s behaved but seriously put yourself in her situation. She has been completely abandoned by all her dads family including her own father and treated differently all her life because of who her mother is - she did not choose to be born! Why are OPs grandparents treating her any less than the grandchild she is? It is absolutely not Kylie\u2019s fault for her dads affair and she shouldn\u2019t have been made to feel like it was her whole life by her own grandparents.\n\nYes OP should not share her trust fund with Kylie particularly the way she\u2019s been acting about it and Kylie is not entitled to OPs trust fund but her grandparents are definitely assholes for not providing all their grandchildren with equal opportunity and blaming her for her parents actions. \n\nAlso Kylie saying about the child being born in poverty while this is not OPs responsibility OP got all her education costs provided plus money on top while Kylie obviously never got this opportunity and likely couldn\u2019t afford college because of this so of course she will be pissed at OP for getting all this \u201chanded\u201d to her by their mutual grandparents. I am absolutely not justifying Kylie\u2019s actions I just think more people should try to see it from her perspective as well. And of course the stress of a new baby/ medical bills will be added pressure for her rn all the time knowing if it was OP she wouldn\u2019t even have to consider this financial burden because their grandparents chose to provide for one grandchild and not the other. \n\nThis is honestly such a horrible situation and it\u2019s so sad and frustrating that OPs grandparents refuse to accept Kylie and their unborn great grandchild for absolutely no reason other than the circumstances of her birth. Honestly I would like to see OP stand up for Kylie to her grandparents in this respect tbh! (Obviously I realise that is not likely to happen)", "The father was not with the half sister, he abandoned both. \n\nAnd the father does owe her 18 years of child support.", ">I\u2019m quite shocked how sensible biodad\u2019s response was.  \n>  \n>Usually in these stories the parent is laying on the guilt along with the step sibling.  \n>  \n>Good on him, I guess?\n\nOne of the smartest people I know has an addiction to gambling, outside of her addiction to gambling, she generally gives the best advice and is the most rational person I know. It's really weird how addiction works? I wonder how OP's dad would have been if not for his addiction and poor impulse control.", "Good on the deadbeat dad who couldn\u2019t be trusted to look after one daughter and didn\u2019t even try with the other?  OP is not the asshole, but there is one in the story..", "What a disgusting AH this grandparents...", "Because Kylie is an \"affair child\" and some people would think she is \"less than\" for It. It's totally possible that OP was favored by the grandparents because she's a \"true\" grandchild.", "\" They don't support cheating so therefore the other sister didn't get their support\" this is the most disgusting thing I ever read. They didn't recognized their own GRANDCHILD (she's their grandchild Just as much as OP) because of something that wasn't her fault? Make It make sense...", "Caring for all but one of your grandchildren is a massive AH move. \n\nAnd Kylie is in the same country as OP. He moved after she was born, abandoning both of them.", "I agree here. Even if she is their granddaughter by blood doesn\u2019t mean they have to give her money. She is basically a stranger for them so why should they set a trust for her?", "He also a abandoned Kylie not just OP. OP is NTA but the dad and grandparents for sure are for favoring OP and her cousin over Kylie she deserves the same treatment as the rest of them. She did not get the same opportunities as the rest so obviously she\u2019s not gonna be in the same point at life as them. It sucks for Kylie that she was born and is punished for it while the dad who is responsible for it still getting supported by the grandparents", "OP's father also abandoned Kylie but they didn't have af about that...", "yes, my mother was like this. she gambled for more than 30 yrs before she passed.", "Thats cause addiction isn't a choice, it's an illness. We wouldn't be surprised if someone with cancer was rational and gave good life advice.", "Dad\u2019s an asshole for his affair and failure to contribute to raising his kids in a healthy, happy, environment. But he gets some points for awareness that\u2019s he\u2019s the fuckup and OP has no responsibility to her half sister.\n\nAs I said I\u2019m mostly surprised at his reaction because it\u2019s different from what we usually see in these type of stories.\n\nOP\u2019s dad ain\u2019t a Saint, but I found it interesting he said the correct thing.", "It would make sense", "Agreed, quite possibly they felt bad that their son had hurt OP's mother and wanted to \"make it right\" but felt no similar obligation to the \"hussy\" that he had the affair with.\n\nAlso, OP's mother and father were married, so child support was going to be part of any divorce order. It sounds like grandparents stepped in when they saw their son defaulting on the terms of that order. Kylie's mother may not have pursued any legal remedies and therefore nothing to motivate the grandparents to step in. (And, if that's the case, while it's easy to say Kylie's mother \"should have\" pursued legal remedies, that's a complicated decision and there could be a lot we don't know.)", "Agreed. But even then it\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault with whatever is going on with Kylie.", "This. OP's dad obviously sucks, but her grandparents may be even worse - they are enabling and supporting their son's addiction and his being a deadbeat father, but only supporting one of his two abandoned kids. That's messed up.", "OP says her mother didn't persue child support either. And this is not about the child support but the trustfund ALL they grandchildren but Kylie had. OP's dad is a unenployed gambler and changes countries when they were babies. Kind of dificult of getting child support. And even If they think Kylie's mother were a \"hussy\" they grandchild didn't mean anything to them ?", "You father and your grandparents are AH's. Kylie is better off this shitty people in your life. I Hope she sue your dad for everything he owns her and her mom...", "This all came from the grandparents, its their money to choose who they gave it to and is not their responsibility to set a trust for kylie if they don\u2019t want, especially if they basically dont know her?", "Handing cash all at once to an individual is rarely the effective way to make a real difference.  Sometimes it actually makes their decisions much worse.  This was true during my best years, my worst years, and those in between.  It would be true if I won the powerball.  There is not one person in this world I would hand a lump sum.  That invites very bad things to happen for all parties concerned.  Smaller incremental help over a long time is the way to do it.", "How are the grandparents shitty? They aren't obligated to do anything for their grandchildren,  it's a privilege.", "I agree!", "How about OP? Does that include OP? OP is getting handed a lump sum. Will their life become worse? Because if so, they should really quickly get rid of the money. Maybe Kylie wouldn't mind the trouble.", "If you don't think it's shitty to set up a trust fund for ALL your grandchildren except one , just because of the circunstances of her birth, you are not a good person. No one is saying they are \"obligated\" to do anything but they didn't even recognize their own GRANDCHILD. It's disgusting, plain and simple.", "If I were her grandfather I would have bought her a 50 year annuity with at least a ten percent penalty for early withdrawal.  That way, she would never want to pay it unless she was physically disabled and needed home nurses.  What the grandfather chose to do instead has made her a target for all sorts of nasty things...starting with Kylie but I doubt ending with Kylie."]}
