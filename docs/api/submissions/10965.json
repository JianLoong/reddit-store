Her birth resulted in my parents splitting up. Mum remarried two years later, and my dad moved away shortly after the split and wasn't really a part of my life. I always knew about Kylie but I only met her when I was 16 through my father, and while we saw each other a few times over the next few years, we never developed a relationship. \n\nFor most of the past two decades, my father has been a gambling addict. He never had much of a stable income, and definitely not a stable lifestyle. Because of this, my grandparents fulfilled all the financial stipulations in his divorce. They paid for my education, paid child support to my mother, and set up a trust fund which I got when I was 21. This was all an unofficial arrangement, and they did not do this for Kylie. I met my fianc\u00e9 at 19, so I have never used any of the money in the trust fund. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I was at my dad's for dinner (we live in the same city) and he said that Kylie had asked for my phone number. I said it was okay to give it to her. My dad also mentioned that Kylie is now pregnant.\n\nA few days after this I got a call from Kylie. She explained that she is working a minimum wage job and living in accommodation that will be unsuitable when she gives birth. She said that since I had a trust fund that she also should have got, I should split it with her so that her child doesn't have go through what she did. I was totally blindsided by this and said I would think about it. She called me every day after that, saying how she had a lot of expenses now she was pregnant and guilt-tripping me saying the family owes her. I talked to my grandfather and he said while it's my money, he thinks I'd be an idiot to hand out large sums of money to someone I don't know and who only wants to know me because she wants money. Ultimately I felt he was right and told Kylie I wouldn't be splitting the money with her. She started screaming at me, calling me selfish and spoilt, and basically dumped 20 years of trauma at my door because I had the audacity to be born. She also said it will be my fault if something happens to her baby or if he/she grows up poor. I hung up the phone and cried.\n\nMy grandparents and fianc\u00e9 say I've done the right thing. My dad said he's offered to give Kylie some money but he doesn't have access to the kind of money in the trust fund because of his addiction, but he says I'm not to blame and that Kylie isn't my responsibility. That said, the things she said about her life and about her child's future were so awful I can't stop thinking about it. I don't think I'm the AH for not wanting to give huge amounts of money to a virtual stranger, especially one who was so demanding and rude to me, but I also don't like to think I'm punishing an innocent unborn child for who their mother is.

This is the situation your grandparents have created. It\u2019s shameful that they set up a trust fund for you that you have not even needed this far and yet their other granddaughter -AND GREAT GRANDCHILD!- are struggling and they instruct you not to share. This girl was born through no fault of her own. She did not cause your dad to cheat, his addiction, or any of his problems. And yet your grandparents seem to want to punish her.

Your sister probably had to live without all those things- of course she feels anger and resentment!! Her behavior toward you is not appropriate but likely the result of a lifetime of feeling unwanted and unsupported.  Op you are the golden child and you have the opportunity to help that lonely rejected sibling. Go to your grandparents.

Nothing to do with \u201chelping all the babies around your city\u201d my god lol.", "We're not doing a pre nup, but if we were it would be my fianc\u00e9 protecting his assets from me haha", "Yes, they're my father's parents.", "I guess my dad told her? Or maybe I did when we were teenagers? I remember her mentioning it when I was about to turn 21, so she knew about it a long time ago, but I don't remember who told her.", "It's not true my grandparents gave me the fund because of the divorce. All my cousins have trust funds. What my grandparents did in the divorce was pay child support.\n\nI'm not sure how she knows about the trust fund, but she's known for years. Either my dad told her, or I did, years ago, I don't remember. But it's not new information to her.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I may be an AH, but being in a relationship both parties are happy with isn't the reason.", "Why does OP suck?  What did she do wrong?  I think if anything the entitled step sister, her dad and to a lesser extent the grandparents are the AH!", "She isn\u2019t looking for emotional support she\u2019s DEMANDING her trust fund-big difference.", "My fianc\u00e9 has financially supported me since I graduated university, so I've never used the trust money. Sorry that wasn't clear, I think I had to delete some words because of the character limit so the sentence became unintelligible.", "I have seen her a few time in the last few years. I don't remember how she found out about the fund, either my dad mentioned it, or I did over when we were teenagers, but she's known about it for years.", " \nThis is one case when you should listen to your father. You are not to blame and Kylie is not your responsibility.", "And why didn't she ask her grandparents about 'her' trust fund? She probably knew that they'd say no.", "Seriously, they have the same grandparents, why was there not a trust fund set up for her. Kylie probably has had use of their money all her life and has probably abused it.", "If the parents were married this sub would be screaming about favoritism.", "They are OP's paternal grandparents which means that Kylie is as much their granddaughter as OP is. Based on OP's other comments they are basically favoring OP (and her cousins) over Kylie simply because she was born out of wedlock.\n\nSo yes, I do think they are AHs who are punishing Kylie for the sins of her father.", "I hope you recognise that the grandparents you respect so much are despicable monsters.\n\nChoosing to cut your father off because of his extramarital affairs is a choice they can make, but refusing to support his child who is the product of this extramarital affair is despicable.\n\nThey chose to punish an innocent child (Kylie) for the actions of her parents. Sure, take their money. Do whatever you want. Just know they\u2019re not good people and Kylie has been dealt a bad hand in life.", "It sounds like the only way she'd be happy upon receiving a baby box is if it was filled with cash or gold (I'm picturing a pirate chest of doubloons). I can just see poor OP getting yelled at for giving her diapers and a blanket because those items aren't legal tender.", "You can tell by the wording in their comment English is clearly not their first language", "Question:  is there a reason your grandparents didn\u2019t establish a similar trust for Kylie?", "Right? They gave her bread and let her sister starve. Hell they gave her a whole bakery and her sister can\u2019t even get a crumb.", "The Father wiped his hands if the child and was with the half sister. The grandparents stepped in where he failed.  It wasn\u2019t their responsibility to do so and are not assholes because they let the son handle the responsibility for the other.\n\nAt this point, the half sister is an adult and no one owes her anything. The Father admitted he would help where able but can\u2019t to an extent that makes her happy. She needs to be an adult and grow up.", "Well said. Your grandparents are MASSIVE assholes.", "I don't know for sure, because they've never mentioned it. I know they take the view that extramarital affairs shouldn't happen and if they do they shouldn't been spoken of. From this I kind of guessed that they think Kylie's mother shouldn't have gone through with the pregnancy, but again, they've never said that. But they've never even met Kylie and never mentioned her as far as I know. The conversation I had with my grandfather about her wanting money was the first conversation I've had with him about her.", "I\u2019m not 100% sure but the phrase because of this my grandparents fulfilled all the financial stipulations of the divorce suggests it\u2019s paternal.  As if it was maternal the phrasing likely would have been my dad didn\u2019t pay any child support so my grandparents helped my mom.  Referring to the divorce agreement itself suggests the fathers side.\n\nBut that would change my comments as the maternal grandparents wouldn\u2019t have an obligation.", "Please write your lawmakers to support pro-choice rights.", "Yeah, no. It's not up to OP to solve her sister's problems. Furthermore, if she gives in an inch, her sister would ask for more and more. The best thing would be for OP to just block her sister and live her life.", "I don't think Kylie has been treated fairly, however I have enough respect for what my grandfather has achieved and enough knowledge of what I haven't to be telling him what to do with his money. It's not my place. Neither I nor Kylie nor any of my cousins is entitled to a penny of it, so I would never take a stand on what he chooses to do with it. To be honest, if I chose to give Kylie the money it would be in spite of thinking it might disrespect my grandparents, not because of that reason.\n\nAnd yes, I have a relationship with my grandparents because whether I agree with all their views or not, they're people who contribute a lot to my life and always have, and I don't mean financially. I have a relationship with my dad for a similar reason - he has a part to play in my life, even if that part isn't what it should have been. If I spent my whole life shutting people out because of what they're not, I'd miss the value of what they can bring to my life. That's my personal philosophy.", "Honestly, it\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to treat her fairly. It\u2019s on her father and grandparents.", "I was thinking, perhaps more out of concern for her niece, as opposed to her greedy sister. In spite of a family rift I would never want a child to suffer.", "That's your right, of course. But it's also incredibly weak and transparent in my view. That your \"personal philosophy\" allows you to profit while skipping over the fact that your grandparents are acting like complete trash in this scenario is...telling. I'm not saying I can't be bought (lol, I definitely can for some things), but I would at least recognize that I'm sort of being trash myself.\n\nSome people need to be shamed because their behavior is shameful. Even if we love them."]}
