Her birth resulted in my parents splitting up. Mum remarried two years later, and my dad moved away shortly after the split and wasn't really a part of my life. I always knew about Kylie but I only met her when I was 16 through my father, and while we saw each other a few times over the next few years, we never developed a relationship. \n\nFor most of the past two decades, my father has been a gambling addict. He never had much of a stable income, and definitely not a stable lifestyle. Because of this, my grandparents fulfilled all the financial stipulations in his divorce. They paid for my education, paid child support to my mother, and set up a trust fund which I got when I was 21. This was all an unofficial arrangement, and they did not do this for Kylie. I met my fianc\u00e9 at 19, so I have never used any of the money in the trust fund. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I was at my dad's for dinner (we live in the same city) and he said that Kylie had asked for my phone number. I said it was okay to give it to her. My dad also mentioned that Kylie is now pregnant.\n\nA few days after this I got a call from Kylie. She explained that she is working a minimum wage job and living in accommodation that will be unsuitable when she gives birth. She said that since I had a trust fund that she also should have got, I should split it with her so that her child doesn't have go through what she did. I was totally blindsided by this and said I would think about it. She called me every day after that, saying how she had a lot of expenses now she was pregnant and guilt-tripping me saying the family owes her. I talked to my grandfather and he said while it's my money, he thinks I'd be an idiot to hand out large sums of money to someone I don't know and who only wants to know me because she wants money. Ultimately I felt he was right and told Kylie I wouldn't be splitting the money with her. She started screaming at me, calling me selfish and spoilt, and basically dumped 20 years of trauma at my door because I had the audacity to be born. She also said it will be my fault if something happens to her baby or if he/she grows up poor. I hung up the phone and cried.\n\nMy grandparents and fianc\u00e9 say I've done the right thing. My dad said he's offered to give Kylie some money but he doesn't have access to the kind of money in the trust fund because of his addiction, but he says I'm not to blame and that Kylie isn't my responsibility. That said, the things she said about her life and about her child's future were so awful I can't stop thinking about it. I don't think I'm the AH for not wanting to give huge amounts of money to a virtual stranger, especially one who was so demanding and rude to me, but I also don't like to think I'm punishing an innocent unborn child for who their mother is.

This is the situation your grandparents have created. It\u2019s shameful that they set up a trust fund for you that you have not even needed this far and yet their other granddaughter -AND GREAT GRANDCHILD!- are struggling and they instruct you not to share. This girl was born through no fault of her own. She did not cause your dad to cheat, his addiction, or any of his problems. And yet your grandparents seem to want to punish her. Think about how many sources of support you have in your life that even ensured you had the support you did. You mention your mom had child support and this trust fund. Your sister probably had to live without all those things- of course she feels anger and resentment!! Her behavior toward you is not appropriate but likely the result of a lifetime of feeling unwanted and unsupported.  Op you are the golden child and you have the opportunity to help that lonely rejected sibling. Go to your grandparents.

A stranger is not entitled to your money bc she's pregnant.", "NTA. This is a case when you should listen to your dad. You are not to blame and Kylie is not your responsibility. He's right.", ">perhaps a compassionate child care allowance or an educational fund would be a nice idea.\n\nOp is only 22. Even if the fund is huge, she needs that money for her life. She will probably have kids, need a house, college funds for her kids.", "Yeah she's the spoiled brat in this scenerio. Don't feel guilty about it OP. And besides, your family supports your decision", "Lashing out at people just because your situation is bad makes you a jerk", "> My dad said he's offered to give Kylie some money but he doesn't have access to the kind of money in the trust fund because of his addiction, but he says I'm not to blame and that Kylie isn't my responsibility.\n\nEven the dad is telling OP not to do it. Very nice to see a father take responsibility", "\r  \nNo, the girl seems to be manipulated", "This. Why is everyone overlooking the fact that this one grandchild was supported in every way- and obviously had other sources of support as she hasn\u2019t even touched the trust fund!! But the other granddaughter is financially bereft and the grandparents say absolutely don\u2019t share!! What pieces of work. Obviously op has been brought up with at least some resentment- after all she starts the post by saying her sister was the result of an affair that ended her parents\u2019 marriage- but this seems to have blatantly been fed to her by her grandparents who must also feel that way and that they are going to punish the resulting child. Heartless.  OP is NTA but your grandparents are trash.", "She was abandoned by her father and grand parents.  \n\nNot much stands between the OP graduating from college and Kylie pregnant and asking for money other than the behaviour of the father and grand parents.\n\nOwn damn fault is harsh judgement when the people who funded one child didn\u2019t fund the other.\n\nThe OP doesn\u2019t have an obligation but her grandparents are awful people", "so much this\n\nOP is not the AH, but her grandparents absolutely are. They have trust fund kind of money and their direct great grandchild is about to be born into poverty to a young mother, their granddaughter, who they've neglected for 20 years because she is a \"bastard\" child, what kind of Victorian hell is this\n\nOP, you might not be obligated to share the money, but it is the absolutely right thing to do. It's your grandparents' money that you never expected or asked for and now you will redirect part of it to where they should have this entire time", "I did finish reading btw.  Giving her Mom money would hurt the child because the Mom would never grow. She\u2019d learn that using people or brow beating them to get what she wants works and continue.. likely giving it to her child.  She needs more value and fulfillment than that will give.\n\nIf you still feel for them, prepare a list of charities that may help her.", "The grandparents and father are huge assholes though.  They prioritized one grandchild over the other.  Abandoning one leading to the current situation while funding the other.   Then they wash their hands of it now.", "Yes, they're my father's parents. My father didn't pay child support as far as I know. He didn't have an income so I'm not sure if he'd have had to even if he'd been taken to court, if they could find him, since he basically travelled from party city to party city for the decade after I was born. My mum never sued him for any because my grandparents offered to pay, I don't know if Kylie's mum tried to sue.\n\nMy grandparents take a *very* dim view of messy affairs. They dealt with it by pretending the whole thing never happened. Even now they refer to my parents' divorce being because of my dad's lifestyle at the time rather than the affairs.", "Respectfully, I don't see my father doing that. He has a very comfortable life thanks to my grandparents. He may not have a lump sum of cash or assets but he's not hurting for money. \n\nKylie has known about my trust fund for years. When I saw her shortly before turning 21 she joked about me getting it soon.", "If the fund has $20m in it $200 a month for childcare for a few years is easily doable as is as is 15k a year for 4 years of higher education. This small amount of dispersement would have a negligible impact on the value of the fund.", "I don't resent Kylie. My father had had several affairs, but him having another child was the final straw for my mother, she has said that. I've had a lifetime of therapy, I'm not angry at Kylie for existing, or my dad for being an addict and general degenerate, or my mum for leaving. People just are how they are.\n\nMy grandparents refuse to even acknowledge the affairs because they think affairs shouldn't happen and if they do they should never be spoken about. To this day they say my parents split because of my dad's \"lifestyle\".", "Maybe I missed it, but was it confirmed that the grandparents were the parents of the dad, and therefore, also the grandparents to Kylie? Or could it have been her mother's parents, who would then clearly not want to fund their daughter's ex-husband's child from an extra-marital affair?", "I get that but it's still quite stupid to shit out a kid when you're not in a position to take care of it", "Geez, no offense but your grandparents and father are AHs\n\nYou're NTA but you sound like being worried about Kylie might be something that sticks with you.  You should get an opinion from a professional and not reddit.", "If he has a comfortable life, why doesn't your half sister move in with him until she gets on her feet. He is about to be a grandfather. He should step up and help this child he created. He can at least put a comfortable roof over her head. NTA", "Also respectfully, your father has an addiction.  Your grandparents only hand over so much and no more.  Don't let him fool you into thinking he wouldn't take your last dime for this addiction.", "If you don\u2019t resent her do you think she has been treated fairly? You still hang out and have a relationship with grandparents that basically refuse to recognize her as a part of their family?? Again it\u2019s not your job to right the wrongs of your family but if it were me that trust fund money would feel so dirty, given to me by morally bankrupt grandparents that treat their grandchild like trash. How would it feel to grow up knowing your grandparents wish so hard that you didn\u2019t exist that they pretend it\u2019s true. Just you. Not your sister that they give gifts and money to. How painful would that be? Maybe if you made a show of splitting the money it would send a message to your grandparents that you don\u2019t support their disgusting favoritism and it\u2019s time for them to grow up.", "We live in a different country to them, I doubt Kylie could just move here.\n\nAlso, the apartment he lives in is owned by my grandparents, I'm not sure how they'd feel about it.", "Sounds like a them problem, not a you problem. She seems to have no problem asking for things as if she is entitled to them. She is more entitled to help from her parents than from a half sister she barely knows and has no relationship with.\n\nYour father could send her some of the support he gets from his parents instead of gambling it all away. They are all adults, and have made their own choices. It's not your mess to straighten out."]}
