We became friends mid 2022, & been close ever since. She\u2019s met my mother before & we\u2019ve hung out by ourselves on some occasions, but we\u2019re ONLY friends. \n\nAround November, a friend of mine (Jason 16M - we\u2019ve been friends for close to 5 years) started to pay attention to Alicia. He\u2019d flirt with her in front of me but I paid it no mind because I knew that Alicia & I didn\u2019t have that type of relationship. \n\nJason and I was otp in a gc call in mid December, and Alicia came up as a topic. I joked that she was pretty to me, but I wasn\u2019t interested in her. Jason stopped talking to me for about two days, till he finally told me that him and Alicia were dating and what I said was wrong. \n\nI apologized because I didn\u2019t know, and we sort of made up from there. \n\nTwo weeks ago, Alicia and Jason broke up.  Alicia broke up with Jason and Alicia is doing fine but Jason is a forbidden topic around her. \n\nBefore Jason came along, I had a friend group of Me, Alicia, Gracie and Seth. When Jason started dating Alicia, her contact with me & Seth limited but we had no choice to respect that. \n\nShe told us that it was because Jason was insecure about it, and she did what she thought she had to do. She did apologize.\n\nNow, to the main problem \u2014 two nights ago Alicia, Me, Gracie and Seth went to see a movie and go out to eat. Of course, like teenagers we posted it and made tiktoks. We sat in duals, Me and Alicia & Gracie and Seth (they\u2019ve been dating for a year.) \n\nJason slid up on my instagram stories, calling me weird for hanging out with Alicia. He asked if I was trying to get his scraps and I defended Alicia and said that we was just a friend group hanging out during the summer.\n\nNow, the friend group I\u2019m in with Jason is split up between if I\u2019m in the wrong or not. I don\u2019t think that I am because Alicia was my friend before Jason decided to pursue my best friend. And due to what caused their breakup, if i had to choose sides I\u2019d choose Alicia\u2019s. But I would like to get second opinions. \n\nAlso, these are fake names & Alicia is truly like a sister to me. Nothing has ever nor will ever happen between us except for platonic things.", "created_utc": 1687335002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f1hhg/aita_for_still_hanging_out_with_my_best_friend/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not the first time people thought Alicia and I were dating. But Alicia is truly a friend and I can hang out with who I please. \n2) I feel like the asshole because my friends are telling me that Jason feels genuinely hurt and I know that our five year friendship may not ever recover, or even mend itself. I feel like I might be possibly selfish for not apologizing but I feel like I\u2019m in the clear and Jason is just feeling sad.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are all still quite young so hopefully he can grow up but, for now, just know that he is causing problems in a friend group because he is unhappy about what happened but not mature enough to accept any responsibility.\n\nIf I were to guess the friend group you and Jason are in is split along loyalty lines that don't necessarily mesh with the facts of the situation - including ideas Jason has planted which implicates you as part of the reason he and Alicia are no longer together. You might want to find out from someone you trust if Jason is saying things like that because that might explain the nonsensical reaction (they all should have taken your side imo).", "NTA\n\nAnyone who limits their girlfriend\u2019s contact with her friends, calls her their \u2018scraps\u2019 post-breakup and/or insists you adhere to some BS bro code when your friendship with her predates their relationship is automatically the AH.", "Jason had no regard for your feelings whe he decided to date your friend and make it obvious that he didn't want her hanging out with you. Now that they're no longer together, he can't manipulate her into avoiding you so he's manipulating you into avoiding her. He doesn't get to dictate who you can and cannot be friends with, regardless. He accepted the consequences of dating his buddy's best friend when he made that choice and that's his problem. Don't let this guy call the shots for your relationships with other people. NTA", "Jason sounds very insecure. The way he\u2019s talking to you, do you really want to be friends with someone like that? Just because you\u2019ve known him a while is not enough of a reason to stay friends with someone who tries to control you. Take a step back from him for now. If you\u2019re meant to be friends it will happen again in the future. Life is too short for all that drama.", "NTA ofc, \n\n1. jason kind of lured you into a trap when he began talking about Alicia and you called her pretty (which is ok, why would there be a problem with that) then followed by getting angry at you for not knowing?\n\n2. when jason and alicia were dating he limited the contact between her, you, and seth (assuming because you are both boys) which poses as an issue. \n\n3. it kind of sounds like jason was trying to get you to choose between him and alicia. \n\nid say that jason might have issues with confidence or something like that. hang out with whoever you want and if he has an issue with that then screw him. enjoy your summer man.", "NTA. If your friend of 5 years feels he has to keep his girlfriend away from you, and you've never done anything to betray his trust, he's not a good friend, or a good boyfriend. \n\nIt's socially healthy to have friends of the opposite sex. People are more than a prospective romantic partner only, no matter their gender. The more diverse your friends group, the more well-rounded you'll grow to be.", "NTA you did nothing wrong. \nYour friend Jason just isn\u2019t over Alicia yet. I would recommend to talk to him in person about all of this.", "NTA\n\n\nJason needs to grow up and realise it's not a thing to ban friends seeing friends.", "15 year old drama.

You're doing the right thing by staying out of it, but Jason is hurting and people have a tendency to hit out if they don't know how to deal with that (and I'm not saying this to be dismissive or condescending at all, but I work with teenagers and I've seen this a million times) especially teenage boys.\n\n I would recommend you talk to Jason. If you don't feel he'll listen to you, send him a message. Explain that you're sorry that his feelings are hurt, but that this isn't your fight and you're not going to take sides. You were friends with both of them before they got together, and their break up doesn't make you care about either of them any less. Tell him that you and Alicia are just friends and that you're there for her through the breakup, but you're there for him too. \n\nYou could always suggest a social media break between the two of you if seeing your posts is affecting his mental health. If that's a boundary he needs to put in place, you understand, but you hope that you'll still hang out/ text/ call, because you care about him and want to be his friend.", "You\u2019re all still teenagers and this was probably Jason\u2019s first \u2018serious\u2019 relationship. His comments are coming from a place of insecurity and hurt feelings. \n\nIn high school I had all kinds of issues with friends over romantic relationships, even though I only dated one guy until I was in college. I had one friend who apparently hated me even though I didn\u2019t know it till years later because she had a \u2018thing\u2019 with one of my guy friends who abruptly stopped talking to her, and then she heard we were hanging out (because we were friends but there wasn\u2019t ever anything going on between us, he was my brother, and I was literally dating someone else, who was also friends with him and was cool with our friendship) but I could tell you a dozen other stories just like this. Y\u2019all are young and going through confusing times that\u2019ll come with a lot of lessons. \n\nAll of that is to say don\u2019t take Jason\u2019s words seriously. Yes his feelings matter and you should reassure him you\u2019re still friends and that you and this girl are just friends, but also know this is normal high school shit. But also if he continues to be shitty about it don\u2019t be afraid to actually set him straight. \n\nYou\u2019re not the AH.  Jason is just hurt and insecure, but also if he continues like this don\u2019t be afraid of telling him off. You and Alice are just friends and you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel bad about it.", "NTA. You're all still babies so I'll tell you this.  Be cautious when it comes to male rage. I know you yourself are one, but jealously is ugly and if Jason allows it to control his emotions, especially at this age, he may do something he will regret.", "Thank you, I think i\u2019ll take your advice with the trusted friend situation because Jason likes to make big deals out of things. Thank you for the advice.", "Manipulation didn\u2019t even cross my mind, woah \ud83d\ude1f", "The problem I see with this is that Jason and all of them are just teenagers going through their first loves. I don\u2019t really think his friend is controlling or anything. He is just too young and just feels insecure. He is most likely still in love with her and feels betrayed that his friend isn\u2019t on his side and still hangouts with Alicia. He probably feels like they are talking about him and that he sides with Alicia. \nJason has huge insecurity and confidence issues", "Thank you. I was worried about this happening when Alicia and Jason first started flirting but I reassured myself because Jason has always been called the \u201cfiner\u201d friend growing up, it wasn\u2019t until January that I started getting physical compliments.\n\nJason also told me that this wasn\u2019t going to be a problem but that was obviously a lie.\ud83d\ude2c", "Jason sounds very insecure.", "Thank you for the advice.", "I lost someone I considered my best friend for a similar reason. She knew my opinion on platonic relationships, cheaters, and commitment. We had moved away from each other, so I didn't meat her boyfriend until he was her fiance. \n\nThe way she acted, you'd think I'd have stolen a man from someone before. It was jarring. What I didn't know, was she'd been showing jealous behavior already. When the fiance saw how she couldn't control her jealousy around someone she said she'd trusted for over a decade, he saw how bad things were in their relationship. He later broke up with her.\n\nIt hurt to be treated that way by someone I considered a trusted friend, but I was old enough to know it didn't have anything to do with me directly. It all came from her own insecurities. It sounds like you're in a similar spot with Jason, and I'm sorry for that. I hated it when it happened to me, and I was already into my 20's. I'm sure it's even more intense at your age. \n\nGiven my own experience, I hope you can trust me when I say to keep Alicia in your life. It sounds like Jason kept her from her friends, and that's how abusive relationships start. She needs to reconnect with those friends, and find some much needed support. Knowing you're still there as a friend likely means a lot to her.\n\nSide note: I hope this makes sense, as it past 2am here. I'll check it in the morning.", "He referred to Alicia as \"his scraps\" that's a pretty AH phrase to me. I know he's just a teenage boy but that sort of language isn't a good sign", "Info: I'm confused about what your friend group thinks. Why do the friends that think you're in the wrong think you're in the wrong? This all seems so innocuous that I don't understand the conflict.", "NTA. Jason is a crybaby. Your relationship with her simply isn\u2019t his business.", "NTA. Jason is a crybaby. Your relationship with her simply isn\u2019t his business.", "NTA. Jason is a crybaby. Your relationship with her simply isn\u2019t his business.", "NTA", "I hope things resolve with your friend."]}
