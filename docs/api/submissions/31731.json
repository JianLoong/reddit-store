Within the past 7 months, we\u2019ve welcomed a beautiful baby girl to our family. She\u2019s the love of our lives and we couldn\u2019t be happier to have her. But my husband and I are facing a disagreement when it comes to his habits of marijuana consumption. (We live in a state where it is legal recreationally.)\n\nFor context, my husband started smoking when he was 12. He became a habitual marijuana smoker. He\u2019s the type of smoker who wakes up and immediately has to get high and then hits his bowl every hour until he falls asleep. He\u2019s spent the majority of his life high. He has had a lot of serious trauma in his life and lacked the proper mental health help he needed. So I understood using weed as a crutch. I knew this when we got together and I personally never had an issue with it until our daughter was born.\n\nWhen we found out I was pregnant, he assured me that he was going to make an effort to stop smoking and get the mental health help he needs. He grew up with parents that smoked weed all of the time and he always said he didn\u2019t want our daughter to play second fiddle to any kind of substance. Once she was born, he did get on medication to help his mental health and he did stop smoking completely for about 2 months. But he\u2019s recently picked it back up again. It\u2019s not nearly as bad as it was before, but it\u2019s still a weekly (if not every other day) occurrence. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where he has lied to me about purchasing marijuana and has gone behind my back and smoked it once I fell asleep. He says he should be able to pick it up and put it down whenever he pleases. I told him I was okay with him smoking it during the weekend with friends if he wanted to, but it\u2019s turning into more than that now. So now because of his behavior towards it, I personally believe that he should stop altogether because I believe that he has a very serious dependency on it and I don\u2019t want our daughter to see it growing up. \n\nSo, AITA for wanting him to stop smoking weed?", "created_utc": 1700945690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/183ta3g/aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_stop_smoking_weed/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Changing a habit like this requires a lot of support, and hard boundaries can help, but as you've seen can also lead to deception.\n\nYou might want to look into the writing of Nic Sheff. He was addicted to meth, so a different drug, but he and his father dealt with this situation of using a drug as an emotional crutch and lying about it. His advice was that hard boundaries are incredibly important.", "I stopped smoking weed when I had my son, but I was getting paranoid with it before that so so it was just a easy choice.\n\nUltimately he needs to stop because he wants to not because its forced as its likely to cause arguments and he will likely have some resentment and it will effect his state of mind.\n\n\nI would look at cbd see if of that helps.\n\n\nI still dable now and again but more a social think at a party.", "I relate to your husband a lot ( have had Trauma, weed has been a daily part of my life since i was young, and I acknowledge that I\u2019m using weed instead of getting proper mental help).

For me, the hiding and smoking came from feeling my partner at the time didn\u2019t understand my emotional connection to smoking. What I needed was help easing out, what I got was hard lines and judgment. Which pushed me to smoke more. (There were no children involved however). \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is sounds like your husband \u201csucceeded\u201d with cold turkey but is struggling with addressing the actual subconscious bond. \nIt takes time and understanding to shift that. Maybe next time you think your SO is going to smoke after you fall asleep, offer to go out with him. Talk to him. Talk about why smoking helps him sleep. Start with maybe only smoking at night and easing off from there.

I also live in an area where it is legal and here is what worked for me.  I switched from smoking J's to lower THC edibles (small amounts of oil at a time or 2.5mg gummies were my go to). This essentially \"took the edge off\" but still allowed me to be more present. Eventually, by getting used to the mellower high lower THC edibles gives, I found I have less of a need for it in general and can now go weeks at a time without it.

I would leave it be because it could push him to using other things.", "You\u2019re NTA for wanting to quit to better himself for his own benefit and his family. IMO, it\u2019s very irresponsible as a parent. I smoked daily for about 6 years and have recently gone cold turkey. \n\nI did have deliberate t-breaks throughout and did a lot of deep thinking about my use. Apart from the odd social situation or on certain occasions (and even then it\u2019s not necessarily optimal), there really isn\u2019t much benefit and it\u2019s a horrendous addiction. \n\nA way to simply sedate yourself and check out from reality. My tolerance was super high and like most people who smoked daily, because of this reason, you try to act like it\u2019s all good and you\u2019re present and with it - the truth is that you aren\u2019t. \n\nYour focus is on when you will smoke next and you get irritated at things getting in the way. I\u2019m an intelligent person who needs to be stimulated. I realised that when I had nothing meaningful or challenging to do, it was the easy route to switch my brain off, making monging out on PlayStation for 5+ hours a day seem okay. \n\nI cannot do anything meaningful whilst high - I can try but I know I don\u2019t get the full benefit as I\u2019m not able to be fully present or assimilate the knowledge. I quit daily use because I knew it was better for me and I knew my girlfriend also wanted that, and I didn\u2019t wanna be a shitty partner. \n\nRather than saying I\u2019ll never use it again, I just set boundaries i.e., no more coming home from work and going straight for it until bedtime. I\u2019ll just use it on social occasion with friends or on specific dates throughout the year (celebrations). \n\nI don\u2019t wanna say you\u2019re an asshole, I think perhaps a bit ignorant. It was irresponsible to bring a child into the world with a father in this state. And perhaps you are a bit naive with his habits.

If he genuinely needs weed for medical purposes can he take it in edible form instead of smoking? To minimize exposure to the child. Set firm times and locations where it is ok vrs not ok for him to take it. EG; not inside the house. Only after the child is asleep. \n\nLong term he should look at treatment for drug addiction and therapy for trauma. Be mindful that this can result in very irrational and at time aggressive behavior and he may need to spend some time away from the child.\n\nYou need to be very firm and if he can't stick to this then you need to leave and prioritize your child. The reality is he is unlikely to change but your a mum now and if his behavior puts your child at risk you need to leave and put their safety first.", "NTA - Given that he picked up his habit from his parents it's not hard to see why your daughter would be more inclined to do the same with a smoker in the house. I understand that you were okay with it in the beginning but having a child is serious business. It's okay to reflect and say \"maybe I shouldn't have been so okay with it\". He acknowledges that it's not a healthy habit and his compulsive nature would suggest that he's an addict. I would know, I spent 12 years smoking weed and would make every excuse under the sun to keep smoking and avoiding my problems. I've been clean for almost a year and my mental health has improved immeasurably, turns out that abusing substances does nothing but prolong your recovery from whatever trauma and/or issues you might be running from. There has to come a time where you admit that you're either using substances or you're not, as an addict you can't sit in the middle and have it both ways. Weekend smoking, social smoking etc all need to be stopped if you want to get a grip of your life. Again, definitely NTA, that's not to say that he is but it's definitely time for him to grow up and deal with is mental health.", "ESH he wasn't ready to commit to you and a child.

Weed helps anxiety, depression, eating disorders and also the oils can be used for muscle cream or even seizure medications. This is a natural grown substance from the earth itself. The medical grown plants have chemicals and man made chemicals in it which is more harmful, it increases anxiety and can induce panic. Some strains actually induce panic naturally also and some people can not smoke due to the panic attacks it can cause. If he wants to smoke, he can. If he is doing it away and outside from your child then there is no problem. If you don\u2019t want your child growing up with it, I suggest moving to a non legal state. I\u2019ve smoked since I was 15 every day, all day until I got pregnant, then after I stopped breast feeding, and the. Now she is a year old I\u2019m smoking outside or at my friends. I keep nothing I\u2019m my home and my anxiety is 10x better, I\u2019m also on anxiety meds, and my depression. I\u2019m eating more since I wasn\u2019t eating due to stress and I dropped massive amounts at one time after pregnancy. I\u2019m healthy again, and it is not affecting my child in anyway because I\u2019m a responsible adult who can responsibly enjoy a nice smoke and treat it as a nice drink. I can start and stop anytime I want to. It\u2019s not addicting. I don\u2019t have to do it, I want to. I\u2019m not bothering nobody, nobody is bothering me. My child is fed, clothed, bathed, and up to date on all medical care life is good. Just a little stressy and depressy but that\u2019s because of my own self being severely adhd and chronic anxiety disorder.", "What exactly is the problem? Its not like he's drunk. Is he being a bad parent? Why does it matter if he smokes or not? As long as the child is not being exposed what's the problem? Would you stop grandma from baby sitting because she likes a cup of tea in the morning?", "NTA. I used to be addicted to cannabis, I understand what your husband is dealing with. I\u2019ve also dealt with loved ones who are addicts, so I understand what you\u2019re going through. It\u2019s tough to quit, but the lying and going behind your back is seriously unacceptable behavior. Unfortunately with addicts, it\u2019s likely not going to stop until he faces some kind of serious negative repercussions. Most addicts don\u2019t quit until they hit what we call \u201crock-bottom\u201d. That\u2019s different for everyone, and it seems like your husband hasn\u2019t gotten there yet. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d set a very hard boundary with him if I were you. If you catch him smoking again, say you\u2019ll kick him out of the house until he gets X amount of days sober (I\u2019d recommend 2-4 weeks). That will make it real for him, knowing he could actually lose his child over this. Then if he does end up smoking again, you\u2019ll need to follow through and be willing to accept what that means if he ultimately refuses to stay sober. But letting him continue to get away with it only enables the behavior, because he knows he can do it with no immediate consequences. \n\nSo you have a decision to make\u2026how important is this to you? If having him smoking is something you can learn to live with, maybe don\u2019t go that route. But if this is something you are serious about, you\u2019ll need to set a hard boundary with clear consequences and enforce those consequences as promised if he doesn\u2019t follow through. That\u2019s likely the only way he\u2019ll follow through with quitting permanently.", "ESH. Him for prioritizing weed over child.

Your original rule is fair and you should stick to it because trying to enforce quitting something forever doesn't initially work, I've tried that for myself. Cutting back to once a week and working on sticking to that works. This is something that requires some patience. Do what I did when I was trying to do break my own dependency, have him store his stuff at a friend's house, so that he's forced to follow through. It's there when the time comes and he can smoke without feeling ashamed of himself, something that inflates the problem. Hope this helps.", "YTA\u2026 i get your viewpoint but he\u2019s been a heavy smoker since you met him\u2026 it was your choice to have a baby and have him as the father, you could have discussed thoroughly what would happen when you had kids and somehow you forgot to think about it?", "You\u2019re NTA, but wouldn\u2019t you rather have an emotionally stable and available partner who got high every other day because he enjoyed it than someone who quit and is miserable because \u201chis wife told him to\u201d? I mean, coming at this from the perspective of not wanting to perpetuate generational trauma with your own child, in a perfect world the best thing would be for him to go to counseling alone, you to go to counseling alone, and then both of you to go to counseling together. I understand this is an involved process but you both need to decide if it\u2019s ultimately worth it. It\u2019s not your place to *demand* he stop smoking, but you deserve to have the kind of partner who understands how his drug use is affecting your relationship, and could affect his relationship with your child now and down the road. The way you support each other is crucial to getting a handle on things. Because marijuana isn\u2019t a typical drug in terms of addiction, what you\u2019re trying to manage are addictive behaviors, and that\u2019s really hard to do without getting to the root cause of the behaviors. All I can say is for the sake of the kid, don\u2019t let this play out like an argument any longer. It\u2019s not ok to insist he quit smoking MJ, but it is very ok to insist he & you receive *effective* counseling. Good luck.", "Listen I understand where you are coming from and depending on where you live it could become a legal issue if he were ever caught. I will say this he probably lied because he knew you would be upset and for probably no other reason. Weed gets a bad rap but would you rather he be drinking like that? Alcohol is way worse for you. With a little one I quit drinking  permanently but suffer from chronic pain so I started smoking legal weed with a prescription. My little ones are now 4 and 6 so have grown I to some level of independence  and don\u2019t require around the clock attention as when they were babies. I\u2019d say neither of you ATA but rather a miscommunication. Maybe try compromising with him and see if he will quit except for weekends until the baby is (however old you feel is okay) then he can use more frequently but only when the kid is asleep or visiting relatives. That\u2019s where I am now. I don\u2019t touch it during the day even though I\u2019m retired, mainly because I have to get things done being the SAHD. Once the kids are in bed and asleep\u2026. Off to the garage I go. I get the pain relief I need to sleep and the kids get a fully functioning dad. I understand every situation is different and this might not be the best option for you but I think some sort of compromise that works for both of you will serve better then just one person saying this is the way it needs to be. Being new parents is difficult enough as it is so just give each other a break and talk about it.", "Leave him alone and don't shame him, talk to him empethetically about his use and let him quit for his own reasons or have a balanced moderate use. Judging him and making him feel guilty will not help at all and may actually make it harder for him to understand for himself how he wants to use or not use the substance. I assume he is in therapy, encourage him to talk to his therapist about his current use and history. I smoked daily for 8 years and had my struggles with understanding my use and how it benefited and hurt me but eventually found the right time and reasons to stop. My partner never put pressure on me to quit or made me feel ashamed about using. Don't judge what moderation looks like or feels like to him.", "ESH. You *knew* that he smoked when you met him. If you wanted him to quit when you had kids, that should have been a conversation before you became serious, or you shouldn't have married him. \n\nHowever.\n\nHe said he wanted to quit for the baby, and he needs to do whatever he needs to do in order to stick with that. He doesn't sound like the kind of person who can just be a weekend with the guys smoker, and he needs to realize that and take quitting seriously. IF he's serious about quitting. If he's not, then he needs to say so, and you both need to figure out what to do from there.", "NTA. A kid changes everything. That\u2019s a lot of people\u2019s sign to grow up.

Cocaine and mushrooms come from \u201cthe earth itself\u201d too. This response is filled with projection. A parent who is high all the time os not their ideal self. You\u2019re talking about someone who is addicted to a substance here and it\u2019s affecting their partner in a negative way. This is a real situation and it\u2019s unfair to brush it aside because you yourself like get high all the time. OP and husband need to see a counselor and have some long discussions about what the future is going to look like for them. And this is coming from someone who smoked for a large part of their life. Weed is most definitely psychologically addictive and I\u2019ve never seen anyone who says they can \u201cstop anytime\u201d actually stop. Most people who stop, stop for good because they realize they\u2019re addicted. Everyone else just keeps on smoking, even if they take a break for a month or two, they come back to it just like a OPs husband, unless they decide to quit for good.", "As someone with a nursing degree, I completely understand the medical significance that marijuana has for those in need of it. Maybe the reason I am having such a problem with it is because I was born and raised in a state where it was not legal. Thank you for your insight!", "Lol as a lifelong smoker, you comparing it to tea has got to be the dumbest fucking thing I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s a drug, it changes your state of mind -  you are not sober when you are high so if you don\u2019t understand the problem, then I suggest you educate yourself on the subject before it comes up and bites you or someone you love in the ass. Being high 24 seven is not an ideal situation and again this is coming from someone who loves weed, but recognizes it for what it is.", "Terrible advice. Don\u2019t listen to this person. OP. Threatening to kick someone out of the house. If they don\u2019t quit an addictive habit is about as dumb as it gets. I\u2019m sorry that you have a husband who is addicted to weed, but you knew this going into the relationship. If he wants to quit, you need to help him get the proper treatment but a threat is pretty much the worst thing you could do in this situation.", "This is the correct answer", "Junkie is a little harsh.", "https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/the-truth-about-exercise-addiction/202207/how-mens-cannabis-use-can-affect-their-childrens", "Can I ask what makes you feel that way? (I\u2019m not disagreeing at all, I\u2019m just curious!)", "I'd ask him if he really meant what he said about quitting way back when, and that you really were impressed with his commitment at the start. Have an open and honest, non-hostile conversation about how he wants to move forward with his relationship with cannabis, then tell him how you feel about that. Ask him if he wants you to do anything for him if he slips on the boundaries you both agree to.\n\nAlso, kids can totally tell when you're inebriated. Also if he wants to make a serious change, it won't happen by hanging out with the friends he had when he was all day er'ry day", "Having a kid when one of the parents isnt reliable at all, is a very poor decision.", "Keep in mind, though, that at the end of the day, your husband is still an addict, and addicts are inherently bad at \"dabbling now and then\". If it was possible, he wouldn't have started again, and even moreso, he wouldn't have lied.\n\nHowever, YWBTA if you stay with him if he favors smoking weed over his daughter. Why? Because despite us always wanting to think \"it's not that bad\", your husband even said himself that he did not want this for his daughter. Take her out of the situation, before she as well will end up with the exact same issues and have the cycle continue. And taking your daughter out of the situation does not necessarily mean \"break up\" or \"dump him\", however, it does mean \"move out\" and \"make clear expectations\". Your husband needs to get himself together and get his shit together. He has medication, so he's not even supposed to be using any substances. Not to mention, considering he has lied about smoking it, you clearly cannot EVER leave your daughter alone with him unless he is FULLY off of weed.\n\nAnd no, don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-weed and I'm not saying that people who occasionally light one up cannot parent their children. I am saying that an addict who lies and mixes medicine with substances **cannot be trusted.** Your husband, right now, does not have the capacity to take care of himself, let alone a child. So you need to step up, take your daughter OUT of the situation and come up with a plan with your husband for him to steer clear of ALL substances (addicts tend to fall from one addiction into the next), get more help with his issues with substance abuse and lying through a therapist, until he can be trusted to not lie and to be a responsible parent for your daughter. That way, he can make the informed choice of either getting himself together with all the help you can offer him, or to only be with his daughter without it being supervised EVERY SECOND by a responsible adult until such time he feels he is ready to get himself together.\n\nYour a mom now, your number one priority **needs** to be your child and what you are willing to expose your child to. And better your husband get his shit together in her early years, then him eventually getting worse and scarring her for the rest of her life.", "Why talk about it being taken socially.  The stuff stinks and its not social for anyone nearby to have to put up with it and the horrific smell. You got involved with an addict but I guess you're someone who thought they could change their partner.", "Unlike all those eloquent drinkers out there.", "I don\u2019t mean to cause offence. It\u2019s not prescribed in my country for very good reason. You should work through trauma and become more resilient; it\u2019s preferable to sedating yourself temporarily. \n\nThings swept under the rug will only come back to harm you significantly more than if you dealt with it in good time. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about how it\u2019s prescribed dosage wise and frequency - I sure hope OP\u2019s husband\u2019s usage isn\u2019t considered a medical prescription\u2026 that level will cause more harm than good - it\u2019s indisputable.", "Yes ma\u2019am I have a lot of childhood trauma also and live in NC. It is not legal medically but is passing through votes.m(yet) and not in the works for recreational at all. (Yet). My adoptive mother od when I was 16, I seen her kill herself everyday, went with her on runs and houses. Found out I was adopted when I was 20 and confronted my dad, found out I have siblings, my mother gave birth to me withdrawing cause she was on drugs and my dad is Italian and left the country, I was illegally adopted and her parental rights were terminated in 2009, my social security card has changed and dss to this day won\u2019t change it unless we sit down with ss and dss and the state with all my records because if you look me up I have two birth dates, two or 3 names, a bunch of court cases, I confronted my adopted mother lawyer, who\u2019s name was all over the paper work, and he explained in a shady way what happened. Birth mother found me after I blew up on TikTok and started going viral and traveling, immediately wanted money, was in a abusive relationship going to court in another state ,I have sooo much shit and stories I. Starting to write all I remember on here. So yes, he may need it if anything like his life is similar to mine. There\u2019s more that I\u2019m not saying. But if he is being responsible, let him chill and smoke.", "Yep, smoked for 12 years and I can safely say that smoking weed on a daily basis, even if it's away from the kids, is unhealthy. People who don't have experience with addiction are too quick to write weed off just because it's legal in some places. It messes with you mind, erodes you relationships and 100% effects your parenting skills and your child's life. Her BF was exposed to it as a child and now he's been a chronic user since the age of 12, if that's not a red flag I don't know what is!", "Have you ever dealt with addiction or helped someone else dealing with addiction? It doesn\u2019t sound like you have, or else you\u2019d know this is reasonable. Treatment helps but the person in question needs to really want it for it to work, and if OP doesn\u2019t enforce clear boundaries and consequences then there likely won\u2019t be enough reason for him to follow through. She already gave him a chance to do it without these boundaries and he failed. Continuing to let him break the boundary with no consequences is enabling behavior.", "So you feel like a child should be exposed to (and heck, possibly even be left alone with, even  if for just a quick bathroom break) an infant? No. There shouldn't even be a threat, mom should IMMEDIATELY remove daughter from the situation, or remove father from the situation, father can then make the informed choice of supervised visits with daughter, or get his shit together.\n\nFather clearly said he didn't want his daughter to grow up like he did. And coddling an addict DOES NOT WORK, no matter how much you tell yourself it worked on you.", "I really appreciate the link to the article as well as your opinion. It gives me a lot to think about. Thank you.", "Yeah I'm curious too. I have a similar dependency as your husband OP and I'm a perfectly functional member of society.. if you've been with him 3 years and were okay with his habits, and if he was always working I see no reason he would quit his job? \n\nI know that you are going to have a hard time getting him to stop and if you ban it he will go behind your back. My suggestion would be to try a better compromise. Only after the baby is asleep might be a good start, and you have time to work on it as your child grows", "They become mentally challenged too. I\u2019m not for any of it.", "Literally, you\u2019re talking to someone who beat addiction. Stop pretending you know what you\u2019re talking about.", "Please make sure you don't risk a second child at this point.  \n\nI hope for your sake I am wrong and he does sort himself out.", "As someone with a similar dependency, do you think it\u2019s possible for you to stop all together over time? Or do you believe it\u2019s something that will always be part of your life? \n\nThank you for your input though! I appreciate it greatly.", "I do know what I\u2019m talking about. You may have beat it yourself, but I\u2019ve helped dozens of other people get there too. I know what works and what doesn\u2019t. Your sample size is one, yourself.", "I think that legalisation is overall better than criminalizing weed use.\n\nHowever it does make people think it is safe and harmless.  It isn't.", "This pregnancy left me with a complication that left me unable to have anymore children so a second child is no worry. \n\nI appreciate you. Thank you.", "It would be unfair and create resentment that would bubble into every disagreement you have. You should drop it and focus on loving the man he is. \n\nYour suggestions should be welcome, but it would be unfair to set force it and only cause hassles for both of you. You'll be constantly suspicious and he will be constantly nervous when he cannot fight what is such a deep down part of his person. \n\nThe work you need to do is on accepting things as they are and how to optimise things as such. I'm not saying change isn't possible, but it would need to come naturally, from his side and without harsh judgement and policing for setbacks.", "It hard to say honestly, I'm still working at my mental health too. I am single though, no kids, but I see that as an advantage for him, so long as you don't give up on him!", "Oh I am so sorry for bringing that up.", "Yeah this really made me think, like I want to quit smoking (cigarettes) but that's a whole other process. Thing is, I don't really want to quit smoking weed. I can, and have gone weeks, months, even years without, but yeah, eventually I come back to it. \n\nSo that to say I support this guys comment!\n\nHope this helps OP and best wishes to you and your family :)"]}
