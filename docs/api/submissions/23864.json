I told him I needed to think about it, and he gave me time till the next day. after thinking for a bit, the next day I met with him and my sister at a bar. after my sister went to the bathroom I mentioned his proposal plan and how I was not going to tolerate him trying to make this magical day that was for my wife and me about him.he blew up on me. calling me all sorts of names. he told me he had told his family and had bought the ring, because he was 100% sure I would tolerate that kind of behavior on MY WEDDING. my anger issues couldn't hold back and my face turned red. I told him: \" Your're literally asking me if I want you to ruin the best day of my life? imagine if I told my sister that you wanted to marry her? it wouldn't be a surprise anymore, would it? how would that feel\"After that he went quiet and I looked around the bar, everybody was looking at our table including my sister who had heard everything. my sister and my BIL ran out of the bar and cut contact with me and my wife. they never came to my wedding, until at thanks giving when everybody in my family showed up there I saw her. She called me an asshole for not letting my BIL propose to her at my wedding it would be the best day of her life, but I apparently unnecessarily stepped in and stopped my BIL for no good reason. me and my sister both share the same friend group and everybody in the group is pretty split on my decision. some accuse me of being the asshole , but I cant see why?\r  \n\r  \nreddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1691155417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15i001r/aita_for_ruining_my_bils_proposal_plan/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But even I know that you don't do anything at someone's wedding to take the attention off of the bride and groom, especially a proposal. You didn't even ruin the proposal, your BIL did that by asking you in the first place. It's not your fault that your sister overheard the conversation.

Proposing at a wedding is something we see in alot of romance movies I can see why he thought it was a good idea. I don't think OP saying no made BIL mad it was how it was said. My mom always raised me its not always what you say but how you say it. Op came hostile when he could have just said no kindly like family is supposed to do with family. I love my BIL id tell him no not on my wedding day but if you want I'll help you come up with ideas. BIL had a not so great idea but his heart was in the right place he even made sure to get a green light before doing it which shows he wasn't trying to be a jerk. A real AH would have just did it and not cared if OP was okay with it.", "NTA. how entitled are they to think they can take your spotlight on your day??!! Weddings are insanely expensive, they are a day to celebrate one couple\u2019s love for each other.", "ESH-your sister and BIL were very misguided in this but your reaction was really crappy as well. There is almost no reason to yell at another adult especially loud enough that the whole restaurant is looking at you. Nobody handled this situation well.", "Not the AH for not wanting it at your wedding and saying no but YTA for how you told him no , I really don't think he was trying to make your magical day about him he just had a romantic idea many do, so to me saying all you did especially the tolerate part seems like he was trying to do something harmful to you guys on your wedding day and he just wasn't. You see it as he was trying to ruin the most important day and you treated him like such, that may have set me off to I hate when people try to twist my intentions into something ugly it highly offends me because I'm not that kind of person. Not saying him name calling was right but like ruining your sisters surprise was out of line she did nothing to you and he asked in advance so he also didn't ruin a important moment for you all but you ruined their engagement moment definitely unnecessary. You could have been like I just want that day about us but you attacked him pretty much with how you said no then ruined his engagement. Yeah YTA", "ESH. You should have told him no when he first asked as you obviously felt strongly about it. You waited until your sister left the room for a few minutes to start a heated conversation. It almost sounds like you wanted to spoil any proposal in retaliation for him having the audacity to ask you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
