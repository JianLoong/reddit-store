It would make me dislike the movie truthfully.", "I agree, I can\u2019t imagine being a mutual friend and siding with BIL", "I don't think both my BIL or my sister would like to see my face at their wedding since they didn't show up at our wedding and also i don't want to respond to pettiness with more pettiness yk?", "I just discovered that tying your gf's shoe for her is considered romantic in korean dramas, so I'm very willing to accept that there are things in pop culture I've never heard of but... yeah, nothing's coming to mind here.", "And what if your groom said 'no'?", "Well, yeah, it was mostly tongue in cheek :)", "More and likely who I get married to wouldn't care but if he wasn't okay with a proposal I'd respect that its not just my day.", "I never said OP should have said yes either just that he said no in a AH way. Anyone has every right to want all attention on them on their day.", "Esh\n\nYour bro obviously. But you can\u2019t excuse your behavior either. First of all, if you felt so passionately, why even take a day to say no? Second, there is no excuse to act like that in public. I don\u2019t care how ridiculous he was being.", "NTA. I don't understand how your friends are split. The only acceptable instance for proposing at someone else's wedding is with the blessing of the people being celebrated that day.", "Nta you should never propose at someone's big event whatever it is especially if it is something like a wedding or a funeral", "Everyone in your friend group that agrees with her is stupid af. Now you know who can\u2019t be trusted with sharp objects and caustic chemicals.", "NTA proposing at someone Elses wedding is a major AH move. the day is about the bride and groom and your BIL was trying to steal that thunder. Ask your sister how if at her wedding someone announced they were pregnant and got all the attention? it was your day and your wife's day and your sister seems to have forgotten that.", "NTA He didn't have a plan. He wanted to hijack all the planning for the party you did. That is like asking a leech what it wants for supper. \"Let me have a bit of your life. Who cares if you suffer a bit.\"", "NTA, it was your wedding day", "NTA\n\nIt's absolutely beyond the pale to grandstand on the bride and groom's occasion in any way. You don't wear a white dress and you don't steal the spotlight. That one person in an adult couple would not know this is questionable--that two adults would presume not to know the rule and make themselves victims is hard to comprehend. \n\nYour brother threatened to take attention from you on your wedding day and painted you into a corner so you had to put a stop to it. Your wedding day was not in any way designed to be the happiest day of your brother's girlfriend's life. No family should feel torn. You're clearly in the right here. \n\nSocial etiquette is built around not making people uncomfortable. Your brother breached this when he put you in the position to make your day about his life. You were understandably not having it, but he pressed you. He made you uncomfortable and you shut him down by any means at your disposal because you had to stick up for yourself and your partner to honor your special day. Those two need to drop it and anyone feeling concern for their overwhelming entitlement needs to consult any available etiquette manual from the past hundred-plus years.", "NTA", "They deserve each other.NTA", "proposing at your wedding is very easy for him.  zero effort involved \n\nif he could put actual work into it, he wouldn't need to involve your wedding\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's a widely known rule that one doesn't propose at someone else's wedding. Or do another announcement like pregnancy or...\n\nDepending on the bride and groom and how they handle such rules, it might be ok, if you ask them beforehand and talk about how and when. If the couple is ok, then go ahead.\n\nBut your BIL is an AH, if he already prepared everything, including informing his family, but telling you (he didn't really ask...) just 2 days before the wedding. And then for not taking a No for an answer but blowing up and everything. He ruined everything, his proposal and also your wedding, all by himself. And so is everybody who sides with him.", "NTA \\_ FFS what kind of self absorbed narcissist hijacks someone else's wedding day for their big event? If he hadn\u2019t tried to pull that stunt his own plans would not have been derailed - can\u2019t they see cause and effect?", "NTA.  Not in the slightest.", "NTA\n\nYour only mistake was risking her overhearing. Their overreacting is on them.", "NTA people who.propose at other people's weddings are to lazy to come up with their own romantic environment", "Not the a hole ! He can propose anywhere why did it have to be at your wedding  that's you and your wife's special day not your sisters and bil !!", "NTA\u2026 it\u2019s literally YOUR wedding. imagine if the roles were switched and you wanted to propose at their wedding\u2026 i guarantee their answer would be NO. if i were you and your partner, i\u2019d announce a pregnancy at their wedding \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nIt should be common sense by now that on a day and at an event that is meant to celebrate a specific person or couple, you don't try to steal their thunder.", "NTA. \n\nThis is akin to a woman wearing white at another's wedding, etc. \n\nAND EVEN if OP and wife were ok with it... which they weren't, it was incredibly rude to assume he would say yes and notify everyone. This is all sort of tacky.", "NTA, why not have waited for Thanksgiving when the family was together on a mutually happy day generally, out at least a day that usually goes the same way every year with the same idle chatter and general family suffering. Would have livened up the day for sure.", "Yes. He doesn\u2019t get to make your wedding about them just because he\u2019s cheap. I would\u2019ve told him he could only if he paid for the entirety of the reception, since he was stealing yours.", "I thought BIL was just being stingy but definitely he's lazy wanting to hijack someone else's hard work for his own benefit.", "When I had my wedding, my now husband had a close friend that had proposed to his gf on their anniversary, which was a month before our wedding. \n\n\nDespite my protesting that it was OK and expected, she didn't wear her ring that night because \"your wedding is about you, and I'll expect everyone to make a fuss over me and my ring next month at the engagement party\"\n\n\nOP NTA, but you certainly need better friends.", "He already said \u201cno\u201d politely but BIL decided to be an asshole.\n\nNot OP\u2019s fault that BIL has issues.", "Agreed. I get not answering right away so that OP could mull over the best way to say \"no.\" Had OP simply called BIL or got together alone with him a day or two later to tell him politely it wasn't going to happen and THEN BIL started arguing, I'd be completely on OP's side. However, he not only did this drinking at a bar where his sister was present, OP escalated the situation with his \"anger issues.\" BIL and sister certainly overreacted and need to get over themselves at this point but OP isn't exactly a victim here.", "NTA - ask your sister if BIL always halfasses his shows of affection for her- cause that must be why she\u2019s okay with her proposal, the supposed \u2018best day of her life\u2019 being /someone else\u2019s event./", "Nta", "Tbh I see nothing wrong with him proposing but that\u2019s just my opinion. Either way, NTA it\u2019s your guys day", "NTA.   I hate when people don't have enough imagination to create their own special events and want to hijack someone else's.  He should have taken the time to plan something for himself.  And after they have been together this long, why did it have to be at YOUR wedding?  That is just lazy and inconsiderate.  I would be just too embarrassed if my hubby had done that.  I would have said no just on principle.", "NTA.  He should have thrown his own party and not tried to hijack yours.  I genuinely don't know why people think this is ok.", "NTA....    At your wedding...  100% a hijack of your day....  its just a lazy cant be arsed investing any time or effort way of ...proposing,", "NTA\n\nIt's so cheap to ride  the coattails of another couple's party  to try  and make that party about you. Like sadly cheap. And weird. Why  would anyone want that? Why  wouldn't  they want their own special moment? Ughh", "and now what you have to do is announce your wife's \"pregnancy\" at your sister's wedding", "NTA - there are only a few unsaid but known rules for a wedding; rsvp on time, don't wear a white dress and don't make the day about you  (proposing, announcements)  your bil is the AH", "As a normal person would be! \n\nThe sister saying it would have been the best day of her life?!

It's well known that you don't pull shit like this in civilized society. He's too lazy to plan a proposal so thinks doing it at your wedding and taking the spotlight away from you is the way to go. Absolutely not.", "NTA. It was your wedding. Why should your wedding be the happiest day of their lives?", "NTA.", "NTA That they didn't come to your wedding was just a side bonus. \n\nAll the people who say you're the asshole are the actual assholes.

But that means he should also respect your response, whether it's yes or no. He's acting like it was supposed to be his day, and you ruined it, when it was actually the opposite. Personally, I would never ask to do such a thing, but there might be some relationships where it could be OK. However, he's displaying a sense of entitlement here. It's not your fault he jumped the gun and told his whole family before getting your answer.", "NTA. Proposing at weddings is extremely inappropriate. He probably wanted to do it at your wedding so he wouldn\u2019t have to plan anything or pay for anything himself", "NTA, since your sister thinks this was a great idea, I would announce a pregnancy at her wedding.  I'm pretty sure she wouldn't be okay with that.", "NTA. He\u2019s just being lazy and wants the stuff to be made for him. Totally in the wrong. He wouldn\u2019t like if it was Vice versa", "OP, asking if he could propose to his gf   on your wedding day is not ok. Hijacking your special day smacks of jealousy and not wanting to be outshone by you. He wants to propose? Fine but he does it elsewhere and on another day.", "Weird how your sister thinks that her bf highjacking your wedding day for a tacky, lazy, and uninspired proposal would have been the best day of her life and not, idk, her actual wedding day.  Or did she mean it would have been the best day of her life *so far*?  I'm actually kind of blown away she was mad at you over this and not her boyfriend in the first place.  I don't know anyone that would be happy with a proposal at someone's wedding, it's a pretty well known faux pas.  Has your sister always been this selfish and entitled or is this a one off thing?", "NTA. BTW If they have a three year old child I\u2019m guessing that a proposal and marriage wasn\u2019t tops on BIL\u2019s bucket list until he had a chance to highjack his sister\u2019s wedding to make himself the center of attention."]}
