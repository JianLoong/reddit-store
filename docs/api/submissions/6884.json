It doesn\u2019t even mean he didn\u2019t love their mom. If he doesn\u2019t remarry, that\u2019s none of their business, & given the nature of many relationships between adult kids & their parent\u2019s spouses, they should probably be glad about that. \n\nIf the adult kids have a quarrel with their dad that involves the children\u2019s mother, they should keep it away from the kids. They should try to remember what it was like to be a little kid whose mom died & not make things worse for the kids. If you think you need to be involved in this, then you should be on your brother\u2019s side.

You could still be helpful by actually talking to him about his feelings and helping him come up with a way to talk to his older kids about this that feels honest but isn't tactless.  That could be hard as feelings are complicated and this could involve some feelings he can't really admit like maybe feeling abandoned by his first wife.  He doesn't need to share those feelings with his kids, but he needs to come up with a narrative that isn't hurtful and also sets up his boundaries. EG: I was married to two wonderful women.

It's not comparable.\n\nBut let's use your example, even after a woman's first child dies, will she tell her partner or her other children that they are the most important and she doesn't miss her child that died( since she got a new one).
