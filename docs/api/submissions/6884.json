Who can win a fight like that? The adult kids should realize they have no say in their dad\u2019s romantic life, and if he loved his second wife more than their mom, that\u2019s no reflection on them. It doesn\u2019t even mean he didn\u2019t love their mom. If he doesn\u2019t remarry, that\u2019s none of their business, & given the nature of many relationships between adult kids & their parent\u2019s spouses, they should probably be glad about that. \n\nIf the adult kids have a quarrel with their dad that involves the children\u2019s mother, they should keep it away from the kids. They should try to remember what it was like to be a little kid whose mom died & not make things worse for the kids. If you think you need to be involved in this, then you should be on your brother\u2019s side.

It was a terrible and hurtful comparison. Words have consequences, OP.", "After he confided in you, you presented the truth. He cannot handle this truth. He can't seem to handle what is wrong and blames you and his child. What a selfish idiot.", "That's exactly it. How we use words has an impact and this is one of those times where how you say things matter.", "That's my thing. He announced it to the whole family pretty much, including the children from his first wife, the one who he wanted to remarry fast after losing. It's going to hurt feelings.", "That is not comparable and I'm jealous you didn't have to grow up with parents who had a favourite child.", "They were mad at the first kids for being upset/mad at dad for saying the second wife (second set of kids' mom) was the important wife.

Brother is a hypocrite just like father was a hypocrite. That comparison is rather fair.", "Yes, exactly. He can have his emotions and thoughts, he\u2019s not an AH for that, he\u2019s an AH because he handled the situation very poor, and unnecessarily hurt others feelings.", "Ok thank you for clarifying. NTA", "You compared him to your father who had a favourite child. This is NOT comparable to your brother having a soulmate who died. Your story doesn't indicate whether the first set of kids liked their step mom or not.", "ESH means that both sides suck.

She was no second mom in their eyes. I compared how words are used. Talking about how the second wife was irreplaceable to the kids from the first wife is not going to be taken the best by said kids. At least it's 50-50 on how they'll feel and you have to understand that.", "Of course it's a bit hurtful to hear, but it's still nowhere close to your words comparing him to your father who showed clear favouritism. I guess ESH would be a better judgment here.", "I mean, clearly it was just as hurtful when the older kids have stopped talking to him. I do want to be clear. I was not hurt by what he said. Two of kids were. He then came to me venting about his confusion that the kids were so angry. He could not understand why they felt the way they did.", "I disagree, the point op is trying to make is that words can be hurtful and that he should be more careful when talking about it. She's not comparing favoritism amongst siblings to the death of a spouse, she's just pointing out that he was hurt once by his father's words and now his kids are being hurt by his.\n\nIf he liked wife 2 better fine, nothing will change that but he doesn't have to share that with the kids. Plus I would not be surprised if in the minds of the older ones they thought that meant he preferred their siblings as well since he loved their mom more.", "I think some of that could be there. He was frustrated with the older ones over the years for not loving his second wife and not embracing her as their second mom. He believed that would be the outcome. It was not. A few times he'd tell me and our brother about it and how he couldn't understand them.", "If he was pressuring them to a make wife 2 their mother figure I think that might play a part on the rift in the relationship, if he disregarded their feelings and mourning their mother and immediately expected this woman to be a \"replacement\" and play happy family the problem might be worse than poorly choose words. Does he resent them for not playing along in his fantasy? Because if so yeah those kids definitely feel unloved, and as consequence will cling on to the memories of their mother because in their eyes that was the only person who truly loved them", "I don't know if he resented them but was definitely frustrated that they didn't move along nice and easy like he did.", "Please talk to his older kids, you don't have to get involved in the mess and pick sides but maybe it'd be good for them to feel like someone cares about their feelings because their dad unfortunately doesn't or is unable to atm", "NTA.\n\nCan your brother second wife have meant more to him than the first?

Absolutely no.\n\nYou did nice, OP.", "NTA.\n\nJust as a heads up for anyone who might not know -- the speech/action dichotomy is **fictional.** There aren't \"actions\" and \"speech\" and never the twain shall meet.

There is a *distinction* between saying something and doing the thing you're speaking about -- but both are actions.\n\nYour brother said what he said out loud to the world and the people there took it to heart and are reacting to it.

Which led to many occasions with the parent with whom I was the favorite as a 5yo to be surprised at my kindness, goodness or just being fun as an adult.  The hating parent had so jaded them they no longer saw me as I am but through the hating parents eyes.  I ended up going very low contact with them both 20 yrs ago.

We did not start arguing with her or telling how she should feel and what she had done wrong. We certainly did not call her a AH.\n\nWhen women suffer during pregnancy, with hormonal changes should we have a go at them for any comments that are of order?\n\nYet in this case, this man has lost two women who he loved deeply and posters  seems to think that this pain is not even a consideration", "\" his first kids about his lie (loving her so much). \"\n\nBut i don't think it was a lie. Things can change feeling don't stay the same. You can love two people equally but a 10 year marriage is not the same as a 5 or 15/20 year marriage.

It isn't one.  \nHe thinks his kids, who were 7 and 8 at the time, should get over it when he made them feel like he easily replaced their mother. It isn't that it's not a consideration, it's that he made his children feel hurt and lied to.\n If were speculating, I'd guess he knew second wife before first died, but that is neither here nor there. Brother said hurtful things, now has to deal with his consequences. \nSister is clearly NTA since she explained in a way she thought he could understand. \nSucks that the brother lost 2 wives, but he is going to lose his first kids too if he doesn't mend this.

But you can't expect it not to come up when you tell your young children that you remarrying is a good thing and shows love for their mom and doesn't give them time to accept things before taking that step.

Even if they're adults they are still entitled to have complicated feelings and hard feelings about their dad's actions and words. Ultimately, the man wanted to vent to me, and I let him, but then was confused by the new no contact with him and the older kids, and he didn't like it, and was trying to figure out why, I told him, which he also didn't like how I said it.

Are you saying that a woman who has a baby soon after the death of a child, didnt really feel anything for the first child?\n\nb) So what you are saying is going through two deaths of a partner holds no merit and people should be held accountable what they say and how they act without any allowances?\n\nSorry I dont believe this would be true if circumstances were different.", "I saw! His older kids actually didn't care much for his second wife. So no grieving there. But both sets are now grieving moms and it has become such a mess, and really no easy way to reconcile any of this.", "Second wife died over a year ago, and while he has my sympathy from multiple losses, the brother asked for advice from OP. I think OP was just trying to explain it in an easy to understand way (comparing his feelings from their Dad to his first kids with him). Also it isn't sisters job, and it comes off as condescending when people says \"so and so didn't mean that\". If they didn't mean it, it should come from them.He is hurting, but so are all the kids. First wife and seconds. He is making a bad situation worse. He should apologize to first kids for making them feel that way and assuring seconds that they shouldn't be involved with his disagreement. They all should get love and support, but it seems he dropped the ball on handling it his kids with first wife's death."]}
