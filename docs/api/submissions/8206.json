No, pregnancy is not an excuse to be abusive, but you were emotional, not abusive.

You loudly told her off, yes, but she ate your food (apparently 5 slices?) that she did not have rights to eat in the first place. \n\nShe should not have eaten your food and when she was told she made a mistake she should have rectified it by ordering you a new one (what was her plan for dinner if you didn't bring the pizza home anyway? to just freeload your food while you're gracious enough to let her stay in your home in her time of need?) In the future, maybe a sit down conversation to set clear boundaries around food (and anything else applicable) would be in order for you, your husband and sil.

So for all of the shit females get for being \u201chormonal\u201d when they\u2019ve got pms, somehow we like to erase it for pregnancy because we\u2019re sick of hearing it being used as a reason. It\u2019s a legit reason, but obviously there are limitations with it. Pregnancy fucks your body over with hormones and chemicals and a tiny human taking nutrients from you so that they can grow healthy. Your placenta can give you diabetes.

I will replace it before they\u2019re home and tell them that I ate it but replaced it. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have yelled, but we all have outbursts and moments where we aren\u2019t going to respond calmly.

I am normally a very logical person, but while pregnant, even though I knew I was being irrational, I was a slave to hormones (like needing to scrub the baseboards even though the \u201cnormal me\u201d would\u2019ve thought that was stupid).

And when I craved something, I would fixate on it (hence the obsession). I could eat something else, but if I didn\u2019t eat exactly what the craving was it wouldn\u2019t go away. Now that being said, I had HG (hyperemesis) while pregnant, and I found that most times the only time I didn\u2019t get sick was when I ate what I was craving.

This is AITA, where we all must bow down and bend over backwards to cater to the fragile pregnant women of the world who have clearly reverted to early childhood and are unable to control themselves anymore.", "YTA there is literally no reason to scream.", "Istg the exact same story without the pregnant part just with \" I was Really looking forward to it and had been looking up to this all day\" would have at LEAST gotten half the Y-T-A changed to ESH. \n\nPeople on this sub hate pregnant women it's wild.", "It wasn\u2019t right that she ate your food but being pregnant doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to yell at her the way you did either. I\u2019m pregnant and I wouldn\u2019t yell at anyone for eating my food. But I\u2019m also not confrontational like that. I would have just had my husband get me more when I found out that his sister ate it. If you\u2019re trying to save it then maybe next time put it in a container to save it. She probably thought the pizza was for everyone. Also if I was yelled at i would also refuse to replace it too.", "A little bit TA. \n\nNTA For two reasons:\n\n1. You're pregnant and your hormones are all over the place; you cannot help this. I think they need to be more understanding in this aspect; however, now that you know, maybe take a few minutes, then see if you feel the same rather than the heat of the moment.\n2. Your SIL is a guest, but when asked, it takes very little energy to dial up Papa John's, even if she was tired from work. It was an honest mistake, but she compounded it by minimizing your feelings.\n\nTA for this reason: in this accounting, did you at any point label the box as your's/do not touch? If not, they wouldn't have known, and might have thought you bought dinner AKA it was for everyone. Going forward, if you crave something, label it Do Not Touch, and this won't happen again.\n\nAgain, a little bit TA, a little bit NTA.", "INFO: You\u2019re living together, so is usually all food bought together?

Stop acting like a child, you're supposed to be a parent", "ESH but I'm leaning more towards YTA. Your SIL shouldn't have eaten food that wasn't hers, but at the same time she's also not a mind reader. For all she knew, it was to share with the household. You never told anyone that it was your pizza and you had intentions of eating it later.", "ESH. No one should have eaten your pizza, let alone 4 or 5 slices since you said you only had 3. You also shouldn't be screaming at anyone about basically anything, because outside of someone's life being at risk it isn't appropriate, healthy, or effective in resolving an issue. Even when I had been in labor for 26 hours for the birth of my son, I didn't yell at a soul, so I don't think hormones excuse the behavior. So you suck for how you handle the situation, and they suck for creating it in the first place.", "I say ESH. \nAs a formerly pregnant person I know how crazy them hormones can get with cravings. TBH, I would have cried if someone ate the remainder of my food at 25 weeks preggers however, I wouldn\u2019t have screamed/yelled at the perpetrator. Again, hormones are cray and you can take things from a 3 to a roof smashing 20 in a split second. So I think OP should be apologizing for screaming, definitely.\n\nSIL sucks because she knew this was OPs food. The very least she should do would be to ask OPs hubs if she could have some. Common sense would be to order your own pizza if you were that hungry.\n\nOPs hubs sucks because he should have told his sister that Hawaiian Pizza is OPs pregnancy craving and she would be eating the rest later and that sis should order her own\u2026 or make her a sandwich or something. \n\nJust my two cents.", "This seems so odd to me.

I honestly think it\u2019s ridiculous how many people think it\u2019s okay to eat other people\u2019s food when they didn\u2019t buy it, and didn\u2019t even ask. And THEN, upon realizing the person is upset, won\u2019t even make up for it. NTA.", "People that would never go into a family member\u2019s leftover takeout carton and take half a sandwich or a chunk of meatloaf will still take someone else\u2019s leftover pizza, because they think the rules are different for pizza and that leftover pizza is fair game.\n\nAnd as the family member that always orders pizza, it\u2019s infuriating. I\u2019ll just say there\u2019s a reason I have a private fridge in my bedroom.", "NtA\n\nSiL is the asshole cause what kind of grown ass adult helps themselves to other people's stuff without asking and then refuses to replace when you're upset?\n\nMy sil is literally just like this and I can't fucking stand her.", "No one should be eating a pregnant woman's food. Especially the food she's been craving and ordered for herself. End of story.", " NTA- people who eat other people\u2019s food deserve to be yelled at once in a while.", "NTA. Your SIL is the AH. Don't eat people's food and expect them to be calm about, especially a pregnant woman. Also, she is a repeat offender so clearly doesn't care. Additionally, why didn't she have the decency to replace it. She absolutely deserved being screamed at.", "why would the SIL need to eat 5 pieces of pizza plus all the breadsticks\u2026that\u2019s a ton of food NTA", "NTA The annoying thing here is that your husband and  SIL will gaslight you into believing you\u2019re being ridiculous and ott for such a trivial and petty thing. Regardless of whether you are pregnant or not, taking and eating something that you didn\u2019t pay for and that the other person wants is unbelievably rude and disrespectful.", "nta.  She's done this before and obviously talking to her about it has not worked.  She needs to keep your paws off your food or get out.", "Everyone here\u2019s like \u201cshe\u2019s shitty but you need to GROW UP\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m sorry? I think the person that needs to grow up is the one who can\u2019t buy her own food, eats others\u2019 food, and then doesn\u2019t even feel like they did anything wrong", "NTA who eats someone else\u2019s food without asking. Also there were 5 slices left and breadsticks and SIL ate them all. That\u2019s so rude!", "Who the fuck eats five pieces of someone else\u2019s pizza??", "NTA girl. Thats fucked up. People need to ask before eating someone else's food", "NTA. You bought pizza that was not meant to share. Someone ate it and you got mad that they ate it.", "Don\u2019t eat other people\u2019s food. She could have easily picked up her own dinner on the way home. Eat your own damn pizza", "Why do people think it's fine to eat others- *especially pregnant* people's food without asking and/or replacing what they took???\n\nMaybe you didn't need to yell, but you're still NTA", "NTA. First, if you happen to be in someone else's house you ask before taking anything. Should it happen you do this by mistake, you offer to replace it, expecially if the other person is upset and looking for it and it's something accessible like a pizza you can have delivered at your door.", "ESH.\n\nTwo things about this. Your sil was wrong for eating your food without asking and she deserves to know that you are not happy about this, however there is a better way to fix this rather than yelling at her. Yelling at someone is an aggressive and abusive behavior imo, eating someone's food without knowing you will be so upset is not an aggressive or abusive behavior. I get that your pregnancy is difficult, but yelling at someone wouldn't make a pizza magically appear in front of you. You can still get another pizza.", "NTA, do not fuck with pregnant women especially if they are hungry.", "NTA.  You do not eat food in the house you are living in that belongs to other people with out specifically asking for it.   You probably should not have screamed, unless this is a regular occurrence, but it is really frustrating to have something and someone else comes along and eats it without permission.", "Lol you just cracked me up and I scared my dog awake", "OP indicated she had done this before, even when she was not pregnant. Called her ridiculous for being mad. Since she is 25 weeks pregnant, does this mean this has been going on for more than 6 months? If so, I would scream at her too by that point,", "She says in a comment that she texted her explicitly not to eat her pizza. \n\nSIL has not contributed to bills or groceries. While yeah OP and her husband are providing food I think eating something someone (who is housing you for free and paying for all your food) asked her not to is completely an asshole thing to do.", "Bring it up daily for months? How long do you need OP to suffer lmao", "By the 3rd day they\u2019d come home to find their shit on the porch", "Even if OPs English is limited and that was the word she came up with, she made the post so it must have pretty upset her", "lol so even though you know the hormones made her act crazy, you still think it's ok?", "Like a bra?"]}
