NAH", "A lot of people here don't seem to understand that while occasionally crap like this happens and pregnant women do overreact, it's not because you want to react that way, it's the unbelievable amount of hormones that can drive women to act in ways even they find shocking. No, pregnancy is not an excuse to be abusive, but you were emotional, not abusive. Being loud and yelling is not abusive in itself, and from the sounds of it you were yelling without using abusive language. You loudly told her off, yes, but she ate your food (apparently 5 slices?) that she did not have rights to eat in the first place. \n\nShe should not have eaten your food and when she was told she made a mistake she should have rectified it by ordering you a new one (what was her plan for dinner if you didn't bring the pizza home anyway? to just freeload your food while you're gracious enough to let her stay in your home in her time of need?) In the future, maybe a sit down conversation to set clear boundaries around food (and anything else applicable) would be in order for you, your husband and sil. If she refuses to adhere to your boundaries then she can find somewhere else to freeload. \n\nAn apology from both of you is also probably a good idea, her for eating your food and not replacing it, and you for having an emotional response that escalated an otherwise nuisance situation.", "NTA.

Even if your SIL knows she is not supposed to eat your food, even if she has been told before not to do so, jumping right to screaming at her was wrong and rude.  Start thinking like a parent.

She could have eaten anything else or waited until you woke up to ask, but nope. She, again, ate your food.

But also you being pregnant and having a craving is no excuse to blow up and scream at someone over pizza. I do get it, I've been pregnant and been super disappointed to find something I wanted to eat is gone, but too many people use pregnancy cravings as an excuse to act like an AH over food. She should have replaced your pizza, but if I were her I absolutely wouldn't have either if you screamed at me.", "YTA. \n\nRemember - being pregnant is not an excuse to be a dick to people.

Screaming was harsh but 5 pieces is absurd.", "NTA.\nIf you\u2019ve never experienced pregnancy or pms, see yourself out. Pregnancy hormones are worse than pms hormones. So for all of the shit females get for being \u201chormonal\u201d when they\u2019ve got pms, somehow we like to erase it for pregnancy because we\u2019re sick of hearing it being used as a reason. It\u2019s a legit reason, but obviously there are limitations with it. Pregnancy fucks your body over with hormones and chemicals and a tiny human taking nutrients from you so that they can grow healthy. Your placenta can give you diabetes. You can be incredibly sick and unable to eat for most or all of your pregnancy. Take some time to understand what actually happens to us while we\u2019re growing future generations.\n\nSecondly, what kind of an ass takes someone\u2019s food? Just because it\u2019s leftovers doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s free for anyone. You ask first. You don\u2019t want to wake the pregnant lady? Ask the husband. If husband says to go for it, tell the pregnant lady that because then the blame is his. If he says he\u2019s not sure, you don\u2019t eat it. If you don\u2019t ask anyone first, *dont fucking eat it*. You didn\u2019t pay for that pizza and you know theres a pregnant person also living there. Or at least order them another one to replace it. It\u2019s what I do when I\u2019ve eaten someone else\u2019s food. I will replace it before they\u2019re home and tell them that I ate it but replaced it. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have yelled, but we all have outbursts and moments where we aren\u2019t going to respond calmly.

And when I craved something, I would fixate on it (hence the obsession). I could eat something else, but if I didn\u2019t eat exactly what the craving was it wouldn\u2019t go away. Now that being said, I had HG (hyperemesis) while pregnant, and I found that most times the only time I didn\u2019t get sick was when I ate what I was craving.

This makes her an AH when she doesn\u2019t ask. So I can understand why you\u2019d lose your temper. But usually screaming at people for eating a craving you had while pregnant isn\u2019t great.
