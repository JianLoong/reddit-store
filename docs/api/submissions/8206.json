No, pregnancy is not an excuse to be abusive, but you were emotional, not abusive. Being loud and yelling is not abusive in itself, and from the sounds of it you were yelling without using abusive language. You loudly told her off, yes, but she ate your food (apparently 5 slices?) that she did not have rights to eat in the first place. \n\nShe should not have eaten your food and when she was told she made a mistake she should have rectified it by ordering you a new one (what was her plan for dinner if you didn't bring the pizza home anyway? to just freeload your food while you're gracious enough to let her stay in your home in her time of need?) In the future, maybe a sit down conversation to set clear boundaries around food (and anything else applicable) would be in order for you, your husband and sil.

She could have eaten anything else or waited until you woke up to ask, but nope. She, again, ate your food.

Screaming was harsh but 5 pieces is absurd.", "NTA.\nIf you\u2019ve never experienced pregnancy or pms, see yourself out. Pregnancy hormones are worse than pms hormones. So for all of the shit females get for being \u201chormonal\u201d when they\u2019ve got pms, somehow we like to erase it for pregnancy because we\u2019re sick of hearing it being used as a reason. It\u2019s a legit reason, but obviously there are limitations with it. Pregnancy fucks your body over with hormones and chemicals and a tiny human taking nutrients from you so that they can grow healthy. Your placenta can give you diabetes. You can be incredibly sick and unable to eat for most or all of your pregnancy. Take some time to understand what actually happens to us while we\u2019re growing future generations.\n\nSecondly, what kind of an ass takes someone\u2019s food? Just because it\u2019s leftovers doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s free for anyone. You ask first. You don\u2019t want to wake the pregnant lady? Ask the husband. If husband says to go for it, tell the pregnant lady that because then the blame is his. If he says he\u2019s not sure, you don\u2019t eat it.

I will replace it before they\u2019re home and tell them that I ate it but replaced it. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have yelled, but we all have outbursts and moments where we aren\u2019t going to respond calmly.

I was boggling at OP having eaten three slices, but I figured that over the course of a few hours and being pregnant and all of that\u2026. But one person eating five slices was crazy to me. Thank you!", "Ahhh. Then yes I would yell", "It's a comment \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "She has done this before even when I wasn\u2019t pregnant", "Not everyone woman experiences pregnancy cravings and aversions the same way. \n\nWhen you are staying at someone\u2019s house as a guest, it\u2019s polite to ask before you take food from the fridge. Specially when you end up eating 5 slices of someone else\u2019s pizza by yourself (assuming it was a large 8-slice pizza).\n\nOh, and SIL ate the breadsticks too!!", "You're welcome. A proper slice for NYC is about... 15%(?) bigger than most chain pizza slices. \nDammit. Now I want pizza. Proper NYC pizza.", "A shitty one.", "Did you scream at her then too?", "I feel like  you should include this in the post! So much more understandable why you would be at the point of yelling when she has repeatedly done thus", "You didn\u2019t answer the question. Do you normally share food or does she buy her own?", "You can't deny acute hormonal changes influence behavior, mood, and emotional stability.\n\nI'm not excusing OPs tantrum. Chill please", "If she had, SIL might not have decided to take the pizza this time :P"]}
