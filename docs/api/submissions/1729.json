His sister (27F) was also there.\n\nHis sister recently went to Turkey for a weight loss procedure. This procedure involves many aftercare rules, most of which she didn\u2019t follow and as a result, she then developed an ulcer which caused a perforation in her stomach which required an emergency surgery the day before we were due to fly home. The surgery went well and she\u2019s recovering well but she wasn\u2019t able to fly home as planned and she has had to remain there in the hospital to recover. Her dad has remained with her. \n\nThe issue is our holiday was to a country where medical care is astronomical and she doesn\u2019t have travel insurance. It\u2019s not that she forgot to get it or couldn\u2019t afford it, she flat out refused to. My bf even offered to pay for it and she still said no, and then went on about how much spending money she\u2019ll have. With the medical bills, rearranging flights and the extended hotel stay, it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money, we\u2019re talking upwards of \u20ac100\u2019000. All of which will be paid for by her parents.\n\nHer friends have set up a GoFundMe under her direction to raise money to put towards this. The problem is, it doesn\u2019t mention anything about the fact that she doesn\u2019t have insurance through her own choices, but instead says insurance won\u2019t cover it. I find this very misleading, and I feel like if people are donating, this should be transparent. The GoFundMe page was also put up before half of her family were even told and we\u2019ve been fielding messages from concerned friends and family who are panicking about what\u2019s happened. \n\nI don\u2019t want to donate because I feel the onus should be on her to work out a payment plan with her parents rather than taking money off others but I do understand this is her way of helping. I also recognise that I can be quite harsh on her, as I\u2019ve known her for 10+ years and she\u2019s never had to face consequences for her actions or face any real responsibility so I\u2019m probably working off biases here.\n\nAny insight or perspective would be great!", "created_utc": 1667839145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yosg6g/wibta_if_i_refused_to_donate_to_her_gofundme/", "score": 221, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well, after I figured out how to get their family member home and tell them the cost is $65,000, the first response always is, OMG, REALLY? WHO PAYS THAT?\nWhen I tell them you do, there is absolute silence.\nFamilies have usually contacted the Canadian government, who in turn contact us to get them home, but the government does NOT pay to bring people home from a foreign country. Families have had to remortgage their homes, borrow from extended family. I have had to process 15 different family credit cards to get people home. The other thing that you don't want is to end up having surgery in a third world country. If you have travel insurance you can be moved to the closest non third world hospital that can help you.\nI had a patient bit by a rabid animal in a country without the rabies injections that they needed and with their insurance, I arranged to have the patient airlifted out to Tokyo where they could get immediate help.\nI had a lady break her femur in Florida. She was flying home and she asked if they would upgrade her because of her broken femur. She was expecting 1st class. Nope, they wouldn't let her board and then red flagged her to other airlines. No airline wants a broken femur onboard because of the risk of DVT's. The only way to get this lady home was by air ambulance at a cost of $23,000. \nThings happen that seem insignificant at the time. A man fell and skinned his knee. No big deal, until it became a very big deal. Bacteria set in and ultimately caused organ failure.

Usually insurance pays a percentage of the sticker price and anyone with insurance is only liable for that reduced amount even if insurance does not pay. But it is also possible that a non-insured person can have a certain percentage taken off if they work with hospital billing.", "Correct (mostly), the high prices are specifically the \"insurance price\" that is previously negotiated between the two corporations, but if you have no insurance at all you pay a much lower price as a \"cash patient\".  To be clear, that cash price is still high compared to European countries, but not as outrageous."]}
