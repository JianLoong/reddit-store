His sister (27F) was also there.\n\nHis sister recently went to Turkey for a weight loss procedure. This procedure involves many aftercare rules, most of which she didn\u2019t follow and as a result, she then developed an ulcer which caused a perforation in her stomach which required an emergency surgery the day before we were due to fly home. The surgery went well and she\u2019s recovering well but she wasn\u2019t able to fly home as planned and she has had to remain there in the hospital to recover. Her dad has remained with her. \n\nThe issue is our holiday was to a country where medical care is astronomical and she doesn\u2019t have travel insurance. It\u2019s not that she forgot to get it or couldn\u2019t afford it, she flat out refused to. My bf even offered to pay for it and she still said no, and then went on about how much spending money she\u2019ll have. With the medical bills, rearranging flights and the extended hotel stay, it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money, we\u2019re talking upwards of \u20ac100\u2019000. All of which will be paid for by her parents.\n\nHer friends have set up a GoFundMe under her direction to raise money to put towards this. The problem is, it doesn\u2019t mention anything about the fact that she doesn\u2019t have insurance through her own choices, but instead says insurance won\u2019t cover it. I find this very misleading, and I feel like if people are donating, this should be transparent. The GoFundMe page was also put up before half of her family were even told and we\u2019ve been fielding messages from concerned friends and family who are panicking about what\u2019s happened. \n\nI don\u2019t want to donate because I feel the onus should be on her to work out a payment plan with her parents rather than taking money off others but I do understand this is her way of helping. I also recognise that I can be quite harsh on her, as I\u2019ve known her for 10+ years and she\u2019s never had to face consequences for her actions or face any real responsibility so I\u2019m probably working off biases here.\n\nAny insight or perspective would be great!", "created_utc": 1667839145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yosg6g/wibta_if_i_refused_to_donate_to_her_gofundme/", "score": 509, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well, after I figured out how to get their family member home and tell them the cost is $65,000, the first response always is, OMG, REALLY? WHO PAYS THAT?\nWhen I tell them you do, there is absolute silence.\nFamilies have usually contacted the Canadian government, who in turn contact us to get them home, but the government does NOT pay to bring people home from a foreign country. Families have had to remortgage their homes, borrow from extended family. I have had to process 15 different family credit cards to get people home. The other thing that you don't want is to end up having surgery in a third world country. If you have travel insurance you can be moved to the closest non third world hospital that can help you.\nI had a patient bit by a rabid animal in a country without the rabies injections that they needed and with their insurance, I arranged to have the patient airlifted out to Tokyo where they could get immediate help.\nI had a lady break her femur in Florida. She was flying home and she asked if they would upgrade her because of her broken femur. She was expecting 1st class. Nope, they wouldn't let her board and then red flagged her to other airlines. No airline wants a broken femur onboard because of the risk of DVT's. The only way to get this lady home was by air ambulance at a cost of $23,000. \nThings happen that seem insignificant at the time. A man fell and skinned his knee. No big deal, until it became a very big deal. Bacteria set in and ultimately caused organ failure.

I would not be surprised if her parents told her not to pay them back and she went on a shopping spree instead. To me, this is not a case of someone in need of money.", "She should probably check to see if she is eligible for any state benefits.  Or see if she can sign up for the affordable care program. I don't think you have to be a citizen to do it.", "NTA - however, regardless of whether you donate, it sounds like she still isn\u2019t going to have to face the consequence. Sounds like your donation would be helping her parents\u2026not necessarily her. Either way, you don\u2019t have to donate though and are NOT the AH", "NTA. I totally get it, I would never even think about visiting the US without travel health insurance. And I certainly wouldn't donate to this go fund me. . That said, how bad can it realistically get? Debt collection is a highly nationalised business and many American businesses don't actually realize that people live in other countries (it's outside of their scope of comprehension). Yes, people in the US go bankrupt over medical debt, but are you certain that this would happen to your in-laws?", "I get the feeling she ate when she was meant to be on small sips of liquids", "You\u2019re NTA, but she\u2019s right that travel insurance doesn\u2019t cover overseas medical procedures  - unless there\u2019s a platinum one that does. - sorry I misread and thought she had had the procedure on the same holiday (which insurers explicitly ask about). Ignore me!", "Yeah but it\u2019s a little bit on him, very few people grow up into a spoiled adult who expects someone else to fix their screwups without their parents assisting.", "I'm self pay and had an emergency surgery this year. They will give a discounted price, but it's a set percentage and you usually have to pay it in a certain timeframe. For the hospital they gave me 3 months to pay it in full for the discount and for regular Dr. appointments some are same day paid in full and some give you like 2 weeks.", "Uuuuuh no.\n\nYou can file for bankruptcy, I guess? Try and get a settlement that way?\n\nBut no, no haggling.", "All the best with your procedure!", "Nta, if everyone bails her out , she won't learn anything.", "If they call up the hospital billing department the bill is usually negotiable to some degree. Explain the situation and they will help set up a payment plan.\n\nSource: my mom used to work in hospital billing department in the US, a LOT of people never pay the full bill", "Do everything they tell you too in after care. And Don't do the things they tell you not to do.  A coworker of mine drank mountain dew a couple months after she had this surgery and suffered greatly for it. She thought a little wouldn't hurt.", "You totally got this. I had bariatric surgery back in 2017. Best choice I ever made. But for SURE follow the after care your doctor recommends.", "I just had bariatric surgery a week ago and my out of pocket is $1,155.00. The procedure is 92k and I asked the hospital what happens if someone doesn't have insurance. They advised there is a 40% reduction. I lt blew my mind and I am grateful for my insurance.", "Had a friend who had the same surgery. He wasn\u2019t thinking and took a big swig of Dr. Pepper. Said he learned really fast\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve already given up soda. So that won\u2019t be a problem. And I haven\u2019t had alcohol in over 30 years, so no beer. \n\nThe toughest part for me will not be drinking during/30 minutes after eating. That\u2019s tough.", "i love when people make blanket assumptions and just look rude and silly when they\u2019re inevitably told they\u2019re wrong", "Yes would be hard to give up even a small drink while eating.", "NTA.\n\nI wonder if this sort of thing has happened before.\n\nI am not referring to the use of GoFundMe but rather your BF's sister making irresponsible choices and then having others cover the costs/consequences of those decisions.\n\nIf so, that may explain her attitude.\n\nYou have no responsibility to help cover her expenses, and it is very telling that the GoFundMe is misleading to others.\n\nTechnically in this case, \"misleading\" actually means \"fraudulent\".", "Just out of curiosity, after the healing, can you eat most things you did before?  I like to travel and try foods in the places I go. I know it will be much smaller quantities, of course, and not the everyday routine to do this.", "Can you do as your username says and be silent?", "Yup! It took about 6 -12 months to be able to eat everything (in particular I had trouble with ground beef but that was like the last holdout and that\u2019s all cleared up). I will say- there will be foods that hit you harder afterwards. So for example- breads/pastas/fries are foods that hit me like turkey hits other people. My dad (who also had bariatric surgery back in like\u20262003ish) has trouble with anything high in sugar. He can eat it but he has to be very mindful of serving size.", "I understand why you don't want to pay. She acted stupid and faces the consequences and lies to people. I would not want to help too. But I would give the minimum money that I can give. Because, all responders seem to forget, there are words like kindness, goodness, humanity etc. Giving minimum won't hurt you. Seeing and not caring someone suffering will. Even if he/she doesn't deserve, not caring kills a little piece of your soul. World being full of bad people doesn't mean that we need to be one of them.", "Uyngnv", "NTA.\n\nA wise person said to me \"if you can't afford insurance, you can't afford to travel.\"\n\nMy ex workmate's partner broke his back when travelling and they ended up getting over $1mil out of it, plus access to cutting edge medical techniques. Last time I talked to her, he was able to stand.\n\nNot getting travel insurance ESPECIALLY after major surgery (also, why would you travel after major surgery???) is so incredibly foolish I cannot fathom what was going through her mind.\n\nShe made her bed, now she's got to lie in it.", "INFO: why not just... not pay the medical bills? If your holiday was to the US, as an American I encourage them to not spend a dime. I abandoned all of my medical debt when I left the country to move elsewhere and I regret none of it.", "Not entirely, especially based on some of the advice I\u2019ve gotten here! They had a chat with the accounting team yesterday and they mentioned there are certain things they can do that will significantly lower the full price", "Honestly didn\u2019t know this was an option, but this seems to be the advice we\u2019ve gotten from a few different places so myself and my bf are going to sit the parents down and talk it through with them\u2026", "It was to the US, and you guys aren't from the US so... why pay at all? I'm a US citizen and I never paid my medical bills when I lived there. I've since moved to another country and there's nothing they can do about it. There's no reason I can think of to pay at all; it's not like they can do anything about it.", "Definitely do, paying is a fool\u2019s task.", "Nah, the insurance is a waste. Just don't pay, not like the money grubbers can do anything to a non-citizen.", "Especially if it costs next to nothing. Here in Germany travel health insurance for a year, including the US, costs something like 40-50\u20ac.\n\nShe ist just plain stupid. NTA", "Tbf to him, he was in the same mindset as me about it but she\u2019s been pressuring him to share it around and he\u2019s done so to keep the peace but he\u2019s continuously told me that I shouldn\u2019t feel obligated in any way to donate/share etc \n\nBut thank you, you\u2019ve summed up exactly how I feel about it!", "We\u2019ve never had a medical emergency over there but we\u2019ve heard horror stories about debt collectors and the like so we assumed they had some way of chasing it down, but I\u2019ve seen a lot of advice here to simply not pay so it\u2019s definitely an option we\u2019re going to discuss with her parents", "They\u2019re powerless over you if you aren\u2019t there to collect on. I abandoned all of my student loan debt as well and nothing has come of it. It\u2019d probably bite me in the ass if I ever moved back there but, but I have no intention of ever doing that if I can get away with it.", "NTA\n\nyour brother offered to pay for it already and she said no... why back track now??? Something is fishy and that goFundme is misleading as you said. She knows this is her fault and she messed up. Your right that this should be something she sorts out with her parents because misleading others over this is just wrong.\n\nHe math is not mathing here. She doesn't want to take money from her parents but is willing to take from others (Possibly strangers)  who she knows do not have all the information? Suspicious. She has access to the money. No reason for you to donate.", "Definitely NTA. I wouldn't donate either. If possible, I would probably even go as far as to comment on the donation site, for all to see, to clear up any inaccurate information posted on the GoFundMe page. I would be extremely upset if I donated to someone who was misleading me in any way.", "If you don\u2019t live in the US you could just not pay. There\u2019s nothing they can do. \n\nThe one thing the US is great for is emergency health care services. You can\u2019t get turned away and you will get excellent care. Lucky for your SIL she doesn\u2019t live here so she will face zero financial consequences from simply walking away. I think it would be really dumb if your family decides to pay this bill.", "I\u2019m starting to think this is the best option!", "I love how people make throw away account then give a detailed story that would likely be obvious to anyone that knows the situation", "Nta. I thought it was common knowledge that the US healthcare system is one of the most expensive on the planet! I stand corrected due to your friends poor choices!", "NTA always get travel insurance, rookie move.", "Haha fair point!", "Can donate straight to the parents. They are the ones who will be suffering the most on the financials.  may not agree with her direction in life or the part of the parents to enable it however it is medical. It would be petty not to give something to the parents for support even if it\u2019s a nice dinner when they return. The stress the parents must be under. I wouldn\u2019t want to be them. Cheers", "That\u2019s my plan anyway! We\u2019ve paid for two extra nights in the hotel for them and we\u2019ve stocked up their house for when they return too, and I\u2019m more than happy to contribute financially in other ways", "I mean, if this is any other country, I'd be like \"you can't not pay for a service they've provided\". But seeing this is US where bills are mind blowing, I'd say floor it.\n\nIf she is willing to lie to get amount for the surgery, then she would be fine with walking away without paying the bill. Just make sure there would be no consequences for that", "Amazing!! didn\u2019t even need Reddit to be awesome. also NTA for the sister.", "Yeah the family has some friends who are doctors in New York and they low-key suggested not paying too so I think that\u2019s the current plan"]}
