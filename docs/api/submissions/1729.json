His sister (27F) was also there.\n\nHis sister recently went to Turkey for a weight loss procedure. This procedure involves many aftercare rules, most of which she didn\u2019t follow and as a result, she then developed an ulcer which caused a perforation in her stomach which required an emergency surgery the day before we were due to fly home. The surgery went well and she\u2019s recovering well but she wasn\u2019t able to fly home as planned and she has had to remain there in the hospital to recover. Her dad has remained with her. \n\nThe issue is our holiday was to a country where medical care is astronomical and she doesn\u2019t have travel insurance. It\u2019s not that she forgot to get it or couldn\u2019t afford it, she flat out refused to. My bf even offered to pay for it and she still said no, and then went on about how much spending money she\u2019ll have. With the medical bills, rearranging flights and the extended hotel stay, it\u2019s going to cost a lot of money, we\u2019re talking upwards of \u20ac100\u2019000. All of which will be paid for by her parents.\n\nHer friends have set up a GoFundMe under her direction to raise money to put towards this. The problem is, it doesn\u2019t mention anything about the fact that she doesn\u2019t have insurance through her own choices, but instead says insurance won\u2019t cover it. I find this very misleading, and I feel like if people are donating, this should be transparent. The GoFundMe page was also put up before half of her family were even told and we\u2019ve been fielding messages from concerned friends and family who are panicking about what\u2019s happened. \n\nI don\u2019t want to donate because I feel the onus should be on her to work out a payment plan with her parents rather than taking money off others but I do understand this is her way of helping. I also recognise that I can be quite harsh on her, as I\u2019ve known her for 10+ years and she\u2019s never had to face consequences for her actions or face any real responsibility so I\u2019m probably working off biases here.\n\nAny insight or perspective would be great!", "created_utc": 1667839145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yosg6g/wibta_if_i_refused_to_donate_to_her_gofundme/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she can't follow medical advice so soon after surgery when it impacts her healing/health in a serious manner, she is not going to be able to successfully keep the weight off because weight loss surgery isn't a cure - it is just a tool to help and the person has to be willing to change their lifestyle in the long term.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation to donate to the GoFundMe account.
