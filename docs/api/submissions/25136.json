They're both born in August so they pick a weekend that works for everyone and we all go on a small road trip vacation. They started this tradition a few years before I became really close with them (I started attending when they were 19 and I was 17) but to my knowledge there were never any issues in the years before I started coming, and I know there haven't been any since.\r  \n\r  \nThere's usually a group of five of us, with our friends Nathan and Nick also in attendance. Other people have joined, especially during Chris's college years, and it's always still been great. The two groups usually seamlessly meld together and even lead to independent friendships outside of groups settings. My point is, it's always a great time and there have never been any issues before, extra guests or not.\r  \n\r  \nThis year, Matt's girlfriend attended. Things  got off to a rocky start since, instead of carpooling the way we typically do (Matt and Chris in one car + me, Nate, and Nick in the other or all riding together), she wanted to ride with him separately. We could tell this annoyed Matt - the drive there and back is usually a highlight of our trip - but he agreed.\r  \n\r  \nOver the course of the four nights we were there, she was miserable for all them. These trips are usually very unstructured (we hang out, walk to nearby shops/restaurants, roast smores in a firepit on the beach) and she just seemed restless. She continually suggested we drive to a fancier restaurant for a birthday meal and everyone kept politely sidestepping the topic. Chris would come to us pissed off every single night because she would interrupt them, beg Matt for at least 30 minutes to come to bed with her at 11pm, then eventually go to bed by herself when he wouldn't.\r  \n\r  \nI guess it was because I was the only other woman there, but she began clinging to me on night two..

Was this the first time everyone in your friend group met her? If so, I could see that adding to the stress. \n\nAlso, was there a reason her choice of dining and other suggestions were turned down? You say yourself that these events are unstructured, so I don\u2019t get why her making suggestions of things to do was \u201cside stepped\u201d and seemingly frowned upon. What\u2019s wrong with going out to eat one day on a multi-day trip?\n\nIt is weird for everyone to leave her alone without telling her they were leaving. That would rub me the wrong way if my partner and all of his group of friends left me in an unfamiliar place alone.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Matt started the trip letting his friends know he was annoyed he drove with her instead of with you and Chris, so from the get-go, she is being treated like she is disrupting. \n\nSo in regards to how she was treated, the group and Matt were all pretty mean and cold to her.\n\nHer calling you a \u201cpick-me\u201d girl is out of line and probably came out of her being jealous that you get along with everyone while she doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt was nice of you to hear her out, especially with how cold everyone else seemed to be treating her.\n\nLastly, telling her to leave at 2 AM is absurd in general. Compromising to leave in the morning makes more sense.\n\nAnyway, I hope she and Matt break up and she never has an experience like this again.

Every single one of you sucks for dipping out to a diner at 2 AM and not telling her where you were going, or even that you were leaving. And my god, you are all WILDLY TA for kicking her out in the middle of the night. Lord in heaven.\n\nShe also did the wrong thing by complaining to you about your friends.

You and your friends brought her along and actively worked to exclude her.", "I'm going with ESH.  She sounds a bit annoying yes, but I get the sense that maybe she was feeling left out, since she's never been on these trips with you before.

And all of you sound like you don't understand how romantic relationships are supposed to work.  \n\nI don't think you said how long they have been together, but if they've been together for a bit, she should start to be more important to him, and he to her.  In a healthy relationship, the partner comes first, not y'all.

So I don't think you are to blame for this situation, but I do think that all of you could have done better.\n\nIt sounds like this person was annoying on the trip, but leaving her alone at night in an unfamiliar place is a dick move. How hard would it have been to wake her and let her know you guys were going out? I can't imagine going on a trip with people and waking up alone at the hotel with no idea where anyone else had went. Boy, girl, dinosaur, I'd have been upset.\n\nMaking her drive home alone at 2am is also a dick move. Why not just have her drive home in the morning? Sending her off immediately in the middle of the night when she's upset is a terrible idea. That's Matt's fault because he told her to leave, but how would you have felt if she had fallen asleep at the wheel that night and crashed or something? It's not your responsibility to stick up for her out of some sisterhood thing, but I do feel like everyone in your group is at fault for not having enough common sense and awareness to know that driving in the middle of the night isn't the safest thing to do.
