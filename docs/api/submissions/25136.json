Was this the first time everyone in your friend group met her? If so, I could see that adding to the stress. \n\nAlso, was there a reason her choice of dining and other suggestions were turned down? You say yourself that these events are unstructured, so I don\u2019t get why her making suggestions of things to do was \u201cside stepped\u201d and seemingly frowned upon. What\u2019s wrong with going out to eat one day on a multi-day trip?\n\nIt is weird for everyone to leave her alone without telling her they were leaving. That would rub me the wrong way if my partner and all of his group of friends left me in an unfamiliar place alone.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Matt started the trip letting his friends know he was annoyed he drove with her instead of with you and Chris, so from the get-go, she is being treated like she is disrupting. \n\nSo in regards to how she was treated, the group and Matt were all pretty mean and cold to her.\n\nHer calling you a \u201cpick-me\u201d girl is out of line and probably came out of her being jealous that you get along with everyone while she doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt was nice of you to hear her out, especially with how cold everyone else seemed to be treating her.\n\nLastly, telling her to leave at 2 AM is absurd in general. Compromising to leave in the morning makes more sense.\n\nAnyway, I hope she and Matt break up and she never has an experience like this again.

(I can't even fault her for suggesting a nice restaurant for a birthday meal for her boyfriend. That feels like pretty normal being-a-good-partner behavior.) Every single one of you sucks for dipping out to a diner at 2 AM and not telling her where you were going, or even that you were leaving. And my god, you are all WILDLY TA for kicking her out in the middle of the night. Lord in heaven.\n\nShe also did the wrong thing by complaining to you about your friends.

You and your friends brought her along and actively worked to exclude her.", "I'm going with ESH.  She sounds a bit annoying yes, but I get the sense that maybe she was feeling left out, since she's never been on these trips with you before.

And all of you sound like you don't understand how romantic relationships are supposed to work.  \n\nI don't think you said how long they have been together, but if they've been together for a bit, she should start to be more important to him, and he to her.  In a healthy relationship, the partner comes first, not y'all.

Or not be scared to do your own thing if you really want to.\n\nNow I'm not going to say you are a \"pick me\" girl, but blasting her during the trip to everyone, is an.. interesting move.

So I don't think you are to blame for this situation, but I do think that all of you could have done better.\n\nIt sounds like this person was annoying on the trip, but leaving her alone at night in an unfamiliar place is a dick move. How hard would it have been to wake her and let her know you guys were going out? I can't imagine going on a trip with people and waking up alone at the hotel with no idea where anyone else had went. Boy, girl, dinosaur, I'd have been upset.\n\nMaking her drive home alone at 2am is also a dick move. Why not just have her drive home in the morning? Sending her off immediately in the middle of the night when she's upset is a terrible idea. That's Matt's fault because he told her to leave, but how would you have felt if she had fallen asleep at the wheel that night and crashed or something? It's not your responsibility to stick up for her out of some sisterhood thing, but I do feel like everyone in your group is at fault for not having enough common sense and awareness to know that driving in the middle of the night isn't the safest thing to do.

Because both are rude.\n\nI mean, it sounds like they like this location because everything is in walking distance and they just want to chill and not worry about driving. Can all six of them fit in one car? If yes and she volunteered to drive then maybe I could see her point but if not (or she wants to drive just with her boyfriend like the trip there) she's basically volunteering someone else to drive, not drink for a night on their short vacation and spend money on an expensive meal when they normally do cheap local restaurants and diners. \n\nAt their age I certainly wouldn't have a fancy meal in my budget when the plan is a campfire food and diner weekend.", "This! It is laughable that OP thinks she's a \"girl's girl\" when it is clear that she's a \"not like other girls\" girl.", "I also don\u2019t think anyone wanted her to come. She invited herself and probably did so by manipulating Matt over not loving her if he didn\u2019t want her there.", "So, you cannot be trusted to keep someone's secrets in confidence if it involves someone who is your friend? Got it.", "Someone who is, essentially, a stranger to you, over sharing at you and talking negatively about your close friend, should have no reason to expect your silence on the matter.", "If that someone is practically a stranger to me? Unless there are some truly serious extenuating circumstances, no, I can't be trusted to keep their secrets at all.", "Naturally. And you can tell them that, and tell them that you would rather not have this conversation for this reason. Listening to someone vent, then running to tell the person they were venting about? Snake move."]}
