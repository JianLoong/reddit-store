Im so sorry you have had to hear your cousin tell you about your cat dying soon which I hope is not true! your parents and your cousin are the TAs because why would your parents tell you that you should never leave the room when you\\`re heartbroken about what your cousin has said about your cat so basically you needed alone time and thats okay! your cousin\\`s also the TA because he does not seem to care about your cat if he cared about your cat and you he would not say that to you about your cat which digusts me and breaks my heart into pieces.
