My older cat that lives with my family had some stomach problems (she swallowed a hair tie) and because of that she\u2019ve lost weight. Last week she pooped the hair tie and started to gain the weight that she had lost. During recovery, one of my old cousins (38M) visited me with his family since I came back home for semester break. He saw my old cat and said that luckily she looks like she\u2019s going to die soon. I asked him about his inappropriate comment and he said \u201cLook at her, she looks like she\u2019ll die soon. I hope she dies and at least we can get rid of one of your cats.\u201d I\u2019m so sensitive about my cats and this comment broke my heart. I started to cry and I hate crying in public so I rushed into my room and didn\u2019t leave my room since they left our home. After they left, my mom and dad came to my room and they were so pissed at me. They said that they are our guests and you should never leave the room. I told them what was happened (even though my dad was there during this happened but my mom was at the kitchen). They said that I should go and say sorry because of my disrespectful behaviour.

Yeah, your choice was to breakdown vying in front of them which could lead to more cruel comments or leave the room. Your were basically stuck between a rock and a hard lance.
