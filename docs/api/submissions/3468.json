They leave this coming Saturday and come back the following Saturday.  Months ago, when they were first planning this trip, my sister asked me (29F) if I would be willing to stay at their house and watch their 2 kids (8 & 6) and their dog while they are gone.  \n\nI can work from home, so I would still be able to work from their place.  And their kids are in school during the day so I would have time to get all my work done before they get home.  My sister said they can also pay me $750 for the week and will have the fridge and pantry stocked with food so that I don't have to worry about any of that either.  I was a little hesitant about it because I've never watched kids for that long before, but I did end up agreeing.\n\nAt our family Thanksgiving last week, my BIL was talking about a date that he and my sister recently went on and how expensive it was to find a good babysitter.  He said they found one they really like who is great with their kids, so they have no problem paying her $25/hour because they trust her and the kids like her.  \n\nI did some quick math in my head and realized that they were only paying me like $100 A DAY when I'm going to be in charge of their kids for an entire week.  My BIL was shelling out $100 to their babysitter for a 4-hour dinner and movie date.  \n\nI made a comment that if they can afford to pay a babysitter that much for a few hours, they should be paying me the same rate when I'm watching their kids.  My BIL at first kind of laughed it off, but I told him I was serious and if he wants me to watch his kids for an entire week, I want the same rate as they would pay their regular babysitter.  \n\nHe told me that we had already agreed on the terms of me watching their kids, but I told him that I want to change those terms, or I am not going to watch them and they'll have to find someone else.  He got pissed and called my sister over.  He explained what was happening and my sister got pissed at me too.  She said we had already agreed and since the kids will be in school and I can still work, it's not like I'm missing out on income and am also saving on food for the week.  \n\nI stood firm and told them that unless they increase what they are paying me, I am backing out of our arrangement.  There was some back and forth, but my sister eventually agreed to pay me $1000 instead of the $750.  \n\nRight after that, my BIL grabbed their kids and they left.  He walked past me on their way out and said \"You better hope you don't need to ask us for anything anytime soon you f#\\*&ing extortionist b!tch.\"  I told him if he keeps that attitude up, I'll demand another thousand.  \n\nAfter they left my mom and dad were also pissed at me.  They said that I was wrong to force my sister and BIL into that and that isn't the way we treat family.  I told them that I wasn't going to allow myself to be taken advantage of just because we share DNA.", "created_utc": 1669670775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z79319/aita_for_demanding_that_i_get_paid_more_to_watch/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I found out they routinely pay their regular babysitter much more than they are paying me to watch their kids.  So I demanded they pay me more or I'm not going to do it.  My sister eventually agreed to pay me more, but still not as much as they pay their normal sitter.

The babysitter was paid that hourly to watch the children. Youre going to be there alone when they're at school and will be working. \n\n2. Professional babysitters have qualifications, dbs checks, insurance thats why they charge a higher price. Do you have any of those things? \n\n3. If they were going to pay that much obviously they'd go with the actual professional. \n\n4. You were happy to do it for the \u00a3750 why are you now trying to make money out of your family.\n\n5. Changing the terms last minute after everything is agreed is an ah move.\n\n6. Asking a favor and paying for it isn't taking advantage of someone. People don't usually charge close family members prices that a professional would especially if that person wasn't a professional and wasn't losing out on any money by doing the favor. What a weird approach to take to your own sister and neices/nephews.", "YTA\n\nIsn't this extortion? This feels like extortion. Oh I see the BIL called it out too so it's not just me.  \n\n\nYou already agreed to it, they're also covering food and lodging for you. You waited until they'd have to either pay more or cancel their vacation... Unlike babysitters you'll be working your OTHER job as well while doing this... Yeah don't count on them ever asking you for anything again and badmouthing you to everyone so... I hope you're prepared to go LC with a whole lot of people.", "YTA. You do realize the babysitter gets that rate for watching the kids the entire time, right? For you, the kids will be asleep or in school the majority of the time. You sound like an immature brat making these \"demands\".", "YTA. You already agreed to their terms. To pay the amount you're asking would be ridiculous and not worth it regardless of your relationship with their kids.", "YTA. You agreed to do the work for $750 and decided a week before you wanted more when they are basically stuck paying you more or missing their vacation. If you didn't like the terms, you shouldn't have agreed.", "YTA.... you agreed months ago... and you're family... you extorted them for an additional $250 on top of \" better not keep that up or il add another thousand \"......\n I'm sorry you're clearly not as financially well off as your sister but this screams of  jealousy and passive aggressiveness.. \n\n$750 is more than fair to watch your niece and nephew for one week , with 0 costs of your own to incur & food provided...", "YTA and really immature for being almost 30.\n\n1) You already agreed on the terms (which were completely reasonable) - reneging after the fact to squeeze them for more cash is a jerk move.\n\n2) the babysitter is getting paid an hourly rate for hours they would be actively engaged with the kids - you\u2019re there all week, but you\u2019re only actively watching the kids for the few hours between them coming from school and going to bed.\n\n3) They\u2019re including food - how much would a week\u2019s worth of groceries normally cost you?", "YTA. In a time where information is at your fingertips 24/7 you could have looked up pay rates prior to agreeing. That's on you. You agreed to a set amount and got $$$ in your eyes when you realized you could have negotiated more up front. You went back on that. BIL is right, you'd better hope you *never* need their help because you lost all their good will. I hope an extra $250 was worth it.", "YTA. You had a really good deal that made both parties happy. You just got greedy when you found out there was more that you could extort. If you were really concerned about the pay from the get go, you would/should have asked about rates/the flat amount BEFORE you agreed. Now you just look as greedy and dishonest as you are.", "YTA. You agreed to the terms\n\nBabysitting is different than what you're doing. That's a person who's coming over and has to focus on the kids the entire time.\n\nThey're feeding you, paying you and you can still work etc.\n\nNow, maybe you realized $750 was a bit low ball. But you certainly could have brought that up in a far more tactful, far less extortionate way. Frankly $750 seems fine to me.\n\nYou come off as conniving, greedy and condescending. Nothing you describe here was really ok or cool.", "YTA.\nAside from the fact that paying 25 an hour for a date night is far different than 25 an hour for an entire week, in which over half the time they'll be either sleeping or in school....you are family. You can be as transactional as you'd like but they planned and paid for a vacation because you agreed to the financial terms they offered...taking back your acceptance or demanding more money this late in the game is awful. You should call and apologize and go back to the original agreed upon rate.", "Let's be clear about the times that you'll actually be working here.\n\nYou'll get the kids ready for school in the morning, make their lunch, and probably walk / drive them to school. That's probably 1.5 hours.\n\nThen you'll pick them up from school, feed them dinner, and supervise them until bedtime (which might include reminding them to do their homework). Probably 4 hours, including putting them to bed.\n\nSo you're looking at 5.5-6 hours per day of being in charge of two awake children. In addition, you accept the constraint that you have to stay in the house at night, and can't go out.\n\nFor this, you were being offered $750 plus free food. You think you're being exploited because they pay their regular babysitter $25/hour.\n\nYTA for agreeing to this, and then coming back to demand more. That makes you the clear AH.\n\nAs it happens, I think $750 for the week is fair. I'd certainly do it for that. You're entitled to think otherwise, but are an AH for agreeing to terms and then changing your mind.", "YTA. The kids are going to be in school most of the day, ,you are getting food at no cost, you are saving on utilities at your place because you are going to be at their place, and you are not missing any work or using any PTO to watch them. \n\nYep, you better hope you don't need their help anytime soon.", "YTA  You already agreed to the amount and you extorted a week before the trip.", "YTA. Aren\u2019t the kids in school most of the time you\u2019re there?", "YTA. You already agreed to help your sister.", "YTA. You already agreed to $750, and then demanded more. This is your family you were shaking down! Many people care for family members for free, yet you are all about the money. How sad.", "YTA\n\nThere's a huge difference between an aunt caring for relatives for a week and hiring a babysitter for an evening.\n\nThe rate is NOT the same...even if you weren't related...for a week of watching. It isnt' $25/hr for 168 hours. \n\nIn many families, there wouldn't be any pay for watching relatives for a week. It was pretty generous on top of your normal work. The kids will be in school for most of the day and will go to bed early.\n\nYou should tell them you didn't understand what you were asking for as you have no kids and you're excited to spend time with your niece and nephew.\n\nBut, if I were them, I'd find someone else to care for everyone.", "YTA.. they were paying you pretty generously considering the kids will be at school and you still get to work.. \nyou can\u2019t just change the terms bc you no longer like them.\n\nBIL is right, better hope you don\u2019t need a favor from him bc it\u2019s going to cost you a chunk of change.", "YTA. I would watch my nieces and nephews for free because they are my family. Short of any massive dysfunction, I\u2019m shocked by your ask. The fact that they even were willing to pay you $750 and provide all the groceries is kind of wild to me. The kids are also 6 & 8 meaning they are not babies who need your attention constantly. With kids this age you could easily kill time by going to a movie with them or and arcade. It\u2019s literally not hard to be with kids at this age. I will never understand people who treat family like regular people. Being family and sharing dna actually should mean something.", "My husband and I went on a trip for 11 days last year with my mother and sister both staying at our house to watch my 10 and 3 year old. They did this for free. I did send my sister a case of wine and offered money but she declined as this is her family! It was amazing memories for all and all asked for a repeat. While you shouldn\u2019t be expected to do this for free, you certainly shouldn\u2019t be extorting either. Are you close to your sister? Niece and nephew? YTA", "YTA. There\u2019s a reason they asked for your help instead of hiring the babysitter for that full time. You\u2019re not staying at their place, working there, and eating their food too. \n\nYou already agreed to the given rate\u2014if money was your concern instead of helping out your family, why didn\u2019t you do some research about how much babysitting rates go for when the offer was first discussed? \n\nIt\u2019s a scummy thing for anyone to back out of an agreement like that after already agreeing, but especially to squeeze some more money out of your own relatives.", "Oh yes, you are most certainly TA. Has it even occurred to you that this person may have a background in child care, or is certified in first aid and/CPR, or is in some other way(s) more qualified than you? Also you made a deal and then you backed out, you can never be trusted again. YTA.", "YTA. Damn. \n\nIf I were them I would never ask another thing of you again, and I sure as heck wouldn't offer to help you with anything. This would probably be the end of any kind of amicable relationship we might have had.\n\nIf you didn't think the pay was a fair use of your time, you should have said so before agreeing to it. Now they've made their plans and you have them over a barrel.", "YTA. The moment to decide a good rate was when they asked, not weeks later when you realize you can get more out of them. You decided A WEEK before the trip to change your mind after hearing you could have gotten more out of them. You knew they couldn\u2019t disagree without cancelling their trip, and you used that against them.\n\nIf you\u2019re being underpaid, you bring it up AFTER the agreement is done, letting them know you\u2019d like [X] amount per hour. If you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s worth, check online for rates in your area and decide from there. Congrats, though: not only will you never get another babysitting job from then in the future, the rest of their family will know you\u2019re willing to extort to get extra cash and won\u2019t ask you either.", "YTA, \ud83d\udcaf. She's your sister and they are your niece and nephew. No family members demand what you demand. Have literally never heard of a single instance from anyone I've ever met.", "YTA. You won't be caring for the kids full time, you'll be looking after them morning and evening only. 750 is a fair rate, and surely there is some element here of doing you sister a favour, to be nice? Apparently not. You've got you 250 extra but at the cost of everyone in your family knowing your the AH.", "YTA, and exactly what your BIL called you. Shame on you.", "YTA", "yta and he\u2019s right i REALLY hope you never need anything because they will remember this. paying $100 for one day is different then every day. and family is suppose to be more caring and you would have the kids in school most of the day so not even a full day of work.", "YTA- family vs sitter. My sitter is paid by the hour for dates. But a week long vacation based by the hour is ridiculous. Hope you weren't close to your nieces and nephews cause the petty in me would keep you away from them forever. You knew they would now be in a tight spot with your new demands. BUT who know who cares not like it's your sister. He's right it is extortion", "YTA, they are family and giving you $750 for the week and food is reasonable. You agreed then changed the agreement. On the weekend you can take them to your parents home, it doesn't seem like they live far away. They are going to school so you are watching them after that and you are still working your other job. \nPray that you never need a favor from them as be sure they will charge you. Getting married one-day? Well don't depend on them to participate in your wedding without a fee or everything paid for by you and expect a crappy gift.", "YTA. Lots of other people listed the reasons so I leave you with; I really really hope you call your sister to apologize and stay with the 750. \n\nMy sister (37) also has a kid (2) and I (26) watch him for free. Of course not over such a long time, but honestly, if I\u2019d be able to get my job done and I\u2019d have enough food and everything for us, that would be enough for me. I wouldn\u2019t even dream about demanding $1000. I\u2019m not saying you should do it \u201cfor free\u201d like I would but they already offered you $750. Is it really worth it to destroy your relationship with your sister for $250?", "I mean he's not wrong you better hope you never need thier help", "YTA you are a massive, entitled asshole.", "INFO: what made you think they were paying you less because you were family and not just because a weekly rate is billed much differently then an hourly rate?", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA. They asked you to babysit, are going to give you 750 dollars and stick the fridge. You agreed to those terms and then decided to go back on them. End of the day you\u2019re family, you should want to help your sister out not extort them for more money.", "\"\"You better hope you don't need to ask us for anything anytime soon you f#\\*&ing extortionist b!tch.\"\n\nI'm so confused, am I supposed to be offended? He's certainly not wrong.\n\n\"After they left my mom and dad were also pissed at me. They said that I was wrong to force my sister and BIL into that and that isn't the way we treat family.\"\n\nYour parents are right. A LOT of people do this for family members at no charge. You were being paid a perfectly reasonable price, they're in school and it's not interfering with your work, and you're not going to be buying groceries the entire week. Most importantly, you AGREED to the price they offered you. What they paid that babysitter is irrelevant, it was too late to start demanding more, and you should not be paid the same as their babysitter because it's not a similar arrangement (one date night versus a week of just watching over them in the evenings), you're family, and that babysitter has experience.\n\nAnd how dare you say they're taking advantage of you. HOW are they taking advantage of you?! They didn't scream \"but faaamily\" and try to demand free babysitting, what sort of nonsense is this?! YOU ARE THE ONE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION. And then you throw a fit when you're called out on what you did by threatening to extort them for more money, fully knowing how hard it would be to find an actual sitter this closer to their vacation.\n\nCongratulations, you just ruined your relationship with your sister and her family. And no one in your family is going to think too highly of you either after this stunt of yours.\n\nYTA, but asshole does not even begin to cover it.", "YTA - You were doing them a favour and this was bonus money for you, not an opportunity to gauge your sister and BIL.", "YTA.\nFunny enough a family member needs to be paid to watch niece/ nephew. At least where I live It would be.\nPlus babysitters get paid hourly in that case, but would offer a flat fee for longer periods of time.\nYou also state that you have scarce experience with kids. Why should they pay like a professional one?", "YTA. I built up a lot of free babysitting for my kids by babysitting my nieces and nephews before I had kids for free. These aren't random kids, they are your family. You should have done it for free or the cost of food. By throwing out a higher dollar amount when it's too late to cancel the trip, you are extorting them. Call them, say you are sorry, and the $750 is generous enough. \n\nOtherwise, your BIL was absolutely right.", "YTA\n\nYour brother in law is correct, you are an extortionist. You agreed to terms. Then held them over a barrel. Don't ask for favors, ever.", "YTA - Not everything is about money in this world. Even If your sister and BIL were millionaires, and you work as a kindergarten-teacher, you still show up to help family. \n\nI believe you are creating a toxic atmosphere when it comes to helping eachother in the family. Let\u2019s say you need help to carry a large cupboard up the stairs. I assume you will pay your BIL or another friend the same rate as proffesional help?\n\nRemember: being paid 250 $ extra have a cost, and that is your relationship with your family, and you can\u2019t pay those 250 $ back in the future with interests to get a better relationship with them.", "YTA. You sound money hungry and are just extorting your own family after you've made a commitment to them. \n\n> if he keeps that attitude up, I'll demand another thousand.\n\nWhen it is your attitude that is the problem. Bravo!", "Geez.  YTA\n\nAfter that, I'd be trying to find another babysitter and willing to pay them double just to avoid leaving my kids with you.  I'm feeling pretty grateful for my in-laws right now.", "YTA, a huge selfish AH. \n\nIf you want to be involved with their lives at all in the future, you'd better rescind your demand and apologize. What a horrible thing to do, family or not.", "Agreeing to something and then changing terms when it's too late for them to find an alternative is 100% extortion. \nYTA", "YTA and a horrible sister/aunt I can\u2019t believe they are still leaving you alone with their children?", "YTA I have never in 9 years charged my sister for babysitting her kids, even when it\u2019s across multiple days. You know why? Because family. $750 a week, plus food, when you are working most of that time anyway, was very generous. You are just being greedy.", "YTA. \n\nYou already agreed to and were happy with the $750. You could have looked up hourly rates and figured out what to charge YOURSELF. \n\nI used to babysit a pair of twins before and after school. Before agreeing to the job, I looked up the going daycare rates in my area and based what I charged on that. It's not hard to figure out. \n\nAt this point, your brother and his wife had already budgeted and made commitments based on what you agreed to. Going back on your word to demand more money is greedy and puts them in a tough spot. And, yes, they will remember this if you ever ask them for a favor.", "YTA. And I\u2019ve seen a lot of stories from your BIL and sister\u2019s perspective where someone they knew tried to take advantage of a situation because they were desperate and when it was the person\u2019s turn to ask for a favor they remembered and either pulled the same thing or didn\u2019t do shit. \n\nThing is, you can never tell when something like this could happen to you. You could be driving home in the night and your car breaks down and you want help, you could have an emergency and need support and you have no help because you burned bridges over a couple extra hundreds. Sometimes the money isn\u2019t worth it. \n\nGood luck.", "YTA\n\nfor sure\n\nin the future you could change your rate but you are def TA for changing what you agreed to.", "YTA, love Karma", "Yta. Your brother in law is right.", "Um \u2026 yeah, that\u2019s full on extortion.\n\nHuge YTA.", "I hope you desperately desperately need their help soon and they tell you to F off BIL is 1000% right you are horrible. YTA", "You are a little bit of an asshole. The reason is tact. You could of used some. For all of those saying it is just watching children, it is cooking two meals, packing lunches, driving them to and from school or getting them on the bus on time. Then after school it is homework, cleaning up after the kids, bath time and bedtime. Conservatively that is two hours in the morning and five in the afternoon. So that is 7 hours aday for a week. Even at $1000 that is only 142.87 per day. They want her to do it for 107.14 per day. It don\u2019t matter that she already has a job, it is the principle. It is just like paying your own kid $20 to mow the yard but giving the kid next door $30 to do the same job", "NTA! As a parent of three kids, I completely agree with you. Plus, they\u2019re just teaching their kids that family can be taken advantage of!!!", "NTA for wanting more money. BIL is an AH for openly discussing how much he pays his sitters in front of people, then being shocked that you want equal pay. \nYou could have handled the conversation better, but his name calling is childish.", "YTA.

You said they paid the babysitter $100 for 4 hours when the kids may only be home and awake maybe 4 hours ish before bed so realistically it\u2019s basically the same. You 100% are TA you\u2019re not missing out on anything you\u2019re just feeling awfully entitled and taking advantage of your sister", "YTA. It's your fault for not researching what a live-in baby/pet sitter makes and negotiating beforehand. You don't make an agreement and then back out at the last second, especially when you could essentially be ruining their entire trip.", "YTA. I hope you don\u2019t ever have to ask them for help in the future.", "Did you or did you not agree to the original deal?  THAT should pretty much answer the question AH.", "YTA", "YTA & are going to lose access to your family if you keep this petty ass game up.

Wow", "YTA - you agreed to $750 for the week.  Demanding more money last minute was a huge AH thing to do.  You did extort them knowing it was too late to find another sitter.  I know if I were them, I would never do a  you a favor in the future after what you did.  A random babysitter for a date night is not the same as for a family member watching the kids for a week.

No matter how you try and frame this as extortionate nobody\u2019s buying it or the warped logic you\u2019re pushing. \n\nI hope he meant what he said to you and when you are in need and they could easily help they make your life really difficult. let\u2019s hope the 1000$ is worth the tainted picture your Bil has of you now.", "YTA - you made an agreement already with them. Just because you didnt charge them enough, you cannot go back and punish them for it. I would say do this one time and then going forward, you talk about a rate.", "YTA\n\nYou're pulling a bait and switch on them after a deal you thought was fair was done.\n\nI'd have probably filed away the information for next time they needed you personally.", "YTA \n\n750 PLUS Your regular income. Are you only after money?", "YTA. First of all you didn\u2019t feel taken advantage of until you heard what they paid their babysitter. It was wrong of you to change the agreement a week before they were supposed to leave. You knew it was too late for them to get another sitter so you took advantage of the situation. Second, you were getting 750 plus a weeks worth of food. So if you add the ads pay plus the cost of groceries you were actually getting about $850. That\u2019s more than fair. If their sitter gets paid $25 an hour she probably has some sort of expertise that makes her worth the money.

They leave this coming Saturday and come back the following Saturday.  Months ago, when they were first planning this trip, my sister asked me (29F) if I would be willing to stay at their house and watch their 2 kids (8 & 6) and their dog while they are gone.  \n\nI can work from home, so I would still be able to work from their place.  And their kids are in school during the day so I would have time to get all my work done before they get home.  My sister said they can also pay me $750 for the week and will have the fridge and pantry stocked with food so that I don't have to worry about any of that either.  I was a little hesitant about it because I've never watched kids for that long before, but I did end up agreeing.\n\nAt our family Thanksgiving last week, my BIL was talking about a date that he and my sister recently went on and how expensive it was to find a good babysitter.  He said they found one they really like who is great with their kids, so they have no problem paying her $25/hour because they trust her and the kids like her.  \n\nI did some quick math in my head and realized that they were only paying me like $100 A DAY when I'm going to be in charge of their kids for an entire week.  My BIL was shelling out $100 to their babysitter for a 4-hour dinner and movie date.  \n\nI made a comment that if they can afford to pay a babysitter that much for a few hours, they should be paying me the same rate when I'm watching their kids.  My BIL at first kind of laughed it off, but I told him I was serious and if he wants me to watch his kids for an entire week, I want the same rate as they would pay their regular babysitter.  \n\nHe told me that we had already agreed on the terms of me watching their kids, but I told him that I want to change those terms, or I am not going to watch them and they'll have to find someone else.  He got pissed and called my sister over.  He explained what was happening and my sister got pissed at me too.  She said we had already agreed and since the kids will be in school and I can still work, it's not like I'm missing out on income and am also saving on food for the week.  \n\nI stood firm and told them that unless they increase what they are paying me, I am backing out of our arrangement.  There was some back and forth, but my sister eventually agreed to pay me $1000 instead of the $750.  \n\nRight after that, my BIL grabbed their kids and they left.  He walked past me on their way out and said \"You better hope you don't need to ask us for anything anytime soon you f#\\*&ing extortionist b!tch.\"  I told him if he keeps that attitude up, I'll demand another thousand.  \n\nAfter they left my mom and dad were also pissed at me.  They said that I was wrong to force my sister and BIL into that and that isn't the way we treat family.  I told them that I wasn't going to allow myself to be taken advantage of just because we share DNA.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Until I know more, I'll reserve judgment.", "What qualifications do you even have?", "YTA. You had an agreement, you know they can't get any refunds for travel at this point, and you backed them into a corner at the last minute. It was either agree to your demands, or cancel the trip and forfeit everything they had paid. You're an AH to put them in that situation.", "YTA for the reasons listed in other threads but also maybe you should consider yourself lucky to get to spend a week with your niblings and have quality time with them while they\u2019re still young. You\u2019ll look back on that week decades from now and be thankful you got to spend quality time with them and not give a shit about the money.", "Definitely YTA.", "YTA\n\nFrom a family perspective, you promised your sister you would do it for that amount.\n\nFrom a business perspective, you made a commitment at a given price. The fact that you neglected to research the usual prices is on you!\n\nYTA twice!", "YTA you agreed to $750 for the week. Trying to change the terms of the agreement a week before their vacation is really shady. They either have to cancel the vacation or pay you more. You don\u2019t treat family or anyone you care about like that. Let\u2019s hope you never need help from your family.", "YTA, for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst off, you *did* in fact agree to the rate and duration. Imagine-if you did *not* ever hear about what they were paying the babysitter, would you have been satisfied with the $750 for the week? You're not being \"taken advantage of\"--you're showing a pernicious avarice streak instead.\n\nSecond, reneging on the deal is a character flaw--it wasn't like you were forced to say yes--you negotiated and agreed. Pulling out this late in the game is inconsiderate.\n\nThirdly, the $25/hour (for two kids) is only for four hours, the average length of their date. Unless they went on dates every day, *you* are costing them *way* more than the babysitter does--so you're coming out ahead, to the tune of $650 more dollars for the week.\n\nNo one else is TA here, even with BiL's comment to you...because he told the truth.", "YTA, 1-2 hour in the mornings, 4-5 at night? the rest they are asleep or at school. If you didnt want to do it, then you should have said no from the beginning.

And they agreed to pay you $750? Wow what\u2019s their number I agree to those terms and will be happy to watch their kids and the dog. How selfish can you be? A babysitter watches the kids most of the time. Yes sometimes parents are out later than bedtime but then that babysitter puts the kids to bed, something you will do then you will once again have the time to yourself. Are you expecting 7 days 24 hours at $25 and hour? I think $750 is amazing and you\u2019re lucky they even agreed to more. Seriously selfish!!!!\n\nYTA!", "YTA because you have no problems taking advantage of them.", "You\u2019re truly evil,\u2018your brother is right, you better not ask him for anything in the future.

Free food and only the evenings with the kids.\nThere are no toddler - when I see this right - and it would be even some quality time to bond and to have fun with them.\n\nSpending time with family members and getting payed for it.\n\nWell, I kind of hope your sister has the money for a 'real' babysitter, who will have a blast!", "YTA. Please ask them to DM me. I\u2019d be THRILLED to work my normal job, plus get paid to look after their kids and pup at night for a week for $750.

Did you expect them to pay you $4k to be with your own niece and nephew for a week?  As others have said they have school during the day, and then will be sleeping presumably.  Even nannies who go on vacation generally agree to a flat rate over their regular hourly as they are not on duty the entire time.  You also are saving on food costs that week.

You had a deal and then you tried to renege because you saw dollar signs and you were extremely rude about it because you knew you were threatening the loss of their vacation and you could be.  \n\nBut the thing you're missing is that if they hired another person to do this, chances are good that they wouldn't have paid them more than they've offered you.  Or not much more.  And the truth is that no one would have been paid as much as you demanded because it would likely have made their trip too expensive and therefore impossible.  \n\nYour idea that they can afford it is very naive.  They can afford to pay someone $25/hour for 2-3 hours every once in a while.  They cannot afford to pay someone $25/hour for 168 hours.  No one gets $4200 a week babysitting.  The rates are different for live-in nannies and au pairs because room-and-board is part of the deal.  Also, you wouldn't be watching them for the whole time, as they would be in school.  \n\nSo, yeah, all around, you're being a greedy asshole.", "YTA, and to be quite honest, sounds like you might also be a shitty Uncle.

This is gross behaviour.", "YTA - for all the reasons everyone else has said, but.. \n\nYou're old enough, frankly, to not be charging them and instead just having some fun auntie time. I'm kind of sad for you and their kids that this is a \"job\" situation instead of a family situation.", "Wow. YTA  and a big one at that. You should have said no in the first place. They are making sure you're stocked on food and paying you. That's more that most would do for family or friends. They'd expect you to just do it for free.

You don't deserve it.", "Info: have any of y\u2019all here ever had to pay for overnight care from a nanny or babysitter? Because you DO have to pay even when the kids are sleeping because the person is effectively on call during the night. \n\nI have had to pay, as a single working mom, when I travel for work. It is RARELY $100/night for just the overnights, much less the actual daytime hours, too. Night rate is sometimes half the day rate, but not always. \n\nThe OP could have handled this better by doing some research before agreeing to watch the kids for the price. Or she could suck it up and negotiate differently for the next time.", "[deleted]", ">I told them that I wasn't going to allow myself to be taken advantage of just because we share DNA.\n\nYou're not being taken advantage of. You're a subpar fit for a babysitter that was doing a FAVOUR for your family.

The only good outcome from this is that you go no contact so they never have to suffer from interactions with you again.\n\nYTA.", "YTA BIG time.\n\nFirst of all, they are still paying you and they are your family.\n\nSecond, they might as well get the babysitter that at least is QUALIFIED to babysit for those rates. She at least knows how to look after kids and is good with them.\n\nAnd third, you are indeed greedy and an extortionist. You already have a job an income\u2026babysitters don\u2019t.

PLUS, she is giving up her social life during this time. Her sis and BIL knew they were getting a bargain for 750.00 - 100.00 a day is a steal.  Sis went easy with a minor boost of 1000.00 a week.  I don\u2019t think they were REALLT angry, they were happy she didn\u2019t ask for more cuz she is within her right.

Also babysitters technically are supposed to claim their income and pay taxes. As this is her sister she can easily claim it is a gift and pay no taxes.

Please also remember that most people who would watch the kids for a week would typically not change the $25/hr but would probably have a daily base rate.

I know nannies often have a lot of education and certifications like you do, but am unaware about the background checks. My daughter will likely need to hire someone to watch her child after she gets off maternity leave next summer and it looks like a lot may have happened as far as certifications and background checks in the babysitting world in the last 4 years.

I do recommend being careful when using sites like that because I have heard horror stories from both sides. I eventually applied to a nanny service. They help do the background checks and vet the nannies before connecting them to families, definitely a safer option for both sides. I had a resume that included all my credentials and a cover letter. You usually get what you pay for. Expensive child care usually means you will get someone good and qualified with years of experience. I worked up to charging a lot.

Theyre usually cheaper than a nursery but not always and they don't have things like a proper chef or usually all the same resources but they tend to have less kids and do more trips out. Childminders tend to cover all day for young kids and then they do wraparound care as well so before and after school. A lot of childminders will also babysit for the kids that they childmind for. \n\nNannies tend to be working in the family home, sometimes live in but not always and they are usually but not always found through an agency.
