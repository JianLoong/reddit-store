Some examples include, grandmother, aunts, and cousins going out to breakfast, lunches, and dinners and posting on Facebook, \"the (last name) girls\" with pictures. It did not bother me at first. But then it kept happening and we were never included. When asked at the time why my sister (16) and I (19) were not included, it was stated that we were too young or \"just kids\". My sister and I are now 23 and 26 and it still occurs. A lot of times, information is given to my mom but not passed to my dad, sister or I. Sometimes she forgets and other times she assumes we don\u2019t want to go (which is not always the case). My dad has reached out to my mom\u2019s family numerous times asking to pass info onto him because my mom will not. But that request was ignored. When my sister or I get upset when we find out about events after the fact, my mom will say that we are just starting drama.\n\nThe most current event was not being included in a small Halloween event at my grandparent\u2019s house. My sister found out about it 3 days beforehand from my cousin. My cousin assumed we had known about it. She is usually the one who will mention events thinking we knew. My sister told me and then I confronted my mom about it in our group chat with my mom, dad, sister and I. I am open with her about this ongoing issue. My mom is in denial of this issue, but my dad who is married into the family sees the issue clearly. I got a text back saying there is \"no formal invitation\" and not to be upset about it. I was told to move on. \n\nI thought that was the end of it but a week later I got a phone call from my mom who talked to my aunt about the issue. I was told my aunt said I was \"too sensitive\" and I needed to get over it. There was no \"formal invitation\" so I didn't need to start any drama about it. I kept stressing I didn't need a formal invite but passing the word would've been nice. I also stated that I didn't like finding out from another family member who was surprised I didn't know. I also asked how I was supposed to go to events if I didn't get information passed to me. But I got no answer. I texted my parents in confidence. I didn't contact other family members about it because I trusted the information with my mom. I didn't think the information would've been spread. I'm just sick of being an afterthought to my family as if I'm not considered one of them.

The situation will never change abd you'll have to accept that your mother and her family do not want you two at family gatherings.  It's real shi**y of your mom but it is what it is.  You deserve better.  Start your own get together and create your own memories.", "NTA but it appears the issue is mom, not the other family members. Mom fails to pass down the information when given to her. It's not uncommon for family members to pass Info  down through their blood and the parent, not the parent by marriage.", "Huh...if there's no \"formal invitation\"  are you supposed to just show up when you do find out?  Your mom and her family are the problem.  If other people can see it happening then they are doing it on purpose.  If it's that important to you then go ahead and confront them again and again but it's been happening for years.  Do you really want to be around people like that? NTA", "INFO: As you and your sister are now well into adulthood, why aren't you both members of whatever group chat or email group that's getting all these news and events? Mom's a problem. But she can easily be bypassed.", "NTA.  I feel for you!  I have a similar situation in my family.  I am the youngest, and my three older siblings were closer in age, and thick as thieves.  I'm the outcast in their world, but, eh...it's their loss, as I am the coolest one there is!  I found out that my sister became a grandmother about a month ago, after I read it on Facebook!!!  SERIOUSLY???!!!  I didn't send a congratulations card.  LOL\n\nI am so sorry that you have insensitive relatives, too.  It's not you or your sister.....it's your family members who are missing a sensitivity chip, somewhere.\n\nI hope you will continue being very honest with your relatives about how hurtful their behavior is, because it's NOT okay.  You may never be able to change them, but you are definitely entitled to let them know how this makes you feel.  I think that is part of the problem......people like our relatives seem to lack the ability to see life situations like this through the eyes of anyone but themselves.", "NTA- from now on do things only with your dad and your sister; put it on Facebook and see how your mom feels then.", "NTA\n\nHonestly it feels like they don\u2019t consider you part of the family.  I think it\u2019s time to let them go, if they don\u2019t want you, then you don\u2019t want them type of things.  From now on make plans to spend you time with your sister and your friends.  Remember you only have so much time in this earth, do you really want to spend it with people who clearly don\u2019t want you around.  \n\n\u201cThe bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life.\u201d ~Richard Bach", "NTA\n\nYou ARE being excluded and for your mom to not care she KNOWINGLY allows it. \n\nStep back and make them come to you from now on if it's really important to have them in your life. In all honesty you would probably be better off without their toxicity and negativity.\n\n Have activities with just you and your sister from here on out then post about all the fun you are having.", "NTA. imho, Whatever her reasons, your mom is gatekeeping and keeping you and your sister away from her family of origin.  It sounds like you have talked with these relatives and most of them don\u2019t feel like going the extra step of letting you know about events. It hurts to be rejected but me, I\u2019d let those relatives eff off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I like the sound of making my own memories. I never thought of it that way but it is a positive way of looking at it.", "Yes - call the cousin who was surprised you did not know and make some FABULOUS plans.  Invite a second cousin and keep doing things with them.  Anyone who says you are too sensitive does not get an invite.", "Basically my aunt said, if I hear of it from someone else, just go and not make a big deal about it.", "I know my mom and her siblings have a group chat. I am not sure if there is another one with more people aside from my sister and I. They are old fashioned and pass off information by word of mouth. My dad, sister and I have asking my moms family to tell us instead because the info does not get to us. There's not much else I can think of to my bypass my mom. I am open to other ideas though!", "I am sorry that happened to you! I hate finding things about like that through social media.\n\nWith my family, I feel like I will always be in the wrong for how I feel. They don't see me actually being affected. They see me being upset as starting drama. It's unfortunate but right now I am going to work on creating healthy boundaries and making my own memories like one of the comments above said. It's a sad situation that I am unable to control. I can't make them see the issue in any other way ):", "Absolutely.  And going forward, put your mother on an information diet.  She doesn\u2019t see fit to tell you about family events, she doesn\u2019t deserve to know what\u2019s going on in your life.  So if she asks, just say:  \u201c You know.  Same old same old.\u201d", "Info: did your aunt say that to you or was it relayed by your mother? From your explanation, it sounds to me like mom is putting words in you/sister and family\u2019s mouths. Like her perception is that you are in the wrong because you are stating how you feel about it, but she\u2019s not seeing how you feel or what are outside factors into feeling like you are.\n\nTo me, it seems like she is relaying everything to both sides; so your aunt may perceive you as being in the wrong, but really your mom may not be telling her how she doesn\u2019t bother to inform you about it. I would honestly consider telling your cousin that you\u2019re friendly with that you want to come to these things but your mom will not tell you about them. Then ask if she wouldn\u2019t mind just telling you when they get planned.", "Are the events ever only planned by your mom's generation? What about cousins? Do cousins not have a say in these plans? That's weird. \n\nSounds funny that plans are only made in person. Means you have to meet up to discuss stuff. What if plans change last minute? You still need to call each other up to discuss that. I think you should start a group with the cousins. Then if the older generation wants to give input, then add them. \n\nStart your own celebrations.", "That\u2019s right OP! Go make your own memories! \nYour sister and your cousins can go do your own things and meet up at restaurants, girls\u2019 night, picnic at a park, bar night, board game night, movie night etc. No need to invite the older generation if they want to do their own thing. You younger ladies in your 20s go live your life. They can go on an information diet. Also, friends can become family. Branch out. \n\nGood luck Op!", "I've had a talk with my aunt a year ago and she basically told me not get worked up about these things. She denied that my sister or I was being excluded. But my dad was with my mom when my aunt said that I was too sensitive. I was not with them. So I was relayed the conversation.\n\nMy mom always goes to my aunt for everything. She will tell her things that should stay between our household. For example, the text I sent my parents. So going forward I will be careful with what I say because I now know it'll be passed on.\n\nAs for my cousin, we've talked about that too. I asked her to pass on that information because my mom won't tell us. But she really hasn't since we talked.", "So if one of my cousins plan things, they will send a group chat or post it on our family Facebook group. That goes for me too when I plan events.\n\nBut with the aunts/uncles, they don't really post things unless it's a big event like Xmas, Thanksgiving, or Easter. I guess Halloween does not fall into that category. This time, they told me it was a last minute thing and it was just whoever knows can come. But my mom should be passing the information on. I confronted her so I didn't get to see if she was actually going to tell us or not. I think the events get planned in a sibling group chat between my mom and her siblings but I am not positive.", "Well then that tells you all that you need to know. You told your cousin that you aren't being told and when she finds out to pass it on but hasn't. That means that it is intentional for whatever reason. You mom is being a pretty crap parent for this as she and her family are intentionally leaving you guys out. Start you own get togethers with friends or other family that are being left out. And maybe put your mom on a information diet so she's not in the know anymore and gets to know how it feels to be left out.", "I kind of wouldn't be surprised if what your aunt said and what your mom told you your aunt said are totally different things. My MIL is like that. She delights in causing havoc and turning people against each other. I would either speak with the aunt directly, or, probably preferable, just forget the lot of them. Do you really want the drama and headaches?"]}
