I never really thought it was that big of a deal since my manager or shift leads haven\u2019t made any complaints about how I tie my apron so I didn\u2019t think anything of it until some people had made comments saying how dangerous it was and it could get caught on things, which I completely understand and had taken into consideration but have explain that everything that it could get caught on is either to high or pushed to far back against the walls to get caught and I\u2019d have to be extremely close to things for it to get caught. I had also explained that I will not tie my apron in the back as I\u2019m very picky with where it sits how it looks ect and my managers and shift leads have no problem with the way I tie it, these ppl have called me stubborn and unreasonable for refusing to tie my apron in the back. I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue as it is MY apron and my shifts and manger doesn\u2019t have an issue with it.

There's nothing wrong with it except that someone feels their way is the only way and everyone else should do it that way.", "NTA.\n\nTheir position is technically correct, it\u2019s a health-safety issue in that front ties are a lot easier to get caught on things, dip in food or drinks, catch fire, etc.  Your managers probably should require aprons to be tied in the back.\n\nWe always say accidents never happen until one does. \n\nThat said: It *is* pretty rare for something like that to actually occur, and your coworkers shouldn\u2019t be on your ass about this \u2014 they certainly shouldn\u2019t be calling you names.  That\u2019s rude and unwarranted.  Your managers should be enforcing those things, and if they\u2019re not then the coworkers should raise concerns with them.", "NTA. Unless your workplace (or manager) has a distinct policy that outlines how the apron is to be worn, including how its tied, I don't see how tying in front is any less safe than tying in the back. In fact, it seems if you've got a smaller frame, wrapping it around your waist a second time helps reduce the length of the tie-off fabric, ensuring less is hanging loose.", "I do have the knot under my apron most times but other times I forget and the one time I forget I have ppl complaining about it no coworkers or\nManagers just random people who don\u2019t work at Starbucks I never had any issues with my apron getting caught things when it isn\u2019t under my apron but most times I keep the knot under my apron", "Yep I have checked the rules as well haven\u2019t seen anything that says we aren\u2019t allowed to tie in front I always make sure when I\u2019m tying my apron I don\u2019t have any hanging strings so it doesn\u2019t cause any issues", "I never seen an issue with it either since non of my coworkers or manger hasn\u2019t said anything about it and then ppl started complaining bc I don\u2019t tie it in the back", "I\u2019m a bit on the chubby side so I typically just double knot and keep the knot under my apron and there is never any hanging strings my store doesn\u2019t have any policy on how aprons are worn so I never saw an issue"]}
