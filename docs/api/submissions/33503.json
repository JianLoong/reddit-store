It might give you some clarity.", "NTA.  She sounds very high maintenance.  I mean, You had a rough day, so you are wearing a hat.  I don't love it when my husband dresses in certain ways, but he is an adult and fully capable of dressing himself.  If he likes it, then SO BE IT.  Maybe blowing up at her is not great, but you were already at a hightened emotional state.", "NTA - your girlfriend seems too pre-occupied with herself.\n\nIf this is the way she is when you're at a low point...

NTA", "NTA. You called out her insensitivity and instead of being an adult and acknowledging + apologizing for it, she's flipping it around to make you the bad guy", "NTA, part of being in a relationship is having an understanding of when to be kind and provide extra support.  Think if the roles reversed would you treat her like that if she was going through a similar situation? That should give you all the clarity you need on this.", "GF is not a nice person! She is telling you what to wear knowing you don't like it. You need a better GF. NTA - she was pushing buttons and looking for an argument", "NTA your gf doesn't give a shit about you or about your dog that died. She only cares about herself and it's clear. Also if there is always a \"you have ruined... \" Sentence in a relationship that relationship is sinking. I feel for you I know loosing a pet hurts like hell. More power to you and your dog was really lucky that it had someone that loved him/herso much.", "Dude\u2026Is she always so critical of you?  If so, why do you subject yourself to that?  Take a break and do some soul searching about what you really want in life.  Do you want to be nitpicked to death hours after your companion died or someone who accepts you and brings you peace?  Choose wisely.", "NTA Looking back in hindsight, it would have been better if you had calmly but firmly told your girlfriend what you said instead, but she had been jabbing away at you even knowing you must be raw because of your grief -- and then proceeded to play the same silly game of claiming you \"ruined\" something -- in this case *by you reminding her your dog died*.\n\nI think you blowing up by yelling that one sentence was understandable if regrettable. She was pushing you and playing drama games when you were in a vulnerable emotional state. It was cruel. Your reaction wasn't optimal, but you got out of the car straight away and stopped.\n\nI would have a hard think about what kind of person she is. She seems to not be there for you even in cases of death and grief and instead just keeps on with the same petty pecks at you and playing the victim she might do on any other day. That's cold.", "Red flags. She\u2019s ALWAYS gonna be like this bill never be about you, SHE is the main character", "NTA.

From what you have said it seems like your GF is pretty dismissive about your feelings. And telling you that  you ruin things is conditioning.
