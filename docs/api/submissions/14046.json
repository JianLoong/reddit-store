We've never lived together, we were 20 and 21 back then. \nIt's been almost 3 years since, I moved to the other side of the country to continue my study and mostly to get away from everything.\nSince then, she's texted me almost everyday, asking if I had deleted her photos or not. Which I assured I had on the day of our breakup. \nYes some of those were sensitive, and yes I've deleted it all. She won't take my word for it. My life for the past few months has been brought down to a living hell. Where I've become her emotional punching bag of sorts. Whatever anxiety and other problems she's been facing has been blamed on me. I've kept my distance from her since. \nShe threatens to get her parents involved for some reason who are abusive and have tried to harm me in the past. Also one of the points to mention is that she was manipulative and would shut me out whenever things did not get her way. \nI've blocked her from everywhere, when she texted me from her new boyfriend's account. She got herself a boyfriend 3 days after we broke up, this is not the same guy however. Plus asked the same dude to call me up and kinda yell at me when I stopped responding. \nIt's draining me pretty bad. \nI've been accused of having cheated on her, when she stopped me from being friends with most people. When said cheating... It would mean to hug or be in the vicinity of anyone. It's been going on for a while. I've had my exams recently when I told her I can't talk much during this time, which was disregarded as any of my boundaries. It's a weird situation which has drained me a lot.

Unfortunately, I can tell you right now the police won't do dick all unless she physically comes at you with a weapon. What you need is to find a lawyer who will work with you for cheap or free to send her a cease & desist, with threat of further legal action if she and her friends continue. This is how I got my stalker to back off. But it's important that you DO NOT reply to her for any reason. Let legal representation do that for you. Block her on every number and account she tries to contact you on, and forward those numbers and names to your lawyer, as well as reporting her usernames to any platform such as Instagram that she's using to harass you.\n\nGood luck, my friend. Hopefully she'll back off soon. Remember: this is not your fault.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. This is harassment, keep a record of it and report her. Also change your number for the sake of your mental health.", "NTA She sounds like an emotional vampire. Ugh... You broke up a few years ago. My concern is  why are you still entertaining or responding to her? Any reaction you give her only encourages her more because she receives a response from you. Cut her out of your life. Eventually, she'll obsess over someone else.", "NTA. I admire your compassion, trying to be there for her even when you\u2019ve been broken up for years. But this is very unhealthy. She is still clinging to you 3 yrs later, and doesn\u2019t seem to understand the nature of blocking. \n\nA block is a louder action that says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you\u201d. Did she take each block as a challenge? Did she comprehend your casual contact with her, as a deeper soul connection this entire time? She\u2019s living in her own fantasy world, and for some reason, blocks and a solid, \u201cI can\u2019t talk\u201d aren\u2019t bringing her back to reality. \n\nI would take advice from other comments. Get legal involved, and screenshot everything. This is harassment, which could turn into something far more dangerous later on (such as defamation, in-person stalking etc). She sounds unstable, controlling, and out of tune with reality.", "Nta but honestly grow a pair...\nStop talking to her. And stand up for yourself!", "NTA and she is stalking you. I\u2019d consider filing for a restraining order for harassment and stalking for real. Keep documentation of all the text, emails, messages from SM, how many different numbers an sac out a you have blocked, and of course stay NC contact with her or anyone associated with her. Change your number completely, keep all SM completely private and don\u2019t engage with her. If she manages to get through with a message or call, block it immediately and hang up without saying a word. Good luck.", "OP that sounds awful! My best suggestion is to make every social media you own private so she cannot find information about you. Make a new one if necessary for only close friends you trust without any obvious links to your name. If you can change your phone number then do so, otherwise never pick up numbers that aren\u2019t in your contacts already. \n\nSame with your email. If you can change it easily, then do so. Otherwise maybe put some filters on it so any emails that have similar wording to what she sends get sorted to spam / deleted. \n\nDepending on your phone you might be able to make it that texts from unknown numbers don\u2019t notify you. Part of the challenge here isn\u2019t constantly blocking someone, but removing the anxiety that you\u2019ll be contacted at any moment. \n\nWhen you go back home make sure you only tell your family that you trust so news doesn\u2019t get out. Or if you can arrange to meet them somewhere an hour out. \n\nI also recommend going to the police if you can.", "NTA\n\nI get that you've tried blocking her, but you're really not trying hard enough. The moment you hear her voice, simply hang up and block the new number. Do this every single time. Social media is dumb anyway, so take a break for a year. Or switch to anonymous accounts only.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is that you still are allowing FAR too much contact here. She cannot force you to speak to her, or listen to her. Yet she keeps talking you into having full on discussions about all her crazy bullshit. Oh, her boyfriend yelled at you? Hang up on that goober, and block him too. There is *nothing* he has to say that you need to hear. Not one damn thing. But what about her parents? Same. Don't care. None of them get another second of your time. No exceptions. She's screaming? Hang up. She's sobbing? Hang up. She tells you someone important died? You guessed it: Hang the fuck up. You keep giving her something to work with by reacting in any way. You keep getting sucked in. You keep somehow giving a fuck what she has to say. Stop it.", "NTA, gather evidence and file a police report for harassment and get a restraining order. You are not responsible for her mental health and she needs to back the hell off.", "NTA\n\nAnd dude, please get another phone number and make sure that she never gets it.\n\nIf she keeps threatening you, contact the police with evidence for a restraining order.", "NTA - stop answering numbers you don't know. Make your accounts private etc... (Opting for only friends can message you...). If someone is legit, they will let a voice message, contact you by email etc...\n\nDo not read any letter/email you know are from her/her bf etc... She'll get tired of it, but you have to be clear in your behavior as well : do not engage, hung up, don't reply...  And ofc if it gets physical (like she does to your place or her bf) call the police.", "This sounds like a police matter tbh.

I recommend to look up the Grey Rock method, maybe this works. Blocking/ignoring makes such people escalate (as witnessed here) so maybe this method will work. It is normally for dealing with, and eventually disengaging from, manipulative and abusive people especially when they are still close but the basic idea can be applied here as well.", "NTA. Block her", "NTA, but why on Earth you are even talking/texting her????? Just ignore and block every single attempt to contact you, don't entertain her. Her problems are not your problems.", "You broke up with her 3 years ago and she is still holding on.  That is her problem not yours.   \n\nKeep all her numbers blocked... But you also need to not respond at all when she contacts you from new numbers.   Never respond!!!   Don't respond to her family members either.\n\n Your responding is allowing this stalking to continue way longer.  Be strong this is not your fault.

I've told her numerous times that I have deleted every single picture which she was a part of from my gallery the day we broke up, but she's not the one to take my word for an answer, idk what else I could provide.
