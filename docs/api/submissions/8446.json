Interesting comments. A lot of think about here. Judgement accepted. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m turning 40 soon and feel some kind of way about it. I asked my person to plan my birthday because it feels really lame to throw myself a birthday party. This year my birthday falls on a Wednesday.

It very much sounds like I will just be sitting on the couch and waiting to see if anyone has time to randomly come through which just feels really sad and depressing. \n\nSo, I told my person to cancel it. They have fully skipped my birthday in the past with no celebration, gift, or even so much as going out to eat, so I was really clear that I wanted them to step up and plan something rad, but here we are. \n\nAm I the asshole? I will accept my judgement.\n\nEdit: I had a shared list with them that included birthday ideas like people to invite, fun activities, places to go, favorite foods, gift ideas, the whole thing. I also threw a big surprise bday party at our place for a close friend turning 30 back in December so my person had first hand experience with what a big birthday celebration should be. \n\nI also hear what some of you are saying about me not communicating clearly. If I wanted something, I should\u2019ve spelled it out.

Also, maybe just a generalized disappointment that they don\u2019t seem to give a shit about celebrating your bday at all (no gifts/dinner/etc).\n\nNTA for the question, because an open house style weeknight party sucks.

Given their past behavior of ignoring the day entirely, I\u2019d also say that OP communicating that they wanted a party was clearly a statement of \u201cI want you to DO SOMETHING\u201d for the day. If you\u2019re married for someone to years, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect them to get that without a diagram, especially since OP provided a list of things that they would like! If OP sat down with any more exact specifics they might as well plan the whole thing themselves. \n\nI think you need a frank conversation about how your partners unwillingness to make an effort has hurt you.

The fact they chose the actual day when people would most likely not be able to attend due to work vs when people could, speaks volumes .", "The comments telling you that you aren't communicating properly are BS imo. It cannot always fall on the underappreciated person (aka often women, although you didn't mention gender) to \"spell something out\" because it puts even more responsibility on them when their partner (aka often men) should be held to a higher standard instead. It's really not hard to be considerate and put in effort into your partner's big day. This is simple, does not require mindreading because birthday celebrations are already a societal standard and do not need to be told, and people shouldn't make you feel guilty for not \"being more clear\". It's like saying one partner \"needs to communicate\" to the other that dishes must be washed; that is an unacceptably low bar for the lazy ass partner who shouldn't need to be told.

I get there are different types of folks but after your partner mentions it once it\u2019s already time to step up.", "The hubs didn't plan it at all. \n\n\"Come by on Wednesday if you feel like it\" isn't a plan.", "\"Your partner doesn't care about your birthday, suck it up buttercup\"", "Yeah I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s sad to throw yourself a party at all, I\u2019m 23 and since my 20th I\u2019ve opted for a party rather than a night out and I\u2019ve always planned it myself even after getting in a relationship, that way I can invite who I want and set the vibe for it all. Nothing wrong with it at all", "Yes how unreasonable of OP to expect their life partner to do something thoughtful for a major milestone.", "Miserable living indeed.", "I like celebrating my friends' birthdays, because I like celebrating my friends. \n\nSure, it needs to stay within reason, I'm not going to Vegas or doing a \"birthday month.\" \n\nBut I'm happy to drop in and wish someone well. Plus, I like cake.", "This is a long term relationship, they seem to have been through many birthdays together.\n\nOP still chooses to be with them, they've made their choice. No point trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.\n\nThe amount of people on here that whine about partners that they chose and continue to choose is astounding.\n\nYou want a kind considerate partner who makes an effort for your birthday? Then date one.\n\nDo not date a person who doesn't care about your birthday and repeatedly shows it and then complain about it."]}
