I think it\u2019s a communication issue on both our parts and love language issue. They were extremely apologetic and genuinely felt bad when looking at it from the other perspective. They reached out to my friend and are planning something together. I\u2019m hindsight, I wish I hadn\u2019t posted here because my person might see it. But I\u2019m also glad I posted because there were some great insights here that were tremendously helpful. Thanks reddit. \n\n\nJUDGEMENT:sounds like I\u2019m the asshole here with a sprinkling of my partner being a bit of a Turd Ferguson as well. Interesting comments. A lot of think about here. Judgement accepted.  \n\nJudgement EDIT: now it seems more people are saying I\u2019m less of the asshole and my partner is more so. I do think I have some blame here in that I should\u2019ve communicated my expectations more clearly or partnered them up with some friends to help plan. I can\u2019t go back and change that now, but I will be speaking with my person tonight and expressing my feelings about the lack of effort. I do take comfort in knowing I wasn\u2019t the asshole for asking them to cancel the open house midweek birthday party. It sounds miserable and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not alone in that thought. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m turning 40 soon and feel some kind of way about it. I asked my person to plan my birthday because it feels really lame to throw myself a birthday party. This year my birthday falls on a Wednesday. Instead of having a party the weekend before or after, they put out a message telling people to swing by and say hi Wednesday evening, Open House style. \n\nPeople don\u2019t want to get home from work, leave their house again, and go say hi to someone on a Wednesday evening in the middle of winter. It very much sounds like I will just be sitting on the couch and waiting to see if anyone has time to randomly come through which just feels really sad and depressing. \n\nSo, I told my person to cancel it. They have fully skipped my birthday in the past with no celebration, gift, or even so much as going out to eat, so I was really clear that I wanted them to step up and plan something rad, but here we are. \n\nAm I the asshole? I will accept my judgement.\n\nEdit: I had a shared list with them that included birthday ideas like people to invite, fun activities, places to go, favorite foods, gift ideas, the whole thing. I also threw a big surprise bday party at our place for a close friend turning 30 back in December so my person had first hand experience with what a big birthday celebration should be. \n\nI also hear what some of you are saying about me not communicating clearly. If I wanted something, I should\u2019ve spelled it out. After a lengthy marriage, I was hoping that they would know me well enough to be able to plan something like this, but they are also not a mind reader or a professional party planner.", "created_utc": 1674845781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mss0v/aita_for_asking_my_spouse_to_plan_my_40th_bday/", "score": 1319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So I feel like this isn\u2019t about the party, it\u2019s their lack of doing what you wanted them to do, and them not realizing how important it was for you. Also, maybe just a generalized disappointment that they don\u2019t seem to give a shit about celebrating your bday at all (no gifts/dinner/etc).\n\nNTA for the question, because an open house style weeknight party sucks.

That\u2019s not a party and that doesn\u2019t take planning- that\u2019s sending out a single text message. Given their past behavior of ignoring the day entirely, I\u2019d also say that OP communicating that they wanted a party was clearly a statement of \u201cI want you to DO SOMETHING\u201d for the day. If you\u2019re married for someone to years, it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect them to get that without a diagram, especially since OP provided a list of things that they would like! If OP sat down with any more exact specifics they might as well plan the whole thing themselves. \n\nI think you need a frank conversation about how your partners unwillingness to make an effort has hurt you. This was important to you, you made it clear it was, and they either didn\u2019t listen or didn\u2019t care. That sucks.

The fact they chose the actual day when people would most likely not be able to attend due to work vs when people could, speaks volumes .", "The comments telling you that you aren't communicating properly are BS imo (and besides, I think you are already communicating pretty clearly). It cannot always fall on the underappreciated person (aka often women, although you didn't mention gender) to \"spell something out\" because it puts even more responsibility on them when their partner (aka often men) should be held to a higher standard instead. It's really not hard to be considerate and put in effort into your partner's big day. This is simple, does not require mindreading because birthday celebrations are already a societal standard and do not need to be told, and people shouldn't make you feel guilty for not \"being more clear\". It's like saying one partner \"needs to communicate\" to the other that dishes must be washed; that is an unacceptably low bar for the lazy ass partner who shouldn't need to be told.
