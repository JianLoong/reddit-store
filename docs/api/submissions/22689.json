She\u2019s the youngest of the family so she\u2019s naturally kind of spoiled. I can\u2019t lie, I can\u2019t help but hate her. I\u2019m 7 years older then her (23), and because of that, I had to sacrifice a huge part of my childhood to take care of her so I can\u2019t help but hate her a bit. She\u2019s prettier then me also, so everyone prefers her over me. \n\nToday was her birthday, and I didn\u2019t get her a gift. I felt no need to because I break my damn back for minimum wage, its my money, I can do what I want. I came home from work expecting her to be studying (she\u2019s taking summer school to graduate early) but she was waiting at the couch near the door. She smiled when she saw me and dragged me to the kitchen, where she had baked a cake for herself and decorated the whole kitchen. She was really excited to celebrate with her family, everyone was happy but I wasn\u2019t giving the same energy. She frowned when she saw my annoyed expression but lit the candles and we started singing happy birthday, and then my brother and mother give her gifts, and eventually everyone looks at me because I have nothing to give her. I said I didn\u2019t buy anything, and my sister frowned again. \n\nEverything went fine after that, she went back to studying and I just went on my phone. But suddenly my mom opens the door and tells me that she\u2019s disappointed in me because I never got her a gift. I explain to her that its my money and she already got some nice gifts from my brother. Then she suggests that I go take her to see the Barbie movie in a few days ( the Barbie movie is coming out by the time I post this) but I say no, because I already had plans with friends to see the movie. \n\nMy mom calls my selfish and we get into a whole shitshow, arguing, screaming and yelling. My sister had walked over to see what all the yelling was about a while ago but we both never noticed that she was listening to us. By the time my mom notices my sister watching us, she drags her to me and demands that I apologize to her, and at this point my sister is crying like a toddler. I refused to apologize and called her a spoiled brat, she ran out the room and my mom slapped me. \n\nMy Brother then yells at me, saying that the stuff I said about our sister during me and our mothers argument was rude and horrible. He said that we was a good kid, and had nothing but admiration and love for me, and that I was a horrible sister. He said that even if my salary was low, I still should of got her something because last year my sister went out of her way to buy something for me on my birthday ( some cheap skincare and makeup)\n\nNow my sister is avoiding me and my brother and mother refuse to talk to me. \n\nAm I the asshole or is my sister just spoiled and my family dramatic?", "created_utc": 1689814115, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154c9xj/aita_for_calling_my_sister_a_spoiled_brat_brat/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing says \"I'm the golden child\" like having to bake your own cake and decorate the kitchen for your own sweet 16. \n\nYou ruined a huge milestone for her, not by not buying her a gift, but by being a terrible sister and making perfectly clear how bitter and jealous of her you are at **her** damn birthday. \n\nYTA beyond belief, without a doubt, to infinity and fucking beyond. Apologize and go to therapy to work over this unhealthy resentment for things that aren't her fault.", "I think I missed the part where you described her brat traits. You don't like her because you had to babysit her and she's prettier.....yeah, what a brat. And before you concoct some fantasy details to show she's a brat, save it. If she was a brat, she would have confronted you, not your mom and brother. Jealousy is a sad thing. Get over yourself. Apologize. YTA.", "YTA. Pretty sure everyone prefers your sister to you because you\u2019re an incredibly unpleasant person. What\u2019s your deal? Why are you so miserable to everyone around you?", ">He said that we was a good kid, and had nothing but admiration and love for me, and that I was a horrible sister.\n\nYou know what OP, I'm not goona pass a judgement here.

This kid clearly looks up to YOU. After all your her big sister. She made sure to wait for YOU before doing any birthday stuff. And when you got home she made sure YOU were there when she lit her candles.\n\nShe didn't burst into tears because she's a brat, she burst into tears because YOU were upset and she knew you'd be mean to her, that's why she's avoiding you.\n\nThe cost of her gift to you last year doesn't matter, what matters to her is she put in effort and, no doubt, her own money she saved for YOU.\n\nI understand the resentment of helping raise siblings,  I did it twice and I hated my lil bros for a long time. Then I realised that like your lil sis they're not actually spoiled they're just not having to make the choices I had to.\n\nMy advice would be to have a long hard think and maybe you'll come to that realisation.\n\nRegardless of how things have been for you I hope all the best for all of you.", "You couldn't drop 10 dollars on some bath bombs for your own sister?

She made a cake, wanted to celebrate with you, and you sat there like a doom cloud.\n\nYou wanna resent someone? Resent your parents. \n\nAnd I'm pretty sure people don't prefer her over you bc of her looks.  More so bc you have a massive chip on your shoulder and let a shitty childhood be the reason you're a shitty adult.", "YTA. Even if you didn\u2019t want to spend a penny on her you made a point to bring down the mood the second you got home and saw that she was excited to celebrate with her family.

You're a grown ass working adult who has one-sided beef with a teenage girl for... existing?", "Ah yes, typical spoiled child behavior like (looks at smudged writing on hand) \u2026baking a cake by herself to share with her family.\n\nYTA. Get over yourself and take her to the Barbie movie.", "Some cheap skin care and makeup??

You don't need a lot to get someone a small gift.", "YTA. Does everyone prefer your sister or are you just completely unlikable? Because after reading this who wouldn't like your sister more?", "YTA - you are entitled brat yourself - clearly spoiled and selfish", "YTA - You didn't buy your sister a gift but you had enough money to buy tickets to a movie and the phrase \"She was naturally spoiled\" is not true at all it may seem like you kind of want to be spoiled not the other way around. Also your telling me you couldn't even buy a card?", "YTA - You are a grown ass woman who is jealous of a child being prettier than you. I\u2019ll even do you one better, I bet she has a better personality and character too. Tell her happy birthday from me!", "Geez. YTA. \n My dude. You are an ADULT acting like a spoiled teen. Yikes. Seek help and apologize to the poor girl.", "YTA. It\u2019s clear that giving individual gifts is a thing for your family, and your sister\u2014a child\u2014was able to use her limited means to get gifts for your birthday before. It sounds like you\u2019re using finances as an excuse to be cruel to your sister. \n\nAs an older sibling, I get what you\u2019re saying about unequal treatment between you and your sister. But that\u2019s on your parents, not your sister, and you absolutely *can* help but hate her. \n\nIn the future, if your main concern is actually the money, try talking to your mom/brother and see if you can go in on a gift together.", "YTA\n\nYou felt the need to state twice that you hate your sister in your first paragraph. If you were asked to look after her, then be frustrated with your Mom, not your sister.\n\nIt's pretty bratty of you not to even get her a card for her birthday. Even if it was cheap skincare that she picked out for you, she put more effort into trying to be thoughtful than you have.\n\nI will say your Mom is also an AH if she physically slapped you during the argument. She was completely out of line to do that.\n\nBut you *hating* your sister is concerning since from what you've said, she doesn't sound like a brat at all.", "YTA. It wouldn't break the bank to get some bubble bath or something. Sheesh.", "YTA. This was super sad to read. Even if you had unfair expectations placed on you by your family to care for your sister, it's not her fault. She was (and still is) a child. You're the adult.   \nIt doesn't take much to be thoughtful to family. Even a nominal gift would have been appreciated. And having that kind of blowout \\*on her birthday\\* shows that clearly the most entitled person in that story was you. Even if I had a \\*horrible\\* relationship with a member of my family, I would \\*never\\* air that out on their birthday. That was a very immature move.", "YTA! What the hell? You keep treating your sister as if she is a burden on you when she clearly wanted to celebrate (AND EVEN BAKED HER OWN BIRTHDAY CAKE!)", "YTA.\n\nYou clearly resent your sister for shit that was not her fault. Be mad at your parents for making you care for her, but that\u2019s not her fault.\n\nYour sister loves and looks up to you. She was disappointed but didn\u2019t say shit when you didn\u2019t get her a gift. The issue is that you threw a fit and berated her because your MOTHER called you out. Again, NOT YOUR SISTER.\n\nYou are an insecure bully, and it\u2019s dripping from this post", "YTA- you are 23yo jealous of a 16yo. There is something seriously wrong with you. Grow up, your sister sounds more mature than you.", "THERAPY like Yesterday. \n\nGirl get yourself some therapy because this shit is going to fester and turn you into a person *you* won't even like.\n\nYour brother told you basically that while he's loves you, you're a horrible sister and the things you said about her during the argument were disgusting. I don't even want to imagine what you said. Your brothers words really make me wonder what kind of \"help\" you really had to give, Were you raising your sister or were you just asked to babysit and because you would rather do something else you hated her for it?\n\nYour sister was not crying about not getting a gift. She sucked up her disappointment at your horrible ass attitude and didn't let it ruin her birthday. You couldn't even put on a fake smile during the \"party\"?? Anyway your sister was crying because she probably heard the nasty shit you said about her and finally realized just how much you hate her. \n\nPeople prefer her to you not because she's spoiled or \"prettier\" but because you have a very horrible and nasty attitude.

Your poor sister. She decorated the kitchen herself AND made her own birthday cake at 16. And she was so exited to show you! You could at least have given her a card.

But I still wasn't totally exempt from some hardships of my own . Later-after we were all grown, & even as Seniors -I had to beg my sisters to come care for me when recuperating from a surgery. Two sisters did finally come to my home, but , once again, due to  my still looking so youthful & doing so well, even after the surgery, they decided to ignore me instead, while just taking up a lot of drinking together . They just went ON treating me like I had no right to ask them to come care for me at home. (I was already apalled by the very idea that I even had to ASK & finally Beg them to come ? )  One sister told me \"She always hated me since the day I was born. \" . I was SO shocked ! I really never gained that impression from her the whole time we lived at home together,. She resented me because she had to care for me at times & she & my other sisters had masked many bad incidences in our parents lives-which I believe they Chose to do. But she didn't tell me any of that then -just got drunk w. my eldest sister in my house , made a raucous so I couldn't recuperate well & get any rest. They finally left my house -still drunk or hung-over -& my impression of them was forever changed.

Just like YOU-the youngest didn't ASK to be born & being of an odd # -the 7th-& coming after brothers instead of sisters -the youngest also becomes the Scapegoat in the Family .

I was so parentified as a child. I had to watch my younger siblings when I was younger and missed out on a lot of my childhood. I do resent my parents a little for putting that much pressure on me. (I was only 11 my siblings were 9,8,4) But I don\u2019t hate my siblings for it. OP is taking out her anger and resentment at her sister, which isn\u2019t fair. Talking to someone therapy would be so beneficial for her.", "Thanks, it sucks but even though the little shits don't talk to me much now they're \"all growed ups\" can't help but be proud of the little fuckers\ud83d\ude02.\n\nI will say this though, definitely prepped me for having my own kid... Kinda", "Thank you,\n\nI try. The main problem with this sub, iss people make a quick judgement say a ltlle mean/supportive comment and then get on with their day with little to no consideration that all of us here have and are the audience.\n\nIts important, in my opinion, that if you have advice to give then it should be given freely as even if an op is a complete bellend and clearly an ah, someone reading the posts might not be and the advice might help them.\n\nAnyways I'm rambling...", "Agreed. I was just thinking \"why does OP hang around the sister if she really hates her ?\". It's not a good situation to have her near the kid, so I think it would be better to find her own place and find some peace.", "Agreed because her mom seems to have put the burden of raising her child on OP.  OP has a lot of built up resentment over it.  She should move out and do her own thing.  No one can make you do anything you don't want but by you staying there..you are causing your own issues to fester.  I'd say your mom is an a**. Why is she cooking her own cake and decorating for her birthday?  It's time for you to get out into the world.", "Or just a card, being pleasant, and not calling her a spoiled brat. The bar for passable is very low.", "It does sound like she was parentified. I think that's why parentification is shitty as hell. Best case scenario, the kid who is parentified moves out and and goes low contact. Worst case scenario, the kid becomes super resentful not of their parents...but the kids they were forced to care for.\n\nDoesn't excuse her behavior, which is horrid, but I can see how it happened.", "Yes", "I know I saw the response. She just sounds a bitter and angry and Incredibly insecure. I hope she gets help", "No. That\u2019s part of the resentment, but it\u2019s literally the last thing she mentions. It\u2019s not the primary reason.", "She happily made her own birthday cake. Doesn\u2019t sound spoiled to me.", "ehh is that really parentifying?? I did (and still do) those things for my sibs.", "Amen.", ">What exactly did your sister do to you? Nothing you mentioned is directly coming from your sister. \n\n\nYesss! Excellent point!", "Exactly what I came here to say. She couldn\u2019t get a shiny new iPhone 12 when she was 13... because it hadn\u2019t come out yet!\n\nAnd the gall to say \u201call I got was a shitty iPhone 6\u201d when it was literally top of the line at the time.... sorry they didn\u2019t buy a time machine to get you technology that didn\u2019t exist yet", "this! op is such an unreliable narrator lmao", "THIS. This comment describes exactly what is happening.", "Yeah. The \u201ccheap\u201d comment, after she got her sister literally NOTHING and her sister was only 15 at the time (probably also has limited money). \n\nIt\u2019s very telling!", "Agree. Her using the phrase hate really stood out to me. It\u2019s not good for you to hate someone like that in my opinion.", "Her comment on this was 90% \u201ceveryone thought my sister was prettier\u201d and 10% \u201cI had to change diapers\u201d. OP is still more upset that her BF thought her sister was prettier than being upset BF wanted to have sex with 13 year old.\n\nShe may have been parentified, but her resentment seems to be more based on her sister being beautiful and OP hating her own appearance.", "And her mother shouldn't have assaulted her. Because that's what it was. She hit her adult child.", "It doesn't sound like she was parentified at all. Watching and babysitting your younger sibling every once in a while is part of being a family, showing maturity, and responsibility. Nowhere does it sound like OP actually was parentified. It reads like anything OP's parents did would be twisted to make OP a victim.\n\nWatching younger siblings and chores are two ways parents teach responsibility. Reddit is quick to call ALL babysitting parentification when it isn't.", "I feel like \u201cparentified\u201d is just a new buzz word for an excuse to being an asshole. I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t exist, but let\u2019s not act like a person is a parent because they babysat and maybe microwaved some macaroni and cheese. As an older sibling it\u2019s normal to help younger siblings.", "I said her comment, not her post. Her comment is 90% \u201cmy sister is prettier\u201d. She complains that her adult BF (20+) found her then-13 year old sister sexier than OP. She flat out says \u201cbeing prettier is a reason to hate someone!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s honestly horrific.", "For sure. It sounds like she was excited to include OP in the party - literally went out of her way to have everyone wait until OP got home and brought them over happily to participate... and OP is just pissed for no reason and rightfully got scolded by mom for being dreadful all the time.", "As a social worker, no this isn't necessarily parentification. Lazy parenting, probably. Little sister had no control over any of the gripes OP has. I think that most of the problem is the sister's looks. Somehow I think if the sister was plain or homely, OP wouldn't have as much of a problem.", "There is a difference when it comes to parentification.\n\nMy younger sibling used to call me mom accidentally.\nAnd when my family visited relatives, She would introduce my handsome older brother, and my younger brother that look just like her.\n\nAnd there are some who didn't even know I existed. As in they came over to take my siblings to the movies, didn't know I there so they didn't invited me.\n\nI don't hate my siblings but it can make a person bitter.\n\nIn cases of parentification often, the younger siblings don't realize what's going on either.  Because the oldest have been programmed to take care of the younger ones and shield them from it. \n\nTo this day sometimes it's hard for me to finish the last of the milk or a food product because my training tells me to save it for somebody else first.  And I've been out of that situation for 20 years.", "To be honest they really haven't given us enough information to determine whether or not it is a case of parentifying. I babysat my sister changed her diapers Etc but my mom always paid me for my time when I babysat her and it was never excessive. I had to pick her up from school but that was a trade-off for my parents getting me a car and really what else was I going to be doing in that time anyways. I wouldn't necessarily trust the OP on this and they don't seem like a reliable narrator", "Also want to add though. The mum sounds like a piece of work. Hit OP and parentified her. And left miss 16 to make her own cake and decorate for her own sweet 16. She might be a single mum, but that sounds like a bs situation for everybody.", "The bf comment got me, too. Even if I hated my little sister ( I dont), I would backhand the shit outta any man saying he wanted bang my 13 yo sister!", "She literally says that she had to give up a huge part of her childhood to take care of her sister.  So yes, this sounds like a case of parentification.", "Her physical appearance certainly got the most real estate in the post.", "Op acts as if the sister chose her looks.", "That was my impression as well.", "I doubt OP was parentified. She would have gone into a lot more detail.", "Seriously, that's so disturbing.", "Once again...she says so. Her narrative of situations are inflated. The way she describes her mom coming in and yelling at her for insulting her step sister show how she narrates with herself as a victim; when she's clearly not. So: No, I don't think she was parentified.", "Especially since little sister baked her own cake, and decorated for her own little party. Lil Sis didn't get some extravagant Sweet Sixteen that OP had to coordinate or pay for."]}
