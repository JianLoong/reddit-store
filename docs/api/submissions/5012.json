I Will never write off my kids forever over money fears.", "If they still have hurt feelings then they don't need OP family's money.", "So its always the dads fault ?", "Good relationships aren\u2019t based on money.", "Don\u2019t be so confident in your decision until one of your children chooses to hold you hostage. Sometimes letting go makes everyone happy. For your family it works but I think it\u2019s fair to try and understand not every child is picture perfect.", "These posts are some of the most heart breaking ngl, mostly for the fact that often there just never is a \"good\" or happy ending.\n\nAlienated kids grow into alienated adults who never question things. Just because they're 18 or older doesn't mean they'll suddenly realize all their prior feelings and assumptions need to be reevaluated.\n\nThe alienated parent eventually just loses hope or, even if some sort of reconciliation is possible, might not want to invest into it given all the prior hurt. We can expect a lot from folks but being ignored or vilified for year after year takes a toll.\n\nThe whole thing is just a pit once it gets this bad.", "That\u2019s great but once you do everything legally possible and the courts tell you to back off, you have no choice. Then, as adults your children do not care to contact you, fuck them. The kids deserve and so does the ex wife.\n\nThey didn\u2019t reach out for a relationship, they reached out for money.", "I think at the end of the day, there\u2019s a very thin line between keep trying and being able to accept things as a consequence. If they still wanted OP, they will see it as effort. If they didn\u2019t want anything to do with OP, it\u2019s just a nuisance. The biggest issue is, now with money at stakes, it\u2019s very hard to know if the kids are interested in keeping a relationship with OP because of family or because of money and whether they will bail once they get the money", "How many years is OP supposed to chase after people that want nothing to do with him? Is there any point at which you think his children share responsibility for the (lack of) relationship that they have with their father?\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable to say 'no I'm not going to the mat for you so that you can extract money from relatives you have no real relationship with.'\n\nEverybody in this story had moved on, until there was a whiff of cash...", "So because they allowed money to brainwash them, they are entitled to money to get them out of their situation?  They are just selfish and need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and get to work.\n\nNoticed they reached out for money, not a relationship", "Sometimes adult children are abusive and it\u2019s better for them and you to let go. Trying only adds fire to the broken relationship. I love all my children, but my quality of life has improved by letting go. We tried for twenty years, at some point you make peace with letting go. I hope you never know the hurt children can cause their parents. Ten years ago I would have like you died on the hill of always trying.  Life however has taught me sometimes loving from a distance is a healthier choice.", "Sorry but now it's up to the OP and his parents if they want a relationship with those kids that are now adults. He already said that he tried many times to build bounds with his kids and they refuse and decided not to spend time with him anymore. He respected that and now they should respect his since they are adults. They are not kids anymore.", "Reconnecting, seeing if there is any kind of relationship that can be repaired. At least removing any doubt if there isnt.\nI would think as an estranged parent would be a good thing.\n\nI didnt say anything about money.", "To clarify, I\u2019d be very against giving any money.  Maybe a trust for OP grandkids college funds, but nothing directly to kids.  Relationship and trust needs to be rebuilt to ensure it\u2019s real, not a long con money grab.", "Never said they were.  Great point.", "I sure hope I never have to face it.", "I guess this kind of situation is what makes us all so unique.  Different mindsets leading to different results.  I\u2019d guess there is no \u2018right\u2019 answers, only choices we make when only crappy options exist and hope it\u2019s the best one. What\u2019s best in one situation is worst in another.  I wish OP the best in his decisions.", "Step 1. Give zero money.\nStep 2. Try to build relationship.\n\nKids will continue to decide step 3.\n\nAs a parent, can always keep trying step 1 and 2.", "I cannot fathom that choice.  My heart aches for you.  My girls are pre-teen, I\u2019m not looking forward to the horror stories of angry teenage outbursts. I cannot imagine the pain of dealing with that into their adulthood as well.  May you find much Love and Peace in your journey.", "Literally this whole thing is about money", "Thank you for hearing my pain! I truly hope and pray you never experience my suffering. I sometimes miss the innocence of not knowing this pain. I have found peace, so their is light at the end of the tunnel. Many blessings to you and your family.", "I think it is more than that. OPs ex might want money. Maybe OP wants a relationship. \nOP as far as i can tell hasnt spoken to his kids in about a decade, so who knows what they want."]}
