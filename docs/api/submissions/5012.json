When I took them the following week they were all vacationed out and just relax.  I had planned for us to enjoy some time outdoors.

We've all worked hard to do better, my sister and I went to therapy to heal and learn to be better people, we've all parented better than we had. We did this because we knew we wanted a different life for ourselves and our kids. \n\nUnfortunately, the opposite happens as well.

We really don't know how long he attempted to call them after, but they were very clear in that they wanted no contact from him. At some point you have to respect your kids wishes and autonomy, even if it hurts your feelings and you know they're misguided. Telling them \"okay, I respect your choice. I will always love you and I will always be here for you if you need/want me, but any contact will be your decision.\" is a hell of a lot more effective then trying to force them to have a relationship by sending constant letters. The latter is not how you show you love someone, if one of my parents did that to me I would find it so slimy and I wouldn't believe a word they said. And then I would change my number, block them on everywhere, and burn every letter they sent without glancing at it. Obsessively trying to contact people who want nothing to do with you only pushes them away further, that's a fact, I've watched it happen many times.

He wasn't going to win any way he went about it. If he respects their decision, he abandoned them! if he pursues contact, he's undermining their ability to choose who they have in their lives! Anything he does is going to \"cement\" that belief because while they live with their mother they're in the fog of manipulation. Only they can decide they want him in their lives, and the odds are more likely they'll reach out if you respected them enough to let them choose. It sucks, but there's only so much you can do.

Especially because there was clear tension between both parents and most kids would rather stay where it\u2019s comfortable instead of having their presence cause issues.

This isn't universal, of course, and many people acknowledge the nuance of the gradient. A racist at 9 we will usually blame on the parents, but assign more and more responsibility to the person, gradually, as they age.\n\nThe second is the strange (to me) view that everyone is inherently capable of overcoming their upbringing. I suppose it comes from having a deterministic viewpoint of things, but those who are able to overcome a twisted upbringing are lucky.\n\nIn my view, we hold adults responsible for their actions, no matter their past, because we have to. In order for society to function that has to be the case. It's not because we can morally blame someone for being a thief when all they knew was poverty, want and abuse in their childhood.
