Do the kids even know she's making these demands?", "So what is he suppose to do say hey kids I want to see you I have money come one pleaseeeeeeeeee", "This account is a bot and stole this partial comment from u/vectron5", "And the exact same is the case for OP and his family? So why should they throw thousands of dollars at them?", "Do you think if they start throwing  money around it should be ok for the kids to want to build a relationship then", "Yes, if she was going to do that it should have been because she realized she robbed her kids of a meaningful relationship with their father and grandparents.", "Sometimes \"maintaining some dignity\" means not pleading and groveling for contact with people who reject you. True, the kids were influenced by their greedy mother. But the kids made their choices. OP can't keep hounding them if they reject him. \n\nEven now, the kids aren't in contact with OP. Their mother is the one with her hand out. The kids can't even be bothered to beg for money from their father.", "They can blame their mother for that then.", "It would be nice if at this point their mother told them the truth. Even if it was for her own selfish reasons of trying to get them some money. She admitted to OP that she made mistakes now if she would just admit it to the children.", "With all due respect you shouldn't keep projecting. Op has his own family to worry about and it's not his MONEY. The grandparents are also estranged from their now adult grandchildren. Also based off this post there's no relationship to salvage here. At best OP would be an enabler and ATM. They don't want a relationship with OP or the rest of his family. Also how about you take into account what OP had gone through when he didn't have much money and lost his children to that AH ex of his? Why should he make himself vulnerable to people who discarded him?", "Hm, did you miss the part where he kept going to court trying to see his kids but at that point they were old enough to just now want to see him and be able to make that decision (so I'm guessing, teenagers) and so he gave up? \nThey clearly know their dad fought for them and wanted to see them so if they wanted any kind of relationship they could reach out now as adults and be like 'sorry dad, we were kids that didn't know better' but they didn't do that. They didn't want a relationship with their dad, back then as kids and clearly now as adults too. \n\nAlso for judgement sake, NTA. Your parents money which means to hey can choose who to give it to.  If I won a million dollars and had estranged family ask for money to help them with debt I would say no. Not my problem. If you don't want me 'at my worst' you don't get me at my best.  (This is just in terms of money, if they want to repair the relationship with no desire or requests for money I'd be open to it)", "Oh absolutely. Thing is, his kids DID NOT reach out. Even now, it's the ex making waves, we don't even know what the kids want.", "Yeah, but we don't know how much of that is the ex's fault. When they're younger, it's easy to throw shiny things at them, and parental alienation can take a long, hard toll. I'd say give them the benefit of the doubt. They could even be embarrassed about how they behaved when they were younger. We simply don't have enough info. I don't think it would hurt to reach out, but of course, that's up to OP.", "They were children. It\u2019s likely it wasn\u2019t just money that brainwashed them.", "To me at least, his kids are Also his family.  I\u2019ve stated numerous times to not give money, but try to repair the relationship.  I\u2019ve not been the parent in a toxic relationship, only the son so I only know what I can project from the parents pov\u2026which is exactly what this sub is.  Projecting our life experiences into an answer of NTA etc.", "If their mother continuously told them OP didn't want to see his kids why would they reach out now", "Maybe OP doesn't want to put in the time and money. Who could blame him? Plus it's his grandparents' money at the end of the day. Let OP's ex wife marry another older man if all she cares about is money and not making ammends. Maybe the next husband will be on a walker.", "....because he went to court proving he wanted to see them. They probably had to tell the court they don't want to see their dad. The mother can turn the kids against the dad without claiming he doesn't want to see them. And they had their 'rich' replacement dad to fill the void their mom created. \n\nEither way, they're adults now. No excuse for not reaching out other than still believing their mom's manipulation and if at that stage as an adult you still rather do that than reach out and find the truth for yourself... that becomes you problem."]}
