You say your ex manipulated your kids from a young age - which she's clearly admitting - but you're still punishing your kids. Obviously your ex is in the wrong for her behaviour, and you've been hurt a lot by her and your kids, but it does seem like you've given up on them and potentially also didn't really try much in the first place - working shouldn't stop you getting shared custody of your children. You should reach out to your kids - potentially with your ex's assistance - and see if you can rebuild a relationship. Acknowledge all your parts in the initial breakdown so you can all move on together without blaming the wrong people. Give your kids a chance to be part of your family again - because it *should* be their family too. I just don't think they should be punished if they've potentially grown up being led to believe their dad just didn't want custody, couldn't be bothered to fight for them, didn't put any effort in or want to spend money on them, and was happy to walk away. It's not their fault if that's what their mum has basically programmed them to believe - they think you're an asshole and your parents' money has nothing to do with it.", "I feel like if they actually wanted to mend the relationship for the sake of the relationship, they'd have reached out in less than 10+ years.", "Also I have not spoken to her since our youngest child graduated high school.
