She had them removed for an individual, and now she's got an individual commenting on how she looked better with them. Also, thats not exactly easy on someone body let alone there mental state. I feel where she's coming from, I'm not sure how you can fix it honestly. Maybe give her some space and then approach with another apology.

You will have to watch your words, and the best ones to use are I love you. I think you are beautiful. If she ever asks how she looks in an outfit- the only acceptable response ( if you hate it) is to say you aren\u2019t fond of the colour. Never make it about her body. Or her age. It sounds like she has had asshole boyfriends in the past and her insecurities have made her change her body to suit their whims. She\u2019s a person, not a doll. \nI don\u2019t know how you get out of this current conversation, so I would just avoid it- change it to talking about how excited you are to go on the trip with her, and don\u2019t try to explain what you meant, because it will only get worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
