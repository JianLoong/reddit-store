How dare she compliment me in the past tense", "Or maybe she liked the fact that the ex-boyfriend liked her body for how it was naturally, without implants. This one likes the implants, unfortunately. He put his foot in it. In any case it wasn\u2019t a kind thing to say. You\u2019re immature, OP. YTA.", "She likes the look of bigger boobs, that's what she told me, she just likes the aesthetic", "She needs to make better choices (the first being dumping OP).

Both guys are losers. Op YTA. Maybe don\u2019t make comments about what your partner used to look like. Just at all.", "[removed]", "That...is not even close to the same situation.", "It wasn\u2019t a compliment.

People generally don't \"twist\" words, but the speaker of those words often tries to walk them back when confronted with what a rude ass they're being.\n\nSuch as this case. She didn't \"twist\" your words, she interpreted them just the same way most people would, and then you realised you'd said the wrong thing. Instead of apologising and bettering your behaviour, you tried to blame HER, by saying she twisted your words. This is pretty damn toxic, if you love this girl, do better. SO much better.\n\nOh yeah, YTA.", "Ah yes thank you!!", "Exactly! There is nothing wrong with getting plastic surgery. I want a tummy tuck more than anything.

I refer to top surgery the same as breast surgery", "Ok that\u2019s mostly fair but you are now twisting words saying he wishes she had big tits which is not what was said at all. Again, he definitely worded what he said poorly but you are making some assumptions", "Do you have any idea, the toll, that 3 vasectomies can have on a person!?", "\"I'm sorry I like women with big breasts,\" or something?\n\nYou're a catch, wow.", "Advise for the future: I\u2019m sorry.

The combination of saying he likes big breasts and the statement that she looked hot \u201cthen\u201d adds up to him wishing she still had the big breasts. \n\nThe math here isn\u2019t difficult"]}
