If the sexes and ages were reversed there would be so many.", "Yeah YTA", "NTA. \n\nIf she looked hot, then she looked hot and I wouldn't call you an AH for saying so. But you are a tactless clod who should know better. Well, you know better now.", "First of all, the age gap is concerning. It's right up against the edge of okay but you're dating someone too old for you. \n\nAs a general life note though, a person only gets cosmetic surgery if they feel desperately insecure about their looks. So if its something they no longer have - like a breast implant- you should absolutely always presume you shouldn't say or imply they looked better then. It's cruel.\n\nSo overall, YTA", "NTA : Communication is sometimes a bit tricky and everyone here is sticking to a \"then\" to decide.\nHell, finding your girlfriend hot in a bikini picture shouldn't be a problem.\nThing is, she's already insecure : she put breast implants and then removed because of ex.\n\nSo she has a problem to deal with. You should help her gain more confidence but you don't have to change your tastes.\nHaving a bad wording and being outright AH are quite different.\n\nI shall also say that she shouldn't wait to talk things out. As you described it (\"she looked upset later at dinner and when I asked her...\"), it looks like she wouldn't have expressed her feelings if you hadn't asked.\nBeing assertive is important in a relationship and not talking things out is just making them worse.", "Imagine if she said to you that she liked her ex boyfriends penis because it was bigger than you. \n\n\nyta.", "Common sense dictates, YTA.", "Yikes. YTA. This is clearly a part of her body she feels insecure about. Insecure enough to get implants, and then insecure enough again to remove them. Why would you add to that? \n\nI hope she can feel comfortable enough in her body to no longer listen and act upon stupid comments like that from people who are supposed to lift her up and make her feel beautiful.", "NTA. My husband and I always say how good the other person looked in old pics. I've gone through hair colors and he has said one looks \"hot\" in a pic. That doesn't mean him liking that hair color more or in that pic changes how he views me now. I also wouldn't change my hair color on someone else's preference i.e. breast implants. She's insecure and sadly is too swayed by the opinion of others. She should choose to have implants or not and be happy with her decision.", "NTA She chooses to hear your words about a point in time photo the way she did. She hears it this way because she got them in the first place for the wrong reason.  She did not get them for herself, then took them out for a bf & is upset that you commented on her looking hot.\nSometimes men cannot win.  This is one of those times.  Apologize love her like you already do & show actions that make her understand your desire for her now is deeper than just flesh or external beauty.  You love her cause she is beautiful on the inside & out & you love her just the way she is & anyway she may change will not change your love for her.  Shower her with your love language that proves she is perfect for you.\nGood luck", "This, YTA and kind of doubting your maturity in this relationship", "Hopefully it\u2019s herself she\u2019ll find and love. Society is so brutal always trying to convince you you\u2019re not enough, just so you can buy their stuff.", "This is the only comment on this thread that makes sense. The girlfriend is trigger ready. Makes no sense.\n\nOp comment is natural. People can't be commented on past looks? But can have plastic surgery twice? \n\nNTA", "Kinda doubting the girlfriends maturity overall.", "Perhaps. I was just curious if she did it for a guy. OP said the GF took them out for a guy, so I was just wondering if she put them in there in the first place for the same reason.", "Wouldn't there also be medical complications to getting implants put in and removed over and over? I can't imagine the body would just let that happen with no side effects", "I don't know why that's getting downvoted. I'm a woman and that line about her changing the implants to please a previous partner immediately alarmed me. What even is that!? We aren't talking about shaving your legs here. It's *surgery.* If you're going to get surgery, get it for you, and do what you like. Don't let the whims of others dictate what you do when it comes to surgery. This is lunacy.", ">That\u2019s exactly where my mind went. Both guys are losers. Op YTA. Maybe don\u2019t make comments about what your partner used to look like. Just at all.\n\nI think she's very insecure, she's dating these very immature men that are much younger than her, and getting surgery to please them. I don't think any of this is good for any of them.", "Nah, people twist words all the f-ing time. Not that you are wrong in this case, but generally, yeah, no this happens, a lot.", "And you just manipulated her right back. YTA, and I really do hope that she finds someone who loves her for who she is.", "I appreciate the perspective. I do. I see your point. However, I disagree only because it's in the \"how\", it's the delivery, as well as the status of the relationship at that point.   \n\n\nUsing my example, my wife and I have been together for 15 years. We're ridiculously content in life, still so much in love, even after all this time.  I love the shit out of her. Anyway, we're not as young as we once were. We see pictures of each other, whether its grey hairs, my chin that tends to carry baggage nowadays. We can playfully give each other shit, and it's ok. It's in jest. No one's feelings are hurt, and 99% of the time, laughter ensues.   \n\n\nBut again, this is my situation. Just offering another perspective that \"never\" doesn't mean \"never\". Thanks for sharing and allowing me to share.", "Snip snap, snip snap!!", "I think it's fine for a partner to have an opinion on plastic surgery that can matter. If one's partner has a kink for big boobs and one is in a long lasting relationship, that should influence the decision. However, one's decision is always final - if one wishes to have a breast reduction despite this, the partner should always support that decision. In this case, OP is AH because he indicates to his partner that she should change, on his own accord and in a crass way,  not when asked because she was considering it first.", "No they wouldn\u2019t but they\u2019d also give him shit for being mad when she does immature shit. If you\u2019re in your 30s and dating a 24yo, that\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s choice, but then don\u2019t get mad when the 24yo acts like a 24yo.", "An apology followed by an attempted justification is not an apology at all. \n\nAlso, please stop saying \u201cboobs\u201d and \u201ctits\u201d when referring to your girlfriend\u2019s breasts. You sound stupid.", "He said in his comments \u2018big tits are nice\u2019. What are you, 12?"]}
