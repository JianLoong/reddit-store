If a complaint is made to Child Protective Services (CPS) regarding not using a car seat, the agency will investigate the complaint to determine if there is any evidence of neglect or abuse. Depending on the outcome of the investigation, CPS may take a number of different actions, including providing education and resources to the family, making a referral for services, or taking legal action to remove the child from the home. It's important to note that each case is unique and the specific course of action will depend on the individual circumstances. It's also worth noting that CPS will only investigate cases where a child may be at risk of harm, and if there is no evidence of risk, CPS will close the case.  \n\n\nAny time you open up someone to that scrutiny there can be outcomes that you don't want. That said, you are not wrong about the safety risk. If you really have confronted her about this a few times I doubt she will have trouble figuring out where the complaint came from.", "NTA - but instead of calling CPS and making a case out of it, try this.  The next time she comes over to visit, when she leaves, call the police and report an unrestrained child in a car.  Give them the make, model, color and license plate(all info one will have when seeing a car on the road).  She will get a ticket and have to pay a fine and there won't be a CPS case pending that could damage everyone involved.  If she still let's the child roam after the ticket, then a call to CPS would be warranted.", "NTA. He may not be abused or mistreated, but he\u2019s being neglected. He could die in an otherwise minor car accident. Your cousin is being extremely irresponsible. I know CPS can really suck though. You might lose your friendship with your cousin, but maybe threaten it to her before calling to see if she actually changes. Alternatively, call the police when you know where and when she is out driving. They will certainly give her a ticket. I don\u2019t know if they would also call CPS, probably depends on the cop.", "YWBTA.  Obviously you have to do something.  But I'm pretty sure the thing to do is to give your cousin a call, send a text, or arrange for a carrier pigeon and tell her that this is absolutely unacceptable.  Children have car seats and seat belts for a reason.\n\n**IF** that doesn't work, then call CPS.  Don't waste governmental resources when the only thing preventing you from confronting this directly is a tiny shot of bravery.", "Not having a child in a car seat is reckless endangerment.

At the very least alert the police about it, with all the pertinent information (make/model, etc). You wouldn't be able to live with yourself if something happened and he was hurt or worse.", "Do you have a child safety seat place near you.  Like here, you can go to any fire station, and they will check your seat.  Offer to go with her to get him fitted for a properly installed car seat.  They will talk to her, and they will talk to him.\n\nIf that doesn't work, next time she leaves your home and the kiddo is not in a safety seat, call the police and let them pull her over.  It will be up to their discretion to call CPS and that takes you out of the line of fire.\n\nYou are certainly NTA unless you don't do anything to try to address the situation.  What she is doing is endangering that kiddo.  Car seats are nonnegotiable.", "I have a story about this, my now ex-husband, when my kids were small, would go to pick up the older kids and leave the little one in the car while he ran up to the door to get the older kids.  One of the well-meaning parents saw the child and reported CPS for it.  They came to our home and did an investigation.  I did not know he left my kid in the car, I was working, I actually appreciated this being brought to light for me, and they educated my ex on why that was not acceptable, even with the car running or the windows down.  \n\nCPS will investigate and educate your cousin on why this is not acceptable, even if the child is upset and screaming.  CPS is corrupt in some places, so read about it, but mostly they will address the issue, make sure the kid is ok, and close the case.  I don't know who called in on my ex, but I'm not upset it was done, he needed the wake-up call.

Yes, your cousin should be using a car seat or wear a seat belt (the godson's age is not listed).  However, I do not think it is the type of abuse or neglect that justifies the authorities getting involved.  If he does not have a sensory issue, kids are smart enough to know what they can get away with dealing with one person they can't with another.  Therefore, maybe try having him in your car with the appropriate safety system and see if he can grow accustomed to it.", "The cops will almost certainly call CPS.  They may even take emergency custody of the child.", "Police are mandatory reporters. This would result in a police report to CPS.", "Honestly this is more likely to result in anything happening.
