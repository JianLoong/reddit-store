Our dad died 5 years ago. Mom remarried a year later. Mom's husband adopted my brother and my brother calls him dad and loves him as his only dad. This is something everyone around us knows and while it is somewhat hard for my paternal relatives and even me, for him to have no interest in dad, we have accepted he was so little that dad was just a person he's heard about and he doesn't have an emotional attachment toward him. But a couple of weeks ago my grandparents stopped by my mom's house (I moved out) and I stopped by quickly to see them. Grandpa was out of the room for something and grandma was talking to my brother about how big he was getting. My brother was telling her all about mom's husband and how he was doing certain things. He mentioned how they were doing a special father/son trip for Father's Day and how I said no to going and how strange he found it because \"dad wants to be with his boys but OP doesn't let him be his dad\". Then he blurts out of nowhere that he's glad dad died because it meant he got his dad and he liked that he had him instead of my dad. Grandma froze and he kept talking like he'd said nothing wrong. She ended up bursting into tears and leaving. Mom asked what had happened, heard what my brother had said, and was like, oh she's just being too sensitive. I told mom he shouldn't be saying stuff like that. She said it's true and how she's glad he's dead too. I told her they might not have been happily married near the end (I think trying for a second child for years strained their marriage a lot and when my brother did arrive and cried all the time that it left them in an even worse place) but he was still the reason she had us and even if my brother never considers him a dad, he will always be my dad, and her husband did not change that. She told me it could have if I'd accepted him.\n\nMy mom made it very clear that she would not correct him for saying that. So when he wanted to hang out with me Saturday I decided to bring it up to him. He actually started the conversation saying grandma and I had acted weird when she visited. I told him that was because what he said was really hurtful and even if it is how he feels, saying that when he was her son and my dad, was not a very kind thing to do. He asked if I was mad at him and I told him I had to force myself not to be. But he had to understand that while he feels how he does, our grandparents and I love dad, and that mom's husband did not take his place. And we would never be glad he's gone. He got upset and told me he wanted to go home. So I brought him home.\n\nMom and her husband were pissed with a capital P and said it was not my place and I was putting too much on his shoulders.

So I don't particularly blame them for being defensive and upset. They're wrong, though.\n\nSorry, you're an adult, and this is a conflict between adults. Which is to say, you get *some* say in matters of this sort, and you have the most say when it is about something you directly witnessed and participated in, that your mother and stepfather did not.\n\nYour brother is an innocent, so I am sorry he is upset.

I wonder how she would feel if someone told her that they were happy that either you or your brother was dead.", "NTA It might be rough but I\u2019d let your grandparents know what\u2019s been said and advise they don\u2019t contact them because as far as they are concerned they aren\u2019t really family. Make sure you stay in contact with them and let them know that you are on their side and how hurt you are that this is happening.", " NTA\n\nYour mom needs counseling. Her position is making it harder for you to have a good relationship with your stepdad because she\u2019s actively trying to make him a replacement. Also she clearly isn\u2019t capable of teaching your brother how to talk about all of this appropriately. Your brother is very young and needs to learn from adults who have a healthier perspective. Your stepdad should also be setting a good example for how to honor the memory of your father while also creating a warm relationship with your brother. That\u2019s his responsibility as much as your mom\u2019s. At your age all you can do is suggest family therapy and hope that they one day make better choices. Individual therapy for you might also be a good idea since it sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot and you deserve more support.", "NTA, I fucking hate your mother and her husband. \nnice place in hell waiting for pricks like them.", "NTA. Neither is your brother. He\u2019s too young and this is basically all he\u2019s known. Your mom\u2026 pretty much the asshole here.", "NTA, he is a child and mostly blameless but something tells me after your mothers reaction she is the cause,", "NTA. I'm sorry you lost your dad. Your mother and brother are wrong. Your brother is an innocent child. Your mother is deliberately cruel.", "NTA. But I\u2019d bet money that your little brother is getting that directly from your mom and step dad. Kids don\u2019t think like that. Your mom isn\u2019t making him  take it back cause she put it there in the first place.", "NTA. Your parents are disgusting", "NTA.\n\nBut as some people have said, the problem isn't your brother, he's a child. It's your mother. She and her husband are obviously saying \"I'm glad your father died\" often enough that your brother has picked up on it and believe it to be true. I'd go LC/NC with them and focus on your relationship with your brother. Keep telling him stuff like that, tell him the shit they say is cruel. Because it is.", "NTA\n\nYou need to explain to your brother that his bio dad was his grandmother's child and misses him very much. So, even if he's happy with his new dad, he needs to understand that his grandma lost her son for him to get his new dad.\n\nYour mom and brother are seeing as \"bio dad died\" but in this situation people need to be sensitive to the fact that someone's child died. \n\nIt's about teaching compassion, understanding, and emotional intelligence.", "NTA. Your mom is a jerk though", "NTA\n\nThe explanation you gave your brother was age appropriate and non-judgmental of him personally. You\u2019re a good big brother to care enough to impart this valuable life lesson.", "NTA. Your brother needs to learn that some \"truths\" should not be spoken aloud. Your mother is doing him a disservice.", "NTA, someone has to be a responsible adult and teach little brother that words have meaning and consequences.", "OP I wonder what your maternal grandparents might have to say about this if they're still in the picture.\n\nMaybe try framing it to your mother \"What if lilbro said he was glad you were dead to your mother, what if were the reverse situation?\". Like your mother might not have it contextualized in her brain that her son told a mother that he was glad their child was dead. What is wrong in her head?\n\nNTA OP.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nLook when I was about six or seven, I remember driving by this old cemetery with my mom. It\u2019s gothic style and really old, looked really really cool. I always wanted to go in there. I remember telling my mom, \u201cI can\u2019t wait for grandma to die so we could go there.\u201d  \n\nMy mom turned to me very quickly and said, \u201cit\u2019s not OK for you to say that. That is not a good thing to say. Never say anything like that again.\u201d I stayed quiet and really thought about it and realized yeah that\u2019s messed up. \n\nI know what i said was wrong. I\u2019m not trying to excuse my behavior, but I think kids just have a habit of blurting things out without even thinking them. Other people on here have said that he is just parroting what your mom is saying, but that might not be the case. No one ever said anything about my grandma passing so we could go to that cemetery. It was just a thought I had, and I blurted it out. And I was told what I said was wrong; it was a teaching moment really. If anyone is an asshole here, it\u2019s your mom for not wanting to correct her child. It\u2019s OK that he has found a father figure, but it\u2019s not OK for him to say that he\u2019s glad his dad died.", "NAH except your mom", "NTA\n\nI think it's fair to talk to your brother about how it's not ok be glad about anyone dying and that's it's hurtful to say such a thing to the deceased's loved ones. Even if this wasn't about your dad, it was still incredibly rude and unacceptable behaviour.\n\nYour brother might be upset with facing he's hurt people with what he said, especially if he thinks it's somehow ok to say such a thing. Your brother seemed overwhelmed when he learned you were angry. Maybe have another talk about how what he said is hurtful and explore if his feelings are him experiencing deep shame for the first time. If so, explain that he can start to make up for it by apologising and not doing it again.", "She is actually saying that just because their marriage was not happy, she's glad he died?! Like his life had no value or purpose outside of being her husband.", "If your mom and step dad won\u2019t, that\u2019s honestly just messed up.", "The way my fist would've made it to her face after hearing her say that.", "I think Mom might be TA.", "I agree that it is hard for a 7 year old to understand but saying there's no AH is wrong, the mom is definitely an AH for refusing to see what her youngest said was hurtful and not trying to explain that what he said wasn't ok. She's like far too many people out there that are selfish and think just because they love their new partner, that means their child(ren) should also love the new partner and allow them to replace their bio parent", "lol OPs mom told him to his face that she was glad his dad was dead", "If he says that as an adult, tell him you wish the stepdad was dead so that you can celebrate and be happy, then ask how that feels.", "It might take until he\u2019s an adult for him to truly understand how messed up that kind of narrative is. Please don\u2019t give up on him as a teen when he\u2019s bound to say all sorts of terrible things at some point or another because that\u2019s what teens do.", "Honestly, as an adult it is your responsibility to explain to him why you and your grandmother were upset about what he said. That is how a child learns empathy, by understanding how their words and actions affect those around them. Not every child can understand those clues. Where a clear explanation without anger can help them. \n\nI was a child that needed people's emotional outburst explained often. Your mother seems to be emotionally stunted as she is carrying a grudge against someone that has been gone awhile. She, yourself and your brother could probably benefit from family therapy. \n\nNTA", "He needs to go no contact with all of them. I can\u2019t believe that his mother is glad her husbands dead! She would be dead to me after saying that..", "But at the end of the day that was your decision to make, and you were old enough to have had a developed relationship with him. My boyfriend lost his mom when he was around the same age you lost your dad and while he was adopted and loves his adoptive mom, she knows and acknowledges that she will never replace his bio mom. He\u2019s made that clear to her just like you\u2019ve made that clear to your mom. Neither you or your brother are TA, but your mom definitely is", "Not might be, definitely is", "I missed the part where she agreed, I thought she was just not wanting to correct the 7 year old", "Not might, mom is definitely the AH. What she said was cruel and unnecessary, and if she\u2019s not careful, she\u2019s going to lose her older son.", "I\u2019m not saying he shouldn\u2019t be corrected, but that\u2019s some high level emotional ideals.  This is the timeline he lives in and his life is great. Asking him to think otherwise isn\u2019t really fair to him. He can apologize but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s truly understand what exactly he was apologizing for", "I missed that part, my bad", "  Does she also dislike your grandma? I wonder how she would feel if someone told her that they were happy that either you or your brother was dead.", " NAH. The seven year old child is learning and growing. Your mother lost her spouse and still had two boys to raise. Stepfather must be doing an incredible job with your brother for your brother to feel as if he has a father in his life. You are just tryna help your brother learn that words can have consequences which is a very valuable lesson.", "Yeah you could have had a much better relationship with him if he and your mother had taken a more respectful and understanding stance on your dad.", "People put their own crap on children all the time. There is no real reason why his bio dad needs to be brought up at this stage. Not saying you lie, but putting a child into a point where he has to choose is weird. Kids can just love who is around them regardless of the specific dynamics at play. It kinda sounds like the grand parents and older son want to constantly remember the guy who died and the mom, stepdad and younger kid just want to move on with their lives. Both are correct and they could likely learn from each other"]}
