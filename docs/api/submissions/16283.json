Our dad died 5 years ago. Mom remarried a year later. Mom's husband adopted my brother and my brother calls him dad and loves him as his only dad. This is something everyone around us knows and while it is somewhat hard for my paternal relatives and even me, for him to have no interest in dad, we have accepted he was so little that dad was just a person he's heard about and he doesn't have an emotional attachment toward him. But a couple of weeks ago my grandparents stopped by my mom's house (I moved out) and I stopped by quickly to see them. Grandpa was out of the room for something and grandma was talking to my brother about how big he was getting. My brother was telling her all about mom's husband and how he was doing certain things. He mentioned how they were doing a special father/son trip for Father's Day and how I said no to going and how strange he found it because \"dad wants to be with his boys but OP doesn't let him be his dad\". Then he blurts out of nowhere that he's glad dad died because it meant he got his dad and he liked that he had him instead of my dad. Grandma froze and he kept talking like he'd said nothing wrong. She ended up bursting into tears and leaving. Mom asked what had happened, heard what my brother had said, and was like, oh she's just being too sensitive. I told mom he shouldn't be saying stuff like that. She said it's true and how she's glad he's dead too. I told her they might not have been happily married near the end (I think trying for a second child for years strained their marriage a lot and when my brother did arrive and cried all the time that it left them in an even worse place) but he was still the reason she had us and even if my brother never considers him a dad, he will always be my dad, and her husband did not change that. She told me it could have if I'd accepted him.\n\nMy mom made it very clear that she would not correct him for saying that. So when he wanted to hang out with me Saturday I decided to bring it up to him. He actually started the conversation saying grandma and I had acted weird when she visited. I told him that was because what he said was really hurtful and even if it is how he feels, saying that when he was her son and my dad, was not a very kind thing to do. He asked if I was mad at him and I told him I had to force myself not to be. But he had to understand that while he feels how he does, our grandparents and I love dad, and that mom's husband did not take his place. And we would never be glad he's gone. He got upset and told me he wanted to go home. So I brought him home.\n\nMom and her husband were pissed with a capital P and said it was not my place and I was putting too much on his shoulders.

I can\u2019t believe she was so cruel and said that to you).\nYou should just move on from it though, especially since your mother is actively encouraging him to think that way. Hopefully your little brother will learn with time that even if he feels no kinship to his bio dad, he needs to understand that it\u2019s different for other people.", "NTA what you said is a basic decency and 7 years old is not too young to know that words can hurt people.  However the issue is not your brother but your mom who is not just an A but also a heartless b..h to say to you she is glad your dad died. I am amazed you still talking to her", "NTA - the only ass here is your mother. Your brother is still to young to fully understand death and grief. He\u2019s also 7 - kids say stupid shit. \n\nYour mom on the other hand. Wow. I don\u2019t even know where to start on how messed up what she said was. \n\nYou weren\u2019t wrong to have this conversation with your brother as long as it was done with kindness and at an age appropriate level.\n\nEdit: everyone can benefit from some therapy here. Your mom has some unresolved abandonment and grief issues that are being misdirected. You and your brother lost a father at very different places in your lives. It\u2019s a hard loss at any age.", "NTA\n\n7 year olds will say this sort of thing, but that's because they're inexperienced and are still learning social conventions. The correct thing to do is tell them that they've done wrong so they learn.\n\nDid your mother end up hating your dad so much that she's still angry with him years after he died? Even if that was the case, there's no reason that his parents should be hurt as a result.", "NTA \n\nYour brother is only seven and I'm sure he didn't understand how hurtful the things he said was. Assuming you spoke to him in a calm and loving manner, it doesn't seem to me that the words you said to him were inappropriate at all. But he's old enough to start needing to \"put himself in other people's shoes,\" and think about how your grandmother feels when someone tells her \"I'm glad your son died\" or how you feel when someone tells you \"I'm glad your dad died\" (how would he feel if your mother's husband died, and someone said that to him?).\n\nBut your mother, for *agreeing* with him? She's the asshole here.", "NTA. Your mom is seriously flawed here. Would she like someone to tell her they wished either of her sons be dead? It is understandable that your brother loves his stepdad. That\u2019s good. But in order to raise a well-adjusted, kind, empathetic human being, your mother (and since she dropped the ball, you) must guide the younger child in learning to be sensitive. Obviously the grandparents care about your brother. He should be taught to be considerate of them. I also think that mom\u2019s lack of respect for your feelings toward your dad are messed up. \nI\u2019m so sorry you have to \u201cdefend\u201d your dad. \nPlease know that you are definitely NTA. You are being a good son, a good brother, and a good grandson. A good person all around.", "NTA. Saying something like \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead\u201d in this situation, especially to his bio dad\u2019s parents are completely wrong. I think you did a great job of age appropriately explaining this to him too. He\u2019s allowed to feel the way he does, but it\u2019s not always right to just blurt something hurtful out like that. And you mom not wanting to \u201ccorrect\u201d him makes her the ass. It\u2019s not about correcting him, it\u2019s about teaching him that certain things should not be said to or in front of people.  What\u2019s \u201csocially unacceptable\u201d and what\u2019s not.", "NTA but neither is your brother. Your mum on the other hand is cruel and insensitive", "NTA. Regardless of what your mum may think of your deceased father, there is something called common decency. And it seems in this case she's unwilling to teach your little brother that.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry this is happening. Your mom is handling all this in the worst possible way. Your brother is old enough to be taught the lesson you\u2019re trying to impart. Good for you for apparently being the only one trying to teach him empathy and situational awareness.", "NTA. Your conversation with your brother was truthful and kind. Your mother and stepfather are, though, for trying to erase your dad.", ">Mom and her husband were pissed with a capital P and said it was not my place and I was putting too much on his shoulders.\n\nYeah, NTA.\n\nI certainly think you were exercising not a small bit of parental-like authority, even if it was mixed in with you being a sibling. So I don't particularly blame them for being defensive and upset. They're wrong, though.\n\nSorry, you're an adult, and this is a conflict between adults. Which is to say, you get *some* say in matters of this sort, and you have the most say when it is about something you directly witnessed and participated in, that your mother and stepfather did not.\n\nYour brother is an innocent, so I am sorry he is upset. If he is to grow up to have more good days than bad, he must *learn* self-control. That won't happen if everything is peaches and roses. \\[Edit:\\] Telling your brother you had to force yourself not to be mad at him in answer to his question was a kindness.", "NTA.  It\u2019s never too early to help kids understand that what they say can be hurtful to others even if it was unintentional.  You were trying to help him understand that.  Your mother, on the other hand, is an insensitive flaming a-hole for encouraging your brother\u2018s rudeness.", "NTA and neither is your brother. There are strong emotions involved. Your brother is old enough to benefit from a teachable moment. Imparting empathy and compassion is never a lost cause. Your brother may be upset for now but he's old enough to understand how words can hurt someone's feelings even if they are his own feelings or emotions; that there are ways of sharing your own feelings and thoughts without needlessly hurting others.", "NTA: You are teaching your brother empathy and manners. He'll never learn to think about what he says if excuses are made when he hurts someone's feelings. You did not yell or call him names. You spoke honestly and at his level.\n\nYour father died 5 years ago. Your brother probably doesn't even remember him. Where he's getting this \"I'm glad he's dead\" attitude is probably your mother. I'd talk with her about watching what she says.\n\nLet your grandmother know you spoke with your brother. It won't erase the hurt but it will make her feel better knowing someone spoke with him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Someone needed to tell him that what he said and who he said it around was absolutely unacceptable though and if your mom and step dad won\u2019t, that\u2019s honestly just messed up.  Nothing to ruin the relationship over but still needed to be talked about.  You have a great grasp of the situation and emotional compassion.", "Nta. 7 is a perfectly good age to learn empathy.

The only AH here is mom for being dismissive of grandma and OPs feelings.", "Sounds like Mom is well on her way to being NC with Grandma, because now you all know how Mom really feels.\n\nMost likely, your brother was repeating something that Mom says to him often enough that it felt natural for it to come up in conversation. Mom and stepdad are the AHs here.\n\nNTA.", "I have to talk to her to talk to him. If I could cut her off I would. Though honestly, if he grows up saying stuff like that as a teen and older, I'll cut my losses and go no contact with him too. For now he's a kid and she's influencing it. But it's one of those things that will come between us if he keeps saying it for years and years.", "I think so. She has always been annoyed that I didn't accept her husband the way my brother did. The offer for him to adopt me was there also. But I was never interested. I don't want a second dad. That pissed her off. Also the fact I refused to take down all photos of dad. I kept some in my room when I lived there still and told her she needed to deal with it.", "It always amazes me that parents expect a step-parent to be a drop-in replacement. Sure, it works for a 2-year old, but a teenager is going to have had some solid positive experiences.\n\nThere are so many angry step-parent/step-child stories here, I think the apparently reasonably civil relationship you have is pretty good going.", "Sounds like she got a lot of resentment. Your brother might have heard those words from her very own mouth. Its a wonder how those thoughts came about from him. Perhaps you can explore that.", "It would be easier for her if I just let dad be erased. It would be easier for her if I loved her husband more than my dad. But he's just the guy she's married to. He's also the guy who always seemed to cheer on erasing my dad so he could take over. So he was never going to be my favorite person ever. But then again neither is my mom."]}
