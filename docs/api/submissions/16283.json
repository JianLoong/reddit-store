Our dad died 5 years ago. Mom remarried a year later. Mom's husband adopted my brother and my brother calls him dad and loves him as his only dad. This is something everyone around us knows and while it is somewhat hard for my paternal relatives and even me, for him to have no interest in dad, we have accepted he was so little that dad was just a person he's heard about and he doesn't have an emotional attachment toward him. But a couple of weeks ago my grandparents stopped by my mom's house (I moved out) and I stopped by quickly to see them. Grandpa was out of the room for something and grandma was talking to my brother about how big he was getting. My brother was telling her all about mom's husband and how he was doing certain things. He mentioned how they were doing a special father/son trip for Father's Day and how I said no to going and how strange he found it because \"dad wants to be with his boys but OP doesn't let him be his dad\". Then he blurts out of nowhere that he's glad dad died because it meant he got his dad and he liked that he had him instead of my dad. Grandma froze and he kept talking like he'd said nothing wrong. She ended up bursting into tears and leaving. Mom asked what had happened, heard what my brother had said, and was like, oh she's just being too sensitive. I told mom he shouldn't be saying stuff like that. She said it's true and how she's glad he's dead too. I told her they might not have been happily married near the end (I think trying for a second child for years strained their marriage a lot and when my brother did arrive and cried all the time that it left them in an even worse place) but he was still the reason she had us and even if my brother never considers him a dad, he will always be my dad, and her husband did not change that. She told me it could have if I'd accepted him.\n\nMy mom made it very clear that she would not correct him for saying that. So when he wanted to hang out with me Saturday I decided to bring it up to him. He actually started the conversation saying grandma and I had acted weird when she visited. I told him that was because what he said was really hurtful and even if it is how he feels, saying that when he was her son and my dad, was not a very kind thing to do. He asked if I was mad at him and I told him I had to force myself not to be. But he had to understand that while he feels how he does, our grandparents and I love dad, and that mom's husband did not take his place. And we would never be glad he's gone. He got upset and told me he wanted to go home. So I brought him home.\n\nMom and her husband were pissed with a capital P and said it was not my place and I was putting too much on his shoulders.

So I don't particularly blame them for being defensive and upset. They're wrong, though.\n\nSorry, you're an adult, and this is a conflict between adults.

All children can develop differently depending on their environment, how they're raised, the situations they've been around, their emotional intelligence in general... so many factors play into this.\n\nSo 1) I highly doubt the child was the one to come up with 'I'm glad dad died because now I have *my* dad' on his own. I think that he would be more likely to think 'This dad is my favorite dad' and, like someone else said, is parroting his mother and putting those two things together, \"I'm glad dad is dead blahblah\". The child should be cut some slack because death is very hard to grasp unless you were old enough to fully witness and understand it, but it should be something they should sit down and gently explain to him. His sibling explaining to him why it hurt them + grandma was a good start, even though telling him that they were 'trying not to be mad' seemed harsh, and it would have been better to say 'i'm upset but not mad'.\n\n2) The fact that the younger sibling caught on to grandma + OP 'acting weird' shows that those empathetic skills are at work. And him asking if OP was mad at him also shows that he understands OP could have been masking their emotions, since it didn't seem like OP was mad at them up until the explanation was offered. He was able to make connections, though not fully to an older child's level, but enough to get upset and realize that he may have messed up and that OP was upset/mad. OP saying that it's okay/they understand that's how 7yo feels, but he needs to remember that OP and grandma love biodad just like how 7yo loves stepdad, so he shouldn't say mean things--that was perfect to build onto his emotional development (even if 7yo got upset)\n\nIf anything, I dont think the younger sibling understands the bonds, but is now beginning to see them. (Like biodad being grandma's son)\n\nTHe mom and stepdad obviously have issues with the ex husband that passed away, since it sounds like the mom didn't like him near the end as it were. The fact that they are forcing those feelings onto a 7 year old (and probably when he was even younger) is damaging and problematic. The mom has probably always spoken badly of bio dad, or never allowed the child to hear much of him, see much of him (like photos/videos), even heard good things about it, plus to the kid stepdad has always been 'the best dad' cause he's in his life.\n\nIt all just sounds very manipulative towards the 7 year old. He shouldn't be blamed for what he spouted, but it's unfair to him that he doesn't get any full explanations on things. He gets this bite-sized explanation and feels emotions over it, which is good, and if mom + stepdad weren't being huge AHs, they could have made this a learning experience rather than the 7 year old possibly now resenting OP + grandma for loving bio dad.\n\nKids are sponges. And unlearning cruelty and hatred is very difficult.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo OP: NTA\n\nTo Stepdad + Mom: Huge freakin AHs\n\nTo 7yo: I hope the brainrot and brainwashing from his parents don't scar him for forever. Being glad someone died and having that confirmed by his mother can and will lead to saying inappropriate things down the line, and may very well mess with that empathy as well as attachments to others.", "Well you see, it's different because muh ego would be hurt, you see, so it's very different. I'm still here and he isn't, you see, so he doesn\u2019t have the feelings I have, so it's really quite hurtful, you see, to try and imagine me dead. /s", "If ever there was a time to go LC/NC with a parent, it's when they tell you to your face that they're glad your other parent is dead. I wonder about how good of an environment your sibling is being raised in. I would honestly speak to your grandparents and consider getting the courts involved to see about the possibility of them taking custody, if they're able. I can't imagine a judge, psychologists, or social workers looking too kindly on a situation where it's being reenforced that having a dead parent is a wonderful thing.\n\nNTA", "Try not to be upset at your brother so much. But your mother is an AH. I would seriously be pissed at her. I think your brother is getting these ideas from your mom!", "NTA. No one is but your mom.", "NTA. Your response was kind and truthful.", "NTA I wonder if your mom God forbid was in that situation how would she had felt. Putting ourselves in other people' s shoes will keep us from saying means words to others. I'm glad your brother feels happy to get a replacement dad but still doesn't show your mother's good parenting skills if she thinks that was ok.I hope life doesn't teach your mom a lesson. We parents don't have any choice on our own grown children behaviors and mostly still love them mistakes and all. Being mean to your grandma won't fix the past but may influence the families future.  Sometimes we think we can do without family members but life is a rollercoaster and it's better to live with dignity and grace.", "> Mom and her husband were pissed with a capital P and said it was not my place and I was putting too much on his shoulders.\n\nNTA\n\nAlso, step dad being mad is full on ridiculous. He has NO RIGHT to be mad and should be understanding that he won\u2019t be able to fill in the holes your bio dad left. Just because of that he\u2019s also TA.", "Cruelty is not okay.", "Wow you think it's ok that his mother told him she is glad his dad is dead?  And doesn't see the need to teach her younger son empathy and how we don't say hurtful things to people?  Really?", "I'm wondering if there's a possible way to speak to his school and explain what was said? Usually counselors are around, and what he said is VERY concerning. This isn't a CPS type event, but this could lead to other behaviors that are problematic, and the counselor might be able to step in and have a talk with your mom and stepdad about this. Hearing 'saying these types of things is scary/unhealthy/psychologically concerning' from a professional might get through to your mom more than you or grandma.\n\nThis may risk your mom getting mad at you, but I feel like this wouldn't just be brushed aside at school, especially if you mention that your mom said the same thing to you. There is such a thing as emotional abuse, and a mother teaching a young kid that wishing death on someone/being happy that someone is dead is a huge red flag to most school systems.\n\nJust a suggestion, though. Then you'd have others on your side, and could possibly get your mom into therapy too so she can work past her own demons.", "Right?! Like no wonder why she doesn\u2019t think she should be teaching her young son different!", "The fact that she said his grandmother was too sensitive when she was told by her grandson that *he was glad her kid had died* was cruel and God forbid one of her kids die and that exact sentence said to her because i doubt she'd handle it well either (no i don't want the son or OP to die i case anyone accidentally takes what i said in a weird way)", "The old saying the \u201capple doesn\u2019t fall from the tree\u201d describes  the mom and the 7 year old perfectly. The mom is beyond cruel and heartless to tell that to her older son and not feel any sympathy for the parental grandmother on losing her son. The loss of my younger brother devastated my parents & while it\u2019s been almost 20 years, the pain is still there. what was so bittersweet was my youngest nephew who was born after he passed said when he gets to heaven, his uncle will be his BFF. I hope the 7 yr old does not grow up to be as heartless as the mom but like his big bro.", "You\u2019re not giving kids enough credit. They\u2019re not totally empty and incapable, they\u2019re little people.", "I mean my nephews just watched Coco to learn death is sad, so no I don\u2019t agree with you that you need a deep personal loss to know that death makes people sad.", "be ominous instead so she cant write him out of the will.\n\n'Speaking of happiness that someone died, I have a person of choice that I'm counting down the days for. Ah yes, soon...'\n\njk though this may land someone into the mental health hospital", "In fact I have worked with kids, both as a nanny and children\u2019s librarian for many years, before going for my PhD. A kid noticing someone acting weird is very different psychologically than them understanding that the person is acting that way because their feelings were hurt. Which is why we have to communicate to children at that age about empathy and feelings and not just expect them to know. I wasn\u2019t saying what OP did was bad, I think talking to his brother was the developmentally appropriate thing. I was simply responding to the previous comment, which stated the kid was too old to not have empathy and should know better than to say cruel things about OP\u2019s dad. At 7 the kid is right on the cusp of being able to guess how someone else is going to feel, and understand that someone will feel differently than them about the same thing. Some kids will have it at that age, most are still working on it.", "I think the most insensitive thing i said about my sister's death at 3 was \"she still feels warm to me\" at her FUNERAL. Yeah, that's basically the only thing i remembered from that entire thing and I'm glad my mother didn't hear me because i was with my great grandmother. I don't remember anything else though.", "Oh no, I think I worded something badly. I mean that him noticing that they were acting weird is much more than what a lot of books and psych lessons say they should be able to do. I took a lot of early childhood psychology heading into adolescent psychology, and I learned very quickly that many kiddos were nothing like what those lessons laid out.\n\nI agree, it is different from them acknowledging that they were acting weird because their feelings were hurt. But the fact that he did notice and asked his older sibling is more than most people would give credit to at that age. OP explaining to him why and that it was mean, in my opinion, is solidifying those connections.\n\nBut I see where I went wrong, I don't think the kid is 'too old', I agree that he is on the cusp. I think I misread what you said, I thought you were stating that they weren't able to have that skill until 7 and up, while I have seen them learn these things and be more advanced at it around 7, though it IS few and far between. Sorry, I think I got lost in my own words.\n\nI think all kids are still working at it, some adults haven't even learned those skills fully I think, but yes, some are better than others. I'm sorry for getting lost in my own words or sounding like I was belittling your education, I have horrible ADHD and my brain jumps around sometimes.", "He said their relationship was strained not abusive. She is most definitely a fucking asshole. You don't tell a mother your glad her son died, period. Unless you have evidence his dad was as shit as you're trying to make him out to be, don't even think that bullshit.", "You\u2019re fine! When I was teaching I used to spend a lot of my time explaining to my students that kids are weird, and I was teaching them what the \u201caverage kid\u201d will be thinking/feeling/doing at specific ages, but that no kid is actually that perfectly average child. (And also, most of the theories they were learning about were developed by reasonably wealthy white men with access to relatively small numbers of children, so the theories may or may not be complete bullshit. But that\u2019s a whole other can of worms.)", "He's 7. Thats young, but not too young to be informed that telling someone you're glad their son is dead is wrong.", "NtA. What what an awful thing your mom said to you. That\u2019s where your brother is getting it from.", "I'm sorry your mom is trying to erase your dad. My mother did the same when I lost my father at 16.", "NTA. You acted in a kind and honest way - he needs to understand this, and he's old enough to understand. \n\nIf he's feeling upset, it's for a lot of reasons, and you need to be there to talk it all out with him. Reassure him that he can say whatever he wants to you and you will always love him.", "NTA, he brought it up and you talked to him in a calm and kind manner about how he hurt you and your grandma. He needs to hear it so he can grow into a good human being later in life. Empathy is important and must be taught young.", "Nta what he said was cruel and unnecessary. All he did was cause pain to your grandma", "NTA - for 3 reasons:\n\n1. as a childcare practitioner it's SO important to model emotions and empathy. Children develop the beginnings of empathy at 18 months and have clearer ideas of empathy at around 3/4 years of age. He likely asked to go home because he was aware after your explanation that he hurt people he cared about unintentionally and could not yet deal with that feeling yet.\n2. You're an older sibling and that role is so different to being a parent. You did what you think is right with the information you had at the time. You are showing him that he can be honest with you and vice versa and that you can have a rational conversation despite hurt feelings.\n3. That's your dad!! \n\nMy advice: have a conversation with the little dude when you are next with but don't mention parents reaction!

I have a seven year old and there\u2019s no way she\u2019d say anything like this.", "I'm in my 30s and I don't think I could have handled it as well as OP did.  In his position I would have been furious and likely bailed with grandma so I wouldn't blow up.", "It's like half the post though? Her saying it, her rationale, and her refusing to correct her son for saying it.", "> Ever think there was a reason for her saying that?\n\nThere is zero reason to tell someone that you're glad that *one half of the couple that made them* is dead. There is no benefit to either party in that action. You know how kids can interpret that statement? \"Half of you is so awful that I'm glad it doesn't exist anymore.\"", "yeah....I still randomly think about Freud and how completely baffling his stuff is (and often warned to be a load of poop)\n\nAnd yet, every so often, I see someone reflect a sliver of his research/theories/etc and I want to cry a little", "That's cold. Telling a mom to get over her son's death.\n\nAs for your brother, his ignorance is a bit understandable. He loves his dad, and he externalizes his experience to you... why wouldn't you love the new dad? But I think he is old enough to understand, if not now then soon enough.", "NTA he\u2019s old enough to have a talk about filters but your mom needs to learn to have one around her small child because he learned that \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s dead\u201d spiel from her.", "NTA. \n\nYour mom and her new husband are assholes for letting this thought even materialize in that kid's head let alone allow him to say it out loud. Like you said, if that's the way he feels then nothing you could do about it, but there is something called compassion and being considerate. I think it's time you sat your mom down and tell her what she's doing is teaching your brother to be unkind, and while she may be happy with her current husband, her kids wouldn't exist without your dad and she better damn well remember that. \n\nYour other option would be to go LC/NC with them and just keep to your paternal grandparents to support them and grieve with them.", "NTA but your mom and stepdad definitely are!  Good for you attempting to teach your brother to have some empathy for others.", "I agree with you the 7yr old isn't an asshole. Like you say, these are really complex truths. It's hard even for adults to process feelings of being grateful that one person survived over another. The adults in his life need to be clear that it's okay to feel what he feels and that he doesn't need to feel guilty. He has to figure out how to navigate those emotions himself before he can learn how to selectively censor them in front of other people. I think OP's talk was pretty good, although he should have just said no when brother asked if he was mad. \n\nThe mom is a massive asshole.", "He's hearing that from her. She is purposely saying these things about your dad around your little brother.  She has created a younger version of her toxic self!  \n\nYour step dad may even be part of this cause either your mom is saying these things directly to your brother or mom and SD are talking about it when he's around.
