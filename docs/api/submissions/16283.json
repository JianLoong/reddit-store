Our dad died 5 years ago. Mom remarried a year later. Mom's husband adopted my brother and my brother calls him dad and loves him as his only dad. This is something everyone around us knows and while it is somewhat hard for my paternal relatives and even me, for him to have no interest in dad, we have accepted he was so little that dad was just a person he's heard about and he doesn't have an emotional attachment toward him. But a couple of weeks ago my grandparents stopped by my mom's house (I moved out) and I stopped by quickly to see them. Grandpa was out of the room for something and grandma was talking to my brother about how big he was getting. My brother was telling her all about mom's husband and how he was doing certain things. He mentioned how they were doing a special father/son trip for Father's Day and how I said no to going and how strange he found it because \"dad wants to be with his boys but OP doesn't let him be his dad\". Then he blurts out of nowhere that he's glad dad died because it meant he got his dad and he liked that he had him instead of my dad. Grandma froze and he kept talking like he'd said nothing wrong. She ended up bursting into tears and leaving. Mom asked what had happened, heard what my brother had said, and was like, oh she's just being too sensitive. I told mom he shouldn't be saying stuff like that. She said it's true and how she's glad he's dead too. I told her they might not have been happily married near the end (I think trying for a second child for years strained their marriage a lot and when my brother did arrive and cried all the time that it left them in an even worse place) but he was still the reason she had us and even if my brother never considers him a dad, he will always be my dad, and her husband did not change that. She told me it could have if I'd accepted him.\n\nMy mom made it very clear that she would not correct him for saying that. So when he wanted to hang out with me Saturday I decided to bring it up to him. He actually started the conversation saying grandma and I had acted weird when she visited. I told him that was because what he said was really hurtful and even if it is how he feels, saying that when he was her son and my dad, was not a very kind thing to do. He asked if I was mad at him and I told him I had to force myself not to be. But he had to understand that while he feels how he does, our grandparents and I love dad, and that mom's husband did not take his place. And we would never be glad he's gone. He got upset and told me he wanted to go home. So I brought him home.\n\nMom and her husband were pissed with a capital P and said it was not my place and I was putting too much on his shoulders.

Assuming you spoke to him in a calm and loving manner, it doesn't seem to me that the words you said to him were inappropriate at all.

She's the asshole here.", "NTA. Your mom is seriously flawed here. Would she like someone to tell her they wished either of her sons be dead? It is understandable that your brother loves his stepdad. That\u2019s good. But in order to raise a well-adjusted, kind, empathetic human being, your mother (and since she dropped the ball, you) must guide the younger child in learning to be sensitive. Obviously the grandparents care about your brother. He should be taught to be considerate of them.

So I don't particularly blame them for being defensive and upset. They're wrong, though.\n\nSorry, you're an adult, and this is a conflict between adults. Which is to say, you get *some* say in matters of this sort, and you have the most say when it is about something you directly witnessed and participated in, that your mother and stepfather did not.\n\nYour brother is an innocent, so I am sorry he is upset.
