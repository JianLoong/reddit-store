But just contributing to a party you are not even invited to is like being asked to provide a wedding gift while not being invited.\nDo make sure to cover your bases and let your daughter know your plans for her birthday so her father can't use the lack of financial assistance to emotionally alienate you from your daughter.", "I don\u2019t want to put her in the middle of the foolishness. And tbh I\u2019m not comfortable around his family, not all are very welcoming of me. Which is another reason why I do things with her myself, I\u2019d much rather give her the money and spend it her way."]}
