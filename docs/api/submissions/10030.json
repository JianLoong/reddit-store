My grandma died about 3 and a half years ago, and since then my mom has spiraled down towards religion. My family has always been catholic, but I was never raised with religion, and I've been an atheist since I can remember. My dad was atheist too.\n\nSo, my mom was reading the bible at the exact moment when grandma died, since then she felt closer to religion. But now she is been kinda annoying, like playing a shitty cultist christian local radio station during the day, she doesn't really listen to it, she puts it so the house is not totally silent, but when I pay attention to it the message is alarming at best, full blown hate speech at worst. Also she did an altar to my grandma and prays on it.\n\nHave I mentioned that my grandma was very verbally abusive and nobody wanted to be around her? and my mom always complained about getting verbally abused and underappreciated by her mom? Like, yeah, she was sick and suffered, im not glad she is dead but I dont miss her either.\n\nEven since grandma died my mom has been paying to organize monthly mass and prayers at a monk convent outside my city. There is no public transport there, so she need to walk a long distance, and it costs 30 dollars a month. I know americans would think that 30 dollars is nothing, but here where we live is SOMETHING, is important money.\n\nI've been calling her out on that ever since she said what the cost was for the first time, but she always brushes it off, saying is like paying for another service, but I'm like \"why dont just pray at home, for FREE?\", then she goes to \"they are self sustained and need money\" but if they needed money, they could just to the fucking vatican, they got all the money in the world, but whatever. When I spoke about it with other people they just tell me to let her be.\n\nThese last weeks ive been irritated because my job is cutting costs and our salaries are been affected and they're skipping paydays, I've been walking to work for the last 3 weeks. There is no food on the fridge and we are eating poorly. So I come home and my mom tells me that she went to the convent to pay for a mass.\n\nI blow up at her because she is paying for a cultist scam while we need food, she snaps back and deflects telling me that I would have a better pay if didn't drop out of college. I tell her that she is foolish for going there and pay other people to pray. At this point it becomes a screaming match. I tell about this to my older sister and says my mom is being ridiculous, but I feel like anyone else will just tell my mom to let it be because nobody will criticize a nun convent.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: words\n\nedit: I'm the only one who has a fulltime job in this house, she has her money but most of the money is mine, and rn I dont even have money for commuting to work.", "created_utc": 1676470519, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112yz9y/aita_calling_out_my_mom_for_paying_monthly_for/", "score": 247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom is religious and thats fine too. She is grieving and finds comfort in her faith and you shouldn't shame her for that. However, in my experience, the church never asks anyone to overextended themselves financially if they choose to give. You give what you can and that is enough. You mentioned that $30 could go a long way where you live and if your fridge is empty then your mom is spreading the finances too thinly. \n\nThe cherry on top of all of this is that you both got into a screaming match where you both tried to shame the other person for their life choices.", "As a former catholic turned atheist, YTA. While I agree that religions seem cult-like, it\u2019s none of my business (or yours) on who/what other people worship as long as their faith doesn\u2019t encourage them to do any harm to other people (I\u2019m saying this knowing that crazy people change what they\u2019ve read in religious texts to give them justification for hurting others) and it isn\u2019t being shoved down your throat. She has just as much right to believe in her version of God as much as you have the right to not believe in any. Don\u2019t be that atheist who shames others who do have faith - that makes you just as bad as the awful religious people who hatefully condemn others who don\u2019t believe, are gay, have premarital sex, or any other thing that is considered a no-no by their particular faith. \n\nIt sounds like you live in her home - if you don\u2019t like the radio station she has on all the time and you feel like the food situation isn\u2019t up to par with what you want, get a second job and move out - at 23 you\u2019re an adult and should be fully capable of taking care of yourself. I\u2019m not sure what the financial situation is in your home, but if you contribute money to the family\u2019s income, sit her down and calmly, and respectfully (if you go on attack about her faith, she will get defensive right away) and tell her that her monthly contributions to her church are taking away from the household income that you both contribute to and, as a result, the household is suffering due to this extra cost that you didn\u2019t consent to have the money you contributed to the household go to. Let her know that if it continues down this path you will have to do what is best for you and move out, thereby taking a larger chunk out of the funds she has to take care of her home. Have a calm discussion and understand that not all of your requests are going to be granted, but hopefully compromises can be made. Maybe she can only listen to her radio at a certain level/only in certain rooms/at certain times of the day and can reduce the amount of money she contributes to the church ($10 a month vs. $30 a month or donate $30 every other month). If you don\u2019t contribute financially to the household, then you don\u2019t have a say in what your mother decides to spend money on. \n\nRegarding your grandmother - I, too, had a grandmother that was an absolute horrible person. She beat her children, ignored the very clear signs that one of her children was being sexually abused, tried to control her children\u2019s lives as they got older, and was just generally an awful excuse of a human being. The day she died, I cheered when I heard that hell opened up and took back one of its own. That being said, her children mourned her and continue to do so to this day. I didn\u2019t get it when she died and I still don\u2019t get it to this day, but it was NEVER my place to tell my parent/aunts/uncle how they were supposed to mourn. Perhaps your mother is mourning the loss of the kind of relationship she had always wished she had with her mother, perhaps she regrets the things she should\u2019ve told your mother (whether good or bad), but never got up enough courage to do so, or, maybe she has chosen to remember the really good parts of her life that included her mother who sounds like she was less than perfect. She doesn\u2019t owe you an explanation on why she feels the need to set up an alter for her flawed mother. I\u2019m sad for your mother, and for you, that you can\u2019t let her have her alter in peace and respect her need (for whatever reason her need exists) to have it in her own home.", "YTA. You don't have to like it, but she's an adult. She can do whatever she wants with her money. Your opinion one whether or not this is a scam is irrelevant. She's clearly doing this because it gives her comfort from her grief, and you \"calling her out\" for this is just gross.", "OP, please please be careful.  I vote NTA, just to get it out of the way, but hear my out.  I had a similar experience to you. My gram was the same way; Bible this and religion that.  If I spoke out against it in ANY way (mostly me telling her to turn off that awful Christian TV station bc it gave me a headache) it would end in a screaming match.   I was shunned and made to be the black sheep of the family. She too would give all her money to the church and rely on us for meals. When she died EVERYTHING was left to the church.   I loved the \u201cI told you so\u201d moment when my family found that out. No one believed me that she was falling victim to, what I called, the brainwashing cult.   \n\nYour mom is grieving and this is how she is coping with that grief.  She can\u2019t see the logic you are putting in front of her.  You\u2019re basically talking to a brick wall. Therapy is an option but I fear she will brush off your concerns and not go. You need to try and get through to her that the families basic needs must be met before she throws away this money.  Can your father help?  I\u2019m sorry she is acting like this.", "It appears that more information would be required. Is your mom using your money? Does she work? If she is using your money to do this - NTA, if it's her own then YTA. Have the discussion about setting a budget and give control of the money to you or your dad  If she doesn't have access, she can't spend it. \nWhen it comes to religion, though, let her be. She is grieving. It may seem ridiculous and irrational to you, but that doesn't negate the comfort your mother is getting from it. Since her mother was abusive, perhaps she is struggling with guilt for idly wishing her dead. In any case, it doesn't matter why, this is the crutch she feels she needs now, please stop trying to kick it out from under her. Also, there are plenty of Christian radio stations, find a better one.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get a say in how she uses her own money.

I would recommend trying to change the radio to one of those.\n3. Is there a closer church that doesn\u2019t ask for $$.  If yes, see if you can get her to check it out.\n\nLook, i realize you are anti-religion and from on vague comment you made it sounds like you have a very good reason to be but this isn\u2019t about you.  It\u2019s about saving your mom from cult like version of the religion (yes, yes people can argue that all of the catholic church is a cult but i believe there are still shades of grey here).
