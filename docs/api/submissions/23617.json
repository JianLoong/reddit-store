But things have changed since I recently found out I was pregnant. She\u2019s been wanting a baby for a really long time but is infertile & when I broke the exciting news to her, her reaction was that of a jealous enemy. She asked \u201cwhat are you going to do are you going to keep it?\u201d \u201cAre you sure you can look after it?\u201d She even went as far as to say \u201cit might be nice news for you, but it would be better news for someone who is infertile\u201d making me feel guilty for having a baby and I started having crazy thoughts that perhaps she wanted me to give it to her? I tried to brush it off but the longer my pregnancy has gone on, the weirder it has become. Being my bestfriend, I figured I would invite her to my baby shower but since then, she has gone as far as to hold and sniff my stomach, and says things like \u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet her, im going to take such good care of her\u201d. It was creepy, but when it got really odd was a week ago when I went to visit her house & noticed she had cleared out her office & was setting up a new room, she was mid unwrapping a cot when I walked in and asked her what the room was for and she said \u201cjust incase one day I\u2019m a mother\u201d and smiled & looked at my stomach.\nIt\u2019s getting a bit too strange for me and I\u2019m not sure I feel comfortable having her at my baby shower so I\u2019ve sent a text to her saying it\u2019s called off. But it\u2019s not! And I know she will see the photos on social media\u2026 I just don\u2019t know what else to say but I don\u2019t really want her around my baby.

You need to make her understand that it's YOUR baby and not hers. And you need to do it before the baby shower, or things will only be worse.\n\nHer words are concerning, and I would have put a stop ages ago. If she's talking as if its also 'her baby', she would make your life hell. I can picture her wanting to be in the birth room with you, or calling CPS on you.\nSo please, you need to protect you and your child.\n\nFor me, I would going LC/NC and if she reacts aggressively or threateningly, a restraining order or even the police can be a solution. \nMaybe I'm too extreme, but I can't picture her understanding your boundaries.\nSo you need to do something ASAP.", "NTA\n\nnope, im sorry but i would completely cut off contact from her. i\u2019d be absolutely paranoid that she\u2019d try to steal your kid too. please get a security system and baby cam in preparation for this baby. this is not sitting right with me at all.\n\nngl: i would almost convince her that i\u2019m no longer having the baby so she hops off. idk, maybe thats too extreme, i don\u2019t like this though and am praying that all stays okay for you & baby.", "NTA be safe op. There was a case where a woman gutted her friend and killed her and the baby trying to take the baby for her own. She was crazy obviously", "Nope!! NTA. I\u2019ve read sooo many stories of women trying to steal babies, sometimes before the baby is even born. \n\nPlease keep yourself safe and tell people around you what is happening and what you are feeling", "That does sound creepy and I would definitely be worried. She may be on the verge of a mental breakdown and in need of some serious help. There are some definite red flags there. I\u2019d be careful around her if I were you. Get some distance asap.", "NTA.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet, PLEASE make sure other people you trust are aware of this situation. Also I would tell you your doctor and the L&D staff when you go into labor to make sure she\u2019s kept away.\n\nStay safe.", "She's not your best friend, and I would suggest cutting off all contact with her and blocking her on all socials.\n\nNTA and stay safe.", "She sounds unhinged and I suggest you keep her away from you and away from the baby, and if she is around, never allow her to be alone with you and the baby. Trust your instincts. NTA", "Oh God keep well away.  Do not let her in your house. Do not meet her anywhere. Do not have any contact.  Do not tell her when you in labour.\na\nAnyone who thinks you overreacting,  show them news clips or videos of snatched babys.", "Eeeek...I'd be creeped out as hell too. No I would avoid her for sure. Idk all I can think of is those true crime shows where the crazy lady steals someone elses baby because she can't have one and has gone total psycho. Not saying that would happen but, eeek. NTA", "I don't mean to scare you OP but this is really unhinged behavior. I saw this true crime episode once of people who actually cut up women in their last stages of pregnancy and stole the babies (and left the women to die). Please be careful. Tell others in your life close to you about what's been going on and under no circumstances be alone with her either at your place or hers or anywhere else. \nNTA But this is way more serious than simply if you're an AH or not.", "Don\u2019t let her around your kid and idk how you\u2019d go about warning doctors but it sounds like she\u2019s not well in the head right maybe try and help but above all else keep you and your child safe before helping her", "Currently pregnant. My experience so far has been that pregnancy makes other women crazy. It\u2019s wild. You need to protect yourself and your child.\n\nLet someone close to your friend know what has been happening so that your friend can receive the help they need. The source of help shouldn\u2019t be from you at this stage.", "NTA. You need to circle the wagons. You ARE in danger, this is not normal behavior. Contact her family and ask them to intervene and let them know you need to cut her off for your child's and possibly your own safety. Contact your support system and let them know she is showing increasingly erratic behavior and she is not to have contact with you or baby. She gets no second chances. This has the capacity to go EXTREMELY bad, extremely quickly. You have to decide now, your baby or your friend. You don't get a second chance if you UNDER react, so if this all an overreaction, so be it. Better to overreact and apologize than under react and end up the next breaking news story.", "NTA. Listen.. I'm not trying to scare you but warn you. In my town a woman had a friend who did and said similar things. She killed the woman and cut her baby out of her.  Right after she had taken her to lunch  and treated her to a day of shopping.\n\nI'm not trying to scare you or offend anyone... But this stuff happens and the story sounds so much like it, I just want you to know.", "Stay away stay far away, she\u2019s sending major creepy vibes!", "NTA\n\nFriend is definitely giving off creepy vibes. \n\nIf you have any text messages, emails, video, audio recordings of any of this make copies and leave one set with a trusted friend or family member. I\u2019d get a security system (cameras, lights, window alarms) & a video/speaker doorbell. If your soon to be ex-friend has ever had a copy of your house key change the locks. Make sure you have deadbolts on all doors the lead to the exterior. Once you break up with bestie do not open the door talk to her only through the doorbell cam so you can be safer and have video if she gets further or blatantly unhinged. If any neighbors have a key to your place for emergencies give them a picture of your friend and let them know she\u2019s not a friend anymore and should never be let into your home.\n\nHave some friends keep a lookout in case ex-bestie tries to crash the baby shower.\nSince you know she\u2019ll see the pictures of the baby shower be upfront, say in a calm voice that her behavior has been concerning  & she\u2019s not invited anymore. In fact, you are ending your friendship. Maybe have a third party with you when you do these things as a witness just in case. If she tries to argue or weasel her way out \u201cit\u2019s a joke or you misunderstood\u201d say \u201cI am not talking about this any more with you\u201d and calmly walk away.\nBlock/remove her from all your social media you may have. If you have any friends in common you might want to hold off on sharing announcements or baby images in case she can see the news/images from mutual friends feed or if they comment.\n\nAsk your gynecologist to put a password lock on your records so she can\u2019t call them, pretend to be you and try to get information from your records or when your appointments are. If they ask why you can explain. When it comes time to give birth let the nurses know this ex-friend (name & picture) are not allowed anywhere near you or your bundle of joy. \n\nIf you know of friend\u2019s family and you feel comfortable reaching out to them perhaps you could share your concerns about her with them.", "NTA. Trust your instincts. It's better to lose a friend than have something happen to baby.", "NTA she is your friend and you know her best. If this seems super creepy and you feel like the situation isn\u2019t safe then go LC for a bit.", "NTA. Motherly instinct is a real thing and let\u2019s be honest this isn\u2019t just a gut feeling the red flags are popping left and right. Your BFF might be going through some rough mental issues if she is acting this way but your priority is keeping your baby safe. I\u2019d say stay away and if at any point she wants to talk with you and you choose to meet with her (which I probably wouldn\u2019t) do it with someone else you trust being with you and in a public space. Stay safe, her behavior is not okay.", "Nooooo, NTA at all. She\u2019s crazy and will 100% try to steal your baby however she can. Get away from her immediately and tell people around you about what she\u2019s doing. Her comments plus her setting up a nursery? Nope, not just a red flag anymore.", "NTA/HOWEVER: nta, however, instead of lying, just be honest. confront her about her behavior. advise her she has been acting strange, and just tell her how u feel.\ni mean your going to have to deal with the situation reguardless, as u said she will see on social media. mine as well rip the band aid off now. \n\ngood luck and b safe, sounds creepy", "Gong to her down voted  to hell for this but I speak the truth based on decades of personal experience\u2026 90% of infertile women are batshit insane - please do not allow this person around you or your baby alone, at any point in time.", "Is she a bully?
