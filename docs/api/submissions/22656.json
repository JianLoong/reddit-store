{"id": 22656, "submission_id": "153yay4", "title": "WIBTA for kicking out my husbands cousin along with his girlfriend and baby even if they'll be homeless?", "selftext": "My husband and I recently moved in to my MIL's old house, which we inherited after her passing. His cousin was already there when we moved in (an effort by his father to give the cousin a chance to get on his feet after getting out of jail), though they were told they'd have to move out before we moved in, they said they weren't in a position yet to do so. They weren't really causing any problems around the house, so we decided to continue to allow them to stay  until they got on their feet. Now, my MIL specifically stated when she kicked out the cousin the first time that she did not want him back, let alone to allow a girlfriend to move in but when we got there they were already there and she was pregnant, so we'd have felt bad allowing her to become homeless while pregnant. \n\nFast forward to February, six months later, and they were still there, meaning that, combined with the time they lived there before we moved in, they had been there for a year. They now had a newborn baby and were fighting, constantly. We have a young child ourselves and we didn't want her to have to keep witnessing this, so we gave them 90 days to get some money together and find somewhere else to stay, to which the cousin's response was to scoff and say that there was no way they'd be able to get enough money together by then to move, especially since they still needed to get a vehicle. They had done nothing up to this point to progress towards that, in fact, the cousin didn't find a job until my husband threatened to throw them out. 90 days came and went and to this day (over 2 months after the 90 days), there is still no sign of them moving out. The girlfriend has been cancelling job interviews whenever she gets them, and they have continued to fight, daily. If they're not sleeping, they're fighting. \n\nShe will spend the day sleeping and ignoring the baby, then hand the baby to him the moment he walks in the door, at which point the fighting starts. She says she's tired from taking care of the baby all day, and he says he just needs five minutes to wash up, at which point she begins to yell at him. I'm trying to stay out of their business, but these fights are occurring in our living room and our child shares a wall with the living room. I feel like we've given them more than enough of a chance to get on our feet and it's about time to have some peace in the house. \n\nHere's where I might be the A-hole. No one else in the family wants to take them in after hearing how they are in our house and after the behavior displayed while they've stayed with other family members for holidays, so if they get kicked out, that baby will be living in a tent along with them, and that thought alone brings tears to my eyes, but I don't know how much more of my peace, and more importantly my child's peace I can sacrifice for this baby to not have to go homeless.", "created_utc": 1689780787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153yay4/wibta_for_kicking_out_my_husbands_cousin_along/", "score": 285, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
