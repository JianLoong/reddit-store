He proceeded to tell me he had a friend that worked in a jewellery shop that could get me a discount. I accepted it as a great idea considering how expensive engagement rings can be. \n\nA few weeks later I met my dad at the jewellery shop where he was looking at engagement rings and the lady behind the counter was trying them on to show him which I found a little strange. but I didn\u2019t really think much of it at the time. \n\nAfter purchasing the ring and proposing to my girlfriend (she said yes) I realised the name of the lady who served me sounded familiar, I talked to my brother and his girlfriend about it and we did some digging. We found her name on the receipt and realised it was the lady who my dad was having an affair with when he was with my mum which was the final straw for her to leave him. This lady is also written in his will for our family to accept her and her two children as our family if my dad was to pass away. \n\nBesides the night my older brother and my mum confronted him about him paying another mortgage and putting together that he was having an affair he has never brought her up and has never introduced her to any of us. This confrontation happened just over 2 years ago but she is still clearly in his life in some capacity. \n\nThe ring needed to get resized as I was set on a proposal date and I wasn\u2019t able to get one her size in time for that date. About a week after the proposal we were on our way to the shops to get the ring resized when I received a call from my dad. He was asking if we were able to hold off on getting the ring resized for another week as it would affect his \u2018friends\u2019 bonus, I told him that we can do that but we continued to the shops to get it resized that day anyways. \n\nI know that it was dumb to say yes then go and do the opposite of that but I didn\u2019t think it was okay to have to make my fianc\u00e9 wait to wear her engagement ring just because my dad wants his \u2018friend\u2019 to get a bonus at work.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: With questions regarding the ring, we live in another state to where we purchased the ring but was with the same company. When we went to get it resized we were informed they had to remake the ring completely which came with a new set of documents which we were very happy about as my dads mistress\u2019 name was not on the new receipt so the new ring had nothing to do with her.", "created_utc": 1676457612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112v535/aita_for_getting_my_fianc\u00e9s_engagement_ring/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And honestly even if it does, why the hell should you give a damn? Zero sympathy for the homewrecker. And your dad is a major AH for... everything.", "NTA.  That doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, about the bonus. The sale was already made.  But I have never worked in a jewelry store.\n\nOkay, he will learn that you had it resized that day anyway.  Obviously your fianc\u00e9 was with you in the car, and she wanted it resized that day.  Wife trumps father in this instance.", "NTA\n\nYou want your fianc\u00e9e to wear a ring that fits so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to be resized however I don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re so calm over this\n\nIf my father had pulled that kind of stunt on me I would of cancelled the sale, Put him in his place for being disrespectful and found the same or similar ring at another jewellery store \n\nBest of luck OP, Hope everything else runs smoothly", "NTA- Your father didn't care for your mothers/brothers or your well being when he was cheating on your mother.  Why should you care for what he wants.  Plus based on what you said it seems that you dad might still support her.", "NTA. Usually I'd think it's pretty shitty to lie and just do it anyway but there's clearly some wounds regarding this woman which haven't healed yet and I think, in the grand scheme of things, this is pretty minor.\n\nI am curious; how exactly can someone force the family to accept this woman and her kids in a will. I understand him leaving her money but I'd love to know who the emotional component is phrased in a legal document. Or is it just a request?", "Dad's an ass. You're not.\nThe only way I can see the mistress losing commission is if she was off the day you wanted it resized, as they often get a cut of work as well as sales. And as for mistress losing commission, not your circus, not your monkey.", "NTA very weird pseudo-tense situation but nta.", "NTA. Ideally you'd just have been honest and said no, you're getting it resized, but this is a really tough situation to navigate and I think your lie is a real minor infraction in this circumstance. I hope you advise your Father as such should you receive any pushback.\n\nI don't quite understand how it'll affect her commission though. Engagement rings get resized all the time. It shouldn't affect the initial sale at all.", "NTA. But, the issue may really be that it's not about a bonus. She may have gotten you a huge discount, but it needed to wait a week for who knows what, but you negated that. Oopsie. She may be out of a job now. But it's your dad's fault for being a liar in the first place.", "NTA this whole situation sounds crazy to me, I would be more than a little annoyed if my dad used me to get his mistress a sale without pre warning! He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t return it and get a completely new one in the first place.", "NTA He's hoping that things don't work out with your fianc\u00e9e and the ring will end up on his AP's finger", "NTA affair or not, jeweler's bonus is not your concern.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How do you know about your dad\u2019s will if you only just met this other woman and connected the dots?

By doing that in the next month, she could sell the first ring, give that money back to him and she would have gotten the bonus twice", "It\u2019s a request in his will which I think is totally fucked up.", "They can\u2019t really force them, but requests to do things that can\u2019t be enforced are pretty common in wills.  People want to get a last word in on something, so you see things like demands that no one give so-and-so the secret family recipe, or requests that this person care for that person (or pet, or garden, etc).  Or telling people to use an RV or a boat to go to a particular place and remember them.\n\nPeople can get real weird in wills.  If the lawyer who prepared the will is remotely decent, they know there\u2019s nothing to enforce that kind of thing (unless it\u2019s a \u201cyou must do/not do X to inherit <whatever>\u201c clause - many but not all of those are enforceable).", "I get your point, but I disagree that there is no obligation. Anyone knowingly starting an affair with a married person is just being a shitty human being. We all have an obligation not to be shitty human beings.", "If a single person knows the other person is in a relationship, they definitely share some blame in the destruction of the relationship.", "I'd do it just on principle. Dad's homewrecker shouldn't benefit from this in any way at all imo. I'd return that ring so fast... Dad has some damn nerve.", "Yeah, I agree. If it's not tied to some condition of your inheritance then if you don't want to then don't do it.", "He can request all he wants, but he can't make you do it.", "Yeah. Me too.\n\nEspecially because the dad is trying to grease her paycheck.\n\nLeaving money in the will is one thing (understandable if those are his kids, I guess,) but demanding they be treated as family? Fuck no.", "You totally know dad is going to want to bring the homewrecker to the wedding as his date", "50:50 he comes at all, now.\n\n\nI never understood why anyone would trust a guy in an exclusive relationship that *started* as an affair.
