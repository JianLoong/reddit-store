We found her name on the receipt and realised it was the lady who my dad was having an affair with when he was with my mum which was the final straw for her to leave him. This lady is also written in his will for our family to accept her and her two children as our family if my dad was to pass away. \n\nBesides the night my older brother and my mum confronted him about him paying another mortgage and putting together that he was having an affair he has never brought her up and has never introduced her to any of us.

About a week after the proposal we were on our way to the shops to get the ring resized when I received a call from my dad.

That doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, about the bonus. The sale was already made.  But I have never worked in a jewelry store.\n\nOkay, he will learn that you had it resized that day anyway.  Obviously your fianc\u00e9 was with you in the car, and she wanted it resized that day.  Wife trumps father in this instance.", "NTA\n\nYou want your fianc\u00e9e to wear a ring that fits so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to be resized however I don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re so calm over this\n\nIf my father had pulled that kind of stunt on me I would of cancelled the sale, Put him in his place for being disrespectful and found the same or similar ring at another jewellery store \n\nBest of luck OP, Hope everything else runs smoothly", "NTA- Your father didn't care for your mothers/brothers or your well being when he was cheating on your mother.  Why should you care for what he wants.  Plus based on what you said it seems that you dad might still support her.", "NTA. Usually I'd think it's pretty shitty to lie and just do it anyway but there's clearly some wounds regarding this woman which haven't healed yet and I think, in the grand scheme of things, this is pretty minor.\n\nI am curious; how exactly can someone force the family to accept this woman and her kids in a will. I understand him leaving her money but I'd love to know who the emotional component is phrased in a legal document. Or is it just a request?", "Dad's an ass. You're not.\nThe only way I can see the mistress losing commission is if she was off the day you wanted it resized, as they often get a cut of work as well as sales. And as for mistress losing commission, not your circus, not your monkey.", "NTA very weird pseudo-tense situation but nta.", "NTA. Ideally you'd just have been honest and said no, you're getting it resized, but this is a really tough situation to navigate and I think your lie is a real minor infraction in this circumstance. I hope you advise your Father as such should you receive any pushback.\n\nI don't quite understand how it'll affect her commission though. Engagement rings get resized all the time. It shouldn't affect the initial sale at all.", "NTA. But, the issue may really be that it's not about a bonus. She may have gotten you a huge discount, but it needed to wait a week for who knows what, but you negated that. Oopsie. She may be out of a job now. But it's your dad's fault for being a liar in the first place.", "NTA this whole situation sounds crazy to me, I would be more than a little annoyed if my dad used me to get his mistress a sale without pre warning! He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t return it and get a completely new one in the first place.", "NTA He's hoping that things don't work out with your fianc\u00e9e and the ring will end up on his AP's finger", "NTA affair or not, jeweler's bonus is not your concern.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People want to get a last word in on something, so you see things like demands that no one give so-and-so the secret family recipe, or requests that this person care for that person (or pet, or garden, etc).  Or telling people to use an RV or a boat to go to a particular place and remember them.\n\nPeople can get real weird in wills.  If the lawyer who prepared the will is remotely decent, they know there\u2019s nothing to enforce that kind of thing (unless it\u2019s a \u201cyou must do/not do X to inherit <whatever>\u201c clause - many but not all of those are enforceable).", "I get your point, but I disagree that there is no obligation.

You should not need to remake a ring to size it - there are very few styles that require that (tension settings are typically done to size because of the metal tempering you need to secure the stone, but that's about it).\n\nA standard engagement ring, and frankly rings in general - should be sizable (within reason). Unless you were off by like 4-5 sizes, which I doubt you were (this sort of big resize is most common with Estate Rings that are 75+ years old), something is weird here. Even eternity bands are sizable - it's inconvenient, but it's doable. \n\nI'm honestly very curious what happened here that they decided to remake your ring - you're NTA, but I'd be very suspicious and have an independent appraisal done by a graduate gemologist once you get your ring. \n\nBest of luck & congrats on your engagement!", "So much unnecessary backstory that somehow got you alot of NTA.\n\nLast time I checked, lying is considered to be a dick move.

And honestly, if it was me I'd have aborted the whole transaction as soon as I realized who the saleslady was, and shopped somewhere else.\n\nNow you're going to have a ring on your wife's finger that will remind you of your father's \"other family\" that destroyed your own ... every day of your marriage.\n\nNo discount is worth that, IMHO.", "NTA your dad is!", "NTA but damn, your dad is a piece of work, and that's a shady lady, although it seems like maybe she was trying to be helpful.

Yeah, whatever Dad had in mind, OP just did his own thing.", "I was thinking along similar lines that it could be a ploy to do the sale twice. Since OP said they had to fully remake the ring to resize, and there was a new \"sale\" for that to happen: I think it's possible dad and gf knew this & tried to only show or point out rings that this would be the case for. They wanted OP to come in and do the resizing with the gf, so she could get the second documented sale on her job performance record. My guess is the gf wasn't working that day, so the Dad wanted OP to wait for the gf to be on shift before he went to resize so OP would do it with her.", "Obviously talk to a lawyer. But likely it is not enforceable. Being friends or accepting someone is not something you can enforce via contract.", "Or  someone who is a home wrecker in another relationship.", "The point you made about the discount makes sense. Although of course you can get your own rings resized but they would be doing it in another state which would be suspicious to the company I would think.", "And if it is tied to something with the inheritance, you might be able to have it set aside in probate. It\u2019s worth a conversation with the probate lawyer.", "Lol, I hear ya! :D"]}
