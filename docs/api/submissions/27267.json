And if the people don\u2019t \u2018banter\u2019 back, do they call them liars?", "Again, personality is important in finding someone handsome. So you can look alike and still find one of the 2 ugly (as ugly as their personality).\n\nAnd if it was such a \u2018fun\u2019 joke, why would several people who were there call OP an AH?", "Because she answered him and as he didn\u2019t like the answer, he called her a liar.\n\nMaking one bad taste joke that get a final answer has nothing to do with bantering (she shot him down, she was not joking back).\n\nInsisting that someone is lying  because their answer doesn\u2019t please you is pathetic.\n\nActing this way to your brother\u2019s gf and insisting she has to be attracted to him is creepy.\n\nEdit: he even called her a liar in the title!", "Answering to someone asking you something is called politeness not bantering back. He asked, she answered. And actually it was some of the other people who told him she was uncomfortable.\n\nAnd his answer to her refuting she found him attractive was disgusting, immature and disrespectful (who calls someone a liar at third meeting, over personal taste?)", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Absolutely incorrect. Handsome is merely an assessment of physical beauty. Heterosexual people can acknowledge that someone of the same sex is handsome or pretty without feeling attracted to them.\n\nAs I said, before, attraction is more emotional or sexual. That is when the mind is stimulated and wants to take it further. I\u2019ve also seen beautiful women who were not my type. I did not feel any attraction towards them, but could acknowledge their physical beauty.\n\nThis may come as a heavy shock to you, but I have often been called handsome, but incompatible in the personality department\ud83d\ude42", "He never claimed that she was attracted to him. He said \u201chandsome.\u201dAttraction implies emotional and/or sexual desire.

Important thing is that she answer he was not her type (which could mean a lot of things, such as she doesn\u2019t find either of them particularly \u2018handsome\u2019 but is attracted to the good twin) and he called her a liar. So he considers she cannot say he is not handsome, and that she cannot be attracted to his brother if she doesn\u2019t find evil twin handsome (attraction is mentioned in one of OP\u2019s comment)", "You are as clueless as him: banter implies 2 people going back and forth and enjoying the exchange.\n\nThis exchange is him doing a distasteful joke, her ending the discussion and then him calling her a liar.\nIt is NOT banter.\n\nAnd in another comment he wrote that if you are not physically attracted to someone then you are settling for them. So in his mind, she is his brother\u2019s gf so she is attracted to his brother, and as a consequence she is attracted to him\u2026 Creepy! \nLook OP\u2019s ridiculous comments.", "Same in denmark", "You\u2019re just mad that I don\u2019t agree with you lol.

He just went \"ehhh, not bad huh!?\" and pointed back and forth between them at me. Of course I laughed, because it was a foreign uncle joke (he's super Russian) and that was it. No continuation, no need for it. This example is... different. When you say that sort of thing to your *same aged* twin brothers girlfriend, it can definitely be construed differently. \n\nI'm going to go YTA but soft because you could just be an old Russian uncle in a young man's body.", "He is such a nice guy tho. So sad good guys like him nowadays get no recognition. With a killing humor on top as well. Such a shame", "How do you know that's how this is coming off? It seems genuinely not that at all. It's a pretty innocent and honest situation. I even miss things in social aspects that maybe he does too, so call him the asshole for that reasoning is a bit much on my opinion.

If anything we both try not to draw attention to us. I think being twins and everyone almost making comments about us looking alike we both are very quiet and reserve. \n\nAnd we would never do above what the OP did. So YTA", "Also I feel like if girlfriend was bantering back she would have gone for a straight up insult?\n\nLike asking if he's as handsome as his brother isn't a joke on its own, it's the *setup* for a joke. The punchline is girlfriend insulting OP, ideally in a way that's funny because he and his brother are twins. \"You're not my type\" is actually sort of a good start to that?\n\nPoint is OP should have been prepared for a return shot.", "Which is probably why the gf firmly replied that he\u2019s not her type instead of laughing it off. She sensed sus vibes", "Your brother sounds like a real nice guy. I can see why he has a gf and you don\u2019t. He didn\u2019t even embarrass you in front of your friends and called you hitting on his gf \u201cshowing off\u201d instead of what it really was. And waited til you guys were alone to tell you how he really felt. Sounds very considerate, which is the opposite of how you sound.", "You are the one saying inappropriate things to his girlfriend.

Clearly you gotta be an alright looking dude if your brother is out here winning with the ladies. Too bad that\u2019ll still never get you laid because you opening your mouth is the most effective birth control that\u2019s ever existed.

Luigi actually loves his brother and wouldn't be harassing Peach about something like this!", "I mean, he also seems to have missed that even the most identical of twins aren't *completely* identical in *every* way unless it's being used as a creepy factor in a horror movie, so...probably not?", "I remember when I as a German went to England the first time at 11 years old.
