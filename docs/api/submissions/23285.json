{"id": 23285, "submission_id": "15b8z40", "title": "AITA for laughing when my brothers crashed a car?", "selftext": "I (18F) crashed a car shortly after I got my license, about 5 months after. It was January 2022 and I spun out on black ice while going around a curve (yes, even going 15ish mph under the speed limit because I was TERRIFIED of driving in the winter). There were cars coming and any training I ever received for spinning out fled my mind, so I crashed into a cement bridge wall.\n\nThe car had 450,000 miles on it and was still in good condition, we got it for a very low price as well. When I crashed, I broke/bent something similar to the tire axel but I forget what it's called because I'm not super car savvy. I managed to not pop the radiator, but I busted the right front pretty bad. The car no longer drove correctly.\n\nMy brothers (20M \"Lucas\" and 15M \"Brandon\") refuse to let me live this down, continuously claiming that I should've been going even slower, that my lack of skills ruined a perfectly good car and that they would never trust me to drive them anywhere because I'll crash and kill them. They aren't necessarily wrong with the first 2, but even my parents don't bring it up because they too have ruined a car before.\n\nThe most recent incident of my brothers bringing up me crashing this car was yesterday when we were talking about how I'm driving down to our vacation spot (a 5 hour drive) by myself because of work reasons. I told them to let it go and that a) it's summer time, b) I'm more experienced now (I know, I know, not by much), and c) I've driven alone 4 hours one way before. They laughed and just said stuff along the lines of \"We'll see ya with the tow truck!\" and \"How do you plan on crashing this one?\"\n\nBrandon has a supercharged 2000s car that he is in love with. He and Lucas drive it around at high speeds for fun sometimes. It apparently can take curves really well! I'm not 100% sure what happened, but the car ended up on its side in a ditch. Both brothers walked away with minor injuries.\n\nWhen I heard my parents and brothers talking about this I started laughing at my brothers and asked them how the tow truck was. My parents got mad at me and called me insensitive. Brandon called me a dickhead because he really cared about his car and now it needs a ton of repairs (he listed them but I wasn't really listening atp). When I said he should stop bringing up my crash then, he said that what happened with him wasn't even his fault so I don't get to laugh but my crash was my fault and is therefore \"a massive L\" and \"negative skills.\"\n\nMy parents have taken my car keys (they own the car I have but I'm paying them back for it) because I apparently hurt Brandon's feelings and made him upset and now I feel like a jerk, but I also don't think it's fair? My friends are kind of split.\n\n*Also idk if I should add but this is an approved repost <3", "created_utc": 1690481395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15b8z40/aita_for_laughing_when_my_brothers_crashed_a_car/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Karma is a bitch.\n\nBut I really don't understand why your parents are punishing you for laughing at your brother ? did they ever punish your brothers when they laughed at you? Not fair.", "NTA\n\nI think your response and reaction was perfectly justified.  I believe the term is \"karma\"!\n\nYour parents are TA here for a). taking it out on you, and b). knowingly tolerating the reckless high-speed driving you're citing and which resulted in the incident.", "NTA - crashing due to black ice is NOT indicative of skill. Crashing in a turn while driving at a high speed IS indicative of skill. He's the one with the L on this, not you. Your parents are wrong and supported him bullying you with his teasing yet come down on you hard when you speak up for yourself. That's a bunch of crap.", "NTA. \n\nYou hadn't even been a licensed driver for half a year when you crashed your car. And it's not like experience would have saved you. I know a few people in my family with years of driving experience under their belts that have gotten into crashes because of icy roads. You were even going 15 under the speed limit. Your brother on the other hand was deliberately driving recklessly and irresponsibly. It's no surprise that it ended up crashing like it did. Brandon is being a baby over this because you \"hurt his feelings\". And the fact that your parents are PUNISHING you over this makes it clear that they favor Brandon over you in some way.", "NTA! You could have died, black ice is scary. They were probably messing around in their car. Yes it's scary, they could have gotten really hurt too. Maybe you should have waited. But they bullied you for a looong time about something that wasn't even in your control. Don't dish it if you can't take it.", "You are correct, it's not fair that Brandon has made fun of you for your accident for well over a year now. But he can't handle being made fun of in return? For an accident that probably was his fault because he has a history of driving his supercharged car at high speeds? NTA", "NTA your brother is a baby, and your parents are even bigger ones. \"Massive L\" \"Negative skills\" really? I can't speak for everyone but those are things you say when your friend gets a voice crack, not when someone hurts your feelings. And your parents took your keys for laughing ONE TIME? Your brothers have been doing this for over a year now, did your parents punish them too? From what I can tell, you probably wouldn't even have laughed if your brothers didn't taunt you first. Is this a one time thing or have you been punished like this before? Please consider showing this post to your parents, it sounds like they need a wake up call.", "NTA, your brothers need to suck it up and deal with after giving you so much shit for your accident. Your parents also suck for taking your keys away.", "NTA- but I would ask my parents this... why do you allow him to ridicule me without so much as a comment for years, but when the worm turns, I am grounded?  Are you trying to teach me that his feelings matter but mine don't?  Because lesson learned", "Brandon\u2019s a baby. It\u2019s his fault. He lost control  of his car due to lack of driving skill. Poor baby. Start calling him crash. Has he always been your parents favorite?  Time to move out soon.", "NTA. Classic case of don't dish it out if you can't take it. Glad everyone is okay, but I would have laughed too. Karma sucks!", "NTA. sucks to suck", "NTA. You're certainly not the AH here. What goes around, comes around. And if, after a 1-1/2 years of giving you sh\\*t about your accident, they can't take one single comment, then they need to get off their high horse. As for your parents, I appreciate that they didn't bring up your accident but they did allow your brothers to harass you. If that's because they figure they're not going to get involved in sibling bickering, that's fine (although really, there should come a time when a parent says, that's enough because that sh\\*t gets old). But for them to punish you for one comment is grossly unfair. Maybe you were a jerk for laughing, but they've been jerks for OVER A YEAR with no repercussions. Brandon needs to pull his big boy panties on. And your parents need to rethink their stance on taking your keys away for a single comment and perhaps think about whether they play favorites consciously or unconsciously.", "NTA karma is a bitch! What goes around comes around, and they all should have seen your reaction coming. Hopefully this situation will make them think twice about teasing you for such thing.", "NTA. The difference between you and your brothers car accident was your was caused by weather. His was caused by him being reckless and speeding. When black ice is present, it is dangerous and very few things can be done to avoid an accident from it, even if you are going as slow as you can be. \n\nYour brothers are AHs and so are your parents. Did your parents ever punish them for laughing at you for the car crash you were in? If not, then they favor your brothers. Also why would a 15 year old be given a supercharged car? I\u2019m assuming your in the US which means he just got his permit is still learning to drive and he already likes to speed a car he obviously can\u2019t control. He\u2019s gonna kill someone if he continues to drive like this", "NTA  How was the accident not his fault?", "NTA Probably shouldn\u2019t have laughed but the accident likely was his own fault. Black ice is not usually anyone\u2019s fault. I\u2019ve hit black ice twice in my life and been lucky that (a) I was going slow and (b) there were no other cars around at the time. You have zero control until a wheel is off the ice.", "NTA also your brothers are potential murderers and shouldn't drive cars at all.", "NTA.\n\n>  My parents have taken my car keys (they own the car I have but I'm paying them back for it)   \n   \nTell your parents to give you the keys back, or the money you have given them.  If they don't, take every key of theirs, and don't take the cars, but hide the keys where they won't ever find them.  Bury them in a hole if you have to.   \n    \nYour brother was reckless and destroyed their car, and now, they get a taste of their own medicine, tell your parents to butt out since they refused to step up to your brother's being AHs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm really curious because I'd love to know what model can keep going and be in decent condition after 450,000 miles.

Also I\u2019m curious about what caused your brother\u2019s crash that\u2019s \u201cnot his fault\u201d. Because black ice caused your crash and that\u2019s not your fault. Even as an experienced driver, black ice is really difficult to navigate. You weren\u2019t able to respond to the black ice and avoid crashing, he couldn\u2019t avoid the other car or animal and also crashed. He\u2019s at least as much at fault as you were. \n\nLastly, you should sit your parents down and discuss their favoritism. They never punished him for hurting your feelings (repeatedly) and yet they punish you for the same. I would ask point blank when they plan to punish him for his former misdeeds if they think that they don\u2019t play favorites"]}
