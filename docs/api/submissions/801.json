{"id": 801, "submission_id": "yj9wlq", "title": "AITA Monthly Open Forum November 2022: Civility", "selftext": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n###This month\u2019s deep dive will be on how we enforce rule 1, our civility rule. And about how we fucked with the sub again by updating the language of rule 1. \n\nCivility can be a bit hard to define. Especially in a sub about assholes. Maintaining civility is one of the most important pieces that allows this sub to function, and as such is where we spend much of our moderation efforts. Users spending more effort one-upping each other for the best burn actively works against the productive conversations that those posting find valuable. This month\u2019s deep dive is going to be pretty long; so strap in and [hold onto your butts](https://media3.giphy.com/media/OCu7zWojqFA1W/giphy.gif):\n\nCivility is a big concept, and one that many people define in different ways. It\u2019s also contextual; what you define as civil in your workplace is going to be different from what\u2019s civil in your group chat, which is also different from what\u2019s civil in a pottery class. As such civility is more a [term of art](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/term%20of%20art) for this subreddit, and one that we work to define specifically for this space. In doing so our goal is to ensure this is a community that people are willing to engage with. Posters are opening themselves up and making themselves incredibly vulnerable - sometimes even posting about people they care about. It\u2019s important that they feel free to get the judgment they need without feeling personally attacked - otherwise many wouldn\u2019t be interested in sharing. In order to ensure we\u2019re providing the most valuable feedback we also want to make sure users are willing to judge and engage without feeling personally attacked for sharing - which again is something civility is important for.\n\n\nGiven the context of the subreddit, where we\u2019re not just having abstract discussions of morality but instead having those in the context where real people have been wronged this can be a tricky line to draw. It\u2019s understandable it might not line up with what everyone expects when they see the word civility - because again the definition of that word is contextual. We don\u2019t look at whether the words used are \u201cnice\u201d words, or if we agree with them. Our role as moderators is not to ensure every opinion expressed reflects our values, but to instead maintain a space for users to engage in civil discourse. So, the first line of rule 1 acts as our definition of civility: \u201cAttack ideas, not people.\u201d \n\nWe ask if the comment is attacking the person or the behavior. Recognizing variances to how severe different insults are taken by different people we\u2019ve drawn the line on insults at \u201cno insults at all\u201d. \u201cAsshole\u201d and \u201csucks\u201d are the only exception to this as those are our flairs, one\u2019s the name of the sub, and mostly because we use them to mean \u201cperson in the wrong.\u201d   \n\nAttacking the person isn\u2019t just about insults. It covers other behavior listed in rule 1 of Reddit\u2019s content policy, like [harassment](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043071072) and [promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951). Mocking people or groups, especially based on vulnerability, is not ok. Harassing a user, or following them around the site, is not ok. Just like the content policy points out, being annoying or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. That\u2019s just being an average redditor. Cursing or swearing doesn\u2019t break rule 1. Getting into spats, on the other hand, does. \n\nWe\u2019ve added a small line to rule 1 to better explain this - and cover a few edge cases that weren\u2019t previously covered:\n\n>Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. **Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule**.\n>\n>This rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\n>\n>Be respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n\nWe\u2019ve included some additions to the rule and FAQ to cover things that have popped up in the sub and Modmail over time.\n\n- Regardless of where you\u2019re from, some terms are an insult. While we recognize \u201ccunt\u201d is common in the UK or Australia, it is typically an insult elsewhere. As the FAQ states: \u201cYou may call your friend a \"cunt\", and I might call my dog \"fuckface\", but when you call a stranger that on the internet, you know you're insulting them.\u201d\n\n- \u201cDerogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\u201d This includes stripping someone down to a body part (i.e. \u201cyou\u2019re just a hole for him to stick it in\u201d or calling someone a \u201cbreeder\u201d).\n\n- Despite what you may see on Tik Tok, Facebook, etc. the rules of this sub always apply here. Those sites often grab content before we\u2019ve had a chance to review it. Those platforms may allow insults, but we do not. \n\nRule 1 applies to the comments and not posts. The OP is here asking for judgment. They need to accurately describe how they might have been the asshole in a situation, requiring them to remain civil in their post would be counterproductive. If they called a 10 year old a bitch, they have to be able to tell us they called a 10 year old a bitch. But just because OP called someone a name, or was called a name, doesn\u2019t mean commenters should use the same name. Judge assholes, don\u2019t emulate them. \n\nWe want to be clear. On this sub, civility is about how you talk to and about people. It\u2019s ok to identify shitty behavior. In fact that\u2019s kinda what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019ve all been the asshole at some point - it doesn\u2019t make us bad people. Expect that OP, and their counterpart, are going to read your comment. \n\nTo conclude, we simply want you to play nice. We're not here to roast anyone. Recognize when you're too passionate about a topic to participate. Know when to walk away. Understand some topics will never have consensus and learn to agree to disagree. ***Comment with the goal to give OP actionable feedback on how to improve when they're on the wrong side of a conflict, and to deal with difficult people/situations when they're on the right side.*** \n\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

Another student asked for a pen as well, and the teacher said (paraphrased) \"someone will give you a pen, good looks have incentive.\"   \n\n\nOP was hurt and embarrassed that the teacher was publicly trying to help him get a pen in class, and then told another student they were attractive enough for someone else to give him a pen and not to worry.   \n\n\nEveryone told OP he was being sensitive, insecure, reading into it, the teacher clearly didn't mean anything by it, and said YTA (the question was WIBTA for getting the teacher fired, which granted would likely not happen). People also jumped to pretty explicit insults, telling OP they're probably ugly and need to get used to it, despite OP saying he was self conscious about their looks (I reported those).   \n\n\nIs it just me, or is it both   \n\n\n1. Totally inappropriate for a teacher to call a student attractive/good looking\n2. Absolutely a rude implication to OP in the entire context?

My disclaimer is this: I agree art room jokes are annoying, and I agree assuming two people, of any combination of genders can't have a close, platonic friendship is annoying.\n\nI do not remotely find it homophobic however. I am not a gay man specifically, but I am very very queer. There is no shortage of posts where people\n\n1. Assume OP or others in the story are straight, despite almost no one explicitly stating they are straight in their posts\n2. Act as though a man and woman cannot have a close friendship, and assume they must want to fuck/date each other.\n\nThe fact that assuming people are straight is the norm on this sub, and suggesting men and women happens often enough but is also pushed back on heavily, is all based in heteronormative assumptions. Those are the assumptions I find more homophobic.\n\nSuggesting someone might be in love with their friend of the same gender is not more insulting than suggesting someone might be in love with their friend of another gender. In fact, the majority of the reason people think it's \"offensive\" to consider someone might not be straight very heavily relies on the notion that not being straight is bad, or that it's rude to not assume someone is straight.\n\nI honestly am more bothered by, and find it more LGBTQIA-phobic when people assume everyone is straight unless stated otherwise, and then act like wondering, suggesting, or assuming someone isn't straight is an insult.\n\nI'm not saying people can't disagree with me on this, and again I agree art room jokes are bad AND *I agree with the core annoyance of assuming 2 people can't be close, platonic friends*. But after this overwhelmingly only ever happening to men and women friendships, no, I don't find it homophobic or even as problematic overall. And I don't think it is insulting, offensive, or homophobic to simply *not* assume someone is straight, because not being straight isn't an insult.\n\nHeck, the *main* problematic thing about suggesting men and women can't be close platonic friends is that it's rooted in heteronormative and harmful assumptions about gender and sexuality.

You're still allowed to give actual, helpful and practical advice that touches on the same thought process. b) It *is* kind of... something. I don't know if homophobic is even the right term, but *something* to normalize the idea that close platonic relationships automatically cross the line into something sexual. And you're right, it's not just same sex couples. It's across the board small minded to diminish friendships because lust exists.

Not as a way of challenging OP's stated sexuality, but as a way of simply not assuming OP or someone else in the story is straight.)  \n\n\nMaybe it's a semantics thing, but I've mostly felt disagreement towards some people's phrasing (and maybe they don't mean it this way) that it's homophobic to suggest two people of the same gender specifically cannot be close platonic friends, as opposed to the alternatives we've seen of doing it to friends of all genders, or doing it to men and women friends. And I guess I find it discouraging that people are so much more outraged over it happening to two friends of the same gender than friends of mixed genders.  \n\n\nI agree it's problematic that we've normalized close platonic friendships automatically cross into something sexual, and I do think it's rooted in a swirl of sexism, gender roles, heteronormative assumptions (even when discussing friends of the same gender, because it's usually people trying to extend the heternormative framework to include queer people to, which is not the same as dismantling the framework all together), queer-phobia, narrow views on the roles different relationships in our lives play (the myth that the person you're closest to MUST be your romantic partner at any given moment, or that closeness is a zero sum game) etc...   \n\n\nI just don't find it any more problematic to do it to two men than any other combination of genders, and overall find it less problematic doing it to everyone than just mixed gender friends - Which I guess is part of a wider discussion, and not the rule against art-room jokes specifically.   \n\n\nThanks again!", "Nope, and you wouldn't be.

I didn't mean it as \"yay, more prejudice is good!\" Rather, \"part of the main issue is that people engage in this behavior differently for mixed gender friends than same gender friends. That aspect of the problem is rooted in homophobia. The aspect of the problem that is assuming 2 friends of any genders can't be close is completely different.\" I liken it more to a non-dominant group facing the brunt of an issue, and then that issue extending to a dominant group and the dominant group suddenly going \"This is so unjust!\" Then the non-dominant group says \"yeah, it has been for awhile. You see what we mean?\" and the dominant group says \"Well we shouldn't want this for anyone!\" Which is *true*, but it's the disparity in treatment that exacerbated how problematic it was to begin with.\n\nI was trying to convey that I don't think it's more homophobic to do it to people of any gender combo than it is to only be doing it to mixed gender friends.  \n\n\nI do think in a way extending it to same-gender friends is still problematic, because even then it's extending this heteronormative framework that should be dismantled all together onto queer people as a vail of \"equality\", but I feel like that's different from the idea than what people have been stating.\n\nAs stated though, I agree that the art room comments are uncivil/a bad trope.", "It was pertinent information though as he wasn't contributing to her home, and thought it was perfectly acceptable to use her daughter's wheelchair to move garden rubbish.

That being said if you had just stopped at narcissist and sociopath I might not have bothered responding but to lump the term \"gaslighting\" in with armchair diagnosis I had to say something.\n\nGaslighting is a description of a behavior and I think it is important to realize that there are many posts on here that are only on here because the op has experienced gaslighting or else they would know they are NTA.", "Sure! I'll try to explain it in a way that explains the conversation/what's been going on, not only my take.\n\nA while ago there was an AITA post where, in brief brief summary, a man in either a marriage/essentially marriage/long term relationship turned an extra room in his and his wife/partner's house to an art room for his (man) friend. Many of the comments were either genuinely speculating or joking about OP (man) and his friend being secretly or unknowingly in love.\n\nSince then, making various \"art room\" comments in posts where two men have a close friendship, or where a man is prioritizing his other man friend over  is relationship in a given conflict has become a bit of a meme - statements like \"If OP loves his friend so much he should just build him an art room\".\n\nIn addition to \"art room\" comments being trite and not adding anything - Much like other offhanded references to past posts - marinara flag, the Iranian yogurt is not the issue - or even other over used phrases - Play stupid games win stupid prizes, etc... They've also raised quite a stir due to the additionally harmful narrative that two men cannot be close friends without secretly being in love or wanting to have sex.\n\nWe all pretty much agree on the main issues - the art room jokes are uncivil, disingenuous (they're not used as genuine speculation or questioning if maybe there's more to a friendship than indicated), do not add anything, and at a minimum are just plain annoying. We also agree that it's a harmful trend to constantly imply that two people cannot have a close friendship without it meaning they're secretly attracted to each other.\n\nThat's my best summary of the discussion and events leading to it. My personal comment was noting that I felt like while all the things listed above are problems, people have been targeting mixed gender platonic friendships as a man and woman secretly being attracted to each other, so adding people of the same gender to the mix didn't seem *more* homophobic to me, personally/initially, because my perspective was only ever targeting mixed gender friendships comes from a heteronormative and often queer-phobic place. I didn't (/largely don't, but it's complicated) feel like making those comments about all friendships is more problematic than only doing it to mixed gender friendships. Part of this take came from how people have worded their views in the larger discussion, not about the decision to ban 'art room' jokes specifically.\n\nOther people have offered insights I hadn't considered that has shifted my thinking a bit. Notably, that some of the reason many people feel these comments are more  homophobic-queerphobic has to do with conscious intent vs. lazy assumptions. (I have mixed feelings on this - I largely agree that the intent matters, but I also feel like the subconscious prejudices matter as well), and the fact that the 'art room' comments specifically are not genuine conversation or speculation about the friendships and relationships involved, but usually just an attack or karma-grab. I agree with that part as well, so my complaint was less about the rule and more about parts of the conversation where people say it's rude to assume people are not straight when it isn't stated (when people are assumed to be straight all the time and it's not seen as an insult) or that this is somehow only undermining same-gender friendships, as opposed to treating platonic and non-platonic relationships between any combo of genders as possible.\n\nI hope that captures the history and gist of the conversation while adequately labeling which parts were just my opinion!", "It's too bad that the 80\u00b0 thermostat thread was closed, because it occurred to me in the middle of the night that despite all the criticism of the wife, she was probably right. Yes, normally a house will heat up at the same rate if the thermostat is at 75\u00b0 or 95\u00b0 because when a furnace is on, it's on. However, if the thermostat is installed too close to the air vent, the hot air will quickly turn off the thermostat and the house will stay cold. The furnace will cycle on and off and not provide much warmth. Setting the temperature to 80\u00b0 will keep the furnace on longer and warm up the house, as the wife claimed. One fix is to adjust the thermostat's differential so it stays on longer. A better fix is to move the thermostat away from the heat source.

[This guide from one love on helping a friend](https://www.joinonelove.org/learn/help_a_friend/), along with other guides I've read on the topic, specifically identify telling someone they're in an abusive relationship as not being recommended because it's potentially harmful.  Here's the relevant section:\n\n>Sometimes, our instinct is to immediately label the relationship as \u201cabusive\u201d to drive home the severity of the situation. This instinct, however, can cause your friend to retreat and shut down. Instead, focus on the specific behaviors you\u2019re seeing and how that behavior makes them feel.\n\nNeither of these things violate this subreddits rules today. And if we wanted to expand this subreddit's definition of civility to remove comments that are potentially harmful to someone in an abusive relationship we would necessarily draw the line to remove all of the different kinds of comments that fit this definition. Following the guidelines the professional organizations lay out would also involve removing comments calling someone an abuser.", "I agree with this except for when children are involved. It IS selfish, and arguably abusive in itself, to expose children to a toxic partner. Plus, when you read between the lines in a lot of these posts, it's clear that the OP is allowing the child(ren) to bear the brunt of the abuse so they can have the comfort of staying in the relationsip. One egregious example I remember is when a woman gave away her teenage son's cat to please her abusive fiance.\n\nI get that it can be difficult to leave, but these challenges are what you sign up for when you become a parent.

Then it becomes very easy.", "I have multiple mental illnesses, I'm not trying to be dismissive - but I don't think \"mentality\" is remotely synonymous with mental health/illness/wellbeing. Nor is attacking someone's mentality a comment on their mental health in the slightest - you can essentially rephrase it to say it's attacking a perspective. Perspectives might be influenced by mental health issues, but deeming a perspective on a given topic as harmful is not the same as attacking someone's mental health. I think this concern about mental health attacks might be based on a misconception or misunderstanding of what the word mentality means.\n\nA mentality, which is localized to a subject, is essentially a perspective or a way of thinking. It can be influenced by a mental illness, sure, but critiquing a mentality on a subject isn't critiquing the person, but the perspective. Often the person with a harmful mentality isn't at *fault* for it, but can be harmed by it themself.\n\nA mentality on a given subject is an attitude or way of thinking. Calling a mentality toxic is criticizing that attitude/those ideas, which is allowed on the sub. If I say \"Love for your romantic partner should come before everything else, and anyone should be willing to give up everyone and everything else for the person they love\", someone saying that mentality is toxic is not uncivil, a personal attack, or an attack on mental health (and not particularly wrong). Now, there could be a huge list of factors that contributed to that mentality on love and priorities, including but not limited to trauma or mental illnesses, but the mentality itself is still harmful. It doesn't mean they're a bad person, it doesn't mean they're at fault, it doesn't mean their mental health is being attacked, it means they're being told that attitude/thought process is harmful - heck, even to themself.\n\nThe only firm connection between the word 'mentality' and 'mental health' is that they both have the base word 'mental' in there. But I think the issue is misunderstanding \"mentality\" to mean \"mental health\", when it more closely means \"thought process/reasoning/attitude about this given subject\"", "Genuine question.

It just ain't a magic pill that fixes all problems instantly.\" And then they turn it into \"well obviously you aren't therapy-ing hard enough,\" and that's just not on, in my opinion.", "I\u2019ll leave the detailed explanation to techies\u2019 link but I will say that it\u2019s a bit disconcerting to me that you\u2019re lumping \u201cdead babies\u201d (and death generally) in with \u201cviolent conflicts\u201d. \n\nthe loss of a child _in a violent manner_ absolutely falls under rule 5 and should be reported as such. beyond that, there is nothing inherently violent about death. on top of that, a lot of conflicts spring up around/during/after someone\u2019s death. just because you\u2019re convinced they\u2019re all either fake or above Reddit\u2019s pay-grade doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re correct.\n\nif people want to post to AITA and receive judgment on their conduct in conflicts involving death, they are welcome to do so, even if you think they\u2019re lying or this is the wrong place for it. a lot of users (myself included) have dealt with the loss of babies and children (it happens more often than you\u2019d think) and want to provide feedback to other users on the basis of those experiences. this is the place for us to do that. and even if some of those posts are fake, the exchanges in the comments aren\u2019t.\n\nyou are welcome to scroll past topics that do not interest you. perhaps if more people scrolled past topics that did not interest them, fewer people would make up stories about those topics.", "I've pretty much given up replying on here for that reason - adding to the self satisfied agreement doesn't achieve much unless you're karma hungry, but if you have a different perspective you're just going to get a load of attacks from teenagers who've just discovered what psychology is and woe betide anyone who challenges that expertise.", "Yet it's up to the OP to include information in the original post that is relevant to the situation. \n\nIf a post describes a litany of behaviour that most people would seek counseling for, but OP doesn't mention \"I'm in therapy but progress is slow\" or whatever, then it's not wild for a commenter to assume the opposite.", "You've already got 2 great mod views, so I'lll offer a Regular User View\u2122:\n\nI've discussed this point multiple times in the past, and I think there's 2 things people forget when they say stuff is above our paygrade. The first is that this is a judgement sub, and the second is that this is only a judgement sub.\n\nOn the first point, I can understand support and advice subs punting on topics they understand they cannot provide appropriate support for. Their mission is to provide support and advice, so it follows there will be times they have to refer someone to proper counseling services that they cannot adequately provide. This subreddit isn't about that. It's a judgement sub to determine who was morally in the wrong in conflicts that regular people face. A child's death is unfortunately not an uncommon event, and it can be the catalyst for conflicts. People in such situations don't have the luxury of telling the other person in the conflict to please wait for a response while they consult professionals for advice and support on the matter. They have to navigate a path in the moment as a regular person, and there's no reason we regular people cannot judge if that path was a morally correct one.\n\nOn the second point, this is only a subreddit. We're not the Grand High Inquisitors of All Moral Philosophy, fancy ass-pun-based flair titles aside. We're just people offering opinions on the morality of a person's actions so they can try to understand if they were in the right or not. If we say someone was morally wrong to kick Great Aunt Gertrude out of their child's funeral, we have not made any major advancements in moral philosophy that will have wide-reaching effects the world over. We've just helped a grieving person understand that they didn't fuck up an interpersonal interaction. If we tell them that Great Aunt Gertrude was just trying to offer help and support in a clumsy way and shouldn't have been kicked out, we're still not changing the world. We're just telling a grieving person their grief got the better of them in this case.", "This place would be more civil if you took the genders out of posts. Every post currently turns into a boys vs. girls shitfest no matter how obviously one-sided the fact pattern is.", "Am I the only one driven crazy by the number of times one partner in a relationship is kicked out/told to leave by the other partner?\n\nMy spouse and I share a home and a bedroom. If one of us is angry enough that we don't want to be around the other person, then it's on the angry individual to leave. I don't have any authority to make her leave her home/bedroom, and she doesn't have that authority over me.\n\nThe only exception I can see to this is when one person is egregiously and indisputably wrong (cheating, committing felonies, etc.). \n\nDisagreements about how to best parent, the tone one took with in-laws, forgetting a birthday/anniversary, etc. don't justify one owner/lessee telling another owner/lessee they're not welcome in their own home.", "I disagree. I think that the underlying message is \"you're broken. Get fixed.\" Which is inherently uncivil. OP shouldn't need to specify that they're in therapy, or that it's slow going. Quite frankly, it's a process that is always slow, and never the magic pill people pretend it is. Anyone who's familiar with it knows that.\n\nAsking is always better than assuming, anyway. You know that cheesy u and me line."]}
