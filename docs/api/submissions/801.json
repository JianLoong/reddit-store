{"id": 801, "submission_id": "yj9wlq", "title": "AITA Monthly Open Forum November 2022: Civility", "selftext": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n###This month\u2019s deep dive will be on how we enforce rule 1, our civility rule. And about how we fucked with the sub again by updating the language of rule 1. \n\nCivility can be a bit hard to define. Especially in a sub about assholes. Maintaining civility is one of the most important pieces that allows this sub to function, and as such is where we spend much of our moderation efforts. Users spending more effort one-upping each other for the best burn actively works against the productive conversations that those posting find valuable. This month\u2019s deep dive is going to be pretty long; so strap in and [hold onto your butts](https://media3.giphy.com/media/OCu7zWojqFA1W/giphy.gif):\n\nCivility is a big concept, and one that many people define in different ways. It\u2019s also contextual; what you define as civil in your workplace is going to be different from what\u2019s civil in your group chat, which is also different from what\u2019s civil in a pottery class. As such civility is more a [term of art](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/term%20of%20art) for this subreddit, and one that we work to define specifically for this space. In doing so our goal is to ensure this is a community that people are willing to engage with. Posters are opening themselves up and making themselves incredibly vulnerable - sometimes even posting about people they care about. It\u2019s important that they feel free to get the judgment they need without feeling personally attacked - otherwise many wouldn\u2019t be interested in sharing. In order to ensure we\u2019re providing the most valuable feedback we also want to make sure users are willing to judge and engage without feeling personally attacked for sharing - which again is something civility is important for.\n\n\nGiven the context of the subreddit, where we\u2019re not just having abstract discussions of morality but instead having those in the context where real people have been wronged this can be a tricky line to draw. It\u2019s understandable it might not line up with what everyone expects when they see the word civility - because again the definition of that word is contextual. We don\u2019t look at whether the words used are \u201cnice\u201d words, or if we agree with them. Our role as moderators is not to ensure every opinion expressed reflects our values, but to instead maintain a space for users to engage in civil discourse. So, the first line of rule 1 acts as our definition of civility: \u201cAttack ideas, not people.\u201d \n\nWe ask if the comment is attacking the person or the behavior. Recognizing variances to how severe different insults are taken by different people we\u2019ve drawn the line on insults at \u201cno insults at all\u201d. \u201cAsshole\u201d and \u201csucks\u201d are the only exception to this as those are our flairs, one\u2019s the name of the sub, and mostly because we use them to mean \u201cperson in the wrong.\u201d   \n\nAttacking the person isn\u2019t just about insults. It covers other behavior listed in rule 1 of Reddit\u2019s content policy, like [harassment](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043071072) and [promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951). Mocking people or groups, especially based on vulnerability, is not ok. Harassing a user, or following them around the site, is not ok. Just like the content policy points out, being annoying or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. That\u2019s just being an average redditor. Cursing or swearing doesn\u2019t break rule 1. Getting into spats, on the other hand, does. \n\nWe\u2019ve added a small line to rule 1 to better explain this - and cover a few edge cases that weren\u2019t previously covered:\n\n>Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. **Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule**.\n>\n>This rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\n>\n>Be respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n\nWe\u2019ve included some additions to the rule and FAQ to cover things that have popped up in the sub and Modmail over time.\n\n- Regardless of where you\u2019re from, some terms are an insult. While we recognize \u201ccunt\u201d is common in the UK or Australia, it is typically an insult elsewhere. As the FAQ states: \u201cYou may call your friend a \"cunt\", and I might call my dog \"fuckface\", but when you call a stranger that on the internet, you know you're insulting them.\u201d\n\n- \u201cDerogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\u201d This includes stripping someone down to a body part (i.e. \u201cyou\u2019re just a hole for him to stick it in\u201d or calling someone a \u201cbreeder\u201d).\n\n- Despite what you may see on Tik Tok, Facebook, etc. the rules of this sub always apply here. Those sites often grab content before we\u2019ve had a chance to review it. Those platforms may allow insults, but we do not. \n\nRule 1 applies to the comments and not posts. The OP is here asking for judgment. They need to accurately describe how they might have been the asshole in a situation, requiring them to remain civil in their post would be counterproductive. If they called a 10 year old a bitch, they have to be able to tell us they called a 10 year old a bitch. But just because OP called someone a name, or was called a name, doesn\u2019t mean commenters should use the same name. Judge assholes, don\u2019t emulate them. \n\nWe want to be clear. On this sub, civility is about how you talk to and about people. It\u2019s ok to identify shitty behavior. In fact that\u2019s kinda what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019ve all been the asshole at some point - it doesn\u2019t make us bad people. Expect that OP, and their counterpart, are going to read your comment. \n\nTo conclude, we simply want you to play nice. We're not here to roast anyone. Recognize when you're too passionate about a topic to participate. Know when to walk away. Understand some topics will never have consensus and learn to agree to disagree. ***Comment with the goal to give OP actionable feedback on how to improve when they're on the wrong side of a conflict, and to deal with difficult people/situations when they're on the right side.*** \n\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

I read the first comment to suggest you thought that scenario was unrealistic, and the follow up \"Bullshit\" to OP's answer about it being a small town to indicate disbelief.  \n\n\nBut I frequently misinterpret people, so my apologies if that's not what you meant. Again, I don't think you should be downvoted and you're totally entitled to your judgement on the situation, or to wonder if something is real or not.
