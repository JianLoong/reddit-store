{"id": 801, "submission_id": "yj9wlq", "title": "AITA Monthly Open Forum November 2022: Civility", "selftext": "#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.\n\n###This month\u2019s deep dive will be on how we enforce rule 1, our civility rule. And about how we fucked with the sub again by updating the language of rule 1. \n\nCivility can be a bit hard to define. Especially in a sub about assholes. Maintaining civility is one of the most important pieces that allows this sub to function, and as such is where we spend much of our moderation efforts. Users spending more effort one-upping each other for the best burn actively works against the productive conversations that those posting find valuable. This month\u2019s deep dive is going to be pretty long; so strap in and [hold onto your butts](https://media3.giphy.com/media/OCu7zWojqFA1W/giphy.gif):\n\nCivility is a big concept, and one that many people define in different ways. It\u2019s also contextual; what you define as civil in your workplace is going to be different from what\u2019s civil in your group chat, which is also different from what\u2019s civil in a pottery class. As such civility is more a [term of art](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/term%20of%20art) for this subreddit, and one that we work to define specifically for this space. In doing so our goal is to ensure this is a community that people are willing to engage with. Posters are opening themselves up and making themselves incredibly vulnerable - sometimes even posting about people they care about. It\u2019s important that they feel free to get the judgment they need without feeling personally attacked - otherwise many wouldn\u2019t be interested in sharing. In order to ensure we\u2019re providing the most valuable feedback we also want to make sure users are willing to judge and engage without feeling personally attacked for sharing - which again is something civility is important for.\n\n\nGiven the context of the subreddit, where we\u2019re not just having abstract discussions of morality but instead having those in the context where real people have been wronged this can be a tricky line to draw. It\u2019s understandable it might not line up with what everyone expects when they see the word civility - because again the definition of that word is contextual. We don\u2019t look at whether the words used are \u201cnice\u201d words, or if we agree with them. Our role as moderators is not to ensure every opinion expressed reflects our values, but to instead maintain a space for users to engage in civil discourse. So, the first line of rule 1 acts as our definition of civility: \u201cAttack ideas, not people.\u201d \n\nWe ask if the comment is attacking the person or the behavior. Recognizing variances to how severe different insults are taken by different people we\u2019ve drawn the line on insults at \u201cno insults at all\u201d. \u201cAsshole\u201d and \u201csucks\u201d are the only exception to this as those are our flairs, one\u2019s the name of the sub, and mostly because we use them to mean \u201cperson in the wrong.\u201d   \n\nAttacking the person isn\u2019t just about insults. It covers other behavior listed in rule 1 of Reddit\u2019s content policy, like [harassment](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043071072) and [promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951). Mocking people or groups, especially based on vulnerability, is not ok. Harassing a user, or following them around the site, is not ok. Just like the content policy points out, being annoying or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. That\u2019s just being an average redditor. Cursing or swearing doesn\u2019t break rule 1. Getting into spats, on the other hand, does. \n\nWe\u2019ve added a small line to rule 1 to better explain this - and cover a few edge cases that weren\u2019t previously covered:\n\n>Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. **Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule**.\n>\n>This rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\n>\n>Be respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n\nWe\u2019ve included some additions to the rule and FAQ to cover things that have popped up in the sub and Modmail over time.\n\n- Regardless of where you\u2019re from, some terms are an insult. While we recognize \u201ccunt\u201d is common in the UK or Australia, it is typically an insult elsewhere. As the FAQ states: \u201cYou may call your friend a \"cunt\", and I might call my dog \"fuckface\", but when you call a stranger that on the internet, you know you're insulting them.\u201d\n\n- \u201cDerogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\u201d This includes stripping someone down to a body part (i.e. \u201cyou\u2019re just a hole for him to stick it in\u201d or calling someone a \u201cbreeder\u201d).\n\n- Despite what you may see on Tik Tok, Facebook, etc. the rules of this sub always apply here. Those sites often grab content before we\u2019ve had a chance to review it. Those platforms may allow insults, but we do not. \n\nRule 1 applies to the comments and not posts. The OP is here asking for judgment. They need to accurately describe how they might have been the asshole in a situation, requiring them to remain civil in their post would be counterproductive. If they called a 10 year old a bitch, they have to be able to tell us they called a 10 year old a bitch. But just because OP called someone a name, or was called a name, doesn\u2019t mean commenters should use the same name. Judge assholes, don\u2019t emulate them. \n\nWe want to be clear. On this sub, civility is about how you talk to and about people. It\u2019s ok to identify shitty behavior. In fact that\u2019s kinda what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019ve all been the asshole at some point - it doesn\u2019t make us bad people. Expect that OP, and their counterpart, are going to read your comment. \n\nTo conclude, we simply want you to play nice. We're not here to roast anyone. Recognize when you're too passionate about a topic to participate. Know when to walk away. Understand some topics will never have consensus and learn to agree to disagree. ***Comment with the goal to give OP actionable feedback on how to improve when they're on the wrong side of a conflict, and to deal with difficult people/situations when they're on the right side.*** \n\n\n#As always, do not directly link to posts/comments or post uncensored screenshots here.

Can we report  post where the person is just existing as no interpersonal conflict?

Lately (like the past several months) I\u2019ve noticed someone will post a relatively straightforward conflict and when I look at the comments it\u2019s literally paragraph after paragraph of people either sharing their own stories or responding to the people sharing their stories arguing. Multiple times I\u2019ve had to scroll 20+ comments down to see an actual judgement. \ud83d\ude05 Not to mention folks who really stretch the story to fit whatever narrative they have in their mind. I know we can infer things from a post but some judgements are literally based on nothing. If OP doesn\u2019t say they\u2019re gay/neurodivergent/etc then let\u2019s take them at their word. Don\u2019t make a judgement based on your own ideas. Not sure if that makes sense lol.", "I know this isn't realistic, but would anyone else love an age limit? Am I the only one who sees (14F) and immediately backs out??", "Lack of civility to other commenters (not the OP) is what I think prevents more users from offering alternative judgments (or even just alternative points of view that still match the thread's consensus judgment). And when that happens, the OP suffers from not seeing other perspectives to the conflict.\n\nI wish more people would stick to giving top-level judgment to the OP and/or responding to the OP's comments, vs. arguing with and demeaning others who have given their judgment. \n\nAnd of course, you Mods are relying on others to use the Report button for incivility. I think many users would throttle back if they got a slap on the hand for using (what they considered acceptable) insults.", "i don't know how the content filters that flag posts for things like suicide, rape, etc exactly work, but can i make some suggestions on what to add? \n\nsewerslide, sewer slide, S/A, sa'd, unalive, unalived, unaliving\n\ni've just seen an increase in people trying to evade the filters using those.", "I think it's annoying to keep seeing posters who refuse to participate in their post when they've clearly left information out. Tons of \"missing reasons\" like, \"I said something unfortunate and now they won't talk to me\" or \"this person ripped me off but the court ruled in their favor anyway\" or \"my wife wasn't comfortable with a picture of a married couple kissing\". Maybe even the variation of \"I'm only going to respond to the one person who agrees with me\". \n\nIf this isn't supposed to be a popcorn sub where we're all here for the drama, OPs should be required to participate to some extent. It's weird that people have time to make a long, rambling post, but don't have time to answer a few obvious questions that get asked a million times. If folks expect thoughtful, civil answers to their problems, give enough info for people to work with.", "[deleted]", "Yes, absolutely. In [our faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_rule_7.3A_post_interpersonal_conflicts) we list these point for what is necessary for an interpersonal conflict:\n\n* OP took action against a person. \n\n* That person is upset with OP for that action or thinks that action was morally wrong.\n\n* They convey that to OP, causing OP to question if they were the asshole for taking that action\n\nIf OP didn't take an action and \"doesn't actually do anything to incite conflict\" (may have to steal that line for a future faq update) you can report for rule 7, and in some cases rule 12.", "I see you also read the braces post...", "That is already against the rules (most likely rules 7 or 8).", "Along with the pedantic metering of what each person is or is not legally entitled to.

If people don't upvote these posts then they won't gain traction. I do get concerned when young people post and I see commenters calling on them to go nc with family etc, but to ban them just because their post isnt interesting to me just seems exclusive.", "That\u2019s why we give warnings. Our experience is most people, once they\u2019ve been alerted to how strict the rule is, adjust accordingly. \n\nThe discussions in the comments are great imo though. That\u2019s were minds often get changed and you really learn what details matter to people. So I wouldn\u2019t want to dissuade people from replying to each other. Just remind them to keep everything above the belt, so to speak.", "All of those are already in there except for sa'd, which I just added!\n\nKeeping up with the newest tiktok language in a challenge.\n\nedit: wait, I forget the syntax to add stuff with an apostrophe without breaking things, so that will be added once someone else with the answer does it.", "There are a lot more tells that that story is a work of fiction than the size of the participants.", "I think a major reason people were calling that Fat Post fake was that OP just happened to be a model who got to \"walk in fashion week\"* and the teacher thought it was a good idea to call on her to, off the cuff, respond to the other girl's speech. \n\n(*Here's what women who \"walk in fashion week\" look like. Some are 18, but these Top Hits at least are mostly international.  https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/top-models-of-spring-summer-2022)", "> Second, their stories are either so tragic that they can\u2019t be judged or so petty that they are boring.\n\nOh my gosh yes. Either abusive parents (absolutely awful). Or like, who can sit at my lunch table.", "Seriously. I also think it's really just not a good place for minors to come for advice and judgment anyway - especially when posts take off, it seems to me that many people dog piling on with the extreme Reddit views (you don't owe anyone *anything*,  if you've been wronged go nc with your whole family etc etc) is just really not helpful or healthy for minors to deal with.", ">Yeah, first off I\u2019m just not going to call a minor an asshole.\n\nIf it helps, it's not meant to say they're *an* asshole in general, but if, given the situation, they're *the* asshole - the one in the wrong, the aggressor, overreacting to a slight, etc. The debate in every thread is not meant to be a judgment of anyone's character as a whole, but to say \"Given the circumstances, did you choose badly or go too far?\"\n\nI do agree that the comments might eviscerate a teen poster who did something wrong, though ... which is a pity, because it can be valuable to learn \"Hey, you messed up; here's what you could do better.\"", "I do hate reading partway though a post that has no ages and realizing it's Teen Drama.
