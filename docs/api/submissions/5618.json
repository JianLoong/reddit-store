I\u2019m sorry for your loss. It sounds like your brother is angry which is not abnormal when grieving but it\u2019s not ok to take that anger out on you.", "Reddit person here. And I say, NTA. If it was a concern about the cost, HE and the family members who are \"ticked off\" can chip in an fork up the money. Or shut up. haha. If they aren't participating in the cost, they don't get to make extra demands. \n\nAnd, if it's truly something that your mother wouldn't want, then you're doing thing as a show of respect for her because she is important to you. And there's nothing wrong with advocating for her wishes like this. You just want her to be laid to rest the way she wanted and in peace. And there's not a shred of ahole in that.", "NTA - Sorry for your loss. It sounds like your brother is going through the steps of grieving. I was an ER nurse for many years and have seen many, many elderly individuals succumb to falls. Probably more than one person should ever see. For some it can be difficult to accept something which we perceive to be small or insignificant can have tragic results.", "NTA - There doesn't seem to be any reason to think that your mother didn't die from natural causes, so autopsy would definitely be pointless. It could be that your brother just doesn't want to accept that she is gone and somehow thinks doing an autopsy would give some reasoning to her passing. It could be beneficial to you both to just try to talk with him and explain your view and how you just want to respect your mother's wishes. \n\nAlso, why should you be paying for an autopsy you don't want done? 2000 isn't a small amount of money. \n\nSorry for your loss and I truly hope that you and your brother can work through this thing.", "Edit: **NTA** after more info from OP.\n\n**I N F O**, does your brother suspect foul play or what\u2019s the reason for wanting an autopsy? It\u2019s hard to judge properly without knowing that part of the equation.", "NTA full stop no need to even entertain these other comments. Brother can pay or brother can stfu. End.\nSorry for your loss.", "NTA. Your mother wasn't the victim of a crime, so what would be the point? And how can your brother possibly justify making you spend your money on it? He could at the very least have offered to pay for the autopsy himself.", "NTA  \n\"I am respecting mother's wishes.  The discussion is closed.\"", "NTA If he wants the full autopsy done then he should pay for it. If you do not want it and think she wouldn't have wanted it, then why should you pay for it. You are not the AH for not paying for something you do not think is right.", "NAH I'm sorry for your loss your brother is prob sky grieving in his own way seperate from you but that doesn't mean you should have to pay 2k learn what you already know about her passing. Some people don't ever want to let go and it's hard but hopefully in time he'll see that the request wasn't feasible", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If I thought someone I loved had been harmed, especially by someone with a duty to care for her, I would want to be able to legally pursue that. \n\nGiven that you are far away and your brother the person physically closest, it makes sense to ask.\n\nHowever, if it was just a fall, maybe a fall caused by a stroke or heart attack, but you don't know...sometimes we all have to live with not knowing.", "NAH. My father recently passed from what we believe to be a massive and quick heart attack. There were some ppl who immediately said we needed to get an autopsy. I refused, as did some of my sisters. A heart attack wasnt outside of the realm of possibility. Its grief speaking and once he calms down, hopefully he sees this. Im so sorry for the passing of your mother.", "I'm going NTA because of your mother's wishes. I'm a firm believer in honoring what someone would want. Did she not have any life insurance to help with costs? I also understand your brother's concerns though. Just because she was sick doesn't mean it was necessarily her time to go and if it's going off of what the facility says he has every right to question it if it seems suspicious. It comes back all the time that there is abuse in these types of homes.", "NTA.   2K is a lot of money, and unless foul play is involved, what good will it do?\n\nTell brother's wife and \"the family who knows\" that they're all welcome to chip in and come up with the 2K.", "NTA, if he wants the autopsy he should pay for it. You see no reason for an autopsy, why would you spend $2,000 on something only he wants?\n\nEveryone here is grieving, his grief doesn't give him the right to lash out at you. I think you should temporarily take time away from him and keep it that way until he's ready to come to you and sincerely apologize for his actions", "Info\u2014 I wonder if he just wants to be listened to, even if it\u2019s just by a coroner. You\u2019re not there and he\u2019s upset. I think he needs a listening ear. \n\nAnd you haven\u2019t shown that you have given him that listening ear.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. My own mom died in a similar way. The coroner suggested an autopsy (and so it cost us nothing) and we agreed and it meant insurance paid as it was an accidental death. But my mom wanted her brain to be examined and contributed to science so I don\u2019t feel badly her body was violated for money. \n\nDoes he want vindication that she was hurt by hospital staff or something? Is he shocked by her loss and can\u2019t understand it? Would the autopsy results help in anyway? \n\nSo that\u2019s my advice\u2014 talk to him and try to understand what he hopes will be gained from this. Have sympathy that he\u2019s been closer to this and is probably taking it harder because of that. Footing the bill is hard, but the arrangements for your mother\u2019s death is probably worse.", "Why do you think your mom wouldn't want that? After I got a job that required looking at multiple death certificates every day, I was SHOCKED by the number of people who die for pretty unclear reasons and with no autopsy so I tell everyone that I absolutely want an autopsy if I die, even if the cause seems obvious. \nYTA, give your brother his peace. Or. Why wouldn't you?", "I get that, so I'm not mad at him. He'll come around after a while once he's calmed down and we'll have a chat. He deserves to be angry, so that's fine. I know he isn't doing it to be malicious, he's just hurting and it's caused a few problems....he's got a big heart and gets overly emotional thanks to being autistic.", "hear, hear!", "Thank you. Once he's had a little time to process we'll have a Chay and get this fixed. I know he's not doing any of it to he an AH intentionally, he's hurting as well and doesn't always handle emotions well. I'd pay the money, but it's not what she would want....and honestly it seems mostly cut and dry. The care home isn't the best, or wasn't, but mum hid a lot from me because she always hated hurting me. So maybe he knows more than I do, I don't know. Maybe I can pry it out of him once he's calmed down.", "She was in a care home, on hospice care. She refused to wait for a nurse to show up to help her to the restroom because she didn't like giving up her independence. She fell which caused a head injury resulting in her death. It was quick. \n\nIt isn't the best of places as we couldn't afford better, and neither could she. But she also hid a lot from me because she didn't want me to know when things were bad...cause mums protective and doesn't like hurting me.", "Unfortunately they've been on hard times due to other issues, and I managed to save up since I suspected that this would be happening, even if not quite so soon. He's trying, but I wouldn't expect him to pay for it if he'd have to go into debt to do so.", "Unfortunately she did not want to give up her independence and refused to wait for the nurse on call to assist her to the toilet. She was in a care home on hospice care. She fell on the way back which caused a massive head injury that most likely caused an aneurysm.", "It\u2019s a hard time for all of you. And he\u2019s making it harder for you because he\u2019s hurting so much and focusing on the \u201cwhy\u201d. There is no \u201cwhy\u201d. There\u2019s only love and grief when you lose someone. You don\u2019t just lose the person but you lose also part of yourself. That special bond there was between you. I can imagine that\u2019s even harder to process for him because he\u2019s autistic.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that, those circumstances suck. Wanting to cling on to your independence is something very human, definitely understandable.\n\nIt does sound like you already accept and believe that whatever the autopsy would presumably prove was the cause of death, was indeed it. Even so you don\u2019t feel the autopsy is necessary, which makes me think you\u2019re not looking to go after anyone about it anyway, thus making getting the autopsy a moot issue. This, along with you being the one paying for the whole thing, and believing it\u2019s not what she would have wanted, makes this an **NTA**.\n\nGo ahead with whatever you think she would have wanted. If he disagrees, well..that\u2019s unfortunate, but your money your decision.", "Even in the most expensive care home this accident could have occurred.\n\nI took care of my partner at home during hospice and I couldn't always stop them from trying to get out of bed on their own.\n\nI understand that your brother is probably focused on the accident due to grief, but I agree with you that an autopsy is a needless expense.\n\nNTA", "Are you positive of this story or going by what the care facility says?", "Right. But that doesn't mean you should pay for it either", "Also, your brother is a grown man, if he is willing to go into debt over having an autopsy done, that is his choice. That doesn't mean you have to step in to rescue him. He's a grown man let him make his choices", "I saw the images, it's what it paints. Unfortunately it's what we know and that's about it.", "I get it. I'm also a lover of true crime lol so I would question it but after seeing the care from our local facility with my mom before she passed I'd second guess everything that happened while family/friends weren't present. Not saying either of you are right or wrong. I'm very sorry for your loss though."]}
