Its something I grew up doing with my dad, who passed during college.  I gave up my season tickets for her because where we relocated to is at least a 2 hour drive to Stillwater.  I wanted to continue making the drive, she didn't.  I love her and gave up the tickets.

They schedule one non- conference game with the team for a home-and-away series for two years.  They may never schedule one again.  College football is typically all about the conference schedule.  OSU plays all its Big-12 opponents every year and most teams very rarely schedule many non-conference games against other Power 5 conference teams (the PAC-12, Big12, Big10, ACC and SEC are the \"power 5 conferences\")  The non conference is usually scheduled against lower conference teams to pad out some easier wins. \n\nSo with all that being said.  Seeing an OSU vs ASU game in Tempe, Arizona (location of ASU campus) would indeed be a very rare event.  If ASU was to switch conferences to the Big12, then they would play each other every year, with them playing @ OSU and @ ASU every other year.  There are rumors ASU could join the Big-12, but that is just a rumor right now.\n\nThe fact that he has a good college friend in Tempe, I will admit this would be an amazing opportunity as a sports fan and to re-connect with some college friends.  It would be a major bummer to miss.\n\nThat being said, dude, YWBTA, you would still be an enormous AH.  I understand how disappointing it is, I'm a huge college football fan as well.  But you are married now, presumably to someone you actually love.  YOUR FAMILY ALWAYS TAKES PRIORITY.  I get it, it sucks to miss, your wife will also only turn 30 once.  If she was a sports fan, and understood the obsession, and wanted to go with you, that would be different.  She wants you at home with her and to celebrate and that's where you priority must lie.  It's really that simple.   Sadly, at some point you have to grow up and realize that your wife is going to be the one that navigates your life with you, not a rotating group of 20 somethings wearing your favorite uniform.", "If your wife says YWBTA, then you have your answer.

If kids would stop you from being able to do the things you enjoy, don't have kids yet until that changes. Stay for the birthday, plan to go to the next one, and tell her that you are in fact going to the next matchup with your friends. If that means putting off having kids until they play in 202(?), so be it. Don't skip your wife's 30th for a football game that will probably be 35-13, but do make other plans to see the people in your life that are important to you.", "Ignoring your wife's wishes about her own birthday and asking strangers what they think is Peak Man.

It took me minute to work out what you were saying, but it sounds like these teams don\u2019t play together often? And this is /potentially/ a once in a lifetime opportunity because of that. Your buddy has a house in the city of the rival team that you never play against? But if your teams end up in the same conference, this trip would happen a lot more often? \n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s say that the teams will never play together again and your team will also never again play against a team near where another friend has a house. Let\u2019s say you and your college buddies will never again have a weekend of drinking and football. Friendships are important and you probably won\u2019t do weekend trips with them very often once you have kids. But, you\u2019re in a new phase of life. The wife\u2019s milestone birthday trumps all of that. It just does. I understand why it\u2019s hard, but you\u2019re building a new life with her and she has to be the priority.

And it's time limited.\n\nBut your wife can celebrate her birthday literally any day.\n\nI think pitching it as a football game makes it look silly, and YTA. But pitching it as \"my college friends are getting back together for a weekend for the first time in years\" makes your wife TA if she's going to demand her birthday be celebrated on that exact weekend instead of literally any other weekend of the year.\n\nSo, I'm on the fence here.", "I think you need to stay home this year, bud.

You don't mention if you have children, but if your wife feels this way about birthdays you've no wiggle room anywhere.\n\nPlease consider a conversation with your spouse in a neutral space when emotions are not so high.

Just stuck in a situation that requires finesse & emotional maturity.", "NAH, which is likely to be an unpopular opinion. \n\nThe games sound about as important to you as your wife's birthday is to her. Whether internet strangers agree the are equally important is besides the point. Some understanding could be given both ways. Have you stepped up and offered an alternative to make sure she feels celebrated, loved and thought of for her birthday this year? Has she been open to any discussions to support your love for your team by adjusting when her celebration is to take place?\n\nI assume if her birthday fell in the middle of the week, it would be celebrated either the weekend before or after the actual day. It should not be too insane a suggestion to have a full celebration / large party on another day that weekend, the weekend before, or the weekend after. Joining your trip on her actual birthday doesn't mean it has to ruin her birthday or that no other celebration is possible. \n\nFrom the other side, if she is being flexible with the day, you could do more to make both her actual birthday day and whatever day you celebrate special as well. If she were to come for the trip to the game it should not be hard to organize everyone going out to celebrate while you're there (not necessarily game day). It should also be a simple conversation for you to plan and organize celebrations with her friends and family on another date. Take some initiative and come up with a plan, don't just tell her you want to go to the game and expect everything else to get done. \n\nOne last suggestion, if she is open to changing the date of her birthday celebration and she also comes with you on her actual birthday to the game, you should think about a trip for her. Where would she like to go for a weekend? Is there a small getaway for her that you could plan or have her input to so that you also take a weekend away doing something she wants? It doesn't have to be expensive, just something for her.\n\nSorry for the rant but, as usual in this sub, communication is key.", "nta", "NTA.

Do most of them live nearby you?
