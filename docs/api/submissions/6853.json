He constantly puts stuff away because he likes the home clean, forgets where he puts them, and forces me to have to look for things. We\u2019ve talked about this more times than I can count. He always says \u201cok I\u2019ll pay attention next time\u201d but it never lasts.\n\nI am the type that has messy desks but always knows where everything is. When Cooper puts my things away thinking he\u2019s helping it frustrates me to no end because now I can\u2019t find anything.\n\nI\u2019m a bit of a foodie and do all the cooking in the house. I thought this weekend that I\u2019ll make something nice for Cooper. So I made lamb belly stew. There are dozens of ingredients and I laid everything on the kitchen table so I can conveniently reach them.\n\n2 hours into cooking, Cooper walked into the kitchen and started having a conversation. He was hungry and the smell of food was just too much for him to bear. We were talking and out of the corner of my eye I see Cooper begin to take all the ingredients on the table and put them back in the fridge - ingredients I was still using.\n\nAt that moment kitchen rage came over me. Without a word I took the stew and poured everything into the sink, walked upstairs and went to bed hungry, leaving Cooper dumbfounded.\n\nI still haven\u2019t spoken to Cooper because I\u2019m still angry. I told a coworker about this and they say I may have been TA cuz I overreacted to a minor inconvenience. But I felt I was justified because the frustration has been building for years at this point.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: several of you asked why I didn\u2019t use words to communicate. That is because this happened several times and we\u2019ve spoken about it many times. If I leave a saucepan or stick to cool off, I\u2019d come back to find that Cooper has washed the cookeries and thrown out the content because he didn\u2019t know it was food. So I\u2019ve always made it abundantly clear Cooper is not too touch anything when I\u2019m cooking.\n\nAs far as we know he\u2019s always been like this and not because of old age.

It was kind of a jerk move. But I get it. This is something you've talked about many times and your partner doesn't seem to comprehend how annoying it is. It's hard to keep our cool when we're pushed to hard, even if the issue is relatively minor. \n\nAs for your partner, he's getting older and if he's not actually having memory problems, no doubt he's worried about them. And worried about remaining functional period. It's possible some of his need to keep so active is a bit outsized because of this. \n\nAs to still being mad. Is it possible you're maybe less angry than embarrassed? It was a silly thing to lose it over. \n\nMaybe the two of you can see the humor in it. Because I certainly do. \n\nI can see him coming into the kitchen stomach growling and getting sidetracked by the need to tidy up.

Usually that's a good thing.\r  \n\r  \nI get that he's frustrating to live with at times, but you need to keep in mind that at 65, his memory isn't what it used to be.

Keep that in mind and be patient with your elderly partner.", "YTA full on tantrum mode was engaged rather than the brain. Simple communication would have been much better.", "Soft YTA. Along with several other observations you made in your post, tidying things to get them out of sight rather than being organised is a classic sign of ADD. You'll find doom boxes and drawers of stuff where nothing is related to anything else. It's driven by a real need for visible order, rather than a need for any underlying order. Cooper can't himself, and isn't even aware he's doing it. No amount of scolding or complaining or reasoning or bargaining is going to help. It's absolutely infuriating but it is what it is at this point. See if he'll go see a doctor, and help him present all the behaviours.", "Cooper sucks here. At 65 he is unlikely to be suffering from significant cognitive decline, so it is likely that he is being an AH when he photobombs your Zoom calls and over-rides your decisions about where to place stuff without discussion. You have not given enough context to judge whether tossing out your cooking is a over-reaction or a reasonable move to shock him into behaving himself. So, my judgment is INFO.", "YTA. You could have just said that you're still using the ingredients.\n\nAt the same time I'm with Cooper on this one. Taking refrigerated ingredients out and leaving them out for a lengthy period of time to get nice and room temperature again and then put them back in the fridge is a breeding ground for bacteria.\n\nHim also forgetting where he put things while cleaning shouldn't make you loose your mind either. I'm 33 and do that. Why do you feel the need to make his life miserable about it instead of joking about it and just accepting him for his quirks?\n\nIf everything he does bothers you to the point of throwing out food mid preperation, why are you even with him?

While dumping the food was a little extreme in my personal opinion, this is a recurring issue, and he broke the rule that you two have established for your relationship.

He'd move everyone's stuff and randomly organize cupboards he hadn't looked in for a decade. He just grew up in a time and with a family where the man of the house did whatever he felt like in the moment without even considering other people. He came by it honestly but it was also him having a control freak personality and also being rather selfish in that regard. My one aunt kept insisting he live with her instead of a home when he got bad enough that one person living with him wasn't working anymore. I tried to warn her that he would dig through her stuff and \"organize\" it like before except it had gotten ten times worse but she thought I was just being whiny and they never appreciated how difficult he became to live with when his personality and Alzheimers combined to make the world's biggest super bored busy body.
