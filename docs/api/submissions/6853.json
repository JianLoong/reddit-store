He constantly puts stuff away because he likes the home clean, forgets where he puts them, and forces me to have to look for things. We\u2019ve talked about this more times than I can count. He always says \u201cok I\u2019ll pay attention next time\u201d but it never lasts.\n\nI am the type that has messy desks but always knows where everything is. When Cooper puts my things away thinking he\u2019s helping it frustrates me to no end because now I can\u2019t find anything.\n\nI\u2019m a bit of a foodie and do all the cooking in the house. I thought this weekend that I\u2019ll make something nice for Cooper. So I made lamb belly stew. There are dozens of ingredients and I laid everything on the kitchen table so I can conveniently reach them.\n\n2 hours into cooking, Cooper walked into the kitchen and started having a conversation. He was hungry and the smell of food was just too much for him to bear. We were talking and out of the corner of my eye I see Cooper begin to take all the ingredients on the table and put them back in the fridge - ingredients I was still using.\n\nAt that moment kitchen rage came over me. Without a word I took the stew and poured everything into the sink, walked upstairs and went to bed hungry, leaving Cooper dumbfounded.\n\nI still haven\u2019t spoken to Cooper because I\u2019m still angry. I told a coworker about this and they say I may have been TA cuz I overreacted to a minor inconvenience. But I felt I was justified because the frustration has been building for years at this point.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: several of you asked why I didn\u2019t use words to communicate. That is because this happened several times and we\u2019ve spoken about it many times. If I leave a saucepan or stick to cool off, I\u2019d come back to find that Cooper has washed the cookeries and thrown out the content because he didn\u2019t know it was food. So I\u2019ve always made it abundantly clear Cooper is not too touch anything when I\u2019m cooking.\n\nAs far as we know he\u2019s always been like this and not because of old age.

It was kind of a jerk move. But I get it. This is something you've talked about many times and your partner doesn't seem to comprehend how annoying it is. It's hard to keep our cool when we're pushed to hard, even if the issue is relatively minor. \n\nAs for your partner, he's getting older and if he's not actually having memory problems, no doubt he's worried about them. And worried about remaining functional period. It's possible some of his need to keep so active is a bit outsized because of this. \n\nAs to still being mad. Is it possible you're maybe less angry than embarrassed? It was a silly thing to lose it over. \n\nMaybe the two of you can see the humor in it. Because I certainly do. \n\nI can see him coming into the kitchen stomach growling and getting sidetracked by the need to tidy up.

Usually that's a good thing.\r  \n\r  \nI get that he's frustrating to live with at times, but you need to keep in mind that at 65, his memory isn't what it used to be.

Along with several other observations you made in your post, tidying things to get them out of sight rather than being organised is a classic sign of ADD. You'll find doom boxes and drawers of stuff where nothing is related to anything else. It's driven by a real need for visible order, rather than a need for any underlying order. Cooper can't himself, and isn't even aware he's doing it. No amount of scolding or complaining or reasoning or bargaining is going to help. It's absolutely infuriating but it is what it is at this point. See if he'll go see a doctor, and help him present all the behaviours.", "Cooper sucks here. At 65 he is unlikely to be suffering from significant cognitive decline, so it is likely that he is being an AH when he photobombs your Zoom calls and over-rides your decisions about where to place stuff without discussion. You have not given enough context to judge whether tossing out your cooking is a over-reaction or a reasonable move to shock him into behaving himself. So, my judgment is INFO.", "YTA. You could have just said that you're still using the ingredients.\n\nAt the same time I'm with Cooper on this one. Taking refrigerated ingredients out and leaving them out for a lengthy period of time to get nice and room temperature again and then put them back in the fridge is a breeding ground for bacteria.\n\nHim also forgetting where he put things while cleaning shouldn't make you loose your mind either. I'm 33 and do that. Why do you feel the need to make his life miserable about it instead of joking about it and just accepting him for his quirks?\n\nIf everything he does bothers you to the point of throwing out food mid preperation, why are you even with him?

If he is that irritating on a consistent basis, why are you still living with him?", "I disagree with people saying she\u2019s the AH. She has been trying to deal with this the \u201cright way\u201d and he is disregarding that. I think he may simply be unable to change and this may be a deal breaker for her. I think NAH - it\u2019s just not the right situation for them.", "His wife of 20 years couldn\u2019t change him, you won\u2019t either, plus with his age he is only going to become more absent minded and forgetful.\n\nAlso YTA, that was a huge over reaction, but I think this is a sign your relationship is coming to a natural end anyways.", "YTA.\n\nIt will take you less than a minute to get the ingredients back out. Instead, you threw a tantrum. Grow up. Tell him you need that stuff as he's reaching for it.", "yta for wasting food instead of communicating.\n\nbut girl... 65 years old?? that's dementia", "Same. Sounds like Grampa wants a bang maid for his golden years, and OP doesn\u2019t have the confidence to be with someone closer to his age that would be a partner.\n\nEdit because I screwed up the gender. Sorry OP", "SAAAAAME. How you date a 65 year old and complain he has memory issues?!", "I'm the same age and that's older than my actual mother...", "We previously agreed that he is to never touch anything I leave on the kitchen table while I cook.\n\nThis comes after SEVERAL instances where I prepare some sauce/stock for the dinner, takes a break from cooking, then comes back to find he\u2019s washed all the dishes and thrown out what I\u2019ve been preparing the whole time without asking.", "Yep, my dad too and guess what? Has very bad untreated OCD that he passed down to my brother. It was infuriating for my immediate family for years that he\u2019d \u201ctidy up\u201d our stuff, or take away say a toy as a consequence, and then COMPLETELY lose it and we wouldn\u2019t find it for YEARS if ever. And he had very little remorse over it and basically it became our problem. Bought a gift for a baby shower and wrapped it, only to have him put it away and forget where he put it? Oops! Not his problem, go buy a new one and then find that old one literally 5 years later. \n\noP is NTA, but like he\u2019s never gonna change so decide now if you want to stick around.", "The guy has OCD and should have sought treatment decades ago.  He's not going to change so decide if you can continue to live like that!  \n\nWhat about telling him he can't come into the kitchen until you say your done so he doesn't see things spread out which he can't seem to handle?  NTA", "OP states that his ex-wife, who had been with him for 20-years, had the same compliant, but if he hasn't changed at 65-years-old, then he probably won't going into in the future either.", "This is the answer. My husband is like Cooper and I am like OP, so I understand the frustration. This exact scenario has also happened to me many times, and while I haven\u2019t always said it as nicely as I could have, a simple \u201cif an ingredient is out it\u2019s because I am using it.\u201d Will suffice. Cooper is getting to an age where cognitive decline and memory lapse are likely so you may need to harness your patience for the future. \n\nThat said, if this isn\u2019t due to Cooper\u2019s age, I doubt he\u2019s likely to do this again in the future!", "This should be the top comment.", "Omg, I read that as he WAS her dad, not her bf!!\n\nWhoops.", "Exactly. This was just such an immature & uncalled for response. Communicate and use words.\n\nI also can't help but to think about that poor lil lamb dying just to be tossed down the sink.... sad.", "I agree. OP is TA for just silently turning sound and throwing the whole dish away without saying \"hey stop I'm using that stuff\". But I also feel like OP is a little bit NTA at the same time, because in a comment he says that this isn't the first time that Cooper has started putting his ingredients away *while* he's using them. \n\nI guess I'm going with YTA. With the condition that Cooper get tested for ADHD or cognitive decline, since not noticing that the stuff is in use screams a huge lack of situational awareness, and OP sits down and thinks about the long-term outlook of the relationship. And they both get counseling either way.", "YTA", "She had tried many times previously - I think he\u2019s not gonna change so the right thing may be to move on.", "This isn\u2019t memory issues. Trying to put away ingredients while someone is ACTIVELY cooking isn\u2019t that, especially coupled with the ex of 20 years having the same complaint.", "I think it sounds kinda OCD but I\u2019m not a professional.", "First of all, a lot of people with ADHD are the exact opposite- never put anything away because if you can't see it, you forget it exists. Secondly, having ADHD is no excuse not to talk to your parter and compromise in how the house is maintained. People with ADHD are not children or animals, we absolutely CAN control ourselves, particularly when what we do is annoying or hurtful to others.", "Or OCD though usually things have to go into *specific* places. It also doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve said anything to him about anything other than your desk.

Usually im not one to make that type of assumption but the way she talks about him is so off putting. It\u2019s pretty clear love isn\u2019t in the equation on her part here which leaves me with only a few other reasons and none of them are moral or decent", "He\u2019s thrown out my half-prepared meals several times. I\u2019d leave a sauce pan or a stock to cool off, take a break and come back to find he\u2019s cleaned up everything and thrown out the sauce/stock.\n\nI\u2019ve made it abundantly clear he is to never touch anything I was working on.", "They're  both guys \ud83d\ude02", "AITA users pay attention to the genders in posts and not just assume everyone is heterosexual challenge", "I disagree with people calling you the AH.

As I understand it, people with OCD use these behaviours to cope with intrusive thoughts and fears. This guy sounds more like he just can't stand clutter.", "Yeah - i think she has basically had it after trying to fix this over and over and didn\u2019t deal with it well BUT I wouldn\u2019t call her an AH either.

We just bought a house together. Cooper pays the 25% downpayment. The mortgage is all me.", "They are both men.", "I think I'd have clobbered him long ago - lol! Is it passive-aggressive controlling/provoking sh!t or genuine mental issues? And not being rude but at his age, he's unlikely to change much - some habits get ingrained so deep. Seriously, is he getting professional help to *try* to control this, bc if not, what are you willing to put up with? Do his virtues outweigh his liabilities?

He\u2019s 65. I\u2019m not sure what you expected with a 65 year old person but if prime memory and function was it then you expected wrong. You blew up at him for something that literally could have just been stopped with, hey please don\u2019t do that. And most importantly, you don\u2019t treat the people you love that way.
