(To be clear, I do think OP should still cover half of the usual energy bill, because OP would have been responsible for that anyway; OP's SO should cover the entire increase over the usual amount.)\n\nBut FYI, OP, there are space heaters with built-in thermostats, so they will heat the room up to a set point (usually 2\u00b0-4\u00b0 above the temperature you choose), then shut off, and only turn on again when the temperature drops below a set point (usually 2\u00b0 below the temperature you choose). I recommend getting one. Your energy bill would probably still have been higher than usual \u2013 assuming you had either set your central heat system to a lower temperature before you left, or don't have central heat \u2013 but it wouldn't have been nearly as high, and there would have been a lower risk of fire because the space heater wouldn't have been running 24/7 for 8 straight days.

I'm just saying that one that only runs intermittently will be less to overheat and start a fire.)", "NTA, my brother did that with the immersion heater and I wanted him to pay for it but my mum wouldn't hear tell of it, so I just had to pay it and it was three times what my electric should have been.", "NTA but expect him to leave you high and dry when you need him for something in the future if that's going to be the attitude.", "Agree.

My husband and I have a budget, where the bills are divvied up a certain way that allows both of us the same amt of extra cash for the month.
