Or are you cool anytime he/she might call you out to pay extra for something like if you take more or longer showers or whatever? Define SO. Married? Engaged?

For serious relationships that have long-term potential, it's not wise (or productive) to keep track of every little thing. Sometimes things are going to happen.
