Let's sum it up so that it doesn't bore anybody. And BTW, TL:DR is in the title already \ud83d\ude01\n\nI (39M) have an ex wife (36F) and two kids, 15F and 9M.\nShe's all about influencers stuff, trying to be one since I remember, with little to no results. She posts way too much pics of our kids on IG/FB etc. \nWe went through the profile with my lawyer, and eventually she kept it private rather than public. \nI'm not preoccupied, she's a good mom, my kids are fine with both me and her. I guess she can dream of being an influencer as much as anybody else \ud83d\ude02. \nWe see them half month each (Monday with her, Tuesday with me, alternate weekends and so on) so they're equally with the both of us. \nI thought we got (it's been almost 5 years) to a point where there was some kind of balance: I'm very accommodating, I pay what I owe every month, she's in my house with the kids, I never ask for receipts at all, I just trust her enough not to. \n\nBUT, some time ago, my son (again, 9 today), kept asking for an earring, cause some of his friends have it, cause it's today's fashion apparently and so on... \nNow, I have nothing personally against piercings and such, I did have one on my tongue and one on my ear when I was 25 to 30, and I would let my daughter get one now that she's 15. \nAnd I personally told him he could get one once he grows a little bit older if he wants it so much, just not now.\n\nYesterday my son videocalled me, showing that \"mom got me this (a little fake diamond on the left earlobe) for my birthday and cause I'm good at school\". I hung up the phone immediately. \nI was (and still am) fucking pissed. \nPlus, today it's his birthday, I was supposed to go there for a cake and the gift, but I don't feel like it now, I'm gonna go and drop the gift at the gym after practice.\n\nHe obviously knew I was against, so I'm a little pissed at him too, but he's 9, he can't fully understand what's going on.\nHis mom, on the other hand... to me, she has no excuse. \n\nNow, if I demand for the piercing to come off, I look like an asshole cause he wanted it so much (and of course \"mom let me\"). \nIf I don't, his mom has yet another confirmation that she can do whatever the hell she wants. \nI could threaten with legal actions (you know, he's a minor and every decision should be taken together), but I don't know if it do (for me and my kid) more damage than anything. \ud83d\ude14\n\nAnd now the birthday is freaking ruined for this stupid earring. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling a simple NO??\n\nEDITING FOR CLARIFICATION: I'm still going to go wish him a happy birthday, give him his present, and not acting weird. And we will still have a party this Sunday with friends and family.\nPlus, yes, I did say to my ex more than 10 times that it was early for him to get a piercing in my opinion.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Thank you all for your replies.

And as a mom who went through multiple hair colors and clothing styles with my own kids\u2026lighten up. If getting an ear pierced is the worst thing he does, consider yourself lucky.

He did what all kids do, whether their parents are together or not... He played one against the other and this time, he won. If he's doing well at school, tell him you're proud of him for that. Kids are looking for ways to express themselves. If a pierced ear makes him feel cool, so be it. He can always take it out later. When I was in my 20s, I had 5 piercings in one ear.

I think you are overreacting to something so minor.", "Did ***she*** know that you were against it?\n\nIn any case, the reality is that lots of people let their daughters get their ears pierced, even young, even as babies and toddlers. Should it be different for boys? I'm just wondering what your objection is.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's an earring, not a hill to die on.

Has asked repeatedly for the earring.  Why do you not want him to have an earrings? 9yo is old enough to keep it clean.  Lots of kids get their first ear piercing at that age.\n\nSecondly, you are abandoning your son *on his bday* bc he wasn't a good little robot who followed your directive, but actually did what he wanted, to his own body.\n\nIt doesn't matter you're having a party jn a few days.

Sure, but your reaction is extreme and you're punishing your son.", "YTA. Give me a break man. Most people get their ears pierced even younger than your son. You say it\u2019s just a phase, okay well if it is then all he has to do is take the earring out and never put one in again if he decides he doesn\u2019t want it anymore, problem solved.

It's hard enough being a little human with divorced parents, it's a lot harder when the parents very obviously don't get along - and trust me, they pick up on it. \n\nAside from that, I'm gonna tell you a story. I wanted to get a second set of ear piercings around his age. I had already had the first holes that were done when I was an infant. I kept being told no and given reasons that still don't make sense, imo. I finally gave up asking, grabbed a needle and did it myself.

It seems like he's a good kid (has been doing well in school), and it's his birthday.\n\nThirdly, you can threaten legal action all you want, but your ex isn't going to get in trouble for letting your son get an ear piercing that HE ASKED FOR.\n\nFourthly, you're acting like a petulant child about his birthday party.\n\nFrom this post, I wonder who initiated the divorce...\n\nEDIT: From the comments, you were fine with your daughter getting her ears pierced at 7 or 8, but he can't get his at 9?

It also can confuse the kid too. My concerns would have included where she got the piercing done. Was it at the mall with one of those piercing guns? Not okay as it causes ear trauma based on how it\u2019s forced in, and it is very unhygienic. Be mad at the mom.

What negative consequence did you think would happen? He's plenty old enough to make that decision and care for a piercing. All you have to do is clean it then leave it alone.

Maybe not old enough to work out the morality of it, but def old enough to know what he was doing. It\u2019s ok to have expectations of our children and to be mad when they don\u2019t meet them.

Your options are to explain to OUR son that you did a bad thing, you shouldn't have done it and the earring has to go or I will seek full legal remedies and modification of the existing orders to reflect your demonstrated willful non-compliance.

But it rarely is on this sub because human relations are very rarely binary. \n\nI'm not gonna discuss much the \"ruined birthday\" part beacause it's been extensively covered by other comments. Hell, I'm not even gonna discusse the piercing itself because it is not up to us, strangers, to impose our parenting views on OP. If he doesn't want his son to get his ears pierced, it is eventually his and his ex-wife's decision (remember the part where the kid is NINE years old?).\n\nSure, OP's reaction and handling of the situation is questionnable. But in the end it's not the topic at hand here (Plus, people need to calm down and stop berating others like they've never made a mistake / rash decision themselve.). How can so many people be missing the point? OP should not be the one to face backlash here, because eventually those are the only two things you can hold against him:\n\n1) He was angry at his ex and it seemed like he was \"punishing\" his child for his mother's actions. Fair enough. That's where I agree with moste people. The kid is 9, nobody can expect him to respect his father's wish when given the opportunity by his mom to disobey.\n\n2) OP does not want his son's ears to be pierced. Well guess what? The kid is 9. It is 100% OP's right to feel this way, and those decisions should be left to the parents, BOTH parents. Except if some people are actually gonna come here and argue that preventing your 9 yo from getting a piercing is child abuse, I believe this matter is not up to us strangers to decide.\n\nSo in the end, objectively speaking, the truly problematic action here isn't OP's, but his ex-wife's. She went against OP's wish, without consulting him nor compromising, knowing full well he was against it. I will not be convinced that she didn't know, because this was 100% done on purpose to undermine OP's parenting. Let's be honest, the mom couldn't care less about this story. Except for the fact that it presents a perfect opportunity for her to look like the good guy, make OP seem like the bad guy, and **set a precedent to go aginst his authority in the future**.\n\nNow, I'd like to make one thing clear. I never said that OP should have the right to take 100% of the decisions regarding his son's parenting. But if we agree on a relationship of equality in co-parenting, you cannot defend the mom who purposefully went against her ex-husband's clear position.\n\nI won't pick N T A because of the way OP handled the problem with his kid.

If you let your daughter get her ears pierced at the same or a younger age and won't allow your son to the same, then, yes, you suck for that. However, at the end of the day your ex made a decision that has a long term impact on your son's body and health without your permission. This is not just a temporary tattoo or a haircut that is free of risk and has no long-term consequences, and depending on where she got it done and how conscientious she and your son are about cleaning the piercing this is a potential health risk. So she sucks for going behind your back. ESH\n\nWhen it comes to the birthday: not showing up and therefore hurting your son over something his mother did  sucks. However, so does you showing up pissed and expressing your anger, or showing up outwardly calm but inwardly pissed creating a lot tension, and unless you are some kind of superhuman you can't completely turn of all anger so that even those closest to you won't notice. So as long as you make it clear to your son that you are not angry at HIM for doing what his mother said, you are doing the best you can under the circumstances and I won't pass judgement on that.

I'ma go after all and stay a bit (I already decided to go and drop the gift before posting), but I'm cringing right now on how much nagging I'll have to swallow.", ">A friend\u2019s house. Youth center. Public bathroom of a laundromat with a needle and an ice cube. I\u2019m sorry you were apparently born 40, but you can pierce an ear pretty much anywhere if you\u2019ve got a broom straw.\n\nMy mom let me discuss piercings with her since I was ten or so. I had multiple ear piercings before I turned 18, and all of them were made by professionals with my mom's permission and guidance. \n\nShe knew that if she'd said no I would just do it with a needle and a potato like she did when she was young. Also, by not giving me unreasonable boundaries, I was much more willing to respect the important and reasonable ones. \n\nMost piercers will give kids lobe piercings from age 7 and up with parental consent. It's such a tiny thing, but I remember when I got my ears pierced it meant a lot to me and I actually learned a lot about self care when I was taking care of the healing process. \n\nI'd rather have a kid get earrings early than resent me and find ways to rebel.", "Oh they definitely can experience this with the right emotions. You bring up an excellent point.", "Yep, that's why he kept asking for it. I spoke to my daughter and she told me the same, that he forgot about it until she brought it up in conversation. And the asking restarted. And so on", "It is actually cause now what am I supposed to do? Just accept it and go on? Like it never happened? And of course I'm pissed. I'm always accommodating and that's how I'm treated (by her of course, not by him, he's just a kid)", "Well, I didn't honestly know. But I guess you have to know the entire situation to give an honest opinion. This was an interesting experiment and experience though.", "Of course, at 18. I don't know if it's illegal to pierce ears without both parents consent, but that's not a thing to press charges for I get that obviously", " \u201cAt 9, I'm sure if you had a man-to-man talk with him and expressed your disappointment in his choice, and about him falling prey to his Mother's need for attention; you may be able to strengthen his ability to not let other people talk him into bad choices? \u201d\n\nPump the brakes. You can say you\u2018re not a fan of the earring, or not something you would choose for yourself, but disappointed?? No. He didn\u2019t let you down. His mother did. Don\u2019t make him feel like his personal lifestyle choices \u201cdisappoint\u201d you. Ever. \n\nAs far as the \u201c falling prey to his mothers need for attention\u201c\u2026.. GTFO with this. He\u2019s 9 and wanted he damn piercing. Don\u2019t ever pit one parent against the other. They will end up resenting you. They will learn on their own. Never mouth off on the other parent.", "As someone pointed out, she's difficult to have \"adult\" talks unfortunately. And partly that's my fault for being so accommodating over the years.", "I may be overreacting right now cause I'm pissed, you're right about that. I'm still going to drop his gift and tell him happy birthday, I just don't want the nagging of my ex while I'm there, cause for sure she will bring that up all the time.\nAnd your right, he'll probably get bored. That's why I wanted to wait.", "Well, the gym is where HE practices.\nAnd no, I'm not sexist, and I upvoted and replied without arguing to several people telling me I'm the asshole. Actually, this has calmed me down quite a bit all in all and I should thank you all for that. \nI just don't get why all discussions come to a gender debate is all.", "Yeah, except it wasn't. Done in a jewellery with those pistol things (I don't know what they're called sorry).\nBut you're right about being so worked up on nothing. I'm already passed that so I'm fine.", "Here at 14 you can drive a 50cc motorcycle, at 16 a 125 and then whatever at 18. So at 14 it won't be illegal.", "I'm not holding it against my son, and (luckily or not) I get mad so rarely that it usually wears off pretty fast. Thanks for the reply", "Not because he's a guy and she's a girl, just because they're different. Because I know her and I know him. Why does everything has to come across as a gender debate?", "We were together still when she did. And we discussed about it, and even waited some time.", "My apologies, I was working under the assumption that both parents should have equal footing in parenting... Plus it is not up to you (nor me for what matters) to decide whether it is \"just a piercing\". If a dad would have gone against th mother's wish in a similar fashion, people would be loosing their sh\\*t left and right.", "Yeah, just put up that force field bubble and let her nagging roll over you... I'm not sure why she'd nag at you though? Or is she just that way?\n\nEasier said than done, I know. Focus on the important part: your relationship with kiddo.\n\nIn the overall scheme of everything, it's an earring. I get that it's indicator of a bigger issue between you and your ex though. I hope she got it done by a professional and not at Claire's or something.\n\nRaising kids is hard and it sounds like she does stuff through the kids to get back at you? You two should totally be on the same page, but unfortunately....ugh. I'm sorry.", "Yup, I knew someone whose grandfather used to come pick her up every weekend to stay at his house. One weekend he was sick and wasn't able to come. She thought he abandoned her and didn't love her anymore, despite the reassurance of her parents \ud83d\ude2d\n\nKids and sensitive and need to be treated with a special kind of care. It takes a level of patience I don't claim to possess.", "You describe yourself as always accommodating, yet the example you give in your original post is \"because you pay child support\". That's not accommodating, that's doing what you're supposed to be doing. You're acting like you're somehow a victim in this. Your son gets to decide what makes him happy, and it's easily removable later if he changes his mind. So yes, accept it and move on. You'll all be better for it.\n\nETA: YTA, obvs.", "Exactly he\u2019s just a kid and yet you are planning to punish him for an issue you have with his mother.", "Yes! You should accept it and move on! Anything else is going to tear at his little psyche and remind him that the things he likes can't be shared with you. Pull them aside and say \" you know, I've always thought 9-year-olds were too young to get piercings but I really thought about it and as long as you're keeping it clean it looks really good on you. Let me or your mom know if you need help cleaning it\".\n\nThis is one of those things that is going to make or break your long-term relationship with your kid. Get over yourself.", "I didn\u2019t get the response I thought I would. Great experiment. \n\n\nI can\u2019t imagine why you aren\u2019t together anymore, tantrum over a god damn piercing.", "Dude just stop over explaining yourself because it isn't helping of making you less like the AH. It's a hole in an ear. Either listen to those telling you YTA and move on. You seem to have control issues and be a bit manipulative. If you really said you'd avoid a party for your son because he got his ear pierced is a huge red flag.", "Maybe it\u2019s time to sit down with a family counselor - you and your wife, at least.  You\u2019ve got some issues about not being heard that are valid.  Use this as the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.  Use this whole experience to start gaining back your voice.  Do something!  \n\nFrom the comments I\u2019ve read, you sound like you aren\u2019t going to take this out on your son.  Good.  I wish you luck in gaining back some control.", "The gender debate is because you\u2019re setting different rules for your 2 children.\n\nIt\u2019s also unfortunately common that parents allow girls to get ear piercings without much fuss but overreact to boys wanting the same.", "HOW OBTUSE CAN YOU WILLFULLY BE? Your daughter got the same piercing at a younger age than your son. They both requested it themselves. You keep crying \u201cgender debate\u201d BECAUSE YOU *CLEARLY* HAVE DOUBLE STANDARDS REGARDING GENDER. That\u2019s in all caps so maybe, just maybe you\u2019ll see wtf everyone is saying to you. I can see why convos with your ex don\u2019t go well- you\u2019re stubborn and don\u2019t hear what anyone is saying to you if it goes against your narrative. You say she\u2019s hard to talk to? Buddy have I got a revelation for YOU. \n\nSeriously, consider therapy for the sake of your kids. I\u2019m glad this thread is peeling back some layers but you\u2019ve got some work to do. This isn\u2019t entirely about a piercing and now you know it.", "You know kids change as they get older. If you had started saying that he wanted an earring because his mother put that in his mind that would be one thing but you stated that he said he wanted them because some of his friends had them. The fact that he forgot about it and she said something about it and he remembered has nothing to do with it. Originally he wanted it for reason I had nothing to do with her. So maybe you don't know him as well as you think you do. As parents we would like to think that we know everything about our children but from what I remember growing up my mother didn't know very much about me at all.\n\nMy son had his ears pierced at 2 years old, until my mother said only girls were earrings and then he refused to put them in for years. He's now a happy 15 year old that finally got past that and decided he wanted his ears pierced and my ex and I took him to a shop to get them pierced. Ultimately he ended up not having to get them pierced because he did still have the holes, but nobody would have been able to tell if we hadn't said anything. Even the piercer didn't notice until he went to go mark my son's ears.\n\nBest thing about this whole thing is it didn't ruin his birthday at all. It ruined his birthday for you. He had no idea that it was even a problem, unless you made it known to him that you had a problem with it. Which is freaking ridiculous. I don't condone doing something behind a co-parents back, but this isn't just something she decided to go and do and had to talk him into. I feel like at that rate he would have had to wait till he was 18. It's a piercing he's not going to join a cult or burn down a church because of a piercing. Got to let kids enjoy some things especially when it's the least harmful of things they could be doing.", "Because unfortunately that\u2019s how it does look. Your son and daughter are different people yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t want the same things, nor should they not get them. Please don\u2019t avoid his party. It might hurt your ex yeah, but it\u2019ll hurt him even more. It will only make you look bad, and I\u2019m willing to assume that\u2019s not what you want correct?", "Because you didn\u2019t give another reason for why you thought he could handle it, all you said was that it was too early. If you had said he had poor personal hygiene and needs reminders to complete daily tasks related to hygiene that would be one thing. \n\nAlso, it seems like it was something he earned by demonstrating responsibility through school work. That was the standard my parents used as well. It wasn\u2019t about our ages, it was about proving that we could be responsible enough to take care of the piercing ourselves.", "Dad didn\u2019t discuss it with her either. He just said no and thought he had absolute authority.", "Thanks for this too, very kind.", "Well, I don't think this is the place to list everything, so I won't. And BTW, my actual gf has two kids and gets none of those aforementioned any month from her ex.\nAccommodating in the sense that every time she asks for something more, being that money or time or anything (stuff, money for her, getting this or that from here or there), I never said no. And I mean it. Cause if she's happier, kids are happier. That should be the same for me, but I guess we fall again into gender debate then. I'm not a victim, I'm here now at the \"party\" ignoring every little laugh and  zinger about it.\nAm I the better guy in this case? Maybe. Would she do the same if I bought him a motorcycle at 14? I doubt it. But I won't do it cause she's still the mother of my children, even if I despise some of her attitudes.", "He's still with me this weekend, and of course I'm not going to throw away what I planned or the gifts for a stupid thing.\nBut right now I'm the asshole if I'm pissed, I'm the asshole if I'm not pissed (cause then everything is fine if mom says so), basically I'm the asshole anyway.\nFact that today he's with his mom for his birthday it's just a coincidence.", "Thanks for the kindness.", "Yeah but I already said that that's not the matter. They're two different kids, with two different attitudes, doesn't matter they're male female or else. But I know I know that and it would be too long to explain it all.", "Thanks for your reply, I must admit I wrote the first post with some anger aftereffects, leaving out so much it doesn't even matter now. I replied to this and that when asked, but I realize it's impossible to get a good view now. Thanks again.", "I think OP said somewhere that the matter had been discussed with his wife, but i will agree with you in the sense that we are missing some info. We don\u2019t know if OP actually made any attempt at compromising.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t appear that the mom tried any harder to find common ground. And in the end, while there was a disagreement, she still consciously decided to act on it behind her co-parent\u2019s back.\n\nAs I said in another comment, it\u2019s rarely black or white. I\u2019m not saying OP is 100% right, nor that he should just get to decide everything.

One is dangerous and a huge decision, while the other is you being sexist as you were fine with your daughter getting her ears pierced at a younger age. It\u2019s also not dangerous at all.", "It's your whole mentality on feeling slighted by an ear piercing that's making you come across as playing the victim and acting like being a present father rather than a dead beat means youre....owed something extra?? \n\nI don't know what you want at this point? You came here for a verdict. You got one. And if you're at your kids party now, maybe you should actually be there mentally instead of distracted and arguing with people on Reddit, who you came to specifically to ask for a judgement. \n\nOh also, you're entire paragraph about you're wife trying to be an influencer was SUPER unnecessary, irrelevant to the situation, and condescending as hell. Byeeeee.", "That is a ridiculous comparison. Buying the kid a motorcycle at 14 is vastly different from piercing his ear.", "Bro you're at the party now?

What if it's just a freakin' earring?", "Why did you not want him to get his ears pierced at 9 when your daughter already had them by 9 then?", "I doubt your kids will see it that way. Most kids would just see you holding one to a different standard.", "We haven\u2019t all read 100% of your comments before responding.

As a bonding thing. It happened now just be supportive. Or super supportive? If not for anything but to make him feel like he didn't do anything wrong and it isn't a problem with him.\n\nAlso find a better way for you and your ex to communicate. It isn't 100% on you and it's not 100% on her. Communication works both ways. Although a little more than 50% on her just because even as a last-minute decision she should have let you know instead of just surprising you with that. Even if it was hey I'm taking him to do this instead of just nothing.\n\nIt's about your son and your daughter not who's the cooler parent, who's the more lenient parent, or whatever.
