Let's sum it up so that it doesn't bore anybody. And BTW, TL:DR is in the title already \ud83d\ude01\n\nI (39M) have an ex wife (36F) and two kids, 15F and 9M.\nShe's all about influencers stuff, trying to be one since I remember, with little to no results. She posts way too much pics of our kids on IG/FB etc. \nWe went through the profile with my lawyer, and eventually she kept it private rather than public. \nI'm not preoccupied, she's a good mom, my kids are fine with both me and her. I guess she can dream of being an influencer as much as anybody else \ud83d\ude02. \nWe see them half month each (Monday with her, Tuesday with me, alternate weekends and so on) so they're equally with the both of us. \nI thought we got (it's been almost 5 years) to a point where there was some kind of balance: I'm very accommodating, I pay what I owe every month, she's in my house with the kids, I never ask for receipts at all, I just trust her enough not to. \n\nBUT, some time ago, my son (again, 9 today), kept asking for an earring, cause some of his friends have it, cause it's today's fashion apparently and so on... \nNow, I have nothing personally against piercings and such, I did have one on my tongue and one on my ear when I was 25 to 30, and I would let my daughter get one now that she's 15. \nAnd I personally told him he could get one once he grows a little bit older if he wants it so much, just not now.\n\nYesterday my son videocalled me, showing that \"mom got me this (a little fake diamond on the left earlobe) for my birthday and cause I'm good at school\". I hung up the phone immediately. \nI was (and still am) fucking pissed. \nPlus, today it's his birthday, I was supposed to go there for a cake and the gift, but I don't feel like it now, I'm gonna go and drop the gift at the gym after practice.\n\nHe obviously knew I was against, so I'm a little pissed at him too, but he's 9, he can't fully understand what's going on.\nHis mom, on the other hand... to me, she has no excuse. \n\nNow, if I demand for the piercing to come off, I look like an asshole cause he wanted it so much (and of course \"mom let me\"). \nIf I don't, his mom has yet another confirmation that she can do whatever the hell she wants. \nI could threaten with legal actions (you know, he's a minor and every decision should be taken together), but I don't know if it do (for me and my kid) more damage than anything. \ud83d\ude14\n\nAnd now the birthday is freaking ruined for this stupid earring. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling a simple NO??\n\nEDITING FOR CLARIFICATION: I'm still going to go wish him a happy birthday, give him his present, and not acting weird. And we will still have a party this Sunday with friends and family.\nPlus, yes, I did say to my ex more than 10 times that it was early for him to get a piercing in my opinion.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Thank you all for your replies.

And as a mom who went through multiple hair colors and clothing styles with my own kids\u2026lighten up. If getting an ear pierced is the worst thing he does, consider yourself lucky.

He did what all kids do, whether their parents are together or not... He played one against the other and this time, he won. If he's doing well at school, tell him you're proud of him for that. Kids are looking for ways to express themselves. If a pierced ear makes him feel cool, so be it. He can always take it out later. When I was in my 20s, I had 5 piercings in one ear.

I think you are overreacting to something so minor.", "Did ***she*** know that you were against it?\n\nIn any case, the reality is that lots of people let their daughters get their ears pierced, even young, even as babies and toddlers. Should it be different for boys? I'm just wondering what your objection is.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's an earring, not a hill to die on. But I wouldn't absolutely let you son know that you are angry that he played his parents against each other after you specifically said no, and let the ex know that decisions like this should be made by both parents.", "YTA. \n\nI was leaning E S H until I saw that you were okay with your daughter getting her ears pierced at a similar age. \n\nIdeally your wife should have discussed it with you first, but I would also have a hard time enforcing different rules for my children based on my ex\u2019s biased ideas about gender.", "Yta your son wants the earring. Has asked repeatedly for the earring.  Why do you not want him to have an earrings? 9yo is old enough to keep it clean.  Lots of kids get their first ear piercing at that age.\n\nSecondly, you are abandoning your son *on his bday* bc he wasn't a good little robot who followed your directive, but actually did what he wanted, to his own body.\n\nIt doesn't matter you're having a party jn a few days.

Sure, but your reaction is extreme and you're punishing your son.", "YTA. Give me a break man. Most people get their ears pierced even younger than your son. You say it\u2019s just a phase, okay well if it is then all he has to do is take the earring out and never put one in again if he decides he doesn\u2019t want it anymore, problem solved.

It's hard enough being a little human with divorced parents, it's a lot harder when the parents very obviously don't get along - and trust me, they pick up on it. \n\nAside from that, I'm gonna tell you a story. I wanted to get a second set of ear piercings around his age. I had already had the first holes that were done when I was an infant. I kept being told no and given reasons that still don't make sense, imo. I finally gave up asking, grabbed a needle and did it myself.

It seems like he's a good kid (has been doing well in school), and it's his birthday.\n\nThirdly, you can threaten legal action all you want, but your ex isn't going to get in trouble for letting your son get an ear piercing that HE ASKED FOR.\n\nFourthly, you're acting like a petulant child about his birthday party.\n\nFrom this post, I wonder who initiated the divorce...\n\nEDIT: From the comments, you were fine with your daughter getting her ears pierced at 7 or 8, but he can't get his at 9?

It also can confuse the kid too. My concerns would have included where she got the piercing done. Was it at the mall with one of those piercing guns? Not okay as it causes ear trauma based on how it\u2019s forced in, and it is very unhygienic. Be mad at the mom.

What negative consequence did you think would happen? He's plenty old enough to make that decision and care for a piercing. All you have to do is clean it then leave it alone.

Let's sum it up so that it doesn't bore anybody.

I hung up the phone immediately. \nI was (and still am) fucking pissed. \nPlus, today it's his birthday, I was supposed to go there for a cake and the gift, but I don't feel like it now, I'm gonna go and drop the gift at the gym after practice.\n\nHe obviously knew I was against, so I'm a little pissed at him too, but he's 9, he can't fully understand what's going on.\nHis mom, on the other hand... to me, she has no excuse. \n\nNow, if I demand for the piercing to come off, I look like an asshole cause he wanted it so much (and of course \"mom let me\"). \nIf I don't, his mom has yet another confirmation that she can do whatever the hell she wants. \nI could threaten with legal actions (you know, he's a minor and every decision should be taken together), but I don't know if it do (for me and my kid) more damage than anything. \ud83d\ude14\n\nAnd now the birthday is freaking ruined for this stupid earring. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling a simple NO??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But it rarely is on this sub because human relations are very rarely binary. \n\nI'm not gonna discuss much the \"ruined birthday\" part beacause it's been extensively covered by other comments. Hell, I'm not even gonna discusse the piercing itself because it is not up to us, strangers, to impose our parenting views on OP. If he doesn't want his son to get his ears pierced, it is eventually his and his ex-wife's decision (remember the part where the kid is NINE years old?).\n\nSure, OP's reaction and handling of the situation is questionnable. But in the end it's not the topic at hand here (Plus, people need to calm down and stop berating others like they've never made a mistake / rash decision themselve.). How can so many people be missing the point? OP should not be the one to face backlash here, because eventually those are the only two things you can hold against him:\n\n1) He was angry at his ex and it seemed like he was \"punishing\" his child for his mother's actions. Fair enough. That's where I agree with moste people. The kid is 9, nobody can expect him to respect his father's wish when given the opportunity by his mom to disobey.\n\n2) OP does not want his son's ears to be pierced. Well guess what? The kid is 9. It is 100% OP's right to feel this way, and those decisions should be left to the parents, BOTH parents. Except if some people are actually gonna come here and argue that preventing your 9 yo from getting a piercing is child abuse, I believe this matter is not up to us strangers to decide.\n\nSo in the end, objectively speaking, the truly problematic action here isn't OP's, but his ex-wife's. She went against OP's wish, without consulting him nor compromising, knowing full well he was against it. I will not be convinced that she didn't know, because this was 100% done on purpose to undermine OP's parenting. Let's be honest, the mom couldn't care less about this story. Except for the fact that it presents a perfect opportunity for her to look like the good guy, make OP seem like the bad guy, and **set a precedent to go aginst his authority in the future**.\n\nNow, I'd like to make one thing clear. I never said that OP should have the right to take 100% of the decisions regarding his son's parenting. But if we agree on a relationship of equality in co-parenting, you cannot defend the mom who purposefully went against her ex-husband's clear position.\n\nI won't pick N T A because of the way OP handled the problem with his kid.

If you let your daughter get her ears pierced at the same or a younger age and won't allow your son to the same, then, yes, you suck for that. However, at the end of the day your ex made a decision that has a long term impact on your son's body and health without your permission. This is not just a temporary tattoo or a haircut that is free of risk and has no long-term consequences, and depending on where she got it done and how conscientious she and your son are about cleaning the piercing this is a potential health risk. So she sucks for going behind your back. ESH\n\nWhen it comes to the birthday: not showing up and therefore hurting your son over something his mother did  sucks. However, so does you showing up pissed and expressing your anger, or showing up outwardly calm but inwardly pissed creating a lot tension, and unless you are some kind of superhuman you can't completely turn of all anger so that even those closest to you won't notice. So as long as you make it clear to your son that you are not angry at HIM for doing what his mother said, you are doing the best you can under the circumstances and I won't pass judgement on that.

I haven't seen *good* justification for the difference in how he's treating the two kids.", "as someone who has lived through having two sets of rules, THANK YOU. people don't realize how hard it is on kids. my mom was fine with me wearing skinny jeans as a teenager, and i thought i dressed pretty appropriately considering i never even wore shorts or skirts. i didn't realize there was an issue until i was walking down the stairs at my dad's house and i caught my stepmom tell him that i was dressing like a wh0re. then they bad-mouthed my mom for allowing me to dress \"like that.\" apparently, she was wrong for not discussing what i should wear with my stepmom?? i was like 14-15 yr old goody-two-shoes who visited my dad twice a month on the weekends btw. as a kid, i wasn't thinking about that sort of thing, i just felt comfortable in them. did she ever stop to consider that i was just a kid who would be traumatized by that kind of character assassination at such a young age? no. people don't realize how selfish parents can be and how often divorced parents ruin their kids' mental health over their fragile egos.", "This. I was in college and got a piercing at Claire\u2019s in my upper ear, was doing the aftercare obsessively, since I had one close in high school and was pissed at myself so wanted it to go well.  The skin literally grew over the ear overnight, and the damn thing was stuck.  Like a moron, I opted to punch it out myself at two a.m instead of going to the urgent care attached to the local er where they handled stuff that needed attention that wasn\u2019t going to kill you.  I have a tiny scar now!", "I\u2019m sorry your stepmom said that to you. I\u2019ve gone through similar situations and it is painful", "not to mention the fact that they don't really clean them besides maybe a wipe down after a piercing. And they are made of cheap plastic so they get stuck quite often too you see lots of videos on piercing subs as a sort of PSA for piercing \"guns\". Pretty normal not to know though, most people are under the assumption we wouldn't let a company do something that might actively harm people (especially children)", "Definitely, from the way that OP was talking about a boy having a piercing, as if it's a brand new fashion. I'm in my early 40's, this has been a fashion style, before I was even born.\n\nIt sounds like OP didn't loop his co-parent into this discussion, either. It would have been best if they conferred before the piercing, but it's something they both failed to do.", "It's almost definitely about gender. If he let his daughter get the piercing at the same age but is refusing for his son, that's the most obvious difference between them.", "And for immediately hanging up on his kid", "Not like that\u2019s literally what you\u2019ve asked people to do or anything", "But they had already decided that it was for piercings to happen at 7-8. Son was 9 so past the age he'd already agreed pierced ears could happen.", "Nard Dog?", "I got my ears pierced when I was a little younger than him because I wanted to  and I had been doing well in school. Sometimes I wear them, other times  don't. If the kid doesn't want them later in life he can take them out. It's not a big deal. It would be life if the mother bought him a toy he wanted or let him get a haircut that Op didn't like.", "Or maybe he's just a AH. Yes, I think that's more likely the answer.", "yeah honestly, stopping visitations was the best thing i ever did for myself. i really hope you got the comfort and help that's needed to heal from this sort of thing!", "Sure it wasn't nice, but it's better than saying something bad to his kid. His kid is also 9 and old enough to know Dad wasn't on board with the earring.", "An influencer with a private account, no less. How the hell does that work?", "My daughter went to a professional piercer (inside a tattoo shop) when she was five. The pro double checked that she consented, and then did her ears. We went back for a mom/daughter double pierce when she was 11. Same thing, they double checked that she consented and I wasn\u2019t forcing her. We now both have a double pierce in our left lobes.", "8-9 is actually a pretty ideal age for a simple lobe piercing. The ears won\u2019t grow much so the hole will not be misshapen or in the wrong position. Kids bodies also recover really well and fast. + they like to be able to wear fun earrings and accessories. I see nothing wrong with a kid 8+ getting their ears pierced. Any younger than 8 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very smart idea. Most piercers are starting to to go against the piercing of babies because as the ears grow the hole may end up in a bad position. My mom had her ears grow so the piercing hole was really low on her lobe. Eventually a heavy earring tore her ear. She got them re-pierced higher up and her earlobe tear stitched. The holes and scars will never fully go away because of a weird baby aesthetic trend.", "Well, we have hundreds of double standards based on gender.  Welcome to America.", "thats not putting against each other, that lying. Just because it happens doesnt mean it right, lol, are you dense?", "I think everyone knows the reason.", "It closed *overnight*?  Dang, I didn't know it was that quick.", "Super sus that he essentially lied in his post about how it was handled for their daughter.", "how is it lying? mom was aware dad said no. She didn't care lol. He is a child who wants what he wants and all he needed was one parent to say yes, which he got. \n\nare you dense?", "Yeah cartilage heals pretty quick, faster than just regular flesh. Especially in children.", "I read the comment, and to me it sounds like he had apprehension, but eventually caved to letting his daughter get it, and that the same situation probably would\u2019ve happened again had the ex actually talked to him.\n\nAnd I do agree that since he did it for the daughter he should have to \u201cthink about it\u201d for his son, but it doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s basing it off of their sex.  \n\nSo, I lean NAH unless he\u2019s straight up lying.", "I'm 46, and both my older and younger brother had a pierced ear as kids. Older got his at 14, and younger a few weeks later at 8, because he wanted to copy. That was in '88.", "YTA for so many reasons. \n\nOne, you have no reason to deny your son and even said you let your daughter do it at that age. Favoritism? Sexist? Either way, AH. \n\nTwo, something that stood out was \u201cyou pay what you owe and don\u2019t ask for receipts, just trust her\u201d and that she\u2019s in \u201cyour house\u201d. What does this mean? The divorce is clearly finalized because you said you\u2019d take her to court over it (I wouldn\u2019t, you will gain nothing except making everyone mad) so it isn\u2019t *your* house anymore. It\u2019s hers. And what receipts?? For child support?? You can ask all you want, she has ZERO obligations to give you any of that and no, the court will not make her. \n\nYou are a controlling AH and I can see why you\u2019re divorced. You were not going to see your son for his birthday because you\u2019re mad at him and his mom that they didn\u2019t do what you said? You don\u2019t get to control her household anymore. It\u2019s not yours. You control what happens in your home. If it was something you were 100% against and hated and never allowed sure she\u2019d be an AH for doing it behind your back but honestly, you\u2019d get no where with this argument because again, you let your other kid do it and ONLY have a problem with this one. You just want complete control you don\u2019t have and it makes you angry.", "YTA. In so many ways. This isn't even about the earring,  really. This is about control,  and ongoing conflict with your ex.  Probably because of your controlling nature.  \n\n\n>We went through the profile with my lawyer, and eventually she kept it private rather than public.\n\nWhy? What was the point in this,  other than an attempt at undermining her during divorce or custody hearings? Why was your lawyer needed? \n\n>I pay what I owe every month, she's in my house with the kids\n\nHuh. You mean the house that was also hers during your marriage?  I'm guessing she kept it in the divorce?  That makes it *her* house. And you're a bitter asshole scrabbling at any excuse to get back at her. \n\n'Sorry, couldn't make it to your bday. It's  mom's fault..'  Wasthat what you'd planned on telling your son?", "What's done is done. You said you had a few piercings. Why not use this as a way to bond with your son? Tell him stories about your piercing experiences. Go shopping for earrings together. \n\nTry to let go of the anger and make some memories with him.", "My mom made me wait until I was 11/12 for that reason. \"You can get them pierced when you're old enough to be responsible about cleaning it,\" basically.\n\nI am very neutral on piercing babies' ears (not my lane), but if someone wants to do it I definitely see the wisdom in doing it while they're still little blobs who like being swaddled.", "Not necessarily, depending on where you\u2019re from, at least not so directly gender related as piercings are only for girls. Where I live it\u2019s quite common for men to have ear or nose piercings, but it\u2019s actually more of a class thing where 20 as it is those men usually considered hippies. The class detention doesn\u2019t make it any better or worse. I\u2019m just highlighting that I think people were a bit quick to jump on the gender thing where it may be a bit more of a complex bias on the OP\u2019s", "Baka-Tari is my user name. I usually shorten it to \u201cBaka\u201d for self reference, and use it as a similar reference point for my wife and kids. \nThat said, baka is Japanese for \u201cstupid\u201d. Keeps me humble.", "Why should he not when she's posting their children? If you're discussing custody and keeping your children safe and maintaining their privacy?", "Ah, thank you!  I knew I was missing something!", "Not a problem, and thanks for asking for clarification.", "My *father* hot his ear peirced in the friggin late 80\u2019s when i was in elementary school. I thought piercings for boys was no big deal. It\u2019s 2022 for crying out loud."]}
