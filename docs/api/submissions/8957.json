Max and Sebastian met each other at school and  they kept in touch after years, mostly a texting video calling friend, but he comes to visit us sometimes and we would go to the same parties/events every so often.\n\n  \n**First things first, I\u2019m not a bridezilla**, okay, Max said \u201cNope, he\u2019s coming\u201d and that was it. It was nothing more than a suggestion. The suggestion is the action I\u2019m asking about, I\u2019m not a crazy bride.     \nMy reasoning for my suggestion is because Sebastian is the most Debbie Downer person I\u2019ve ever met.  The definition for that is \u201cA person with an incessant need to bring down the collective mood and general ambience of a group-chill\u201d and he\u2019s exactly that person. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s a sweet guy, and Max cares a lot for him and I know Seb is a great friend too.\n\n  \nThe last time we were together with Sebastian and a couple of friends in a local bar,  we were talking about our future, getting kids, getting wrinkles, grey hair, turning 30, and whatnot. When Max asked Sebastian where he\u2019d see himself at 40, Sebastian said something amongst the lines of ***\u201cHonestly can\u2019t see myself at 40, surprised I made it to 30***\u201d. The group laughed it off (I\u2019d say awkwardly) and Max patted him on the shoulder smiling, but that killed the vibe and changed the topic of our convo imo. You know what I mean? That\u2019s just an example but that\u2019s always his energy! You know, Debbie Downer. It's like a human Dementor\n\n  \nWell. Yeah that was my reasoning. A few days ago, I suggested the idea to Max. I pitched my case by saying we wanted a small wedding anyway and Sebastian is not the most sociable guy, and his energy is not necessarily the energy I want that day, you know? That\u2019s all. Max shut down my suggestion immediately and later he said he wasn\u2019t mad at me or anything but his face when we were having that conversation told me otherwise. Apparently he also told her mother (she was in our place at that moment) because I was getting a weird vibe from her too later that day. I felt judged.   \n**Like I said, I\u2019m not a bridezilla and Sebastian is going to the wedding. It ain\u2019t that deep!

It's pretty clear he suffers from low esteem and depression and you want your fianc\u00e9 to exclude him from one of the most significant days in your fianc\u00e9's life?

He wants him there - Sebastian gets the invite. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s people on your side that Max could do without too. It\u2019s called compromise.\n\nAnd realistically- how much time do you think you\u2019d even spend with Sebastian at your wedding? You\u2019ll be too busy to even really interact a ton which is why you need to get over it. YTA!", "YTA - You feel judged?

All you did was ask. When your fianc\u00e9 said no you accepted that and moved on. I understand not wanting him there if he is in fact a huge downer.

If he refuses, the there's not much you can do about it. If you asked your fiance politely to consider not inviting him since it's a small wedding anyway, I don't think it's a big deal.

He may be at a table where someone brings out a fun side in him or, he finds someone to commiserate.

I told her I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d make it to 30! I was hospitalized in 2020 at 28 with severe eating disorder. Some of us have to joke to cope. \n\nI\u2019m good now but damn OP, have some faith in people. I can\u2019t imagine if my friends had started blocking me out of their lives then because I said some weird shit", "Well, she said it was awkward afterwards so if it was a joke, it didn't land with that group.", "Other people's parties is a place for positivity not melancholy, even if you have to \"fake\" it, especially if there's someone else who is supposed to be the focus of attention.\n\nI think this is another one of those post that is polarizing across reddit's demographics. The majority of young folks here haven't learned that its poor manners and inappropriate to be the \"edgy eeyore\" as a personality trait in social gatherings. These same eeyores are the ones who write indignant posts when they refuse a few invitations/flake on events due to anxiety, etc. and are then surprise when they no longer are invited to things and have a non-existent circle of friends.\n\nThis is exactly the reason we have the sarcastic insult \"You must be fun at parties.\" because they aren't and people don't like tolerating this kind of crap.\n\nOP is not a bridezilla to not like or want someone who makes comments inferring he's surprised he hasn't killed himself yet at a joyous occasion. That said, OP, if your fiance wants him there, this isn't a good hill to die on. Hardly anyone will remember this guy and you probably won't have to spend to long with him if he's not in the wedding party.", "Nah I get the feeling OP just wants one blessed night away from him, her wedding", "Well her calling him a debbie downer I assume is because of multiple experiences. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s fact that he struggles mentally, but I think it\u2019s enough reason to be careful with how you speak to him.", "In my counter, racists that gain perspective usually aren't racists anymore either. It's a vastly different level of perspective from a bridezilla, sure. But if they can manage it, I've seen people change.", "No, racists also need perspective. Have you ever listened to interviews with former racists?", "we have no reason to assume he is, either. all we have is op's details and our own speculation and im sorry, but demanding the emotional investment and labor of others in casual settings is not okay. unless i could be assured he IS getting help and has gotten better, i would not want that energy at my wedding either.", "we have no reason to assume he is, either. all we have is op's details and our own speculation and im sorry, but demanding the emotional investment and labor of others in casual settings is not okay. unless i could be assured he IS getting help and has gotten better, i would not want that energy at my wedding either.", "cool, it was still a fucked up and uncomfortable comment to make that demands the emotional labor of others bc it makes them feel obligated to comfort him. he made others uncomfortable, there was no discernible lilt or comedy to it. everyone is jumping on op's dick without considering the possibility that yeah, maybe this guy kinda sucks. we all, including myself, are just speculating based on limited details and i felt like making my perspective heard bc its one no one's actually considering.", "Yes let\u2019s isolate the mentally ill even more good call \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIt\u2019s not a good hill to die on because disinviting a good friend from a major life event is worse manners than not putting on a happy face. He\u2019s not going to cause a scene, my god, he\u2019s just a little more crass than the average person. If he says something the worst that will happen is someone walking away to get another drink.", "And OP didn't get the joke it might just be a guy thing but I say it every birthday if he was truly a Debbie downer he wouldn't be invited places.", "This ^ it's a slippery slope where Max loses all his friends because the wife hates them.

There's a groom too and it was his call, as it's his friend who He wants to come.\n\nSo, it's rather a done deal to my thinking. If you are a bride who insists it's all about you, you are absolutely a bridezilla & I feel sorry for the groom, because life can be very long living with such a one-sided relationship.", "I mean, why else would the guy be surprised he made it to 30? Unless he's got a sky diving hobby or car accident hobby, that's a suicide reference.", "The way she said he made the joke, it got awkward, he got an awkward pat on the shoulder, condensation changed. That tells me all I need to know. If shit gets awkward after you make a depression joke, there\u2019s a reason people are uncomfortable", "Did you read the comment you\u2019re responding to? They gave a bunch of examples.", "all of those are obviously unlikely and weren't the case. you don't make a comment \"surprised i made it to 30\" with no follow up comment about cancer if you had a cancer scare.", "To play devil's advocate, what if the roles were reversed and he said no to a Debbie downer good friend of yours you insist on coming to the wedding?  Not to say who's right or who's wrong, just to point out that it's not always so black and white.\n\nNot every person is going to have an upbeat or happy personality, but we also don't know what's going on in ppl's lives behind closed doors.  Everyone has their issues, and it's great to have friends support them.\n\nHaving been to my fair share of weddings, it's been my experience that ppl end up having a good time, no matter what goes wrong or who shows up.  No one pays that much attention to particular wedding guests, even in small weddings - they're all there for you and your fiance and you have a good time.  Even if there's the weird relative or friend at a table, ppl still end up having a good time.", "YTA. For asking.

I can see where you\u2019re coming from but this dementor is your fianc\u00e9\u2019s friend. Not much you can do about it. Hope it goes well despite the dementor being", "YTA. Only a bridezilla would say she isn\u2019t one so many times in a post. Also if him making a bad joke is how you identify a Debbie downer, everyone would be a Debbie downer at some point. Also in your first paragraph you say your husband says he\u2019s coming to the wedding and you dropped it. But in the last paragraph you try and bring up uninviting him again\u2026.", "Hmmmmmm.... it's one awkward situation. I think they will forget and let this pass. You keep your mind sane and at wedding there are many other people to focus on.\n\nYou don't get to interact this guy that much you have your own relatives. See you not liking someone doesn't mean he is not important to your fiance. In the first place you should not have said that, see it killed the mood around you. So be cautious before wedding to not to offend anybody.\n\nEnjoy your wedding being bride, pamper yourself and yeah forget this mess. No need to give much thought. NAH", "Yta", "Slight YTA. You don\u2019t have to like him, but you don\u2019t have to seat him near you at your wedding if you don\u2019t want. There are ways around this besides outright not inviting him.", "Are you 12? Have you never heard of dry or dark humor? \n\nSuch a drama queen!", "NTA. My husband has a friend for 20+ yrs that he even takes breaks from because he's such a downer. The guy literally brings down everyone's mood by making an ass of himself. He's not happy, so other people shouldn't be. He was invited to the wedding and kept telling people he's too sober for this shit. Our wedding was a 4th of July BBQ where most everyone, including us, were drinking hours before the wedding. The plan was good food, friends, family, and epic fireworks. He was only there long enough to see us get married and eat, but he ruined the mood. He always expected my husband to be a bachelor, so him getting married wasn't ok, and he tried to ruin the day. If this is someone who intentionally tries to spoil get togethers, you are valid in your concerns. This friend is now only around me if I'm ok with it because he \"jokingly\" threatened to hit his date when she was going to step out to take a call from her ex who was watching their kids. Having been in abusive relationships \"lost my shit\" is an understatement.", "NTA you're allowed to ask, and you've accepted the answer and moved on.  That doesn't make you a bridezilla. You're also allowed to not like everyone.", "You think he\u2019s gonna really be able to ruin your wedding?", "YTA.

Unless it's just the three of you and a priest I think you're being ridiculous. I can't believe he's such a downer he'll have any effect on the overall mood of the event.
