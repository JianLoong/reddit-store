Max and Sebastian met each other at school and  they kept in touch after years, mostly a texting video calling friend, but he comes to visit us sometimes and we would go to the same parties/events every so often.\n\n  \n**First things first, I\u2019m not a bridezilla**, okay, Max said \u201cNope, he\u2019s coming\u201d and that was it. It was nothing more than a suggestion. The suggestion is the action I\u2019m asking about, I\u2019m not a crazy bride.     \nMy reasoning for my suggestion is because Sebastian is the most Debbie Downer person I\u2019ve ever met.  The definition for that is \u201cA person with an incessant need to bring down the collective mood and general ambience of a group-chill\u201d and he\u2019s exactly that person. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s a sweet guy, and Max cares a lot for him and I know Seb is a great friend too.\n\n  \nThe last time we were together with Sebastian and a couple of friends in a local bar,  we were talking about our future, getting kids, getting wrinkles, grey hair, turning 30, and whatnot. When Max asked Sebastian where he\u2019d see himself at 40, Sebastian said something amongst the lines of ***\u201cHonestly can\u2019t see myself at 40, surprised I made it to 30***\u201d. The group laughed it off (I\u2019d say awkwardly) and Max patted him on the shoulder smiling, but that killed the vibe and changed the topic of our convo imo. You know what I mean? That\u2019s just an example but that\u2019s always his energy! You know, Debbie Downer. It's like a human Dementor\n\n  \nWell. Yeah that was my reasoning. A few days ago, I suggested the idea to Max. I pitched my case by saying we wanted a small wedding anyway and Sebastian is not the most sociable guy, and his energy is not necessarily the energy I want that day, you know? That\u2019s all. Max shut down my suggestion immediately and later he said he wasn\u2019t mad at me or anything but his face when we were having that conversation told me otherwise. Apparently he also told her mother (she was in our place at that moment) because I was getting a weird vibe from her too later that day. I felt judged.   \n**Like I said, I\u2019m not a bridezilla and Sebastian is going to the wedding. It ain\u2019t that deep!

It's pretty clear he suffers from low esteem and depression and you want your fianc\u00e9 to exclude him from one of the most significant days in your fianc\u00e9's life?

He wants him there - Sebastian gets the invite. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s people on your side that Max could do without too. It\u2019s called compromise.\n\nAnd realistically- how much time do you think you\u2019d even spend with Sebastian at your wedding? You\u2019ll be too busy to even really interact a ton which is why you need to get over it. YTA!", "YTA - You feel judged?

All you did was ask. When your fianc\u00e9 said no you accepted that and moved on. I understand not wanting him there if he is in fact a huge downer.

There doesn't seem to be substantial reason to believe he's going to bring down the vibe of the entire wedding. He sounds depressed. It was an insensitive \"suggestion\" and your language surrounding Sebastian makes you sound pretty insensitive in general, ngl.\n\nEdited to add, the comment you brought up as an example wasn't even that bad.

If he refuses, the there's not much you can do about it. If you asked your fiance politely to consider not inviting him since it's a small wedding anyway, I don't think it's a big deal.

He may be at a table where someone brings out a fun side in him or, he finds someone to commiserate.

Sure, you're not obligated to do anything about that, but I can guarantee excluding him from his friends' major life events because he bums you out doesn't do him any favors either. I have an old friend from college whose wife pretty much hated my guts for similar reasons around the time they got married, but he made a point to include me in his life and now we're thick as thieves. When your friends are down that's when you need to pull them closer, not push them away. You could be the reason things turn around for Sebastian, sometimes all it takes is feeling like you matter to someone, you don't have to be his bestie, but don't stand in the way of your husband including him in your lives unless some of his behavior becomes legitimately problematic, being a bummer doesn't qualify, that's just a cry for help.", "NAH.

So NAH but i get your point OP. Some people dont really like the Sebastians of this world and that's ok.\n\nIf he's crying in the corner or something there isn't much you can do other than let your husband and his other friends comfort him, I mean people dont ask to be depressed.
