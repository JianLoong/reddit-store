Max and Sebastian met each other at school and  they kept in touch after years, mostly a texting video calling friend, but he comes to visit us sometimes and we would go to the same parties/events every so often.\n\n  \n**First things first, I\u2019m not a bridezilla**, okay, Max said \u201cNope, he\u2019s coming\u201d and that was it. It was nothing more than a suggestion. The suggestion is the action I\u2019m asking about, I\u2019m not a crazy bride.     \nMy reasoning for my suggestion is because Sebastian is the most Debbie Downer person I\u2019ve ever met.  The definition for that is \u201cA person with an incessant need to bring down the collective mood and general ambience of a group-chill\u201d and he\u2019s exactly that person. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s a sweet guy, and Max cares a lot for him and I know Seb is a great friend too.\n\n  \nThe last time we were together with Sebastian and a couple of friends in a local bar,  we were talking about our future, getting kids, getting wrinkles, grey hair, turning 30, and whatnot. When Max asked Sebastian where he\u2019d see himself at 40, Sebastian said something amongst the lines of ***\u201cHonestly can\u2019t see myself at 40, surprised I made it to 30***\u201d. The group laughed it off (I\u2019d say awkwardly) and Max patted him on the shoulder smiling, but that killed the vibe and changed the topic of our convo imo. You know what I mean? That\u2019s just an example but that\u2019s always his energy! You know, Debbie Downer. It's like a human Dementor\n\n  \nWell. Yeah that was my reasoning. A few days ago, I suggested the idea to Max. I pitched my case by saying we wanted a small wedding anyway and Sebastian is not the most sociable guy, and his energy is not necessarily the energy I want that day, you know? That\u2019s all. Max shut down my suggestion immediately and later he said he wasn\u2019t mad at me or anything but his face when we were having that conversation told me otherwise. Apparently he also told her mother (she was in our place at that moment) because I was getting a weird vibe from her too later that day. I felt judged.   \n**Like I said, I\u2019m not a bridezilla and Sebastian is going to the wedding. It ain\u2019t that deep!

It's pretty clear he suffers from low esteem and depression and you want your fianc\u00e9 to exclude him from one of the most significant days in your fianc\u00e9's life?

He wants him there - Sebastian gets the invite. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s people on your side that Max could do without too. It\u2019s called compromise.\n\nAnd realistically- how much time do you think you\u2019d even spend with Sebastian at your wedding? You\u2019ll be too busy to even really interact a ton which is why you need to get over it. YTA!", "YTA - You feel judged?

I think he should be excluded from social events\", which, newsflash, are the kind of things that push depressed people further into depression / suicide.\n\nYou are a self-proclaimed \"not bridezilla\" (which is doubtful in my mind...), but you certainly are the asshole of this situation.", "NAH OP. All you did was ask. When your fianc\u00e9 said no you accepted that and moved on. I understand not wanting him there if he is in fact a huge downer. There\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting someone who makes their depression a personality trait ESPECIALLY if they refuse to get help.

It all worked out fine.", "NAH\n\nI'm not sure your example is the best one because those are the kinds of comments lots of people make whether in jest or in some seriousness.

There doesn't seem to be substantial reason to believe he's going to bring down the vibe of the entire wedding. He sounds depressed. It was an insensitive \"suggestion\" and your language surrounding Sebastian makes you sound pretty insensitive in general, ngl.\n\nEdited to add, the comment you brought up as an example wasn't even that bad. Life is fucking hard, and talking about it isn't being a \"Debbie downer,\" it's being human. Some people can be a genuine and constant drain, this guy doesn't seem like one of them to me.", "YTA\n\nSounds like he has dark humor or maybe even depression.

Sounds like toxic positivity. Allow your and his friends come as they are.", "NTA.  OP made a suggestion, with reasons to back it up, and then let it go when husband strongly disagreed.

Your husband wants to invite a friend, whose only problem is either a somewhat negative outlook on life, or a really dark sense of humor.  As for your example, topics of conversation change all the time, they usually don\u2019t make it all the way through with everyone sharing their answer.  \n\nOh also.

Honestly, I wouldn't really want someone who is a constant Debbie Downer \u2639\ufe0f at my wedding either, if he's just going to sit there glumly and say things to bring everybody down. He might be depressed, it might be his dark sense of humor or he might just be someone who likes to complain. If he's depressed, then I hope he seeks help. If he refuses, the there's not much you can do about it. If you asked your fiance politely to consider not inviting him since it's a small wedding anyway, I don't think it's a big deal.

Instead of taking it personally, just treat it as a normal disagreement and hopefully you'll remedy the situation.  \nAlso, early congratulations on getting married!", "YTA. Also what you call a Debbie downer sounds like depression.

And the Bridezilla.\n\nWhy is your wedding about Seb's attendance and not the groom?\n\nSeb doesnt reflect on you- he is his own person. Let him be him. He is a sweet guy, concentrate on that. I think a little Zilla is showing its' head- and let me tell you why: because you are worried not about Max at the wedding (his comfort) but instead, how Max reflects on you.\n\nHe does not. He may be at a table where someone brings out a fun side in him or, he finds someone to commiserate.
