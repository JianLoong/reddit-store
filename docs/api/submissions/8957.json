Max and Sebastian met each other at school and  they kept in touch after years, mostly a texting video calling friend, but he comes to visit us sometimes and we would go to the same parties/events every so often.\n\n  \n**First things first, I\u2019m not a bridezilla**, okay, Max said \u201cNope, he\u2019s coming\u201d and that was it. It was nothing more than a suggestion. The suggestion is the action I\u2019m asking about, I\u2019m not a crazy bride.     \nMy reasoning for my suggestion is because Sebastian is the most Debbie Downer person I\u2019ve ever met.  The definition for that is \u201cA person with an incessant need to bring down the collective mood and general ambience of a group-chill\u201d and he\u2019s exactly that person. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s a sweet guy, and Max cares a lot for him and I know Seb is a great friend too.\n\n  \nThe last time we were together with Sebastian and a couple of friends in a local bar,  we were talking about our future, getting kids, getting wrinkles, grey hair, turning 30, and whatnot. When Max asked Sebastian where he\u2019d see himself at 40, Sebastian said something amongst the lines of ***\u201cHonestly can\u2019t see myself at 40, surprised I made it to 30***\u201d. The group laughed it off (I\u2019d say awkwardly) and Max patted him on the shoulder smiling, but that killed the vibe and changed the topic of our convo imo. You know what I mean? That\u2019s just an example but that\u2019s always his energy! You know, Debbie Downer. It's like a human Dementor\n\n  \nWell. Yeah that was my reasoning. A few days ago, I suggested the idea to Max. I pitched my case by saying we wanted a small wedding anyway and Sebastian is not the most sociable guy, and his energy is not necessarily the energy I want that day, you know? That\u2019s all. Max shut down my suggestion immediately and later he said he wasn\u2019t mad at me or anything but his face when we were having that conversation told me otherwise. Apparently he also told her mother (she was in our place at that moment) because I was getting a weird vibe from her too later that day. I felt judged.   \n**Like I said, I\u2019m not a bridezilla and Sebastian is going to the wedding. It ain\u2019t that deep!

It's pretty clear he suffers from low esteem and depression and you want your fianc\u00e9 to exclude him from one of the most significant days in your fianc\u00e9's life?

He wants him there - Sebastian gets the invite. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s people on your side that Max could do without too. It\u2019s called compromise.\n\nAnd realistically- how much time do you think you\u2019d even spend with Sebastian at your wedding? You\u2019ll be too busy to even really interact a ton which is why you need to get over it. YTA!", "YTA - You feel judged?

All you did was ask. When your fianc\u00e9 said no you accepted that and moved on. I understand not wanting him there if he is in fact a huge downer.

There doesn't seem to be substantial reason to believe he's going to bring down the vibe of the entire wedding. He sounds depressed. It was an insensitive \"suggestion\" and your language surrounding Sebastian makes you sound pretty insensitive in general, ngl.\n\nEdited to add, the comment you brought up as an example wasn't even that bad.

If he refuses, the there's not much you can do about it. If you asked your fiance politely to consider not inviting him since it's a small wedding anyway, I don't think it's a big deal.

He may be at a table where someone brings out a fun side in him or, he finds someone to commiserate.

You don't get 100-200 people of two different families together and have everyone be best friends and get along and have the same energy. \n\nSomeone's grandmother is disapproving that the couple lived together before married, someone's uncle is a drunk, someone's friends from college talk too much about their semester abroad, people easily meet 100 new people, and don't need to best friends with all of them. \n\nThis IS bridezilla behavior because you're micromanaging the \"energy\" of the wedding, and worried about the experience your wedding guests will have with interacting with one guest, who isn't inappropriate, or drunk, or racist, or in love with one of you, but just...not your taste in personality.", "Yes, YTA for suggesting it. Your wedding is a big, intense event where you don\u2019t have to hang out with everyone. Sebastian probably won\u2019t want to hang out with you, either. He would be there to support your husband, which is probably important to him, whether or not he is a bummer to be around.", "YTA.\n\nWhat are you going to say, \"We'd invite you but you're too depressing to be around\"?\n\nPlus he'll be with other friends who know him.

The vibe of what you want for your wedding day is more important than having a dear friend who is close enough to go out of his way to visit you guys and clearly has meant a lot to your husband to be. The vibe shouldn\u2019t be more important than a person. YTA. Also that wasn\u2019t him being a Debbie downer. That was him answering a question. Just because he didn\u2019t give some super cheery answer you had doesn\u2019t mean a Debbie downer. That could have just been he doesn\u2019t know. Or maybe he has dealt with some issues and just getting to 30 was the goal. Or maybe he has a dark sense of humor. Just because someone isn\u2019t sunshine and daisies 24/7 doesn\u2019t mean they are less of a person or not worthy of being included in major moments for important people. But than again for AH like you the vibe is more important. YTA", "YTA what you said is like \u201cI\u2019m not a bigot!

And for us the joke would\u2019ve been huh same! Life\u2019s crazy right! And then moved on. He even comes and visits but OP acts like he\u2019s just a toss away friend they can exclude because he made a mild! Dark joke and isn\u2019t a social butterfly.

My husband often says that for some reason he didn\u2019t expect to make it past 25. He can\u2019t explain why he felt that way. This is the kind of joke he would make.
