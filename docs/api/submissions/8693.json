So when I got a delivery invite for froyo, I told him sure, I\u2019d pick it up if he called in the order. Some things you should know: he refuses to a) walk out of a restaurant holding leftovers, & b) call in an order in over the phone. Nobody knows why, that\u2019s just who he is & we accept it. Also, he never pays me back, & then shames me when I ask him to, & it\u2019s not because he can\u2019t afford it, so it\u2019s just easier to not put myself in that position, hence the calling in the order because then he\u2019d have to pay over the phone, & I wouldn\u2019t be out the money. \n\nHe can\u2019t handle calling a froyo chain to say \u201cI\u2019d like this food\u201d gets frustrated & tells me he\u2019ll see if he can do it.

I tell him he has to call the actual froyo place. He gets all shitty, it escalates, I say maybe I shouldn\u2019t come over tonight, & then he gets pissed & says to come for the kids.\n\nI head over there & watch while they eat dinner (another reason I feel I was being used for yogurt, because when they want to hang out with me, they always offer me dinner, but this invite was specifically \u201cnot for dinner,\u201d per my bro. Upon learning there was no froyo, my spoiled niece sits & sulks (throwing the occasional mini fit), for at least 10 minutes. I get her attention, tell her I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s my fault (if my brother had told me that the kids were expecting it, then I would have gone\u2026but he could also have still placed a DoorDash order).\n\nThis was never completely about the time or the money. This is about depression being an asshole & a liar, so when I get \u201cdelivery invites\u201d & it makes me sad that they probably just want me over so I can bring them food & groceries, then it becomes an issue of not letting myself be a doormat anymore. I\u2019ll come over, but I\u2019m not going to run errands for you. After all, would he have been so upset about the froyo if his first thought was that he wanted to spend time with me? Probably not, and it makes me sad.

It\u2019s just a cycle that continues because he refused to talk about anything.

Fuck, it\u2019s one of the main reasons I haven\u2019t told them about the ASD yet (I tested in April 2022 and got the diagnosis a month later).
