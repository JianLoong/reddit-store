This little girl doesn't deserve this and needs someone to step up for her.", "YWNBTA - You need to say something. Perhaps suss out what the arrangements are with the teenagers. It might be that they are too young for the responsibility, rather than actively cruel.

Why are you caring about whether a teenager gets 'into trouble' for neglecting the care of a sick and dying little girl?? \n\nShe's not being fed or changed, is  barely cared for and that's just what you observe from glimpses.

Why? \n\nNTA for telling mum and YTA for even considering that a teenager getting grounded could every be a reason to ignore child abuse.", "YWBTA if you don\u2019t tell the mother. It\u2019s actually very bizarre that you were interfering to the point where you were changing the girl\u2019s diapers and feeding her? You are a candy store employee, not a family member. How on earth would you get into a situation where you\u2019re instructing them to change her diaper and feed her, and they refuse, so you do these tasks? That\u2019s well outside the bounds of a stranger\u2019s conduct and it\u2019s creepy. \n\nYou could harm her and be liable, and it\u2019s also very likely that the family would not want a stranger doing something so intimate. If you were truly concerned for Ava\u2019s well-being you should have called an authority rather than doing these invasive tasks. I\u2019m leaning towards this story being fake but on the off chance it\u2019s not, you\u2019ve acted very inappropriately and you should tell the mother.", ">I\u2019ve been thinking of telling Rose about what we see on Fridays but her older daughter is probably just a kid herself and I\u2019m not sure if I want to get her in trouble.\n\nThe kid is a teen who should  know better and if she doesnt or even i its Parentification  its still not a reason for neglect which is what your seeing here.\n\nSoemething has to be saidAt the very least I would go to your manger and have them approach them.\n\nNTA", "If you think the little one is being neglected - you should tell her mom.

You're an employee of a store the child likes, not a family friend or relative.\n\nThe oldest daughter shouldn't be asked to take care of the younger one if she has lots of additional needs but that doesn't change the fact that she is doing a piss poor job anyway and Ava deserves better.
