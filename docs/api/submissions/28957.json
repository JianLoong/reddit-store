You really think that a person who goes so far out of their way to take such good care of their sick child, isn\u2019t going to care or doesn\u2019t deserve to know when someone\u2019s mistreating said child?! Tell her, now.  Besides I doubt that teenage girl will really get into any serious trouble. She might lose her phone for a week or be grounded for 2 weeks, but more than likely the mom will just stop letting her watch the child. Which is the best situation all around.

'Oh great Ava's stroller is fixed' could be a good way to let mum know Ava didn't have all her normal supplies on Friday and leave it open for her to ask OP more questions if she wants to. If she's asking questions about what Ava was missing, or the steps OP had to take for her comfort, she'll feel more in control and less blindsided if she's completely unaware of what is going on. She's probably going to feel guilty her arrangements aren't working as they should. She can then go home and ask her older child for an explanation in private and make decisions without an audience.", "Yep, this is clearly the mum's fault. You can't just foist young kids on their siblings and expect them to be perfect babysitters.", "Parentification is not baby-sitting one day a week for a couple hours. That's a chore.", "She may not even be her child, she could just be a hired babysitter. Plenty of people hire their friends kids as babysitters.", "You are NTA but you are putting yourself at risk by doing intimate care such as changing Ava. You need to report this to your manager immediately and tell Rose what you have observed. I\u2019m guessing that this teenager is her sister but you don\u2019t know that for sure and this girl is either unprepared for what\u2019s going on, doesn\u2019t know how to care for Ava or is deeply resentful of being asked to do so. Either way you need to let Rose know because Ava can\u2019t. Rose needs to find better childcare- it sounds as if Ava needs full time supervision and safety which isn\u2019t happening here. Also if there are a group of girls then that\u2019s got to be challenging for all of them as well, they clearly don\u2019t know how to care for Ava and frankly it\u2019s not appropriate for them to either. \n\n\nBut seriously- cover your butt and don\u2019t change Ava again. In the nicest way possible, while at work you are a candy store employee not a nanny or babysitter.

That is extremely normal to do as siblings. parentification would be more like if every day the teen had to take care of ava after school and wasnt allowed yo go out because of it", "YWNBTA\n\nBut.\n\nPeople who volunteer with children and youth (where I live) are specifically told to inform CPS of any witnessed abuse, and to *never ever directly confront one of the suspects about it*.\n\nAnd that is because perpetrators of abuse are extremely unlikely to cease the abuse afterwards. In fact, they're more likely to tell you some placating lie, and to then make sure you'll never catch evidence to the contrary. And often take it out on the kids in the meantime.\n\nOther commenters have pointed out why it seems likely that there is some parental neglect going on.\n\nNo matter what you end up doing, I *would* advise you to document any neglect you witnessed in written form, with corrobating statements from your coworkers. It's always better to have this kind of thing, just in case.", "NTA Tell Rose", "yes", "OP, I would handle it by bringing it up casually to the mom. \"Oh my gosh, we love seeing Ava when your older daughter brings her in. Ava just wants to stay here all day! I know, for whatever reason, she doesn't seem to be getting to eat or getting her diaper changed with her sister, so I always buy a diaper so she doesn't have to sit in a dirty one all day, and I try to keep snacks on hand. I don't mind at all! I just love seeing her so much! And I'm sure she's just more tired those days, since she has to walk the whole time.\" Or, whatever.

You want to make sure Rose has all the information in a non-judgmental way. Maybe say \u201cwe\u2019ve been keeping some diapers here\u201d instead of \u201cbuy\u201d if you feel and want to emphasize that you\u2019re happy to help out and aren\u2019t mentioning it so she\u2019ll pay you back.

That Venn diagram is likely a circle.\n\nPlease fill in Rose ASAP. If Ava is terminal (or even if not), her condition is likely even more fragile than it looks.

I think the way OP approaches the Mom needs to be very careful - my phrasing was meant to show care for the child, that she\u2019s always welcome and no judgement. Mom will get the message. But Mom may also have no other options. If OP goes in saying the Friday carer is terrible, Mom may feel attacked.", "It is insufficient to be passive aggressive when a child is being left in soiled diapers.

But it's not. The most important thing is that Ava ends up better cared for, not that OP has a clear conscience.", "It's baby-sitting one day a week. Don't be so dramatic.", "Right, so why be so vague when discussing the welfare of a terminally ill child? Your suggestion sacrifices critical information in favor of insulating feelings, when the priority should be making sure Rose has the full story - something she\u2019s unlikely to get from the teenage daughter. What if she doesn\u2019t even pick up on the stroller comment, or there really was an issue with the stroller one day so she sees no reason to mention it?"]}
