It\u2019s actually very bizarre that you were interfering to the point where you were changing the girl\u2019s diapers and feeding her? You are a candy store employee, not a family member. How on earth would you get into a situation where you\u2019re instructing them to change her diaper and feed her, and they refuse, so you do these tasks? That\u2019s well outside the bounds of a stranger\u2019s conduct and it\u2019s creepy. \n\nYou could harm her and be liable, and it\u2019s also very likely that the family would not want a stranger doing something so intimate.

You're an employee of a store the child likes, not a family friend or relative.\n\nThe oldest daughter shouldn't be asked to take care of the younger one if she has lots of additional needs but that doesn't change the fact that she is doing a piss poor job anyway and Ava deserves better.

And to be fair, the older sibling is a teenager probably being forced (in her mind) to care for a sick child. We can all think that's what siblings do but we don't know this family dynamic. \n\nWe also don't know if something terrible happened. \n\nEither way, Ava is not being taken care of, it seems.

Please talk to Rose. Ava is being mistreated.", "NTA TELL HER, YTA IF DONT. \n\nI don\u2019t see how you can excuse the older kids behavior, it doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s just a kid herself. She knows better than to be treated a child with such neglect, especially a child who fucking terminal. Her mother deserves to know. You really think that a person who goes so far out of their way to take such good care of their sick child, isn\u2019t going to care or doesn\u2019t deserve to know when someone\u2019s mistreating said child?! Tell her, now.  Besides I doubt that teenage girl will really get into any serious trouble. She might lose her phone for a week or be grounded for 2 weeks, but more than likely the mom will just stop letting her watch the child. Which is the best situation all around.

Mom, I hope, doesn\u2019t know and might think this is sibling bonding time or that it\u2019s important social interaction, but maybe older sister feels burdened and resentful. It shows in her level of care that it isn\u2019t something she\u2019s interested in, so hopefully parent(s) can find a proper caregiver and sister can resume a sibling role.", "Parentification isn\u2019t caring for a sibling one day a week though; it is an assigned chore that should be done well. However, if the sibling is trying to get out of it at the expense of the little one, they need to find alternatives for caregiving or an after school program.", "You yourself are ignoring child abuse.

What illness does she have and what affect does sugar have on it?", "It needs to be something non-judgmental, so the mother doesn't feel like she's being accused of something. 'Oh great Ava's stroller is fixed' could be a good way to let mum know Ava didn't have all her normal supplies on Friday and leave it open for her to ask OP more questions if she wants to. If she's asking questions about what Ava was missing, or the steps OP had to take for her comfort, she'll feel more in control and less blindsided if she's completely unaware of what is going on. She's probably going to feel guilty her arrangements aren't working as they should. She can then go home and ask her older child for an explanation in private and make decisions without an audience.", "Yep, this is clearly the mum's fault. You can't just foist young kids on their siblings and expect them to be perfect babysitters.", "Parentification is not baby-sitting one day a week for a couple hours. That's a chore.", "She may not even be her child, she could just be a hired babysitter. Plenty of people hire their friends kids as babysitters."]}
