So I asked her if she could just watch down stairs in the living room because it wasn't something that I was comfortable with. She turned it off and said that she apologized and that she would just watch it when I am at work/not home.

Basically, nobody wants to think they\u2019re a bad person, so we refuse to acknowledge our own biases.\n\n\nThe way you phrased everything, it\u2019s clear you have bigoted beliefs and attitudes about Black people.
