You are both grieving in different ways and coping with the loss of your mother. It sounds like your sister is suffering from depression and anxiety, and she may need professional help. Maybe you can try to reach out to her with compassion and empathy, and let her know that you love her and miss her. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NAH. It sounds like you're really missing the interactions with your sister but we all handle grief in different ways. Some people need to be alone to deal with it. In my own experiences, I've stayed by myself for a month after a loss in my family and I still broke down crying the next time I was around family. We all move at our own pace so just keep that in mind, you two will be fine. Just need some patience.", "NAH. Like others have said everyone processes grief differently. However, I do think it was unfair of you to say she puts the dog above the rest of her family and that her priorities are messed up because I think it's more about her grief than the dog, and she is clearly struggling. This probably isn't what she wanted to hear from her sister. But I can see it's a difficult time and situation for you both.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is grieving, and unfortunately, she's letting her grief take over her life.  It may seem like she's being an AH but grief twists you in all kinds of effed up ways.  \n\nHer husband blaming it on you is BS.  Her mental instability is due to grief, and if she's not seeking therapy - and he's not insisting she seek therapy - nothing will improve.\n\nI know you're now dealing with two losses - your mom AND your sister - and I can't imagine how difficult this must be.  Unfortunately, you have to just leave her be and let her work through it her way.  it will just keep hurting you if you keep trying and she keeps rejecting.\n\nHang in there.  Tomorrow is the 3 year anniversary of my dad's passing, and it's so hard.", "INFO, you mention she doesn't want to leave the house, how many times did you visit your sister after your mother's passing?", ">Are we not supposed to talk about it?\n\nYes. Bringing this up with your sister was a good step because it means you're on the path of understanding. It's true, everyone grieves in different ways, but you're not an AH just for bringing it up - your feelings *were* hurt and you wanted to do something about it.\n\n>I told her that her priorities were messed up.\n\nI think this is where it went wrong. You can't see inside your sister's brain so you don't know how she's coping. This is an accusatory statement unlike your other 'I feel' comments, and probably why she got mad.\n\n>bc of the \u2018horrible\u2019 things I said to my sister, she is mentally unstable and it\u2019s all my fault.\n\nI'm going to assume you told the truth in this post and never said anything 'horrible'. This is an overreaction from your sister, and, quite frankly, a mean one. Maybe she's lashing out due to grief, maybe she misunderstood what you said, maybe she's just mean. It's not clear to me.\n\n>three months later and I have tried to extend an olive branch multiple times\n\nIf she did lash out, three months is a long time to stay in the heat of the moment. And if she misunderstood you, your reaching out should have cleared that. So unless you were more spiteful than this post conveys, your sister seems to be unkind here.\n\nI'm going with NAH, because while I do think your sister's behaviour was harsh, we don't know why she did it so I'm hesitant to call a grieving woman an AH. Your accusatory comment was also unreasonable but once again, you're grieving; it's not fair to call you an AH for that (especially as you've tried to resolve the matter).\n\nBut honestly. It doesn't even matter who's right or wrong in this situation, because you can't undo it. AH or not, reaching out is the only option here, and that's what you've done. The ball is in your sister's court. I really do hope she responds soon and you guys can talk it out in an empathic manner. In the meantime, best of wishes for the lives of both of you.", "NAH (or maybe E S H? Depends on how much leniency we are giving for how crazy grief makes you). Consider for a moment: your sister is not coping. \n\nShe got this dog to feel useful, but probably also to feel like she's still caring for your mother. You had your baby to focus on, and clearly you have a better connection to the outside world. Your sister went inwards. She's grieving the way she feels she needs to, even if it doesn't seem to be healthy. \n\nYou want your sister to support you and participate in your family in it's new shape. Your sister wants to stay home and take care of her dog, *her* new family member. You criticised her new family, told her she needed to focus on *your* new family, told her she was messed up for not feeling how you did. She responded by making it clear that you're right, she doesn't agree with your priorities and completely disengaging. You didn't make her \"mentally unstable\", but you definitely sent her into a spiral.\n\nGive it time. Let up on her. You don't want her to miss your baby as a baby, but you can't make her interact with your baby either. It wasn't right that she ignored you when you were in danger, but then again maybe the concept of losing you is something she couldn't face either.", "NAH ... Everybody grieves differently, sorry for your loss.", "NTA. It was correct, what you said. But it seems that your sisterhas some deep psychological problems because of the death of your mother. She should seek help. Maybe if you are on good terms with your BIL ask him, if she is getting the help she needs.", "ESH\n\nEveryone grieves differently and for you to basically tell her she can\u2019t grieve her own way because she needed to be there for you is pretty fucked up.\n\nBut, she should have reached out after you gave birth.\n\nYou sound like you\u2019re putting yourselves and your own needs first and only really thinking about your own grief and not anyone else\u2019s but then getting upset when she does the same.\n\nFor you, the whole family being together was part of your grieving process. For your sister, being alone and caring for her dog was her grieving process. Why should she have had to stop her own grieving process to enable yours? She was doing what was best for her and you shamed her for it because it didn\u2019t benefit you. It was the first Mother\u2019s Day without her mom, not just yours. She didn\u2019t want to be around a bunch of people, she wanted to stay home with her dog. Why do you feel like you can dictate how she grieves and what she does?", "NTA, trauma impacts everyone differently. Without more information, it is hard to tell, but given the post, it seems that, through an impossible time in their lives, one sister is living while the other is closing off and the dog is an excuse. Family who refuses to be familiar doesn't need to be family but in this case, the justification is valid, grief is difficult to judge.", "NTA to reach out, but leave it.  She needs to grieve in her own way, and nothing you say or do will change that fact.  Focus on your new family.  NAH", "YTA. Everyone has their own way of grieving and even though you knew your sister was holed up you tried to engage with her in ways that she couldn't respond to. I know you want to help. But you need to help her in a way she wants to be helped. \n\nHow about instead of the grill and chill you went to her house and spent time with her there? Or get your husband to bring a bag or groceries and cook at her house for everyone including your dad. \n\nYou are ofcourse going through your own stuff but I dont think you get to take the high road because you tried in ways that work for you or because you were pregnant or almost died or not. This is isn't about you alone. Whether you drown in 100ft of water or 10 ft of water, you are still drowning.\n\nI lost my dad 14 years ago and we are three siblings. I can confirm that you that even after all these years, how we deal with it is every different. Hang in there and have some empathy. If your bond was as strong as you stated you can always apologize, make amends and meet her where she is.", "Gently, YTA.  This isn\u2019t all about you, but you are making it all about your grief and your baby, with seemingly very little regard for her grief and her experiences.  You want her to show up for you and accept what you have to give on entirely your own terms, but maybe she handles grief differently from you and all the ways you believe you were \u201cshowing up\u201d for her weren\u2019t actually the kid of \u201cshowing up\u201d she wanted or needed.  And then after you verbally attacked her, you\u2019re actually surprised she isn\u2019t showing up for more?", "Thank you for all of the perspectives!

But in your grief, you didn't get to criticize her for how she was trying to cope. She didn't need your hurt feelings added to her own grief, you use a friend to vent about that shit. You only think about yourself and your grief and your baby. She's struggling too, and if you can't figure out a way to be there for her the way she needs, then don't lash out to her with your hurt feelings. You created this rift and you deserve it imo", "YTA.

Going to hospital, sitting with me after operation, dealing with an almost bleed out hurt him badly as not good memories.

Taking care of a sick dog and making them comfortable may be therapeutic for your sister, maybe taking care of the dog alleviates some guilt of not being able to save your mother. You want your sister there withy ou for this big life-changing thing, which is understandable. It's also understandable to be hurt that you feel she is putting a dog over your family - however, welcoming a new chapter/new life into the family can be really hard to do when youre grieving. It may be triggering for her to think about meeting your child when your mom passed so recently and won't get to be there to meet them also. Hopefully, through time and therapy you can both understand each other and your own grief and become closer again.", "NAH you're both in mourning and she's locking away with her pain. make sure your BIL knows how you feel and that when she's ready to come out, you'll still be there and still waiting.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "This is a great idea", "We told her to bring him!", "Nobody is defending the selfish sister as aggressively as you.", "\"As if by some form of grief during this process my sister adopted a very sick five year old who has cancer.\"\n\nDOG. You really need to edit DOG into that sentence.", "Have you invited the dog to come with her? It could be a starting place.", "Yta.", "Yta", "I'm going to go with NAH rather than mild YTA....but it sounds like you sister is going through a hard time and wants to be left alone, and you keep ignoring those boundries she is setting up.\n\nI think you should consider leaving her alone to work this out on her own, because right now you are not someone she wants to deal with.", "NTA. Some people use grief as an excuse to indulge in their worst narcissistic tendencies. Was your sister always The Main Character in your family life?", "I'm so sorry for the loss of your mom and congratulations on the birth of your son. Grief does strange things to people. You were too harsh on your sister. Just saying you missed her and hoped to see her soon was enough. She isn't able to socialize right now. And she is pouring her grief and sadness into taking care of this dying dog. She couldn't help your mom, but at least she can help him. Just back off and she'll come back when she's ready. Her husband is blaming you because he has to blame someone. But obviously, she was struggling mentally long before you said anything. Your son is only a few months old. She hasn't missed anything that won't happen again. Stop taking it personally and just try to enjoy the fact that you and your son are healthy.\n\nNAH", "NTA - people grieve differently. Her husband is not helping in the slightest and needs to back off. Her mental instability is not due to you, it's more likely due to her not being able to process her grief well. \n\nKeep reaching out the olive branch and keep the lines of communication open. There really is nothing more you can do other than be ready to rebuild the relationship, once she's in a place where grief doesn't control her life.", "NTA, but it sounds like your sister and probably family need some counseling in one form or another. The dog seems to be her coping mechanism for dealing with grief. We all do this in one way or another.", "NTA but this isn't about a dog.\n\nShe is not processing her grief over your mother.  That is nothing to do with either the dog or what you said to her. Her husband is an asshole.", "NTA at all. You had every right to voice how you were feeling. She is NOT the only one grieving here. Just like she feels she needs this dog, you and your family needed HER and she was nowhere to be found. You are correct, she is prioritizing a dog that she could bring with her or make comfortable while she is gone instead of those she claims to care about. Whether this is a weird way of grieving or not, you are allowed to have feelings and voice them. For her husband to blame you and only you for her bad state of mental health is insanely terrible because it seems she is doing nothing to further help herself (I hope I am wrong in this). I am so sorry you're going through this, I cannot imagine how hard all of this is and on top of that having to argue with family. I am glad you and your son made it out alive and healthy. I hope you two find peace and come back together!", "Done! Oops that was a big mistake", "Yes every single time", "Thank you very much for this. \nThe thing that bothers me about OP's tone is that it is ALL about HER.\nEven her fear about not being close to her sister is described as being one of the things SHE promised their mother would not happen.\nThey are both grieving the loss of their mother. Everyone does it differently and OP doesn't see the sister's way as valid.\nI won't say she is an AH but that is asshole behaviour.", "That was my only thought. Could everyone go to her house? Is that an option?", "Let the sister grieve alone. OP is still alive. Why would you give your sister something to think about while she's grieving. Why would you bother someone who wants to grieve alone.\n\nThe fact that she's still alive and told the sister that she almost died while the sister is grieving/sad/depress, obviously wants attention. \n\nIf I want to leave in peace, and my family bothers me and wants to always have it their way, then f*ck it. Forget that you're my sister. Not everything is about you.", "Oh the irony\u2026", "OP you have a lovely little bubba you worked so hard to grow to focus on, put your attention there. Sis will either come to you when she's ready for help or she won't, but you can't spend such an important moment in your life hung up on her. This time goes by so so fast. One of the hardest things to realise is other people's lives don't stop because of your grief, everyone needs to find their own way through. Make the most of spending these early weeks with your hubby and dad, he needs you too. NTA", "The AH is your Bil for blaming you for your sister's mental health struggles. She needs serious help. He is her husband and I hope at some point he can talk her into help.  She is trying to save the dog and care take for the dog like she did for her mother. It is not a healthy coping technique. Simply tell her you love and miss her. You are sorry she is struggling. Then leave it. Take care of yourself, the new baby and support your dad. That is all you can do. May you all find a measure of peace.", "not everything, but some things are, for example the fact she almost died in childbirth and her sister can't even be bothered to pick up the phone or send a text to let her know she's glad she isn't dead.. Yea that is about her. Funny how expecting your sibling to at the very least reach out when you almost died and were previously super close is just entitled and selfish apparently LOL. Believe it or not, her sister can be both depressed and a flaming AH", "Yeah, I am so lost as to what is happening with her. Perhaps she needs to be alone? Her husband is a major TA for talking to you like that. WTF?", "Now imagine the sister  who is SO sad and grieving *almost died* while grieving so hard, *desperately* wanted her sister to help her cope, and OP just selfishly ghosted her.\n\nWould that be bad?  In that situation, don't you think OP should suck it up and visit her sister?", "A friendship can only work if both parties are interested in it.  You're NTAH, you've done your work to patch things up and your sister refuses.", "NAH sounds like you are grieving in different ways. It can be hard to accept but we all need different things when we face loss. You can share how you feel but also hear how she feels", "NTA. She's not mentally unstable because of what you said to her. BIL is way out of line for saying that. Sounds like he's using you as a scapegoat. I think all you say to her at this point is \"When you're ready to talk, I am ready to listen.\"", "This needs to be high. Wish I could give this an award.", "My mother has been dead for some time. This past May was the 28th Mothers day without Mom.  One of my sisters shuts down on that day. She refused Todo anything, refuses to go to church, refuses visits from family. Her husband and adult kids celebrate with her on the Saturday before Mothers day. She simply can't deal with that day without Mom. This is how she makes it through that day without mentally and emotionally falling apart. My other siblings and I put flowers on her grave after church. OP needs to realize that her sister is dealing with her grief the best way she knows how and so OP needs to back off. I almost died as well. Life flighted top regional trauma hospital. I was in a coma. Family told to come say goodbye because people with my injuries and subsequent illness, don't make it. My heart stopped for 6.5 minutes and the last time they shocked my heart was going to be the last time they shocked my heart, regardless. It would either work, or signal my time of death. Did my siblings visit me? Most of them did. One of my younger brothers couldn't make himself see me. He was too scared. Then our Dad died while I was still in ICU. That curbed the visits because they were dealing with grief, kids, grandkids and life. Coming 2.5 be hours to see me only to turn around and drive back home was too much! I was in the hospital for 4 months. Know what I DIDN'T do??? Throw my almost death in their face and whine that they weren't there for me. That would be some self centered BS. OPs husband and father are there, oooing and aaahing over that baby and OP. Why must her sister also make her the center of the universe. OP needs to grow up and realize that her life, while important to others, is NOT more important than their own life and physical and mental wellbeing. The only universe OP is the center of, is her own. No one else needs to prove they love her by ignoring their own needs and setting themselves on fire to make OPs life warm and spotlighted.", "So we're equating completely being upset that a sibling completely ignoring the other sibling almost dying in the hospital and not even reaching out once to being selfish? OP literally visited her sister at her own home because she couldn't leave to support her through her grief and dog situation. Expecting an OUNCE OF RECIPROCITY DOES NOT MEAN SHE IS SELFISH. Healthy relationships are not one sided. She is not the only one grieving despite her acting like she is. Everyone grieves in their own way but OP sharing her feelings is completely normal. Her sisters reaction and her husband's baseless accusations are not. Her \"mental instab\" is her own problem and responsibility to deal with. No one else's.", "Dear lord...please stop saying the words \"almost died,\"  She didn't die.  She's not trying to understand the impact of the loss had on other people. When a depressed person says they can't, they really can't. Physically, emotionally, any of it.  She's been through a lot, but her own actions are pushing her sister away.", "OP visited her sister very frequently before this, like every weekend I believe she said. She's been supportive even through her own grief and being pregnant. Her sister seems very selfish.", "NAH. Everyone grieves differently, and I think space is needed on all sides here. \n\nI have to say though, this comment section is wild. Alot of you should consider yourselves lucky that you've never been in a deep depression, which OP's sister is clearly in. When you are that deep, you just don't want to here it. You don't want to be around it. You shut yourself down and you shut yourself in and you physically, emotionally and mentally don't have the energy to deal. \n\nOP's sister is not a monster. She's heavily depressed. You think she doesn't care that her sister almost died? I promise you she cares a great deal.\n\nOP I'm so sorry for your loss of your mother. And also congratulations on the birth of your child! Keep trying to be there for your sister, but have patience. I wish you all peace and comfort and I hope your sister finds her way back soon.", "She is deeply grieving and needs space. She can not handle how she making you feel at this time. Just send her love and support messages to let her know you care. Give her some space at this time.", "NAH although you both have been pretty harsh on eachother. Your sister has a different way of grieving than you do. I think you\u2019re handling your grief a little better, because you were also blessed with your baby\u2019s birth (despite the traumatic delivery ) around the same time. Not saying that made it any easier for you btw! I think you should let your sister take some time and space to herself, before reaching out again. I do think it might be a good idea to reach out to your sister\u2019s husband to help mend your relationship with her. I think what he said to you was very unfair, but he likely lashed out, due to him being so worried about her. Have a talk with him explaining your side of things and just convey to him how much you miss her and believe you\u2019ll need eachother\u2019s support. Maybe , he\u2019ll encourage your sister to atleast come see your baby soon. I really hope you and your sister work things out!", "As a person who had to bury a parent, and never received the opportunity to grieve, it does not excuse the sister's actions. \n\nTherapy is much needed for the sister to process her grief, as it is for the OP, though she may need it to come to terms with her sister's actions.\n\nOP nearly died. She needs support at this time. Not knowing the previous dynamics, it would still behoove the sister to be there for her sibling, who is reaching out for help and support. \n\nIt does not take much for a kind word.", "ESH. Your sister's behaviour is bizarre. Stop reaching out to a person who is not acknowledging your efforts, it is literally harassment. She is a mess and you are not the person to help, so let her be..She is an adult, with a husband who has told you explicitly to back off, and can sort this out herself. I'm sorry for your loss of your mother, but the promise she expected from you isn't appropriate, parents do not own their children's relationships.", "Neither of you are AH\u2019s. It sounds like you\u2019re both just lost trying to process WTF just happened\u2026 Grief is so weird and the fog that comes with it is, too. \n\nMy younger sister and I lost our dad to COVID in 2020 eight days before my daughter\u2019s first birthday. We both had kids\u2014my sister had 7 year old twin boys and a baby diagnosed with profound hearing loss at the time. My daughter was born premature and had a four week NICU stay. The world was in a state of chaos (as you all know) and we had to find a way to grieve. We had to find a way to get shit done. There is no way I would have made it through my dad\u2019s passing without the support of my sister. You\u2019re both processing grief and trauma but in different ways. Of course you\u2019re exhausted, physically, mentally, probably in every way imaginable. Becoming a new parent is hard, and so much harder without a support system, like a mom or sister. Keep reaching out. Keep calling. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you lost your mom. It\u2019s so hard losing a parent and so surreal having a baby after. I wish you well.", "NAH\n\nYou grieve in your way. She grieves in hers.\n\nShe wasn't forcing her way of grieving on you. She was literally staying home.\n\nYou were trying to force your method of grieving on her --- which is to be with family.", "NAH but don\u2019t forget her grief is different to yours. Maybe you\u2019re exacerbating her grief. Also to accuse her of deliberately choosing a dying dog to avoid you is patently unfair. Maybe her way of grieving and coping is to give a loving home to this dog and maybe it helps her feel useful to process her grief at home (bc she doesn\u2019t feel ready to be out in the world putting on a happy face) and being forced to discuss grief your way.\n\nYou didn\u2019t just express how you felt to your sister so much as foisted it in her when she was not ready for it and you want her to be there for you in a way she cannot and doesn\u2019t ant to because you keep forcing her.\n\nThat said you\u2019re not an AH either, your grief is important too but you need to back off from her bc she needs space. You have a baby, your husband and likely friends and a therapist to work through yours your way\n Let her work through hers her way.", "You need to be clear with her about how you are in charge of her life. She's not allowed this much time on her own because you care so much about her. \n\nWhat is wrong with you? Let her be.  \n\nI missed my dog's final moments and that half hour burned in my mind for over a year. Knew she was fading, spent the last 24 hours with her ... you know what? F U, you don't get that story because you don't care. You're angry that she is caring for something other than you, which is beyond selfish. \n\nMaybe next sister, approach her with ideas or offers of what you could do for her, not demands about what she must do for you."]}
