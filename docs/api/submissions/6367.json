There's just one thing, she keeps some of her friends' food supplies in our room since theirs is cramped and there's no space.\n\nSo, her two friends have been going in and out of our room frequently. At first, they would always knock before going in and say hi. But over time, I told them it's fine if they don't knock and they're welcome to go in anytime.\n\nTwo weeks ago though, this girl, Zee, moved in with them and I don't like her one bit. She didn't really do anything outrageously wrong but the way she feels entitled to just barge into the room when we're practically strangers and not even talk to me got on my nerves. Plus, she woke me up several times with how violently she opens the door.\n\nSo I told Lila that when I initially agreed to her friends coming in, I wasn't expecting such a big number and that the way the door is being opened would jolt me awake. She was good about it and said she'll ask them to knock from now on.\n\nZee only knocked for two days before she suddenly barged in again yesterday, searched around for what she needed, then walked out without so much as looking at me. So, I got up and locked the door. When zee came later, she was forced to knock and I only opened the door to a slit and told her I'm sorry Lila isn't in the room. \n\nShe said she just wanted to grab something but I told her I'm sorry the only reason I've been letting them go in is because of Lila on the condition that they knock. But since she wouldn't she would have to go through Lila from now on.\n\nShe got mad and said she's not here to see my \"pretty\" face but because she was hungry and that the room is not just mine. I didn't want to debate this with her so I closed the door and locked it again.\n\nWhen Lila came back I thought she'd be on my side but she actually told me I should have talked to her first and not do this directly to her friend. She said Zee wasn't required to greet me but that she'll talk to her again about the knocking. I told her she wasn't hearing me, that Zee is no longer welcome with or without knocking unless she's there. She said I was being unreasonable and we'll talk again. \n\nWell we haven't since then and none of her friends came by again.

I've been with three roommates so far and I always had this problem with them.\n\nAlso, I feel absolutely safe with her.

They will mediate a conversation. Though I only see 3 outcomes that this can come to:\n\n1. They must move their stuff out of your room. It's not fair to you to have to deal with all that to begin with. In Residence Life, if they have so much stuff that they don't have room for basic necessities, they need to get rid of some things. I had to my first year. Also, all forms are basically the same shape. You all have the same amount of space/storage per person. \n\n2. Locked Door Policy. Everyone must knock from now on and someone must be there to answer the door.\n\n3. Now I cannot stress this enough: Do. Not. Move. Out. It is your space. You are entitled to a safe and secure environment. In escalation, management will move your roommate out if you feel unsafe. Only move out (into a single) if you have the funds to do so, or have a trustworthy friend that has an extra space available in their room. \n\nSome entitled students who are fresh outa highschool do not know how to act in community living environments. They think it is just like their house and they can go into whatever room they want. That is how Zee is acting. \n\nTo reiterate: talk with your RA/Proctor.
