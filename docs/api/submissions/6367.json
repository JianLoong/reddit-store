There's just one thing, she keeps some of her friends' food supplies in our room since theirs is cramped and there's no space.\n\nSo, her two friends have been going in and out of our room frequently. At first, they would always knock before going in and say hi. But over time, I told them it's fine if they don't knock and they're welcome to go in anytime.\n\nTwo weeks ago though, this girl, Zee, moved in with them and I don't like her one bit. She didn't really do anything outrageously wrong but the way she feels entitled to just barge into the room when we're practically strangers and not even talk to me got on my nerves. Plus, she woke me up several times with how violently she opens the door.\n\nSo I told Lila that when I initially agreed to her friends coming in, I wasn't expecting such a big number and that the way the door is being opened would jolt me awake. She was good about it and said she'll ask them to knock from now on.\n\nZee only knocked for two days before she suddenly barged in again yesterday, searched around for what she needed, then walked out without so much as looking at me. So, I got up and locked the door. When zee came later, she was forced to knock and I only opened the door to a slit and told her I'm sorry Lila isn't in the room. \n\nShe said she just wanted to grab something but I told her I'm sorry the only reason I've been letting them go in is because of Lila on the condition that they knock. But since she wouldn't she would have to go through Lila from now on.\n\nShe got mad and said she's not here to see my \"pretty\" face but because she was hungry and that the room is not just mine. I didn't want to debate this with her so I closed the door and locked it again.\n\nWhen Lila came back I thought she'd be on my side but she actually told me I should have talked to her first and not do this directly to her friend. She said Zee wasn't required to greet me but that she'll talk to her again about the knocking. I told her she wasn't hearing me, that Zee is no longer welcome with or without knocking unless she's there. She said I was being unreasonable and we'll talk again. \n\nWell we haven't since then and none of her friends came by again.

I'm not sure why 'theirs is cramped' is your problem. Are these campus spaces not simply cookie cutter shape where its all pretty much the same space amount. Something doesn't add up.\n\nIf I were you I'd apply to transfer to a different room (if possible) because this room mate has made your life impossible now.

Your place is not a storage unit.\nIt's great to have a good roommate, but the way your room turned into their storage and with people constantly going back and forth the place basically became unlivable.

You two either compromise and set boundaries or this arrangement is dropped altogether", "NTA Since room is shared you have to be mindful of your roommate. But then 3 other people to keep coming by is too much and you basically don't have any privacy.

If they need those items so frequently it would be better for them to store it on their own.", "The strangest part is how OP says Lila is a dream room mate.\n\nThis is literally the worst thing a room mate can do do their sharer: walk all over their privacy by wearing down the boundaries this way. I can't help but think that Lila has been 'awesome' because OP has just been so lenient. It's easy to be 'nice' when you're getting everything you want from someone without question.", "They belong to a community that's tightly knit together and constantly have people over.

Their room always looked crowded whenever I visited.", "Ok boomer", "Her other friends are really respectful about it.

It needs to stop.", "If they're going to alienate me over something like this, I don't think I could count on them anyway, including my roommate.", "Nah. The alienation would be a natural response to singling someone in the group out. You might think that you have cause to dislike 1 member within the group, but from their point of view you singled their friend out and refused to make a minor accommodation.\n\nYou would have been better off not opening the door and telling all of them that they needed to knock. This is what you should have done in the first place thinking about it. It is harder to create boundaries after people have grown accustomed to certain liberties. And just from a security point of view, you don't want to raise the expectation that non-residents can come and go as they please.", "NTA and your roommate is opening you up to a law suit if anything is stolen/tampered with since your sometimes sleeping and she's having randos come in while she's not there.

You need to tell Lila this arrangement ends or you go to the RA.", "NTA unless you Both agree to let someone in, then they do Not get let in.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to let your roommates friends enter the room when she's not there.", "Some people bring everything but the kitchen sink, especially in the first year of college; my daughter's first roomie was like that. The situation ended with her getting a different roommate, as the other woman felt that my daughter's clear spaces were free to be used and wouldn't take No for an answer.", "Yeah so it's a life lesson in real estate I guess. LOL.\n\nI guess lone children or siblings where they never had to share a room might find it harder to understand that there's a line.", "I know my post made her out to be bad, but she was a good roommate until this happened. If she wanted to borrow something, she'd always ask me. And my god, if she borrowed let's say my hairdryer once, she would not just go ahead and take it twice, no, she'd ask every single time.\n\nDo you know how precious this kind of behavior is? I've been with three roommates so far and I always had this problem with them.\n\nAlso, I feel absolutely safe with her. I know she'd never take anything nor touch my bed or belongings without permission. Also, she gives little things back she borrows like the toilet paper roll when she gets paid when I have already forgotten about them.\n\nIf it was someone else I'll bet you they won't give it back until I've had to ask for it. This is why I was cool with the storing thing or her friends coming in and out. You treat me good, I treat you good.", "Probably because Lila is letting OP walk all over her too. Note that last line in the OP, which tells up that setting the boundary ONCE already produced the desired result.", "Gee wonder why Zee had a problem and moved out? Maybe because it\u2019s Zee\u2019s world and we\u2019re all living in it.", "I think its a mistake to let people store their stuff on an ongoing basis in your room. That's where the boundary is blurred. Your room is not storage for other people to use.", "I am reconsidering it actually. It was definitely a mistake. Even if I agreed it should have been for them to get what they needed once a day when Lila's there like in the mornings before class or something. Anyway I definitely didn't think it through.\n\nThank you", "I told Lila they all have to knock, not just Zee. She was singled out because she violated the condition after barely following it for two days. Why would I stop the other two when they haven't done anything wrong?"]}
