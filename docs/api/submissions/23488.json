I got pregnant at 14, with my daughter, and my mother disowned me but we recently got in contact. While I know getting pregnant so young wasn\u2019t the best idea, it was definitely the best decision as my mum was an absolute monster growing up and it lead to her getting out of my life as soon as possible, without me feeling guilty; The names she hurled, having a parent who is adamant they are always right and just making my life that little bit more miserable, also as soon as I started getting older, she became health obsessed and would out much smaller amount of food on my plate so I didn\u2019t end up being \u201cfatter\u201d and snacks were removed from the house and leftovers were very much given to our pet dog, who would literally get more food than me and my brother combined.\n\nWe started speaking again as I believed she\u2019d change and so me, my husband Brad, our daughters and son, went over for Sunday lunch, and everything was fine. The roast dinner was like it was when I was a young child and I truly believed she\u2019d left her time as a unhealthy eating habits behind, but half way through the meal, she stopped us, started taking our plates away, and when my husband asked why, she said:\n\n\u201cI purposely gave you more food than usual for leftovers dog, Anna knows I wouldn\u2019t feed her or the kiddies this much in case they became little fatties, but I probably should have gave little Delilah a little less as she getting on the tubby side\u201d -my child is a perfectly healthy weight-\n\nAs she says all this, I feel like the 12 year old little girl who\u2019s crying because her mums digging at her weight, being made to feel crappy about herself because the woman who\u2019s supposed to love me is micromanaging everything I eat and calling me vicious names, and I\u2019d never allow her to make any of my children feel like that, so I bolt up in rage, before  shouting: \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you even dare take any food off of their plate to give to that dog! If you even try  putting any mental harm on my kids, I\u2019ll make fucking sure you never see us again!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s kind of a silence between the pair of us before an argument ensues, where she claims she\u2019s \u201conly got my best interest at heart\u201d and that \u201cBrad won\u2019t love me anymore if I continue being a fatty\u201d and that I should have lost the baby fat and it wouldn\u2019t have happened if I\u2019d stayed in contact with her. She called me an asshole and a silly whale, before I left with my family, and other family members are saying that while I was right not to let her do that to my kids, I was an asshole for threatening to take her grandchildren away from her, when she\u2019s only just got them back, and now I\u2019m just confused and starting to consider that I may be one for emotional blackmail.", "created_utc": 1690731182, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15dog3c/aita_for_telling_my_mum_that_if_she_touched_the/", "score": 2208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I got pregnant at 14, with my daughter, and my mother disowned me but we recently got in contact. While I know getting pregnant so young wasn\u2019t the best idea, it was definitely the best decision as my mum was an absolute monster growing up and it lead to her getting out of my life as soon as possible, without me feeling guilty; The names she hurled, having a parent who is adamant they are always right and just making my life that little bit more miserable, also as soon as I started getting older, she became health obsessed and would out much smaller amount of food on my plate so I didn\u2019t end up being \u201cfatter\u201d and snacks were removed from the house and leftovers were very much given to our pet dog, who would literally get more food than me and my brother combined.\n\nWe started speaking again as I believed she\u2019d change and so me, my husband Brad, our daughters and son, went over for Sunday lunch, and everything was fine. The roast dinner was like it was when I was a young child and I truly believed she\u2019d left her time as a unhealthy eating habits behind, but half way through the meal, she stopped us, started taking our plates away, and when my husband asked why, she said:\n\n\u201cI purposely gave you more food than usual for leftovers dog, Anna knows I wouldn\u2019t feed her or the kiddies this much in case they became little fatties, but I probably should have gave little Delilah a little less as she getting on the tubby side\u201d -my child is a perfectly healthy weight-\n\nAs she says all this, I feel like the 12 year old little girl who\u2019s crying because her mums digging at her weight, being made to feel crappy about herself because the woman who\u2019s supposed to love me is micromanaging everything I eat and calling me vicious names, and I\u2019d never allow her to make any of my children feel like that, so I bolt up in rage, before  shouting: \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you even dare take any food off of their plate to give to that dog! If you even try  putting any mental harm on my kids, I\u2019ll make fucking sure you never see us again!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s kind of a silence between the pair of us before an argument ensues, where she claims she\u2019s \u201conly got my best interest at heart\u201d and that \u201cBrad won\u2019t love me anymore if I continue being a fatty\u201d and that I should have lost the baby fat and it wouldn\u2019t have happened if I\u2019d stayed in contact with her. She called me an asshole and a silly whale, before I left with my family, and other family members are saying that while I was right not to let her do that to my kids, I was an asshole for threatening to take her grandchildren away from her, when she\u2019s only just got them back, and now I\u2019m just confused and starting to consider that I may be one for emotional blackmail.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Like, I'm still confused by people who get sad when their grandparents die because why would you care over someone who's never been part of your life? And then I remember, whoops, my experience is out of the norm and families generally love each other.", "Extremely true. I didn\u2019t see my grandma for the last 8ish years of her life because of her bullshit. It made my life better and my dad (who still had LC with her) was more than happy to support my decision.", "Agreed! Every family member who talk about \"what about the grandchildren\" also have a responsibility to protect those children and make sure they aren't psychologically abused.\n\nAny family member who love the thought of that woman gaining access to even more young minds to abuse and neglect can go right the fuck ahead and live with her themselves.", "People on this subreddit are usually too fast to throw out no contact as a solution to a family dispute but this is a case where it actually seems reasonable. Grandma is deeply mentally unwell in a way that probably can't be fixed.", "Yes, those flying monkeys are part of her cycle of abuse. You don't need them in your life either. They allowed her to abuse you when you were younger and more vulnerable.", "Lol so freakin weird. Some people are just miserable and wants others to be miserable too. Hope you realize it\u2019s nothing to do with you.", "Yes, it is toxic when an entire generation gangs up on a person with a legitimate complaint and says \"but she's your mother, the only mother you'll have.\" Get rid of those flying monkeys as well.", "How does OP suck? She\u2019s protecting herself and her family from a monster.", "Wrong. Bullies get held to their actions, even if you're unlucky enough to be related to them. :)", "At the very least OP needs to stop letting this woman be around her kid's when theirs food involved. If OP really wants to continue to allow contact it can be on neutral grounds that don't involve food- like the park, or the library.", "As grown kids, we always still want our parents to love us. It hurts when we find out they don't really care and that they've never changed and never will, what's wrong is when we continue to let them hurt us. Disowning can go both ways.", "Second time only teaches her that the first time was okay. :(", "[removed]", "Just leave then. All the hysterics and drama. And to even expose her kids to this after a lifetime of abuse. And it sounds mostly made up", "My personal experience is that disowning an abusive, insufferable and grating parent is very freeing.\nI'm in favour!", "It takes only one time for it to stick. She's already said and done too much. Let there not be a second time,"]}
