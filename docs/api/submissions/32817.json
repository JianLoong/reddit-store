Her friends had just had a baby, and her name was Tricity.  Okay, not terrible.  Providing she doesn't grow up to run for office.  But Kim asked them how they came up with the name, and they were telling her that it was on a highway sign in Upper New York State, and they liked how it sounded.  Kim asked them, \"Did you serioiusly just name your kid after the Tri-City expressway?\"  \n\n\nThe other funny story is my cousin, who named one of her daughters Abby Gale.

Do you never think that maybe you deserve to put yourself first?\n\nI was brought up on belief that self-care is important too because if you don't care for yourself, few others will and if you keep giving, you burn out and get resentful. If joining the family means being emotionally blackmailed into compliance, I'd take a rain check. Been there, got the scars - not worth the aggro. \n\nAnd you are ignoring the fact when anyone raises it, OP did not feel they had the ability to keep this particular child safe at this particular event.

The only thing I will forward you about is that if they end up needing to do so, because baby's head is soft, it can look a little misshapen right after. It returns to normal in a VERY short space of time, but freaked my husband out quite a bit.

I'm sure things have advanced past that by now.", "Both my niece and my eldest were vacuum-assisted births. Think of it like a big suction cup they insert into your vagina and onto baby's head - then dr puuuuuulls. Carefully and in a trained manor. When my 1st labor wasn't progressing after 3h 44m of pushing, I asked my OB if they were vacuum-trained because I did not want a c-sec. Especially the very tough c-sec that would've been required since my son was fully in the birth canal. \nMy son was born just a couple of min later. And 12 years later, he's still amazing. \nNothing to be frightened of, but you should try to learn as much as you can to have as many options as you can.

It's a public arena, I bet this was a small scale game at a local arena with cameras and parents everywhere. You say to the child \"We will go, but you have to hold my hand.

You can interpret it how you like but my interpretation, based on too many similar experiences, is here comes the emotional blackmail. And that gets old. \n\nAnd you haven't looked after many children under 5 i suspect.

And there were parents everywhere unlike at a hockey game where crowd will be more mixed. My partner did the same. Most parents have a similar story. Usually they end well but sometimes they don't. \n\nI don't need to stay in the main streets. I am an adult and can make decisions about my own safety. But I can equally make decisions about how much responsibility I  will take for another person's. And taking a fretful child away from her familiar people in a crowded place where that child is likely to try and run to find them isn't a gamble I'd take. \"And any running and we need to come right back\" Well, first you need to catch her and children that age aren't the most rational.
