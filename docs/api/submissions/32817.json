Cousins kid would be sitting on a lap or be interacting with a person and start crying, all you had to do was pass the kid onto another person and the kid would magically shut up. \n\nPlus it\u2019s not really appropriate to take a 2 year old to a game and expect them to behave perfectly so the person bringing the kid should take responsibility for taking the kid to the bathroom or a change of scenery when the kid won\u2019t shut up.", "Here comes the what's wrong with Gen Z rant \n\nLike it's so bad to say or do what you want, what you're comfortable with \n\nMaybe she doesn't want to spend that much time with the child?

We're talking about taking an opportunity to be counted on and trusted by the family of someone you say you love, and saying \"nah I don't care about that\". That's sad.

Did you mean to say guilt?\n\nMaybe sometimes guilt is a valid feeling that people should feel. Like anger.", "Listen, I'm not interested in you slapping labels on me that you think I deserve. Your input, means nothing.\n\nBut down the road, when the aunt comments to the bf that she didn't like the gf, or thought she was self centered, well maybe the relationship won't work. Maybe it will. Maybe he will think she was strong for standing up. Maybe he will think she doesn't care about kids or his family. \n\nMe personally?
