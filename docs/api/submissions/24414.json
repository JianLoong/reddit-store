I am perfectly comfortable leaving my preschooler/kindergartener in a crowded theme park by herself because (checks notes) \"she's wearing a watch that can easily be taken off\". \n\nAbsolute 11/10 genius thinking there.", ">He said I was weird for even thinking of this, that I couldn't understand because I didn't have kids,\n\nNTA.  She's 4.  You're correct.  A person could very easily snatch a small 4 year old and he wouldn't even have to carry her screaming from the park to do it.  I just watched a nauseating social experiment film, in which a guy talked kids (ages from 5ish on up to teen years) into getting into his car or going with him to look at puppies.  \n\nEDIT: This guy was able to do this in many cases, with mom or dad sitting on a park bench within eyesight of the child.  Even though we, the viewers, knew this guy was performing an experiment, it was horrifying to watch these kids trustingly go with a total stranger.  The looks on the parents' faces, when they watched it, even though most of them said their child had been well-taught, was awful.\n\nA person doesn't have to be an actual parent to understand that this is dangerous.  It takes just a second for some nice seeming adult (or even children, in some horrifying cases) to tell a kid \"hey, your daddy/mommy is waiting over here, let me take you to him/her.\"", "NTA.\n\nA 4 year old is not autonomous.  Frankly, he sounds a little irresponsible at 35.", "NTA and you are absolutely, 100% correct about this!!! She should NOT EVER be left alone at that age. He needs to go to ride roller coasters when she's with her mother. It's wildly inappropriate for him to do this. Human trafficking is a serious problem.\n\nYou don't have to have kids to know that this is wrong.", "Nta. Run from this relationship. He is telling you he puts his life ahead of someone who is 100% dependent on HIM!!! Think how low on the list you would be! Ask my kids and they will tell you my number one job is to keep them safe. (Physical, mentally, emotionally, etc) He\u2019s failing as a parent. You were right to point that out. Now listen to his red banners and run.", "?? he said his FOUR-YEAR-OLD CHILD was autonomous? is this real lol\n\nNTA. even if it\u2019s unintentional, ignorance doesn\u2019t excuse negligence. his knee-jerk defensiveness in this context is also concerning... if this is genuine then imo he needs to put his ego aside and be receptive to warranted concerns", "Oh dear. NTA I really feel uncomfortable reading this, I guess the actual chance of a kidnapper coming is pretty low but as you say, some watch isn\u2019t going to stop them.\n\nMore than the kidnapper this is just totally irresponsible, what happens if the 4 year old decides she wants to climb into a fountain. Yeah the watch will tell you where she is but doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to stop her from coming to harm.\n\nJust sounds like he puts the roller coasters ahead of her and so I\u2019m predicting some expensive therapy in years to come", "NTA. He does sound very immature for someone with a child though!", "*But my child would never follow a stranger !*\n\n\\- Most parent of kidnapped children\n\nNTA.", "NTA - the title comes off creepy but you are correct,\n4 is WAY too young to be leaving his daughter alone waiting for him in a busy amusement park!! You are right to be concerned\u2026", "NTA and you are absolutely correct.", "NTA - the intrusive thoughts won but I would bet he\u2019s second guessing leaving his kid alone at a theme park like that\n\nEdit: not even an intrusive thought really, just an uncomfortable truth lol", "NTA. The mom should know that he\u2019s doing this! I bet she has no idea. That\u2019s just simply dangerous. Not only could she be kidnapped she could go into a restricted area and get seriously injured if not worse.", "NTA. I have a 5 year old and my heart dropped when I read this. What he's doing is incredibly dangerous and I would be willing to bet her mother doesn't know he does that.", "NTA, he's being unbelievably irresponsible. 4 years old is *way* too young to be left unattended in a crowded public place.", "NTA, he is a shitty father", "NTA. I'd follow him then call CPS on him the first time he leaves her unattended in one of those trips.", "NTA he thinks YOU are weird for thinking about that?  You sound like a more concerned \"parent\" than this guy wtf. Some people are just too optimistic about the workd and think it will not happen to them. Lucky for me I am paranoid and do not trust people, although I do not pass it onto my kids. I internalize it but stay vigilant.", "Does this guy have developmental delays? He sounds slow. What an incredibly dangerous and alarmingly stupid thing to do. He shouldn\u2019t have a child\u2026.he doesn\u2019t even consider himself an authoritative figure, meaning his parenting is going to be shit as she gets older as well.", "NTA Leaving a 4-year-old unattended at a busy place like a theme park does raise valid concerns, and discussing potential risks doesn't make you judgmental or out of line. It's clear that your intentions come from a place of genuine worry for the child's safety, and that's a natural and responsible reaction.", "The guy is a huge child.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nAdam is totally out of touch and if CPS ever heard about this, there would certainly be an investigation and in the least some action taken so this behavior won't happen again.\n\nDoes he think that NO ONE willing to take/abuse/moleste a child will also first remove any phone or watch from her?  I mean the CHILD is 4, not 14.  That would be a lovely look in the news \"4 year old kidnapped after Father abandons her at Six Flags so he can ride the Roller Coaster.\"", "NTA. A classic \"the title sounds insane but they're actually in the right\" post. I wouldn't leave a kid twice her age alone at a busy theme park.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to ride roller coasters without his daughter, he shouldn't bring her to the park. He's lucky that nothing happened so far, but leaving a 4 year old in a big park is irresponsible.", "NTA\n\nI'm curious what CPS would say to a 4 year old being left unattended in a crowded theme park \ud83e\udd14", "I think Chid protection services need to decide. You did fine letting him know, and oh how about they can declare him unfit as a parent. NTA. Tell the mom and hopefully she will handle it.", "NTA. What your friend is doing is completely irresponsible and child neglect. You are correct, a theme park is a likely spot for a kidnapping and once again, as you say, the kidnapper would immediately rip the tracker band off. \n\nYou don't have to have children to know this, you only have to read the newspapers or listen to the news on television. Or know the tiniest bit about human nature. \n\nThis is very scary behaviour and your friend could be charged with child abandonment - or far worse could happen.", "NTA    if you have the option tell the child's mother what he is doing.", "NTA. I can see why he is separated. I wonder if the ex knows how irresponsible he is with their child.

Daughter must be really brave because I'd be crying every time my dad just left me alone in the park. Not even out of fear, just embarrassment to be alone.

Any grown adult could easily just pick your kid up and walk away. Not to mention they might get bored or distracted and wander off while daddy is in line or on the ride. 4 is old enough to have a brain and kind of listen, but not old enough to really understand danger or what could happen in that situation if they don't listen, and definitely not old enough to protect themselves from a dangerous adult. \n\nI would definitely tell mom, I feel like this is irresponsible parenting and borderline neglect.", "I wouldn\u2019t even leave my 10-year-old unattended like that\u2026good grief!

And what if he is on the top of the roller coaster ride and her watch alerts that she is not where she is supposed to be? He can\u2019t get off to find her and by the time he does, the damage is done. Any child that is molested is affected for life, and even with intensive therapy, their trust is broken.

Don't talk to strangers because they may want to take them away from us and never give them back.
