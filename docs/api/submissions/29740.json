Our kids are 7m and 5f. I have three stepchildren from my husband's first marriage to his late wife. My stepkids are 17f, 16f and 15m. Their mom passed away from cancer 10 years ago. My stepkids are very close to their maternal side of the family and spend time with them frequently. They enjoy having their mom's parents and siblings close.\n\nMy stepkids have struggled with my marriage to their dad and their half siblings. I think most kids do struggle with that. Honestly, looking at it now so many years later, I feel like the speed of things played a role as well as how much the kids idealized the idea of my husband staying loyal to their mom after her death. This is something that they mentioned in family therapy we all did. The kids did get grief therapy after their mom's death also.\n\nAs a family we're big on taking photos and we take as many as we can. It has been pointed out on several occasions that my stepkids do not look very happy when sibling photos are taken with their younger siblings. Or when family photos are taken with the seven of us. My husband and his parents compare them to photos of the three together without anyone else and especially to the ones taken while with their maternal side of the family. The beaming smiles and fond expressions are things that bother my husband and his parents because you never see them with our kids or with us as a family.\n\nI can admit it does make me sad that there is such a difference. But to me it's one of those things that you can't really do anything about. You can talk to the kids more and bring therapy back into the equation but in reality, especially at those ages, it feels like it would only push them away more.\n\nThe topic of conversation was brought up far more in the last few weeks when several photos were posted of their time with their maternal family and my husband and his parents went through them again and again and they brought this up around our kids. Now our children are upset and I was asked if their siblings don't like the family, etc. It is not something they have ever expressed before. So it feels like they are very much picking up on their dad and grandparents feelings on this.\n\nMy husband and his parents were upset about the kids being upset and they were trying to blame my stepkids maternal family and I told them it was on them, not the maternal family. I said they are the ones who are pointing out these differences where the children can hear and making things worse for the kids. My ILs said they were worrying about their grandkids. While my husband said he would never want to hurt our children. I pointed out they had obsessed over the details and filled the kids with their worries, because the kids were fine before.\n\nMy ILs are now claiming I'm the biggest person at fault for being unfair and accusing them wrongly.

I know my husband wasn't intentionally doing it and neither were his parents so I feel like where I might be TA is in how harsh my words were toward them and their part in all of this.

Once or twice fine but after you notice every picture they were unhappy why did you continue?", "You are awesome. You are EXACTLY the kind of stepmom that grieving teenagers deserve. Thank you for being this good at something so incredibly difficult.\n\nI'm sorry that your husband and his parents are hurt by the teenage kids' feelings. They are entitled to feel saddened but you are right: they imbued the younger kids with this upset by their own words and actions. Stand firm in your position. It is righteous and you are protecting all of the kids. \n\nYou ILs can get wrecked. They are wrong. Their double down doesn't change that. They will have to come to that realization. Otherwise, you should limit how much time the younger, impressionable children spend with them - especially unsupervised. They don't mean to but they are causing damage. \n\nI'm so sorry for your step kids. I'm so sorry for your little kids. I'm so sorry for the loss in your family. But you are an absolute champ for being as honest, understanding and supportive as you are.  NTA by a long shot.", "NTA - You guys are in a tight spot. It seems like a no win situation. But you weren't wrong with bringing your concerns to them, nor are you the biggest person at fault here. Your husband and his parent's do need to quit fixating on this though. I mean there's not too much that can be done about it. Maybe since they don't seem to happy to want to take the pics give them an option. Your husband should address this directly. \"Hey, we noticed you don't seem very happy in the photos with us. We know that you guys struggle with the fact that your step-mother and I are together and have children. We love you and of course we want you in the family photos because you are apart of this family. But we don't want you to feel like you are forced to do something,. If you would like to participate less in the photos we would understand.\"", "\" I told them it was on them, not the maternal family. I said they are the ones who are pointing out these differences where the children can hear and making things worse for the kids.\"  NTA and your are exactly right. You husband may never have meant to hurt his children but he has! The grandparents need to accept reality and leave the material grandparents out of this.", "Nta that's a tough spot but it sounds like your husband and his family's insistence are making it worse. Good for you for being a sane step parent.", "NTA. I would also like you to consider that the kids are unhappy in the photos because you all won\u2019t stop taking pictures. Whereas their moms side maybe only takes a couple.", "NTA \nYou're trying your best and I'm sure your step kids also appreciate that you're not trying to force your relationship with them. They find their happiness in their mother's side of the family and nothing is wrong about that. And those who are saying that ' you should not click pictures with your step kids if they don't want to' , they're not understanding that if you didn't click pictures with them then this is going to be an another issue because then everyone will be saying that 'you don't love them and don't see them as family and all that shit'. So I totally understand your point of view. However what I'm going to suggest to you is that you don't discuss this topic with your step kids. They're already trying their best, don't put more burden on them. They are in therapy, that's good. Talk to your husband and make him understand that you all are doing your best you can't force them to be happy unless they want to be happy.\nGood luck \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n(I hope I have written my thoughts correctly, sorry for any mistake because english is not my first language)", "NTA\n\nTough situation for the step kids, and you\u2019re right that bringing it up in front of the kids is only making things worse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
