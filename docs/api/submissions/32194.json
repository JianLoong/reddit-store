So I yelled at him for doing this without getting my consent first. He's insisting it doesn't matter if it gets fixed since it's functional and all the damage is cosmetic. But the car is like a year old. I want it to get fixed. He doesn't understand why I care about the value of the car if I wasn't planning on selling or trading it in. And now I would have to eat the cost of the deductible, rental, and raise in insurance rates for a car that probably lost like 75% of its value after this. I'm so worried insurance won't cover the damage since he went and got it tuned up before I was able to submit pictures and have the insurance company come assess the damage. AITA for yelling at him over this?\n\nEdit: I took pictures of the damage immediately when the accident occurred.
