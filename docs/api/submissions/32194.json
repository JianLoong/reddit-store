There was damage to the front bumper, headlights, front tires, and sides of the car. It was functional, but i didn't feel super safe driving it because of the way the bumper dragged on the ground, and some of the damage to the sides of the car was scraping against the tire. I was trying to file a claim with insurance. While I was on the phone with my insurance company, my boyfriend took the damaged car to an auto shop and got it tuned up so it looks more presentable, and the bumper wasn't hanging off it so it was drivable.\n\nHe looked so proud of himself when he got home since the car looked more normal besides a bunch of scrapes and dents and a missing front grate. But tbh my heart sank. My insurance company had asked me to take pictures of all the damage, which I no longer could do. My insurance company also would have paid for a rental car as part of the claim since it wasn't initially safe to drive. Now, I don't know. I'm worried insurance will see pictures of the car in its tuned up state and refuse to cover anything, but I'll still be hit with the increase in insurance rates. So I yelled at him for doing this without getting my consent first. He's insisting it doesn't matter if it gets fixed since it's functional and all the damage is cosmetic. But the car is like a year old. I want it to get fixed. He doesn't understand why I care about the value of the car if I wasn't planning on selling or trading it in. And now I would have to eat the cost of the deductible, rental, and raise in insurance rates for a car that probably lost like 75% of its value after this. I'm so worried insurance won't cover the damage since he went and got it tuned up before I was able to submit pictures and have the insurance company come assess the damage. AITA for yelling at him over this?\n\nEdit: I took pictures of the damage immediately when the accident occurred. Insurance won't accept them and wants them taken a very specific way through the app. I had also specifically told him before he took the car not to do anything with it until I had figured things out with insurance", "created_utc": 1701533263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1896v3c/aita_for_yelling_at_my_boyfriend_for_fixing_my_car/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ultimately it was not his place to take / drive your car without your permission. That's imo the most important part of this argument. \n\nHowever, next time (and hopefully there isn't a next time) *please* just take pictures right after the accident. There is no point in waiting to take them while you're driving your damaged car. That's also a possible issue for your insurance bc otherwise you could've caused more damage by negligently driving your car. Just a heads up for the future.", "NTA because he should have asked.  It's your car, not his, and you had valid concerns.  The car is still obviously damaged so insurance should cover some of that.  If your insurance covers rentals while it's being repaired it's still likely going to have time in the shop as well.", "NTA because you needed to file the claim correctly with pictures of the damage and to get the car fixed properly. \n\nI don't know what a tune up does to the outside of a car.\n\nHe shouldn't be doing anything like that without your permission.\n\nAlso it's kind of weird that he doesn't know why you want a proper repair to a relatively new vehicle.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand what your bf was thinking. (I agree yelling never works but understand it can happen when you\u2019re upset.) We just had an accident while I was driving with my daughter with her permit and they wanted pictures/ video from the police and insurance adjuster, to know which mechanic we\u2019d be using, they\u2019re very strict with policy.", "NTA. Not only your boyfriend disobeyed what you said about how to proceed with YOUR car, but also he did it even if you told him that you were waiting for the insurance's response.  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.", "NTA, \n\nHe has scuppered your insurance claim.\n\nYou are still going to need to get the car looked at He has only dealt with the cosmetic, in any accident/collision it is likely that there is further damage you cant see. The car may well be dangerous to drive.\n\nYour BF although well intentioned has now cost you money, in increased insurance premium. The car was only a year old, he may well have invalidated your warranty as well. Tell him he is going to have to pay the increase on your premium and get the car back to the garage, preferably the main dealer you bought it from for a proper safety check and repairs.", "NTA. Boyfriend is a moron who cost you potentially a fully repairable and like new car. He should have talked to you before he made you clame more complicated.", "NTA - he should have asked first because yes it is important to take photos for insurance. his heart was in the right place so yelling may not have been the best, but i\u2019d say he was in the wrong nonetheless.", "NTA. Your bf stole your car and screwed up your insurance claim.  He wasn't helpful.  He was dismissive and misogynistic.\n\nIs there a term for taking action that coincides with mansplaining? He was rescuing the poor damsel from a situation that OP was handling just fine. He overruled OPs decision because she's just a girl, and you know how girls are.\n\nAn insurance adjuster could look at the damage and rule that it may have been caused by the mechanic, not the accident. It can be a nightmare to fight an insurance company", "INFO: How long was this  phone call that \"While I was on the phone with my insurance company, my boyfriend took the damaged car to an auto shop and got it tuned up so it looks more presentable, and the bumper wasn't hanging off it so it was drivable\"?", "Print out pictures you've taken then take a picture of them through the app???", "NTA. Your BF had the best of intentions, but he really should have left things alone.\n\nI work in an Auto Body shop in the front office so I deal with a lot of the ins-and-outs of insurance in the US. You are spot on about the insurance company and the photos. They may/should cover some or all of the damage, but there might be a different issue.\n\nIf you brought the car to our shop, we would refuse the job. If another mechanic and/or auto body shop starts to work on a repair, we will not touch it. Things get very, very complicated about whether the initial damage was from the collision, or the other shop... sounds kind of silly, but that is how our insurance companies deal with things like this.\n\nI wish you the best. Does your BF often go ahead and do things that you ask him not to? or interfere with things that are none of his business?", "NTA, but dang that was a *really* long call with the insurance company.", "NTA. Insurance is already a huge scam, don\u2019t waste your own money when you finally get to use theirs. I know he was trying to help, but what a bonehead lol", "The damage is still there, just not as severe. You had to make the car safe to drive", "Soft YTA. You should\u2019ve taken the pictures immediately after the accident. Yes he made your insurance claim difficult which is understandably frustrating. But yelling at someone who went out of their way to help you is AH behavior. Especially when you raised concerns about being able to drive safely with it in the previous condition. Don\u2019t be surprised if he sees you struggling in another situation and just turns the other way since he gets screamed at for caring.", "Nta your fall for not taking photos as soon as you got into it.", "NTA - You were already handling the situation; per your comments he was asked not to step in, but did so anyway.\n\n  \nHe did something compulsive instead of using his head and considering that you're a whole human who can handle their issues without assistance.  I appreciate that he thought he was trying to be sweet, but he's not a child and his actions were half-conceived and immature.  He's now cost you a lot of money and put you in a tight spot with insurance, which may raise your rates.  You have a right to be upset with what he did.  \nI'm not a fan of yelling, but I don't think you were in the wrong, either.", "ESH, did you tell your bf you didn\u2019t do any of the insurance things? You weren\u2019t trying to file an insurance claim on time, if you didn\u2019t take any pictures or do any of the background work. Your bf saw your helplessness and did you a favor. The car shop should have a receipt you can turn that in.", "You\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing. There is nothing wrong with making the vehicle safe for you to drive until it is taken for repairs. You are the asshole.", "ESH - pictures should have been taken immediately.  he should know not to mess with an ongoing investigation.  how does he get away with your car and you don\u2019t know where he\u2019s going / what he\u2019s doing?  yelling .. don\u2019t yell.  he was trying to be nice.  albeit short sighted.  world won\u2019t end.  apologize, move on", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you would have refused the work, is it safe to say that most reputable auto body shops would do the same?\n\nI'm wondering if he isn't being honest about what he actually did with the car.\n\n**Going back and re-reading, OP explained that she was on the phone for several hours. It still seems like a short amount of time to be gone", "I did take pictures immediately.

Honestly taking pictures in either state should not change your adjuster\u2019s repair quote much if any. Remember that their job is to determine cost to get it back to factory not to make it drivable. \n\nTake it to some shops and get your own quotes as well. You do not have to take your insurance adjuster\u2019s appraisal. Insurance companies want to give you as little as possible.", "IF that\u2019s all he had fixed then you\u2019re really blowing this out of proportion. Many people have to do similar things before they can even leave the scene of an accident. \n\nStay calm. Breathe. All you have to do is tell the insurance company you had to do some temporary fixes to drive it in the meantime. Any real insurance company will understand this justification."]}
