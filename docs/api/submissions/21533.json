It infuriated me to no end.", "NTA - I'd feel the same, though I have to ask if he is big on words of affirmation? He may be seeking recognition and praise because that's his love language.

Thanks love!\" Etc", "Yeah exactly, it depends on how he responds.

When my (now) husband and I first moved in together he said stuff like this until I stopped \u201chelping \u201c him.

I\u2019m so glad that we got a lot of the workload discussions taken care of early before we got married and had kids. What you\u2019re expressing OP is yet another example of the unequal physical and mental load carried by most women and the justified anger of many modern women that men are to be praised for doing their fair share. The days when most women were homemakers are over and yet we\u2019re still expected to either do the the majority of the unpaid work or give out participation trophies to adults. Working women aren\u2019t \u201chelping\u201d or praised everyday for going to work by their partners, so why do men think that they should get acknowledgement every time they do a domestic task?
