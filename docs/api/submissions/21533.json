But I agree that when he says he\u2019s \u201chelping\u201d, that implies that they are YOUR tasks. It\u2019s like saying a dad babysits his kids. When he is just as much of a parent as a mom.\n\nHow does your husband respond when you ask him to choose different words instead of \u201chelp\u201d?", "The only appropriate time to use \"help\" in this situation is if you are tasked with something and he decided to join you in that task. I don't blame you for being frustrated with that warning. Usually it's just \"I did the dishes\" \" I took out the trash\"", "NTA but you definitely seem to have some sensitivity to the wording... I'm the same way, Words imply a lot of information frfr", "NAH\n\nHave you told him that this verbiage is upsetting to you? Because I do not think he is an AH for saying that (assuming he is not aware of your frustration). Rather I think that it\u2019s a teaching moment regarding the inherent sexism involved in assigning household chores based on gender roles. I also do not think you are an AH for being upset by it. \n\nI think you should probably just sit him down and tell him why phrasing it that way bothers you so much. And explain to him that the same is going to be true of child care (assuming you ever have children together)\u2026 Dads don\u2019t *babysit* their kids, dad\u2019s *parent* their kids, for example.", "NAH, just work on communication that they are shared tasks. Let him know how you feel about how he talks about chores and reach an understanding on responsibilities around the house.", "NTA. \n\n\"You aren't helping *me*, you're helping yourself. If the laundry doesn't get done, there are no clothes for you to wear. If the washing up doesn't get done there are no dishes for food for you to eat. Unless you are willing to take ownership of your fair share of the chores for *both* of us, and stop acting like taking care of yourself is doing me a favour, I will split the chores down the middle. You can do *your chores* and I'll do *mine*. I'll wash up *my* plate, wash *my* clothes, clean *my* car, take out *my* garbage. *You* can do yours until you learn to share the load, including figuring out what needs to be done *on your own*. I don't want to have to tell you when chores need doing. You have eyes, you can see when the garbage is full or the dishes need washing. Step up or find out exactly what it takes to live in a functional household.\"", "NAH It's pretty common phrasing, even when talking about communal chores, like dishes or laundry. It doesn't necessarily mean he thinks it's *your* job. \n\nHowever, it does irritate you. Tell him that and why, and offer some other phrasing. 'I helped *with* the dishes' or plain 'I did the laundry'. If he slips, remind him. Every. Time. In a calm but firm tone, not annoyed. \n\nOr you can let it go as a figure of speech rather than a veiled dig.

Have you told him it bothers you and why?", "YTA. I say this because it makes you angry, but you haven\u2019t talked to him about it. \n\nI don\u2019t love the term \u2018helped\u2019 either, but it sounds like he does chores without you having to manage him.

Not sure how I'd deal with it if my partner persisted in saying \"help\". I'm a bit stubborn so I'd probably turn the tables, and start saying \"here, I've helped you by cooking dinner\", \"I helped you to keep the house clean by wiping down the benches\". If that didn't work, I'd tell him all of the chores now belonged to him and to let me know which he wanted me to \"help\" with, and then I'd go and play video games until he asked for something.", "I'm gonna go with a soft YTA, given your comment on him working from home and dealing with the kids. There's a division of labor, but he's definitely doing more than you (60/40 as you stated).\n\n\nI think you might want to look into your sensitivity with the word 'Help', because from what I'm seeing from your post, I don't really know what other word he could use. It's a pretty neutral, standard word to use when two people do the same thing.", "good point\n\nconversely, as a dad I\u2019d be quite annoyed if someone repeatedly said I was \u201cbabysitting\u201d my son", "I was going to say that same thing about babysitting your own kids.

We have one daughter and we split the responsibilities for her down the middle. (Maybe 60/40 on his part. He does alllll the stress of getting her up, ready for school, packing her lunch, etc).", "We hardly ever argue and I haven\u2019t even brought this distaste for \u201chelp\u201d up to him because I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s annoying and he\u2019s subconsciously putting theses tasks under \u201cme\u201d and not \u201cus\u201d, or if it was innocent. I just didn\u2019t know if my concern was outlandish. Ty!!", "Why is he listing things he \"helped\" you with? Are you telling him he is not contributing and he is defending himself or is he just listing off things for no apparent reason?", "NTA", "So if he's doing his part then Whats the problem? You're being petty honestly stop looking into it so much", "YTA\n\nYou're getting upset over some feminist power struggle that only exists in your head.\n\nHe is helping you, you're helping him, that's what married couples do.\n\nYou could also just ask him what he means, he is your husband after all \ud83e\udd37", " NTA- have you tried turning it around on him? Letting him know YOU helped HIM by doing the dishes, etc?", "NTA - ask him if he\u2019d mind switching it to \u201cI helped us by doing the dishes\u201d or you could just start saying it back to him.", "I'd say it depends on context.  Do you have consistenly \"assigned\" chores?  Like if one person always cooks and the other person always cleans after, then it would be reasonable to say you're helping them with their job.", "And then they expect a treat and praise!", "Good job on not reading.", "I disagree, if one person has a lower tolerance for untidiness than the other but they're making the effort to clean up in accordance with their partners standard then they're doing it for them.", "That\u2019s not help that\u2019s doing everything.", "well we both do things, he just does more for me", "Nta. You should tell him that the wording bothers you, why, and what phrases/wording you would prefer he use when discussing the topic in the future. He may not realize what he's implying, especially if he grew up hearing family members say stuff like that.", "NTA\u2014 language matters, more than our society really likes to believe. It's not just words, it's the thought process behind them.", "NTA, last week my husband had a few days off. I was working from home. When I finished work I still had to wipe down the kitchen counters (crumbs from his toast that morning), gave the bathroom a quick wipe down (it was due), and few other little things.\n\nWhen he asked what I was doing I yelled at him and said sarcastically it's great that he had a day off and I still end up cleaning. He stupidly responded with \"why didn't you ask me\"? \nI told him he has eyes and should be more than capable of seeing what needs to be done. He says something like I know I know and I respond with something like , then why do seem to have the augment every few months??\n\nAs far as I am concerned he lives in the house and is just as responsible for it as I am.", "There was an article about this. The wife having to train herself out of \"do me a favor\" and care for your kid/pick up your own mess, etc.  Google failed me however, so I'm commenting in case anyone else knows it.\n\nAlso NTA, they aren't helping, they are existing, same as you.", "Absolutely NTA \n\nYou help someone cross the street. You help someone unconscious on the street. Helping is going out of your way to reach out to someone even when you didn't need to. \n\nYou are right to feel upset when your husband claims he is helping by doing chores that are supposed to be part of his day to day life. By claiming that he's helping, he has mentally assigned you in charge of those tasks and is acting like he's doing you a favour. \n\nMy dad does the same thing. He stirs the pot once while my mom makes the entire 3 course meal and says he helped and expects to get the highest praise while not extending the same praise to my mom.", "YTA\nYou're definitely reading too much into it. The internet perhaps isn't the best place either to ask when you know you might be reading too much into something. Couples help each other. Helping you with something doesn't mean he views it as your responsibility. You're truly just reading something into nothing.", "NAH\n\nI see your point but I believe you are overthinking it. This isn't about whose job it is. You both are helping each other", "I get your point, but if my wife does something, I consider her helping, as, without her help, it would all fall on me. And vice versa. I have had to do everything myself and it sucks. Lol I appreciate everything she does as help because it really is help. \n\nThat being said, just explain to him why you hate that wording and work on yourself as well. There's no reason that should make you so angry, except personal reasons, which means it's a personal problem. And there's no reason he shouldn't want to avoid that weird for you. Neither of you are the asshole. He can try not to use the word, you can try not to get unreasonably angry about it.", "Unless he is bringing home all the bacon and you are  a SAHW, NTA. If he is and you are, then YTA. In the case of the latter, all those things ARE your task brcause that's how you counteract his contributions to the family. If you both work though, you both do chores.", "NTA.  But you have to communicate to your husband how it makes you feel and why.  My ex and mother of my 3 children left the home, and then would come watch the kids at my house while I worked.  I payed her for this, and she often said she was the kids \"babysitter\".  She's their mom, not babysitter.  I pointed it out, but she continued to say she was \"babysitting\" the kids for me.  It infuriated me to no end.", "NTA - I'd feel the same, though I have to ask if he is big on words of affirmation? He may be seeking recognition and praise because that's his love language. Does he offer you verbal encouragement e.g. \"wow the living room looks so much better!\" \"Oh perfect timing doing the laundry, I was running out of socks. Thanks love!\" Etc", "Yeah exactly, it depends on how he responds. If he didn't know at first then that's ok, but if she told him and he keeps saying it like that then that's not cool I don't think, but I'm a guy.", "And then what happens if, and probably when, he just says thanks without reading into it so much. Imo this is just oversensitive nitpicking on wording. Couples help each other as a team, help is a perfectly natural word for what couples do for each other and themselves", "Yeah why do you need to ask a grown ass man to take care of his home? Make it make sense! \n\nIf you want to be petty: Since he wants to act like a child, treat him like one lol. Congratulate him for putting on matching socks and tying his shoes!", "I think so too. One of us can't make our bed from scratch, it's needs two people so he helps me. Doesn't mean it's my job, but we are working together. Same as he asked if I would help him with a job outside yesterday but that doesn't mean it's his job alone to do.", "Right?! My husband used to get this all the time and it honestly hurt him each time.", "My wife used to get REALLY mad at me for wanting to be thanked for doing my half of the housework.\n\nI tried to back off as much as I could, but I always thank her for doing her part (and her part is much less than half these days) - I just grew up in a household where my parents thanked each other, and I found it loving and nice to treat housework as something we do for each other (rather than purely for ourselves). She's a lot better about thanking me these days, but I think she finds it weird that I'm legitimately happier doing 90% of the housework and hearing a \"thank you, darling\" than I am doing 50% with no appreciation at all.", "I like the idea of congratulating him for minuscule things like getting his own glass of water, and getting dressed by himself way more than I should. \n\nThanks for the idea", "Without trying to be snarky, why should you be thanked for doing what\u2019s expected?\n\nDo you expect your boss to thank you every day for turning up and doing your job?"]}
