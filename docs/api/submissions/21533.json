But I agree that when he says he\u2019s \u201chelping\u201d, that implies that they are YOUR tasks. It\u2019s like saying a dad babysits his kids. When he is just as much of a parent as a mom.\n\nHow does your husband respond when you ask him to choose different words instead of \u201chelp\u201d?", "The only appropriate time to use \"help\" in this situation is if you are tasked with something and he decided to join you in that task. I don't blame you for being frustrated with that warning. Usually it's just \"I did the dishes\" \" I took out the trash\"", "NTA but you definitely seem to have some sensitivity to the wording... I'm the same way, Words imply a lot of information frfr", "NAH\n\nHave you told him that this verbiage is upsetting to you? Because I do not think he is an AH for saying that (assuming he is not aware of your frustration). Rather I think that it\u2019s a teaching moment regarding the inherent sexism involved in assigning household chores based on gender roles. I also do not think you are an AH for being upset by it. \n\nI think you should probably just sit him down and tell him why phrasing it that way bothers you so much. And explain to him that the same is going to be true of child care (assuming you ever have children together)\u2026 Dads don\u2019t *babysit* their kids, dad\u2019s *parent* their kids, for example.", "NAH, just work on communication that they are shared tasks. Let him know how you feel about how he talks about chores and reach an understanding on responsibilities around the house.", "NTA. \n\n\"You aren't helping *me*, you're helping yourself. If the laundry doesn't get done, there are no clothes for you to wear. If the washing up doesn't get done there are no dishes for food for you to eat. Unless you are willing to take ownership of your fair share of the chores for *both* of us, and stop acting like taking care of yourself is doing me a favour, I will split the chores down the middle. You can do *your chores* and I'll do *mine*. I'll wash up *my* plate, wash *my* clothes, clean *my* car, take out *my* garbage. *You* can do yours until you learn to share the load, including figuring out what needs to be done *on your own*. I don't want to have to tell you when chores need doing. You have eyes, you can see when the garbage is full or the dishes need washing. Step up or find out exactly what it takes to live in a functional household.\"", "NAH It's pretty common phrasing, even when talking about communal chores, like dishes or laundry. It doesn't necessarily mean he thinks it's *your* job. \n\nHowever, it does irritate you. Tell him that and why, and offer some other phrasing. 'I helped *with* the dishes' or plain 'I did the laundry'. If he slips, remind him. Every. Time. In a calm but firm tone, not annoyed. \n\nOr you can let it go as a figure of speech rather than a veiled dig.

Have you told him it bothers you and why?", "YTA. I say this because it makes you angry, but you haven\u2019t talked to him about it. \n\nI don\u2019t love the term \u2018helped\u2019 either, but it sounds like he does chores without you having to manage him. So \u2018help\u2019 sounds more like a phrase he uses without thinking than his attitude about household responsibilities.", "[deleted]", "Nothing else to argue over?

Not sure how I'd deal with it if my partner persisted in saying \"help\". I'm a bit stubborn so I'd probably turn the tables, and start saying \"here, I've helped you by cooking dinner\", \"I helped you to keep the house clean by wiping down the benches\". If that didn't work, I'd tell him all of the chores now belonged to him and to let me know which he wanted me to \"help\" with, and then I'd go and play video games until he asked for something.", "I'm gonna go with a soft YTA, given your comment on him working from home and dealing with the kids. There's a division of labor, but he's definitely doing more than you (60/40 as you stated).\n\n\nI think you might want to look into your sensitivity with the word 'Help', because from what I'm seeing from your post, I don't really know what other word he could use. It's a pretty neutral, standard word to use when two people do the same thing.", "good point\n\nconversely, as a dad I\u2019d be quite annoyed if someone repeatedly said I was \u201cbabysitting\u201d my son", "I was going to say that same thing about babysitting your own kids.
