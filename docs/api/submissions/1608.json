From housing to college tuition to miscellaneous expenses, I bear them all.\n\nShe recently got admitted in a college that's far off from our house. It takes her 4 hours of travelling by public transport daily to commute to and from the college. \n\nI decided to find a place for her near college (she won't live on campus because the quality isn't good).

I've been spending hours finding a \"nice\" home for her. \n\nMy sister is always open to me about relationships etc. But today, she lied to me about visiting a friend (really elaborate lies) and instead went to see someone else.

Why do you feel that's any of your business? Do you really feel that she, as a fellow **adult**, is not privy/entitled to privacy, regarding her personal life? I'm just trying to understand your line of thinking.\n\nRegardless of the INFO, YWBTA. She's 19. An **adult**. She's allowed to have a relationship with someone. And she's allowed to keep that relationship private, if she chooses to. And, she's allowed to go wherever she pleases. It really does sound like she probably lied to you about where she was going because she thinks you're overbearing and controlling. Maybe perhaps in the past, she's opened up to you about a relationship, and maybe perhaps you didn't like the person she was seeing, so you held something she relied on you for (perhaps college money) over her head (\"you can date them, but I won't be paying for your education anymore\"), because honestly,  just reading your *post*, I could imagine you as being the type to do that. Sure, it's an assumption of you based off limited info, but food for thought, regardless. \n\nIf you have a history of \"hurt feelings\" when she doesn't do what **you want**, or tell you what you *feel* entitled to know, I could totally see why she'd lie to you and never share things with you again.\n\nHonestly, your AITA comes off as controlling, petty, entitled, and overbearing.\n\nYou said you \"believe\" it's a guy she's dating that she went to see, which leads *me* to believe that you may have no proof that she went to see this guy; that you're *assuming* she went to see him. If that's the case, you're double the asshole. Even if you did have proof she was seeing him, it's none of your business, and she has the right to keep her dating life private, if she wants.\n\nSure, you're allowed to cease house-hunting with her. You're allowed to do whatever you wish, regarding supporting her.

No, AH for the sister for me.\n\nBut don't stop the search and be petty. I think you will be better when at some point she's out of your hair too. You are still young and should enjoy your life too and not be burdened with taking care of your sister. She is 19, she can also do house hunting.

HOUSEHOLD. \nYTA.\nBecause you're punishing her for her acting as if she has to protect herself. \nWhich tells me that you're probably not even remotely aware that the abuse most likely intensified for her in ways you can't imagine after you moved out. Something tells me that your parents may have played on her fears as a younger teenager to plant deep seeds of mistrust. I wouldn't be surprised if she literally has zero trust in anyone or anything. \nDid you think your parents only did it to you? Did you think that yours is the only experience that counts?

Did you move her out with you or leave her behind and just try to step in when you knew about something?\nYou're looking at this from a very one sided perspective. It's not all about you. Stop making it personal. \nAs a former foster parent, I'd have the strong thoughts of \"oh, jeez. These kids need therapy. Hmm. How can I bring it up without stepping on toes now that they are adults?\". (My wife would just give me that look, roll her eyes at me, then turn to y'all and say \"that's messed up. You need to talk to someone. I know a couple of resources if you'd like. You hungry?\" and proceed to offer you the contact information while mothering you silly. Tends to be why our house still sees our grown fosters underfoot all the time. )\nI'm not deliberately being harsh. But in my experience,  abuse survivors tend to have tunnel vision and don't realize they themselves have behaviors that are bordering on abusive in their relationships. Because it's what they were taught. Breaking that is hard. So, yeah, therapy. \nGive yourself grace. Realize that you're still healing. Your sister has to heal too. If you want to have a healthy relationship with her, thus means you're probably going to have to sit her down and talk to her about it. Which she may be uncomfortable with. Doesn't have to be a huge production. Can be short, like \"hey, shit went down when we were growing up. It messed me up. It messed you up. I get things can be weird. I get you might not trust me a lot. I want us to be good. And I know it's going to take time. Just wanted to say I realize this and that it's ok. Let's just take each day and figure it out. Maybe go talk to someone. But let's try to build something good,  yeah?\". Because she's probably not aware she's doing it, either. \nThink of it this way: you both got burned. You got brand A burn cream. She got brand b burn cream.  Neither burn cream was wrong,  even though you may not like brand b.

You said she's a good kis and supportive at home - that's setting her up for failure.\n\nYou should accompany her for ONE DAY and ride with her 2 hrs each way and see if you could handle that.\n\nHowever - all of this said - you're not her parent. Where are your parents in this situation? I love my sister but I wouldn't buy a house based off my siblings proximity to school. You'd be accountable for that house long after she potentially graduates. It is something I'd do - Maybe for my child.\n\nIt's assholish if you already promise this and change your mind over her \"having a bf\". It's not assholish to set a boundary and say, \"I cannot fund this \" etc", "Time for a heart to heart talk. Get all the facts. tell her how you feel. Then talk some more. Sort it out and don't let ot fester.", "Agreed. It sounds like OP has taken on more of a parental role in her sister's life and expects the sister to tell her everything. That's just not fair or realistic. The sister is a young woman, and should be able to keep some parts of her life private until she is ready to share them.", "> Wanting sister level clearance while having mom level authority is a pipe dream\n\nGreat way to put it honestly. It\u2019s the same as being a parent and wanting to be your child\u2019s friend. It\u2019s hard to be both.\n\nYou\u2019re an incredible sister/mom OP. Because of you, and your efforts, and all of your sacrifices your sister will have a good life! Be proud! \n\nThen decide when you\u2019re done raising her, and be her sister again.", "I agree with this statement. There is underlying issues here and resentment over having to care for their little sibling. Where are the parents in this situation??", "Dear op, do consider what this person has said but here\u2019s a different view. Traveling 4 hours to college lectures is not ideal, in any way shape or form, what op is doing is trying to find her sister a home so she doesn\u2019t have to travel 4 hours. Imagine the sister gets a job, that gap between work and college is going to be difficult to manage right off bat starting college. I thought that was a nice responsible thing to do for family. The questions being asked in the other comment above really confused me, because the answer was quite simple, as I stated before the travel time from home (currently) to college is not ideal for study and any social life, as most of their day and life will be traveling back and from college!!, if op now takes away the opportunity for a home close to her education she will be forced to have that segment of her life taken out. And once you realise that\u2019s you every day for a few years it can cause more mental drain than expected. \n\nShe\u2019s 19 exactly, she\u2019s confided in you before assuming you didn\u2019t press it out of her, however her meeting up with someone wasn\u2019t the issue, you presumed it was a boyfriend wasn\u2019t an issue. In all honesty I think it was the safest thought path. You assumed yes, you assumed, however you kept that to yourself because that wasn\u2019t your issue, it was the lie. \n\n\nBecause if we consider the reality of the situation who wouldn\u2019t ideally want a home closer to college, if you\u2019re really missing the planned date and time you set up with your sister to help look at homes to YOUR liking, there has to be a REAL special someone\u2026right?!! \n\n\nAll imma say is, have a sit down with your therapist and do really ask yourself why it was so much of an impact to you. And I do also say stop searching for her, it an amazing gesture you helping her out but she needs to figure that out on your own"]}
