From housing to college tuition to miscellaneous expenses, I bear them all.\n\nShe recently got admitted in a college that's far off from our house. It takes her 4 hours of travelling by public transport daily to commute to and from the college. \n\nI decided to find a place for her near college (she won't live on campus because the quality isn't good).

I've been spending hours finding a \"nice\" home for her. \n\nMy sister is always open to me about relationships etc. But today, she lied to me about visiting a friend (really elaborate lies) and instead went to see someone else.

Why do you feel that's any of your business? Do you really feel that she, as a fellow **adult**, is not privy/entitled to privacy, regarding her personal life? I'm just trying to understand your line of thinking.\n\nRegardless of the INFO, YWBTA. She's 19. An **adult**. She's allowed to have a relationship with someone. And she's allowed to keep that relationship private, if she chooses to. And, she's allowed to go wherever she pleases. It really does sound like she probably lied to you about where she was going because she thinks you're overbearing and controlling. Maybe perhaps in the past, she's opened up to you about a relationship, and maybe perhaps you didn't like the person she was seeing, so you held something she relied on you for (perhaps college money) over her head (\"you can date them, but I won't be paying for your education anymore\"), because honestly,  just reading your *post*, I could imagine you as being the type to do that. Sure, it's an assumption of you based off limited info, but food for thought, regardless. \n\nIf you have a history of \"hurt feelings\" when she doesn't do what **you want**, or tell you what you *feel* entitled to know, I could totally see why she'd lie to you and never share things with you again.\n\nHonestly, your AITA comes off as controlling, petty, entitled, and overbearing.\n\nYou said you \"believe\" it's a guy she's dating that she went to see, which leads *me* to believe that you may have no proof that she went to see this guy; that you're *assuming* she went to see him. If that's the case, you're double the asshole. Even if you did have proof she was seeing him, it's none of your business, and she has the right to keep her dating life private, if she wants.\n\nSure, you're allowed to cease house-hunting with her. You're allowed to do whatever you wish, regarding supporting her.

You are still young and should enjoy your life too and not be burdened with taking care of your sister. She is 19, she can also do house hunting.

HOUSEHOLD. \nYTA.\nBecause you're punishing her for her acting as if she has to protect herself. \nWhich tells me that you're probably not even remotely aware that the abuse most likely intensified for her in ways you can't imagine after you moved out. Something tells me that your parents may have played on her fears as a younger teenager to plant deep seeds of mistrust. I wouldn't be surprised if she literally has zero trust in anyone or anything. \nDid you think your parents only did it to you? Did you think that yours is the only experience that counts?

Did you move her out with you or leave her behind and just try to step in when you knew about something?\nYou're looking at this from a very one sided perspective. It's not all about you. Stop making it personal. \nAs a former foster parent, I'd have the strong thoughts of \"oh, jeez. These kids need therapy. Hmm. How can I bring it up without stepping on toes now that they are adults?\". (My wife would just give me that look, roll her eyes at me, then turn to y'all and say \"that's messed up. You need to talk to someone. I know a couple of resources if you'd like. You hungry?\" and proceed to offer you the contact information while mothering you silly. Tends to be why our house still sees our grown fosters underfoot all the time. )\nI'm not deliberately being harsh. But in my experience,  abuse survivors tend to have tunnel vision and don't realize they themselves have behaviors that are bordering on abusive in their relationships. Because it's what they were taught. Breaking that is hard. So, yeah, therapy. \nGive yourself grace. Realize that you're still healing. Your sister has to heal too. If you want to have a healthy relationship with her, thus means you're probably going to have to sit her down and talk to her about it. Which she may be uncomfortable with. Doesn't have to be a huge production. Can be short, like \"hey, shit went down when we were growing up. It messed me up. It messed you up. I get things can be weird. I get you might not trust me a lot. I want us to be good. And I know it's going to take time. Just wanted to say I realize this and that it's ok. Let's just take each day and figure it out. Maybe go talk to someone. But let's try to build something good,  yeah?\". Because she's probably not aware she's doing it, either. \nThink of it this way: you both got burned. You got brand A burn cream. She got brand b burn cream.  Neither burn cream was wrong,  even though you may not like brand b.

You said she's a good kis and supportive at home - that's setting her up for failure.\n\nYou should accompany her for ONE DAY and ride with her 2 hrs each way and see if you could handle that.\n\nHowever - all of this said - you're not her parent. Where are your parents in this situation? I love my sister but I wouldn't buy a house based off my siblings proximity to school. You'd be accountable for that house long after she potentially graduates. It is something I'd do - Maybe for my child.\n\nIt's assholish if you already promise this and change your mind over her \"having a bf\". It's not assholish to set a boundary and say, \"I cannot fund this \" etc", "Time for a heart to heart talk. Get all the facts. tell her how you feel. Then talk some more. Sort it out and don't let ot fester.", "Agreed. It sounds like OP has taken on more of a parental role in her sister's life and expects the sister to tell her everything. That's just not fair or realistic. The sister is a young woman, and should be able to keep some parts of her life private until she is ready to share them.", "> Wanting sister level clearance while having mom level authority is a pipe dream\n\nGreat way to put it honestly. It\u2019s the same as being a parent and wanting to be your child\u2019s friend. It\u2019s hard to be both.\n\nYou\u2019re an incredible sister/mom OP. Because of you, and your efforts, and all of your sacrifices your sister will have a good life! Be proud! \n\nThen decide when you\u2019re done raising her, and be her sister again.", "I agree with this statement. There is underlying issues here and resentment over having to care for their little sibling. Where are the parents in this situation??", "Dear op, do consider what this person has said but here\u2019s a different view. Traveling 4 hours to college lectures is not ideal, in any way shape or form, what op is doing is trying to find her sister a home so she doesn\u2019t have to travel 4 hours. Imagine the sister gets a job, that gap between work and college is going to be difficult to manage right off bat starting college. I thought that was a nice responsible thing to do for family. The questions being asked in the other comment above really confused me, because the answer was quite simple, as I stated before the travel time from home (currently) to college is not ideal for study and any social life, as most of their day and life will be traveling back and from college!!, if op now takes away the opportunity for a home close to her education she will be forced to have that segment of her life taken out. And once you realise that\u2019s you every day for a few years it can cause more mental drain than expected. \n\nShe\u2019s 19 exactly, she\u2019s confided in you before assuming you didn\u2019t press it out of her, however her meeting up with someone wasn\u2019t the issue, you presumed it was a boyfriend wasn\u2019t an issue. In all honesty I think it was the safest thought path. You assumed yes, you assumed, however you kept that to yourself because that wasn\u2019t your issue, it was the lie. \n\n\nBecause if we consider the reality of the situation who wouldn\u2019t ideally want a home closer to college, if you\u2019re really missing the planned date and time you set up with your sister to help look at homes to YOUR liking, there has to be a REAL special someone\u2026right?!! \n\n\nAll imma say is, have a sit down with your therapist and do really ask yourself why it was so much of an impact to you. And I do also say stop searching for her, it an amazing gesture you helping her out but she needs to figure that out on your own", "YTA - To tell it flatly, this is actually controlling and abusive behavior. I think you don't intend to, but it is what it is.\n\nYou are trying to do best and help her a lot. u are 23 and helping your sister a lot. You are from abusive environment getting away and helping siste to get away. She is entitled to privacy.\n\nBut, you can't punish for not being told something like that. It is not personal insult to not be told everything, it is just normal human behavior.", "NTA - your sister is a growing up and there are certain adult responsibilities that she is old enough to take over. Looking for her own housing  is a part of it. Transporting herself to school is another. You are an empathic and considerate person because you are trying to make your life as easy as possible for your sister, but that won't necessarily help her. You should focus on providing SOME support so that you give room for her to have agency. To make mistakes. To succeed or fail without you. This is how you grow up. In the meantime, you don't have to spread yourself so thin. Your sister sounds well adjusted enough that you can step back and focus on yourself and on your journey. This will ease those feelings of resentment you feel from sacrificing yourself so much. It is time to learn to be a sister and not a parent. \n\nWho knows why she didn't tell you about what she is doing. I didn't tell my parents about my relationships for several reasons such as:\n- It wasn't evolved enough to label\n- It was just for fun\n- I liked the guy but was embarrassed by his behavior \n- I liked the guy and didn't want to jinx it until it was more certain \n\nGive yourself some room to focus on your self-care OP.", "I think you're setting an unhealthy dynamic. Your sister is a young adult and you're also a young adult. You shouldn't be doing everything thing for her. You say you pay for her college , room, food and other things. This doesn't allow your sister to grow and may lead to resentment on your part. I'm not saying that don't help your sister, but do it without burdening yourself or spoonfeeding her. You are her sister, not her parent.", "Info: is there a reason she may have felt compelled to lie? Maybe from childhood trauma, or something that happened between the two of you? If she had told the truth upfront, do you think you would've been bothered that she was spending this time with a romantic potential partner?", ">It\u2019s hard without parents to guide you but at least we have google now! ;-)\n\nAnd kind people like yourself on the internet! \n\nThanks so much for this thoughtful answer. It's really difficult to stop myself from helping, but you're so right, I need to let her figure things out on her own.", "As long as you\u2019re in a place where you need to have mom-level authority, no, you cannot have both. It\u2019s not forever though.", "It's perfectly fine to not house hunt for her. You're doing her a favour by doing it in the first place and if you objectively don't want to, you shouldn't. But not doing her this favour for this specific reason, this behaviour that ultimately doesn't personally affect you in a significant way, you're putting conditions on your relationship with your sister that affect her privacy, agency and independence. Making your help conditional and using it as a tool to 'punish' her for undesirable behaviour is a problem.", "I don't have an answer to whether you are TA because it's not black or white, but can I just honestly say that I am proud of you and what you are doing for you and your sister. Managing to get out of an abusive household while also protecting your sister is not easy. \n\nI also come from a very messed up upbringing on many different levels and at almost 30 I'm still in the process of figuring out what is normal behaviour and what is actually toxic. Our perception of reality and relationships is warped because of what horrible people did to us and that's all we knew. It's noticing the little things that are the real eye openers. Based on your responses, you really sound like you are doing everything you can to break the cycle of abuse and actually reflect and learn how to do/be better. Accepting that things are wrong and can change is a really big step, alongside admitting to our faults or mistakes. You are only 23 and are already a mother to your sister and have been amazing in supporting her in every way you can. Even if you guys are close, don't forget she also went through what you went through and maybe is processing things differently (she obviously doesn't have the burden of supporting another person like you do). Her idea of a \"parent\" - which you have taken on - might be attached to resentment. \n\nYou are doing great. Others here are saying you sound controlling, which might even be the case, but it's very obvious you are just trying to protect her and/or have been forced to be controlling to keep you both safe and healthy. Don't be so hard on yourself. Just talk openly to your sister and let her know how you feel, while also letting her know that you are in the process of growing and changing and will accept what she says. Sibling relationships from abuse households are very sensitive and you don't want to hurt what you guys have, because honestly it's a blessing. \n\nSorry for my wall of text. I just wanted to say you are doing great. Keep being aware and being better <3", "Hi OP! I'm in my 40s and just stumbled across a whole new box of toxic behaviors that I hated about my dad and stepfamily but now realize I was doing in my own way and need to unlearn. It's exhausting! I try to be gentle with myself and not feel guilty about what I was taught, AND to take responsibility for what I practice doing differently going forward.", "Her \"friend\" might be a girlfriend. You are doing more than great with your sister, but back off. You two want to be in eachothers life. NTA, but don't become one, even though you mean well \ud83d\ude18", ">But the phone went unanswered, and since I know her friend, I called her.\n\nTo be honest, this is a bit controlling. Not sure that's the right word, but if I was hanging out with a friend and my mom called that friend because I didn't answer the phone *once*, and it wasn't an absolute emergency, I'd definitely feel like a boundary was crossed. And that's if my mom did that, while you're her sister, which might make a difference.", "Shucks, thank you! \ud83d\ude0a It certainly is difficult! Don\u2019t beat yourself up too much and don\u2019t feel like you have to stop helping altogether. I\u2019d say let her take the lead from here. You\u2019re doing really great already and this internet stranger is in your corner! Take care and have a great rest of your day!", "Yeah this is it. The comments all scolding you that your sister is an adult and you have no right to feel this way while at the same not batting a lid that this \"independent adult\" is being supported by you who is merely 4 years older. You are young, you are allowed to enjoy your 20s as a carefree person. \n\nNAH coz your sister didn't ask you to do all that for her and hence might not even realize what sacrifices you have to make, the stress you go through. You NA coz when you do so much for someone, it's only natural to get upset when you realize they don't think of you the same way that you do of them. I'm sure she loves you, but probably not in the besties-share-everything kinda way. As long as you dont lash out at her, it's fine. Experience the emotion, process it, learn from it and course correct. You seem to be very open to it which is so admirable. Like you said, talk to your therapist. Definitely take a step back from doing so much for your sister because you might just end up resenting her later or holding it over her. At 19,you learned to take care of yourself, I'm sure she can do the same for herself too.\n\nEase back, live a little, let her find her own path to being an adult, all the ups and downs of it, you find yours as well. The two of you can be there for each other without you becoming Atlas. That's an imbalance in the relationship dynamic and for two adults, not a healthy one", "Bing Bing bing", "YTA you dont even know if she lied you just assume she did", "Plenty of us came from humble beginnings and we didn't get someone to buy/rent a house for us and dog sit while we go to class? Dorms aren't 'quality?' I think your desire to help has twisted priorities here. Being in dorms will help your sister make perhaps lifelong student friends and be in study groups and have time for clubs and socialising. If she really needs her own house let her find it. Why are you doing this legwork while she goes to visit boyfriends? I know its hard (I'm a mom who sometimes hovers too much) but its best for her if you are a rock from your own house but let her go forth and stand on her own. NTA", "You're in a transition zone; she's 19 and needs to start taking a more proactive role in her own life, and you need to start learning how to step back. Like she should be participating in her own housing search. But she is inexperienced enough that you should help her review the potential places she finds and teach her what red flags to avoid. You two do need to establish a safety baseline, like maybe a text by midnight if she'll be staying somewhere else; but she is plenty old enough to have privacy in who she sees. Basically try to start figuring out what a healthy sister relationship would look like when she's a fully independent adult, and let her know that you want to start working towards that.", "Why are you being downvoted? You are basically just the same thing as the replies above you, so I don't get it??", "How do we know that it is a boy?", ">Her idea of a \"parent\" - which you have taken on - might be attached to resentment. \n\nI'm sometimes honestly in awe of insights like this. This never occurred to me and makes so much sense. We both love each other and have been there, but yes, she might have some unresolved feelings too. \n\nAlso, thank you so much. Your words mean so much to me, genuinely. I've saved your response, will keep coming back to it when I feel low. Thanks again! :)", "That was my though too", "I think you\u2019re fab. I even gave you my free award because I think you\u2019re doing a great thing and your openness to people\u2019s responses is wonderful. \n\nYou do you.

Contacting her friend multiple times just to get an opinion on her house seems a little excessive. I don\u2019t think that you should have to prod around asking for where your sister is and it probably comes off as a little controlling and overbearing. From a household where my family was like that, that just made me pull away more, so I would suggest just trying to let her breathe a little and give her your trust. \n\nI think something that might help is for you to go out and do more things for yourself as well. You said you do everything for your sister and in a comment talked about how you might hold resentment since she gets to feel the freedom at her age that you never did. We\u2019re (you and me) about the same age and I think it\u2019s important to know that you are still soooo young and you can allow yourself to do fun things for yourself. Take yourself on self-dates, do something you\u2019ve thought about doing for a while that you haven\u2019t. Being raised in a controlling household has the drawback where I also want to act that way bc it\u2019s what\u2019s familiar to me, and it\u2019s easier to hover when you\u2019re not doing anything for yourself to distract yourself if that makes sense.", "You also need to remember that she is growing into an adult. You need to start letting her make her own choice and be responsible for herself.\n\nFor example, she needs to be just as invested as you are in moving. Does she actually want to move? Is she so used to you doing everything she doesn\u2019t think she NEEDS to take an active role? Is she nervous and self sabotaging (which wouldn\u2019t be unusual for a 19 year old)?\n\nTalk to her and make sure she is still on board with your plans.", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult.

NTA, however trust is a huge issue. This is something to talk to your sister about. Your home/relationship needs to be a no judgement zone. I am the mom of two young adults and one teen and they need me to tell them less and listen more now that they are older. What you need from her is what she needs from you (emotionally). Good luck."]}
