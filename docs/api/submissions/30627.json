You aren't just exaggerating?", "NTA but omg\ud83d\ude2d getting mad about not having 3 pickles is such a mood, yall both sound so great- i cant blame him for the love of restaurant pickles, they definitely hit different. Its a silly thing to get mad over- if he was just UPSET i dont blame him but full on mad is crazy lol.

Was this really so impactful on your life you need affirmation from internet strangers on your choices?

He was told they don't have the supply for extra pickles and you give him yours, guaranteeing it will be plated with the extra pickle that the restaurant can't give him...and that's a problem? lol!\n\nThe restaurant sounds like it was being firm about no extras, so he wouldn't have gotten that 3rd pickle anyway, so again - what's the problem?", "Esh\n\n I do agree a pickle would be a ridiculous thing to argue about.  But I don't think it's about the pickle.  I think it's about you inserting yourself into his request and dismissing it.   The restaurant and waitress are well equipped to manage the needs of the other diners.  She could have just said no without your help.  Or she could have given him an extra pickle and he could have tipped her in thanks.  \n\n\nOn the other hand, if it really was about the pickle and he kept pouting about it.  I'd just say I'm sorry your dinner was ruined without the 3-1 pickle hamburger ratio.  And then, when the food arrived,  id eat my pickle without a second thought.", "NTA. He asked for an extra pickle, the waitress mentioned that might not have been possible. If anything you did something good by intervening and offering him your pickle so he couldn't bother the waitress (who was likely busy) again.\n\nAlso I'm kinda annoyed by the fact that his 3 pickles comment implies he already assumed he would just get your pickle too without having asked you beforehand.", "Tell him if he's a good widdle boy and finishes his food then you'll buy him a Whole Big Boy jar of pickles of His Very Own!", "I'm sorry that your lunch turned into a pickle of a situation. You were just being sweet and considerate by offering your pickle to your husband, not knowing the impact it would have on his preferred pickle to burger ratio. It's totally okay to want to share and be kind to others, but sometimes these small things, like pickles, can mean a lot to someone. Maybe next time, you can check in with your husband about the pickle exchange to ensure everyone's got their perfect pickle ratio!", "NTA he\u2019ll survive with two pickles", "Yes. Worst person ever.", "YTA.", "Going against the popular opinion but kinda YTA, it\u2019s not up to you who decides. You made the decision for the waitress. If she can spare an extra pickle for him then good for him, if not, then that\u2019s it. You didn\u2019t need to speak up at all and take away the possibility of the pickle.", "Definitely, YTA. Is your husband a child that you are able to deny him what he wants to eat? Also, what difference is it to you about what supplies the the restaurant is running low on? That's their problem, not your husband's fault. If you haven't already, you need to apologize to your husband. His is not a child and you are not his mother.", "Eh, I'd say a soft YTA. You turned a low chance of your husband getting the extra pickle  that he wanted (plus yours was always a given) to a 0% chance just because you thought to be more considerate to the waitress and the other diners than to your own husband. The waitress can handle the lightest awkward interaction of her life and your husband isn't hogging insulin from other people, it's a pickle. This whole thing is extremely unimportant but at it's core it was you being more considerate of others than to your own husband.", "YTA. Your interference was unnecessary when you could have just let the waitress actually confirm there would be an issue. There might be a food order being delivered that afternoon she doesn't know about and an extra pickle is fine. Or they were rationing pickles on her shift yesterday but had a delivery before her shift started and forgot to tell her. If she comes back with a no, that is fine but let her check. The bar can send someone to the grocery store to tide them over if they completely run out. It is not ideal for their bottom line but neither is letting pickles get so low  before ordering more.", "YTA / NAH. \n\nIf he wanted your pickle he would\u2019ve asked you, not the waitress. He was intentional with his actions and you assumed you knew his intent (when in actuality he was planning on having his preferred amount of pickles, 3). \n\nBut now that you\u2019ve learned his favorite ratio of pickles to hamburgers (congrats on the milestone in your marriage) - you both can now be happy moving forward! \n\nHe also could\u2019ve told you of his preferred ratio prior to this, which is why I\u2019m also leaning towards NAH. \n\nHooray for communication.", "Your husband is the inconsiderate asshole", "Light YTA. Only because I\u2019m biased and share the same pickle to burger ratio as your husband. \u2014what kind of joint runs out of pickles?", "INFO: how did he express his anger?", "Are you thinking about leaving him?  If he gets mad at that do you feel safe?", "Is this really post-worthy? It's a pickle.", "ESH\n\nYou, because a bar running out of pickles is just ridiculous and it's not your problem.\n\nYour husband for throwing a tantrum like a child.\n\nThe waitress, because why should she give all that information about 'running low', for goodness sake?", "My god how could you come between a man and his three pickles...you are a monster lol. I feel like this isn't even an AITA situation this is more like one of those adorable husband wife moments you'd see in a romcom or something, the man wanted 3 pickles but you foiled his plan and now he's gotta settle for 2 pickles yet you guys are both still going to leave the place happy, even if he didn't get his 3rd pickle. Nobody is an asshole in this situation.", "How difficult is it for someone to run to the store and buy some pickles?\n\nStocking issues are not your problem. \n\nSaying that, no idea why he couldn\u2019t have just taken the pickles you weren\u2019t going to eat if he wanted them so bad.\n\nNAH", "Info\n\n>My husband got mad\n\nHow?", "Yta.
