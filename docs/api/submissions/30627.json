Extra pickles!!", "NTA\u2026..So if your husband gets an extra pickle it\u2019s three but if you give him your pickle it\u2019s only two?????? I\u2019m not understanding how that works out but okay. Also, you shouldn\u2019t even have to post this to ask. Whoever is in charge of the pickles is the AH for not making sure there were enough pickles. And why is your husband tripping out about not having his perfect pickle ratio? I understand preferences but that seems to be on a whole other level\u2026.", "YTA: Let the restaurant sort out how they want to deal with a third-pickle request. In situations like these, I believe a unified public-facing front is best. It drives me up the wall when my partner does stuff similar to your equitable pickle stunt. \n\nThat being said, hopefully your husband would have been sensitive of other diners' pickle needs once he heard the restaurant was running low on pickles. I.e., \\*he\\* says \"That's fine.\" \n\nThe real asshole: the restaurant for not having a sufficient number of pickles. COME ON!", "NTA. If he\u2019s mad over not getting extra pickles, I\u2019d be worried about how he reacts when something more serious happens.\n\nEdit to add: He could\u2019ve insisted on getting extra pickles from the waitress, whether you said he can have yours or not. This is the most passive aggressive ish I\u2019ve seen.", "It would have been be worse had your husband offered his pickle to the waitress.", "So he normally gets an extra pickle from them *and* yours then? Otherwise, I can't see how it matters whether the extra comes from the kitchen or from you.\n\nEither way, NTA. I love pickles too, but I think you were very considerate to think of other diners.", "Ion even know what i just fucking read", "In your shoes I would help my spouse get as many pickles as she wants and let the chips fall where they may with respect to the other customers.

Be more considerate of the person you are spending time with, not worried about hypothetical other guests and their pickles. He asked for it, let it be. You basically told him \u201cno, you can\u2019t have that pickle\u201d\u2026..don\u2019t do this to people. The waitress could\u2019ve made that decision. Pickles may not have been as important to anyone else, but even so, it\u2019s your husband.

If you\u2019re both regulars, go ahead and ask for a third pickle!  It\u2019s ok, they would rather some regulars be happy NOW than potential customers later get a pickle they potentially want.  Plus there\u2019s plenty of time between now and later to get a new jar of pickles- they\u2019re low quantity isn\u2019t your concern.  Whether or not they charge you for the extra pickles should be your only concern.", "NAH \nAs a pickle lover, I understand his unrelenting torment.
