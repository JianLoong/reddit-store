I agreed.\n\nAfter the birth, they moved to a different country and our contact decreased. The last time we met was over 5 years ago and towards the end we only exchanged messages maybe once or twice a year.\n\nMore recently, Eric and Emi were in a brutal accident. Eric passed away and Emi is on life support. I received word only when I was contacted to see if I could take their 2 children, Jo (17F) and Mo (13M). In their affairs, it mentioned to contact me about the kids as the next-in-line guardian.\n\nIt was news to me that I was listed as a guardian to Mo. I don't have much of a relationship with Mo. They never asked me to be Mo's godfather and never said a word when I would send gifts to Jo for her birthday but not Mo. I always assumed Mo had a separate godparent.\n\nI made arrangements to go see the kids. Jo has memories of me but the last time I saw Mo, he was 6. The kids are currently staying with relatives but the relatives can't take them permanently.\n\nMy wife and I are child free though more because of our lifestyle rather than a dislike of kids.My wife isn't too put out at the idea of Jo living with us since Jo is nearly an adult but wife is not interested in being any kind of adult figure to Mo. I travel a great deal for work and don't have time to watch over a young teen.\n\nIf I don't take them, they will be deported from where they are. Jo may be able to have herself declared an adult in the home country. But then she's on her own. Having spoken to her, I know she's terrified of the idea.\n\nI've offered to take Jo for the remainder of her high school and put her through college. Jo is currently thinking it over. The case officer suggested it would be best if the siblings were kept together but I told them I can only take Jo.\n\nI was talking to a friend about all this and she said it was kind of an AH move to take one kid but not the other.\n\nAITA? I hate the idea of fulfilling the technicality and not the spirit but I don't have the time and I feel like it would be better to do what I can than half-ass things.\n\n**Extra info**\n\nJo and Mo are on a visa where they currently live. They're kind of in legal limbo at the moment since their mother is technically alive. Emi requires full time care and I'm still working out how long they can afford to do so but safe to say maybe 3 years tops if they don't end life support. If they pull support early, they save money they would badly need but would likely get deported within a couple of months.\n\nHowever, I'm a citizen of that country. If I adopt Jo, at least she can finish out high school where she is.\n\n**More Info**\n\nTo everyone saying Jo can adopt Mo at 18, courts aren't just going to approve an adoption. Jo would have to show that she can handle the responsibility of a minor by herself, and if she can't, Mo remains in the system.\n\nTo everyone else saying just provide money, it's not that simple. Mo is young enough that the courts will insist that he either have a legal guardian or become a ward of the state. In the case of  a legal guardian, the money would be made accessible to them. In this case, there are relatives and there's a reason why the parents didn't want the relatives taking them in.\n\nIf I knowingly circumvent the guardians to put money directly in Mo's hands, I assume a degree of legal responsibility. If I had time to actually parent Mo, not a big deal, but I don't have that time.", "created_utc": 1682521436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zk7c3/aita_for_only_only_offering_to_adopt_1_of_2/", "score": 306, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids should not be split up.", "NAH. No one should ever take a person that they can't treat with love and care.  But separating them by a country when grieving so hard is heartless.  It is literally best to be kept together and you would be ignoring expert opinion.   Deported could mean a country the youngest doesn't even know the language of.\n\n  Take both or take neither.  14 isn't that far away and at 18, 19 the oldest may be able to take the 14 year old.  the 17 year should have a voice.", "Wow, this is an incredibly unfortunate and unfair situation exacerbated by visa issues. I feel really bad for Jo and Mo.", "YTA. You're not the ah for not being willing to adopt more than one kid. It's a big undertaking and there are very few situations where someone would be an AH for declining to adopt someone else's kid. But that being said, you can't really think it's reasonable to split up siblings when their family has fallen apart in tragedy. Particularly leaving the younger kid behind is introducing a whole new trauma to already traumatic events. Plus, you're putting an impossible choice on a grieving teenager. So you're perfectly fine for not wanting to take both kids, but you should have had the forethought to know not to make an offer that splits them up.", "Yta so its better for 1 kid to be deported???  At least they'd be together. \n\nCan you not take both, with the understanding that Jo will be adopting her sibling at 18?  If you can help her through college then surely she can do part time and stay with her sibling.  Mo is 13, not 3.", "YTA!

If you don't feel you can take on the situation, then you probably shouldn't. Personally, I'm surprised that the oldest would be willing to come without her sibling. I hope this works out well for everyone eventually.", "Info: why does no one care about what happens to Mo? You go on about jo, but fuck mo because he\u2019s a few years younger? I just don\u2019t get it, he\u2019s not a baby, he\u2019s 13. Why break up grieving siblings and basically telling Jo after losing her parents to choose between staying with her brother or staying with you and abandoning him? That\u2019s a really unfair thing to put on a kid that\u2019s just lost their parents, sorry not lost both but losing one and watching the other die. I can\u2019t even imagine being godparent to one sibling and then completely ignoring the other just because you weren\u2019t asked to be godparent. Boggles the mind. \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to take either of them but to break them up like that over such shitty excuses would make you an Ah. My heart breaks for Mo, the kid no one wants purely because he\u2019s a few years younger. Jo gets to stay in school and have her college paid for and Mo not only gets deported but thrown through the system to a life of foster care. You\u2019re kinda half assing it already, you say you guys have no interest in being any form of adult figure in Mo\u2019s life but you do know you have to be an adult figure for Jo? She\u2019s only 17, she\u2019s still a minor who\u2019s losing both parents. It isn\u2019t going to be a case of just letting her stay with you, she\u2019s going to need help advice and guidance throughout her life and will fall back on you as the only adult figures she has around. She\u2019s going to be traumatised from everything that\u2019s going on and if you took only her she\u2019ll be dealing with the guilt of not knowing where her brother is. It\u2019s not going to be a walk in the park. \n\nWhy not, if you can afford it, provide money for both kid\u2019s education and money for Jo if she took on guardianship and take neither? That way you help with a safety net without splitting them.", "YTA, these kids have just lost their parents, you can't ask them to lose each other too.", "YTA. \n\nThere is a lot of tragic stuff going on right now. They just lost two parents. And your thought is lets make them loose each other. Siblings of 13 years. It would be one thing if these were babies. Still horrible to separate but they wouldn't know. These are fully aware Teens... These two will need each other as they mourn the loss of their parents... Why would you want to throw even more of a wrench into there already wrecked world...", "YTA. You take both or you take none. Separating two grieving children will cause them immense amounts of trauma. Life altering. Do not under any circumstances force two children who have lost their entire world to be ripped apart from the only thing they have left.", "YTA for separating bereaved orphaned siblings and it's a little scary that you need to be told that.", "I would advise you not to take the eldest unless you take both. They just lost their parents. It seems cruel that they should be taken from each other as well. These kids have just had the rug ripped out from under them and they probably need one another. Maybe think about taking both on a trial basis. At least give Jo a little time to get her life together in case she needs to take custody of Mo.", "Soft YTA it could've also happened at a time that Jo was minor. Then you would also have abandoned her? Or still just Mo?", "What country deports minor children?", "It\u2019s not two choices here but three! You would not be the asshole for refusing to take them together, that\u2019s a financial and emotional burden that you explained you are not able to do, but you would be the asshole for taking only one of them and leaving the other in limbo. The third choice is taking neither.", "YWBTA - It should be a package deal for the kid's sake.  If you just can't take both, you should take neither.", "If the kids can stay together they should. I\u2019m conflicted on AH status here. But you should be Jo\u2019s last option, not her first.", "YWBTA. These kids lost their parents, why would you want them to lose each other too?", "YWBTA\n\nDefinitely both or none. \n\nBut explore your options. \n\nPerhaps you can have Jo declared Mo's legal guardian and you support HER in the role. They don't live with you but you help with all logistics etc.", "idk man. i'm on the fence. the one thing that really stood out to me was the fact that you said \"i would send gifts to Jo for her birthday but not Mo.\" and \"...not interested in being any kind of adult figure to Mo.\" it honestly sounds like you just don't like or don't care about one of the children. you're fine with taking Jo \"because she's almost an adult\" and you'd be fine with sending her through college but taking in Mo would be crossing a line for you? I'd try to help contact other family or friends to see if they could take them both in because they do not need to be separated. also, you mentioned that you spoke to Jo and know she's terrified of being declared a legal adult at 17 (rightfully so) but you don't seem to care or acknowledge Mo's imminent struggles as a young teen boy. it screams choosing favorites to me. you do not need to take either of them in if you can't take both. support from a distance and be involved in their lives if you want to.\nEDIT TO ADD - i'm only on the fence because i do personally think you're a soft AH, but, you have no real obligations to the children. they aren't your children nor are they your actual blood relatives. you didn't even know you were listed as a guardian so you don't HAVE to do anything.", "NAH. Also what does Jo want? You say that if you adopt her she can stay where she is to finish school. Is it possible that she would be willing to \u201craise\u201d her brother if you adopt him as well. I know she deserves to have a childhood and not worry about a kid but if she wants to that is different. Then maybe you could just be financially responsible for him and not responsible for raising him.", "NTA The objective truth is, the parents are for NOT DISCUSSING THIS WITH THE PERSON THEY LISTED AS GUARDIAN! Adoption is a HUGE change, not a small favor or small inconvenience. You had ZERO warning. Nobody can ask you to completely reformat your and your partner's lives because someone listed you as a guardian without your knowledge. Anybody saying it's cruel not to adopt both is free to volunteer to adopt both, including the Y T A-ers in this post. There is no argument that can be made that you have more moral obligation to do this than anyone replying to this post does.", "Ywbta\n\nYou said they have relatives here right? Cant you arrange with them so you can take mo\u2019s guard but she stays most of the time with her relatives?", "NAH - I understand the dilemma but the right thing to do is to try to take both kids. Or find a different way to help them. But please don\u2019t cause more trauma to already suffering children. But your kindness to even consider helping Jo is already wonderful.\n\nAlso remember that Jo may be willing to take responsibility for her brother in the absence of hands on parenting from you and your wife.", "What happens if you take neither of them? Are they going to end up together? \n\nAll these comments seen to think if you don't take them both, they'll magically end up together in another country. Where is this coming from? Do they have ties there? \n\nI'm not going to call you an asshole for only being able to take care of one kid. Who is going to take care of the 13 year old? Jo? You're traveling, your wife isn't interested....so? NAH.", "YWBTA yeah. Take them both or not at all.", "YWBTA 100% \n\nIf you can\u2019t take both (which can be understandable) then don\u2019t take either. \n\nBoth children just went through something traumatic, but Mo is also at that age where it could seriously impact them in the long run if they are separated from the only family they really have aka they\u2019re sister.", "YWBTA\n\nI agree with other commenters. It\u2019s all or nothing. \n\nI fear for what will happen if you don\u2019t take them honestly but you do have the right to say no. \n\n17 and 13? At bare minimum you would be committed for 5 years until the younger is 18. Their situation is very fluid  and fragile right now..you could be that structure until they are old enough or until the other relatives are able to figure things out. \n\nIdk. It\u2019s tough if you empathize with what will happen to the kids. Don\u2019t separate them if you can\u2019t do both. They need to be together to grieve.", "I mean hoenstly Mo is still better off with his sister in a home where one guardian doesn't have time for him and the other who doesn't want him that much than in an orphanage.\nSo you'd still do him a favor.\nPlease take him in.", "NTA too many parents don\u2019t bother to have plans with willing parties for their children in the event that they themselves pass away. Parents pass away all the time. There needs to be a plan beyond \u201coh I\u2019m sure *someone* will take on this massive responsibility. That\u2019s that.\u201d I feel really badly for the children. On top of grief, not knowing what\u2019ll happen to them next. I think it\u2019s best that the children aren\u2019t separated. I hope that happens for them.", "Try to take them both. I know it's a huge undertaking, and no you would not be the A if you didn't, because if you can't, well, you can't... But it's the opportunity to make a huge difference in both children's lives. It's the opportunity to be a really good man, and these opportunities don't come often in a life.\n\nIt might happen to me soon. For complicated reasons I might have to take care of a thirteen years old if my best friend dies. Hopefully she will rally and this won't happen! \n\nNo judgment, I think it's a very complicated matter, but you can make a difference here.", "NAH. You shouldn't take in a child you have doubts about raising, it probably won't end well.\n\nYou talk about them being deported though. You talk about being able to stop Jo being deported and finishing school where she is. You talk about supporting Jo. All of that is lovely. But it feels icky that you don't seem to care that *Mo* will be *deported*. That *Mo* won't be able to finish school where he is. It feels like you are a hand reaching down from on high saying \"this one is worthy\".\n\nI think my ick factor is that, while they're both probably minors, one is significantly more at risk, and that's the one who is *definitely* going to be abandoned. \n\nYou're not the AH if you only take in Jo, but I think, ethically, it's both or neither as far as fostering/sponsoring/adoption goes. Would you be willing to offer Jo financial (or any other) support *without* adopting her?", "NAH\n\nIt's usually best to keep siblings together but you know your situation best.\n\nThis is way above reddit's pay grade though.\n\nWorry less about being an asshole and more about honoring your own conscience right now.", "YTA. You don't get to pick and choose what children you want like yiu are shopping for candy.", "NAH but the right thing to do is take both of them.  But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a moral obligation since you never agreed to it, so not doing it doesn\u2019t make you TA.  Their parents should definitely have spoken with you about being their guardian.  You might consider taking them both temporarily while something more permanent can be figured out - that would seem to be reasonable if that\u2019s an option - and you might consider trying to find other family or friends to help.\n\nIf it were me though, I\u2019d take them both.  Even if not what I originally planned for or wanted it\u2019s the right thing to do, and the rewards for you could be great as well.  I know you don\u2019t feel that connection now but you might develop it.  Also, just the fact that you feel a connection with the older one and care about her should lead you to think about taking them both as separating them will be so much harder on her.  She has already lost her parents, and her sibling is all she has left of a life that was taken so suddenly from her.\n\nSo even if not morally required, I\u2019d strongly consider thinking about finding a place in your heart for them.", "NTA.\n\nYou can only offer a choice to Jo and let her know you can\u2019t take her sibling if she stays with you. Then anything she decides, will be up to her. \n\nBetter than taking a kid whom you don\u2019t want because raising kids come with financial and emotional responsibilities. You are not their blood relative and hold no obligations to them.", "I'm going to go with YTA for being so all or nothing with this. Why are you willing to put the oldest one through collage but not care for the youngest? Is possible to have them both for a year and then have the oldest take in their sibling? It would obviously still mean an economic burden for you, but maybe it's less jarring in concept for you and your wife?", "YTA- Take both in; life happens and yes it is unfortunate that you and your wife weren't consulted about being listed as secondary guardians but you losing your 'child-free lifestyle' is nothing compared to what these children are going through.", "YWBTA: all of nothing. They have already lost their parents, and now you want them to loose eachother? Have a THIRTEEN YEARS OLD KID DEPORTED? By themselves?

I can't imagine being in your position, but I know I would not separate those kids & I would find a way even if it meant sacrificing, to take them both.  YWBTA if you separate these kids or allow them to get deported.", "YTA, because you are forcing a 17-year-old who just lost her parents and is facing deportation and the loss of everything and everyone she knows to decide whether to accept staying with you and going to college here--but leaving her younger brother to be deported alone, away from everything and everyone he knows. That is a horrible position to put her in. If she chooses to stay, she could damage her relationship with him forever--and who knows if she'd be able to find him or get him back once she's an adult, or what might have happened to him? \n\nAlso, 13 is old enough to be home while you travel for work, especially if your wife is there, if not interested in doing parenting--she'd at least, I hope, make sure he doesn't accidentally burn the house down or throw a rager-- and Jo would be there too for the first year as well, and may be able to take him all or part time once she's an adult, or at least in just a few years. I would say it's not a good idea to take him in if you and your wife don't want to parent him/don't have time to devote to him-- but the alternative here is splitting up two siblings and sending one to another country, where it sounds like he hasn't lived for a long time if ever and doesn't have relatives, to be thrown into a foster system in a totally unfamiliar place...", "Soft YTA. Take both or none. Jo can help raise Mo and can get a job and hopefully move out at 18 and bring Mo. I\u2019ve had a friend who was 19 get legal custody of her 15yr old sister and they lived in a small 2 bedroom apartment. Please don\u2019t just take 1. It\u2019s incredibly cruel to separate them now and I would not want to live with that in my mind for years, especially if this gets bad for Mo you\u2019ll feel so much guilt.", "YTA, you do not split up siblings especially after a tragic event. Like how would you feel it this was done to you? Figure it out and make it work with both the kids or let them both go.", "This is a difficult one. \n\nMy question is....would you want to be separated if you were in this situation? \n\nYWBTA if you only took one, but on the flip side...you care enough to consider trying. So very difficult to make a judgement on you. Good luck with your decision.", "YTA \n\nYou essentially gave a teenager the choice to try save them selves from being deported or go with their younger sibling and face who knows what, when they are going through the toughest moment of their lives. \n\nWOW\n\nWhen you accepted to become godfather you basically accepted to be a guardian in the event of the parents deaths regardless of age. Yes you didn\u2019t on the second child but would you have the taken the same oldest had they been 13 when this happened? \n\nTake both or neither, it\u2019s a few years of your life to give them the best start in life. \n\nWhich decision will you regret most? That\u2019s your answer.", "YTA. You made their parents a promise. The worst has happened to them, and you promised to protect their child. Separating their children is the last thing the parents would ever want.\n\nObviously, legally this is still your decision. Morally, you made your decision many years ago when you promised to protect their children if something happened to them. Something did. Your real choice is whether you are willing to do right by your friends or not.", "NAH. Can't really blame you here. But maybe there are some adjustments that can be done to make it work out for everyone. I don't think they should be separated either at this delicate moment. But she's almost 18. She'll be his legal guardian soon. Idk the financial aspect of all of this, if you have enough money for this or they will Inherit something that will be of help to their future, so if it's possible, I'd suggest to take them both untill she's 18, then assist them with getting their own little place, and take a more \"advisory\" position, to help them with money, studies...etc.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Jo will help with Mo, it's not that long to make it work. I feel like just as a bleeding heart of a person I don't know how this decision isn't obvious.", "Are you on mobile or app?   The acronyms are in the side bar if you can see it with your browser.", "Here's the thing saying \"I actually wouldn't mind providing a place\" is different from \"I would absolutely want to take  care of this person since they've gone through so much, I'd like to provide a safe and loving home\". Maybe there are other people who can take both kids in.", "Talk to Jo and ask what she prefer to do", "So basically you either take them both or they get split up regardless? And godparents is that here but it is not legally binding and the kids end up with whomever would be best for them, regardless of godparent status. It tends also to be here that if you\u2019re godparents of one that doesn\u2019t mean you ignore the other and only dote on one. Mo would have seen that and probably wondered why you only bother with his sibling. \n\nYou\u2019re not legally obligated to take either but the right thing to do is to take both. It\u2019s an unfortunate tragic situation and they really should have told you before this happened but personally I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself casting him out like that. He\u2019s only got a a couple of years until he\u2019s able to drive in a lot of countries and you could work with Jo to be able to take on his guardianship in the future. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d go as far as to say AH but you and your wife do seem a bit unnecessarily cold/unbothered about Mo and his well-being. \n\nWhy won\u2019t the relatives take him? \n\nI just can\u2019t even begin to imagine how he\u2019s feeling. Being 13, lost your dad, your mums dying, your relatives don\u2019t want you, your sister is all you have left but she\u2019s wanting to leave you as the person who takes her isn\u2019t willing to take you with not much reason. Instead of carrying on with any form of normality in school with your friends you\u2019re being deported and put into foster care. Fucking heartbreaking. I think at 13 I\u2019d rather be with my sister after everything even if the people there didn\u2019t spend much time with me but I have fortunately never been in that situation. If he was younger I would be 1000% with you and that it would be better for him to find a loving family but he\u2019s not, he\u2019s 13, he\u2019s aware and he will remember what happens going forward. \n\nI think my judgement is ESH except the kids. The parents for lack of planning or even discussion, the relatives for refusing too and you and your wife for only caring about what happens to one kid. It is cruel to pick and choose siblings like that, they didn\u2019t ask for this. I do think you and the relatives should get together and come up with a legitimate plan to help both children rather than prioritising the needs of just one.", "If it's common for different kids to have different godparents and the godparent is who literally takes the child in the event of the parents' death, does that mean it's common for kids who lost both parents to be separated?", "Do you think no would even survive?", "Damm, you are soft.", "Nowhere did I get the impression he was considering forcing the daughter to live with him alone against her will.", "It\u2019s easy for us to say because we don\u2019t have to deal with it\u2026it would be the right thing for me to do to give away half my salary to charity because in theory I could still live off of half\u2026but I don\u2019t want to because it would be a major life change \n\nThis is a HUGE life change that isn\u2019t just black and white/good and bad\u2026what if they take them on and for whatever reason huge medical bills pile up they can\u2019t afford or something\u2026and to be honest if he truly doesn\u2019t want to take them on\u2026what sort of teenage years would a child grieving from the loss of parents have being raised by someone who clearly resents taking them in\n\nI guess the alternative would be foster homes which would most likely be worse but my point is if OP takes in both kids it\u2019s not like the story ends and everyone lives happily ever after\u2026it\u2019s a rest of your life commitment \n\nHonestly no matter what people on here say there\u2019s clearly a lot more to this matter (including legal stuff that he included in the edit I\u2019m sure no one thought about before passing judgement) that OP won\u2019t be able to articulate in a Reddit post and is going to have to talk to a lawyer and figure out what legally he can do, what he wants to take on, what he can take on, and make a decision there", "While we're clarifying acronyms,  what's the ESH one?", "The acronyms are in the wiki and sidebar.  \n\nYTA = You're the Asshole;\n\nYWBTA = You Would Be the Asshole;\n\nNTA = Not the A-hole;\n\nYWNBTA = You Would Not be the Asshole;\n\nESH = Everyone Sucks here;\n\nNAH = No A-holes here;\n\nINFO = Not Enough Info", "App.", "This gets tricky and I'm still consulting with attorneys.\n\nIn their country of residence, that would be the case if they were citizens.
