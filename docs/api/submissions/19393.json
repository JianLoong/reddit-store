You aren't his therapist, and that seems to be what he needs. Explain that you can't spend as much time as he'd like, and encourage him to seek other support now.", "I will say, prison changes people. I have known some people who did time. They lost everything we take for granted. Locking a bathroom door. I have never seen anyone so happy to be able to do that. Walking up behind one to hug him made him shake. That\u2019s a big no-no. It\u2019s loud. It stinks. There is no freedom of choice (bed time, shower time, meal time, rec time). It\u2019s a HUGE adjustment back to normal life. And no, they don\u2019t want to talk about it. They want it to stay gone while trying to get rid of fears and thoughts. Being outside is obviously a wonderful bonus for a newly freed person so it makes sense he likes the walks. It probably gives him time to process. He will eventually come out of that shell, but it will happen in _his_ time. It\u2019s up to you if you can be there while he tries to find himself again. You are NTA for not being able to do so, but your friend is still in there.", "NTA. It's pretty obvious that he needs much more serious help than a silent walk with a friend.  He is most likely suffering from some severe PTSD from some sort of \"unofficial\" punishment he was subjected to while in prison, so... yeah. That's beyond your scope to help. Point him towards a therapist, and support him if he decides to go, but you are in no way or form obligated to be his emotional crutch quite to this extent.", "NTA. That\u2019s A LOT of time to spend with anyone you don\u2019t live with.", "NTA.  Being there for him doesn't mean committing to anything he wants, and 20+ hours/week is unreasonable.  But something is obviously broken, so part of being there for him is encouraging him to get counseling.\n\nAlso, committing an act of animal cruelty bad enough to spend a year in jail is not a \"mistake\",  It's another indicator that there's something seriously wrong with him.  So protect yourself too.", "Nta but you don't have to choose the nuclear option, you can choose communication. \"That's rough, buddy. I know you're struggling right now and I'm trying to be here for you but you need a community and I'm just one guy who has a lot of other things going on. I can't always come on these walks but we can do x, y, or z.\" Be clear with your boundaries and intentions, and if you want to you can stay friends.", "NAH, this sounds like an awful scenario and I hope your competing needs can both be met.\n\n>Weirdest is that he acts super weird around dogs now, like on the few occasions we've been walking and couldn't avoid crossing paths with a dog walker, he goes totally quiet, wants to go wayyy further out of the way then we need to, and when I ask him what that's about he looks very anxious but just says \"nothing, it's fine.\"\n\nBased on this and all of his behavioral change, I think it's very likely he was \"disciplined\" by the K-9s in prison.\n\nHaving been an inmate myself in a southern US prison you'd be surprised how bad the unofficial \"punishments\" can be, especially for someone like a child or animal abuser. Either the officers arrange for the inmates to do it or even do it themselves. You see the rare story on the news where a CO gets in trouble for some wildly barbaric practice (like locking an inmate in a scalding shower) where someone dies, and think \"how did it even get that far\"...imagine all the cases where no one dies and no one hears about it.\n\nCertainly wouldn't be unheard of. A friend I kept in touch with after my prison time said there was an animal abuser in one of his blocks, and he got **quite** well-acquainted with those police dogs. *shudder*", "NAH - as much as you want to learn about what happened - you need to give him time. He may never confide in you on his experience but still, give him time. You can certainly begin to reduce the number of hours you spend with him - it was kind of you to do so in the beginning but you need to take care of yourself as well.", "Ya that dude had a very bad time in prison, including but definitely not limited to guard dogs. \n\nI'd say this is another resounding victory for our legal system. Damage all around. \n\nYWNBTA. If you can't handle it, you can't handle it. He needs a therapist. \n\nBut *info*: What did this guy do? For his entire social life to abandon him and to get a year and a day...I dunno...I gotta know", "Info- What did he do to an animal that got him over a YEAR in prison? Brock Turner got 6 months. No one gives a shit about animals, what did he do?", "You\u2019re NTA. Difficult to know what the dog hangup is without knowing what his animal cruelty charge was. Maybe he\u2019s afraid of it happening again. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily abandon him, he seems grateful for your support. But speak frankly with him and tell him you\u2019re concerned for him.", "NTA. He\u2019s clearly struggling and needs to look into therapy or counseling.", "NAH , but your friend probably endured something very traumatic and it\u2019s still haunting him now that he\u2019s out. You\u2019re not an AH, but kind of a bad friend if you abandon him.", "See I wondered if it was something like this, he never acted weird around dogs before.\n\nBut it's not like he had any scratch/bite/claw marks anywhere, and I saw him pretty much right when he got out. What would they be doing as a \"punishment\" that would do this to him?\n\nI don't want to believe that's true, surely our prisons don't allow stuff like *that*, the officers would be reported by *someone*. But knowing our system and how different he seems...I'm scared you might be right. Ugh.", "I was thinking the same.", "Do you know what it could have been? I wasn't under the impression that people were getting tortured at low-medium security prisons...scary.", "He could be on post-prison supervision that says he can\u2019t be around animals.", "The K-9 guards would know how to punish without leaving a mark, it would be easy to simulate attacks and call them off at the last minute or have the K-9s have him taken down and hold by the neck without breaking skin - it's sad but happens", "There are plenty of ways to make someone terrified of dogs even if they don\u2019t explicitly bite them. Just having a police dog charging at you so you had to run to safety would be terrifying. Especially after the 10th time or so and everyone\u2019s just laughing.", "Prison is hell, especially in America. It's not like in the movies or tv shows. It's an endless parade of cruelty, from the legal system, from the guards, from other inmates, from loss of friends and family. There does need to be some way to deal with antisocial behavior and repeat offenders, but the American prison system is one of the most unjust systems in the world.\n\nWrt the main question, you need to have some talks with your buddy about boundaries and realistic expectations about your time. But don't abandon him, or else the trauma he's experienced combined with the stigma of being a criminal will lead him straight back to prison. By the same token, don't beat yourself up too bad if he falls back into prison even with your help. That's what prison is designed to do: break people.", "I can\u2019t answer that definitely, but animal and child cruelty charges are not taken lightly in prisons\u2026 by the officers or the inmates. SA is also very common so anything really could have happened while he was in there. He might see you as a safe space. It sounds like being with you helps him cope with the bad thoughts. I think you should set boundaries, but if you love this person, continue to support him.", "I wish it were that simple to explain, but I remember talking with him at length about his sentence before he went in. \n\n5 years of not being allowed to own pets, reside at households containing pets, or visiting a household containing a pet for longer than three days (visits less than 3 days require probation officer notification and approval).\n\nBut nothing about being in their proximity out in public..."]}
