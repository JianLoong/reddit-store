You aren't his therapist, and that seems to be what he needs. Explain that you can't spend as much time as he'd like, and encourage him to seek other support now.", "I will say, prison changes people. I have known some people who did time. They lost everything we take for granted. Locking a bathroom door. I have never seen anyone so happy to be able to do that. Walking up behind one to hug him made him shake. That\u2019s a big no-no. It\u2019s loud. It stinks. There is no freedom of choice (bed time, shower time, meal time, rec time). It\u2019s a HUGE adjustment back to normal life. And no, they don\u2019t want to talk about it. They want it to stay gone while trying to get rid of fears and thoughts. Being outside is obviously a wonderful bonus for a newly freed person so it makes sense he likes the walks. It probably gives him time to process. He will eventually come out of that shell, but it will happen in _his_ time. It\u2019s up to you if you can be there while he tries to find himself again. You are NTA for not being able to do so, but your friend is still in there.", "NTA. It's pretty obvious that he needs much more serious help than a silent walk with a friend.  He is most likely suffering from some severe PTSD from some sort of \"unofficial\" punishment he was subjected to while in prison, so... yeah. That's beyond your scope to help. Point him towards a therapist, and support him if he decides to go, but you are in no way or form obligated to be his emotional crutch quite to this extent.", "NTA. That\u2019s A LOT of time to spend with anyone you don\u2019t live with.", "NTA.  Being there for him doesn't mean committing to anything he wants, and 20+ hours/week is unreasonable.  But something is obviously broken, so part of being there for him is encouraging him to get counseling.\n\nAlso, committing an act of animal cruelty bad enough to spend a year in jail is not a \"mistake\",  It's another indicator that there's something seriously wrong with him.  So protect yourself too.", "Nta but you don't have to choose the nuclear option, you can choose communication. \"That's rough, buddy. I know you're struggling right now and I'm trying to be here for you but you need a community and I'm just one guy who has a lot of other things going on. I can't always come on these walks but we can do x, y, or z.\" Be clear with your boundaries and intentions, and if you want to you can stay friends.", "NAH, this sounds like an awful scenario and I hope your competing needs can both be met.\n\n>Weirdest is that he acts super weird around dogs now, like on the few occasions we've been walking and couldn't avoid crossing paths with a dog walker, he goes totally quiet, wants to go wayyy further out of the way then we need to, and when I ask him what that's about he looks very anxious but just says \"nothing, it's fine.\"\n\nBased on this and all of his behavioral change, I think it's very likely he was \"disciplined\" by the K-9s in prison.\n\nHaving been an inmate myself in a southern US prison you'd be surprised how bad the unofficial \"punishments\" can be, especially for someone like a child or animal abuser. Either the officers arrange for the inmates to do it or even do it themselves. You see the rare story on the news where a CO gets in trouble for some wildly barbaric practice (like locking an inmate in a scalding shower) where someone dies, and think \"how did it even get that far\"...imagine all the cases where no one dies and no one hears about it.\n\nCertainly wouldn't be unheard of. A friend I kept in touch with after my prison time said there was an animal abuser in one of his blocks, and he got **quite** well-acquainted with those police dogs. *shudder*", "NAH - as much as you want to learn about what happened - you need to give him time. He may never confide in you on his experience but still, give him time. You can certainly begin to reduce the number of hours you spend with him - it was kind of you to do so in the beginning but you need to take care of yourself as well.", "Ya that dude had a very bad time in prison, including but definitely not limited to guard dogs. \n\nI'd say this is another resounding victory for our legal system. Damage all around. \n\nYWNBTA. If you can't handle it, you can't handle it. He needs a therapist. \n\nBut *info*: What did this guy do? For his entire social life to abandon him and to get a year and a day...I dunno...I gotta know", "Info- What did he do to an animal that got him over a YEAR in prison? Brock Turner got 6 months. No one gives a shit about animals, what did he do?", "You\u2019re NTA. Difficult to know what the dog hangup is without knowing what his animal cruelty charge was. Maybe he\u2019s afraid of it happening again. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily abandon him, he seems grateful for your support. But speak frankly with him and tell him you\u2019re concerned for him.", "NTA. He\u2019s clearly struggling and needs to look into therapy or counseling.", "NAH , but your friend probably endured something very traumatic and it\u2019s still haunting him now that he\u2019s out. You\u2019re not an AH, but kind of a bad friend if you abandon him.", "See I wondered if it was something like this, he never acted weird around dogs before.\n\nBut it's not like he had any scratch/bite/claw marks anywhere, and I saw him pretty much right when he got out. What would they be doing as a \"punishment\" that would do this to him?\n\nI don't want to believe that's true, surely our prisons don't allow stuff like *that*, the officers would be reported by *someone*. But knowing our system and how different he seems...I'm scared you might be right. Ugh.", "I was thinking the same.", "Do you know what it could have been? I wasn't under the impression that people were getting tortured at low-medium security prisons...scary.", "He could be on post-prison supervision that says he can\u2019t be around animals.", "The K-9 guards would know how to punish without leaving a mark, it would be easy to simulate attacks and call them off at the last minute or have the K-9s have him taken down and hold by the neck without breaking skin - it's sad but happens", "There are plenty of ways to make someone terrified of dogs even if they don\u2019t explicitly bite them. Just having a police dog charging at you so you had to run to safety would be terrifying. Especially after the 10th time or so and everyone\u2019s just laughing.", "Prison is hell, especially in America. It's not like in the movies or tv shows. It's an endless parade of cruelty, from the legal system, from the guards, from other inmates, from loss of friends and family. There does need to be some way to deal with antisocial behavior and repeat offenders, but the American prison system is one of the most unjust systems in the world.\n\nWrt the main question, you need to have some talks with your buddy about boundaries and realistic expectations about your time. But don't abandon him, or else the trauma he's experienced combined with the stigma of being a criminal will lead him straight back to prison. By the same token, don't beat yourself up too bad if he falls back into prison even with your help. That's what prison is designed to do: break people.", "I can\u2019t answer that definitely, but animal and child cruelty charges are not taken lightly in prisons\u2026 by the officers or the inmates. SA is also very common so anything really could have happened while he was in there. He might see you as a safe space. It sounds like being with you helps him cope with the bad thoughts. I think you should set boundaries, but if you love this person, continue to support him.", "I wish it were that simple to explain, but I remember talking with him at length about his sentence before he went in. \n\n5 years of not being allowed to own pets, reside at households containing pets, or visiting a household containing a pet for longer than three days (visits less than 3 days require probation officer notification and approval).\n\nBut nothing about being in their proximity out in public...", "NAH. Something traumatic happened while he was in prison, and it has something to do with dogs. He needs more help than you can provide.", "Surprised that you think he\u2019s not a bad guy. Those that hurt animals can move to hurting humans next. Find someone decent to spend your time with. This guy needs mental help not walks with you.", "You know he doesn't want to answer your questions so it's probably best to stop asking. When my SO doesn't want to talk about something, I just say, 'Okay, we won't talk about it, but if you ever want to talk about it, I'm here'.\n\nThat leaves the door open for the other person.\n\nIt's possible that no amount of your company will ever be enough, and he's always going to be distressed when you leave, so setting down boundaries is not going to make things worse. Set definite times for when you will meet up and when you will part and stick to them.\n\nNTA for finding this much of your time being taken up burdensome.", "NAH you are within your right to cut off someone or create distance if you truly don't get along. It's a matter of can you emotionally handle being this persons support system right now? If you can't then do what's best for yourself, however if you can then it seems like he needs someone in his corner to help him even if he can't ask for it. If he is the type of guy who is chill and you could have an open conversation with I would ask him if he's considered therapy, support groups, or reaching out to his family so your not his only method of support. It's really hard to feel isolated and alone especially if he has suffered some trauma for time served. This issue is something that could impede and effect a lot of things in his life so if your willing to help I would be open with him about how your feeling. \"I'm worried about you and a little overwhelmed because I feel like you need someone to be with you x many hours a day and I can't do that every week. I wanted to know if you'd be open to therapy or joining a club to put yourself out there and try to cope with what's happened or move on. How can I help you with this?\" Again though if you don't really care and don't want to take on that responsibility since it's not your job, then I would just let him know you gotta limit the walks and keep it to minimum contact.", "YTA", "INFO:  why are you attempting to get him to talk about his time in prison?", "INFO - why are you entitled to knowing what happened to him in prison when you won\u2019t even allow the people your asking for judgment the knowledge of what he did? \n\nWhat is the difference in these that makes one supposedly free to all knowledge and the other a top rank secret?", "NTA- You're trying to be a good friend.  It's obvious you care.\n\nYou can keep your promise.  You said you would be there for him. You can still be there.  Having boundaries in place will help that. \n\n20 to 30 hours a week is excessive for any friendship.\n\nPerhaps if you had a weekly thing to plan.  A weekly walk, or something.", "I hope you can find a support group he can join, maybe go to the first couple meetings with him.  Maybe if you tell him you want to be his friend but you can't be his main support,  which is what it feels like he wants from you now.", "NAH\n\nYour friend had PTSD. You are absolutely not trained to handle it. It has only been a few weeks, you're allowed to set some boundaries and let him know you are limited in how much time you can spend with him. But you are probably a lifeline right now. \n\nPlease offer to help him find some mental health services. I don't think anyone comes out of prison without mental health issues. The kinds of things that could have happened to him probably don't even occur to you. If he was put into solitary confinement, that's incredibly damaging. He could have been raped. He could have been punished by the COs with the dogs. An animal cruelty charge is not something that people celebrate in prison by the other inmates. \n\nGetting out of prison is incredibly difficult. There is no normal to go back to. I work with people who have left prison, and a lot of them still are working around their PTSD triggers decades later. They struggle to be in a crowded room, being touched unexpectedly, sleeping. \n\nIf you want to let us know if you're in the US, and what state you're in if so, I might be able to find some resources for you to pass on to him. \n\nYou are not responsible for him, you can't fix him, but if you tell him \"let's do one walk a week and catch up, but I can only go for an hour\" that would still be super helpful.", "NTA.\n\nFirst off, if everyone else stopped talking to him, it is likely for a good reason. \n\nOn paper, he went to prison for whatever he was found guilty for - but the reality is that, he had traits\u2026 bad traits\u2026 that led to his sentence.  He has attitudes, he has belief systems, he has compulsions, whatever the fuck it is, it led to him going to prison.   And he has to work on those traits.  You don\u2019t just come out of prison expecting the world to be cool with you, or that everything is resolved.  Your friend has a lot of unresolved bullshit.  \n\nHe has to earn people\u2019s trust again, and if everyone else bailed on him, then he has a lot of work to do.  and you would not be TA at all, if you decided to distance yourself as well \n\nI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with walking.  But, something happened to him.  Whatever it is, he needs more help than a silent walk - and you\u2019re only 23. You just don\u2019t have the resources or the tools to help him. You\u2019re not his therapist and you\u2019re not his parent. It would be unfair for him to expect you to be his \u201clifeline.\u201d There is nothing wrong with being there for a friend, but you also need to look out for yourself, and realize that you\u2019re just a very young adult who can only help him so much.", "Oh man, my bf did some time and he had quite the story.\n\nSomeone in his cell got caught with contraband or whatever, and they came by the next day with the K-9s to \"search\" the cell. The cellmates had to sit backs to the wall, hands under their butts, as the dogs \"searched.\"\n\nDidn't take him long to find out the \"search\" was more of a **\"punishment.\"** The dogs searched them and the cells...but spend an inordinate amount of time with their faces right in the cellmates' face, just panting. I'm talking 10+ minutes each. Apparently it was intimidating and awful, my bf was gagging and retching from the dog breath but if they ever moved they were warned not to \"interfere with the search.\"\n\nI'm sure it goes down in the books as just a \"routine cell search\" and any stories to the contrary from inmates are summarily dismissed. Made them all threaten to kick the ass of anyone else ever caught with contraband though, which I guess was the point. He said he was nauseous the rest of the day.", "I was just coming to say that.  I can attest that people who harm animals or children are not going to have a good or even halfway decent time in prison. This is one of the occasions where the COs and inmates are happy to work together.", "A friend was a prison guard years ago. He told me that they would give a metal pipe to one inmate and anyone who hid or was otherwise not available when the guards wanted them got a visit from the pipe.", "RIGHT? why did i have to scroll so far for this??? imo if anyone does anything harmful to an animal i\u2019m dropping them. BUT THIS DUDE WENT TO PRISON BC OF AN ANIMAL???? wtf", "OP says it was a sex offense. I uh, don't really want any other info at that point. \ud83d\ude2c", "She said it was sexual", "What country are you in? Because America is OBSESSED with dogs. \u201cNo one gives a shit about animals\u201d is blatantly false in the US, at least as it pertains to dogs.", "What sort of \"unofficial\" punishment in prison makes someone scared of leashed dogs on walks in the park...\n\nEDIT: Without leaving a mark on the person, that is. I get that police dogs are scary but OP said he didn't have any tooth/claw marks or anything.", "That's on the very light side of what you could probably expect...\n\nIn the case my friend was aware of...well, let's just say police K-9s are very well trained. They can urinate and defecate on command. If the officer decides that's going to be on your face every Friday and Tuesday night at 10pm, well...\n\nHe'd even said he's heard rumors that at another prison, an inmate was >!raped by K-9s (many police dogs are intact)!<.\n\nI hope for OP's friend's sake it wasn't that bad, but even what you described would likely be traumatizing.", "I find it very hard to believe that convicted felons would be traumatized by dog breath...lol.\n\nDog breath isn't that bad even, is it?", "have you personally known what's happened to animal abusers in prison? What \"punishments\" do they give them?", "Unfortunately, it's pretty common. Your friend needs professional help, there's a solid chance there's some underlying trauma there.", "Think about the most depraved, vicious criminal you can. Rapists, murderers, torturers. Heinous crimes. Right?  Prison guards do that kind of shit to inmates every day and never get in trouble for it unless someone dies in a way they can't pass off as an accident or suicide. That's the reality of prison.", "The things prisons allow would horrify you.

A lot of them ended up with Hepatitis because of it. \n\nRape, torture, of the worst possible kind. \n\nOur prison system is not fair or good. Think of what cops have been seen to do, and imagine they were in a place with people to watch that everyone hates, and know no one will ever see video or be able to tell anyone what happened.

It makes sense that no one else wants anything to do with him now.", "Animal abuse generally has to be pretty heinous for there to be charges &amp; even then, it\u2019s usually a fine &amp; some classes. The only time I\u2019ve ever heard of anyone going to prison for animal cruelty is those involved in dogfighting because the stuff they do is seriously sick &amp; twisted. And imo, if someone can do that to a dog, there\u2019s at least one dead hooker in their past, it\u2019s that bad.", "America. Where you either have your dog trained, or have it put to sleep.

His ears are cropped cruelly short (they were clearly just snipped off with scissors when he was a puppy; there is absolutely nothing left of the exterior ears beyond a narrow ridge of cartilage), and he's just covered in puncture scars, especially on his neck and front legs. He's clearly been badly traumatized, and is a very anxious boy who is afraid of just about everything, but is so incredibly sweet.

If anything of all the things one could do to an animal to get over a year in prison this is by far the **least** egregious. \n\nWhat's the alternative, running a dogfighting ring or dismembering and torturing animals for fun? What were you assuming OP did before this detail that was *less* bad than this?", "He did something awful enough to spend a year in prison. I personally don't need any more information than that and I wouldn't want all the gory details if it was a child either.", "I really do not suggest reading or watching A Clockwork Orange or 1984 if you can avoid it. \n\nYou can be super into anything but the right conditioning will absolutely turn that into a trigger.", "Are you sure this is the argument that you want to make? Raping an animal is a violent and disgusting act that can leave permanent physical and mental trauma. Why do you feel the need to defend it as a lesser offense?", "We have a very imperfect legal system. I just wanted the facts. I don\u2019t recall expressing any opinion about what kind of animal abuse is worse than others, other than saying \u201cI think we\u2019d all guessed sex crime at this point.\u201d", "Never said anything about the gory details. All I said was I wanted the full context. OP just said it was a sex crime. That explains everything from friends abandoning them, to being afraid of dogs post release (you can fill in the blanks since you're not a details guy). Though I do think you'd probably want to know if your friend was convicted of a sex crime, you know? Maybe just that *one* tough detail. At least so that you can continue to be their apologist accurately.  \n\nGet off that horse (not literally).", "I mean, if you can name even one *non-sexual* act that OP's friend could have done with an animal that could even conceivably warrant a *year in prison*, and which is *less* harmful to the animal than this, I'm listening.", "Wait, how would it explain being afraid of dogs, if he previously had, uh, quite the attachment to them?"]}
