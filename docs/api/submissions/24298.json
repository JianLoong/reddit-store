He also wouldn\u2019t let us call his parents to let them know what was going on.  My dad loved us and he hated when we worried about him.  It would piss me off when he kept secrets about his health from us.   My point is that maybe your husband just didn\u2019t want you to worry until he knew what was going on.  I get why you\u2019re mad, but you need to be honest with yourself and him about it.  Tell him why you\u2019re mad.

He can still have healthcare privacy but you should be informed/ contacted if he's not mentally able to understand what happened.

Your feelings of jealousy and frustration at him are truly misguided. If you reacted in a supportive manner when you were informed maybe next time he\u2019d be more inclined to clue you in faster. It\u2019s not as if he is withholding this information in a malicious way either, as such your reaction isn\u2019t justified, especially given how worried he could be about his health. Now this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t feel upset or jealous of his best friend, or even a little hurt by it all. But you should put this aside and be supportive and address your concerns at a later date. That\u2019s what YTA here. Your priorities are wrong and that\u2019s just a little disappointing to see. I would be less inclined to call you for help if that happened to me. \n\nIt seems likely that you react poorly to emergency situations or at least worse than his best friend and that is why he\u2019d choose him instead.

That\u2019s because they have seen real conflict, emergencies, and accidents, and as such can keep composed in stressful or difficult situations.

I know when I\u2019m not doing well it upsets her, and I can find that difficult, with my friends that is never an issue. \n\nAt the end of the day your husband\u2019s support system is unique to him.

I'm sure OP is embarassed which is why she is looking for validation from this sub, but this situation is something that can be resolved with sincere communication between the two of them", "A lot of guys are afraid to show any kind of vulnerability or weakness around their partner as a result of the fucked up gender norms of society.  Theres a million threads on reddit of dudes lamenting that the first time they ever opened up to their GF or showed any kind of weakness (often after being asked repeatedly to do so by the GF) the GF becomes disgusted and leaves them.\n\nShe literally says in the post he didn't contact her in the first incident cause he didn't want her to worry.  Thats classic \"can't show weakness\" stuff.  He needs to always be the supporter, not the supported, likely because he's afraid she will leave him if he ever needs help.  Its fucked, and something the couple needs to work on together (it takes mutual trust, which is hard to develop), but not atypical.  The best friend is probably one of the only people allowed to see the husband truly vulnerable.\n\nThe fact that she reacted like she did will only reinforce that belief in him and make him less likely to come to her in the future if he needs help.", "Lol, passing out could just be dehydration on a hot day.", "Thank you. Jesus. I can't believe this had to be said.", "Telephones exist. Doctors won\u2019t just shrug because a wife isn\u2019t at bedside and default to the body that is. They will do life-saving care regardless. They won\u2019t stop until the spouse can be reached to tell them not to.\n\nAs for her not being there if he passes? That sucks, but it\u2019s his call to make. And in this case he wasn\u2019t at the hospital. It was an on-site medic. Maybe if they were worried enough to transfer him to the hospital he would have had them call her (the previous instance when he was in the ER he wasn\u2019t married yet, so that\u2019s not exactly an example of what he would do now).", "rigggghhhhttt.  He's an ass because SHE might not get to speak to him again.  I mean, my god man!  How much more selfish can you get than thinking of your OWN comfort and ease during a medical emergency instead of your spouses' feelings!\n\nYeah, dude's dead but HE'S the ass for not giving her the opportunity to say goodbye, or to curse him out one last time, or to wail and fall out in front of everyone, or whatever selfish people do when their entitlement kicks in.  \n\n/s/s/s/s/s/s", "Simply going to the emergency room doesn't mean 'it's serious.'\n\nBut, in this case, it also doesn't matter; he didn't go to the emergency room.  He had on-site medical attention from on-site medical staff, and they told him to follow up with his GP.  He got home and discussed this all with his wife, who threw a decade-old incident in his face and told him to go fuck himself.", "But contacts the best friend? \nWondering if the wife is the beard?", "NOTHING in the OP states they went to the ER.\n\nLearn to read before you comment.", "Who the fuck do you think is going to be responsible for medical decisions if something goes wrong? Who\u2019s going to help him with aftercare and in making sure something hasn\u2019t gone wrong?\n\nLike holy shit people, have none of you ever dealt with a serious medical emergency with your spouses before?", "Because they have no idea how serious trust is in a  marriage and want to sound edgy.", "I don\u2019t even find it weird. I had cancer twice with a stroke in between. I wouldn\u2019t take anyone to my oncology appointments. I\u2019m much more medically knowledgeable than my husband and he\u2019s a worrywort.", "Uh, a trip to the ER does mean a potential to be serious.  That\u2019s something a spouse should be made aware of. Why is this so hard to understand?", "Read the first sentence", "It entirely depends on how his best friend vs. OP react to these kinds of things though. As examples: if she is an incessant worrier, or antagonistic to the medics who are caring for him, or instantly blames him for being in that position in the first place. There are behaviors that the loved ones of sick people display that are not helpful and sometimes border into harmful. \n\nWe don\u2019t know if OP is any of these things, of course. But if someone\u2019s loved one has behaviors like these then they can and should call people who will actually be helpful to them in their time of need.", "Being good in a crisis is a skill not everybody has. My Mil is awful at it. She freaks out, badgers the doctors, and at the same time won't admit anything is wrong. Her daughter(my wife) has been a crisis therapist. My wife handles her Dad's medical stuff because she can stay calm and rational long enough to get all the relevant information.\n\nDude may have just picked the best person for the job of being there. OP doesn't exactly seem to be on the calm side.", "YTA HIS body, his choice. He needed somebody supportive who would focus on him, not someone who shows up all emotional and focused on their own reaction. I'm being his wife's reaction from the first accident caused his reaction with this accident.", "You sound like a woman saying that. Which you may be. Nothing wrong with that. Sometimes women don\u2019t realise that their panic does not help us and we don\u2019t want to be around you in a scary time like that. It\u2019s not personal, but sometimes we know that in this specific situation, you won\u2019t be of any help. It doesn\u2019t mean we hate you. We just recognise that for this specific instance, you are not the right person to call.", "Or she could be like my wife, I love her, but in emergency situations, she freaks out and makes everything worse.", "\"tendency\" sort of requires more than one instance of something happening. we have one example.", "shes allowed emotions too.", "I'm with you! YTA, OP.", "No she didn\u2019t.", "No, we actually cannot.", "Nothing in the OP states he went to the ER.", "She didn\u2019t \u201cthrow it in his face\u201d she asked him last time a VERY similar event happened to inform her if something like this happened again and he made specifically sure that she didn\u2019t get informed. Sounds short sighted and stupid.", "I guess most people here are not married or in a relationship where your partner is someone you actually speak to and share your life with.", "To be fair it does seem as if he has consistently denied her the opportunity to show how she would deal with these situations. It\u2019s hard to show how you can play if you\u2019re never let on the field. What, honestly, is his deal that he wants to deny her caring for him in sickness and in health? Why? It\u2019s the fundamental question. So she\u2019s competent enough for him to ask her uninformed assessment but not competent enough to be by his side in the hospital? What the actual F?", "This!! I grew up with an incessant worriers too. One would have a medical emergency herself (she has a condition so not her fault) and the other would yell and scream at everyone else if things weren't handled her way. We learned to inform them last. Much easier to fix things without the drama or additional emergency", "That's a lot of assumptions there. They've been married for a decade and she said her feelings were hurt and she wanted to be able to ask questions to help support his recovery, but some of y'all are making it sound like having your literal spouse express concern is somehow a narcissistic trait. Telling your spouse you've been injured or in am accident is pretty standard procedure, not petty.\n\nYTA", "Agree with all this. She is clearly self-focused.", "Um, what? Women are certainly not the only ones who can panic in medical emergencies. While I agree it may be that OP was not the best person to have around in a medical emergency, that's not a gender-based detail.", "I have seen grown men pass out giving blood. I had three children I\u2019ve seen blood I\u2019ve seen poop vomit I\u2019ve seen my kids get hurt so that is a very sexist comment.", "That was sexiest to say not all women panic some better in these situations then some men who panic and freak out. You are so freaking sexiest.", "Yes only one instance has been shared with us and OP is the wife here so the story is also very one-sided. Although I wouldn't be surprised it occurs more often in their 10 years of marriage for the husband to be that way in an emergency and OP doesn't disclose because of course it doesn't look good for her part. Well I am only assuming and this is reddit. We are all just saying our opinions/theories", "She has listed on example.  Its very possible he has witnessed her in a crisis before and didn't like what he saw.", "Yes she is. So is OP's husband. OP can reflect on this experience too. One thing is for sure though.. they both need to resolve this so it doesn't happen again", "Sure, she can have emotions, but her emotions aren't the priority here as she's not the one having the medical emergency. Much like sometimes people don't want the partner in the delivery room if they won't be able to be supportive.", "Sure.  And her emotions are valid. \n\nBut her reactions may not be helpful in the moment.  And if he knows that about his wife, then maybe he made the best choice for himself, you know, the person actually who was passed out.", "Lol she literally told him \u201cif you didn\u2019t care enough to let me know something was wrong when it was wrong\u2026I don\u2019t care enough to care now\u201d that\u2019s not only being petty but making it about her feelings in the end. That because her feelings are so hurt by him not contacting her, she\u2019s gonna be petty and not care about what\u2019s wrong with him since her feelings were hurt.", "If 'the last time this happened' is ten years ago, then yes, bringing it up again is, in fact, throwing it in his face.\n\nSomething similar didn't happen here.  He didn't go to the emergency room.  There was no explosion.  The issue was so unserious that he was able to finish his day of work, and the on-site medical staff, who have liability issues, workplace safety laws, and all that stuff to worry about, said 'yeah, just go visit your doctor in a few days.'\n\nThere was literally nothing to tell her at the moment, he clearly doesn't work in an office environment where he can just take half an hour to phone his wife, and he *did* tell her the moment he got home, and tried to involve her, just like she asked.", "It's a bunch of children who have no idea what a real relationship below you. The person who replied to you about wanting to talk in person is also missing the point. Yeah, obviously you do that too. But you still let your partner you had a medical issue *when it happens*. Not hours later ffs.\n\nAlso all the people saying this isn't a medical emergency.... the man *passed out*. I don't care how minor it is, it's still a fucking emergency and if you respect your partner, you fucking let them know immediately.", "Yes, what he\u2019s doing in context is abnormal. Your wife can make medical decisions for you, but your friend without a medical power of attorney cannot. I feel like OP is going to have a very weird convo with hubby if she gets him to open up, because this is so illogical that it usually only means convoluted feelings are involved.", "Op could also be a nurse working 12s and he knew not to bother her at work.  Not nearly enough context here.", "and? i'm responding to someone using the word \"tendency\" to talk about one example. we don't know there's a tendency because we have *one example*", "i never said they were priority. but if he gives a shit about his wife, communicating medical emergencies is pretty fucking important.\n\nlike i said in my other comment, her feelings dont need to be addressed before his are, but they DO need addressed eventually. op and her husband need to talk either way.", "She\u2019s fucking worried about her HUSBAND dying. Why is this so hard to understand?", "I don\u2019t know about you but I don\u2019t recall a single time in my so far 15ish years working that I had medical personnel respond to something that happened. In fact of all the people I\u2019ve know. Or worked with I can only thing of my high school girlfriend who passed out in gym class and sent me a message within a few minutes of recovering just to make sure I was updated on the situation. \n\nThis is abnormal even if it wasn\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d by your standards. Sorry for your SO if you have one that there needs to be a broken bone or a heart attack for you to feel they\u2019re important enough to be updated on a possible medical issue.\n\nThe sane people in his office jumped right to \u201chmm I think we should tell your wife\u201d and he specifically told them not to."]}
