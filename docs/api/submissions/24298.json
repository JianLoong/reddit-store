He also wouldn\u2019t let us call his parents to let them know what was going on.  My dad loved us and he hated when we worried about him.  It would piss me off when he kept secrets about his health from us.   My point is that maybe your husband just didn\u2019t want you to worry until he knew what was going on.  I get why you\u2019re mad, but you need to be honest with yourself and him about it.  Tell him why you\u2019re mad.

He can still have healthcare privacy but you should be informed/ contacted if he's not mentally able to understand what happened.

She does care about what the doctor said, but feels rejected and is childishly trying to reject him right back.", "He's not really asking for a medical diagnosis, he's really asking if he'll be ok because he's worried/scared. \n\nAny normal person would have replied with something like \"I'm sure it's nothing, maybe stress/heat/tiredness related\"", "Yeah three quarters of her reasons for wanting to be involved are about her. Her partner went to the hospital and her overriding feeling is that her hurt feelings about the situation are the most important aspect of it.", "Your post tells us exactly why.\n\nEven if you are upset that he didn't call, your reaction is to be petty and decide you shouldn't care about his health at all? Why tf would he WANT to call you then if that's all it takes to not care about him anymore? You can be annoyed at someone and still care.", "Based on what you say here, he made the right call", "Well, maybe his best friend didn't say \"I don't care what the results are.\" \n\nHis best friend would have said something like: \"It's okay, you're going to be fine, and even if it's something bad, we're here for you.\" That's the kind of person you want to call when you're scared.", "And you have confirmed to him that he made the right call", "Maybe trust that the husband knows if it's a good idea to get the wife involved early?", "Found the histrionic, men will always be wrong in your eyes lmao", "This is not true at all. 12 years ago, if he was in the ICU then obviously only family. He would have only been there for half or less of his stay. After that he can have whatever visitors he wants. He chose not to see her then and chose not to see her now. \n\nWe don't know who he listed as his emergency contact. Maybe she handles stress badly etc, we don't know. But we all know calling her is better than her worrying if he doesn't come home. What he did was awful. He chose to call his friend and pointedly excluded her. It's his legal right to privacy, but that doesn't mean he's morally right and she's still who they'll call if they need consent unless he has a medical power of attorney. All in all what he did was stupid. What she did was make him live with that decision.", "She's holding a grudge from 12 years ago and is making this all about her.\n\n100% she would've created stress and drama. He's just passed out at work and getting checked out, he's in a very stressful and nervous position.", "Ah, so when woman is in labor, she shouldn't have right to chose if father of the child, he should always be allowed to be there, right?", "I was once at the ER for something and I specifically said that my mother should not come, because I know she makes everything worse.  Of course she showed up and proceeded to tell me that whatever it was, was all my fault.  I told her to get out, she's a tiny bit better now.", "My dad did that once. My mom isn't particularly the kind to panic or make things worse, but he's the kind that doesn't like to make a fuss when something happens.\n\nHe almost fainted doing yard work, thought it was a heatstroke, took a cool shower, went about his day. The next day, he was in a helicopter, being transferred to a hospital so he wouldn't die of the heart attack that had been going on for more than 8 hours now. \n\nPlease, if you're the kind to shrug off stuff because you don't want people to worry, stop. I could kill you.", ">He did not call me and asked his co workers not to call me because he didn\u2019t want me to worry.\n\n\"I explained to him after that accident that I would have like to been there for support, to talk to doctors, to ask questions, to learn aftercare and anything else that was important information.\"\n\nShe explained why communicating is important in a relationship, he just chose to ignore her because he's an asshole. He thinks he has the right to keep things from her - \"100% \" he would lose his fucking mind if she did the same to him. He's not in an equal relationship - he considers himself to be the adult and her to be the child. Which makes him doubly an asshole.", "I think based on her post, it's pretty clear she's a bit self involved. Would've made this all about her.\n\n100% he would've had to comfort and support her at the hospital, his buddy would support him.", "Oh my God, my mother does the same thing!! If I'm not feeling well, she gets aggressive, starts blaming me, goes on a woe-be-me trip. I haven't told her about any health issue in about ten years.", ">Suspicious on if they care about me like they say they do.\n\nIn that situation the play would then surely be \"double check that my behaviour is such that I am definitely included\" not \"I tried saying I should be included, did nothing to change how I act and now I'm out of ideas\"", "Holy crap, this resonates with me. I'm due to have a small surgery soon (local anaesthetic) and my sister is BUGGING me about me going to her house to recover. I have someone at home who can care for me IF I need it, or who can contact medical professionals IF I need it - I don't need to be fussed and worried over in my sister's spare room, which is small, too warm, and has a tiny bed I can't get comfy in. \n\nBut nope, she insists because, and I quote: \"I just need to look after you; it'll make me feel better.\" As in, it'll make HER feel better. So fuck my comfort, right? I've told her no, several times, and I'll keep saying no. It's not even needed! Gah!\n\nIt makes me wish she never knew it was happening in the first place.", "Shes holding a grudge over an accident 12 years ago when they just started dating?\n\nShe is very childish and selfish.\n\nI guarantee if she had come along he'd be the one supporting and comforting her instead of how it should be. That's why he called his buddy, because his friend would be a source of comfort not stress.\n\nShe never even mentioned how he was feeling or why he did that, her entire post was entirely me me me me me", "I mean I agree with both of you. If the wife is this bad that he doesn't want her around in an emergency, I don't see what the point of the marriage is", "Redditors are ridiculous. Why the fuck are people in relationships with people they can't trust or don't want to tell important things to. I can't fathom my partner not being the first person I tell if something went wrong, and I'd be pissed af if I found I was the last to know something from him. Your partner being the last to know about something like this is not a sign of a healthy relationship", ">She is very childish and selfish.\n\nYou think she's childish and selfish for expecting open and honest communication in a relationship? I pity your miserable family.", "So let\u2019s say you just had a scary medical incident, I\u2019ve fainted and that shit is scary, one moment everything is cool then you feel a little weird for a second and then everything goes black and you hit the floor. So that happens to you then when you tell your parent about it they make it about themselves and bring up shit from over a decade ago. What would you do?", "Nobody said \"last to know\" youte making a strawman argument. OP is making this about her when her husband is dealing with his own shit. Nobody cares if you can fathom it or not, youre not important to their story.", "Because you can love someone even if there are things about them you don't love.\n\nThis person sounds like they become a gigantic pain in the ass around doctors, so the spouse just avoids having them in those situations.", "Clearly you didn't read the rest of my comment before leaping to conclusions, having an overly emotional reaction and laying in a personal attack.\n\nI believe I know why you identity with the op now, but I won't assume it to be true.", "You said he's not obligated to let her know. Why call someone your partner if you don't want them to actually be one?", "And you made it pretty clear how you treat the people close to you - as I said, I pity your poor, miserable family for ever daring to express emotion or expect open communication  from someone supposed to love you.", "Not letting someone know something right away doesnt mean they arent your partner. Thats just a rule you made up. Im not saying i wouldnt tell my partner, im just saying, people do things differently. It doesnt mean you dont love someone.", "You sure this isn't an alt account? The main character syndrome appears strong", "hey did you strain your back from that reach? jfc", "BOOM. Thought the same thing.", "You sure you don't want to go yell at your family for being emotional?"]}
