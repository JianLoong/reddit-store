Now, what isn't ok is you using your hurt feelings as a weapon and saying mean things that I'm sure you really don't think. Yall both take a breather.

He also wouldn\u2019t let us call his parents to let them know what was going on.  My dad loved us and he hated when we worried about him.  It would piss me off when he kept secrets about his health from us.   My point is that maybe your husband just didn\u2019t want you to worry until he knew what was going on.  I get why you\u2019re mad, but you need to be honest with yourself and him about it.  Tell him why you\u2019re mad.

He can still have healthcare privacy but you should be informed/ contacted if he's not mentally able to understand what happened.

However, legally, she just needs to be informed, which he eventually did. If something worse had happened, she will probably still be informed to make decisions but she will be informed by the best friend, which her husband prefers. Why the husband didn't inform her that he decided to go with his best friend as his contact in case of emergency..we don't know.. or maybe he did and she just didn't accept it. Husband has his reasons. Could be just a practical decision; maybe best friend lives right next door to where husband works..who knows. Or it could be that OP inclines more towards drama, which I'm leaning toward as to why the husband decided this. \n\nIt's still beside the point of this AITA post made by OP. She is just pissed and ranting here that she isn't THE FIRST one to be informed and promptly caused drama over it as soon as she was..which just confirms that the husband made the right decision to have his best friend informed first and instructed his coworkers not to inform her. It's clear from this post that she is more concerned by the technicality that she wasn't informed first yet she doesn't appreciate her husband coming home in one piece to tell her the news himself..rather she chose to spend her time trying to justify her actions on this platform instead of attending to her husband who is probably home with her right now.

I judged OP as TA for the way she treated her husband. If she was frustrated she could have communicated better.

How in the world did this get upvoted (again) what ego??

I've been to the hospital a couple times in the last few years and I just made my wife drop me off at the entrance. It was better than making her wait for hours while I was groaning in pain. I'd rather text her once I know what's going on and work from there.", "Exactly. My mother was insisting on being present when I was in and out of the hospital recovering from covid. Nothing she did or said was helpful. If anything all of her useless questions and pretending to know what she's talking about was more stressful and embarrassing than helpful.

Sure she has a right to be upset but then not even caring about his follow up? To your point, it can be a symptom of something serious and her response is to act like a child and pretend she doesn't care. GTFOH", "You are projecting. Passing out but not being admitted to hospital is not the same as not wanting someone there for your final moments. The normal thing to do when you have to wait to see a health professional about symptoms you have experienced is to talk it through, it is unlikely he was actually asking her for a diagnosis just looking to include her in his processing of the situation. So she wants to be part of the drama, but not the boring privately reassuring bit. And she excuses it by saying when he got severe burns when they first started dating he did the same... when you first start dating the last thing you want if for your new partner to see you with your skin all blistered up and high on pain meds so it seems unfair to hold it against him 12yrs later for the sake of making herself look better in a similar but equally totally different scenario.", "If I was the least me me me person or the most me me me person ever, it would not matter because If i expected a person to call me in their time of need vs not, everything I do or say could easily turn into me me me.\n\nIn this particular case, it's hard to know how to judge, but if OP was angry that her husband in a theoretical scenario would not call her, then she is DEF NTA.\n\nHonestly, If I was married to someone, and they had not explicitly made it clear I would not be their first contact in a theoretical hospital visit, I would need some explanation. Maybe the anger should not play out in response to an actual situation, but like yeah, I definitely see where she is coming from.\n\nIf what you say is true in terms of the actual reason husband's part, I get it, but like he should make that clear to her before an emergency arises.", "Yeah, this has nothing to do with the OP.", "I'd understand if it all happened so fast that no one could be contacted, but finding out that my partner would rather talk to his best friend and *prevented a co-worker from telling me* would make me seriously reassess my relationships.", "Lots of serious things could have caused it as well, and the OP is going to be partly responsible for watching out for further signs of trouble.", "I don't know, I'd certainly call my wife but she also wouldn't react the way OP is if I didn't.

My wife is pregnant, and there have been some complications with her pregnancy. My wife has asked me a lot of questions about her health while waiting for answers from doctors; often in tears. I think it's what she's always thinking about, and she wants someone she loves to assure her that everything is going to be ok. I think it'd be cruel to not help her in her times of need, the same way I think OP is being cruel. Maybe her husband needs some time to absorb the info himself first. Maybe that is a little selfish.

OP never in fact indicates that in the previous case (when they had only just started dating) she had asked him for the information.
