He told me the medics were called and now he has to go to the doctor to get blood work done. He did not call me and asked his co workers not to call me because he didn\u2019t want me to worry. It really hurt my feelings. This comes after an accident that happened just after we started dating. He was involved in a serious explosion that caused 1st and 2nd degree burns on the right side of his face and arm. He didn\u2019t call me until her was getting discharged from the hospital as I was not listed as an emergency contact yet. I explained to him after that accident that I would have like to been there for support, to talk to doctors, to ask questions, to learn aftercare and anything else that was important information. \nWell after he told me about todays incident, he began asking what I think it could have been, what it could be, what the Dr might say, and so on. I told him if you didn\u2019t t care enough to let me know something was wrong when it was wrong\u2026I don\u2019t care enough to care now.

Should he have called? Yep. But you don't have to compound the situation by being flippant and refusing to help him through this. Have some empathy and do the right thing for the person you are going through life with.", "YTA me, me, me that's all this post was about, so you don't actually care to support your spouse you just want to be the first to know", "Both are in the wrong. You are his spouse and you should have been called, especially since you said that he was to himself and wasn't blackout or out of his mind he had his full mental capabilities and knew how you felt. Now we both know you truly are worried, and you truly do care what the dr will say. You're just mad at the situation of him not letting you know which you have every right to be upset about. Now, what isn't ok is you using your hurt feelings as a weapon and saying mean things that I'm sure you really don't think. Yall both take a breather. Sit down and explain that you are hurt by his actions and you were in the wrong to lash out at him because you were hurt. Then, after everything is cooled down and no more hurt feelings on either side, the issue that caused all of this needs to be discussed.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say just barely NTA.  Here\u2019s why: My dad passed away 2 and a half years ago at 74. My dad had a lot of medical issues throughout his adulthood but he never really liked to tell my mom everything the doctors would tell him.  He also wouldn\u2019t let us call his parents to let them know what was going on.  My dad loved us and he hated when we worried about him.  It would piss me off when he kept secrets about his health from us.   My point is that maybe your husband just didn\u2019t want you to worry until he knew what was going on.  I get why you\u2019re mad, but you need to be honest with yourself and him about it.  Tell him why you\u2019re mad.  Tell him if he does it again, he\u2019s going to need a trauma surgeon after you\u2019re done with him. His health problems affect you too and you should know what\u2019s happening.  How would he feel if something like that happened to you and you didn\u2019t bother to tell him until later? Maybe you should ask him that.", "So, he did tell you about what he needs to follow up on and your mad he didn't tell you right after it happened? When one is passed out, they can't talk. When someone is getting assessed by medics- you don't make calls. After one has a medical issue- they need to process things. It's not like he kept this from you.

You can now go with him to the doctors and ask all the things you want to. Except for the fact that you chastised and so now I'd understand if he wants to go himself. \n\nIf I passed out at work and had a visit from paramedics, I wouldn't tell my partner until I saw her at home later.

Figure out some adult communication, and make an attempt to love your husband instead of controlling him. He passed out. That could be something serious.
