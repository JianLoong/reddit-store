A lot of people were quite validating, but I think the response was overall too dramatic, but that's the internet I guess. The one comment calling me the asshole really stuck out to me though so I reached out to apologize and she invited me to her new years party to, in her words, \"Start a more casual friendship.\" I had nothing to do last night and I figured I'd go since her place was a small walk away.\n\nWhen I got there it was packed with people which already isn't my scene, but there were only a couple of hours until midnight and I could steal some chips and people watch for a while. I was there for about an hour before I saw my ex. She pulled me away to her room and she thanked me for coming, told me to enjoy myself and gave me a drink.\n\nNow I don't really drink often, but I can handle my alcohol pretty damn well and always have. (the legal age where I'm from is 18 don't come for us.) I figured it was in my hand already and I didn't want it to go to waste. Now when I tell you that this drink was STRONG. I mean it. I could barely taste the mixer, it was horrible in the way only straight vodka is. I ended up drinking it pretty fast so i didn't have to taste it all night, but that whatever. I'm rambling at this point, but it was a really bad drink and it got to me fast.\n\nAround 11 random people start coming up to me asking if I'm her Ex and if i still like her and what it was like to date her. Everyone and their cousin was interested in her and I's relationship suddenly and eventually someone let it slip that she was planning on kissing me at midnight.Now it was probably just a rumor or someones drunk idea of a prank but I decided I was done for the night and would rather just watch Animal Crossing fireworks so I texted her that I had fun but was leaving.\n\nToday I woke up to a million texts from her saying I shouldn't have left, that I should have spent the night if I was drinking, that it was rude to leave without a proper goodbye, that no one can leave New Years parties before midnight, and that I need to go apologize to her and her sister.\n\nAITA for leaving early? I know it was probably dumb to walk home while not fully sober, but it was just a few blocks and I'm fine, right?\n\nEDIT: I did not expect so many people to respond to this, and not as strongly as they did. To clear up a few things she and I don't talk often because I ghosted her after we broke up, I was at the party as an apology for doing so more than anything. I don't really plan on keeping too much contact with her after this, I just figured it would be better to clear the air in case I ran into her or her family. \n\nI still don't think the drink thing is that serious, but you guys are right that it was weird that she planned for me to stay overnight. \n\nOverall you have given me a lot to think about, I guess", "created_utc": 1704172463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18whdv4/aita_for_leaving_my_exs_new_years_party_before/", "score": 205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn't some formal situation like being presented to the King or something, it's a casual party at someone's home. \n\nI know you're brushing off suggestions she was planning to get you drunk and ravish you, but at the very least, it could've been really weird at midnight when a bunch of randos think she's going to do the NYE kiss--either she's going to demand a kiss and puts you on the spot or she doesn't try it and they all throw a fit out of disappointment. Then you will be the party pooper for not going along with everyone else's plan for you to have the big romantic NYE kiss with your ex who makes you feel unsafe.", "YTA, not for leaving the party but for everything else. Ghosting someone is really coward, you should have talked to her like an adult instead of vanishing first, showing up for the NYE party and disappearing again. She's confused bc you didn't talk things out. I bet she still has feelings and that's why she expected you to spend the night. She's not managing that in a healthy way, but you have not helped that AT ALL.", "NTA Good idea leaving her party before she went Bill Cosby on your ass.", "Well I assumed that one person asked her who I was and what I was doing there and it spread, and it's winter and the shortcut between our blocks is basically an ice rink this time of year and I didn't like walking back in winter when we were dating so I assume she didn't want me doing it drunk. \n\nI really don't think I need to block her, but I don't plan on talking to her, I didn't really plan to in the first place. I was just going to the party as a sorry for ghosting her", "They were mostly drunk gossips, I didn't even know half of them so I don't need anything like that", "Yeah, in the end it would have been awkward no matter what. I'm glad I left, I just wish it wasn't such a big deal?", "A trap wouldn't work if the intended victim could see it was a trap.", "What if she invited you, gave you a super strong drink, thinking it would be the first of many and get you drunker faster, kiss you a midnight to reignite the relationship and then invite you to spend the night **so she could take her shot at baby trapping you?**", "She's an ex for a reason (I assume), just cut contact and move on. I personally wouldn't even have gone to the party in the first place.\n\nAlso just imagine if the genders were reversed and a guy was trying to intoxicate and kiss his ex-gf, people would be coming at him from all sides and calling him the worst things.\n\nBlock her number and play some Animal crossing until you meet someone else. Her (and especially her sister's) feelings are none of your concern.", "I didn't want to make her look stupid. I hate to think I ruined her, and especially her sisters nights because I left without saying goodbye.", "That's a huge leap in logic here!", "I'm glad it's not just me thinking that everyone is focusing a bit to hard on the specifics. I really just wanted to know if I was rude for leaving so early, new years parties aren't really my thing so I wasn't sure", "And there's the perfect response to anyone who questions your choices on NYE.", "It's not reasonable to have one's night ruined by one person leaving the party without saying good bye or leaving before midnight.\n\nShe's having a big ol' reaction and trying to make you responsible for her feelings, but you don't have to go on the guilt trip. \n\nIf you respond, I'd keep it light. Hey, didn't know it was a big deal. Didn't feel great after that drink so I went home. \n\nYou aren't responsible for her planning something for you behind your back and you aren't responsible for the fall out when it didn't work.", "Yes it is. Here's the thing, how would your life change if this one-in-a-million possibility had transpired? It would not be the first time a single woman wanted a child, picked the nicest guy she knew and arranged a pregnancy. You would have been a father financially if not shared custody for 18 long years. It's unlikely but possible enough for you to guard against.", "Take it one step further.  She gets you drunk, takes advantage of you (sexually) and unless you had a vasectomy, she could possibly end up pregnant.  Think about that scenario.", "Mmhm \ud83d\udc4d", "Even so there is no evidence to that being the case here. It was one awkward party", "That's a huge leap in logic here..", "Not really? I was going as an apology of sorts because I ghosted her for a few months", "One awkward party where she tried to get you dunk and had told a bunch of her friends that she was going to throw a liplock on you and wanted you to spend the night. IDK if you have it in you to understand the implications of what was happening but I'm glad you got out when you did.", "Okay. Hmm. So you accepted her party invite as a goodwill gesture, to be friends? And you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re the AH because she went ballistic after you left the party \u201cearly\u201d/before midnight NYE countdown? \nAnd to clarify, you drank more than just the strong drink she handed you. You had a couple drinks? And you drank them of your own free will after knowing that at least one of them was a very strong drink because you could taste the vodka?\nIt seems like your ex is testing your limits and trying to guilt trip you instead of mending the friendship. Is this the kind of friend you want to keep? \nThat\u2019s all. She was trying to make you feel like an AH for leaving the party you attended because you\u2019re trying to make something up to her.\nHave I missed anything? I feel like I don\u2019t  quite have the whole story OP. What are you leaving out? \nAlso, saw your post about sleeping \u2014 good idea. Goodnight \ud83d\udca4", "It seems to be that the mistake you're making is feeling a need for \"everything to be OK\" for all parties involved. Not everything is OK, as she's not the right person for you and yet is pulling all sorts of weird tricks to try and get you two close again, and if she feels sad/hurt/angry/whatever in response to you saying something very reasonable, then that is _her_ problem, and not at all something for you to deal with.\n\nGiven how pushy she's being, I'd say you ghosting her is just the lesser \"climactic\" of only two ways of proceeding, the other being what is probably better in the long term for both of you, which is you spelling out a bit more clearly how she's overstepping boundaries and being unreasonable.  \nThe response suggested by /u/JSJ34 does that without being too confrontational.", "Bro why do you even care? She's an ex. Don't respond at all, block her number, and move on.", "You didn't \"ghost\" her - you were already broken up, and it sounds like you _tapered off_ communication (before fully stopping it) because she was over-stepping what was appropriate given you'd broken up and were supposed to be friends. Yes, I'm sure she'd have preferred a proper conversation getting into the weeds of each other's feelings, but you were under no obligation to give her that.", "Op is in denial", "I had one drink that someone refilled halfway through with something, though I think it was mostly mixer", "I just don't feel like this is a situation that needs any sort of conflict. Why *can't* things end up okay for everyone involved, you know?", "It was a bit rude of me. She was trying to be a good friend even though she was still interested in me, but when she brought up dating again, I just ignored her instead of talking it out", "Are you worried your drink was spiked?", "Because no one's perfect, and situations are often not perfect. You don't want to be in a relationship with her, but she doesn't seem to be able to accept that fact. The most ideal resolution is her realising that she can't have you and shouldn't be chasing you, but that in itself comes with some hurt on her part, which is just how life is sometimes.  \nThe only consolation is that that is better than the alternative - her pain being dragged out longer, if she's able to keep bringing you to what feels to her like within an arm's reach, and being disappointed each time when it doesn't result in getting you back together (along with dragging down with her too, when you're made out to be the bad guy each time).", "She was not interested in being a good friend, she was interested in having you around as a backup once / if the guy she dumped you for dumped her, or maybe because he\u2019s already dumped her (or never got together with her) or maybe couldn\u2019t handle that after the breakup couldn\u2019t handle that you weren\u2019t fawning over her. \n\nThe fact that a) she took you into pulled you into her bedroom for \u2018a private talk\u2019, b) gave you a very strong drink, c) let *everyone* know you were her ex, to the point of asking somewhat intimate details about your relationship, and d) let various people know she\u2019d planned on kissing you at midnight (which is usually reserved for your romantic partner), shows she absolutely did not want you for a \u2018good friend\u2019, best case is she wants you for a FWB. The whole \u201clet\u2019s be casual friends\u201d and inviting you to this party was a setup, and the fact that you woke up to all those texts, when you just left a crowded party of someone who was purporting to be \u201cjust a casual friend\u201d makes it really obvious to me that there was a lot more going on inside her head about where she thought things would be going with you on NYE (and after). \n\n\nAnd where was the guy she dumped you for in all this? At they still together? Was he at the party? Heck, did they ever even get together?From your previous post \u201chad someone online she was interested in\u201d sounds like she broke up with you to shoot her shot, in the intervening time it didn\u2019t work out, and she\u2019s decided that being with you is better than nothing, which never feels good. \n\n\nI\u2019d say keep passively ghosting her, and live your life.", "Not really. I've had a drink spiked before and it wasn't anything like that, though I admittedly don't know much about the drugs people do that stuff with"]}
