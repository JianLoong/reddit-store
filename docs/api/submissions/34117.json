The one comment calling me the asshole really stuck out to me though so I reached out to apologize and she invited me to her new years party to, in her words, \"Start a more casual friendship.\" I had nothing to do last night and I figured I'd go since her place was a small walk away.\n\nWhen I got there it was packed with people which already isn't my scene, but there were only a couple of hours until midnight and I could steal some chips and people watch for a while. I was there for about an hour before I saw my ex. She pulled me away to her room and she thanked me for coming, told me to enjoy myself and gave me a drink.Now I don't really drink often, but I can handle my alcohol pretty damn well and always have. (the legal age where I'm from is 18 don't come for us.) I figured it was in my hand already and I didn't want it to go to waste. Now when I tell you that this drink was STRONG. I mean it. I could barely taste the mixer, it was horrible in the way only straight vodka is. I ended up drinking it pretty fast so i didn't have to taste it all night, but that whatever. I'm rambling at this point, but it was a really bad drink and it got to me fast.\n\nAround 11 random people start coming up to me asking if I'm her Ex and if i still like her and what it was like to date her. Everyone and their cousin was interested in her and I's relationship suddenly and eventually someone let it slip that she was planning on kissing me at midnight.Now it was probably just a rumor or someones drunk idea of a prank but I decided I was done for the night and would rather just watch Animal Crossing fireworks so I texted her that I had fun but was leaving. \n\nToday I woke up to a million texts from her saying I shouldn't have left, that I should have spent the night if I was drinking, that it was rude to leave without a proper goodbye, that no one can leave New Years parties before midnight, and that I need to go apologize to her and her sister.\n\nAITA for leaving early?

No, she wasn\u2019t coming from a good place with any of this. Please consider cutting contact, that sounds so incredibly unsafe.

She\u2019s just trying to pull of her plan, albeit modified now", "NTA at all! It sounds like you were getting overwhelmed and so you left. Nothing\u2019s wrong with removing yourself from a situation you no longer want to be in. Also though, you only had one drink and it made you like pretty drunk?? That seems kind of sketchy to me for someone that can usually handle their alcohol\u2026. And don\u2019t want to speak bad on your ex but it sounds like she\u2019s always trying to make you the bad guy and have you apologize to her for something.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she wasnt over you and planned to get you drunk so she could have her way with you, (not in the sexy way, but in the predatory way because she planned for you to be drunk and have you stay the night without telling or asking you.)\n\nYou have every right to leave whenever you want and there are no new years eve party rules, she just pulled that out of nowhere to guilt you.\n\n\nBullet dodged and dont accept anything you can ingest from her in the future, because based off the other posts you wrote about her she sounds needy/clingy and desperate for love", "NTA  - she\u2019s just mad that she didn\u2019t get her way. Unless you were falling over, there\u2019s nothing wrong with walking a few blocks to your home. \n\nMaybe she needs more space from you to let go.", "NTA. \n\nYou're absolutely in the clear. One drink and walking home is totally fine. Even though it sounds like it was stronger than it ought to be. It seems as if your ex had all sorts of ulterior motives regarding this party. And her plans backfired. It's sketchy af.", "I\u2019m not trying to be overdramatize here but I can\u2019t mince words.\n\nThere is a reasonable chance you avoided an attempted rape situation. Or some kind of sexual assault.\n\nIt\u2019s not for sure, but it really comes across like she was trying to get you wasted so she could take advantage of you. It\u2019s possible that wasn\u2019t the case, but either way it was smart to remove yourself.\n\nNTA", "Dude\n\nShe was trying to get you drunk so she could kiss you \n\nThat\u2019s borderline SA\u2026 I know you might not think so, but that\u2019s such a messed up thing to do to someone. You 100% did the smart thing by leaving. Avoid her", "I read the first post. OP, you are from place where individuals have freedom chose their own relationships. The fact that you decided to start a relationship with her because you felt pressured or that it was expected is wrong. I am assuming that is also the reason why you didn't/couldn't set boundaries when she broke them so fast.\n\nPlease work on being more assertive. Point blank tell her you don't want any kind of friendship or relationship with an ex and cut her off. She will most probably do some stalkerish shit.

I don't think she had good intentions with that drink. Also all those people getting involved in your business made me think that they were in on it too. Fuck those guys.", "Isabelle put on a wonderful display", "That's what my sister keeps saying, but I really don't think it's like that.", "She's just really sensitive. she takes things the wrong way a lot.", "That's a bit extreme? I mean, I haven't had a proper drink in a year or so and it's not like she is going to drug me or anything.", "I doubt the entire party was held so that she could see me, if that's what you mean by ulterior motives. She just loves parties for every occasion", "I really don't think it was that serious, i probably shouldn't have brought the drink up at all I don't know why everyone is focusing on it.", "SA is a bit far. It was new years and we used to date, and even so nothing happened.", "She's bad with boundaries, but I would hardly call her a stalker. Clearly I'm not the best with relationships though", "it wasn't exactly the proudest of breakups, but I doubt we are ever getting back together. Especially after this", "I hardly knew any of them, I doubt they were \"in on\" anything. There was one girl that refilled my drink at one point, but it completely slipped my mind because I didn't know her. It was just a drink, I shouldn't have mentioned it I guess everyone is focusing so hard on it", "I understand not wanting to jump to the worst-case scenario, and none of us can make a definitive judgement on what her intentions were especially without knowing the full situation, but what you\u2019ve described does sound concerning (giving you a highly alcoholic beverage and planning to make a move when you had not expressed any interest in that). If you don\u2019t want to or can\u2019t completely cut contact I would definitely recommend being careful and only interacting with her when people you trust are present.", "That sounds like an exhausting person to be around. To always have to walk on eggshells so you don\u2019t say or do something wrong.", "Or maybe she's just gaslighting you and explains it away 'because she's so sensitive.' You asked for our advice, and those of us who've been around the block a few (million) more times than you are giving it.  Please take it to heart.", "Is this the same woman who invaded your privacy and went thru your personal things without asking? The same clingy woman who tried to move in with you after a month? She \"dumped\" you as an attempt to get you to want her again and then was trying to get you back.\n\nSeriously this woman is chock full of red flags\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "No. I'm sure the party was always going to happen. I mean that, by your own words, she pulled you away into her room, and gave you a drink that, also, by your own words, was horrible like straight vodka. She intended on kissing you at midnight, intended on having you stay the night, and when you left early, you were harrassed and expected to apologise. None of that is okay. \n\nIf it helps, look at it as if the genders were reversed. A man isolating a woman and putting a very strong drink in her hand with the intended plan of kissing her and having her stay the night? \n\nEven with the genders as they are, it's not okay. She did something wrong, and is upset with the fact that her plan to have you stay the night failed. She's painting you the bad guy. And you're not. You were in a situation where you were not comfortable, and you removed yourself. You have done nothing wrong.", "I said stalkerish. She's already doing it. This is not being bad with boundaries,. She doesn't give a shit about boundaries.  She wants what she wants, what you want is irrelevant to her.\n\nYou seem chill about being so drunk. All of us here think it's shady. It reads like she was planning to drug you and then assault you. You then believe her, when see says you are rude for leaving a place you felt uncomfortable in. Don't worry about whether you were rude. Worry about why you think that her planning this shit is trivial. \n\nMy friend, I would suggest you find a psychologist to build on some skills for your own sake. Don't write off yourself as bad with relationships. You seem to have issues holding on to your boundaries and being assertive.", "Normally she's with one of her siblings at all times (they can drive and she can't) and they are good people. Judging by the people at the party all the drinks were highly alcoholic so I doubts its this targeted/planned out thing everyone is suggesting", "NTA\n\n\u201cThanks for the NYE party invite. Confused at texts you sent after. I\u2019m single, I made no promises.  I  can leave a party when I want to, cheers\u201d", "I guess... I just think the internet can be overly dramatic, especially because I made this post while really stressed and hangry, you know?", "When you put it that way it sounds bad, but she's a really nice girl shes just a bit too intense for me", "I'm painting her in the worst light by only bringing up the bad things, and putting it all in a bad light. Though i get what you are saying, i'd never do that kind of thing to a girl", "I get what you are saying, but is this really something to bother a psychologist with though? They have real clients to worry about", "Yeah I have no idea how to respond. I'm putting it off until tomorrow lol", "I'm sure she's got some fine qualities. But all those qualities are irrelevant in this particular situation. And in this situation you are NTA.", "People like you (and me, I have similar issues) ARE the real clients that need psychologists. I wouldn't go to any therapist. Going to a proper psychologist, they can provide better tools for us to develop certain skills to be well adjusted adults.\n\nYou think this is not an issue. It wouldn't hurt to have better life skills, no?", "u/JSJ34 just told you how to respond, and it was perfect. Say that.", "maybe you are right i dont know why this is bothering me so much", "Not sure she would take that the best, but i'll probably steal most of it", "She\u2019s hassling you for leaving a party when you wanted to and were no longer having a good time. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t care how you feel\nSo Why are you worrying about how she would feel to innocuous words? \n\nYou\u2019re single \n\nYou\u2019re not dating her\n\nYou can do what you want when you want-  and you can most certainly leave a party when you want to go home", "I just don't want to make it into a big deal with her, she works right next door to me and I don't want it to come up there where we are more likely to see each other I guess"]}
