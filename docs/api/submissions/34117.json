She doesn't give a shit about boundaries.  She wants what she wants, what you want is irrelevant to her.\n\nYou seem chill about being so drunk. All of us here think it's shady. It reads like she was planning to drug you and then assault you. You then believe her, when see says you are rude for leaving a place you felt uncomfortable in. Don't worry about whether you were rude. Worry about why you think that her planning this shit is trivial. \n\nMy friend, I would suggest you find a psychologist to build on some skills for your own sake.

From your replies to other posters it seems you may still be interested in her or you would not have gone to a party where you don\u2019t know anyone else and be defending what are obviously not subtle plans to try and seduce you. You are both still young and hormonal. \n\nIf you seriously are not interested in perusing a relationship with her (and sounds that may be the best option) then cut contact.

Plus, all the others coming up and asking questions about if you still liked her etc just before kiss time is really weird to me. It's like everyone was in on the plan and you leaving made her look stupid at her own party.", "It certainly sounds like you got out of an extremely bad situation there. \n\nInfo: Did she know you can hold your alcohol well?", "Reverse the genders. A guy deliberately invites his ex to a party, pulls her aside where no one else can see, gives her an unusually strong drink, then lands a kiss on her *in public* without consent. That isn't even borderline, it *is* sexual abuse. What was her plan after that kiss? You shouldn't give her a pass because she only *planned* this and didn't get to see it through, that's not how these things work. She planned to assault you, she took every step in that plan, the only reason she didn't go all the way is because you left. \n\nYou seem determined to downplay this. For your own sake and the sake of men everywhere, *don't*. This is why sexual abuse against men isn't talked about. Men are expected to just brush this off without a care.

Being so defensive trying to protect someone can make other comments feel like they are attacking you. Like arrows hitting a shield. Getting some rest and coming back is a great idea.

In the end if you do cut contact or go low contact what is the worse that happens?", "The thing is, she gave you a strong drink in private, you heard from others she was planning on kissing you, and she was very angry you left.\n\nThat all adds up to her trying to get you drunk on purpose to more easily take advantage of you. It\u2019s extremely suspicious. Even if it was not that calculated, it\u2019s still not a good look for her.", "Ghey", "Some animals need their beauty sleep", "No? I don't think I've ever drank around her", "Doing that makes it sound worse, it was probably just a rumor I don't even know if she knew people were saying it", "This I agree \u261d\ufe0f with dude needs help serious help because he keeps defending a girl that could have SA\u2019d him and he doesn\u2019t even see anything wrong and while i agree sometimes the internet can be over dramatic on things but this is not one of them take the advice they are giving you and stop defending the girl", "The worst that can happen is her showing up at my work and making a scene. I don't think she'd do something like that but it's the thing keeping me up right now, you know?", "I guess it was a bit odd that she had it prepared already, but still, everyone is taking this a bit too far I think", "Then personally to me it sounds like it was a deliberate plan to get you so drunk that you couldn't say no. I know it sounds like I'm jumping to the worst case scenario here but it's what happened to a friend of mine who attended a party. There was a girl who was completely in to him, he didn't return the sentiment. Lots of people kept telling him \"Give her a chance, who knows what might happen\". \n\nAt this party he got given a drink that hit way harder than he expected. He ended up crashing in a guest bedroom to wake up during the night with her on top of him.

Don't engage. She wants drama and interaction - don't give it to her.", "It does seem like everyone here agrees with one another, that alone is making me second guess every comment. Maybe I'm bad at taking advice", "I don't plan on seeing her very often. We haven't spoken properly in months which I'd why I really don't think she was planning anything. We aren't close at all any more", "I was only at the party in the first place to make up for ghosting her", "Yes, these are huge red flags especially considering the other things.\n\nAs someone else suggested, take a look at the situation with the roles reversed. Just because you're a guy doesn't make it any less creepy/weird.", "It's bothering you because you know, deep down, that something was \"off\" about the situation. It's instinct. Don't rationalize it away. \n\nYou don't owe her anything. Not an apology. Not an explanation.", "You don\u2019t have to do things to make your ex happy now.

Why do you feel like you owe her that? Curious.", "I assumed I was just overwhelmed by all the people I didn't know and meeting up with my ex. I didn't think it would be this whole *thing* that everyone thinks it is", "Being in a big group of new people might be overwhelming. It might be a reason you wanted to leave, but is it the part that still bothers you?\n\nMaybe she had this fantasy that you would kiss at midnight and magically get back together. Maybe the alcohol was part of the plan, maybe it was just NYE.\nI don't think the friends were trying to warn you as much as trying to encourage these Hallmark Movie shenanigans.", "Just tell her you weren't feeling well.
