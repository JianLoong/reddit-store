I brought her a lot of pastries from a bakery and she invited me over to her house and then I thought it went well but her dog kept trying to jump on me  for 3 hours and was really misbehaving. We then went to dinner with her boyfriend and I was basically third wheeling lol but she said she had a good time and we should hang out again. \n\nI then text her a few days after that I want to hike at another park with her dog. She confirms and then I text her the night before at 11PM and she immediately texts back and says she found a location to meet but I didnt confirm it. She then texts me at 12AM and says she cant sleep well with insomnia so she wants to meet at 2PM instead of 12PM. I was pretty busy studying and doing work so Thats why I didnt reply on time and confirm.\n\nI said ok thats fine ill see you there at 12AM but i still forgot to confirm the exact location. She then texts me at 12PM that she doesnt want to go because she didnt sleep well and it was \u201ctoo cloudy\u201d?? \n\nI texted her the day after and then she says she went to the same park later at 5PM with her boyfriend when she \u201cfelt better\u201d and i asked her why she didnt wanna go at first and she said it was because she didnt know where to meet up before since shes never been there before. \nAnyways I cant tell if I\u2019m in the wrong for not confirming the official place to meet exactly or if shes just acting rude for going to a park I introduced her to and going with her boyfriend the same day we were supposed to go\n\nShe doesnt even apologize or ask to hang out again or reschedule. She straight up just went with her boyfriend instead and no plans of anything else together", "created_utc": 1667255641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yir3ck/aita_for_not_confirming_location_to_meet_up_the/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
