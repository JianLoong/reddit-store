As someone diagnosed with anxiety who has other family members who've also been diagnosed, I can tell you it does not affect our ability to wash dishes in our own homes.", "I mean, NTA for trying to force equality in the house, but you do realize that YOU are re-emphasizing that patriarchy you reference when you help your mother pressure your female sibling into housework but don't have the courage to demand the same from your father?", "It absolutely is, but I can\u2019t change my parents\u2019 cultural values & with inflation and the economy where it\u2019s at, I have to follow the household rules or be homeless. My mom picks her fights with my dad as is, so there\u2019s no net benefit to me chiming in", "We have tried this strategy to varying degrees. My mom has told her to do dishes or not use them in the past, and my sister has called that abuse for telling her to not eat. There\u2019s no way to really enforce rules about food in the house anyways since there are always leftovers in the fridge & my parents would never leave her starving.\n\nHer own laundry is fully her responsibility but sometimes it piles up to a degree where we have to do it to be able to use the hamper. With her dishes we end up having to clean them to use the sink/cook; same situation with having to clear our dining table & shared bathroom for them to be usable.", "How is OP the pot if she helps around the house? Not seeing the connection.", "It\u2019s cultural and nothing I say or do will change how my dad acts. I have plenty of friends with similar immigrant fathers who will not change. My mom has made demands from my dad in the past & they have had multiple marital arguments over it. I used to chime in with those demands as a kid but it never resulted in any productive change. Tbf my dad does pitch in significantly financially & takes care of house/lawn maintenance, so he contributes in in his own way", "Well then your parents have to tell her to get a job and pay like this for her living there as well as a few for you to clean for her.

Take privileges away etc.", "Get her her own laundry hamper, and her own cheap plastic dishes to use. Make her responsible for her own things. If she leaves her dishes out and doesn't wash them, they go in her bed (or whatever the most inconvenient place is). Cut off phone/internet access, provide it in exchange for chores like you would an allowance.\nOf course, this is all moot if your parents won't enforce it.", "NTA. You're calling it as you see it; your sister **is** a burden.\n\nHaving anxiety is no excuse for being a freeloader. Everyone feels anxiety from time to time. BTW, you don't have to clean up after her. \n\nWhen my daughter (who I love dearly) was in high school she suddenly became incapable of picking up, cleaning, or doing anything around the house. I put a huge box inside her bedroom and anything that she left around the house I dumped in the box. Books, papers, stuffed animals, snack wrappers, clothing, you name it. When she asked \"Where is X?\" I would tell her to look in the box.\n\n I didn't want to nag and argue with her and I also didn't want to live in the trail of crap she left all over the house. She moved out at 18 and we have a very good relationship now, 9 years later.  Good luck.", "the point is no one should have to take care of an 18 year old. that is not a child. sure, its barely an adult but it certainly doesnt mean you cant help out or pick up your own plate for goodness sakes. most kids start helping out with little things before 10. it being her sister with anxiety does not mean shit! calling her a burden isn\u2019t nice but she\u2019s 18 and does lower than bare minimum to clean up after herself. \n\nthis is certainly not YTA and barely even ESH.", " Like I said there is probably some that happen the sister doesn't know about. Causing depression and anxiety's. The sister needs to lay off. If she had issues she should tell the parent and just stop doing the chores.", "they didnt think out their reply", "ur speculation is certainly not how life works. if the sister lived alone she wouldn\u2019t be able to forget about chores. everything would be a shit show. depression or anxiety doesn\u2019t mean u stop living or stop cleaning up after yourself. this is coming from someone with mental health issues that has to still get up everyday no matter what. moms all over still have to struggle through ppd and sicknesses to care for their kids. \n\nOP is fed up of being the only one maintaining the house besides her moms help. thats fine. OP is NTA", "I have I've stopped living due to depression.i stop clean stopped working an starved myself and became homeless.some more serve that others. That is functioning depression.

I explained that it came from a place of frustration on my end & she said she would try to be more active with chores going forward.

Sister does not.", "I will admit I have been petty and often dump things she leaves out (used towels/dirty clothes/makeup/toiletries) in our bathroom on her bed when tidying. It\u2019s a small bathroom and there\u2019s no storage space for me to place her stuff elsewhere. Unfortunately her behavior hasn\u2019t stopped or reduced from me doing that. She sometimes gets snarky about me disrespecting her belongings, though I\u2019ll reply that she\u2019s disrespecting shared space. Maybe being more consistent with dumping literally everything she leaves around the house would help get the point across better.", "To add on to this sometimes if the pile of her stuff gets high & she doesn\u2019t want to deal with it/is upset because of it she\u2019ll sleep in our clean & empty guest bedroom. The room can\u2019t be locked & my parents don\u2019t want to physically drag her out so she essentially ignores the problem this way when it\u2019s convenient for her.", "I definitely could see my sister potentially having another underlying issue like depression given her general lack of motivation to clean/maintain living spaces & fact she sleeps in a lot among other signs. I can\u2019t read her mind though & she doesn\u2019t share what\u2019s going on with her mental health status/care with any of us for us to support and/or accommodate her. It is draining to clean up after someone who does not ever help/give back in return without being told to do so. As long as I can remember she has had an issue with cleaning/chores."]}
