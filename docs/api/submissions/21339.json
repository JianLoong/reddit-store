Take privileges away etc.", "Get her her own laundry hamper, and her own cheap plastic dishes to use. Make her responsible for her own things. If she leaves her dishes out and doesn't wash them, they go in her bed (or whatever the most inconvenient place is). Cut off phone/internet access, provide it in exchange for chores like you would an allowance.\nOf course, this is all moot if your parents won't enforce it."]}
