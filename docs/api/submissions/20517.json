You have no idea what it feels like, so don't think I'm an idiot. He was extremely abusive when I \"accused\" him of cheating. Blinders.. Kids meant more.

He has told people it's mutual. It's not. I posted because I want to not feel ashamed anymore. I'm done hiding from the asshole that gave me divorce papers for Mother's day.

You\u2019ve been asked multiple times why you and your children will not be going why not give the whole story in one post? I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like your dirty affair on Facebook?

I truly pray you get the peace and healing you deserve.\n\nThat being said, you cannot air out your dirty laundry and expect to look like the innocent party. It may feel good, but it will just make you look crazy and bitter. In addition, now it will look like your ex had a reason to leave. May I suggest journaling how you feel? It is free, therapeutic, and non-judgmental. Good luck.", "I get why you wanted to air the dirty laundry but YTA. Your N T A for telling everyone but putting the whole sordid affair on social media means the kids will read the details at some point. \n\nIts enough for a kid to know their parent had an affair.

May as well just put it out there and be done. Now I can not feel ashamed and hiding for his actions.", "This is how I look at it. Now. I'm done hiding. I'm finished being afraid to go over it all whenever I go out, or with friends. I'm done being controlled by his choices.", "The kids don't want anything to do with him. Not because of me. Because of his actions. His affair partner was a HUGE part of their lives. She was my children's only \"family\" closet. They know that he still works with her.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 Indeed I do. I have a dark sense of humor and a huge goof.", "So is Reddit \ud83e\udd23 seriously, though. Tame version on SM. Vent session on here. I appreciate your honesty. Thank you! Really, though. Not sarcassam. Thank you", "She was literally an everyday person in their life. For 10 years.", "How are you doing now? I remember when FB first came out. It was a little iffy moving from MySpace.", "Thank you for your response. Just one thing. His affair partner was family to them, in our home multiple times a week for 10+ years. From ages 1y/o and almost 3y/o.", "I completely understand! And, let's be honest, where would we be in life without a little social media drama now and then?\nOn a serious note though, I get it.

If they didn\u2019t want this public they should\u2019ve never done it and they know that. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you wishing nothing but the best for you and your kids future!", "You still want to lock down the custody agreement if he does get visitation.  If he's willing to gaslight you, he learned it from somewhere and as they say, the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree.", "Yes, but instead of venting to strangers, it may be better to work it out with yourself. Obviously, your choice, though", "They know. They are teenagers now.", "I'm fine now. This was a long time ago. Before MySpace by a ways...lol. But I would have loved to  put my ex on blast for getting knocked up by my best friend while we were in a 1.5 year relationship.  But I'm petty AF", "Until I finally had physical evidence. They are teenagers now", "That's irrelevant. No matter what they've already been forced to deal with in their lives it doesn't make it okay for you to continue including them in you and your ex's adult relationship nonsense.  They have two parents - you hate one of them - it's not fair to them to have to deal with your hatred of their father.  And if you think they're on your side or that they fully understand all that's happened in their lives you're wrong.  They're kids.", "You said the kids already knew about affair. What do they think of \"dad\"?", "I did an extremely tame version for FB. Because yeah. Social media sticks. I'm old enough to know that!", "Soooo many pretty mushrooms!! At many different times during the day! The same shroom can look totally different 2 hours later!", "Thank you, random late night internet browser. \ud83d\ude09 I honestly feel like he is more upset about being called out, publicly, for what he has chosen to do for years than what he has done to this family.", "When I talk to the kids about him. I talk about who he was to me. The way he was before her. Because that is the man I feel in love with. The man he became after his affair started was not him. They know what he has done because he made her so ingrained into this family. She was seriously my best friend for a long time. This was his choice to make her a part of this family.  They see that. They are not stupid.", "Yes. They are absolutely still kids. Both of them know that I love their dad more than explainable. I'm venting on here because I can't to anyone else. I have to suck all this up every day. Every fucking day. The post I made was one that essentially said, he cheated. He left.", "They knew we were trying to work through it. Him walking out was unexpected. They are confused and extremely hurt. He has been booted off the pedestal. Their, the kids, relationship has become tighter than before. They decided together to boycott Father's day. I ask daily if he's texted them or called. They know that I will never get in the way of their relationship with him. This is their decision. He's still their father no matter what."]}
