You\u2019ll grow out of the numbness. I never told my toddler sister I loved her when I was 17yo. Because it annoyed me that she needed to hear it so much. It was emotionally taxing. I don\u2019t want to say I felt \u201ctoo cool\u201d because that\u2019s not the emotion. It\u2019s more like \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered.\u201d Anyways, her existence wasn\u2019t a big deal to me the way it was to everyone else. I can\u2019t explain why. I just didn\u2019t care.

Quite frankly, I think it's weird of your mother that she blew up on you for not having the reaction she expected. Not like you said \"no he's not cute, he's ugly\" or something rude of that sort.

You can\u2019t just make yourself love someone, just like you can\u2019t just make yourself be excited someone new is in your life. And you shouldn\u2019t have to spend every day pretending to be excited to have a baby just plopped down in your life. For the most part, being a parent comes with a sort of ingrained connection and feelings of love. But it\u2019s not the same for siblings, especially with such a large age gap.

Little kids are super exhausting to live in the same house with, i know for a fact that i can't even try to feel anything better than irritation when my sleep schedule is wrecked. You help with baby chores and act with polite neutrality so i don't see why there would be a problem.

Raising kids can be incredibly difficult and annoying. Every time you woke them up at night, it was probably annoying. Spilled something. Lost something. Forgot something. Ruined something. Broke something. Wanted a ride. Wanted to be picked up. Wanted to have your annoying friends over. Made messes that you had to be told to clean up. Begged for something you did not need. Did not show appreciation when you were given something. Felt entitled, like you shouldn't have to be quiet in a house where you pay no rent. Asked for money. Wasted money. Lied (sure, you don't lie about your brother, but you have def lied to your parents before).

I have grown up, my entire life, numb and detached to children. I, like you, don't take it out on the children around me. I'm not enthusiastic about them, I don't want to care for them, I *have* done so before, but I fucking hate it. I hate it so much and I've never \"gotten over the numbness\" or \"detachment.\"\n\nI spent my entire life, to even just last week, being told time and again that I will \"grow out of it\" or \"regret not having kids\" and I haven't. I'm 22 years old. I've said I didn't want children since I was 5, but the biggest moment of me really making it a point, was when I was 8. I'm so tired of strangers, family members, and friends, telling me that I'll \"come around\" \"regret not having a family\" and \"learn/grow to want kids of my own.\" The comments are exhausting, draining, and to be told by those same people that I'm \"heartless\" \"damaged\" \"unempathetic\" \"cold\" \"inhuman\" and more? I'm *so done* and over those comments and character judgements that I read your response to someone's comment and went \"Yea. Checks out. I too am tired of people assuming I'll get over it when I haven't, when I won't.\" Even with the commenter sharing their experience, I read it as also being a \"you'll be like me, just be patient\" which is also aggravating.

My suggestion is to sit down and explain that forcing excitement and emotions when your life is being effected negatively isn't going to magically improve your feelings towards your new sibling. That you'll be an adult, and once you're able and willing, you'll have moved out and by the time he's old enough to remember you, you're going to be busy with work, school (if you want), and trying to live on your own/with non-family. You're not going to have time to adjust to his presence, be in his life, and grow attached to him. If you visit for holidays, you'll be cordial and help just as you are now, but you won't ever truly know and connect with sibling 17 years younger than you. What would you even talk about with him? Will you finally be able to have conversations with him 10 years from now? It's completely natural for children with such large age gaps to feel wholly removed from their siblings lives. You're getting ready to leave your family behind and start your own life somewhere else. Whether that's in the next year or five, you're working towards that, and now you have a sibling that you'll be leaving within that timeframe. Getting attached could lock you in and prevent you from growing on your own. Baby trapped, practically. Getting attached and leaving, will hurt so much more when you realize how hard it is to return to visit and be in his life.\n\nYou're going to be okay. Talk with your family, a d best of luck to you.", "NTA you might grow to like him but you don't have to and your parents can't force you either.

There is just a lack of love rn and honestly I get it.\nThe little boy is just a baby rn. He has not developed his own character and can't do anything besides sleeping and eating. So for some people it's hard to develop love for a baby since there is nothing much to interact with. \nParents may love their kids unconditionally but a teenage sibling going through major changes not loving their new brother right when he was pushed out of their moms vagina? god forbid the audacity...\n\nOP is helping out, treating the baby carefully and it sounds like they are not complaining much, if at all.", "I was already getting Soft YTA vibes from OP on the initial post, though it makes sense and is understandable that a young adult would be more detached from a baby sibling.  However, the coarseness exhibited towards your kind and informative reply cinches it, OP is an AH.", "No the commenter is saying her feelings towards her brother will change. They may. But they also may not. Just because one person grew out of that numbness doesn't mean OP will too.  \n\n\nI'm also guessing some of her hostility is that she's heard this before many many times over the past 6 months.", "Being told that is as annoying as a child-free woman being told \"you will definitely change your mind about wanting kids when you're older\". \n\nSome people change their minds, some don't. It's not necessary to tell someone what they will or won't do because people are different. It's not possible to force someone's emotions.", "Aw, I think it just makes her an angsty teenager.  (She\u2019s also kind of right. It doesn\u2019t work out that way for everyone.)", "I think it's assholery to tell someone \"you'll change your mind\" aka telling them how to feel. It's ok to say \"in my experience that changed later\". But \"you'll grow out of it\" is patronizing as heck.", "She's 17 holy give her a break", "No it doesn\u2019t", "that's a proper reaction to that comment. and I'm twice OPs age.\n\nsharing experience was the right call, not careful 'my experience tell's me everything about yours\" is not.", "All of my siblings are close in age, but I imagine it to be similar to meeting someone new. I felt the same when my niece and nephew were born. It's like introducing me to someone brand new and asking me if I love them yet. Uhh no?? I don't know this person \ud83d\ude02", "tbf, after being told repeatedly by the family that she should be loving this baby, i'm sure being told \"eh you'll come around to her\" is probably not a response she wants to hear after that, polite or not.", "I totally recognize this trigger of telling someone how you feel and getting a \"you'll survive\" back. it's minute, but it's an improper reaction to someone sharing emotions. \n\n\"I know how you feel\" is very different from \"I can tell you'll feel different\"", "Yes but the previous comment didn\u2019t say, \u201cand it\u2019ll be exactly the same for you\u201d. They were merely sharing *their* experience she she bit their head off.", "They didn't tell OP that they would definitely grow to love their brother; they said the state of numbness would wear off. That's a very neutral phrase, that implies things could get better or worse.", "She\u2019s 17 \u2026 and she came here asking for advice and bit the head off of the person with possibly the most relatable comment that wasn\u2019t even heavy handed.\n\nJust because someone is young doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t take critical feedback when they act obnoxious. In fact there was a time when humans thought of adolescence as *the* time to give critical feedback.", "At 17 I wasn't an AH like this. Shit, I was helping my older sisters take care of my nieces and nephews at that age. It's just her personality, has nothing to do with age.", "And sometimes they grow into a person you wouldn't choose to be friends with otherwise. I wouldn't like my sister if we weren't related (and vice versa) and I'm supposed to love her because we are? \"Civil\" is the best you're getting", "It did say \"You'll grow out of the numbness\".\n\nI understand the comment was meant kindly, but it's reasonable for OP to be offended by someone who doesn't know her at all telling her that she will grow out of her feelings of ambivalence towards her brother. It's quite similar to telling someone they will change their minds about having children when they are older. Maybe they will, maybe they won't, but it's presumptuous to assume you know more about their feelings than they do.", "Yeah that was such a weird response did they read that right", "they didn\u2019t say that word for word but they did tell her she\u2019ll grow out of it. op was rude but in all fairness the person was basically telling her what\u2019ll happen to her like it\u2019s a certainty.", "Because that person invalidated her feelings and essentially told her she was just immature and would grow out of it.", "NTA and this 100 percent. You can\u2019t choose who you are related too. And sometimes people/family just don\u2019t get along. You have clashing personalities. You don\u2019t hate them they are just someone you would not be friends with. And sometimes even family can be AH or bullies. Just because they are family doesn\u2019t mean you instantly love them.", "I think the issue is more with the perceived tone of OP's reply than the reply itself."]}
