I matched with this guy on hinge a couple days ago, we chatted a bit, exchanged numbers and eventually set up a date for tonight. 2 hours ago. \n\nI pull up to the address he gave me and he texts me that he was going to be a few minutes late. No worries. He calls me as he pulls in and finally tells me where we\u2019re going (he wouldn\u2019t tell me before just gave me the address of a shared parking lot). I was walking around a little lost trying find the place as we\u2019re on the phone when I hear him at the bar ordering a drink. Maybe I\u2019m dramatic, but if I can\u2019t find the place we\u2019re meeting at why aren\u2019t you trying to help me instead of going inside and ordering a beer????? Anyway red flag number one. Maybe number two since he wouldn\u2019t tell me where we were going in the first place. \n\nI hang up, I find the bar, I go in, I order a drink, and we sit down at a counter next to each other looking out on the pier. We make a little conversation, and very little eye contact for about 20 or so minutes, maybe even less, while we browse the menu. He was staring out on the water and would randomly say things like \u201cOh we\u2019re so lucky\u201d \u201cI love the water\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t this just the best\u201d. But he genuinely did not seem like he was enjoying his time with me. Did not try to ask me questions or make conversation, eye contact, he just didn\u2019t seem that into me. It was nothing super awkward, but definitely not vibing like we were on the phone. \n\n20 minutes in, he says \u201cI gotta go pee, if the waitress comes when I\u2019m gone you can order the appetizer\u201d. Fine. Except\u2026. five, six, seven, then EIGHT minutes goes by and he\u2019s not back from his tinkle. It starts to cross my mind that maybe he left? He had left his card down for the drinks when we ordered, so after 10 minutes I thought, well, at least I got a free drink, I\u2019m out. \n\nI walk back to my car and just as I put my keys in the ignition he texts me asking where I am.\n\nI told him, \u201c I thought you left so I did too.\u201d\nI said \u201cyou took 10 minutes to pee\u201d \nHe replies that \u201che didn\u2019t pee but ok\u201d. \n\nI call him and ask if he wants me to come back, he says yes, he\u2019s still there drinking his beer. \n\nI walk back and I sit down and he\u2019s fully engaged in the conversation with the woman next to him. Who also seems to be on a date. \nShe\u2019s a lot older so I\u2019m not assuming he was flirting. However, he didn\u2019t even acknowledge the fact that I came back. I sit there for 4-5 minutes on my phone scrolling Reddit while he continues to ask this woman questions and have a full blown conversation with her.\n\nSo, again, for the second time, I gather my stuff up, and leave.\n\nI drove home and got a text from him soon after that reads \u201cI went to the bathroom and was having a conversation so kinda think about if your reaction was justified..but thanks for coming \u201c\n\nWhich leaves me thinking\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1695791492, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tbldy/aita_for_getting_up_and_leaving_in_the_middle_of/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Admittedly, I\u2019m the type of person who finds everything rude so I\u2019m not the best judge. \n\nThe ordering before I got there or knew how to get there was weird, not making eye contact, not engaging with me in conversation at all really but being fully engaged with the lady next to you when I came back???

Girl, no.", "trust your gut!", "playing stupid games. if he is interested, this was a nice preview of a whole relationship where he tries to keep you off balance, makes you work for crumbs of attention, and blames everything on you. better to just decide he\u2019s not interested, he\u2019s not fun, and who wants to date a dude who smells weird anyway. nta, bullet dodged.", "I think you dodged a bullet good riddance", "If I were you I probably would\u2019ve assumed that he went to poop instead of pee and was just too shy to tell you.

Wtf.  What a weirdo. Never meet up with anyone who won't tell you where you're going.

He got off at 3 and was possibly running errands between then and now (7PM)? He wouldn\u2019t have a chance to use the bathroom for a few hours and definitely didn\u2019t have a chance to shower before the date. Maybe he had nervous shits and sweats, he didn\u2019t strike me as the nervous type tho. \nAlso, I feel like the smelly comment was so mean so many people are referring to it. \nI really like men who smell good. It\u2019s like in my top 3 first things I notice about a man. He didn\u2019t smell *bad*. He smelled like he left his laundry in the washer overnight and like maybe he worked all day. Not the end of the world.", "My best friend has IBS and has had to use the restroom at restaurants many times, sometimes it can take a long time. Not saying this was necessarily the case for OP but just replying to your notion that it makes no sense at all. There are plenty of people who have to shit in public restrooms.", "People with IBS who trigger poo from embarrassment or stress.", "I\u2019m perplexed by this too"]}
