I matched with this guy on hinge a couple days ago, we chatted a bit, exchanged numbers and eventually set up a date for tonight. 2 hours ago. \n\nI pull up to the address he gave me and he texts me that he was going to be a few minutes late. No worries. He calls me as he pulls in and finally tells me where we\u2019re going (he wouldn\u2019t tell me before just gave me the address of a shared parking lot). I was walking around a little lost trying find the place as we\u2019re on the phone when I hear him at the bar ordering a drink. Maybe I\u2019m dramatic, but if I can\u2019t find the place we\u2019re meeting at why aren\u2019t you trying to help me instead of going inside and ordering a beer????? Anyway red flag number one. Maybe number two since he wouldn\u2019t tell me where we were going in the first place. \n\nI hang up, I find the bar, I go in, I order a drink, and we sit down at a counter next to each other looking out on the pier. We make a little conversation, and very little eye contact for about 20 or so minutes, maybe even less, while we browse the menu. He was staring out on the water and would randomly say things like \u201cOh we\u2019re so lucky\u201d \u201cI love the water\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t this just the best\u201d. But he genuinely did not seem like he was enjoying his time with me. Did not try to ask me questions or make conversation, eye contact, he just didn\u2019t seem that into me. It was nothing super awkward, but definitely not vibing like we were on the phone. \n\n20 minutes in, he says \u201cI gotta go pee, if the waitress comes when I\u2019m gone you can order the appetizer\u201d. Fine. Except\u2026. five, six, seven, then EIGHT minutes goes by and he\u2019s not back from his tinkle. It starts to cross my mind that maybe he left? He had left his card down for the drinks when we ordered, so after 10 minutes I thought, well, at least I got a free drink, I\u2019m out. \n\nI walk back to my car and just as I put my keys in the ignition he texts me asking where I am.\n\nI told him, \u201c I thought you left so I did too.\u201d\nI said \u201cyou took 10 minutes to pee\u201d \nHe replies that \u201che didn\u2019t pee but ok\u201d. \n\nI call him and ask if he wants me to come back, he says yes, he\u2019s still there drinking his beer. \n\nI walk back and I sit down and he\u2019s fully engaged in the conversation with the woman next to him. Who also seems to be on a date. \nShe\u2019s a lot older so I\u2019m not assuming he was flirting. However, he didn\u2019t even acknowledge the fact that I came back. I sit there for 4-5 minutes on my phone scrolling Reddit while he continues to ask this woman questions and have a full blown conversation with her.\n\nSo, again, for the second time, I gather my stuff up, and leave.\n\nI drove home and got a text from him soon after that reads \u201cI went to the bathroom and was having a conversation so kinda think about if your reaction was justified..but thanks for coming \u201c\n\nWhich leaves me thinking\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1695791492, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16tbldy/aita_for_getting_up_and_leaving_in_the_middle_of/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was so bizarre. I feel like I\u2019m interrupting.

Atleast it was a free drink.", "NTA\n\nI decided on my vote when you came back to the bar. He was in the middle of a conversation with someone else and didn't even aknowledge your presence, that's very disrespectful and you were right to leave.\n\nAs an aside, were you interested in him at all ? Did you ask him any questions ? From the way you described the situation, I also get the impression that you were waiting for him to do everything and if you didn't do anything, maybe he thought you weren't interested. Which doesn't justify his rudeness.", "NTA, dude's weird, yo.", "NTA.  He had no interest in you whatsoever.  The ten minutes he was gone he was probably contacting other people.  I am guessing he was attractive and used to women putting up with his nonsense.", "NTA, sounds like you dodged a bullet.", "He demonstrated that he is capable of having a conversation, so yeah, he's at fault for not trying out this skill with you. ~~But were YOU trying to talk to him?~~\n\nEDIT: I just saw you comment where you said you started out that way. Never mind. How disrespectful of him. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He was rude and disrespectful to you. He left you hanging twice, didn't tell you where he was going or what he was doing, and didn't seem interested in you at all. You had every right to leave and not waste your time with him.", "You had a feeling and you just followed it. He was almost testing how much you\u2019d tolerate. He seemed emotionally unavailable and if this is how he is in public, you\u2019d be stuck with him having conversations with other people out with him again. My ex husband used to do this. It was rude and he would act like he was doing nothing wrong. Even as a married couple it was rude at times to ignore me for either a stranger or even at a wedding he once talked to the girl next to me all night. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA - he was super disrespectful", "NTA so I've thought about it and I think your reaction is totally justified.", "NTA.

Leaving after ten minutes is too soon. Maybe he needed to poo but didn't want to say it. Maybe he was nervous and needed a few minutes to compose himself. The point is, I think you could have given him a bit more time before getting up and leaving. \n\nMeanwhile he also seemed to be acting rudely so yeah, ESH but maybe him more so.", "I mean, what kind of dummy goes on a date when the person they're supposed to be meeting basically refuses to tell you where? I wouldn't have even went. So you don't even get to complain about that.\n\nWith that being said, do you just lack common sense? He left his card, he told you to order an appetizer, did you really think he was going to sneak out a back door? It was ten fucking minutes.\n\nESH", "Bullet dodged.

Then when he left for 10 minutes I really got that vibe.", "Yeah I\u2019m thinking the same ty", "He was very cute \ud83d\ude15", "Crazy because literally an hour prior we were texting and he was trying to convince me to go out with him. I wasn\u2019t into it until he called me and we got along so well on the phone conversation flowed smooth so I decided just to meet up with him. Then I show up and like you said, all conversation skills out the window. I thought maybe he thought I was ugly in person? Which was weird because I usually hear the opposite. The whole situation has me feeling like my spidey senses need a reset.", "It\u2019s funny because I almost left when he ordered a drink before I found the place. I hung up the phone and thought \u201cwhat a rude fucker you should just go eat by yourself\u201d but I keep thinking I\u2019m too temperamental and need to chill out. What I need to do is follow my gut. You\u2019re exactly right. I\u2019m glad you made it to the other side.", "I thought the same, so why text me after?", "10 minutes is too quick? The bathroom was 20 feet away and the place was super small. Should I have texted? I think I was a little embarrassed that I had been left on a date so just beelined it out of there as quick as possible. \n\nI\u2019m confused too whether he was rude. Admittedly, I\u2019m the type of person who finds everything rude so I\u2019m not the best judge. \n\nThe ordering before I got there or knew how to get there was weird, not making eye contact, not engaging with me in conversation at all really but being fully engaged with the lady next to you when I came back??? I feel all of those things are rude and I\u2019m so mad because he was SO HANDSOME and BUFF.", "It\u2019s a whole little \u201cvillage\u201d of places. He just wouldn\u2019t tell me which place in the village he wanted to meet at.", "Peace & Love ya\u2019ll are a little bit dramatic the address was the parking lot lmfao. If he gave me the address to the actual place I would\u2019ve had to drive back around and look for parking. Annoying that he wouldn\u2019t tell me which of the 5 restaurants or bars we were going to but the fact that he sent me the address to park at is his biggest green flag in my book.", "free drink covered the parking i guess then \ud83d\ude2d. hope your next date has better manners, goodluck!", "But he stank.  Girl, no.", "trust your gut!", "playing stupid games. if he is interested, this was a nice preview of a whole relationship where he tries to keep you off balance, makes you work for crumbs of attention, and blames everything on you. better to just decide he\u2019s not interested, he\u2019s not fun, and who wants to date a dude who smells weird anyway. nta, bullet dodged.", "I think you dodged a bullet good riddance", "If I were you I probably would\u2019ve assumed that he went to poop instead of pee and was just too shy to tell you. Either way I would\u2019ve waited more than 10 minutes, but I get the feeling that you were already a bit anxious at this point or put off by the red flags that you had already encountered. I\u2019m assuming your gut feeling was telling you to just get out of there and that this wasn\u2019t going to work out anyways. Hence why you weren\u2019t willing to wait longer than 10 minutes. I\u2019m gonna say soft YTA. None of us were there to really know what the vibe was like or what you were feeling. At the end of the day you have the right to end the date whenever you want but it\u2019s also not unreasonable for him to be annoyed.", "Yeah that's still a red flag. That \"surprise\" shit can be cute if it's someone you've met a few times before and have a baseline sense of if they're not completely insane. First date and they can't even be forthright with where you're meeting up? You're very lucky that this was what happened out of that.", "Yeah. So what? I wouldn't have went. It's fucking weird.", "Idk, its still super super weird. If he had said \u201chey wanna go to x place? the parking is weird so heres the address of where its best to park\u201d that\u2019d be one thing. But not saying the place you\u2019re going to at all is a huge red flag imo", "Yeah I really wanna call second date update to get his POV because part of me feels like there\u2019s gotta be a version of these same events where he doesn\u2019t look like a total asshole.", "I agree. It wasn\u2019t super questionable because it was like a pier with a bunch of restaurants, cars, stores, etc. I don\u2019t think I had any real risk of being assaulted or trafficked lol", "That is not the question nor the purpose of the sub. Thank you for the concern though, genuinely.", "Most people don't think they had any real risk of being assaulted or trafficked before it suddenly happens. Sometimes there's warning signs, sometimes there aren't."]}
