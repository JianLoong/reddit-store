I understand it\u2019s \u2018just a joke\u2019 to you but I don\u2019t appreciate it.

But really though, don\u2019t be afraid of offending these weird people. \n\nYou don\u2019t even have to bring it up, just ask them why they keep running ahead, and if they play it off with an \u201coh no reason\u201d then just tell them you assume they don\u2019t want to run together with you and you prefer to run alone. \n\nIf they mention the farting then just tell them you find it a weird thing to do. They deserve to feel awkward.", "..........wow, I...uh. NTA. this is unhinged behavior. Look, I get it. when you get moving, so do things. an accidental fart happens. but this is creepy, weird, strange behavior. they seem to enjoy doing this if the neighbors confirmed it too. You don't need to even be amicable about this. it's disgusting. ignore their offers to run with you, run on your own time or change your schedule if it's possible for you. if all else fails, run far, far away from these fart-fetish weirdos.", "NTA-  that is so weird and I hate to point this out but it\u2019s already awkward between you all.  I get not wanting to bring this up but you may want to find a way of putting it so the idea is off the table for good.

I've second hand embarrassment that they think its funny to do that.", "NTA\n\nI would try and run on the times where they are not available, but also have a handful of routes that you switch between so they cannot just join a run if they see you.
