At 21 I stole a lot of money from my parents (\u00a37k) and they didn\u2019t want anything to do with me, said as long as I never contacted them again then they wouldn\u2019t get police involved but never try and speak to them again. The rest of my family also followed through and I haven\u2019t spoken to anybody since.\n\nMe and my sister (20F) share a mutual friend even though we haven\u2019t spoken and when I told my friend about getting help I guess he told my sister. I got sent a facebook post made by my sister about me, saying that she was so proud of me for getting help and that it\u2019s so scary how much trauma I had given her, and how much I had hurt her and she hopes we can work through that. \n\nI was pissed at this because it\u2019s none of her business to share that online, like why not just reach out? And also my addiction has never actually effected her. We have never been close in our lives so she never saw me at my lowest and the most that I\u2019ve fucked her over is from the money. My parents have been massively fucked over by me, and I could understand if they said how much I\u2019ve hurt them, because I have but I\u2019ve never done anything to my sister. Like she literally used to make jokes about it to my family she didn\u2019t take it seriously at all\n\nI asked my friend if it was alright to speak to her and he said yeah so I sent her a message and told her what I said above. I said that she was never even there for me, and that she never even tried to understand me so she can fuck off with that post. She responded to me saying that she was just trying to be kind, and that my addiction did effect her and maybe if I stopped being so close minded I would understand that. She said that she shouldn\u2019t have tried to unblock me because I haven\u2019t changed at all and then she did block me\n\nAITA? I\u2019ve tried to ask my friend but he won\u2019t give me an unbiased answer since he\u2019s friends with both of us , and it just seems really embarrassing to try and ask anybody else.

You think it didn\u2019t impact her to see her parents worried sick, putting you into hospitals, robbed, and grieving having to cut you off, likely knowing it was at least in part to protect her? \n\nAddiction puts the blinders on but you do not get out of it without taking those blinders back off and taking full accountability for the impacts of your actions on others, direct or indirect. If you\u2019re still feeling like \u201cI\u2019ve suffered more than anyone, how dare they experience negative consequences from my actions,\u201d the tough love is you\u2019re still in a shit spot and need to make serious changes if you want your recovery to start going any better.", "My brother is a addict. He has been a addict for 10+ plus years. Between him going through my things to steal/pawn (which he absolutely has did), lying, and of course, the fear of him constantly ODing, it greatly affected the end of my childhood and my family, especially since he says he doesn\u2019t have a problem, doesn\u2019t need to go to rehab and can stop anytime he wants. It\u2019s very very hard to love a addict, and not enable them. I feel for your sister, because I am that sister too.\nYTA.", "As the daughter of an alcoholic (died 10 years ago), I'd say that your addiction affected your sister and other family members far more than you know.

All the same I wish you well.", "  YTA. \n\nAddiction effects everyone.\n\nMy moms an addict and I had to listen to her mother cry on the phone about it. \n\nEven if she wasn\u2019t involved with you, she was there to comfort your parents.", "YTA - Your self-created problem affected your entire family.

You get to use drugs, steal from people, alienate yourself from your family, and hurt others. You do NOT get to decide who you hurt and how much. This is your sister, part of the immediate family your addiction took a great toll on. Even if you didn't directly steal from her, or mistreat her intentionally, what if she was really concerned about you? What about the family trauma experienced by everyone? What about the fights over money, or her being unable to get school supplies or new clothes because you stole money from your own family and snorted it up your nose?\n\nAddicts are selfish, and you are no exception. Part of addiction is not realizing how our choices have affected others. Sometimes, we deny it outright.\n\nI would do some soul searching on this one and if you're in a recovery program, you can work on this within that framework.\n\nIf someone is claiming you hurt them, then you owe them the benefit of the doubt. Add her to your \"amends\" list. She didn't choose for her brother to become a drug addict, but she had to live with the consequences, as did your parents.\n\nOh, and congratulations on quitting  and I hope you stay quit.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSober guy.", "You don\u2019t sound like you are very far into your recovery. I think you will understand better once you are in a better place and have a clearer head. Your addiction puts a strain on everyone around you. Not only did your sister see your parents go through the pain of losing a child, but that could have made your parents change their parenting technique for your sister. And then there\u2019s the behavior you exhibit while high. Where you ever high around your sister? Did your parents spend a lot of time focused on your recovery and addiction and not focus enough time on your sister? Was there a lot of fighting in the household? \n\nI\u2019ll go ESH. Because I personally wouldn\u2019t use social media to rely such a message. If I did want to rely a message to my family member that I was happy and supportive of them entering recovery, I would find a more personal and private way of doing so. And while it is on the recovering addict to maintain their own sobriety, I still wouldn\u2019t want to add unnecessary stress. I feel like that post is a bit of attention grab. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone that found out their grandmother had died on social media (and my mother found out her mother) because people just can\u2019t stand to keep things off social media for two minutes because they want the sympathy and acknowledgment so badly.", "ESH.  I cannot stand people who put people\u2019s business out on social media so your sister is an asshole but man does this all read like someone who is not holding themselves accountable for their actions.  You could have politely asked her to take it down.  You betrayed your family and it\u2019s childish to think it didn\u2019t effect your sister.\n\nGood luck with your recovery", "I'm giving this one ESH because I agree with your point that your sister shouldn't have made the facebook post, which sounds overly dramatic and making it all about her, really not her place to make public. YTA for denying how much addiction can affect a family member, and not just the money part. I believe you're really trying to change, and I hope you won't let this throw you off track. I think you will see her side more as you continue your recovery. Sincere good luck to you.", "Your self-absorption is probably preventing from comprehending how the trauma you inflcited on your parents, would have had a trickle down effect on your siblings.  \n\n\nESH She shouldn't have made that post public.

It would have been reasonable for you to say something like \"I'm sorry for the pain I caused and hope to reconcile, but can we please work on it personally and not publicly. It was not at all reasonable for you to dismiss the pain you've caused her. If you're going to recover, you're going to have to accept that you've been living in a drug-altered reality for the last four years. As such, you're in no position to judge who you have hurt and to what extent. Even if you didn't directly  steal from her or abuse her, harming your parents was also hurting her.

The fact that she, as a teenager, masked her pain by making jokes about it, does not in any way suggest she was not hurting.", "ESH.  She should\u2019ve contacted you instead of a public post.

If didn\u2019t want to reach out directly, it probably would\u2019ve been best not to say anything (publicly) at all", "Or what about things they whole family had to sacrifice bc of the financial loss? 7k being stolen from my parents when I was in late high school would have had a large effect on what options would have been available for me as far as class trips, senior pictures, prom, everything is expensive and very few regular families can absorb a 7k loss (or the tens of thousands that rehab costs) without a serious tightening of metaphorical belt loops.", "My roomates bfs addiction affected me, to believe a family member isn't affected is ridiculous. \n\nI'll make it alot easier for OP by listing it and you can think if your sister experienced any of it.\n\n1. Watching someone I love suffer from loving an addict\n2. Physically picked her up when his addiction endangered her\n3. Seeing stolen drugs and knowing they are under my roof\n4. Watching a person die slowly before your eyes but having no way to contribute to their health because your not close enough to even do the minimum of being supportive.\n5. Picking up a person, you love because and addict has left them behind/ telling them its not their fault when an addict has to be left behind \n6. Trying to tell a person you love that there is nothing they can do for the addict\n7. Telling them its not their fault when an addict relapses after they cut ties.\n\nThat's in 1 year of living with someone who dated an addict, she lived with you, your her family.", "Absolutely right! My daughter is also in recovery (8 years), and she learned the value of owning her mistakes. She has spent every single day since rehab demonstrating her gratitude to us for helping and forgiving her. She apologized profusely and has consistently made amends.\n\nShe said that when she would sit in group sessions, everyone was tasked with stating aloud what they were most ashamed of stealing from their parents/friends/co-workers, etc. My daughter\u2019s response:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ashamed of the many things I stole from my parents, but the thing I feel most ashamed of for stealing from them\u2014is SLEEP.\u201d\n\nI truly hope and pray that OP can achieve a level of humility and grace like that.", "How do you think about the phrase that an addicted person who doesn't recognise these things is not actually sober or in recovery but just not actively using? And is it true that without these steps a relapse is highly likely? \n\nAlso how do you see the way OP talks about his recovery? For me it doesn't sound like he's actually sober but I might be misunderstanding this", "When I was single, drug or alcohol abuse was at the top of my list of red flags for even dating a woman casually and certainly not relationship material. Hard no with every one of them. I didn't care how much rehab they had, it was a hard pass.", "I'd award you but they are so expensive! \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "Jesus christ dude, really? You were a blood relative and you were kicked out and gone 0 contact with. Do you genuinely have no idea how straight up losing a brother would feel to her?", "You are unbelievably self centered. You stole from her parents. You hurt her parents. Therefore, you hurt her. She had to watch her parents grieve. She had to deal with the effects of your theft.\n\nJust because you have so little empathy you don\u2019t care about the pain of others doesn\u2019t make it true for the rest of us.", "Think again! You hurting and fucking your parents over had a massive impact on her. She watched them grieving and falling apart, saw how they eventually had to cut you off. \n\nShe's a victim of your actions like everybody else that was unlucky enough to know you.\n\nYou'll need to learn to take responsibility for your actions and the damages you have caused. Apologize to her.", "It absolutely affected her, and you need to accept that rather than try to pretend otherwise.  An addict completely screws up the family dynamics and often creates stigma in the surrounding community for the entire family.  Especially when they create a lot of financial stress.\n\nNot sure how you can think that you fucked over your parents but that wouldn't have had any spillover effect onto her.  It did, trust me.", "YOU don\u2019t get to decide if or how your addiction impacted and affected your sister.  YOUR SISTER gets to decide that.  Simple as that.  And if you can\u2019t see that, then you need to bring that up in your recovery program, because it\u2019s part and parcel of the problems that got you into addiction in the first place.\n\nYTA but I do wish you luck in your recovery.", "And what she never interacted with your parents about this? The fact is she did see you sometimes. Are you a mind reader? The fact is you can't possibly know for sure. YTA", "My dude, just because you weren\u2019t present in the moment when she was experiencing the trauma you inflicted doesn\u2019t mean it didnt happen. Peoples lives still exist even when you leave the room. \n\nYTA", "You stole 7K from your parents, you think that didn't affect the household? Your parents being stressed out?", "Hopefully when you\u2019re no longer actively addicted you can stop being so horrifically self centered and start to understand that not only does the world not revolve around you, but that your actions absolutely can and do affect other people whether you believe it or not.\n\nYou are hurting her family, including yourself.\n\nPlease get yourself into an actual rehab program and therapy.", "Dude you honestly don\u2019t know about ripple effects do you. All those times your parents were worried about you and putting in effort with you over your bad choices who do you think they overlooked. When you stole that money who do you think had to go without? You wonder why she doesn\u2019t want anything to do you with???? You did effect her and your selfish yea yta", "you don't get to decide whether it impacted her or not. how about instead of saying, shut up it didn't impact you at all, you ask her what she means? she clearly has a different perspective on your actions than you do", "Even if she doesn\u2019t care about you at all (I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case, but I\u2019ll play your game), your addiction has had a horrific negative impact on your parents and that affects her", "I think this is an interesting concept- my dad has abused alcohol and drugs my entire life and he went to rehab last summer. I\u2019ve been told he stopped drinking but still smokes weed. He bragged to me about completing the 12 steps in record time - weird flex, also I talked to my mom and sisters and none of us have been reached out to or apologized to. He hasn\u2019t tried to make amends at all. To me, he hasn\u2019t completed AA then. But that\u2019s not how he sees it.", "My stepdad that\u2019s been in AA for 40 years calls that the \u201cdry drunk\u201d stage of addiction. (He uses that term for any type of addiction though-drugs, sex, shopping etc.)\n\nYou still have all the addictive patterns, selfish justifications for harmful behavior and self-loathing that drove the substance use to begin with, just aren\u2019t actively using at that moment.", "Yeah? Listen I know you don\u2019t know my sister but trust me when I say we aren\u2019t close. She wouldn\u2019t even consider me her brother when I was in contact with her, she used to say she had no siblings when somebody asked her. Even in childhood we weren\u2019t close we never have been", "It sounds like your father did the 12 steps(or most of them because making amends is a big one) without actually participating or trying to better himself doing it. Addiction is a disease and most heavy addicts do not ever stop having cravings or having to fight that and in my opinion, \u201cCalifornia sober\u201d for heavy addicts is just a passing in their coping mechanisms and will eventually revert back to harsher substances as soon as they get stressed/depressed or whatever. Anyone bragging about completing AA clearly didnt pay attention because you will get chips for every year you continue to participate and you start to understand that even after 10,15 or even 20 years sober, you still are an addict and cannot safely consume substances.", "Some aren't capable of any self reflection or  able to deal with the fact they've hurt others. Or, just not care. Addicts are inherently selfish", "Why do you think she said she had no siblings? Here\u2019s a hint, she would not have said that if you had \u201cno impact\u201d on her. She said that because the impact of your choices and the fallout from your choices on her was too much. \n\nI have real sympathy with your point that your recovery was not her story to share on social media. But everything else here lands me solidly on a YTA verdict. I really hope that your recovery continues and that it eventually gives you space to see what you are denying so hard right now.", "You caused drama in the family. She is your family. Therefore, she was affected by your drama. When someone tells you you hurt them, you don't get to decide that you didn't. YTA.", "Ok but why can't you see that fucking over your parents also affected your sister? It doesn't matter that you weren't close to her, she had to watch as your parents were abused and mistreated until they eventually lost their son. How can you not see how this would affect her?", "Right. Because she didn\u2019t have a sibling, her brother disappeared into addiction and fucked over her family. \n\nYou were her older brother, you\u2019re blaming her for your bad relationship in childhood? Do you remember trying to build a positive relationship with your younger sister growing up? \n\nSheesh. YTA. Seek therapy. Seek help. Good luck.", "> trust me when I say we aren\u2019t close.\n\nI do trust you, because you absolutely fucked her over time and time again with your bullshit.  YTA, but hopefully you can be sober enough to realize it and then apologize to your family for making things difficult for them.", "I mean, that\u2019s pretty clear evidence it *did* affect her imo. You think she kept her distance for a reason other than your addiction? It\u2019s obvious the two are related; it was her coping mechanism", "Every time your parents had to focus on you, be it emergencies, money, finding you a rehab, or just plain worrying about you was time and attention that she lost. When you moved back in and continued to use, you upset the whole household every single day. \n\nShe absolutely was affected by your addiction, your whole family was. \n\nNow might not be the time to face that so early in your recovery so channel this anger and bitterness into things that will help you stay clean today and hopefully, down the road, you will eventually see it.", "I am 8 years younger than my brother and his addiction has very much affected my life. It has certainly kept me from being able to have him in my life as a trusting friend. I have to keep him at a distance. Whether you want to face it or not. It doesn\u2019t matter how close you think you are or aren\u2019t. Your sister has had to deal with the fall out and picking up the pieces that you left scattered. She has had her family broken up and deal with the consequences. You are only thinking from your perspective and not trying to really see it from any other. \n\nI will say from my experience how close you are, aren\u2019t or age gap does not mean she hasn\u2019t felt trauma from your drug use.", "You weren't close because you were an addict who LIED... STOLE.... AND BROKE YOUR PARENTS (AND SISTERS) HEARTS!\n\n\nIt is HARD to hear and believe but YES..... You caused your sister trauma.... And your parents.... And extended family.....\n\n\nYTA", "You don\u2019t see how financially screwing over your parents might have an effect on the available finances they had to raise her, a minor financially dependent on the people you acknowledge you screwed over?", "i wonder why", "And she still doesn't consider you her brother.  Nothing changed. And chances are good you will never be close...or in contact.", "Do YOU know your sister? Doesn\u2019t sound like it..so why do you feel you can speak for her or properly analyze her feelings?", "I'm not close with my brother either, but his addiction has affected my entire family. While he spent two decades being under the influence, I had the pleasure of being fully sober and witnessing how much it destroyed my parents to watch him spiral. You don't have to be close for your addiction to affect your family members. \n\nYTA.", "Who can blame her, you seem like such a treat.", "Yeah there is no \u201ccompleting\u201d AA. My stepdad started going in his early 20s and still goes in his early 60s although he seems to have taken on a more leader/sponsor/mentor role in the last few years."]}
