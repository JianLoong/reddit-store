I started recovery 2 months ago; not really going so great but that\u2019s fine because that\u2019s not what I came here today to speak about. \n\nSo my family haven\u2019t spoken to me for the past 2 years. My parents found out when I was 19 and begged me to get help and sent me to tons of hospitals and all that shit but I didn\u2019t, they also got me kicked out of university and I moved back in but they couldn\u2019t do much more than that so they eventually just left it and gave up. At 21 I stole a lot of money from my parents (\u00a37k) and they didn\u2019t want anything to do with me, said as long as I never contacted them again then they wouldn\u2019t get police involved but never try and speak to them again. The rest of my family also followed through and I haven\u2019t spoken to anybody since.\n\nMe and my sister (20F) share a mutual friend even though we haven\u2019t spoken and when I told my friend about getting help I guess he told my sister. I got sent a facebook post made by my sister about me, saying that she was so proud of me for getting help and that it\u2019s so scary how much trauma I had given her, and how much I had hurt her and she hopes we can work through that. \n\nI was pissed at this because it\u2019s none of her business to share that online, like why not just reach out? And also my addiction has never actually effected her. We have never been close in our lives so she never saw me at my lowest and the most that I\u2019ve fucked her over is from the money. My parents have been massively fucked over by me, and I could understand if they said how much I\u2019ve hurt them, because I have but I\u2019ve never done anything to my sister. Like she literally used to make jokes about it to my family she didn\u2019t take it seriously at all\n\nI asked my friend if it was alright to speak to her and he said yeah so I sent her a message and told her what I said above. I said that she was never even there for me, and that she never even tried to understand me so she can fuck off with that post. She responded to me saying that she was just trying to be kind, and that my addiction did effect her and maybe if I stopped being so close minded I would understand that. She said that she shouldn\u2019t have tried to unblock me because I haven\u2019t changed at all and then she did block me\n\nAITA? I\u2019ve tried to ask my friend but he won\u2019t give me an unbiased answer since he\u2019s friends with both of us , and it just seems really embarrassing to try and ask anybody else.

You think that all the time and stress they spent worrying about you didn't make them less emotionally available to her?

You get to use drugs, steal from people, alienate yourself from your family, and hurt others. You do NOT get to decide who you hurt and how much. This is your sister, part of the immediate family your addiction took a great toll on. Even if you didn't directly steal from her, or mistreat her intentionally, what if she was really concerned about you? What about the family trauma experienced by everyone? What about the fights over money, or her being unable to get school supplies or new clothes because you stole money from your own family and snorted it up your nose?\n\nAddicts are selfish, and you are no exception. Part of addiction is not realizing how our choices have affected others. Sometimes, we deny it outright.\n\nI would do some soul searching on this one and if you're in a recovery program, you can work on this within that framework.\n\nIf someone is claiming you hurt them, then you owe them the benefit of the doubt.

I feel like that post is a bit of attention grab. \n\nAnd this is coming from someone that found out their grandmother had died on social media (and my mother found out her mother) because people just can\u2019t stand to keep things off social media for two minutes because they want the sympathy and acknowledgment so badly.", "ESH.

If you're going to recover, you're going to have to accept that you've been living in a drug-altered reality for the last four years. As such, you're in no position to judge who you have hurt and to what extent. Even if you didn't directly  steal from her or abuse her, harming your parents was also hurting her.

He \"doesn't handle stress well\" because he's never bothered to learn other ways to handle stress (other than drinking, of course) so when our mother had cancer, he never once came to help.  I gave up my job and my home to move 6 hours back to move in with my parents.  I drove 40 miles to work, taught school all day, drove 40 miles back to the house, let the dogs out, fed them, changed clothes, got the dogs in, and drove 60 miles to spend the evening in the hospital with Mom so Dad could go home and get some rest.  I did that five days a week.  Weekends were a bit easier, but not much.  Dad had a stent put in a few years ago.  Brother wasn't anywhere to be found.  I'd moved five hours away so I drove back, stayed a couple of days, came back home, packed up my cats, and went back to my parents house for another month.  Dad had two pacemakers and a defibrillator put in last fall.  I didn't get back for that but only because I was sick myself and Dad told me to stay home.  Brother never offered to come.  Next year, I'll be moving closer to them just to make it easier to get there if they need me in a hurry because my brother...won't show up.  Since he refuses to do anything, when they die, I will have to clean out their house, handle their estate, and deal with telling their physicians my parents have DNR orders.  My brother doesn't think his drinking affected me, either.  Hell, it's still affecting me.  I tell you all this because you sound a lot like my brother. \n\nYour sister has my utmost sympathies.  You have my YTA vote.", "Wow! Just... wow! I understand that you are rather new in your recovery but this is so stupid!

I understand that addiction is a disease, and a really fucking hard one to get control of, and it seems like on some level you do want to do that so I don't think being harsh to you is necessarily the best way to support, but.. right now, YTA. It is incredibly naive of you to think that your sister would be completely unaffected - first of all, knowing and worrying that her brother was engaging in harmful and dangerous drugs. In addition to that, she was a dependent child of the parents that you stole \u00a37k from. Even if she didn't have to accept changes to her life after her parents lost such a large sum of money, it's going to upset her that they were the victims of this crime and that the perpetrator was their child and her sibling. You may not have targeted her directly but she is still a member of the family unit that you exploited in order to fuel your addiction. There's also the possibility that she is very aware of a genetic component that affects how much someone is likely to have addiction troubles which could make her worry that one day she'll be dealing with that and similarly hurting the rest of the family. \n\nYour sister is not at all some unaffected bystander. You might not have realised due to all the other stuff going on in your drug focused world, but she definitely was and is someone deeply affected by your addiction. You say you're at the beginning of a recovery process, and it sounds like you're still quite defensive about acknowledging the harm you did to those around you.

I will give you that. I don't personally think you should post about someone elses struggles online if you havent been given permission by that person. \n\nHowever, being an addict, probably did impact her.

My brothers problems ruled our lives from the time he was in about third grade until the time he died at 23 years old. I love my brother, and my heart is broken because he is gone, but I also have a lot of resentment toward his choices, and the way that my parents parented us.

Living in a house with an addict who acts like she doesn't exist - you think that wouldn't affect her? \n\nYou're minimising what you've done by trying to say only your parents were affected.

I think if they were 6 mos to a year in and still believing this way then there could be an argument for what you\u2019re saying but at 2 mos it\u2019s just trying to not use and learning about the disease.  If they are doing it on their own then I think for sure they don\u2019t know yet what they don\u2019t know, but they are likely still selfish and self serving which is common and takes time.  I have been sober in recovery for 5 years and I work my program everyday in one way or another and that includes regular self reflection because if we are not looking at our behaviors and how we are thinking, we cannot change and grow.", "I agree with this. My cousin was on and off of the recovery and never took it seriously until our grandparents threatened to cut him out of the family entirely.

I think this is partially right, in that I was drinking because I had emotional problems that I needed to address and heal so that I could stop leaning on alcohol. Part of that process was just recognizing how I hurt people and wanting to change my behavior so I wouldn't hurt people anymore.\n\nHowever, I think sobriety is sobriety. It's a process. It's good enough to just stop using the substances, even if you haven't dealt with all your emotional issues yet. It's hard to heal and get comfortably and healthily sober if you're still using.

Of course it impacts her. YOURE HER BROTHER. close or not she lives through your shit.", "I don't really agree with the last sentence. A person in active addition has very low limits of what they wouldn't do to get their fix which leads to selfish behaviour but it's not that every person with substance abuse disorder is inherently selfish. Most people who struggle with it started from a point of horrible physical or mental pain. People starting from fun getting out of control like OP seems to have done are rare. People with addiction disorders often have experienced trauma or have underlying health conditions such as chronic pain or mental health issues or got addicted to opiates thanks to irresponsible doctors. And once the substance isn't the foremost object in their brain anymore many people are able to reflect both on what let them there and what they did to others and seek help for the former and make amends for the latter (which can include leaving the people they harmed alone). But people that were selfish before addiction often stay selfish in recovery.

I would definitely describe it as a good relationship, despite it not being a close relationship.", "It's incredibly brave to open up about these things given how stigmatized they are (which is incredibly unfair, correct me if I'm wrong here but according to what I was taught during my education the percentage of people suffering from addiction that slid into it from a mere \"having fun\" that got out of control is incredibly low while trauma, untreated mental health issues and in the US a bad pain treatment from doctors not being careful enough make a high percentage of people developing an addiction disorder. Plus there's studies that show that if you are at risk for addiction depends on how your brain is built, something that's purely a matter of chance). But it's also very important to remove said stigmas and help people who are just uninformed but not nasty by nature understand why they're wrong and harming others. It's just unfair that people already struggling with such a disorder have to take this post of public education as well.\n\nThank you for being so honest, giving others the opportunity to learn and understand and for answering my questions and giving me valuable insight.

No. But she lost her brother all the same. Lost her parents at times too.\n\nIt's easier for you to make her feel bad then confront that there is more collateral damage from your addiction then you care to recognize.

So I ask my mom one day when I\u2019m 11 \u201cwhatever happened to cousin?\u201d Turns out the guy got in a bad motorcycle accident and got addicted to painkillers and later more severe drugs because of it, and that the reason only my Aunt visits is that the last time they left him alone in Florida when Aunt and Uncle came for my first communion, they went home to find their house a mess and that cousin had stolen and sold all their stuff to fuel a drug addiction, which hurt my already poor Aunt a lot.\n\nThis dude has been arrested and in jail so many times and my dirtbag of an uncle keeps bailing him out and despite all the times he\u2019s been to rehab over the past 15 years, and all the love and support everyone has given him, he just won\u2019t take it seriously and won\u2019t even try to better himself.

You don\u2019t know because you didn\u2019t *want* to know - and you still don\u2019t. That\u2019s what she means when she says you haven\u2019t changed.

Trust and respect are not re-earned overnight. \n\nSo, yeah. For now, YTA. I hope one day soon you won\u2019t be.

Your recovery is about you, and it sounds like your sister tried to hijack your lived experience, and make it more palatable to her. Bloody selfish if you ask me. Just focus on your recovery, making the changes that make sense to you. It's about you changing your life to be a life you can live authentically. That may or may not include some sort of reconciliation with relatives, but it doesn't have to, and you shouldn't be forced to.

I really hope you can find a good counselor to work through things yourself before you attempt to reconnect with the rest of your family. The level of self absorption in this post is horrifying.

I sincerely mean that, because not every addict seeks to recover. Kudos to you for taking that step. But you have a lot more to work on than just your addiction, that much is clear. Addiction is by definition selfish trait since addicts willingly hurt those in their lives (the monetary theft, for example), and in your case it has also caused you to be horrible to your sister when she was trying to be on your side by showing support.

I have one sibling that just can't get it right and I worry about her every day because she uses heroin/fentanyl.

No matter how you think your sister dealt with it, it's not the same as what she actually went through. Her feelings are just as valid as your parents' feelings. I'm sorry she put your business on social media for everyone to see. She should've messaged you privately. Talk to her about that and tell her how you feel about wanting to keep it private.

You don't have to agree with it, you just have to understand how she feels. \n\nAnd hopefully you're in some kind of a recovery or 12-step program. You need healing as much as your family. People don't just wake up one day and start using substances to the point where it destroys their life. You need to find out what drove your addiction in the first place.

But I also had a lot of other thoughts and emotions and was sharing them with my friends and getting the support that I needed in place in the high likelihood that the rehab failed and I was yet again hurt by it.\n\nThankfully, my dad is 14 years clean and sober, and no longer homeless. He still only has me a family, my siblings are younger than I am and unable to move past the years of hurt from childhood, which I absolutely do not blame them for and neither does my dad. And my kids are able to know their grandpa and really love him. \n\nHe is a completely different person than who I grew up with and I am so so fucking proud of him. But I'd be lying if I said that there still isn't a lot of pain there from his choices of drugs over family during my childhood and all the things I loved through, witnessed,pr protected my siblings from.", "I will, and thank you! She\u2019s had more trials and tribulations than anyone could imagine in their worst nightmares, but she still maintains her sobriety. She has lived with us since rehab 8 years ago. Her 7-year-old, my precious granddaughter, lives with us, too of course. My daughter waits tables 50 hours a week and makes us very proud.\n\nWhen people ask how she ended up a single mother without any support, she tells them that she was \u201cseduced and betrayed by a scoundrel.\u201d My granddaughter\u2019s bio-dad decided that being a junkie was a better way to spend his life (and continue to \u201chide\u201d from the police inside rehab facilities) than to man up and be a father.\n\nHer c-section with my granddaughter got infected and she nearly died multiple times over 10 days in ICU from Flesh Eating Bacteria. No emotional support from him. Broke her hip at work 18 months later. No support. Needed emergency hernia surgery (complications from the F. E. Bacteria) 1 year after that. This woman is my energizer bunny HERO! She keeps one foot in front of the other every day.\n\nGranddaughter has zero memory of him, and we\u2019re totally fine with that. He would have spent her life making promises and breaking them, and all around broken her heart. He was evading the police when my daughter met and fell in love with him in rehab. He preyed on vulnerable women; my poor girl committed the classic blunder: she gave her heart away to someone she met in rehab. She has counseled other women and used her story to try to prevent this from happening to them.\n\nAnyway, I apologize for getting carried away and rambling. I just wanted anyone reading this to know that it CAN BE DONE! Have a great day! \ud83d\ude0a", "Ugh. I\u2019m sorry.", "Your daughter should be so proud of herself. I know that it can\u2019t be easy. Wishing you and your family strength, positivity, and love.", "Congratulations on her strength and recovery! And thank you for being such an amazing support while she found her inner strength.", "No rambling that I can see.  Just an honest view of what your daughter has had to overcome.  I do like her explanation of how she ended up as a single mother!  I'm a writer and I may need to borrow that for a short story.  I wouldn't borrow her story, because it's not mine to write, but I love that explanation!", "ADDICTS ARE NOT SELFISH. ADDICT BEHAVIOR is. There is a difference. They are people. Not their behavior while using.", "Thank you kindly! Wishing strength, positivity, and love to you and your family \ud83d\ude0a", "Thank you so much for saying that. She is remarkable. \ud83d\ude0a", "That\u2019s so nice of you to say! I\u2019m afraid I must admit that I heard that fantastic line in the movie, Ronin. I have used it over the years because it\u2019s so succinctly brief, yet vague, and to the point. She and I would love to see someone write her story, as there is sooooooo much more drama and toxic nonsense from her ex (but not for the past 3 or 4 years\u2026maybe he\u2019s buried in potter\u2019s field? In jail? We don\u2019t care).\n\nThanks so much for your kind words of support. It makes me smile that you took the time to comment.", "Tomato, tomahto. As someone who has watched my sister hurt every single person in her life, I find it hard not to see her as astoundingly selfish.", "Very true, however this relationship between siblings seems to be both bad and distant.", "You need therapy; and it just may be your sister is an addict AND selfish! Both can exist. But, anyone I know truly working on recovery are amazing people.", "Lots of people do. That's not an insult. The fact that you just said that to a stranger so matter-of-factly makes it clear you do, too.", "I\u2019m in therapy, Alanon, and have done a lot of recovery work. I highly recommend it! Didn\u2019t mean it as an insult at all. You obviously harbor negative feelings\u2026 therapy would help. Have a good day!", "Instead of of saying it didn\u2019t effect her. You could have asked how it effected her. Maybe you would have learned something", "Yta. As the sibling of an addict, it has absolutely had an effect on my life. Stop playing victim and get on with your program. The apology part comes later.", "Drugs have a rippling effect. So yes. YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE.", "YTA because it\u2019s \u201caffected\u201d. Verb not noun.", "Bro I\u2019m a recovered addict 7 years this may. Let me assure you your addiction effects your family even if you don\u2019t think it does . People worry about them even if your not actively screwing them over. \n\nYou started recovery 2 months ago and good for you my dude . I\u2019m proud of you but we don\u2019t live in bubbles and the people who care about us are certainly effected we are just to self centered to see it.", "Sir, as a child and grandchild of 4 addicts, and ex-wife to a man with schizophrenia and addictions I can absolutely say that loved ones with drug/alcohol addiction affect every person who cares for them. I truly feel for you in your struggle, but never think you are the only one being hurt. I wish you success and healing in the future.\n\nYTA", "People who are addicted don't understand how it impacts everyone in your life.  Praying you get clean and work some steps, and you will understand.  My best friend of 40 years is my example.  I can't call you an AH. You have a disease.", "I really think you must still be on drugs to lack this much self-awareness. YTA", "Your sister probably got a whole different experience with her parents trust and issues and how she was treated because of you.", "YTA. Like so many addicts, your world view is so self centred that you can\u2019t understand that others were harmed by your addiction - specifically your actions. If someone lies, cheats, steals etc to support their addiction, those things hurt others. As the source of that hurt, you have no right to dictate how those who were affected deal with that.", "Yesterday I had to tell my raging alcoholic brother that he couldn\u2019t come to my wedding next year because of the whole raging alcoholism thing. His response (delivered while buzzed) was that his alcoholism hasn\u2019t effected me and I\u2019m imagining all of the shitty events that I remember. It was a heart breaking and infuriating conversation. You\u2019ve probably had a much greater impact on your sister than you will ever know.", "YTA.  When you get further into recovery, you\u2019ll start to develop some empathy for the people who watched you killing yourself with drugs and watched you take advantage of the people around you because you\u2019re so sick.  If you\u2019re going the 12 step route, that\u2019s a part of it.  You hurt your sister, whether you realize it or not.  People who are intoxicated can be scary and unpredictable, and I doubt you even noticed her reaction because you were too in your disease and either intoxicated or trying to figure out your next fix.  Good luck to you, and I hope you get well enough to be embarrassed by this post one day.", "YTA. \n\nAnd your addiction affected her. Not effected.", "YTA - get help. Your addiction hurts everyone around you. You literally stole a shitload of money from your parents how can you lie to yourself and everyone else saying \"it didn't affect\" your sister?", "YTA!", "YTA. As someone whose COUSINS have been dealing with drug addiction, I can tell you that it does affect you. Even if it's not directly affecting you like your parents were affected, and even if you're not close, it's painful to see someone you care about go through that. It's painful to see how much my aunt and uncle have had to go through. It's painful to always fear they'll overdose, or to learn about horrible things that happened to them as a result of addiction. Please realize that. Even though my cousins' addiction hasn't affected me in a tangible way, my heart hurts because of it.\n\nAnd anyway, you don't get to tell other people how something affected THEM.", "If you want to get clean and stay that way, your going to have to find humility and take responsibility for what you did to other people.\n\nYour sister was a kid when you stole money from your parents and you think THAT wouldnt effect her? You think that they're worry for your addiction didnt cause any neglect to come her way? You think that her brother killing himself wouldnt take a toll on her? \n\nYou might have rationalized your feelings of love and empathy away to try and suppress whatever it was you were doing but the healthy minded people learned to love with the pain that you were running away from.\n\nI'm glad your getting help, and I hope you find the strength to face your mistakes in order to stay clean.", "I have brothers who are addicts. I\u2019m more than 10 years younger than them so we aren\u2019t close. I didn\u2019t even grow up in same house as them and it does still affect me.

Typical narcissistic \u201cmain character energy\u201d that most addicts display.", "YTA - still not taking responsibility - claiming your parents got you kicked out of college - no you and your addiction caused you to get kicked out. You need at least another 6 months before you start to see just how bad you fucked over your family and friends. Everybody around you suffers from an addiction. You have a ways to go and I feel for your therapist because once you get sober and clear headed I think you are going to find out you are a flaming asshole even without the addiction. Good luck to you - you need help - hope you get it.", "Yes, YTA.

Good luck staying clean that way. Of course you are the asshole.", "YTA", "YTA and as a recovered alcoholic of many years (as much as any of us can be) I can tell you that you will not stay sober with this attitude. Take responsibility and don\u2019t run from the shame that it brings. Just because you\u2019ve never thought about why she might be hurt, doesn\u2019t mean that she wasn\u2019t. She had to watch her parents give up on a child, and wonder if they would ever do that to her. she was most assuredly neglected by them at a pivotal time in her development, so that they could focus on you. \n\nYou are being self centered.

Addiction affects the entire family. Siblings can feel unseen because their addict sibling is hogging every bit of attention whether they want it or not. Addiction causes fights and constant worry which can lead to an increase in cortisol in the brain which does cause many issues. So in a sense you did cause her indirect trauma. I\u2019m the daughter of an addict (my dad wound up dying from addiction at 49) He gave me direct and indirect trauma. Now you sister posting that was probably her way of letting you know that she cares. But I see how that would upset you. I wish you luck in your recovery. It\u2019s a hard road, but you can make it!", "And blaming his parents for \u201cgetting him kicked out\u201d of school.

Criminals apologize to both victims and families cause it matters. You\u2019re stupid", "Especially when OP has said that he massively fucked his parents over with money and he also fucked over his sister with money also!

Sorry, can\u2019t buy groceries this week as we\u2019re broke. Sorry the lights got cut off since we can\u2019t pay the bill.

She and I do work it into conversations sort of frequently, but not obsessively, and only when she brings it up. For example, she\u2019ll tell me about some of the crazy shenanigans her young co-workers pull (she\u2019s a server in a restaurant) involving after-work bar hopping, debauchery, and vomiting, LOL. (Her words.)\n\nShe\u2019ll roll her eyes and cringe if she sees someone on TV staggering along and making a complete fool of themselves, and she\u2019ll say, \u201cYikes!

This is self-sabotage at its finest.", "Joking and acting stoic is a defense mechanism and self-preservation. You see how much everyone is hurting, and you don't want to add to it, so you pretend it doesn't bother you. Meanwhile, you have nobody to turn to, because they're all dealing with his stuff. It sucks, and it fucks you up. OP is a major AH.", "Posting about it on social media makes her an asshole IMO. Very attention seeking behaviour and she didn't directly hear about him seeking help from him. This is also an extremely difficult situation for OP and being publically shamed by his sister who he doesn't even talk with anymore isn't exactly helpful for his recovery IMO. Not saying he's not in the wrong at all but that was a pretty dick move by her IMO.", "Definitely!!  Jolly Tooth nailed it.

Walk myself home from school (a 3 mile walk in one direction, and in extreme heat due to Phoenix weather).\n\nI was also forced to tag along with my mother whenever she visited my brother in whatever drug hole he'd crawled into. That's pretty fucking traumatic.\n\nI ended up, at the age if 15, having to help raise his kid while he and his addict girlfriend were passed out in the bedroom.\n\nHaving an addict in the family fucking sucks.", "It sounds like she posted on her own page not even tagging OP at all and not talking about his recovery process, just her feelings on the matter and what she had to deal with when he was using around her. :/", "He said he was sent the post so it sounds like a screenshot (esp as he had to ask someone to ask her to unblock him so they could talk. )", "I don\u2019t know what the \u201cprize\u201d is, but try having *two* drug addict brothers. 15 yrs going\u2026 my mother has never thought to ask me how I am doing.

It\u2019s an additional burden that I don\u2019t think she has the mental resources to bear.)

This early in recovery it isn't always a good idea to reach back out, and OP showed exactly why it can be a really bad idea.
