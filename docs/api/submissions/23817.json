I sympathize with families cause sometimes they get broken up even though they had booked their seats together and tried to plan in advance.

Their desire to sit together is not more important than yours.   If the dad wasn't with the child then maybe, but one parent is sufficient.", "You're NTA. They can be separated for a few hours. They're not joined at the hip. They can plan sooner, plan better, and get over it when they can't force others to cater to them when they fail to do so.", "NTA, they likely tried to use a \"hack\" to save money, they don't pay to have seats together hoping people will oblige and move for them. It backfired clearly, they'll probably think you are an AH, but who cares about entitled people.", "NTA, the child is with one of their parents, it doesn't need to be sat with both. They should have booked seats together if it was so important. Having said that I don't think you should have screamed at them - screaming at strangers in public looks unhinged, and I don't really understand why your girlfriend cried at some fairly mild conflict.", "Nta but it's not always just as simple as paying for your seat. I just got back from a trip to Japan from LA and the airline gave me no option to pick my seat. I would have paid extra to do it, but because we booked through our credit card, they said we didn't have the option. We asked around if someone would be willing to move, but definitely didn't EXPECT someone to do so. Frustrating and lesson learned by me to book direct with the airline.", "NTA cmon man stick up for your self and don\u2019t feel bad about it, in this case you did nothing wrong, handled it perfect as far as I can tell", "NTA she should have paid to sit together like y\u2019all did", "NTA. Every single person has the opportunity to pick the seat that they want when they book their seats.

I don't understand the level of  entitlement on this issue.", "Was she moving ahead from her seats? The better request would be to offer the person next to her seats further ahead and ask the husband and kid to move back.", "Nta. They're not entitled to your seat. They allow people to pre-book seats, they should of paid for that. Atleast the kids had a parent with them so they should be happy", "NTA. If the mother wanted to sit next to the child she could have traded seats with her husband.", "Definitely NTA. I suppose the kid didn\u2019t need her attention 24/7 and being only with their father is enough.

The last time I flew I saw on the kiosk where my seat was, did not like it so changed it. Yes there was a fee involved but I was ok with that. I was not going to wait until boarding time then complained about it. Get to the airport early enough to deal with things like this.", "\"But I'm a mother!\" Lmao", "Or a straight-up scam.", "Sometimes, your seat asdignment gets moved anyway for any number of reasons, so \"they should have booked seats together\" really isn't valid.  That being said, they absolutely should have addressed that with the airline instead of a random passenger.", "Casual sexism", "We're FAAAAMMMILLLLEEEEEEEEEE!", "I asked the airline/parent airline/credit card travel team when we booked in March, when we tried to check in 24 hours before the flight, physically at the checkin counter, and again at the desk at the gate. I either got the runaround or was just told to eff off and nothing could be done. My last ditch was to ask the solo passenger next to me politely to trade aisle for aisle and luckily they said yes. I woulda moved on if they said no though, as their seat is their seat..."]}
