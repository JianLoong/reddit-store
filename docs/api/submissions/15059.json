She's obviously still in high school so she only works a couple days a week. \n\nYesterday my husband and I talked to her about contributing to the household with part of her check. Both of us had to pay around her age as children, and we gave her a couple months to settle into the job before bringing it up, so we thought it would be okay. \n\nI called the charge \"rent\" in my title because I didn't know what else to say, but that's not really what it is. I'm not going to kick my daughter out of the house if she stops paying (obviously!!) I just genuinely need help. My family isn't in a good financial situation and getting some extra cash from her really helps me be able to afford my own rent, and food for my children. I have another child besides her, who isn't working yet. I do actually need the help. \n\nThe charge is only $40/check, or $80/month. Which basically equals out to her paying for her own music subscription, and the gas I use driving her to and from work, maybe slightly more. Each check for her is around $200-220. \n\nShe told me I was being unfair because she's a minor and needs to be able to save her money. But I'm still leaving her the majority of her check to save or do whatever she wants with, and all I'm really doing is making up for the extra gas money I have to spend now that I drive her to work. \n\nEDIT for clarification: I didn't call this \"rent\" to her face. I told my daughter I need help affording the gas I use when I drive her to and from work. And she knows part of what I'm taking out is going directly to her personal music subscription. I titled my post as rent but never framed it that way to her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681771869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12q0b8i/aita_for_charging_my_daughter_rent/", "score": 1948, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For example, I would suggest that you get her a debit/credit card that is tied to her checking account and have the music subscription come from that. As for gas, ask her to fill the gas tank once a month & take her with you to get the gas (the money per month she\u2019s putting on her card should be about the same as to what you\u2019re thinking of charging anyway). \n\nThis builds her credit, which helps her, and helps you by taking the charges off your own credit accounts. Also, then she can see what her money is going towards *and* she can make some decisions. (For example, if she decides that the music subscription is too much, she can cancel it and then that\u2019s not on you.) \n\nHaving a working student learn fiscal responsibility by managing her own finances while she\u2019s still living with you helps to prepare her for the next stage of her life. It also prepare her for more adult responsibilities without it all hitting her at once. \n\nMight be a good compromise", "Mommie Dearest. \n\nWhy can\u2019t you just tell her to pay for her own music subscription rather than come off as an ahole charging her rent? I know you claimed to have said you need the money for gas. But that\u2019s not how it sounds.\n\nSimple\u2014You want a music subscription, you pay for it.", "Why are you making this so ridiculous and convoluted.\n\nJust tell her that now that she has a job she needs to pay her own music subscription and gas.", "YTA. She's a minor. If you want her to pay for her music subscription then tell her \"hey your responsible for paying for your own entertainment now\". \n\nBut, necessities like gas are on you as the parent unless she has her own car. (Kind of BS to hold her responsible for gas to get her to a job that you basically say you need her to have in order to make rent and grocery bills)\n\nETA: or driving herself to anywhere that's not school or work.", "YTA. It is not your child\u2019s responsibility to feed your other children or make paying the rent easier for you. She\u2019s not a piggy bank, she\u2019s trying to make her own way.", "If you struggle that much you shouldn't have signed up for apple subscription in the first place. You should be upfront with her, that she can walk or bike to work or if you have to bring her it costs her x amount. So yes yta. However context can make all the difference", "YTA \n\nYou have full financial responsibility of her until she\u2019s an adult, that\u2019s what you signed up for when you became a parent.", "YTA. I hate when parents take money from their children. You or your spouse can sign up for OT. If you take it she will hate you. \n\nAn apple subscription is 10.99/month. If you take $80/month that\u2019s still $69 which seems steep just for gas when you\u2019re supposed to tote her around. Might go better if you let her keep her money and save for a car then pay her own gas.", "YTA, and honestly, if I was her I\u2019d quit my job to spite you.", "YTA - She's a minor and you shouldn't be expecting her to contribute to household expenses.  It's not her fault you have money issues.", "YTA. You have financial problems but you still pay for not essencial services like a music subscription? It's something good that she helps you pay the bills and you have to tell her the truth about it, but, please, check your priorities.", "YTA for calling it \"rent\". If you told your daughter the truth and said you need help with bills that would be different.  She is right he is a minor and shouldn't be expected to contribute to the household.", "YTA. I worked in high school and was allowed to keep my money with the understanding that any snacks, meals out with friend, 'fun' clothes (ie. not required for school), music/entertainment, etc.  and transport to/from work on the bus was on my dime. When I graduated, I paid for my own phone line and saved up to move out. Please, don't rely on your child who is still in school to make ends meet. Give her a fixed charge for the music subscription and a monthly charge for gas (that has to be reasonable), but don't call it rent. And if you are having a hard time getting food, apply for SNAP benefits or visit a food pantry. It's not fun, I've had to do it, but it is what it is-- food.", "YTA, your 16 year old shouldn\u2019t be paying you anything. It\u2019s YOUR JOB as the parent to provide for her.", "If you were forcing her to give you a % for you to put into savings for her I would be all for this.  Your daughter isn't responsible for the bills of the house.  That is your responsibility.  I had five kids (they are all grown up and out of the house now) and when money was tight my wife and I worked extra jobs.  We didn't collect from our children's paychecks.  If you want to teach her financial responsibility.  \n\n*\"I do actually need the help.\"* sounds an awful lot like I don't want to get a second job.  If you want her to pay for some things that she does, fine.  Phone?  Her own entertainment expenses when she goes out with friends?  All okay.  Pitching in for the house bills?  In my world that makes you both as big of AHs as your own parents apparently were.  YTA", "INFO actually- how much is this music subscription? Seems like maybe you\u2019re backtracking a bit because gas to get to a part time job plus an Apple Music subscription does not add up to $80/month.\n\nIf you\u2019re really struggling I find it hard to believe that up until now you\u2019ve been paying upwards of $50-$60 a month so she can stream music.", "YTA. You chose to have this child. That means you're supposed to take care of her until adulthood etc. I get that financial hardships exist, but that's for you and your spouse to figure out. She should not have to help you out. And you're only now looking to charge her because she had the drive/need to get a part time job to earn money. I assume she plans on saving that money or spending it on things she wants ... so that YOU don't have to pay for such things. Good for her!", "YTA. Instead of framing it like you did, you should have a frank conversation with her about the rising cost of running your household. Then you can let her know that she needs to start paying her way for some things, like her Apple Music. Charging her an arbitrary amount isn\u2019t cool, but letting her see where her money is going by paying for her own non-essentials is probably fine.", "YTA. She\u2019s a minor, a child. It\u2019s your job to provide for her, that is a choice you made when you opted to reproduce.\n\nI think asking her to contribute to the workload of the household (chores, doing her own laundry, etc.) is reasonable and encouraged. But keeping your collective financial lives afloat is YOUR job.", "Yes YTA\n\nYour children didn't ask to be born. If you want your daughter to start paying for more of her own things, that's fine, but no you do not charge your underage child rent.", "YTA.\n\nShe's a minor, not an adult. Why are you making her pay rent when she should be able to rely on you for shelter?", "Info: if she gets rides to work elsewhere and pays for her own music, will you stop charging her \"rent?\"\n\nBTW, lots of my teacher friends earn extra money tutoring", "This would have been a lot easier if you just said, \u201chey, you\u2019re responsible for your own XYZ subscription now.\u201d", "YTA. If it's not rent, don't call it rent. If you want your daughter to help contribute toward family expenses, just say that directly and let her decide what she wants to do. If she does, it should be because she **wants** to, not because she feels pressured into it.", "NAH.  I know the optics are not good on this but I don't think she is TA.  I grew up in a family without much money and as soon as we were old enough to get jobs we did and I would contribute some amount to the family so I understand.  It sucks but you do what you have to do.  Also I think it taught me the value of money early on and a strong work ethic.  Don't be too hard on OP", "YTA.  She's a minor and you're still responsible for her.\n\nYou could tell her she's responsible for all her phone bill, extras like makeup, movies, extra clothes etc.  But there's no way she should be contributing to household expenses.  If you need the money for that, you need to reconsider what you're doing.", "YTA. You and/or your husband could get another job, maybe a part-time one. But you're preventing your daughter from saving for the future. She could save for college, a car, a place of her own. It's not her job to pay your bills when she's not even done with high school yet. But I bet even if she got her own car and thus saved you the gas money you and your husband would still insist on taking her money.", "YTA. She is a minor. She doesn\u2019t need to pay rent or any money to you. You are her mother and you are supposed to take care of her. Not the other way around.", "Okay paying her for her own music and gas is fine. I did the same at that age when I was working. But you said you needed \u201csome extra cash.\u201d Don\u2019t rely on your kids. Apply for assistance. YTA", "Sorry, but YTA. I am totally on board with your daughter paying her music subscription. The 'rent' or gas, or whatever, is where things went too far.\n\nI also have a 16 yr old, and she recently started a job. We made it clear to her that we will still pay for the level of things we have before, but \"extras\" are on her. She has been asking for a music subscription, but I said no. Now she has a music subscription. I still bought her prom dress, but when she decided she needed new jewelry, that was on her.\n\nI understand that financial situations vary and often suck, but it isn't your daughter's job to fix your financial problems.", "Going against the grain here NTA. Yes having kids means it\u2019s your responsibility, but music subscriptions, and having a job you have to chauffeur her to is not a necessity of raising a child those are a privileges. Just because you have children does not mean you have to give them everything thing they want. Cancel the subscription and if it\u2019s possible tell her to buy a bus pass. With her new found responsibility of having a job she needs to figure out her own transportation. Or pay for the gas it takes to drive her to and from work. If she was bumming a ride from anyone else she would be expected to pay them for gas.", "YTA. She\u2019s your minor child that you are legally obligated to take care of & make sure her basic needs are met. If you & your husband need help financially maybe one of you should try to pick up some OT or a PT job but taking money from your 16yo when she could be saving is wrong. If she was 18 that\u2019s a different story. If you\u2019re that hard up for money maybe you should talk to your daughter & see if she\u2019s willing to help out but to frame it as \u201crent\u201d isn\u2019t going to fly.", "I'm not sure if i can say YTA. I would just stop paying for her subscriptions. I wouldn't want my kid to feel pressured to help out.", "Oh boy!\n\nI do understand being strapped, but that's not your daughter's doing.  If she were 18, working and not in college; I'd ask for rent.\n\nDid she know she would have to give you money, before she got her job?\n\nNTA, but this all could've been handled better.\n\nI hope you can find more help for your financial situation, but at 16 she is not obligated to give you any money. I think discussing gas money would have been a better approach from the start.\n\nI hope you can compromise.  This is a good opportunity for you both to put things in perspective and move forward as a family.", "[deleted]", "At first, I was like... soft YTA. Then, I read the amount ($40 per check) and switched to DEFINITELY NTA.\n\nShould family help family? Yes. Is she old enough to pay for her own music subscription? Yes. Is she old enough to have a car and pay for its own insurance and gas? Yes.\n\n$80 ain't shit. The way you worded it sounded like you were asking for significantly more money. I get that you brought up food, but gas is hella expensive in 2023.\n\nTeaching a teenager that things cost money and what they cost is important for financial literacy. Even if you weren't cash strapped, it's not unreasonable ask her to be responsible for her own expenses outside of room and board and food. Not everyone has a loaded parent that can gift them a car when they turn 16 or pay for their insurance or buy them name brand clothes. Asking her to cover her own gas to get to and from work is REASONABLE.\n\nTeaching financial literacy is not something most parents do well. I would take this opportunity to have a coming of age conversation about finances. What will she do to cover rent when she moves out? College fees? Cell Phone fees? What does water/sewage/garbage cost. How much do you need to budget for food for 1 person, let alone 2 or more? Saving for a car. Car repairs. How much those repairs and maintenance actually costs. Etc.\n\nYou're a good mom for worrying and even better for checking in with a 3rd party opinion.\n\nEdit: Remove \"rent\" from the vocabulary. This isn't rent. This is her covering her own expenses above and beyond what society deems as the parent's responsibility.", "YTA but only for wording it as rent. If you were just honest with your daughter and said that money is tight and gas is really expensive so she needs to cover what is to and from her job, also now that she is making her money she can cover her music subscription, that would have been different. Anything else you take off the top of that isn\u2019t fair.", "Yta, she is your minor daughter. It\u2019s not her fault you didn\u2019t financially plan to have a family.", "I mean it makes it hard when you state that you are using the money for household items.  If you are in dires need you have to do what you have to do, however a daughter old enough to work should already see how close you are running to the bottom line.  If 80 bucks a month is going to make a difference you are very close to the line (I can barely run into the grocery store for a few items and spend less than that)\n\nI strongly believe in having teenagers pay some sort of rent.  It teaches them money rules and responsibility before it can damage them.\n\nMy friends charged both their daughters rent and gave them the money when they started post secondary.  \n\nDefinitely have them pay gas money but this isn't a monthly fee it should be per use charge.  Teaches them it costs money to work.  They also become more apt on finding their own way to work that maybe cheaper (aka walking or biking to work)", "If she finds a different way to get to work without you driving her I bet you would still charge her that money. Get out of that girl's pocket.", "Don\u2019t take her money. Help her open a checking account, and make her responsible for some of her own recreational bills. She should pay them with her own card. Focus on money management. I also grew up poor and worked as a teen to help support the family. My mother did this with me to help end the cycle of poverty.", "Ooh boy, I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA for requiring her to pay for certain things (ie her own music subscription.) That\u2019s a nonessential thing that she could pay for. But don\u2019t require her to pay *you* anything. Set it up so it\u2019s her own account and she has to manage it. I had to pay for my own school supplies and school clothes from 13 forward (not advocating for that), but I always made my own purchase and did not pay my mom \u201crent.\u201d She shouldn\u2019t be giving you her money.", "Nah- just have her pay for her own subscriptions and ask her to fill the gas tank every now and then.", "YTA. Don't have kids if you can't afford them. My father stole money from me all the time, pawned gifts that I had been given from other family members, took credit cards out in my name when I was a minor, etc. Guess who I don't talk to? My dad.", "NTA, since you're basically asking her to cover the cost of a few things she benefits from. Maybe rent is a bad term for it. \n\nWhen I was a teenager I paid for my own gas, CDs, going out with friends, games, phone line, some clothes.\n\nMy parents paid my car insurance, food, most clothes, all the necessities.", "YTA. Let her keep her money and pay for her own music subscription.", "YTA\n\nShe is a child, she didn't ask to be born, you chose to have her now you take care of her. If she wants extra things that are not necessary, like music subscriptions, then she can pay for them herself. Everything else is your responsibility until she is an adult.", "YTA. It's not up to her to make sure ends meet. That's your job as a parent. The goal should be learning to manage her money. My parents had me pay for my own car insurance, which they explained their bill would go up if they add a vehicle and if I want to drive I had to make up the difference.", "NTA, I was sure you were the AH, until I read on.  For those of you screeching that she is the AH, need to read the whole thing.  Forty bucks out of 200-220 and it is going to her own music subscription and gas not food or rent.\n\n You worded it like she is taking up your slack in paying rent and feeding your other kids.  You might want to reword that and explain that you are asking her to take over responsibility for one luxury item and her gas.\n\nI have my son pay for some of his stuff and I have him pay half of somethings that he wants but does not need.  He also pays for one subscription because I loathe it but he loves it, so I refuse to pay for it but let him with his own money.", "Eh, nah. It\u2019s the \u201crent\u201d part that\u2019s throwing people off. Tell her now that she has a job she has to start supporting some of her own hobbies/extra. Paying for gas transportation to/from work is reasonable. And her music subscription.\n\nETA: OP give her options. Tell her that her Apple Music is X a month. If she doesn\u2019t want to pay it, stop the subscription. Gas is X per month. If she wants cheaper options then she can either carpool, public transport or figure it out herself.", "NTA in principle,  I think it's a good idea for her to get used to paying for things,  but I think you're charging her too much.  I would make it maybe $20-30 per check.  Apart from anything else,  it would be a compromise,  and that's usually how stalemates like this get resolved.", "NTA but not best way of handling this. \n\nGently explain your situation to her and ask her to start helping contribute towards a few of her own non essentials that she enjoys like her music subscription.", "Perhaps your wording was insensitive but you seem to be asking her to pay for things that are beyond \u201cnecessities\u201d ie music subscription/ gas money\u2026those are reasonable.   \u201cRent\u201d is not at her age. When my sons started working and driving they paid for most non essential things like \u201c Spotify, new phone if they wanted one more than every 3 years, name brand clothes etc.\u201d.  So I guess this is a long way to say if you are only asking for non- essential luxuries the. NTA", "We have our kids split their money.  \u2153 to long-term savings (something big), \u2153 to medium savings (new phone,  iPad, etc...), \u2153 to spend more as they see fit.   Rides suck, but it's kinda a part of the parenting deal.   We try to keep their jobs reasonably close to home so gas is not a huge issue.   \n\nApple music would be something they would be paying out of spending money.   But all the money should be theirs and their choice how to use it. But b is OK to have them be responsible for some of their own extras when they are working.", "Not passing judgment, but maybe have her pay for the extra stuff that she wants to have, like the music subscription. Maybe rephrasing it would be the best\u2026\n\nAlso a curious question- look at how many miles it is to make a round trip to her work. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 2 miles, or 20 (which can drain a gas tank quickly).", "The way you worded this post with the focus on yourself and how you need help from your minor child to pay the bills is not a good look. \n\nBut then, when you went on to explain the types of expenses you wanted her to cover and none of those are needs. Even a cell phone isn\u2019t a true need, much less a personal music subscription. Those are things she can cover with her job at 16 and beyond.\n\nI guess that means NAH, despite your cringe title. \n\nTruthfully for parenting help, I\u2019d go to the parenting sub. I think this conversation needs to be framed as a choice for her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re growing up, and you\u2019ve reached an age where you can work and now provide some of your own wants. The money from your job gives you more freedom because you can now buy things I couldn\u2019t get you but it also comes with responsibility. \n\nI need you to plan to budget X for your music subscription, Y for fun clothes, and Z for gas since we are driving extra. If you\u2019d like to buy a bus pass instead, you can. That\u2019s only A per month instead. If you\u2019d rather not have those things - that fine. You can save the money. But I won\u2019t be paying for X and Z starting next month.\n\nOnce you turn 17, you\u2019ll also need to plan in budget for your cell phone bill. If you buy a car, just remember gas and insurance for that car will be your responsibility.\n\nI know this is some of this is the least fun parts of becoming a grown-up. But I want you to be able to learn these money management skills before you\u2019re fully responsible for all of your own expenses like rent and food. It will help you prioritize what matters most to you.\u201d", "Tell her to pay her music subscription then???", "This is an odd one for me. The idea of telling my kid I\u2019m short of money so they need to help with family expenses isn\u2019t okay with me. \n\nHowever, telling my kid that we\u2019re short on money so I won\u2019t be able to pay for luxuries (rides to work, music subscription services), is completely fine. So I can understand your daughter\u2019s reaction, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re short on funds to say \u201cSorry, no subscription service, take the bus/bike ride/walk.\u201d", "NAH. You\u2019re getting a lot of flack for this but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable. If your daughter knows you\u2019re struggling financially, it shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal for her to pay for her own music subscription and entertainment. But are you really using $60+ in gas monthly to drive her from work? Seems to me that $20 a paycheque would be a more fair amount to cover gas for a few short rides a week and one streaming service.", "NTA but this is a difficult situation. Millions of teenagers help their families once they are old enough to contribute.

I would say NTA if you told your daughter to pay for her music subscription herself and maybe asked her for $10 or so a paycheck \u201cto the house\u201d. I would then put that aside for her for when she moves out. I think that\u2019s an older school way of parenting where you\u2019re teaching your child a bit of budgeting and making them aware of charges that will be reoccurring once they leave their parents home.", "NAH - I think people are getting hung up on phrasing here. there is nothing wrong with asking her to contribute some money towards her own personal luxuries. I can see how she would be upset about it though.", "NTA with caveats. \n\nSometimes families really do need help from their teens who work, but I don't know if that's the case here. I would just have her pay for her subscription and every third tank of gas or something. She's old enough to contribute in this way for the non-necessaries and she will learn about how much things cost (i.e. gas). This way she can see where her money is going and what its value is.", "NTA but you did this to yourself.\n\nDaughter is 16 and doesn't have her own license yet wants to work and therefore needs to rely on mom to get back and forth.  If she had her own vehicle and license mom wouldn't be responsible to fill daughters vehicle with fuel so she can go to work. She should 100% pay for her own music subscription and fuel for the vehicle.  She could walk or take the bus or take an Uber and learn the value of money and realize transportation costs required to get to and from work.  Mom isn't responsible for this.  But half the redittors on here who were babied by their parents and driven around until they were 21 will be up in arms over this I'd bet.", "NTA, but do it differently. Instead of asking her for money, have her start paying some of her expenses directly, such as the music subscription. Hopefully she has a debit card and can do that.  Cancel it and let her figure it out if she really wants it. Also, if she has a phone, she could pay her share of that. Tell her how much you pay for her phone line and tell her she can get her own plan if she thinks she can find something cheaper, if she can't, then she can pay you to keep her on your plan. How far away is her work? If it's really a lot of gas, then she needs to find a closer job.

You\u2019re not in the wrong for deciding that she has to contribute some of her money for her own luxuries, but you went about it in the wrong way. You structured it and worded it wrong. You acknowledge that it isn\u2019t rent, and you shouldn\u2019t have called it that. First, it\u2019s illegal in a lot of places to charge dependent minors rent.

Second, and more importantly, even without any real threat of eviction, it\u2019s a high pressure word for a 16yo, one which implies a separation from the family. It\u2019s obvious to you that nothing fundamentally changes, but when you\u2019re 16 and just growing into the adult world, things just aren\u2019t that obvious.\n\nAgain, your desire that she use some of her money to relieve some of the household burden is not wrong in and of itself. She\u2019s 16 and has a job, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable that she pay for her own music subscription; it\u2019s perfectly reasonable that she absorb the cost of her own commute.

Tell her you\u2019re glad she wants to save money, but that she needs to learn how to do that in the real world, which includes budgeting. If she wants to keep her premium Spotify, she will have to pay for it moving forward; just as any other gainfully employed person would.

Their father works full time and thus we've chosen to buy a parking pass. It benefits the spawn, and they aren't expected to help with it, but they each choose to provide a small amount toward it. The two oldest have graduated, so they pay a percentage of our rent, utilities, health insurance, food, and gas, which works out to around $3-400 a month apiece. Both complained until we sat down and showed them how much it would cost them without our safety net. The two that haven't graduated are only asked to help with gas, assorted school fees, and one bag of groceries a month, and that's if they're working, which neither currently are.

We have a now-18 yr old and we checked with several sources as we'd heard this same exact thing. They don't start actually accumulating credit ratings until they hit 18", "Unfortunately, OPs daughter isn\u2019t old enough for a credit card. You have to be at least 18 (in most states) to get a credit solely in your name, but even then, you\u2019d more than likely have to get a secured credit card to build the credit for an unsecured one. OP could open a joint card in their name as well as the daughter\u2019s, but with their financial situation I would tell the kid not to. But, I do agree with getting a debit card for the kid.\n\nOP needs to take a look at what\u2019s necessary and unnecessary and start cutting expenses. Tell the kid they can take over the music subscription. If they don\u2019t, the mom cuts it off. Once I got a job, any additional things I wanted I had to pay for if they weren\u2019t deemed essential/necessary. \n\n\nI can understand where OP is coming from, but the way they approached the situation was completely wrong. Rather than demand a cut of the pay check, they could have presented their financial situation and asked the daughter. If the kid said no, that\u2019s that. No one is obligated to give away their earned money, and parents/guardians are legally obligated to provide living expenses\u2014 shelter, food, clothes, and basic care\u2014until 18, unless they\u2019re in one of the few areas that is 19 or 21. My question is: what would OP have done if the daughter didn\u2019t have a job?

I truly can\u2019t stand the argument that some parents make: \u201cmy parents did it, so I\u2019m doing it too.\u201d It truly irks me.

Encouraging your child to get a job, then asking for some of that income to help around the house, and then asking for some of that income to go toward the transportation that she needs to get to/from that job. \nI started working at 15 and we were far from wealthy. I paid for my own phone bill, my own music subscription, other wants. Not my needs. That's where I think the line should be drawn. \nThis might be a hot take but asking for your child to pay rent, particularly when they're under 18, is taking that money away from their future. Because my parents didn't make me pay bills when I first started working, I was able to buy my own car, and eventually get my own apartment. It motivated me because I was working toward a goal, of my own independence and success, rather than paying into something that wasn't tangible to me.", "I absolutely agree. I taught high school and the students who had to pay their parents for anything that wasn\u2019t just entertainment would end up so stressed out.

But that amount ISN'T typically a lot for most adults unless they're just *that* strapped for money.\n\nMy point is, if an Apple Music subscription and a little bit of gas in transportation to this kid's part time job (so not even every day, probably just a couple round trips a week) is enough to break this family, they probably have waaaay bigger issues going on than that Apple Music + gas money can save them from. Sure, I guess $80 can be enough to stock up on a few more groceries, but geez, that shouldn't be coming out of their kid's already tiny paychecks, how have they even been surviving up until this point at that rate? And how is it teaching their child financial responsibility to fork a chunk of their hard earned money to their parents? If anything it just teaches her that her parents AREN'T financially responsible that they're suddenly depending on their kid. It teaches her consequences for OTHER people's problems. \n\nSure, she might be learning that the world sucks and most of your money goes to bills, but why do those bills have to suddenly be on her shoulders just because she got a part time job? There are other and better ways to teach financial responsibility than just shoving your open hand in your kid's face and demanding them for money to provide services that you were already doing for years and on the line for as legal guardians. Of course, the music subscription isn't one of those needs, I agree that OP's kid could pay for that (I paid for my own Netflix subscription n junk when I worked in high school) but again, if a $10 subscription is enough to break this family's finances, than that $10 provided by her daughter instead probably isn't going to make much of a difference.\n\nBut idk, that's just my two cents. I worked summer jobs in high school and slung art commissions during the school year to pay for my own personal stuff but I do remember my parents hounded me for money to pay for their own shortcomings, and let me tell you, those memories aren't good ones, especially because that money just ended up going down the drain into their own bullshit. I also didn't live in a town where I could take an Uber or a bus, I lived in the sticks 25 minutes outside of town - meaning I had to rely on my parents for transportation which they were fine with providing me with because it meant I was working and gaining that experience - but I also didn't make near enough to just \"buy my own car\". I think people in this thread are forgetting how expensive cars are nowadays compared to when they were teens.\n\nThat said, as bad as my parents were with money at the time, they still knew it was their responsibility to get me places and that getting me to work benefitted me in the long run. It's not just about the money, it's about the valuable experience your kid is gaining working a job - so why should they have to give up the proof of that work to their parents whose job it is to provide?", "It would be different if the parent wasn\u2019t pocketing the cash.  I had a few friends who when they got jobs their parents charged them \u201cboard\u201d (idk if this is an Australian thing, it\u2019s like rent), maybe like $50 a month, but it went into a savings account for them that they got given no-strings-attached when they moved out.", "and \"full financial responsibility\" includes a premium music plan and cell phone with unlimited data? haha", "Paying for her music subscription is not part of that responsibility.", "Also if the family is this bad off, sounds like kiddo needs to save some money for when she moves out or goes to college.

Cool, here's a bank account so you can pay for it yourself because it isn't in the family budget (and make sure family budget is NOT paying for it for anyone else, otherwise you're just lying/ being an AH who makes your teenager act like an adult when she's not yet). \n\nTaking an arbitrary amount of money doesn't teach anything.

It's to her credit that she chooses to work and save up her money, but transporting a minor to and from work is not a parental responsibility the way providing a home, food, clothing and medical care are parental responsibilities.

And I know plenty of parents who do not provide either music subscriptions or cellphones OR drive their kids to work - with or without payment for gas. The kids figure it out, or they don't.
