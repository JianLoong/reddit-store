Theres a big age difference between my brothers, and I. We\u2019ve never been close but I get along with 3 out of my 5 brothers.\n\nI don\u2019t know the 2 don\u2019t like me, they just don\u2019t. One of them who i\u2019ll call Levi would verbally abuse every chance he got (I was 15, and he was 25), I needed, and still am in therapy. He stopped but blamed it all on his struggles. He hasn\u2019t apologized, and clearly still hates me.\nThe other who i\u2019ll call Zane made it clear he wants nothing to do with me, he hasn\u2019t said anything but he acts different every time i\u2019m around him.\n\nNeither of them have gone to birthdays, sports events, or even my graduation. The graduation part was a big deal in my family, but my parents said they don\u2019t have to be in my life if they don\u2019t want to. Everyone eventually forgot about it.\n\nSo heres the problem:\nZane is getting married soon. Everyone in the family is invited but me. I want to go to his wedding. I don\u2019t hate Zane, and I\u2019d like to get closer to him one day\n\nSo I asked him why I wasn\u2019t invited, which he ignored. I\u2019ll admit I kept bothering him on why I wasn\u2019t invited, and why he hated me so much. I guess I made him snap because he sent me a bunch of hateful messages.\n\nI was upset, and talked to a friend, and she told me I should talk to my brothers. So I did, and showed them the texts. Levi sided with Zane, however the other 3 aren\u2019t happy and theyre thinking of not attending the wedding.\n\nZane is upset at this, and he called me saying I was trying to ruin his wedding, turn his brothers against him, and that I can\u2019t accept rejection. My parents aren\u2019t happy with Zane, but don\u2019t think my brothers should withdraw from the wedding.
