I\u2019m currently 39.5 weeks pregnant and we have a 2 year old. \n\nToday my husband suggested that we all do a hike to a sea cave. We arrived at the start of the hike at around 12pm and only returned to the car at about 4pm. It was a lovely walk, but I found it very challenging and it was an exceptionally hot day. \n\nAfterwards, we picked up some groceries and returned to their holiday house. Just to note, while our toddler had lunch during the walk (MIL did this - following and distracting our toddler and feeding by hand), but the adults did not. I packed snacks for everyone but MIL said we should eat when we got home (she doesn\u2019t believe in buying food out and is quite particular with what she eats). \n\nWe got back to the holiday house around 6 or 6:30pm, and everybody started cooking. I was beyond exhausted but gave my toddler dinner, until MIL said she would take over (throughout she kept making comments about how best to feed them). I had a shower, drank water (I got really sunburnt) and then gave my toddler a bath. \n\nAt this point, I was feeling faint and just really needed to lay down. After getting my toddler dressed, I asked my husband to take over and do the bedtime routine. I told him that I really needed a nap. \n\nI was then woken up by my husband and told that I was really selfish. That everyone was waiting for me so they could have dinner. I went into the kitchen and he continued that everyone had been slaving away cooking, that I hadn\u2019t helped and I didn\u2019t communicate with anyone (or share that I wasn\u2019t going to eat). \n\nMIL then started saying how she was sick of how I act. That she never had any help raising her kids and never had any problems (she constantly implies that I\u2019m lazy). That she has chronic pain and everybody is exhausted. She then started talking in their language (which I don\u2019t understand) and at some point said she wanted to end the holiday. \n\nI apologised and said I was just really tired and the walk today was too much. My husband said I\u2019m a taker. Honestly, I wonder if I am. While I\u2019ve been trying to help with cooking and chores while we are away, I get quite anxious. MIL and FIL only eat food from their cuisine and are very critical of meals I make. I have also had a really rough pregnancy. \n\nSo AITA for taking a nap and not pushing through/helping out more?", "created_utc": 1673697917, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bmxiy/aita_for_sleeping_and_not_helping_my_inlaws_make/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You hiked. Got a sunburn. Took care of your toddler. Felt dizzy. But YOU are selfish??? \n\nNTA. \n\nI sure hope you have a support network outside of your horrible in laws and husband. Have the baby. Physically heal. Then leave.", "NTA.\n\nIf I were you, I'd think about if I want to stay married or not. Your husband sounds like a huge asshole.", "NTA, you have a serious husband problem tho. you are basically close to giving birth and they had you walk for hours in the heat without any food?? thats dangerous for a basic human, and you're heavily pregnant on top of that. and purposely talking in another language just so you cant understand is really AH.\n\nand because your MIL raised her kids without any help \"back in the days when women were considered like house elves\" is a BS excuse, and if her chronic pain is a good enough excuse that she shouldnt have had to do any cooking or whatever, so is your pregnancy.\n\nYou should have a serious talk with your husband if this is how the rest of your marriage is going to be, and reconsider if this is the life you want, because hes obviously not having your back.", "NTA.\n\nI just can't with this one. Either it's made up or you're being horribly abused by these people.  Quite why you're at a holiday home when you could give birth at any minute is beyond me.  I can't believe you typed all this out then asked if you are T A.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re 39.5 weeks pregnant, did a walk that\u2019s already exhausting for people who aren\u2019t pregnant and you NEEDED the rest.\n\nYour husband is a huge AH. If anything, he\u2018s the \"taker\". He can do the helping and he should prioritize your needs, well-being and rest. You\u2018re literally carrying his baby!", "I say NTA why at 40 weeks are they even suggesting you hike? They going to deliver on the path if you go into labor? You\u2019re not her, so her experience is irrelevant. Your hubs was rude to you & you nor baby need that stress, not healthy. Your body is busy, you\u2019re creating life. They\u2019re being inconsiderate imo. Congrats!!", "NTA\n\nBut, man, your husband and in-laws suck! Even if you weren't pregnant, if you don't feel well, you don't feel well. Does he act like a big baby when you're sick??\n\nThey dragged you out for a four-hour walk in the hot sun at 9 months pregnant, without even having any food, and it sounds like you might have gotten ill from this outing (like heat exhaustion). I'm all for pregnant women being active, but they failed to be concerned about your health in the first place.", "Definitely NTA. You\u2019re almost 40 weeks pregnant you should be ALLOWED to rest if you feel exhausted if anything your husband and his mom are huge AHs for berating you.", "NTA You are 40 weeks pregnant. ***WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?!*** Even if you weren't pregnant, you weren't the asshole and you told your husband you were going down for a nap. He should have communicated to them that you would not be joining them.\n\nBut can we talk about the real issue here. What is all this BS about how your MIL didn't need help with her kids. Is she saying that your HUSBAND shouldn't ever help with HIS children?! And he's agreeing with her?!\n\nOh dear, I'm really sorry you already have children with this man. ...But if this is how your husband is, you may want to consider moving in with family or a friend before you give birth. Because you need a strong support system in place, and you don't have that with these people.", "NTA \n\nOmg OP a 4 hour hike with a toddler when your heavily pregnant??? Of course you needed a nap!!! Your husband needs to reevaluate his actions here. He was incredibly selfish to make you walk that long and not consider how tired and hungry you would be! \n\nIf your MIL says she didn\u2019t need help when she had kids then stop taking her help. You are not a taker OP, they are just highly critical people and need to think more about you and less about themselves. \n\nIn future I would avoid holidays like these as it\u2019s clearly not good for your physical and mental health.", "NTA, and I have to ask - if you\u2019re due to give birth in 2-3 days, why are you on a family holiday in the first place? Were you pressured to go by your husband and in-laws?\n\nPushing yourself to the limit, getting dehydration and sunburn, not being given time to nap - these are all things which could have some serious consequences for you and baby at this stage of your pregnancy. Does your husband understand this? \n\nYour MIL sounds like an all round, controlling AH, but I\u2019d say the bigger issue here is that your husband shows little to no concern for the health and well-being of his wife and unborn baby. \n\nI would strongly suggest talking to your midwife at the soonest opportunity about your home situation, as based on your story I wouldn\u2019t expect things to get any easier after delivering your baby. You need help, support and understanding, especially during the weeks and months after delivery. Your midwife may well be able to help with assessments and referrals for further help and support for you; with a toddler, a new born and a husband who refuses to give you any sort of help, you could genuinely be at higher risk of post-natal physical and psychological conditions.", "NTA. I\u2019m not pregnant and would need a nap after that walk too. Your husband should want to treat you like a queen during this time, and not bash you with his mom. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA. You're 39 weeks pregnant and had to hike for hours. You took care of your kid, and told your husband about the nap.\nWhat HE should have done is explain to his parents how exhausted you were and save you some dinner for later.", "NTA. Sorry you picked such a crappy family to marry into. I understand right now is probably not the best time to leave and start over but think long and hard whether you want to stay with a husband like that.", "NTA you sound like an incredibly strong woman. You hiked while so heavily pregnant? Damn girl. Your husband however is a horrible man.", "And you're having another kid with this man ...", "NTA\n\na 4 hour hike when you are 2 weeks from giving birth...you are a damn super hero!\n\n They are supposed to be family and should be there to support you, not attack you. \n\nHaving a nap is not being lazy, it is self care and is essential.", "NTA- Toxic in-laws are fine to deal with as long as your husband is on your side but this angered me. Your husband is the biggest AH in this story, he\u2019s supposed to be your biggest support system.", "NTA. Throw your whole husband away though cause he is one of the biggest AH\u2019s I\u2019ve seen on here. \nJust from a different perspective- my husband took over everything and wouldn\u2019t let me do anything at 35 weeks pregnant and on\u2026. So your husband calling you selfish and a taker for having a much needed nap at 39.5 weeks is beyond fucked up.", "maybe stay away from husband and his family until after you have given birth atleast .... sounds like you already have 2 toddlers and another on the way", "NTA. I don't know what culture they are from, but that family consists of assholes, especially your husband.\nI'm willing to bet he is one of those wonderful men that think every household responsibility should fall on the woman, and he should be above it all. Stand up for yourself, don't let him or his family bully you. You are fully pregnant, and they need to step up. Especially your husband. I hope you know what you signed up for, because it sounds like a life of drudgery.", "NTA - Tell Husband,  MIL to go take a hike! At 40 weeks pregnant, if that isn't abuse I don't know what is!", "So you're literally about to give birth any minute, and they expect you to do all of these things that would exhaust just about anyone, and still help cook?? Hell no lol Doesnt seem like they needed help in the first place. NTA & good luck because they will not change. I suggest r/justnomil", "NTA. \n\nNO ONE gets to decide what someone else's physical needs and limitations are.", "NTA - Wtf is wrong with this people ? \nYou are 39.5 pregnant, go to a long walk , dont eat and really neaded to rest and they say you should help more ? \nEven if you were not expecting a baby , your body was asking for a rest \nYour husband is a major asshole too , you warn him and he does not care at all", "NTA, at all. You\u2019re rocking it really. At almost 40 weeks you need to prioritize your health and your husband absolutely needs to protect your health as best he can. At about the same time with my wife\u2019s pregnancies, I made damn sure she only did the things she wanted and rested.", "NTA.  Your husband just won the AH of the week award. WTF?!  What kind of a useless pig wakes up a pregnant woman to berate her and then lets him mom berate her?!?!  You need to get rid of that entire family.  Take care of yourself and your children.", "Tell your husband to fuck off and his mother, too. You need to eat and drink while pregnant and sure as heck should not be taking a four-hour hike that leaves you dehydrated and sunburned. Tell your husband he better never speak to you like that again and he better put his mom in her place. This is abuse. Pack up and leave. You don't need this crap. NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat in the hell is your husband's (and the in-laws') problem?  You were exhausted and felt faint.  And you are very late in your pregnancy, when things are the most difficult.  I assume you told this to your husband.  \n\nEven if he doesn't care for you at all, which is what it seems like, he might care a little bit about your second child.  \n\nMIL is just engaging in a pissing contest of \"I'm better than you!\"  It sounds like the in-laws have always hated you, frankly.\n\nHonestly, I'd leave your husband and his abusive in-laws behind.", ">I\u2019m currently 39.5 weeks pregnant\n\n>Today my husband suggested that we all do a hike to a sea cave.
