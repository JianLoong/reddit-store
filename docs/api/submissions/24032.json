Sister Ann(f52), brother Bo(m35) and sister Cece(f30). When I was 14yo we found out Cece was actually Ann's daughter. It was a hard time for the family and the way Cece found out (gossiping neighbours) wasn't the best. \nIn the end everything got sorted and when Cece was 18 she,Ann, mom and dad sat down to talk about how it happened. From what Cece told me, Ann got pregnant with her boyfriend, he left, she had Cece and raised her for a little over a year. Then Ann met her now husband and he told her he would never accept another man's child. Ann then decided to put Cece up for adoption but my parents offered to adopt her instead of her ending up with strangers.\n\nMy parents past away in an accident 5 years ago. Cece gave birth to a lovely baby girl 6 months ago. And suddenly she started calling Ann and her husband the baby's grandparents. I admit this rubbed me the wrong way as our parents should have that title even if they aren't with us. I asked her about it and she said it's bc she wants her baby to have grand parents and not get confused by why others have them. The baby has her petarnal grand parents still alive, so I didn't buy it. After talking to her husband he told me that Ann's husband has a lot of money and if they let them call themselves grandparents he is were generous with gifts, not only to the baby but to the parents as well. \n\nI said fine, your choice. But then I don't want to be called an aunt. Bo feels the same way and has asked not to be called uncle. Now Ann and Cece are pissed and Ann has started to spread rumours about my parents forcing her to give them Cece under gun point. Which if you knew my parents and know how the legal system works is ridiculous. But now Cece has started to ask me if I really want baby to grow up without aunt and uncle. It's not like I won't be there, I just don\u2019t want them to call me aunt. AITA?\n\nEdit:\nTo make things a bit clearer. People are now assuming Ann is my mother since she is the grandmother an I'm being called aunt. With everything going on, I really don't want that connection to be made.\n\nI can also add that Cece and I have always been really close from when we were children up until 3-4 months ago.\nAnn and I have never been close. Mostly due to the age gap but also due to how she treated her daughter (not Cece).\n\nEdit 2:\nSince I'm not living in an English speaking country it can be good to know that when English have one word for aunt meaning both a older female I know, my mother's sister and my faters sister. We have 3 separate words:\nTant - an older female, can be a friend or a stranger, it's the polite way for younger ppl to address a woman older than them.\nMonster- mother's sister\nFaster- fathers sister\n\nThe title they want to use is master.

Your parents didn't care. Your sister Ann allowed it. Cece was adopted and became your legal sister and raised as such.

And on top of that, she learns that her \u2018sister\u2019 is her mother who abandoned her for a dude. How she relates to any of these people going forward is up to her and is none of your business. Frankly, getting what she can out of them monetarily and treating the relationship as transactional is a fine choice under the circumstances.\n\nBe one of the few people in her life who isn\u2019t manipulating her and just show up and be an aunt.

Her parents adopted Cece out of the goodness of their hearts. Also, I feel like this adamant stance towards not being called aunt when you are biologically the child\u2019s great aunt is only going to cause confusion in the child\u2019s life later on. \n\nEnd the cycle of pain and trauma in the family now by accepting what happened and moving forward. You refusing to have your great niece call you aunt will only exasperate things. Explain to the child when they\u2019re old enough that you are Ann\u2019s sister, Cece is your niece, and the baby is your great niece. Besides, it\u2019s not like your parents aren\u2019t still grandparents of the baby, they\u2019re just their great grandparents. If anyone hides this or misleads the child only to find out the truth later in life, they will be very traumatized.", "Would you rather be referred to as the child\u2019s great-aunt, which would be technically more accurate?\n\nFamilies are complicated, especially with big age differences and atypical parent/guardian situations.\n\nIn many cultures \u201caunt\u201d can refer to any older female family member, or even family friends. I have lots of great aunts and second cousins and stuff like that, but it\u2019s just easier to say \u201caunt\u201d.\n\nStarting rumors about your parents it\u2019s a pretty shitty thing for your Ann and Cece to do, and it\u2019s understandable to be mad about that. But I think you need to let the other things go. \n\nGrandparents, parents, great-grandparents, aunts, great-aunts, the titles don\u2019t matter. If you want to be a presence in this child\u2019s life, then you\u2019re basically her aunt. When the child is older, maybe she\u2019ll learn about the complexities of her family, and the importance of your parents, her great grandparents. They seem like wonderful people who had to deal with a tough situation, and I think maybe your grief over their passing may be manifesting as this resentment towards your sisters.\n\nI think that makes it even more important for you to let this go. What matters is being a family, whatever the labels may be. \n\nNTA, but just take some time to think about what matters. Is the title of \u201caunt\u201d the hill you want to die on? I doubt it.", "YTA. Seriously\u2026a whole lot of drama over a truth you can\u2019t avoid. You are, in fact, an aunt.  By both birth and legally.  It\u2019s just a question of degree. \n\nYou\u2019re Cece\u2019s aunt by reason of her birth to your sister.  Therefore, you are the great-aunt to any of Cece\u2019s children.  \n\nYou\u2019re also Cece\u2019s sister by reason of a legal adoption by your parents.

Because the only people you\u2019re truly going to hurt are Cece\u2019s children\u2026when they start to question why their aunt doesn\u2019t love them enough to actually be their aunt.  The questions will start long before they are able to understand the nuances surrounding their mother\u2019s birth.  And you\u2019ll just be perpetuating the pain.", "Yta.

Generally children of your sister call you aunt. \n\nHow is this even an issue\u2026?\n\nWould you prefer to be called great-aunt, so that you are known to be of Ann\u2019s generation?", "Consider that there's a chance that there is more to it than you know. Did your parents pressure her to get married? Did they encourage this child abandonment scenario? What was their relationship with Ann, given the giant age gap between her and your brother? Is there some religious fuckery underpinning the whole thing? \n\nAlso, how did your brother not remember that Cece is Ann's baby? He was 5 when she was born, 6 when she was abandoned.", "You don\u2019t. But your question wasn\u2019t about whether or not it was possible to love them without the title.  It just seems like you\u2019re trying to negate the familial connection.  And that\u2019s what you asked about\u2026would you be the AH if you refused to be called aunt.  And the story you\u2019ve given gives off an air of unresolved resentment towards your older sister that\u2019s manifesting in how you define your relationships with the others. \n\nJust calling it like I see it as an outside, uninvolved observer.  But if I was a newly introduced person into this dynamic, I\u2019d be mighty confused as to why you didn\u2019t want the children of your adopted sister to call you aunt.  Sure, it\u2019d be none of my business.  But we humans have a tendency to develop opinions about things that don\u2019t make sense and yes, form judgements about what led to that particular dynamic.  \n\nIf it works for you, go with it.  You came here for opinions on it.  Not everyone is going to agree with your reasons.  I suspect you\u2019re going to spend more time than you think explaining to various people why you\u2019re not \u201cauntie,\u201d but again, if you\u2019re good with that, more power to you.", ">Then I have two options, let ppl think she's my mother or explain the situation.\n\nYou don't actually have to explain the situation. All you need to say is \"no, Ann's not my mother\".", "Because when Cece tells me our parents isn't that important I get offended by it. If she wants to reconnect with Ann it's fine. But it shouldn't be at the cost of our parents that can't even defend themselves. And I don't want people to think Ann's my mother.", "I can understand that. I thought they had put that in the past, but I also know that major life events can make you reevaluate things and bring to surface things that has been buried.", "I think she\u2019s saying that she doesn\u2019t want to be considered a child of Ann\u2019s? Because if Ann is grandma and OP is aunt then people may think OP is Ann\u2019s daughter. She also seems to have issues with the erasure of her parents/technically Cece\u2019s grandparents that acted as parents. I agree that it\u2019s kind of ridiculous to put this much weight in titles but ultimately she has the right to be called whatever she wants. And she does intend to take on an aunt-like role, despite not wanting to be called \u201caunt.\u201d", "Who do you think you are to be dictating how she deals with the enormous trauma? This is the kind of deep fucked up family history people don't ever fully recover from. Your parents lied to her for 17 years. Only told the truth when someone else already did. Her vision of them might be different than yours. \n\nYou're that child's aunt no matter how you look at it. You can now choose to have a good relationship with your living relatives or you can go on some quest to preserve your relationship with dead relatives. Not a hard choice for most people. Choose love and empathy, hug Cece and reassure her that you're always going to be her sister no matter how she reframes her understanding of family. Tell her you can't imagine how much trauma might have resurfaced for her as a new mother.\n\nPlus, you don't even know how your parents would feel if they were alive. They might be incredibly happy to see Ann and Cece heal together to some extent.", ">Because when Cece tells me our parents isn't that important I get offended by it.\n\nIn what context was this said?\n\n>If she wants to reconnect with Ann it's fine. But it shouldn't be at the cost of our parents that can't even defend themselves. \n\nIt's not at the cost of them. \n\n>And I don't want people to think Ann's my mother.\n\nAnd I bet Cece didn't want to find out at 18 that her entire life had been a lie. Or be ostracized for acknowledging her own mother. You sound like you're being really selfish over a social confusion that's unlikely to happen often, and is easily explained away.", "Personally I think she should be consistent and call you great-aunt. She's the one that wanted more great people in the baby's life. NTA", "The fact Ann gave away her one year old, for a man, yet she now has the nerve to speak ill about your deceased parents, that raised her child\u2026 There\u2019s only 1 asshole in this story!", "So, Cece is actually your niece, making you the great aunt for her baby.\n\nYou are still the aunt and your brother is still the uncle - I mean if you insist, you can be great aunt and great uncle - but she's not wrong.", "INFO\n\nWould you prefer to be called \"Great-aunt\"? Since that's what you biologically are.\n\nYou're legally the \"Aunt.\" You're biologically the \"Great-aunt.\"\n\nSo I am not understanding your issue here.", "I think it depends on the language. An auntie in my language is tant. That's the general term that is a polite way to address a older woman. \nBut aunt, as in my mother's sister, is moster and for my brothers children I'm faster. So it's a very specific term that indicates I'm her mother's sister.", "Ann and her husband had a daughter, Ava. When Ava was 10 she was misbehaving a lot and doing poorly in school. So Ann called and asked if she could stay with me for the summer, to get away from friends with bad influence and so on. I said she could stay during my 4 weeks summer vacation. But then I couldn't take her as I didn't want a 10 yo to be home alone while I worked. That was fine.\n\nAfter the 4 weeks I called to ask when they would pick Ava up. Then they said they booked a trip to Spain for a week and could she stay that week. So my mom came and stayed with us for a week. A week turned into the whole summer, which turned into Ava transferring to a school near to me. We found out she has dyslexia and adhd. It doesn't excuse her bad behaviour, but it made it easier to find ways to deal with it.\n\nWe got a lot of excuses from Ann and her husband as why Ava couldn't move back home. In the end, I stopped asking and she lived with me until she was 19 and moved to go to university with exception for a couple of weeks here and there during breaks wen she sometimes would go to her parents. I only had a temporary guardianship of her, that was renewed every so often.", "No, my parents never liked Ann's husband. Partly due to the demand he put down, but my dad always thought he wasn't good enough, and didn't want to work and so on. When they met, her husband was broke. He got his money about 8-10 years ago as an inheritance. My dad got him a job at the company where he worked when Ann got pregnant with their daughter because my dad didn't want Ann supporting both of them while pregnant. \n\nNeither of my parent were religious. My dad was a real softy. Alway did what mom told him, had the biggest heart, but had the opinion that you always do what is right by others and there are no shortcuts. My mother was really lovely women, she was the one  wearing the pants in the family andcwe all respected her, but in a good way.\n\nAnn and my parents seemed to have a good relationship,  Ann and her husband lived 10 min walk from us and we would have Sunday dinner together every week. My mother was quite protective of Ann, especially after everything came out. She didn't want anyone to blame Ann. She always said that until we had to make such decisions we shouldn't judge.  I never managed to live up to that. When they left their daughter with me when se was 10, my dad called Ann's husband and yelled at him for not being there for her. Its the only time I have ever heard him raise his voice. But a couple of weeks later, my mother had managed to get everyone talking civily to each other again.\n\nFrom what I know I don't think they wanted to take on a fourth child. They were both in their late 40's and with 3 children under the age of 6 I couldn't been easy. We didn't have a lot of money so I can see them having to think about it before choosing to adopt Cece. At the same time, I don't think they ever would have chosen differently.\n\nMy brother says he has some memories that he now when he knows Ann is Cece's bio mom can relate to that. But we are a close family so for him to remember Ann with Cece is not that strange and knowing him, he would just not care about a thing like that.", "Why is Ann still in yall's lives? She just keep getting pregnant and giving up her kids?", "Jesus. Ann (and her husband) are really just peaches, aren't they?", "Unfortunately at the moment people do confuse Ann for being my mother every so often. Like the other day at work a colleague that knows both me and Cece, but not that well, told me she had met my mother at the market. Besides from me not wanting to be Ann's daughter, it's quite unnerving to have someone say that when my mother is dead. It takes me a minute or two to connect the dotts.", "When I asked how our parents figured in to this and what Cece would tell baby about them she told me they weren't important, and since they are dead she won't be talking that much about them anyway.\n\nIt is at their cost. Because now my sisters, mostly Ann, are spreading rumours about them which in my opinion is a horrible thing to do.\n\nFirst, she was 14, not 18. And yes, it was a mistake, which my parents and Ann all admitted. And they spent years trying to heal.\n\nIt is happening often, and not just at family gatherings anymore. I get people at work telling me they met my mother the other day at the market. And do I then have the right to explain the misunderstanding? Does Cece want strangers knowing all of this? Should I respect her right to keep this private or should I just tell everyone?\n\nWhy is it so important that I have the title of aunt? I won't love the baby less if she calls me OP instead of aunt. I don\u2019t think she will love me less. But we won't have to deal with all of this complicated things that is keeping wounds open and causing friction unnecessary.", ">When I asked how our parents figured in to this and what Cece would tell baby about them she told me they weren't important, and since they are dead she won't be talking that much about them anyway.\n\nSo she was specifically talking about their importance to this situation. That doesn't mean they're not important. Just that they don't figure into this specific situation. \n\nIs she pretending that Ann raised her? If not, she'll probably mention them when telling old stories. But it's only normal to talk to children about people they know more than you talk about deceased ones.. even if they were super important to you. \n\n>It is at their cost. Because now my sisters, mostly Ann, are spreading rumours about them which in my opinion is a horrible thing to do.\n\nYes, that is a horrible thing to do. But that's not what I was talking about. According to your post that happened after you rejected the title of aunt. You seemed to be saying that calling her mother the grandmother of her children is at the cost of your parents. And I am saying that it is not. \n\nSpreading rumours about your parents would be at their cost, but that's not actually the same situation as naming her mother her mother. \n\n>First, she was 14, not 18. And yes, it was a mistake, which my parents and Ann all admitted.\n\nAdmitting a mistake doesn't fix it.\n\nYou said **you** were 14 when you found out. And that she sat down with everyone about it at 18. So either she found out two years after you and your brother, or you can't keep the numbers straight in your story. Which makes me doubt it's veracity. \n\n>It is happening often, and not just at family gatherings anymore. I get people at work telling me they met my mother the other day at the market.\n\nI buy this story even less now. At family gatherings they were confused about who your mother was?? Really? And multiple people at your work somehow know your niece well enough to recognise her while she's out with Ann and get introduced to her? \n\n>Should I respect her right to keep this private or should I just tell everyone?\n\n\"Ann is not my mother\" is a full response and covers every situation. I now don't believe this post at all, but in the vague chance it's real, the solutions aren't hard, you're just making them hard because you're upset.", "I guess technically that would make you a great aunt. Why not go with that title?", "Have you asked your sister Ann why she is making the claim that your forced her to give up her child when she did to keep her husband?  If her parents hadn't stepped up then CeCe would not even be a part of your family.  Does Cece even know that Ann is saying that?  I'm going with not NTA b/c it's outrageous to me that Ann is now claiming that her parents forced her to give them her child when she was going to adopt Cece out to strangers just to keep a man.", "I think I'm gonna have to vote NAH, on a superficial level. If you don't want to be called \"aunt,\" you don't have to be called \"aunt.\" But I can't disagree with Cece.\n\nWhen my stepsiblings started having kids, my mom decided she wanted to be \"Mimi.\" My stepdad's ex is still in the picture, so they had someone to fill that \"grandma\" name. Over the years, my mom has become another \"Grandma,\" but that's irrelevant to my current point. \n\nI will say that I don't understand your reasoning. So your parents fill the role of great-grandparents instead of grandparents. There's still love and respect with that title. I don't feel like there's any disrespect intended.\n\nBiologically speaking, yes, you're their GREAT-aunt instead of their aunt. But do you want that to be how they refer to you? It's so formal and uncomfortable, at least in my opinion. But again, that's your decision. \n\nMy mom met her best friend when I was already in my teens. I knew this woman was my mom's best friend and not family. I was still a kid, but old enough to know, understand, and respect the difference between friends and family. But if they had met when I was younger, I guarantee she would be Aunt (insert name here). My kid calls her Grandma (insert name here). I think you might be putting too much weight into the title.", "YTA so literally her bio mother is being called grandma, her step father is being called grandpa.  They have found peace with these roles that don\u2019t involve you at all.  Why are you involving yourself? Mind your own life.\n\nAlso yes you\u2019re the baby\u2019s great aunt.  That\u2019s how that works.", "So he didn't want to raise another man's child.\n\nAnd then he didn't raise his own child.\n\nSo Ann gave away two of her children for this husband of hers.\n\nNo man is worth that in my book. But clearly Ann lives her life by a different book."]}
