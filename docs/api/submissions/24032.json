Sister Ann(f52), brother Bo(m35) and sister Cece(f30). When I was 14yo we found out Cece was actually Ann's daughter. It was a hard time for the family and the way Cece found out (gossiping neighbours) wasn't the best. \nIn the end everything got sorted and when Cece was 18 she,Ann, mom and dad sat down to talk about how it happened. From what Cece told me, Ann got pregnant with her boyfriend, he left, she had Cece and raised her for a little over a year. Then Ann met her now husband and he told her he would never accept another man's child. Ann then decided to put Cece up for adoption but my parents offered to adopt her instead of her ending up with strangers.\n\nMy parents past away in an accident 5 years ago. Cece gave birth to a lovely baby girl 6 months ago. And suddenly she started calling Ann and her husband the baby's grandparents. I admit this rubbed me the wrong way as our parents should have that title even if they aren't with us. I asked her about it and she said it's bc she wants her baby to have grand parents and not get confused by why others have them. The baby has her petarnal grand parents still alive, so I didn't buy it. After talking to her husband he told me that Ann's husband has a lot of money and if they let them call themselves grandparents he is were generous with gifts, not only to the baby but to the parents as well. \n\nI said fine, your choice. But then I don't want to be called an aunt. Bo feels the same way and has asked not to be called uncle. Now Ann and Cece are pissed and Ann has started to spread rumours about my parents forcing her to give them Cece under gun point. Which if you knew my parents and know how the legal system works is ridiculous. But now Cece has started to ask me if I really want baby to grow up without aunt and uncle. It's not like I won't be there, I just don\u2019t want them to call me aunt.

Almost no one ever calls their great aunt great aunt. I literally know one person who does this and his siblings don\u2019t even do it.", "Most great aunts get called aunt. It sounds like you have a lot of opinions that didn't need to be shared. Cece wants her children to have grandparents. And they do. Ann is that baby's grandmother. Her husband doesn't deserve the title, as he encouraged his wife to abandon her baby. But if Cece can get over that, you definitely should!!", "NAH. Sounds like there\u2019s been a lot of hurt and pain and secrets in your family. I understand where you\u2019re coming from; you want your sweet parents memory and importance to not be diminished. But I would ask you, aren\u2019t y\u2019all ready to let go of all of this? Start over. Clean slate. Don\u2019t let the pain make you petty. What\u2019s really wrong with this kid calling the adults in her life aunt, grandma, grandpa, whatever? This could be a great opportunity to end some family cycles. I\u2019d urge you to think about whether or not you\u2019re actually honoring your parents by all of you causing unnecessary drama. You\u2019re choosing to die on a hill that doesn\u2019t matter; honor your parents by continuing their love, not this prideful, stubborn pettiness. I wish you all peace and healing.", "NTA, not wanting people to assume your sister is your mom is ok and yeah kids can adres family members by their first name (the wife of my grandfather has always been first name to me and that never caused issues) and depending on how you brought this news to Ann/Cece they should accept that and not turn it into a big issue", "NTA - You are upset because your sister Ann abandon Cece for a man  who wouldn't accept a child because it wasn't biologically his and your parents willing took on another child (Cece), adopted her, and raised her like their own, despite the fact the child wasn't biologically theirs but their technical grandchild. Your parents didn't care. Your sister Ann allowed it. Cece was adopted and became your legal sister and raised as such. You now feel hurt that she want's to disregard your parents and the role they played in her life over money. You probably feel she is ungrateful for everything that your parents did for her because she prefers money from a man who never has or will accept her as his child the way your parents did. He literately sooner see her adopted out to a stranger instead and your sister agreed, yet she choosing their money now. I would be hurt too and probably would say the same thing.", "INFO: I read this post 3 times and still don't understand why you have a problem being called aunt? Do you wanna be called great-aunt instead? I don't get it.", "YTA, but I mean that gently. Clearly there's a lot of pain here, but technically you are a great-aunt (which I think most people just call aunt), and there's no need for you to share this familial pain onto the next generation. Why not be a supportive and caring aunt (or technically great-aunt) for a new baby?", "INFO: Do you not want the baby (eventually child) to call you \u201caunt\u201d or are you saying you don\u2019t want CeCe (the person whose 2 years younger than you and was a sibling to you) to call you aunt?", "I mean - I understand where your mindset is but technically (biologically) speaking\u2026.Ann is the grandmother and you and your brother are great-aunt and uncle.\n\nIs there a reason your parents can\u2019t also be honored as grandparents?  At some point the child will be old enough to comprehend they had another set of grandparents that died before she was born.\n\nAnd how hard is it to tell people CeCe is my niece - she was adopted by my parents and raised as our sister?  I get that it\u2019s frustrating but your family dynamic really isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s business.", "YTA. You seem to have astonishingly little empathy for what your sister was put through. It\u2019s nice that you want to honor your parent\u2019s memory, but your parents also lied to Cece her whole life about who she was and didn\u2019t even own up to it until forced to by rumors. And on top of that, she learns that her \u2018sister\u2019 is her mother who abandoned her for a dude. How she relates to any of these people going forward is up to her and is none of your business. Frankly, getting what she can out of them monetarily and treating the relationship as transactional is a fine choice under the circumstances.\n\nBe one of the few people in her life who isn\u2019t manipulating her and just show up and be an aunt. That\u2019s what you are.", "NTA   I understand.  You are honoring and respecting your deceased parents.", "Yta. Technically you are a great aunt to this child. You\u2019re arguing over a familiar title you essentially have", "ESH. Why is Ann spreading rumors about your parents when she was one willing to put Cece up for adoption? Her parents adopted Cece out of the goodness of their hearts. Also, I feel like this adamant stance towards not being called aunt when you are biologically the child\u2019s great aunt is only going to cause confusion in the child\u2019s life later on. \n\nEnd the cycle of pain and trauma in the family now by accepting what happened and moving forward. You refusing to have your great niece call you aunt will only exasperate things. Explain to the child when they\u2019re old enough that you are Ann\u2019s sister, Cece is your niece, and the baby is your great niece. Besides, it\u2019s not like your parents aren\u2019t still grandparents of the baby, they\u2019re just their great grandparents. If anyone hides this or misleads the child only to find out the truth later in life, they will be very traumatized.", "Would you rather be referred to as the child\u2019s great-aunt, which would be technically more accurate?\n\nFamilies are complicated, especially with big age differences and atypical parent/guardian situations.\n\nIn many cultures \u201caunt\u201d can refer to any older female family member, or even family friends. I have lots of great aunts and second cousins and stuff like that, but it\u2019s just easier to say \u201caunt\u201d.\n\nStarting rumors about your parents it\u2019s a pretty shitty thing for your Ann and Cece to do, and it\u2019s understandable to be mad about that. But I think you need to let the other things go. \n\nGrandparents, parents, great-grandparents, aunts, great-aunts, the titles don\u2019t matter. If you want to be a presence in this child\u2019s life, then you\u2019re basically her aunt. When the child is older, maybe she\u2019ll learn about the complexities of her family, and the importance of your parents, her great grandparents. They seem like wonderful people who had to deal with a tough situation, and I think maybe your grief over their passing may be manifesting as this resentment towards your sisters.\n\nI think that makes it even more important for you to let this go. What matters is being a family, whatever the labels may be. \n\nNTA, but just take some time to think about what matters. Is the title of \u201caunt\u201d the hill you want to die on? I doubt it.", "YTA. Seriously\u2026a whole lot of drama over a truth you can\u2019t avoid. You are, in fact, an aunt.  By both birth and legally.  It\u2019s just a question of degree. \n\nYou\u2019re Cece\u2019s aunt by reason of her birth to your sister.  Therefore, you are the great-aunt to any of Cece\u2019s children.  \n\nYou\u2019re also Cece\u2019s sister by reason of a legal adoption by your parents.  Therefore, you\u2019re the aunt to any of her children.  \n\nGreat-aunt and/or aunt\u2026this is an irrefutable truth which you are choosing to renounce because you\u2019re butt-hurt Cece is choosing to call her biological mother a grandmother to her child.\n\nWhatever relationship Ann and Cece decide to define for themselves doesn\u2019t change any of the facts of your relationship with those children.  And really has nothing to do with you.  You need to get out of the middle of this.  Because the only people you\u2019re truly going to hurt are Cece\u2019s children\u2026when they start to question why their aunt doesn\u2019t love them enough to actually be their aunt.  The questions will start long before they are able to understand the nuances surrounding their mother\u2019s birth.  And you\u2019ll just be perpetuating the pain.", "Yta.

My parents and grandparents always told me so many stories about my great-grandparents or other family members that were no longer with us and that I never got to know.
