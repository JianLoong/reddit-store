You know he\u2019s a bad guy and behaves like a ridiculous child. Tell your fianc\u00e9 that you\u2019re setting this boundary, and they need to respect it.

This should be a conversation between you and your fiance. Where he can choose your happiness at your own wedding over placating friend and mom. Having to worry about Ian's behavior leading up to the wedding is obviously already causing anxiety and  then if he did do something day of I'm sure that would leave a bad taste after. So basically Ian would color everything. If your fiance can't see this, he is starting his marriage off in the wrong direction.", "Agree completely.
