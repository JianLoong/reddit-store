She needs to solve the situation herself if it was between a reasonable time then sure otherwise the person who posted this said there is a 24/7 open office where she can get a key so therefore she should have gone there. And also as stated the roomate saw her sleeping and was being completely inconsiderate.", "NTA. Part of college is learning how to handle adult responsibilities, like remembering where your own shit is. Accidents happen, but this is carelessness. If I misplace my work key into my office it\u2019s considered a security threat and I\u2019m in big trouble. I\u2019m happy I learned how to manage my stuff when the consequences were much lower. \n\nI\u2019m surprised she\u2019s been able to get so many new keys? When I was in college it was like $50 to get a new dorm key, if I remember correctly. It was the cost to get a new one for yourself and you had to replace your roommates. Granted they were actual keys, not cards like people have now but still! I\u2019m pretty against universities charging students out the ass but I know the costs associated with replacing our keys did make us keep track of them. \n\nAs far as her attitude goes, hopefully she will perk back up after the semester break (assuming you have one). I remember things would get tense with my roommates around finals but after a few weeks of getting some space we were usually always excited to come back and see each other again. Dorm life is tough and while this is super annoying, count your blessings if this is the worst thing she does! \n\nI do recommend talking to her if this continues to be a problem. Looking back a lot of conflicts with my roommates could have been handled much better if we would have handled it like adults instead of being passive aggressive.

I'd try to change the roommate, she sounds awful. And tell her it's not okay to wake you up at 5 am during the finals week (seriously, she saw you're sleeping and turned the lights on? Sorry but she's an idiot). Mine did similar stuff and at first I looked over that but it became impossible to deal with. Your RM is insanely disrespectful.", "NTA. Some people have to learn the hard way.", "NTA that's so obnoxious, I would not be very nice to her at that point", "NTA.\n\nBut put your phone in airplane mode before you go to sleep, so that you don't receive calls.\n\nOr maybe just block her number.", "NTA ur roommate is a fool", "NTA I would have done this too.", "NTA.\n\nDo I think this was the most mature reaction, no I don't. To be honest, you should have adressed this issue weeks ago and please stop being her butler. You are not. You are a roommate with your own life and you do not have to accomodate to her every whim.\n\nLuckily, you are 19 and she is 18. So both can still learn. So from now on, communicate your boundaries and stick to them. Be firm with her. When you are in your room, ofcourse you can let her in when you are awake during normal hours (for example between 8am and 10pm). When you are in your room, ofcourse you can look if you see her key or wallet. Those are all situations where you can help, because you have the possibility to help. Everything else is a firm \"No, please see the residence help desk. I am not in the possibility to help.\" and keep repeating that untill she hears it.\n\nWill she learn. That is the question only time can tell. However you are not responsible for her. You are responsible for yourself, your own boundaries and communicating those boundaries.

I went through a very similar situation when I was in college, except my roommate refused to take her key and wanted us to keep the door unlocked (keep in mind the semester before a girl was assaulted in her dorm room by a visitor when her door was unlocked.) Her reasoning was her keychain was too bulky and she didn\u2019t want to take it off, so she couldn\u2019t lock the door. Like seriously? I did the exact same thing and pretended to sleep when she was locked out one night. She learned her lesson though.", "NTA.

Could\u2019ve been an emergency. I guarantee your RM didn\u2019t think you slept thru all that whether she mentioned it or not.

I started faking sleep and locking my doors because they would always bother me for a ride to or from wherever they were going. I didn\u2019t feel bad ignoring because I knew they weren\u2019t dumb enough to drink and drive. Ultimately, I moved in with someone else the following year because I was tired of being guilted into something I didn\u2019t feel responsible for. All that to say, you\u2019re NTA.

I immediately purchased a key holder to hang on my doorknob to lock in spare keys. You can also get locking keyholders that can be attached to your home.

When my girlfriend and I were vacationing she kept getting annoyed at how much I checked, double checked, and triple checked that we had the keys and everything else with us.

As in, these people *do* have adhd but turn it into their whole personality and display a high level of, what I would term, purposeful carelessness. It takes a long time but with the benefits of medication it's very possible to build systems and train yourself out of bad habits accumulated from a lifetime with adhd. There are many people with adhd who you wouldn't even guess have it because they've put in the effort to do so. Most of the people who are very obviously adhd either have yet to be diagnosed or do it on purpose.", "Yes, but OP let it get to this point without sharing her frustrations.

And it was a sketchy lock, i struggled everytime when using it, and on top of that the key was small and soft metal like the ones you get with 2 dollar padlock from supermarket. I was scared that it will broke inside the lock. I couldnt believe it was legal but i guess it was almost a default, it was quite new building and not even student apartment or anything.", "I heard of one resident that had their roommate take their key by accident and had to call to be let out of the apt. They tried to force her to pay the fee for losing her key. She was like I was inside my apt and I will not pay to leave. They backed down. I\u2019ve been debating on contacting them.

In every place I\u2019ve lived at you can turn a knob to lock or unlock it from inside so you don\u2019t need a key to leave while the door is locked, but when you leave the door is unlocked unless you turn the key. Like usually the house is on fire I don\u2019t have to find a key to leave\u2026 I do currently bc literally can\u2019t leave if the door is locked without smashing though some glass or having the key. Different situations.  Sounds like your roommates are enabling that shit.", "From a quick google search it looks like some places accept anon fire code violations. It should be worth it checking how your city handles it. \n\nIdk how anyone in power to make such a decision could be this fucking stupid. They deserve all the trouble they will get on a report.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOut of curiosity, roughly how man people live in that building, that would die in a fire, because the people that remembered to grab their key, when running for their lives, cant get past the panicked crowd, to use it?", "Not an apt building exactly. No crowds. Alright so like a townhome or rowhome. Long building. Door opens to four apts. Two downstairs and two upstairs. All two storeys . Downstairs neighbors can leave by flipping their lock without a key, but upstairs can\u2019t. Really weird.  It\u2019s a large complex of buildings and not all are the same, but mostly. My building is long and has around 18-20 apts in the same connected building.", "NTA Why TF would you go across campus for her when she won't walk a block for herself? Sweetie, you have taken the first step in learning not to be a doormat for the rest of your life. Own it proudly. Never do squat for her again. Tell her to put on her big girl panties and take her damn key with her. They make lanyards with extend-a-cords so that it doesn't have to leave her neck. Even in the shower.", "I'm not sure your university's rules, but I've always heard that people can request room changes and typically have them honored if something is available.", "Nah..she's a pain the ass. Your doing her a favor!", "don't stand the nonsense", "Nah you\u2019re good.", "NTA\n\nMy freshman year one of my roommates insisted her key didn\u2019t work. She was foreign and seemed nice so I showed her how the key works, you had to turn it fairly hard, and figured we were good.\n\nShe continued to insist that her key didn\u2019t work and complained that she was locked out.\n\nShe didn\u2019t sleep in our room much. I remember on one occasion she was actually in our room and I was going to take a shower. I normally would just leave the door unlocked, but I grabbed my key just in case, and walked out with my towel.\n\nI can back, and yep, she had locked me out. She looked shocked when I opened the door.\n\nWe were at a conservative Christian college so I think her parents sent her there to convert her or something. As a result, she disliked just about everyone there and finally got a formal room change 2nd semester.", "Nope NTA. That girl needs to get her priorities in order and realise that you\u2019re not her SLAVE.", "NTA. She set herself up for this. And if she knows she's bad w remembering her keys she should've gotten one of those card holder lanyards. She's an adult, ur not responsible for her stupidity O.P.. Sorry you're going through that girl :')", "NTA.  You are not responsible for her in any way.  I think that what you did by feigning sleep was a good thing, if passive-aggressive.   For once, you weren't immediately available.  She counts on that so shut it down.  \n\nIf you keep getting up to let her in, you are enabling her to live irresponsibly and you are her doormat.", "I swear I've read this before", "NTA in my book. We all need to do favors for the people we live with. We need to express appreciation when we receive favors. And we need to avoid running our need for favors into the ground. Your roommate is inconsiderate by failing to take responsibility for herself. Of course she would rather have you run across campus than walk a block herself. In your own interest, you need to start saying no. As in, *Sorry, I can\u2019t come right now. I will be back in a few hours*. And tear her a new one when she causes your card not to work.", "NTA. Your roommate sounds rude and inconsiderate. It's past time for her to learn to have her keys. This seems like at home someone was always catering her when she didnt have the key and now she thinks everyone should do the same", "NTA \n\nI might have thought differently if you lived in a house off-campus in a not-so-safe part of town and she was locked out after midnight during freezing weather. But she was in the building and therefore safe, and had options to deal with being locked out that wouldn\u2019t put her in danger. \n\nYour roommate is rude (switching on all the lights is a no-no in dorm life/shared rooming) and chronically disorganized. To be blunt: she needs to grow the fuck up and get her shit sorted. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even entertain addressing this with her, outside of saying you slept through her call because you\u2019ve been pulling long hours studying. And only that if she brings it up.", "NTA. She has other options available and instead assumes she can count on you to always make up for what she\u2019s lacking.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t change your behavior, she won\u2019t change hers. The system was working for her, so why would she do anything differently? The system wasn\u2019t working for you, so it was beyond time for you to do something different. Don\u2019t backslide and let her call you to let her in again.", "NTA. She needs to stop expecting you to drop everything to fix her problems and waking you up in the middle on the night is not okay. \n\nThe next time she pulls something like this, ignore her request for help and instead send her a link to some reading on the importance of respecting others\u2019 boundaries.", "your ages indicate freshmen.  her mom used to all this for her probably. now she needs a new mom.  refuse the assignment.", "NTA - you should request a room change, think of having to put up with this for another whole semester?", "NTA, but I probably would have let her in after the crying and laid down the law/had a talk with her as that\u2019s a great opportunity to do so while she\u2019s still feeling hurt from the consequences. I think she knew you weren\u2019t actually asleep esp after knocking and then she cried. But NTA. I\u2019m forgetful, had to have my dorm key replaced 3-5 times while in dorm living, but I never made it my roommates problem.", "NTA, She does things that annoys you while you are trying to do other things, she is inconsiderate of how you feel, she doesn't want to be roommates she wants to cause mischief and wants to get away with it, I would suggest going to talk to the RA about her", "NTA but it is probably time for a hard conversation with her.   Of course she's thoughtless and disrespectful, part of her growing up may be hearing the truth.  You need some boundries.  Keep in mind it isn't her job to set or protect your boundries, it's yours.   Perhaps look for a different roommate in the new semester?", "As a former RA, no you\u2019re NTA. The number is always given or promoted to students and most of the time there is a notice of who is on duty. Your friend kinda is", "Nope. Sometimes lessons are hard to learn.", "NTA, and start sleeping with earplugs.

It is Finals Week and your roommate is a jerk, and has been a jerk all semester or year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust because the phone rings or someone knocks, you don't have to answer. That's why you have voicemail. More to the point, your roommate has other ways to get into the room, other than having their f-ing key on them.   \n\n\nYou aren't their butler, nor their paid concierge. Having their key is their responsibility. I hope you have a better roommate next year.", "Loved this \ud83d\ude02, NTA.", "Nta", "NTA - You're not your roommates keeper. She needs to grow up and become a responsible adult that can be polite and considerate of others. She won't change unless there is some tension in her life . . . as long as she has you at her beck and call she won't try harder to remember her things.", "ESH - clearly she\u2019s a bad roommate, but ignoring her for that long, including sounds that you think might be crying, is not how to solve this issue. You\u2019re both adults, try having an adult conversation instead of being passive aggressive in the early hours of the morning when she\u2019s potentially in crisis.", "NTA NTA NTA. \nOooof big feel for me. Former RA here: people will absolutely take advantage of you being nice and letting them in without whatever hassle/potential fees theyre *supposed* to go through. \nMy university had a policy where you got 3 free borrows of a spare room key through your rsd per year or semester, don\u2019t remember. After those 3, you had to pay for the lock to be changed on your room which was ~100-140$, also don\u2019t remember exactly. \nOutside of RSD hours, or if your RA was nice/a pushover such as myself, the RA could access a master key at any time, to open any resident door in the building. \nYou were only supposed to ask the RA if RSD was closed, but there would only be one RSD per every 2-3 buildings, so often people would just go straight to the RA if the RSD wasn\u2019t in your building. \nThe RA was *supposed* to fill out a form with your name and the date/time, and submitting it would charge you a fine of i think 20$ the first time, and 40$ every time after that.\n\nProblem is I\u2019m like, fuck the man. I don\u2019t see any of this money, why am I going to spend the extra 5 minutes filling out paperwork to buy the school that blatantly tries to underpay us an extra 20-40 bucks, when I\u2019m trying to cultivate a positive relationship w these people?\n\nOh boy. It was even worse, I was the *first floor* RA, which meant that half the building crossed my door on their way in/out of the building, plus I was the closest to the RA office, which held the skeleton keys, making me the most logical pick. \nAnother painful point of contention was that my co-RA, the first floor RA on the other side, scarcely ever slept in their own room. So folks who tried their door first, would then go to mine. I was awoken by the same handful of people (sheepishly) on repeat at 2-5 am (summoned earlier as well, but not usually awoken) for a semester and change before I finally put my foot down and started filling out the damn paperwork for any repeat offenders. I joked about the prospect of taking bribes, as I could\u2019ve made a bunch charging people 10 instead of 20, or 20 instead of the ultimate 40 with how often I was awoken (while not on duty/on-call, mind yall), but unfortunately had too much of a damn moral compass. \nAnywho, you wouldn\u2019t believe how fast people who had repeatedly so genuinely apologized for just being unable to remember their keys, suddenly gained the ability. I only wish the RAs got to keep those lil bonuses, having gotten up in the night to work for them, instead of padding the corrupt administration. But they were certainly more effective.\n\nRant over. Tl;dr: ra resentfully accepts university lockout fee as effective, if bastardly.", "YTA - it was just unnecessary what you did.  Honestly, everything else about the roommate is beside the point - you could settle all those issues with a simple conversation.  \n\nAll you need to know about this is, one time, they were locked out, you believed they were distressed, and you left them hanging there on purpose - that makes you an asshole - \n\nA person who chooses to do the shitty thing and justifies it any way they can (including seeking confirmatory feedback here) to not feel bad is... an asshole.", "This sub is severely lacking in empathy and grace.\n\nESH.\n\nYou have a shitty roommate and you suck for not taking the ten seconds to let her in. It takes zero effort not to be an asshole and you decided to endure several phone calls and five minutes of obnoxious, loud ass knocking just to spite them.\n\nIf the sub\u2019s consensus is that she needs to learn the hard way to not lose her stuff, I\u2019m sure everyone agrees that if the roommate locks her out one day to teach her how to empathize, it\u2019s all good?", "I would say communication is key, but the switching on the lights while you were asleep is too much, she doesn't respect you, NTA", "Yeah, OP, it's time to send a text. \"You've forgotten your key and asked me to let you in no less than X times. I will no longer be doing that, so please bring your key with you when you leave, or talk to the BLANK when you get locked out.\" Then, stick to your boundaries.", "Yeah, people not understanding doors is a deal-breaker for me.", "Definitely, but I'd put this conversation aside for next time it happens again. For now OP \"was just asleep.\"", "Nope if anything it should have been a valuable lesson to the roomate that they op isn\u2019t there for them, and their constant screw ups. They easily could have gotten an ra to open the door the whole time but resorted to acting like a child.

She\u2019s an adult now and needs to be more responsible. Not your job to keep track of her keys and let her in.", "I think mine had 1 free pass a semester, and then they would start charging increasing amounts for every time we got locked out. We had an odd situation of renovated dorms had auto-lock room doors unless we flipped a lever sort of thing in them, while the non-renovated dorm doors had to be manually locked. No one thought to mention that to the people swapping from unrenovated to renovated, or to incoming residents. My first dorm had just been renovated over the summer before I arrived, and my roommate (a sophomore) apparently learned about the change the hard way, and then had to be extra-careful the rest of the semester.", "That's just it, there's a way to do it. I always have keys, phone and wallet in my pockets. They each take a pocket and I can feel it missing. I find making a simple structure system means less steps to forget and if I'm bugged out it has become habitual.

Plus a lot of the rooms had communal bathrooms, so there was a high chance that you would end up forgetting your key when you'd gone out wearing a bathrobe or pajamas or something, and have to do a few minutes walk outside over to the porters lodge to borrow the spare key for your room.\n\nOn the other hand, at least we didn't have to share bedrooms.", "This is why I almost don\u2019t mind. Can\u2019t forget my keys if I can\u2019t leave my apt without them. Though my roommate couldn\u2019t find her keys and was in a rush and I spent the next like 4 hours locked inside.
