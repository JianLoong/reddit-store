This wouldn\u2019t be an issue if it wasn\u2019t such a common occurrence for her to expect me to run across campus for her or let her in at early hours (all while being very unappreciative of whenever I let her in).

She has also on multiple occasions given me no warning before replacing her key and in the process demagnetising mine. This is slightly annoying because when I get back from a three hour lab I would like to be able to fix my key before I get to my room and realise I can\u2019t open the door. Over reading week she also called me numerous times asking me to search for her wallet and key in the room, even though I had told her and texted her that night that I was at home (hours away from the university).

I looked at my phone and when I saw it was her, I muted it, figuring she was trying to get me to let her back into our room.

After five minutes she started calling my name and it almost sounded like she was crying in the hall. It is exam season, so quiet hours were in effect especially strictly. Eventually someone else let her in, probably the RA (resident assistant) on duty or our RA down the hall.

Definitely NTA. I mean hell, sometimes when residents who frequently forget their keys call me - the literal RA on call - at irritating hours, I\u2019ll take as long as i need to get there. Sometimes sitting in the hall and waiting for fifteen-twenty minutes will teach them a lesson. \n\nYou\u2019re not the RA. It\u2019s not your job to let your roommate in, especially at 5 in the morning during finals week. Besides, she\u2019s a damn adult. She\u2019s gotta start remembering her key or she\u2019s gonna have a rough time as soon as she gets her own place. It sounds like someone, maybe yourself or an RA or a staff member, needs to have a sit down talk with your roommate about why she keeps forgetting her key.", "NTA, she should just ask the administration for help getting in instead of disturbing your sleep at such an early hour and then crying like a child lmao", "NTA. She needs to learn responsibilities and to grow up. You're not her mother. She is disturbing your study, rest and personal time. I want her to move out and I don't live with her. I would suggest buying a sleep mask and ear plugs or a comfy headphones that will block out all of her rukus. Can you discuss this with the RA or someone so that they do not deactivate your key? You need a better roommate.", "Even having the second option as an RA that can let her in I believe your NTA. She needs to get her life sorted out, probably go see a doctor about ADHD or something. Sure it is nice to have someone to help, but ADHD isn't an excuse to be a burden to someone else. Far from the asshole here", "Sit down and have a conversation with her.  Obviously she is used to someone taking care of her and that is not your job.  Let her know you are done participating in her learned helplessness and key issues.", "Alas, I would have done the same thing, probably\u2026", "She deserved it.", "NTA. Also I wouldn't have crossed campus even once to let her in. Live your life and her being unable to get in is her problem.", "I have done this 3-4 times and still my roommate doesnt understand, someone save me please\ud83e\udee0", "NTA. Sounds like your living situation is almost at boiling point though. You need to sit down and talk with her and set our some expectations for living together. Failing that, I'd see if I could get paired with a different roommate next semester.", "NTA. If I was in your place, I would have done the same thing.", "Nta Tell her to get a Samsung tag or a apple tag or some shit to stop loosing her keys", "ESH. Her behavior sucks, but you could have had a conversation with her and lay down your boundaries instead of doing what you did. I don\u2019t really fault you for it much though. \n\nShe\u2019s clearly not a friend for life. Just be civil, get through it and get a new roommate next year.", "NTA", "ESH: She needs to be responsible and bring her key. You thought you were teaching her a lesson by ignoring her, but just made yourself look bad.", "YTA. It's college. Lighten up.", "YTA bc I think you can deal with the situation but in a different way. The cases of you going across campus to let her in and her not being appreciative is very annoying I def don\u2019t blame you. I think if she messages you in times of that where you\u2019re studying or hanging out with friends then don\u2019t answer her. But being in the room I would\u2019ve just opened it especially after the crying. I think you should have a meeting with your RA and her to tell her how you feel.", "YTA it takes 5 seconds to help someone out.

I ended up getting a tiny purse that goes over my shoulder.  Keys are clipped to the strap, wallet with everything and phone stay in the purse when I am out.

She needs to solve the situation herself if it was between a reasonable time then sure otherwise the person who posted this said there is a 24/7 open office where she can get a key so therefore she should have gone there. And also as stated the roomate saw her sleeping and was being completely inconsiderate."]}
