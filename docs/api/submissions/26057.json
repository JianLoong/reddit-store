When he's on his medication, he functions normally. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed in his 20s and thinks nothing is wrong with him so he doesn't take his medication. I have another brother who passed away a few years ago, during that time my family asked me to move back home because they wanted me to be there. I was already moving due to COVID so I said I would because it would give me a chance to save for a house and finish college. After I moved in, my family pushed my brothers care solely onto me. I had to drop out of college because I was afraid my professor and other students would hear my brother having an episode (online classes due to covid), I've lost jobs because my brother would keep me up all night for days straight and I couldn't function properly or wake up in time for work. The only thing I'm able to do is call the cops/ambulance when it gets really bad so police/paramedics can admit him to a psychiatric hospital. In the 3 years I've lived here, I have called and handled him every time with no help from my family. My brother is an adult so if he refuses help they won't take him and I'm stuck having to deal with by myself. I've had times where I left my room to find my brother having a seizure on the floor and not breathing to him destroying things and threatening me. On top of this, my family constantly asks me for money and to buys stuff for the house. I've paid over $10,000 this year just helping with bills. It's gotten to the point where I am incredibly burnt out and want to leave. I love my brother and family but it's gotten to be too much and I can't progress or move forward. I've started to grow resentment towards my parents because they won't do anything. They're both trying to convince me to take over power of attorney because they're \"too old\". My mother has helped out with bills but hasn't done much to help my brother. My father hasn't done anything at all.

I'd like to give some clarification, I have made multiple plans to get out but most of them have fallen through. I just lost my job due to one of my brothers episodes. Before losing it, I had been approved for a mortgage and was actively looking for houses so I could move out. I told my parents that I was not letting anyone move in with me. As much as I want to get out, I still need to find another job comparable or better than the wage I previously had. Both mortgage and an apartment requires you to have a job and be working for at least 2 months before you can get anything. This has set me back on finding a house/apartment. I previously worked in the medical field for 9 years. I have a lot of experience but the medical field where I live doesn't pay much so I've had to leave my field and move onto something else. I'm wanting to go back to college for software or computer engineering. I had previously been working on a medical degree but I have enough credits to let me complete a engineering degree in 1 year. All of my stuff is being kept in storage and my money is secure, I am the only one with access to it. When I am able to move out, I already have everything I need to furnish a one bedroom apartment. Even if I find a job today, it will still take at least 2 months before I can get reapproved for a mortgage and longer to find a place in my budget. For questions regarding my brother, he understands everything and is a fully functioning adult when he is on his medication. Due to this, he is able to give consent or refuse things unless it's deemed an emergency. We can't put him into a home or force him to do anything unless he is harmful to himself or others. I'm doing everything I can to move out but I'm in a position where I have to restart things before I can leave.", "NTA. You need to set some boundaries and draw a line in the sand.

See if there's any places in your area he can go to that specialize in mental health issues so he can get on a list for housing. A cousin of mine by marriage is schizophrenic and she lives in an apartment complex with others where their condition is monitored to make sure they're taking their meds, seeing their doctors, paying bills, etc. It's a halfway house style setting, but the residents live mostly independently. Prioritize yourself, and stop helping/enabling your parents.

I have a lock on my door and I never carry cash. All of my money is completely secure, no one has access to it but me. I told my parents already that I would not let anyone in my family move into my new place.", "I'm actually looking at a job right now, it's a receptionist job so I would be working in office. Not at home.", "I know, that's what I was thinking but I don't really know how I'm supposed to word it to my family. I've tried but nothing is ever done. I'm working on getting out but it's still going to take some time. I'm looking into getting a job where I will have a lot more free time to go to college and relax more.", "He's not deemed incapable. I've tried but he's considered capable and able to provide consent.", "That is extremely difficult to prove.", "Well maybe both for a little but mentally just try and focus on yourself and moving forward as much as possible. Any guilt you feel for looking to leave is holding you back. I think you\u2019re a really good person for giving up so much for others but you need to prioritize establishing a stable life for yourself. You can\u2019t help people when you need to help yourself.", "I told you to live the town. If you can be guilted to coming home to babysit your brother, they will do it. Move somewhere where you are not close", "Honestly?  This sounds like a scenario where it makes sense to get a junker van, park it overnight in a Walmart lot to sleep, and use a gym membership for showering.  Use a mail drop service as a street address.  Burner phone for telephone service.  Otherwise?  Something will always come up.", "I wish you luck and hope things get better for you sooner rather than later. I have zero advice to offer about your brother, but I absolutely empathize with you. My son and your brother have A LOT in common in both the problems at hand and how they choose to ignore the very real issue.", "Good.  I hope you get it!", "You don\u2019t tell them. You set everything up. You save the money \u201csorry I don\u2019t have anything extra. My bills were tight this month.\u201d You stock pile your money and then slowly move stuff out when they aren\u2019t looking/around. Then tell them you\u2019re moving out as you walk out the door. Point blank tell them that while you love them this isn\u2019t your responsibility and it\u2019s time to start living your life. You are being emotionally abused to meet THEIR needs. That\u2019s not why you have kids. It\u2019s wrong no matter their age. Don\u2019t give them your address. Get a PO Box if needed. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "Ok well then your only option is to get away as soon as possible.  It might be best if you don't inform your family and you let them know when you are gone.", "I imagine the frequent calls to the cops and for ambulances would have some kind of paper trail that would help going forward but OP has already said they have exhausted that avanue.", "Thank you, I am doing my best. I'm hoping to find something part time that I would be able to work and go to college. I'm thinking that if I can work somewhere with a decent wage part time I could move out before I start college in the new year.", "That's what I'm planning, I did that before and was gone for 6 years. I only came back due to my brothers passing. I can't just up and move because I would end up homeless. I have to find a good stable job first before I can do anything. I didn't know that they would push responsibility on me prior to moving in.", "I would but you can't really do that where I live. I would get in a lot of trouble with law enforcement. The homeless here have a big problem with finding places to stay. There's also a lot of crime.", "It can be a handful, thank you.", "I actually told them already that I am out of money. I still have some saved up for a down payment for a house. I'm just looking for a job right now so I can get the work history.", "It helps, but often it doesn't end until he does something criminal and ends up in jail", "Your parents are complete assholes for trapping you this way.", "Good luck!", "Had they been pushing responsibility onto your deceased brother?", "https://www.askamanager.org/category/job-searching", "I'm from a family with a pretty similar dynamic where it was always me being called to care to perform acts of service for everyone to the extent it was not only burning me out but actively impeding me from achieving my goals - lack of sleep and constant feeling of walking on eggshells if I \"displeased\" anyone made it very hard to study for uni and I failed a semester of my undergrad. When I got away, the financial uncertainty was scary but physically distancing myself was HELLA liberating. I did indeed end up living in my car for a bit, and in all honesty, I didn't mind it. There are a lotttt of regulations about illegal camping where I live, no sleeping in cars allowed with hefty fines etcetc and yeh security was a concern too as a solo woman in my 20z. But I made it work because I had to for my mental health. In my case, I moved to a place where every beach has a shower so I woke up at sunrise, went for an ocean swim and shower, and off to work. It's easy to rationalise away a solution like you've done here but tbh take a chance on yourself. \nPS, there are people out there willing to rent out a piece of land to park a van on, another option if you don't want to \"stealth camp\".\n\nEdit to add: my brother received injections for his schizophrenia for a number of years when he could not be relied upon to take his medication himself. Towards the end of the month sometimes it was a little strenuous but for the most part it worked very well and he was self reliant  He then successfully took his own meds for like 10 years and was living his own independent life in his own apartment. Perhaps injection medication could help?", "Maybe you have some friends or family, so you could park your car on their property?  \nYou have to understand, that you have to ESCAPE from your parents' house ASAP. Find the job first, move out - even to \"nowhere\" and from that point plan your future moves.   \nYou are a victim of abuse. You have to act like a victim of abuse, who wants to escape.", "Get in touch with a university , take out student loans, speak to them about living options. You can do all of this without anyone else now. You need to just do it. There are always \u201cmore ideal situations \u201c however they aren\u2019t realistic because of where you are now.", "Yay! Keep saving and working hard. You\u2019ve got this.", "Thank you!", "Yes, they pushed the same responsibilities onto him first. He had passed away in the house I'm in now. He was in the downstairs of our house. My other sibling had also been living downstairs in a separate room. Before I moved back in, I was going to go somewhere else but everyone was crying and upset. My other sibling had begged me to move back in so they wouldn't be alone downstairs. I told them from the start that it was temporary and that I would move in. I was told at the time I didn't need to pay for rent or anything and I could focus on college. I had also been injured in a car accident a couple weeks before my brother passed so part of it was for me to recover from my injuries. They waited for me to move in, leave my job, and start college before throwing all the responsibilities onto me. I passed one semester before I had to drop out due to my brother and because it was too much when I was already injured. They basically gave me all the responsibilities my brother that passed had plus some.", "Thank you, I actually found something earlier that I'm going to call and apply to", "That's the medication he's supposed to get. No one enforces it though. He'll be fine for like a month, maybe two but he stops as soon as he can. I worked with the homeless population here and everything so I know just what to expect if I take that route. Everything would be far more difficult if I were to try to live in my car or something. College students still have to pay a lot of money for a room here ($1200). I could not afford that. Renting land here is also just as expensive, I've already looked.", "I don't have family that I can depend on. Most of my friends are currently deployed so I'm pretty much doing everything solo. It's easy to say I'll just move out but it's a lot harder to do it. I have money saved up but I'm trying to do everything in a way that I won't have to worry about money or anything when I actually get there.", "I'm not talking about renting land outright, moreso subletting a place to park your van. Many people with large spaces do this, try asking about it in a community Facebook group, or volunteering with workaway. Also I find it interesting that you're intrinsically linking living in a van to the homeless population. Why? \n\nAll the best anyway, there are options to leave you just have to take them."]}
