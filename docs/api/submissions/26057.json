When he's on his medication, he functions normally. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed in his 20s and thinks nothing is wrong with him so he doesn't take his medication. I have another brother who passed away a few years ago, during that time my family asked me to move back home because they wanted me to be there. I was already moving due to COVID so I said I would because it would give me a chance to save for a house and finish college. After I moved in, my family pushed my brothers care solely onto me. I had to drop out of college because I was afraid my professor and other students would hear my brother having an episode (online classes due to covid), I've lost jobs because my brother would keep me up all night for days straight and I couldn't function properly or wake up in time for work. The only thing I'm able to do is call the cops/ambulance when it gets really bad so police/paramedics can admit him to a psychiatric hospital. In the 3 years I've lived here, I have called and handled him every time with no help from my family. My brother is an adult so if he refuses help they won't take him and I'm stuck having to deal with by myself. I've had times where I left my room to find my brother having a seizure on the floor and not breathing to him destroying things and threatening me. On top of this, my family constantly asks me for money and to buys stuff for the house. I've paid over $10,000 this year just helping with bills. It's gotten to the point where I am incredibly burnt out and want to leave. I love my brother and family but it's gotten to be too much and I can't progress or move forward. I've started to grow resentment towards my parents because they won't do anything. They're both trying to convince me to take over power of attorney because they're \"too old\". My mother has helped out with bills but hasn't done much to help my brother. My father hasn't done anything at all. Would I be the asshole if I told my parents it's their responsibility to take care of my brother and not mine?

I'd like to give some clarification, I have made multiple plans to get out but most of them have fallen through. I just lost my job due to one of my brothers episodes. Before losing it, I had been approved for a mortgage and was actively looking for houses so I could move out. I told my parents that I was not letting anyone move in with me. As much as I want to get out, I still need to find another job comparable or better than the wage I previously had. Both mortgage and an apartment requires you to have a job and be working for at least 2 months before you can get anything. This has set me back on finding a house/apartment. I previously worked in the medical field for 9 years. I have a lot of experience but the medical field where I live doesn't pay much so I've had to leave my field and move onto something else. I'm wanting to go back to college for software or computer engineering. I had previously been working on a medical degree but I have enough credits to let me complete a engineering degree in 1 year. All of my stuff is being kept in storage and my money is secure, I am the only one with access to it. When I am able to move out, I already have everything I need to furnish a one bedroom apartment. Even if I find a job today, it will still take at least 2 months before I can get reapproved for a mortgage and longer to find a place in my budget. For questions regarding my brother, he understands everything and is a fully functioning adult when he is on his medication. Due to this, he is able to give consent or refuse things unless it's deemed an emergency. We can't put him into a home or force him to do anything unless he is harmful to himself or others. I'm doing everything I can to move out but I'm in a position where I have to restart things before I can leave.", "NTA. You need to set some boundaries and draw a line in the sand.

Prioritize yourself, and stop helping/enabling your parents.

When I got away, the financial uncertainty was scary but physically distancing myself was HELLA liberating. I did indeed end up living in my car for a bit, and in all honesty, I didn't mind it. There are a lotttt of regulations about illegal camping where I live, no sleeping in cars allowed with hefty fines etcetc and yeh security was a concern too as a solo woman in my 20z. But I made it work because I had to for my mental health. In my case, I moved to a place where every beach has a shower so I woke up at sunrise, went for an ocean swim and shower, and off to work.

I was told at the time I didn't need to pay for rent or anything and I could focus on college. I had also been injured in a car accident a couple weeks before my brother passed so part of it was for me to recover from my injuries. They waited for me to move in, leave my job, and start college before throwing all the responsibilities onto me.

And it sucks, but if you can't handle the responsibility of his life AND yours, then you can't. You have done so so much for him and your family, even though they essentially trapped you there. And I want to be very clear - inviting you to come home for COVID and then having you move in with your brother, then not offering any support for you besides bills? That was them trapping you. \n\nIf your brother doesn't want to get help, if he thinks he is fine, then he shouldn't need your help either. It isn't a good situation, but you have to prioritize yourself. You have already lost so much trying to care for him. Everyone has a limit, and I fear you may have hit yours a while ago. \n\nIn the meantime, I would at least try and sit your family down and ask for more support if you haven't already. Or really, even if you have. If it is plausible, have a conversation with them and lay it out on the table. You are trying your best, and you need more help. On the same vein, if you think that you could get through to your brother about medication, being honest and trying to communicate with him that it would be a boundary YOU need in order to continue to live with him, I would recommend that. It is an extremely reasonable boundary to have - I also do not live with anyone who is unmedicated for their mental illness. It's for your safety as well as his, and if he doesn't take it he could DIE. Like, that is how the medication works. He IS NOT FINE, no matter what he believes. Support from your family in this regard could also be a game-changer, because denial is not going to save him.\n\nIf you can have that conversation safely, that is. If you can't, then you can't. Prioritize your safety. But sometimes a conversation showing others your point of view can really change your circumstances, and if there is a way that your brother could start being medicated again, it seems like that would fix a vast majority of the problems.\n\nso, most importantly, NTA.
