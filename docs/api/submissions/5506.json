Zack has a wife and two children (3f,6F). I was 13 when he had his first daughter so I couldn\u2019t really help but I tried. When his eldest daughter was 4 and his youngest was 1 offered to babysit but since then I think of them as little shits, yes even the 3 year old because she looks up to her sister. I could be sitting on the couch chilling and they both will come up to me and try take my phone or chuck toys at me. When I was 16 I got grounded because I broke one of their toys when they threw it to me. I could make a whole list on why I refuse to babysit because they cause too much hassle for me.\n\nFew days ago my parents were out of town for a while for some wedding so I had the house to myself, my brother came over to \u201ccheck on me\u201d but ended up asking if I would like to babysit that evening, I told him I was going out with my girlfriend. He told me \u201cjust take them with you\u201d. I told him I\u2019m not taking those children with me. He told me they are no trouble. He kept begging me saying he will pay me to cancel my plans and babysit. I told him his to shut the fuck up and I\u2019m not babysitting him anymore because his children are nightmares. He took it as an offence and told me that I\u2019m shit uncle and that I don\u2019t deserve anything. I put my finger up to him while he was leaving.\n\nHe called our parents and told them that I said his children are both little shits. I was thinking that but I wouldn\u2019t say it that bluntly. My parents agreed partly with me that they are a bit of nightmares but I should of just kept my mouth shut.", "created_utc": 1671836875, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztvdld/aita_for_telling_my_brother_his_children_are_both/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe you could be more subtle but i dealt with horrible children and he\u2019s your brother so i can understand being blunt.", "NTA if kids are shits it is uusally because of the parents.  It's probably high time your brother heard it from someone.", "NTA-Way to go!  You are right to call it like you see it and if they are nightmares, then so be it.", "NTA  You wouldn't have to tell him that his children are a nightmare if he would parent them.", "NTA Maybe he needed to hear why you are refusing to babysit.", "INFO: What do you do with the kids when babysitting? It sounds like you've been treating it as spare time with background noise rather than as a job to perform.", "You\u2019re not required to babysit but you sound rude as hell. You broke a child\u2019s toy because they annoyed you with it when they were 4 years old? YTA. I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019d want you to babysit.\n\nETA: also because you told him to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d during what sounded like a potentially annoying conversation but not one that warranted a response like that.", "ESH\n\nIf your brother really tried to force you to babysit at the last minute with a sprinkling of emotional manipulation he's a total AH.  \n\nThe toy thing was crazy shitty on your part but that was 2 years ago so really not relevant to this story. \n\nYou're an adult now.  Someone else being an AH is not an excuse to name-call children.  Next time just say no, stand up, grab your keys and leave.", "ESH - your brother for trying to get you to babysit when he knows you\u2019re not comfy with children, but you for your behaviour towards two small children & your attitude. \n\nIt\u2019s abusive AF to break a small child\u2019s toy just because they\u2019ve annoyed you. You complain your nieces are \u2018little shits\u2019, well\u2026 it\u2019s like the pot calling the kettle black.", "ESH, you don\u2019t like them I can understand, but I would avoid calling your nieces little shits all the time, I understand that they are acting vile right now, but kids change. I had a friend once do that to me (he\u2019d throw toys and have major tantrums) when he was very young, and now after 11 years of seeing him he is a COMPLETELY changed person (for the better). As time goes, ppl change. Trust that you may not see these nieces this way in a decade or so", "\"I\u2019m not babysitting him anymore because his children are nightmares. He took it as an offence\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally he took offense?  No..... YTA.", "I think you are too young to take care of them (which is not meant as an offense just a fact since it requires experience and calm ) and possibly they are also difficult to handle. Also, your brother just can't dump them like that on you. So overall, NTA, just try to avoid calling them nightmares, they are just kids and possibly can't help it yet to be demanding.", "ESH\n\nYou are a shit uncle, but your brother can't use you to look after his kids on a whim.", "YTA\n\nYou don\u2019t NEED to babysit, but you also don\u2019t NEED to be such a jerk-wad. They\u2019re kids, they throw crap, and also your not TA for BREAKING A FOUR YEAR OLDS TOY!", "Yta you sounds like the third Lil shit around but as it's troll Fest, i Guess you're just one more bored teen.", "YTA. You broke a toddler's toy because they threw it at you? You're acting just as much a \"little shit\" as them then. Not only that, but you mentioned they're \"throwing toys\" at you and \"Trying to grab your phone\". I'll take a wild guess and assume your idea of \"babysitting\" is---as you said, chilling on the couch on your phone whilst in the same room as the children. They probably behaved like this TO GET YOUR ATTENTION. Did you play with them at all? Engage them? Arrange for a game for them to play together? Or did you just sit there, on your phone, and get annoyed when they tried to get your attention?", "ESH. \n\nEven if you are right about the kids, and they do sound like a pain, telling someone their kids are nightmares is pretty shitty. \n\nI have some nieces and nephews who definitely aren't angels.  But I'm not going to tell my siblings that they are nightmares either, even if that is what I really think.  \n\nYou could've gotten your point across in better ways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just for future reference.\n\nEverything else your brother sucks for. His kids are disrespectful brats and yes nightmares. \n\nHe needs to reign them the fuck in and not drop them on someone when that someone has plans. \n\nEsh but not for your attitude about the kids. Just for being rude to your bro.", "Yeah, and he formed an opinion that a 4 year old and 1 year old were \u201clittle shits\u201d like, dude, that\u2019s a toddler and a baby. They were probably trying to get his attention. You can\u2019t just plop on the couch and play with your phone when babysitting kids that young. Gotta interact with them!", "INFO: What if the children are, in fact, nightmares?", "Wow! One time - 3 years ago - he breaks their toy on purpose. It was of course wrong, but is it really enough to change an NTA to an ESH for this situation?", "He\u2019s 19. He\u2019s not too young, just too immature.", "I disagree. Saying they're \"little shits\" is excessive, perhaps, but \"nightmares\" is perfectly illustrative. The parents need to find out ASAP. Maybe they will blow off the message, but sending it is an act of courtesy.", "He didn\u2019t really give an example of that though. He said the 4 year old tried to take his phone\u2026 he shouldn\u2019t have been on his phone when he was babysitting. Even still, he is also hating on a child that was 1 at the time! \n\nESH. The brother should never have tried to dump the kids last minute. But OP is a hothead who should never have offered to babysit 2 years ago if he wasn\u2019t actually willing to interact with the kids. And holding a grudge against toddlers is pathetic. He doesn\u2019t have to ever sit for them again, but his attitude is toxic and stupid.", "Yes, because his hatred has continued ever since. They were toddlers! What kind of lame adult holds a multi year grudge against toddlers for trying to take his phone and throwing a toy? Maybe if he\u2019d actually interacted with them, they would have behaved. \n\nHe\u2019s not obligated to babysit ever. But he sounds like a real AH anyway.", "Yes, ESH. Op said, \u201cI was on the phone chilling.\u201d that's not what I would want a babysitter to do. Engage with the kids and they won't be little shits. A toddler needs stimulation.", "He was never going to be NTA in this situation for me, because he *is* an AH.", "Exactly. I have no idea who the AHs are who are downvoting this very obvious point. He didn\u2019t have to babysit, but he **offered** and then proceeded to ignore them while playing on his phone. Anybody who has ever been around young children knows they need more attention than that. He shouldn\u2019t have offered. And he certainly shouldn\u2019t still be holding a grudge against perfectly normal and predictable behavior from a pair of toddlers when he was partially to blame! Breaking the toy in response is totally unacceptable too.", "Thiiiiis. Shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near children because he clearly lacks empathy, and that\u2019s worrying. At his age I had two younger siblings who were 6 & 3, and I never would have done anything like that. I absolutely adored my baby siblings. They\u2019re massive pains now at 17 and 14 though \ud83d\ude02"]}
