Any family members siding with her are trying to take advantage of you. You did her a massive favor by completing the work at cost. She insisted on proceeding with a damaged radiator and you advised her how to avoid further damage. She was then negligent and blew the engine. If you had said \"too bad, no driving\" when she insisted on reusing broken cooling system components she 100% would have bitched daily, requested you to cover her taxi/uber and blamed you if she was fired for being late. There is no winning with people like this. She is not reasonable.\n\nIf its practical you should tell her to fuck off and block her. It might not be due to family links but even so, **do not** let her walk all over you by paying for it. She can install a junkyard engine herself.", "I don't really understand it either but it's becoming a whole thing with the family, quite a few people are taking her side so while I'm pretty sure I've done nothing wrong I figured some unbiased internet opinions would help me double check that", "She's well aware that if a shop was going to do the repairs it would have been a write off, it's a 2001 beetle so it's not exactly worth a whole lot, and it's debatable whether or not it's worth trying to fix it now . As for how she hit the bollard it sounds like it was an accidentally put it in drive instead of reverse situation, which I still don't understand so I just put it down to her being a ginger doing ginger things", "For similar reasons, I don't fix my families computers (I only help with my wife's phone).\n\nNo one pays attention to the advice and seems to actively sabotage my help.\n\nI gave up driving 2 hours to unfuck my dad's computer. I just told him it was too complicated for me and for him to pay a local shop to fix it.\n\nNTA.", "Ha. May have to change my vote for the ginger comment. Seriously I can understand the stress at losing vehicle but she needs to blame the right person. It\u2019s learning experience everyone has.", "NTA. This is down to her. She should have rented a vehicle. She may even have been entitled to a discounted price as part of the insurance plan.", "NTA. this is why a lot of service people will not do any work for family. \n\nfamily tends to be entitled, and willfully negligent when it comes to stuff like this. \n\nHopefully she won't try to get lawyers involved. Best of luck!", "NTA. And stop helping her and anyone who agrees with her.", "ESH would you do that to an actual customer probably/hopefully not. She should have taken your advice to heart tho. If the family had helped with rides or a rental (ik this is a pricey option) then she would have done that in the first place.", "NTA", "NTA. She didn't maintain the vehicle that she had already crashed into a huge, inanimate object. I've had cars with radiator trouble and if you keep feeding them water and coolant twice a day, you can get weeks out of them before replacing the radiator. She decided not to do her part to stay on the road. No good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA.  So she couldn't be bothered to keep up maintenance and wrecked it worse.", "Im sure there  are a ton of people in your family that can help her, since they all seem to know a lot about damaged cars. /s\n\neasy NTA", "It's easy for other people to weigh in on situations they know nothing about, and don't have to fix. They are welcome to buy her a new engine, a new radiator, and some glasses, so she doesn't drive into anymore walls.", "Ooh. Okay, so you are an AH, it turns out.", "Eh, did you tell her what you meant by \"keep an eye on it\"? Because I, as someone who knows literally nothing about cars and radiators, wouldn't know what that means apart from like, does it start smoking?  \n  \nIn general I do think it's a bad idea to let someone who isn't knowledgeable enough to know what to look out for drive in a car with a known risk for blowing up.", "NTA and this is 100% why I don\u2019t work on extended families cars. They are the worst for - you changed my oil now my stereo doesn\u2019t work and it\u2019s your fault \u2026", "NTA! You did her a huge favor, and warned her about the radiator.", "Um, no, NTA. You were doing her a favour, you told her what to do with the temporary fix and she just decided she had a perfectly normal working car. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay for the idiocy of others.", "NTA.  Shit like this is why I no longer work on cars that aren't mine.  Do a brake change, and the muffler craps out.  My fault.  Do an oil change, and then the brake go bad.  My fault.  Screw that.", "Yeah, I\u2019d stop helping them. Ungrateful AF", "Hey now, ginger humans aren't like ginger cats"]}
