Any family members siding with her are trying to take advantage of you. You did her a massive favor by completing the work at cost. She insisted on proceeding with a damaged radiator and you advised her how to avoid further damage. She was then negligent and blew the engine. If you had said \"too bad, no driving\" when she insisted on reusing broken cooling system components she 100% would have bitched daily, requested you to cover her taxi/uber and blamed you if she was fired for being late. There is no winning with people like this. She is not reasonable.\n\nIf its practical you should tell her to fuck off and block her. It might not be due to family links but even so, **do not** let her walk all over you by paying for it. She can install a junkyard engine herself.", "I don't really understand it either but it's becoming a whole thing with the family, quite a few people are taking her side so while I'm pretty sure I've done nothing wrong I figured some unbiased internet opinions would help me double check that", "She's well aware that if a shop was going to do the repairs it would have been a write off, it's a 2001 beetle so it's not exactly worth a whole lot, and it's debatable whether or not it's worth trying to fix it now . As for how she hit the bollard it sounds like it was an accidentally put it in drive instead of reverse situation, which I still don't understand so I just put it down to her being a ginger doing ginger things", "For similar reasons, I don't fix my families computers (I only help with my wife's phone).\n\nNo one pays attention to the advice and seems to actively sabotage my help.\n\nI gave up driving 2 hours to unfuck my dad's computer. I just told him it was too complicated for me and for him to pay a local shop to fix it.\n\nNTA.", "Ha. May have to change my vote for the ginger comment. Seriously I can understand the stress at losing vehicle but she needs to blame the right person. It\u2019s learning experience everyone has.", "NTA. This is down to her. She should have rented a vehicle. She may even have been entitled to a discounted price as part of the insurance plan.", "NTA. this is why a lot of service people will not do any work for family. \n\nfamily tends to be entitled, and willfully negligent when it comes to stuff like this. \n\nHopefully she won't try to get lawyers involved. Best of luck!", "NTA. And stop helping her and anyone who agrees with her.", "would you do that to an actual customer probably/hopefully not. She should have taken your advice to heart tho. If the family had helped with rides or a rental (ik this is a pricey option) then she would have done that in the first place.\n\nEdit: NTA thank you OP for better drawing the picture even if all I needed was a couple more lines your family still sucks tho tbh", "NTA", "NTA. She didn't maintain the vehicle that she had already crashed into a huge, inanimate object. I've had cars with radiator trouble and if you keep feeding them water and coolant twice a day, you can get weeks out of them before replacing the radiator. She decided not to do her part to stay on the road. No good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA.  So she couldn't be bothered to keep up maintenance and wrecked it worse.", "Im sure there  are a ton of people in your family that can help her, since they all seem to know a lot about damaged cars. /s\n\neasy NTA", "It's easy for other people to weigh in on situations they know nothing about, and don't have to fix. They are welcome to buy her a new engine, a new radiator, and some glasses, so she doesn't drive into anymore walls.", "Ooh. Okay, so you are an AH, it turns out.", "Eh, did you tell her what you meant by \"keep an eye on it\"? Because I, as someone who knows literally nothing about cars and radiators, wouldn't know what that means apart from like, does it start smoking?  \n  \nIn general I do think it's a bad idea to let someone who isn't knowledgeable enough to know what to look out for drive in a car with a known risk for blowing up.", "NTA and this is 100% why I don\u2019t work on extended families cars. They are the worst for - you changed my oil now my stereo doesn\u2019t work and it\u2019s your fault \u2026", "NTA! You did her a huge favor, and warned her about the radiator.", "Um, no, NTA. You were doing her a favour, you told her what to do with the temporary fix and she just decided she had a perfectly normal working car. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay for the idiocy of others.", "NTA.  Shit like this is why I no longer work on cars that aren't mine.  Do a brake change, and the muffler craps out.  My fault.  Do an oil change, and then the brake go bad.  My fault.  Screw that.", "Yeah, I\u2019d stop helping them. Ungrateful AF", "Hey now, ginger humans aren't like ginger cats", "NTA. When I was 19 I covered my temperature gauge with a photo of me and my boyfriend. When I blew a gasket I learned about the importance of that gauge. My uncle lovingly fixed my issues but I did have to listen to several lectures about the importance of the various gauges on my dash. \n\n18 years later and I still regularly check and maintain my fluid levels, even though it's covered through the dealer as part of our purchase package.\n\nHopefully your cousin learns to not be entirely dependent on a mechanic and begins to understand the workings of a vehicle.", "NTA its entirely her fault. She crashed the car. She didn't listen to your advice about the radiator. Even if you didn't tell anything about the radiator every driver should know better and keep an eye on their temperature gauge to prevent blowing up the engine", "YTA.  You don't send someone out with a suspect radiator unless they are very familiar with cars.  For instance, I had a hose blow on my BMW and the engine was toast by the time I could slow to a stop on the side of the highway (which is to say less than 60 seconds.)  However, I don't think you're responsible for the cost of a new engine.", "YTA\n\nUnless she's a mechanic, \"Just keep an eye on it\" is way too vague. Did you explain what she was supposed to look for, how to look for it, and how frequently she needed to check?\n\nYou also shouldn't have offered to put the broken radiator back in, period. If it only lasted 3 days with minimal driving (to and from work + maybe the occasional trip to the store) then that thing was wrecked and as a professional you should have known that.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you did the work for free and were trying to help. You're supposed to be an expert, she trusted you, and you made a huge mistake by putting in a broken radiator and giving her bad advice. That's on you entirely.", "No good deed goes unpunished. NTA.", "This is why you don\u2019t do certain family members favours. It was your job and you tried to help family by saving money because you weren\u2019t charging labour. She thought she knew better and probably never even popped the hood once in the 3 days. Tell her to kick rocks and whoever has a problem with that can pay for her new engine/car. People don\u2019t think family members can take advantage of you but that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing. Obviously not all family is like that, you gotta use your own judgement.", "NTA", "NTA.  You told her what the risks were, and she agreed to keep an eye on things.  She didn't and it bit her in the ass.  You've learned a lesson here ***never fix a car for family.***", "NTA\n\nShe was warned.", "Info: can't you lose your ticket for letting a car that would fail a safety inspection on the road?", "Clearly NTA. Also, it's probably better for her to find a mechanic because she doesn't value your work. Let her actually pay for it a few times.", "When the little dial that indicates engine heat starts creeping toward red, add more coolant.", "She knows how to do the basics like check and top up fluids, so not only did she not look at it once but she also ignored the overheat warnings on the dash", "You are his cousin aren\u2019t you? Lol", "She knows how to do the basic fluid checks and top ups so I trusted her to keep an eye on it, and I wouldn't have used the old radiator if I thought it was on the edge of leaking. I pressure tested the cooling system and it held pressure for over an hour, and I also test drove it with no signs of leaking. I wouldn't have given the car back to her if I wasn't relatively confident it would hold, and even though it didn't the leak was small enough that it should have been easy enough to keep topping up in the meantime", "He also would have charged a regular customer labour for the work he did, just like you and I he works for money to support himself and family. If she wanted to be treated like a regulars customer she should have been paying labour but she wasn\u2019t so clearly she isn\u2019t a regular customer.", "Definitely done some quick temporary fixes for customers in a bind, obviously nothing that could ever be dangerous but living in New Zealand sometimes parts are months away", "A bent or leaking radiator wouldn't be considered a safety hazard, the rest of the car is straight and no suspension damage or anything like that", "A damaged but kinda functional radiator is perfectly legal to drive with in the US, so the answer to that heavily depends on where OP lives.", "Take note of who takes her side.  This is a quick and easy list of people for whom your services never need to be rendered.", "Could you not of swap cars for the time being? I mean as you would have known how to handle and baby it. while your cousin on the other hand obviously didn't. This would have prevent bad motors and family issues. It would have knowingly be sending someone out with a bad car parts.\n\n\nAs someone who has family work on car we do car swapping alot. As I have been in a similar situation as my father and brother worked on my car but when I got it back none of the electricals worked. Then I woke up to some who broke into my car and hot wired it lead to waking up with a bust radiator, stolen tires and ones loaded with nails, and a shitty transmission. I think my family bought a car for parts and gave me me the shirt end of the damn stick. I learn font let family work you your cars go to a shop.", "NTA. I laughed so hard at the ginger comment. My dad is a ginger and laughed really hard too. My kids are gingers and we say they are gingery too hahaha", "So she ignored the flashing red light and beeping that the car was doing to get her attention.

My mother got a new puter years ago, asked me to get her old data, so I put a folder on the desktop called \"Mom's Old Computer Files\" and she is still bitching that I need to get her files.

If neither of them knew what they were doing it'd be a hell no", "I mean that depends. Just cause they're doing a favour to the cousin doesn't mean they want to risk their own car. Was cousin at fault for crashing their own car ?  Also insurance might not cover if cousin is under 25 for example", "I drive a manual which she can't drive so that wasn't an option", "If she is paying she should not have gotten bad car parts."]}
