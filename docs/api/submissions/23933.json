Any family members siding with her are trying to take advantage of you. You did her a massive favor by completing the work at cost. She insisted on proceeding with a damaged radiator and you advised her how to avoid further damage. She was then negligent and blew the engine. If you had said \"too bad, no driving\" when she insisted on reusing broken cooling system components she 100% would have bitched daily, requested you to cover her taxi/uber and blamed you if she was fired for being late. There is no winning with people like this. She is not reasonable.\n\nIf its practical you should tell her to fuck off and block her. It might not be due to family links but even so, **do not** let her walk all over you by paying for it. She can install a junkyard engine herself.", "I don't really understand it either but it's becoming a whole thing with the family, quite a few people are taking her side so while I'm pretty sure I've done nothing wrong I figured some unbiased internet opinions would help me double check that", "She's well aware that if a shop was going to do the repairs it would have been a write off, it's a 2001 beetle so it's not exactly worth a whole lot, and it's debatable whether or not it's worth trying to fix it now . As for how she hit the bollard it sounds like it was an accidentally put it in drive instead of reverse situation, which I still don't understand so I just put it down to her being a ginger doing ginger things", "For similar reasons, I don't fix my families computers (I only help with my wife's phone).\n\nNo one pays attention to the advice and seems to actively sabotage my help.\n\nI gave up driving 2 hours to unfuck my dad's computer. I just told him it was too complicated for me and for him to pay a local shop to fix it.\n\nNTA.", "Ha. May have to change my vote for the ginger comment. Seriously I can understand the stress at losing vehicle but she needs to blame the right person. It\u2019s learning experience everyone has."]}
