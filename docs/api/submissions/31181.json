That\u2019s when my uncle called and told me that my ex-aunt had entered a drawing for a puppy and won it. She had no one to watch the completely untrained puppy and asked if I could do it. She said she would pay me but did not say how much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the kids are not disciplined at their mom\u2019s and are always out of control when I get them.

You are under no obligation to watch anyone\u2019s pet.  Your EA was totally presumptuous.  I feel sorry for her oldest child and the puppy.  \u201cWinning\u201d a puppy in a raffle rather than intentionally making an informed decision selecting a pet that you want, usually means that when the cute puppy turns into a dog, it is likely going to end up in a shelter or worse.  And if the oldest child continues to react negatively to the dog, then the odds of the puppy being around for long are worse.  Maybe by refusing to watch the dog, she will get tired of it quicker and it can be re-homed while it is still a puppy and before her oldest child is totally traumatized.", "NTA.
