He\u2019s 9-10 you say but I bet he\u2019s closer to 7. Or maybe his 9-10 it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nHe steals them and plays with them because this is grandma and grandpa\u2019s house. He doesn\u2019t know what part of the yard belongs to who.  \n\nNo he should not have taken your tights. But it is possible he did not think they were someone else\u2019s and he did not think he was stealing. The grandparents took them and we\u2019re going to wash them and give them back to you. Problem solved. I\u2019m sure that they talked to him about what to do and what not to take etc. I\u2019m sure the problem would not have recurred. You are absolutely an asshole for how you handled this and freaked out over a single incident. Not the asshole for washing your laundry or hanging tights to dry and you know this. Your passive aggressive title also tells me that you think you had every right to freak out over three pairs of tights.  \n\nThe level of your reaction was uncalled for and threatening to call CPS was IMO ridiculous.  You sound like a nightmare. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t like the grandparents were keeping the tights or burning them or making effigies to hold some kind of weird s\u00e9ance with or strangle the kid with them. I don\u2019t know what you even think calling CPS would do. Unless there\u2019s more to this story?\n\nYou owe them an apology for your over the top reaction. \n\nI am curious- when Stones were explaining did they say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d or \u201csorry about that\u201d while explaining - if so that makes you an even bigger AH, for glossing over that part and I would make them NTA and you YTA.\nEDIT to add that my comment was made before things were clarified and OP agreed with my judgment so before you negative the karma read the rest", "ESH\n\nEveryone at that door has behaved poorly.", "ESH. Grandpa was rude but it also sounds like a big overreaction. You leave tights outside in a communal space and expect they'll be free from pranks/theft/a number of other things? What about a drying rack? A fan?", "ESH \n\nI get that you would be disturbed by your missing tights and i don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong about hanging them up in your shared backyard. But everything unfolded wrongly on all fronts IMO \n\nYes the kid should not have touched, grabbed or done anything to your tights nor slammed the door in your faces. But we are talking about a child and we all know intrusive thoughts can be a powerful thing even for an adult. But if this is his first offense I wouldn\u2019t be too hard on him. However if this a pattern then I guess it makes this story a little different. My guess is he slammed the door because he had already gotten grilled by his grandparents and seeing you at the door, he realized his hell wasn\u2019t over. Or I could be working and he\u2019s just a brat. \n\nGrandma could have apologized which I don\u2019t think she did based on your story. They could also affirm that they have talked to the grandson about not grabbing other people\u2019s property and that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. \nBut I do actually think it was nice that she admitted to having your tights and why she had them, plus offered to re-wash them instead of just denying what actually happened. \n\nWhile I understand your anger and  confusion as to why this little kid took your tights,  you had a chance to de escalate or simply not escalate the situation. The yelling and threatening of calling social services was uncalled for in my opinion.", "Oh, and it's her fault for being upset the little monster did so and causing Grandma to get stressed out.", "It is not at all. The kid is being taught it\u2019s ok to steal women\u2019s clothes. That\u2019s not healthy at all.", "I am not sure why you are thinking I am lying on the boy's age-I used to be a babysitter and I am capable of distinguish a 10 yo boy from a 7 yo one since these are really different ages, I thought anyone could.\n\nNo, they did not apologized. They insisted their grandkid was \"curious about women's body\". If you can't see why this is really creepy you haven't hang out with a lot of boys that age, who usually don't steal clothes. Not only did they minimize the thing, they had like 5 hours to go ringing my bell and tell my bf, that was clearly home, \"our grandkid took some laundry to play\". They didn't. \n\nThe reason the title is that one is because reddit kept on telling me the post was too long and I had to shorten it so I shortened even the title, who originally was \"AITA for threatening my old neighbours because their kid stole my tights\"", ">He steals them and plays with them because this is grandma and grandpa\u2019s house. He doesn\u2019t know what part of the yard belongs to who. \n\nThis just seems permissive. I grew up in apartments. I understood what was \"our\" space from a young age...Because I was taught.

Who... who says \"well I pay for this space so I'd better not use it in case someone pranks me!\" People have dried clothing on lines outside for thousands of years. Why was the child playing unattended. Why was he not told what part of the yard was his. Why didn't they return the tights before OP had to go knocking. \n\nOp is NTA. The grandparents are. If grandma is in the hospital due to the stress of raising spoiled kids without rules, so be it. Thats a damn choice.", "I'm sure someone stealing your clean undergarments and leaving them in a state where they need to be cleaned before they were returned wouldn't feel gross or violating to you at all.\n\nNope, she should just accept that if she hangs her things to dry behind a blanket, someone might come along and use it for a cumsock. Totally rational reaction.", "I don't know where you are from but in my country it is extremely common to have drying racks outside in communal spaces.

That certainly wasn\u2019t clear and while it\u2019s not something I would even want my tights back from - I think threatening CPS was over the top.  Can you imagine - a young kid gets sexually curious and molests some tights and everyone in the building finds out about it and knows - I think that\u2019s punishment enough.  I\u2019m sticking with ESH.", "Also wasn\u2019t calling you a liar / figured you were unfamiliar with kids due to your strong reaction and threat to call CPS over a single incident", "I knew not to touch, let alone take things that weren't mine when I was much younger than this kid.", "Well that\u2019s a good point I didn\u2019t think of but it seems really young for that. I think that if it\u2019s someone elderly they probably didn\u2019t want to just clean them because the grandmother would know she\u2019s not going to want to wear them and they had already been washed so she was wanting to give them back in the state that they were taken. This is an old-school way of thinking. It doesn\u2019t make it wrong but it also doesn\u2019t make it right either. Regardless OP response was over the top. And I don\u2019t know that I can agree with you on giving them back immediately as the \u201ccorrect way \u201cbut it definitely should\u2019ve been offered as a choice. Maybe grandma thought she had enough time to get them clean and get back out there before OP got home. Who knows?", "The rational thought is leaving things in a communal space leaves them open to things happening. Period. I would be disgusted. But I would also know it was my fault too for leaving them.", "I understand BUT there is ALWAYS that chance. Any creep could have gone walking around. Sure this time it was directly related to a neighbor but the point still stands. I use a drying rack a lot but it's inside.", "Fine by me you final vote, I said what I said because I was really mad. And of course I hope someone ended up burning that tights,I would not want them again if they paid me good", "He is young but not so young to not have certain impulses, which is totally fine, just not with my clothes", "It's not fine if she thought she could clean them up and get them back downstairs before OP got home, but I could at least understand her thought process there. But refusing to give them back after admitting to having them is where she crossed the line, IMO.\n\nAnd Mr Stone directly triple jumped over the line when he blamed her for hanging her laundry to dry because \"boys are curious about women.\" How many times have women been told boys will be boys about other violations of their privacy and personal comfort? That's never okay to tell a woman.", "So you'd blame yourself if you walked down a random alley and got robbed because you should have known better?\n\nWay to victim blame.", "I can see your point and I guarantee you this story has taught me not to put anything outside but duvets, but in my defence the yard is totally closed, you have to get directly inside the building to access it. I guess the little creep gave me a lesson", "Yeah maybe they should just pay you for them. And they should have come to talk to you about it.  They were probably hoping nobody would ever find out.  Awkward to say the least.", "I agree with that for sure", "You did see where I said ESH- right? I feel like your acting like I said OP was the only issue", "Jfc I forgot personal responsibility doesn't exist anymore", "Lesson one... always assume there are creeps lol. But I keep an indoor drying rack and love it! Always a possibility!", "You're blaming the victim. The Stones basicallt told OP that the kid used them for sexual experimentation.

Don't point that stanky stick at me.\n\nMost discussions in the locker rooms I've been in, the most gross thing discussed is the state of some dude's gross ass socks that need to be washed. Or burned. Or both.\n\nOur team in high school, whenever we won a game, some dude would invariably start singing Baby Got Back. That's the most sexual thing I've heard in a locker room and it was more people being stupid than sexual.
