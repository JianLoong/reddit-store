My ex (44M) \u201cMax\u201d and I (44F) had our daughter \u201cAnnie\u201d (28F) when we were 16 and split up a year later. I married my late husband when Annie was 2, but she was difficult and they didn\u2019t have a good relationship. We were constantly in court fighting to keep her with us when she was younger. \n\nAnnie and I\u2019s relationship is rocky at best. I wasn\u2019t invited to her wedding in 2019 and I didn\u2019t know my first grandchild was born last year until my ex posted about being on \u2018grandpa duty\u2019 on social media. \n\nLast week Max posted a photo of himself on fb in front of a new house, which I knew he couldn\u2019t afford. Later he added another picture of him with Annie, her husband, and their daughter, thanking them for their gift. I saw red. Max doesn\u2019t need a house, he has no wife or children. Annie has four siblings who would have appreciated this gift far more than him. I know this was an intentional move to continue to drive home how much she loves that my ex is still focused solely on her. \n\nI called and yelled at her, and told her she needed to stop punishing me for moving on with my life and start being a decent sister. She should be willing to share any blessings she has with her entire family, not just one person. She said nothing, but after I hung up she blocked me. Max called me after and yelled at me for being \u2018cruel\u2019. He said that Annie and her husband can do whatever they like, and that Annie has no reason to take care of my children for me. I told him he poisoned my daughter against me and that she is who she is because of him. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, but my friends think I went too far and I need to apologize to Annie.\n\nEdit: For context, she knows we have been struggling financially since her stepfather\u2019s passing.

You got married again a year after splitting up from the father of your child. You then proceeded to have a rocky relationship that makes it seem like you had the court force her to spend time with you against your will. You are not at all a part of her life\n\nBut you see that she did something nice for her father, and your first thought is to phone her up to yell at her for not being more generous with your other children, who she presumably has no relationship with either\n\nI really hope this is either fake, or you\u2019ll take what I have to imagine is going to be a mountain of YTAs to heart to try and better yourself", "YTA. Your title makes as much sense as nothing else in the post.  The title makes it sound like you moved on after her father died or something. Instead we get treated to your diatribe of her buying something for her own father and you railing on her that she isn\u2019t spending money on, what I guess are you other kids/ her half siblings? Your incoherent rant didn\u2019t make that clear.\n\nWhat IS clear, is why you have a rocky relationship with her, and why you weren\u2019t invited to her wedding or even knew she gave birth.\n\nExcellent mothering skills you have.\n\nAnd,  no need for \u2018throwaway for privacy\u2019\u2026everyone you know knows you\u2019re an asshole.", "INFO:\n\nYou're leaving out the most important detail, why did you have to \"fight to keep her with\" you, why is your relationship \"rocky at best\"?\n\nYou are the AH for reacting like that to a gift, but I am sure you have to have been an AH in her childhood for you to get into this situation to begin with", "YTA. \u201cAnnie was 2 but she was difficult\u2026\u201d. 2 yo\u2019s are babies, how could she possibly have any responsibility for the outcome of the relationship with her stepdad? After living separate lives for all these years, how could you have any knowledge of what Max can afford or what he needs? How is her gifting her Dad any swipe at you? If this is any indication of your life with your daughter, it\u2019s kinda obv that you are the one with the poison. You seem to be harboring a lot of resentment towards Max and Annie is the scapegoat. If you want to have her in your life, you\u2019d better rethink how you are treating her, get some therapy and start making some changes before you lose both her and your grandchild. Good luck.", "YTA. Your daughter did something nice for her dad and your response was...  to call her and yell at her. I think I know why you have a bad relationship. \n\nYou don't get to choose who or what she spends her money on.", "YTA. You are leaving out a LOT of stuff for your daughter to dislike you to this extent. Missing missing reasons?", "YTA you\u2019re entitled selfish and completely delusional. \n\nIf you were involved in Annie\u2019s life you\u2019d have no right to demand how she spends her money or how she shares any success she\u2019s made\n\nBut you\u2019re not even involved in her life, yet you think that all her life\u2019s choices revolve solely around you and that you can decide how she should use her money.\n\nClearly Annie made the right choice cutting you out of her life", "Entitled YTA\n\nAlso, Annie and her step-father didn't have have a good relationship because \"she was difficult\"... while she was a 2-3 year old toddler? Or 4, 5, even 6yo child?

He assured me he wasn\u2019t and was just a tough disciplinarian. She was coddled a lot by her father and his family. I believed him and I never saw any abuse towards her. But Annie kept bringing it up and eventually the courts awarded her father custody, which broke my heart.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ve tried to talk with her about the \u2018abuse\u2019 but none of my other children have said anything like that about their father so I don\u2019t know why she would be any different.\n\n\"why\" would she be different?? She wasn't his child. And you didn't care enough about your first born to believe her. You denied her abuse, and now you want to profit off her hard earned money? That is pretty disgusting.\n\nYou earned her hatred by choosing your new bedmate over her wellbeing, you let your husband hurt her because having a bed partner was more important.. Even the courts saw how toxic and bad of a parent you were. You don't even care that she doesn't love you. You just want her stuff. \n\nYTA\n\nPlease leave her alone. \n\nPlus those \"other siblings\" are YOUR kids, that's their identity, not her siblings. Those kids were not abused by their bio-father, and you used that to deny what she told you.", "You sound like you\u2019re in a lot of pain but YTA.\n\n\u201c*married my late husband when Annie was 2, but she was difficult \u2026\u201d*\n\nMy heart just broke for toddler Annie.\n\nSometimes we do hard things to find peace.

The fact that you think she did this to drive something home to you is one of the most powerfully selfish things I\u2019ve ever read here.", "YTA and I can see why Annie prefers her dad over you", "YTA, willing to bet there is way more to this story than shared because even in this small story you sound awful.", "Contrary to your belief,  your daughter owes you nothing.  Period.  YTA", "Holy hell you cannot be serious. You really don\u2019t know that YTA here?  Lol. For real? Lol.", "YTA. It is their money therefore it\u2019s their choice on how they would like to spend it. Based on your response to Annie giving her dad a house I want to assume that you have negatively attempted to push a relationship between Annie and your new family. Plus does Annie even have a good relationship with her siblings cause if she doesn\u2019t I don\u2019t get why you think she should help them out", "YTA! What?! LOL\n\nI do have to admit,  I'm very curious about this relationship.  Annie 'was difficult' (at age 2?). You had to 'fight for her to remain with you' (Her dad wanted custody? When she had a voice in Court and wanted to live with her Dad,  you fought it?)\n\nShe has step/ half siblings? Why would you think she owes them anything? Or you? \n\nHer Dad doesn't deserve a house because... he's single? How do you know about his financial situation? How do you know he wouldn't be as 'grateful' as you? Has Dad always been there for her emotionally and financially? \n\nYou sound so bitter and angry.  It's sad you choose to live your life this way.", "You are hiding a great deal, for instance why your daughter was so difficult, why you had to go to court to keep her, the fact your relationship is rocky. Now it is all quite convenient to blame her dad, maybe she would have preferred to live with him rather you. then we get to her wedding, you were not invited, she chose to not inform you of her child. You think your ex \" Max\" poisoned her against you, l would think as primary carer, you were in a greater position to do so, maybe she saw your court battles as you keeping her away from her dad, then you mention she has 4 siblings, now do you mean half siblings? l assume these are the further children you had with your late husband, and it begins to make more sense. She felt an outcast from your new family, excluded in certain ways? maybe not deliberately,but l am sure she could put you right if she was speaking to you, it does explain why she was so difficult, she probably felt she never belonged. Then you, in outrage that she and her husband bought Max a house, in a jealous rage, basically demand that he was not worthy and her half siblings were more deserving? Am l right so far?  Well maybe it was gratitude for being there for her, maybe he had to live in a bedsit so he could pay child support, either way it was non of your business, now l have made a lot of suppositions because to be frank l had to read between the lines, what does not require reading between the lines is the fact YTA", "YTA. You need to accept things as they are. You are not entitled to all the same things your daughter gives her father.\n\nIf it bothers you so much, just cut ties, seeing as you already weren\u2019t invited to the wedding, and she didn\u2019t tell you she had a child.", "YTA. She doesn\u2019t have to buy you and you other 4 children a house. It\u2019s her money, she can treat her dad if she wants to do so. Maybe she bought him the house because she is his only child ( I\u2019m not sure she is, just assuming ) so if anything happens to her dad the house will go back to her and her family. Maybe it\u2019s an investment, and let\u2019s her dad live there. Regardless it\u2019s her money, her decision. You and her have a rocky relationship and hardly talk to the point you didn\u2019t know she had a child last year and wasn\u2019t present at her wedding, why would she buy you a house?!?", "YTA.  \nYour entire post sounds entitled. No wonder she doesn't do anything for you or her siblings, you make it out like she HAS to. She doesn't. Maybe YOU are the one who needs to grow up and move on, not her. You DO need to apologize. Your daughter is not your personal bank for you or other kids.", "YTA, you sound selfish and entitled as hell and it really seems like there's a lot you're leaving out in terms of what alienated you from your child. She doesn't owe you a thing. Also, you're loony for thinking that someone not buying you a house equates to \"punishment\" lmao.", "YTA. it sounds like you were the overbearing, jealous, and borderline if not fully abusive parent that your daughter went no contact with. there is no way she was so opposed to you moving on if it happened when she was 2. i get the feeling this is about your own behavior", "Narcissist, table for one! YTA", "YTA.  What Annie and her husband do with their money is none of your business.  Also, your relationship with Annie is also none of Max's business.  If this is how you have behaved in the past, this is why you have a poor relationship with your daughter.  You have probably sunk the last bit of that relationship with your tirade.  Even if you apologize, it may not make a difference.", "YTA, the very fact that you would even think of ordering your child to buy you house proves that you alienated your daughter against yourself. You can't apologize, she's well and truly done with you and good for her. Sucks to suck.", "YTA\n\nYou're conveniently leaving out a lot of information.\n\nShe's not punishing you. She's rewarding her dad because he probably deserved it for being an awesome dad. \nShe doesn't own her half sibling anything and you seriously need to get off your high horse and maybe get a therapist.", "YTA\n\nFirst off: your comment about your daughter telling you your late husband was abusive and you *not just not believing her but dismissing her*....\n\n>for moving on with my life\n\nIt's pretty clear you haven't moved on whatsoever. All they do is just to punish you? Yeah....no. \n\nI get a feeling why she cut contact. You sound like my father who I cut contact with as a teen, it's close to identical, even the part where you blame your ex for \"making her turn against you\". Since your daughter didn't even reply to you I bet she's on a similar path as I am: I know my father won't change, I'm used to his crap, that's why I don't talk to him, it's not worth it.", "YTA. Your daughter seems to be doing well, and your reaction is to resent her for not subsidizing YOUR children. You sound greedy and entitled.", "Too far? This was a journey you shouldn't have even started. Green is not your color. Do better. YTA.", "In what way could you possibly not be the asshole here, OP? I'm really confused about how you're viewing your terrible behaviour that allows you to justify it to yourself. Annie did nothing wrong. YTA, anyway.", "You are not entitled to her blessings", "YTA\n\nClearly your daughter wanted to be with her father and you didn't respect that. And now as an adult you are telling her how to spend her money. \n\nI suspect there is far more to this story than you are telling.", "YTA.\n\nI would love to hear the daughter's version of events. Bet it's a bit... different than yours, OP.", "YTA. Another mother who preferred a new man and children with him over a child from a previous marriage. From your description, it doesn't seem like you even love her so why the hell you think you have any right to demand anything from her?", "Yta your daughter can do whatever she wants with her money and you have no business calling and yelling at her like that. You may not want to admit it, but you are clearly part of the problem in your strained relationship with your daughter.", "Sorry, but YTA. Your daughter owes you nothing.", "YTA how is a 2 yr old difficult", "It's literally none of your business what your daughter does with her money. What are you \"seeing red\" for? It's totally ridiculous. You don't get to control what she does with her cash. And whether you are struggling or not is irrelevant, because she does not \"owe you\" money.\n\nIf your ex has a good relationship with your daughter and she bought him a house - good for him. He's a happy grandpa and you seem really bitter, mean and entitled.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou purposefully left out a LOT of extra content. \n\nYour husband hated your daughter and constantly abused her. But you were so desperate for this relationship, and for it to work that you turned a blind eye to it. \n\nI know for a fact that you knew it happened when you weren't around. So, to ease your \"guilt,\" you claimed that since you never saw it, it never happened, and she was lying.\n\nHowever, what you didn't count on was your daughter's real, more loving parent to fight for his child the way he did. And taking her away from your abusive household. The courts wouldn't have rewarded him full custody if it there was no proof. \n\nYou made your bed now lay in it. You couldn't break your own child down, and now you're mad that she's thriving and happy without you in her life. You should've been a mother to her when you had the chance.

Holy shit lady. It's clear to everyone that you don't care about her, just give up now yeah? Leave her alone.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  You don't get to dictate this and it sounds like Annie needs to just completely cut you off because this isn't working.   Deal with your entitlement and resentment on your own.   A good sister?
