Yesterday I worked from home and caught the people doing it.  It was a man and woman about my age.  Doing some digging after the fact they recently moved in a street over.  \n\nI go outside and yell at them to not leave their dogs shit in my yard.  I'm angry, i've been throwing their shit away for almost 2 weeks.  I tell them, I don't own a dog, never will, and shouldn't have to deal with the consequences of other dog owners being lazy.  They say its always gone when they circle back and would have picked it up if it was still there.  They thought I was cool with it because it was always gone.\n\nI tell them to never leave it in my yard again.  They clearly don't see it as a big deal and told me as such.  If it gets thrown away in the end, then whats the issue?  To me, its gross, its litter, it should never be my problem. I only threw it away because I think its ugly in my yard.  They just tell me to chill out, its no big deal and call me an asshole.  I just say you shouldn't be allowed to own a dog if you are going to be lazy.  They grab the poop and take it with them.

It just makes you look like an arsehole.", "Get a camera, catch them littering, and call the local non emergency police number to have them ticketed.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t have yelled at them. I\u2019d just drive to their house and thrown it on their front lawn. Or front door. Depends how good your throwing arm is.", "NTA , maybe you could have been more calm but it\u2019s never cool to throw garbage in someone\u2019s yard without express permission.", "NTA... but that's malicious compliance for the win; the rules usually state to clean it up; doesn't state you have to take it with you or throw it out \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23... Screw them... take screen shots of them not picking it up for ammo later and if they do it again then post em everywhere", "NTA. Sometimes my dog will take a dump at the start of a walk and I wind up walking around for an hour with a big bag of poop. Not very savory but it's part of being a dog owner.", "100% NTA\nI live in a very walkable community and near a elementary school that has been there for 95 years\u2026neighbors feel very entitled to use the school as a dog park (technically not allowed but they don\u2019t enforce).\nThe amount of baggies in my yard, empty garbage cans and around the school is amazing.\nI\u2019ve caught a few folks (all walks but skews to 70 year olds) and ask them nicely once.  \nI have a dog, unless she drops a poop I physically can\u2019t pick up (liquid), I\u2019m scooping.  \nFYI these two lazy folks had no intention of picking that poop up.", "Lol c'mon now. You knew you're NTA here, there's no sane way you ever could be. You just wanted to vent somewhere about some assholes leaving dog shit in your yard.", "NTA. dump them in their yard. I'm willing to donate baggies of cat-shit toward the endeavor.", "NTA-as a non dog owner, I had to buy bulk poop bags to pick up poop in my yard. We built a fence and now the poop is on the easement, but that leads to where cars are parked. I don\u2019t know why some dog owners think it\u2019s okay to not pick up or leave their bag of poop instead of just taking it with them. I do that when I foster, it\u2019s the right thing to do. Next time, just collect all the bags in a box, let it sit in the sun, then put it in their yard.", "NTA. I would gather a good months worth in a box and then deposited it all over their lawn. But I am petty when it comes to shit like this.", "NTA and sounds like it\u2019s time for a motion activated pop up sprinkler. They worked wonders when I had a stray cat issue. They were pissing in my porch upsetting my indoor cats. After a few times of that sprinkler going off they found somewhere else to piss.", "NTA Ain't no way they were ever going to pick up that poop at the end of the lap.", "NTA. If they ever leave it in the future, feel free to leave it on their porch.", "I\u2019d have saved it up for a week and then dumped it all at their house. I\u2019d dress up in a dog costume and push it all through a hole in the bottom onto their doorstep \n\nNTA", "NTA. next time they leave poop bags on your property take it to their front door and splat the bag as hard as you can against the door. with any luck they will have a poop door and you will have vented at least a little frustration.", "NTA, an older friend of mine had a similar issue but it was not bagged.  She watched a man walk a very large mutt (massive poops) every morning and would not pick it up.  She waited several mornings for his dog to go in her yard (it did in several other yards). She storms out in her nightgown Picks it up with a baggie and tosses the bag at the guy.  Curses him out and tells him if she ever sees the dog pooping on her block again it will be flying at his head and it will not be in a bag.  They guy never walked down her block again.", "NTA. The next time they do this take the poo bag back to their house and throw it full force at the front door. Or leave it in their mailbox to ferment.", "NTA - we\u2019ve bought little dog bag poop holders and bag carriers for each leash for our dogs. It\u2019s people like these who get dogs banned from parks like they are from the park behind our neighborhood (goes back years before we moved here)", "NTA and tbh, I\u2019d be following them on their walk from a distance to see where they live, and then start leaving bagged human shit on their lane.", "NTA.  Save their bags of dig shit and go deposit it in their yard.", "NTA. It isn't your dog. You don't have a dog. That's not their yard. They should be taking it with them.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s gross and rude when people don\u2019t pick up after pets but picking it up in and bag and dumping the bag there is just baffling. It\u2019s really not hard to carry it till you get home if you\u2019re walking around the streets.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to return the shit to their yard. Yeet the dog shit back into their property", "NTA.  If you have a dog and it poops on your walk you take it with you.  It's the right thing to do.  \n\nThat being said maybe calm down a bit.  You never know how things are going to get out of hand.", "NTA \n\nThis coming from a dog owner that has carried a bag of dog poop 2 miles to throw it away in my own trash.\n\nThey\u2019re beyond lazy! Set up a camera.", " I have had many rescue dogs, over the years. Not once, have I left their poops or bags on other people's property. But, sounds like some shtbgs moved into your neighborhood. Super lazy, entitled ones, at that.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Wth???", "NTA.\n\nFrankly im of the opinion a dog shouldnt be shitting in your yard in the first place. If any people or their belongings (including pets) go on my propetty without my permission, thats trespassing. Accidents are fine obviously, but walking a dog is hardly an accident, youre doing it for that reason.", "NTA. On my various dog walk routes, I habitually pick up bags, and even raw shit, left by others. I HATE THIS. Why do I do it? Because, for now, it's my neighborhood, and I want it to be decent.\n\nI refuse to hear any whines about \"oh, I'll pick it upon the way back.\". EFF THAT. Also, YOU'RE LYING.", "Dog owners shouldn't let their dogs poop or pee in private yards. They kill the grass. They should only go in public areas or their own yard. Pull the leash, dog owners.", "I would collect all the bags they leave and then dump it all on their lawn at the end of the week.", "Yep\u2026 that\u2019s a big no no in my neighborhood. Your dog, your poop, place in YOUR trash bin. Don\u2019t put dog shit in anyone\u2019s bin but your own or a community dumpster.", "Oh, that's a bad idea. I asked about that a month ago on NoStupidQuestions. I've never owned a dog and I personally don't care. I'm 100% fine with people using my trash can to toss anything. No one has abused it by overfilling it or sticking in dead babies, so please none of the Reddit \"what-ifs\".  \n\nThe amount of people who HATE dog poop bags in their trash chimed in.", "Oh they aren\u2019t coming back later, they are relying on the Dog Poop Fairy to clean up after them", "It's worse than leaving the poop just sitting there unbagged. It's the poop equivalent of those people who leave a fake note on a parked car after hitting it. That's a special kind of evil. It's wrapped up like a little poop present deep from their poop-filled hearts.", "And they have the nerve to say it's no big deal. it's a big fucking deal to the PO. He should have told them it's no big deal for them to stick it in their pocket while they are finishing the dog walk.", "I would start flinging that bag at them everytime they leave it on the lawn. If they can\u2019t bother to carry the bag with them on their walk, I\u2019m not going to carry it to their house either", "Never have left it in anyone\u2019s yard or property, but at a preserve where we are wandering we sometimes set it down until we are ready to leave because not going to run a mile to toss it in the car. We always take it though. And pick up after other dogs if we see anything around where our dogs go. However I just saw online at a pet retailer site that they have a little contraption you attach to leash and it will hold full bags, so thinking we might get that. Funny invention, but so useful!", "If you leave your dogs shit in someone else\u2019s yard because don\u2019t want to carry your dogs poop until you reach a trash can, don\u2019t have a dog. Don\u2019t get how this is not common sense for people. \n\nNTA OP. You\u2019re a lot nice than me. I\u2019d toss it in their yard.", "It\u2019s not okay to use someone else\u2019s trash can because some people don\u2019t have pets and also keep their bin in a garage, and the shit bags tend to just adhere to the bottom of a bin. No one expects a trash can to smell good, but no one wants to smell shit, especially if it\u2019s not of your own doing.", "I know this sounds crazy and might be hard to wrap your head around but hear me out. If you are on a 30 min walk and your dog poops a minute in, turn your ass around and throw it away and continue your walk!!", "Most of the dog owners in my large subdivision do this exact same thing. No one considers it rude because most people here have pets and who wants to carry a bag of shit around with you when you will be walking back that way in 20 minutes or less. It doesn't get left in people's yards though but rather beside the road.", "How lazy are you people? Double bag it and carry it. So incredibly selfish.", "Such a pain to carry a half pound bag of poop. Seriously just double bag it and throw it in a pocket if you\u2019re too lazy to carry it.", "For those who have not experienced it first hand, those poop bags like to burst when other things are dropped on them, like full trashbags. And now the bins have to be cleaned. If your shit is noticed ahead of time it has to be removed and put in something less likely to result in shit bombs. Thus for SOME REASON bin owners get their panties in a twist over all this gross extra work someone tossed in teir bin.", "He's got a bin behind his house. It's in his post.", "I walked a neighbors dog and would leave it at my own mailbox while I took the dog for his walk. It was convenient that he pooped within the three houses between my neighbor's house and my house. I picked it up on the way back to dispose of in my neighbor's garbage can. I wouldn't leave it at a stranger's mailbox though!", "Oh, that's so cool. Doggie brings home a gift for the owner!", "No no, poke holes in the bag small enough to keep the poop in, but big enough they will burst open on impact, then throw them at their windows.", "Finally a job I'm qualified for \ud83d\udca9\ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No one likes to walk with the bag of poop, but you get used to it, I did. I don\u2019t know if half of my neighbors would recognize me without my lovely accessory.", "I saw that and I assume that 90% of Redditors won't. Take a look at the comments. Reading comprehension isn't good in the US of A.", "This is just gross and irresponsible. It should not be a \u2018thing\u2019.", "This! I walk my dog every. single. day. (Duh!) and when I pick up her poop, once I tie the bag, I can\u2019t smell it anymore. Amazing!", "Did the dogs poop too?", "I would assume so, but they just left them wherever they dropped"]}
