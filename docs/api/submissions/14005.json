It is set in my yard and i've been throwing it away in the community dumpster in the alley behind my house.  No idea who was doing it until yesterday.  Yesterday I worked from home and caught the people doing it.  It was a man and woman about my age.  Doing some digging after the fact they recently moved in a street over.  \n\nI go outside and yell at them to not leave their dogs shit in my yard.  I'm angry, i've been throwing their shit away for almost 2 weeks.  I tell them, I don't own a dog, never will, and shouldn't have to deal with the consequences of other dog owners being lazy.  They say its always gone when they circle back and would have picked it up if it was still there.  They thought I was cool with it because it was always gone.\n\nI tell them to never leave it in my yard again.  They clearly don't see it as a big deal and told me as such.  If it gets thrown away in the end, then whats the issue?  To me, its gross, its litter, it should never be my problem. I only threw it away because I think its ugly in my yard.  They just tell me to chill out, its no big deal and call me an asshole.  I just say you shouldn't be allowed to own a dog if you are going to be lazy.  They grab the poop and take it with them.

They should pick it up, go 30 seconds to the dumpster by your house, and bin it.", "NTA- I am BAFFLED by all the people saying leaving the bags of poop to come back to later is normal???? I have literally never left a bag of poop where my dog did their business. You just carry it with you! So gross to just leave it!", "NTA. It\u2019s always gone because you picked it up! Entitled dog owners are the worst.", "Oh no, NTA. They are being so disrespectful leaving it there. Some of my neighbors have little signs on their lawn..maybe that's worth a shot. Last neighborhood we lived in, so many people let their dog go in our front yard...so frustrating. Don't get a pet if you're not willing to take care of it.", "NTA. They are just gross and lazy.", "NTA.  C'mon, now, did they really believe that anyone would be \"cool\" to find a bag of dog feces in their yard?   The dog owners in this case are TA!", "nta\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust drop the bag off in their yard everyday", "NTA those types are awful.  I hate when they do it on nature trails too. Like take it to your or a public trash can", "NTA. It\u2019s *not* normal to leave a bag of poop in someone\u2019s yard.", "NTA. If you know their house, start delivering it back to them.", "NTA. And frankly they need to either double bag or invest in scented bags because wtf is this shit of coming back for it? Yeah no take the shit with you.", "NTA\n\nWow, what is wrong with people? Like anyone else wants your dog's poop in their can or in their yard. Take it with you back to your house or put it in a public trash can. This gives all dog owners a bad name.", "NTA. Dog owner here. I would never consider to leave a bag of dog poop anywhere. The whole purpose of the bag is to take it with you so you can properly dispose of it along your way. There are even bags that look like little plastic shopping bags that you can tie shut and are easy to hold on to.", "NTA, I would've done the same thing tbh", "Nta\n\nResponsible dog owners pick up after their dogs.", "NTA. I would have thrown the poo at them next time.", "NTA.  I love dogs and often have to clean up while walking them. Part of the cleanup process is finding a trash can to leave the deposits.", "NTA.

Then throw it on the roof of their house.  Tell them it is no big deal.", "NTA.\n\nIf you know exactly where they live, make a point to pickup their dog's poop and take it over to leave in their yard. They should get the idea quickly.", "NTA.  They are just lazy.  I'm a single person who owns three dogs and still manage to bag their poop on walks and carry it with me until I reach a bin.  It's not difficult or hard.   Some people are just entitled jerks.", "NTA.  It is their litter, their responsibility.", "NTA  How were you supposed to know they planned to come back for it?", "NTA. A big part of being a responsible dog owner is carrying the poop until you can dispose of it. I\u2019d throw it on their doorstep if it happens again.", "NTA. They are entitled. Tell them you will call the cops next time may make them rethink it.", "I'd dump the bags on their porch and say it's only dog poop, chill out. As long as you throw it away who cares.", "Not sure where you live but in urban areas this isn\u2019t entirely uncommon. It is not a sign of being lazy, it\u2019s usually a sign that they don\u2019t want to carry poop around the block with them. \n\nQuestion: Are they leaving the poop bag in your actual front yard, or in the parking strip (the small area of land between the street and the sidewalk in front of your house)?", "YTA.\n\nIf I'm going on a 30 minute walk with my dog and she poops a minute in, I'm going to clean it up, bag it, set it on the ground (usually at the curb) for 28 minutes and then pick it up before I get back to my house. This is normal. It means you don't have to carry a bag full of dog poop with you on a walk. Dog poop smells.\n\nIt sounds like they are being responsible and that these bags weren't going to be there more than an hour, or however long their walks are. That's not being lazy. They're cleaning it up! Why are you rushing outside to grab some other dog's poo bags within minutes of it being set there? Calm down dude.\n\nETA: this judgment absolutely changes if they forget about a bag and it's there for hours/days. That's totally different and not acceptable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Duh.", "You don't leave it in people's yards, its not your place either to draw the line for how long its fine to stay there for either. \n\nNot to mention that SHE doesn't know how long its been there for either.\n\nHell even the side curb is a dick move too because people can park there. You can AT LEAST carry it to the corner.", "If they don't want to carry bags of dog poop, they shouldn't have gotten a dog. It comes with the territory.

Just carry the damn poop bag around with you.", "Firstly, I don\u2019t care how long your dog is being walked for and at what point your dog had a shit. That dog belongs to you and so does that shit. I don\u2019t want it on or in my garden for any amount of time and your dog walking length shouldn\u2019t make a difference. I have no way of knowing if the shit now lives there, or if it\u2019s renting space for 28 minutes.. shouldn\u2019t have to ask, it\u2019s my property. Maybe I have cleaned it because I saw it and wanted my property to look nice just because, or I have guests. I have potential buyers or renters, my wife is coming back from childbirth, my mother had hip surgery and could slip on random shit, my nieces are visiting.. \nWhstever. I want my property to be shit free for whatever weird reason that human beings want to be shit free. \nSecondly. Don\u2019t leave actual shit on someone else\u2019s property. You leave it on the curb, alright. Don\u2019t tell someone they can\u2019t be upset at actual shit on their actual property", "Your completely wrong this is gross and not at all responsible or normal.

The only time 'she' has been used on this thread is when I referred to the dog I own, and she is female.\n\nI agree that the poo bag should have been moved off of the yard. I suppose the corner is better if parking on the street is common.", "I've worked as a dog walker and also own dogs.  There are plenty of poop bags on the market that are quite effective at masking the scent so it's not an excuse not to carry the bag with them.  They are just lazy jerks.", "Sorry alot of posts lately have had the OP identify as female, so just habit at this point lol."]}
