Yesterday I worked from home and caught the people doing it.  It was a man and woman about my age.  Doing some digging after the fact they recently moved in a street over.  \n\nI go outside and yell at them to not leave their dogs shit in my yard.  I'm angry, i've been throwing their shit away for almost 2 weeks.  I tell them, I don't own a dog, never will, and shouldn't have to deal with the consequences of other dog owners being lazy.  They say its always gone when they circle back and would have picked it up if it was still there.  They thought I was cool with it because it was always gone.\n\nI tell them to never leave it in my yard again.  They clearly don't see it as a big deal and told me as such.  If it gets thrown away in the end, then whats the issue?  To me, its gross, its litter, it should never be my problem. I only threw it away because I think its ugly in my yard.  They just tell me to chill out, its no big deal and call me an asshole.  I just say you shouldn't be allowed to own a dog if you are going to be lazy.  They grab the poop and take it with them.

Hubby swings back around, runs over the runs, which splattered out under the mower deck and on Hubby's shoes, legs, and cargo shorts. I have never seen him so angry (rightfully so).
