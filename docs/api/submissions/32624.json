My two friends had already signed a lease on an apartment before they learned I was looking for a place, they had an extra room so they asked their parents (who are on the lease and pay my friends\u2019 portions of the rent because they do not work) if I could come live with them. My one friend\u2019s dad was the one who took charge of the leasing process so he pretty much made the call with little input from the other parents. He was aware that you are technically not supposed to sublease here but was okay with it because it\u2019s a large apartment complex and the management wouldn\u2019t know that I was living here off-lease. He also knew that I was bringing a dog with me that would also not be on the lease. I pay 1/3 of the rent and utils with money that I earn at my job and have paid every month up until the current month.\n\nThe situation:\n\nFast forward 4 months later, we are one week away from the end of the semester. My friend\u2019s dad and his wife came to stay here for thanksgiving, and apparently his wife (who is a very \u201cnit picky\u201d woman) did not know I had a dog until then. \n\nSo yesterday, I wake up in the morning and hear my friend on the phone with his dad who is yelling about me needing to go, saying that I\u2019m freeloading and taking advantage and that me and my dog need to go. Towards the end of the call he says he\u2019s going to ask me for this month\u2019s rent and \u201cgo from there.\u201d Later that day he sends me his usual monthly text with a breakdown of what I need to pay for the month acting like nothing is wrong, even saying \u201cthank you in advance.\u201d This guy is going to try to collect this months rent from me then tell me I need to leave after he gets my money. Obviously I went and found a one bedroom and applied for it that day, it\u2019s an additional $300 a month to what I\u2019m paying right now and I will have to make a security deposit of $800 plus first month\u2019s rent ($800) when I sign the lease. I am also having to move during Christmas break, which is necessary because I won\u2019t have time to do it during next semester with my job (35 hours a week) and full time school. I am lucky that I heard that phone call because if I didn\u2019t learn that I needed to leave until he decided to tell me, which he hasn\u2019t yet, I don\u2019t know if I would have time to leave before next semester starts. Anyways given these circumstances and the fact that he has no legal recourse to collect this month\u2019s rent from me because there\u2019s no formal agreement, I have decided that I am going to move out and just not pay him. If he tries to press me for the rent before I\u2019m able to move out I\u2019m going to say I won\u2019t have it until my next paycheck on the 16th (happens to also be the day I plan to move out.) AITA?\n\nLet me know in the comments if you think I need to give more context/any other info.\n\nEDIT: I confirmed with my friend after hearing the phone call that his dad does indeed want me gone. He said he doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019s going to tell me tho. I have not told my friend I don\u2019t plan on paying his dad.", "created_utc": 1702067713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dw0ee/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_another_month_of_rent_on/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your situation is complicated by the fact that you aren't on the lease as a tenant with the property owner, but that doesn't mean you don't have rights in this situation and if anything this situation presents far more problems for your friend and his dad than for you. I am NAL but I have a lot of experience with shitty landlords and have helped others with similar problems.\n\nYou are a tenant in this situation and your landlord is your friend's dad. You have rights as a tenant and they cannot evict you without cause. What they could do because you are month to month is give you notice to vacate, which would typically be 30+ days, after which they could try to evict you if you failed to vacate. Doing so would pose huge problems for them because eviction is a legal process and if the actual landlord caught wind of it they could potentially evict your friend for violating the terms of the lease. \n\nThat said leaving and not paying for the next month instead is a totally valid way to approach this situation given that you haven't signed any kind of agreement to give notice before terminating your tenancy. In the future, many schools have services that help their students with landlord issues.", "INFO: Why don't you confirm what you overheard first?", "I need some clarification.  You live with 2 friends whose parents pay their rent.  Parent #1 said you and your dog could move in.  \nWas it Parent #2 whose wife got her undies in a bundle and said you had to move out? Or was it Parent #1, who okay'd your moving in? \nIt really doesn't make too much difference as I think you should pay for time you will be in the apartment (2 weeks until the 16th) and good on ya for moving out, so NTA.\nBTW, how do your friends feel about all this?", "Nta", "NTA, I would only pay for my time there, but not the whole month.", "NTA at all! The great thing about this is when you pay rent on the 1st of the month, it\u2019s for THAT following month. All other bills are billed after the service has been rendered. \n\nSkeedadle ASAP and tell that prick to sit on a cactus. Whether you want to square up on your utility usage is up to you, but I\u2019d feel really disrespected in your situation and would tell him to go fuck himself on the utilities.", "if you mean rent for December, you should pay half because you are living there half of the month and paying was your agreement.

If you enjoy their company and like their presence in your life, I'd offer to pay rent later or a similar agreement to show good faith. If you leave without paying, you leave the friendship.", "ESH.

You are **assuming** he's going to take your money, then kick you out.\n\nDepending on the laws in your area, you may still have legal recourse IF the situation is as you assume.

However, if you've been living there and paying rent, you and your landlord have been acting as if you had a contract, and that's what a small claims judge will look at. This guy is screwing a college student, which isn't cool.\n\nIn your position I might be willing to run the risk that the dad isn't going to go to the trouble of filing a small claims suit, then pursuing collection of the judgment. Yes, you owe the money for December rent, and yes, it's shitty not to pay him, but basic survival and making sure you have a roof over your head takes precedence. If he chases after you and serves you with a small claims suit, you can always capitulate and offer to pay him $50-$100 a month until the debt is settled, in which case you're winning at the cash-flow game, and sucks to be him.\n\nMy judgment is ESH because you do owe the rent and your friend's dad is going to have to chase you if he wants to get it, but it's also very, very shitty to screw with a student's housing situation for no fuckin' reason. And frankly, if the only reason he's kicking you out is because his wife doesn't like your dog, then he is another satisfied customer.", "Sound like OP was paying money to the dad, so I don't see how the friend would pocket it...", "Thank you for the correction.", "NTA then.", "Yea,  I probably wouldn't either realistically.  It's horrible that they are taking his money, knowing they are throwing him out.", "Yeah, but then you loose the moral, and potentially legal high ground, by not following a verbal contract. If that doesn't matter to you then go ahead, but it might matter to OP.", "Op never bothered to just ask when they want him out and that's an assumption he made.", "This really seems like something you actually need to address head on before taking leaps. Yes, it\u2019s clear that the dad wants you gone. It\u2019s not clear your friend is going to enforce that, or whether it would happen before the end of the month/term. ASK. Say you overheard and need them to be honest about whether you need to find a new place before next month if you pay.", "He said he\u2019s planing on moving out the 16th. I can\u2019t believe the number of downvotes we\u2019ve both gotten. People clearly don\u2019t understand eviction. You still have to pay for the time you live there.", "Hmm didn\u2019t know that. Thanks for the advice I\u2019m going to look into it", "Legally,  op is in good shape.   With an illegal sublet,  you can't take him to court without exposing yourself to a suit.  Verbal agreements are tough to enforce.   Tougher when the agreement violates another contract. \n\nMorally,  I also think OP has the high ground.  The sublettor is trying to breach the agreement.   Op is simply acting first.", "OP is already saying they won\u2019t pay for the month so I doubt it matters. The dad is actively breaking his lease agreement by subletting the place so he doesn\u2019t really have a leg to stand on either", "Well like I said my friend has no say in it. If his dad wants me gone I have to go.", "Just the way this sub is sometimes. Especially with rent or landlords.", "To further expand on that. Your friend's dad can't evict you at all. He isn't the landlord. Only a landlord can evict you. If you have stayed there for more than 30 days you have tenant rights. To evict you now would require the landlord to serve you a notice of eviction, which would typically give you 30 days to leave. If you decide to contest the eviction, you often can stay in the rental until your court case is decided, which could be a few months. \n\nIf he wants to evict you now he would have to tell the apartment complex management company that he has violated his lease by allowing a sublease. They would have to evict EVERYONE on the lease, not just you. They also would likely come after all of you for money for the dog. So yeah, I would move because that guy is going to make your life difficult. But your name isn't on a lease and you've lived there long enough to have tenant rights. If you *want* to stay, his kid is going to have more legal trouble than you will from the eviction process. Arguably since you have no written agreement but have lived there for an extended time, you could just stop paying rent now and let him try to evict you. It will take at least 120 days before you have to leave that apartment.", "You don't need to. This person has it backwards. In most situations, in the U.S., *they* can't kick you out with no notice, but *you* can certainly leave with no notice.", "It's the middle of December and you're not going to pay December's rent?  Really?", "Ignore them and just leave. You don't have to have long conversations with anyone; you know you are being kicked out, and it's better to leave on your own than wait, and talk, and talk, and talk, and then get kicked out. The nice thing about living on your own and having control over your own life is that some butthead dad can't kick you out without warning.", "I dont know where OP is and they absolutely should confirm what their rights are. It\u2019d be reckless not to.", "Also, it's an unauthorized subtenancy.  The Dad is going to have to jump through major legal hoops to enforce that contract in most US jurisdictions.  The complex probably doesn't give a damn because OP is moving out.\n\nThe Dad might be able to take OP to small claims court, and you just never know what a judge/commissioner is going to do in small claims court.  But, no matter what the Dad does it will be a whole lot of headache for $500.", "This is not correct. In most places in the US, notice is required by whoever is ending the lease. Usually 30 days, though *this* will vary by location. You may leave earlier, but you are generally required to pay out the notice period.", "They mentioned that the two roommates are in a lease agreement with a management company that does not allow subleases. \n\nIf they try to argue that there is somehow a lease agreement with OP then they would be admitting to breaking the terms of their own lease. \n\nWhich would not be a smart decision.", "Sure, except OP's not on a lease, so none of that applies to her.", "Oh, god, if OP is in the US, that's very incorrect. OP pays rent. They are a month-to-month tenant, with the rights of a tenant. A written lease is not necessary.", "The dad in this case is actively breaking his lease agreement by allowing the sublet. Wouldn\u2019t be smart for the dad to push on OP as OP can and should inform the management company if that happens.", "Honey, yes, OP has the **rights** of a tenant regardless of whether she's on a formal lease or not. That's why, as I mentioned, they wouldn't be able to kick her out with no notice. But she doesn't have the **legal responsibilities** of a tenant, like having to give a certain period of notice herself. That's the key here.", "Goodness, no, that is wrong in many (if not most) jurisdictions.\n\nA verbal agreement will generally be treated as a tenancy at will. Basically a month-to-month agreement. In many jurisdictions, they are going to be just as valid as an agreement with a written lease. Where there is no written agreement, there will often be prevailing statutes at the state/county/city level that will dictate what each party's right *and responsibilties* are. Including any required notice period for both the landlord *and the tenant*. Usually, for a month-to-month rental, this will be 30 days... for either the landlord or the tenant.", "That's certainly wrong, at least in my jurisdiction.\n\nan at-will tenant must give 30 days notice, the same as the landlord"]}
