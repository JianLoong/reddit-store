My two friends had already signed a lease on an apartment before they learned I was looking for a place, they had an extra room so they asked their parents (who are on the lease and pay my friends\u2019 portions of the rent because they do not work) if I could come live with them. My one friend\u2019s dad was the one who took charge of the leasing process so he pretty much made the call with little input from the other parents. He was aware that you are technically not supposed to sublease here but was okay with it because it\u2019s a large apartment complex and the management wouldn\u2019t know that I was living here off-lease. He also knew that I was bringing a dog with me that would also not be on the lease. I pay 1/3 of the rent and utils with money that I earn at my job and have paid every month up until the current month.\n\nThe situation:\n\nFast forward 4 months later, we are one week away from the end of the semester. My friend\u2019s dad and his wife came to stay here for thanksgiving, and apparently his wife (who is a very \u201cnit picky\u201d woman) did not know I had a dog until then. \n\nSo yesterday, I wake up in the morning and hear my friend on the phone with his dad who is yelling about me needing to go, saying that I\u2019m freeloading and taking advantage and that me and my dog need to go. Towards the end of the call he says he\u2019s going to ask me for this month\u2019s rent and \u201cgo from there.\u201d Later that day he sends me his usual monthly text with a breakdown of what I need to pay for the month acting like nothing is wrong, even saying \u201cthank you in advance.\u201d This guy is going to try to collect this months rent from me then tell me I need to leave after he gets my money. Obviously I went and found a one bedroom and applied for it that day, it\u2019s an additional $300 a month to what I\u2019m paying right now and I will have to make a security deposit of $800 plus first month\u2019s rent ($800) when I sign the lease. I am also having to move during Christmas break, which is necessary because I won\u2019t have time to do it during next semester with my job (35 hours a week) and full time school. I am lucky that I heard that phone call because if I didn\u2019t learn that I needed to leave until he decided to tell me, which he hasn\u2019t yet, I don\u2019t know if I would have time to leave before next semester starts. Anyways given these circumstances and the fact that he has no legal recourse to collect this month\u2019s rent from me because there\u2019s no formal agreement, I have decided that I am going to move out and just not pay him. If he tries to press me for the rent before I\u2019m able to move out I\u2019m going to say I won\u2019t have it until my next paycheck on the 16th (happens to also be the day I plan to move out.)

Your situation is complicated by the fact that you aren't on the lease as a tenant with the property owner, but that doesn't mean you don't have rights in this situation and if anything this situation presents far more problems for your friend and his dad than for you. I am NAL but I have a lot of experience with shitty landlords and have helped others with similar problems.\n\nYou are a tenant in this situation and your friend's dad is not the landlord so they can't evict you. You do have rights as a tenant so you can only be removed by an eviction. Your bigger problem is that if the landlord discovers you are there, all of you could be evicted. Anything your friend's father tries to do is going to increase the likelihood of his own child ending up with an eviction on their record. \n\nThat said leaving and not paying for the next month instead is a totally valid way to approach this situation given that you haven't signed any kind of agreement to give notice before terminating your tenancy. In the future, many schools have services that help their students with landlord issues. Also, in the future try to avoid being in a situation where your presence is by definition a violation of the lease as you really don't want an eviction on your record.\n\nETA: made corrections based on my earlier brain fart.", "INFO: Why don't you confirm what you overheard first?", "I need some clarification.

Yes, you owe the money for December rent, and yes, it's shitty not to pay him, but basic survival and making sure you have a roof over your head takes precedence. If he chases after you and serves you with a small claims suit, you can always capitulate and offer to pay him $50-$100 a month until the debt is settled, in which case you're winning at the cash-flow game, and sucks to be him.\n\nMy judgment is ESH because you do owe the rent and your friend's dad is going to have to chase you if he wants to get it, but it's also very, very shitty to screw with a student's housing situation for no fuckin' reason.

Thanks for the advice I\u2019m going to look into it", "Legally,  op is in good shape.   With an illegal sublet,  you can't take him to court without exposing yourself to a suit.

Op is simply acting first.", "OP is already saying they won\u2019t pay for the month so I doubt it matters.

If his dad wants me gone I have to go.", "Just the way this sub is sometimes. Especially with rent or landlords.", "To further expand on that. Your friend's dad can't evict you at all. He isn't the landlord. Only a landlord can evict you. If you have stayed there for more than 30 days you have tenant rights. To evict you now would require the landlord to serve you a notice of eviction, which would typically give you 30 days to leave. If you decide to contest the eviction, you often can stay in the rental until your court case is decided, which could be a few months. \n\nIf he wants to evict you now he would have to tell the apartment complex management company that he has violated his lease by allowing a sublease. They would have to evict EVERYONE on the lease, not just you. They also would likely come after all of you for money for the dog. So yeah, I would move because that guy is going to make your life difficult. But your name isn't on a lease and you've lived there long enough to have tenant rights. If you *want* to stay, his kid is going to have more legal trouble than you will from the eviction process. Arguably since you have no written agreement but have lived there for an extended time, you could just stop paying rent now and let him try to evict you.

Really?", "Ignore them and just leave. You don't have to have long conversations with anyone; you know you are being kicked out, and it's better to leave on your own than wait, and talk, and talk, and talk, and then get kicked out.

It\u2019d be reckless not to.", "Also, it's an unauthorized subtenancy.  The Dad is going to have to jump through major legal hoops to enforce that contract in most US jurisdictions.

But, no matter what the Dad does it will be a whole lot of headache for $500.", "This is not correct. In most places in the US, notice is required by whoever is ending the lease. Usually 30 days, though *this* will vary by location. You may leave earlier, but you are generally required to pay out the notice period.", "They mentioned that the two roommates are in a lease agreement with a management company that does not allow subleases. \n\nIf they try to argue that there is somehow a lease agreement with OP then they would be admitting to breaking the terms of their own lease. \n\nWhich would not be a smart decision.", "Sure, except OP's not on a lease, so none of that applies to her.", "Oh, god, if OP is in the US, that's very incorrect. OP pays rent. They are a month-to-month tenant, with the rights of a tenant. A written lease is not necessary.", "The dad in this case is actively breaking his lease agreement by allowing the sublet. Wouldn\u2019t be smart for the dad to push on OP as OP can and should inform the management company if that happens.", "Honey, yes, OP has the **rights** of a tenant regardless of whether she's on a formal lease or not.

In many jurisdictions, they are going to be just as valid as an agreement with a written lease.
