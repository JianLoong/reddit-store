{"id": 24693, "submission_id": "15rtgm5", "title": "AITA for being mad that my step daughter will inherit our house", "selftext": "My husband (65) and I (47) have been married for 10 years. After my husband\u2019s retirement party, the discussion of wills and inheritance came up and my husband informed me that he is leaving our marital home to his daughter (30) in his will which left me feeling completely blindsided and shocked. \n\nI am aware that due to our significant age difference, I will mostly likely outline husband by many years and will probably have to spend the last decades of my life alone. So I was really upset but also angry to learn I will most likely be kicked out of our house after my husband\u2019s death and left homeless. My husband explained to me that I knew the house belonged to his late wife who inherited it from her parents and that I couldn\u2019t possibly expect him not to leave his house to their daughter.\n\nI replied that the house now belongs to him and as his wife I have a right to my marital home and it\u2019s not fair that I will be kicked out of our home after I spend so much time and effort redecorating it and making it my own and become homeless after his death because I am a housewife and have nowhere else to go, he has an obligation to ensure my financial safety after his death. He said that it will be incredibly unfair to his daughter and his late wife if I inherit the house and his wife would have never wanted that. His wife died unexpectedly at a relatively young age before she got around to making a will so my husband automatically got the house as per inheritance laws. He also explained that I am the sole beneficiary of his life insurance and any savings left will be equally divided between me and his daughter. However, I don\u2019t think this money would be enough for me survive the rest of my life especially as my husband plans on having expensive cruises and holidays for the rest of his retirement. \n\nThis is where, unfortunately, our argument escalated and we starting yelling at each other. I told him he is screwing me over after everything I have done for him, after I gave up my job and my career for him to look after our home and that I deserve to be compensated. He retorted that he never asked me to become a housewife and it was completely my own choice, that I knew the risks and benefits and made an informed choice and he will be leaving a reasonable inheritance and if I am not happy with it I should go back to work. I told him I never knew that I wouldn\u2019t get the house and that it\u2019s late for me to return after being out for over 10 years. That he is an a**hole for leaving me stranded like this and that this is not what I agreed to and he is being a sexist prick by not recognising my contribution to our family. He laughed at me, saying I never any kind of financial contribution, as we hired cleaners and housekeepers to do most of the chores and if anything I was a drain by all the money I spend. Honestly at this point I was so enraged and in tears, I screamed at him he is being completely cruel to m and locked myself in the guest room. \n\nSo AITA for wanting the house if my husband dies before me?", "created_utc": 1692107761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rtgm5/aita_for_being_mad_that_my_step_daughter_will/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Discussion of wills always brings out the worst in people. Stop acting entitled to a home that that was inherited by your husband's first wife. No one forced you into early retirement at 37. You have plenty of time to get a job and start investing for your future especially if your husband covers all the fixed costs for your household.", "YTA\n\nThe house belonged to his late wife who inherited it from her parents.

You're 47 and you haven't been working in years?  If you do not have a health condition then it's your own choice as a free woman to not work, meaning you chose to living off the finances of your husband.

You really expected to just pack it in at the age of 37 and live forever off the finances of your husband?  It is absolutely NOT too late to return back to work and you're only 47!  You're not being \"stranded\" you're being entitled.", "This sounds fake as hell but YTA. Quitting your job at the age of 37 to become a stay at home wife for an empty nester 20 years your senior is epically short-sighted. You made the point yourself that you are going to outlive him. You\u2019ve taken no steps to ensure your own future. Get out there and get a job. My guess is that this entire convo has a very good chance of being the beginning of the end of this marriage, so you better get your shit together. The risk of gold digging is an empty shovel.", "YTA. You decided on your 30s without your husband's approval to become a \"housewife\" when there were no minor kids to care for, doing no chores and now you are trying to steal your step daughter's inheritance. I'm glad your husband had the sense to not screw over his daughter after you come into the picture.\n\nGet a job, your husband is retired now, he can take care of the house, no problem. Start building a nest egg for yourself. If you are homeless after he passes, it will be your own fault for not taking caring of yourself. \n\nHave you been adding to your retirement accounts in all this time?", "\"Housewife\" who does no housework and is apparently not raising any children either?

You are viewing your marriage as a complete business deal and all I kept seeing is money this, money that, in your post. In my opinion, he should leave you right now.", "YTA it\u2019s his deceased wife\u2019s inherited house, of course his daughter would inherit the house.

It seems like you are getting a good chinch of money when he passes so figure it out from there", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a house from your husband\u2019s previous wife - of course it should go to their daughter. Imagine how you\u2019d feel if you were in his daughter\u2019s shoes, and stepmom got her mom\u2019s family home when her dad passed\u2026 I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d be put out.\n\nYou married an older guy and expected to be set for life.

Why don\u2019t you get a job then to provide yourself financial security? Did you marry someone 18 years older than you to purposefully never have to support yourself?

Weird but whatever", "So you weren't a stay-at-home mother, because your stepdaughter was 20 when you and your husband married.  You don't mention any other kids.  You weren't really a housewife, because a house with only a couple of adults living in it that has a cleaning service really doesn't require a full time housewife.  It sounds like you've gotten ten years of idle luxury out of this deal so far, and now you want your husband's dead wife's house so that you can continue it forever.  And you want it at the expense of her daughter.\n\nBut that's not how life usually works.  Most people have to work, to make a contribution in some way.  Either as a parent, a worker, or something.

Realistically if you have not been paying a mortgage or rent this entire time, as a couple, then you should have plenty of cash. That cash is also earning money while invested.

Your husband only got the house because she passed away. He wants his daughter to have her mom's house. \n\n>it\u2019s late for me to return after being out for over 10 years.\n\nNo, it's not. You just don't want to work again. You've spent 10+ years relying on your husband's money and the mistaken belief that you'd get the house. You even admit there are housekeepers doing the chores. There's been plenty of time for you to have a job.  \n\nIf you're that worried about your future after he dies, start prepping now. Get a job. Build up your personal finances.

After my husband\u2019s retirement party, the discussion of wills and inheritance came up and my husband informed me that he is leaving our marital home to his daughter (30) in his will which left me feeling completely blindsided and shocked. \n\nI am aware that due to our significant age difference, I will mostly likely outline husband by many years and will probably have to spend the last decades of my life alone. So I was really upset but also angry to learn I will most likely be kicked out of our house after my husband\u2019s death and left homeless. My husband explained to me that I knew the house belonged to his late wife who inherited it from her parents and that I couldn\u2019t possibly expect him not to leave his house to their daughter.\n\nI replied that the house now belongs to him and as his wife I have a right to my marital home and it\u2019s not fair that I will be kicked out of our home after I spend so much time and effort redecorating it and making it my own and become homeless after his death because I am a housewife and have nowhere else to go, he has an obligation to ensure my financial safety after his death. He said that it will be incredibly unfair to his daughter and his late wife if I inherit the house and his wife would have never wanted that. His wife died unexpectedly at a relatively young age before she got around to making a will so my husband automatically got the house as per inheritance laws. He also explained that I am the sole beneficiary of his life insurance and any savings left will be equally divided between me and his daughter. However, I don\u2019t think this money would be enough for me survive the rest of my life especially as my husband plans on having expensive cruises and holidays for the rest of his retirement. \n\nThis is where, unfortunately, our argument escalated and we starting yelling at each other. I told him he is screwing me over after everything I have done for him, after I gave up my job and my career for him to look after our home and that I deserve to be compensated. He retorted that he never asked me to become a housewife and it was completely my own choice, that I knew the risks and benefits and made an informed choice and he will be leaving a reasonable inheritance and if I am not happy with it I should go back to work. I told him I never knew that I wouldn\u2019t get the house and that it\u2019s late for me to return after being out for over 10 years. That he is an a**hole for leaving me stranded like this and that this is not what I agreed to and he is being a sexist prick by not recognising my contribution to our family. He laughed at me, saying I never any kind of financial contribution, as we hired cleaners and housekeepers to do most of the chores and if anything I was a drain by all the money I spend. Honestly at this point I was so enraged and in tears, I screamed at him he is being completely cruel to m and locked myself in the guest room. \n\nSo AITA for wanting the house if my husband dies before me?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So much animosity.\n\nYeah - and such a sense of entitlement to things she's not entitled to.\n\nI am still curious how big this life insurance plan is that is \"not enough.\" I have an odd feeling that it, and/or some of her shopping trips is bigger than my retirement plan at this stage.", "I think it's pretty fair, considering the house is actually inheritance she's going to be getting from her mother thanks to her father, because it was her mom's house before she passed away. Well her mom did not have a will to state that the house should go to her daughter, her dad is doing the right thing. The money that he has is the inheritance he is leaving, and it makes sense that he would split it equally between his wife and his daughter.\n\nHis daughter getting the house is her inheritance from her mother, whether it's legally set up that way or not. That is how it should be looked at, because that's the truth of it.", "Or OP here could get off her ass and get herself a job and take care of herself. \n\nHe can leave his money to whomever he chooses, that's what's \"fair\" people are disgusting when they talk about their inheritance\" She's complaining that he likes to spend his own money on cruises, because that means there will be less for her in the future, it's gross. \n\nI hope the husband ditches her and has a good prenup, leaving gold digger here broke.", "Yeah, she was 37 when they got married and decided not to work anymore. He\u2019s been working the entire time. Adding in the fact they hire a maid it\u2019s very hard to see what equity she should have in existing assets \n\nSounds like someone needs to get a job", "I mean the man prolly got a prenup and he could create a trust to protect his assets and name his daughter as a trustee.", "Meh. I think calling her out on the bullshit was necessary. OP clearly thinks she contributes more than she does. Sounds like the husband was fine with her not working.", "How has he been leading her on? Did he ever tell her she'd be getting his late wife's family home? Did she ever ask before now? I would imagine that he assumed that anyone with half a brain (that isn't a gold digger) would know that they aren't entitled to and won't be \"inheriting\") a house that had been handed down through multiple generations of his late wife's/daughter's family.", "I don't know if either of those points are relevant from a legal perspective. \n\nThe relevant legislation would be the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975, but this isn't a legal advice subreddit.", "If that's why he married her then she was doing what was expected of her though.", "She\u2019s getting a lot of money so it shouldn\u2019t be an issue. And at 47 she\u2019s still got a while to work/start a career and be ready for when it happens.", "If the step daughter has always resented op living in the house I doubt she'll let her rent it from her, she'll probably kick her out of it asap.", "He\u2019s leaving his whole inheritance to her. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s set but she just wants everything and wants her husbands daughter to have nothing.", "In my jurisdiction it would not be considered marital property, as it was inheritance prior to the marriage.", "It's the husband's choice to leave it to whomever he wants.  The only thing that is hers is half of the appreciation since they married.\n\nIt's more the daughter's than the wife's, in this case, since his late wife inherited it from her parents, and he inherited it from her.", ">The real question is was this in writing or a verbal agreement with the mother?\n\nPerhaps if this were r/legaladvice or r/LegalAdviceUK \\- but this is r/AmItheAsshole \\- so whether it is legally enforceable isn't relevant to the argument.", "The equity gained while married is divided in half, not the entire house. You can\u2019t divide what you don\u2019t own. She would be entitled to half of the appreciation in value of the house.", "Me too!", "I can't imagine not earning any money during prime work years. I think in a way the spouse is also an asshole because he could have given the house to his daughter and bought a new abode for his new marriage", "She's been keeping house - granted an easy task - and he never raised any complaint here. He made it clear he was perfectly happy with this arrangement.\n\nNow, that's fine. If he wants a trophy wife, that's up to him, but if he has a trophy wife then she's still his wife.\n\nGenerally when you're married to a working man, the man provides for you after his death. It's not a ridiculous expectation.", "Well let\u2019s just hope that the husband transfers it to his daughter prior to death to avoid this very issue. OP has no legal ownership of the house..\n\nIt absolutely should go to the daughter like the husband and his late wife would have intended for it to.", "Right from the OP as said to her by her husband: \n\n\"He retorted that he never asked me to become a housewife and it was completely my own choice, that I knew the risks and benefits and made an informed choice\"", "Yes, it's his choice, and it's one that she has every right to take personally. \n\nTypically when a spouse dies, the other maintains the life they lived and continues on with everything they had -- children don't receive inheritance until everyone above them has passed away. To go against this societal norm is insulting to the OP.", "I don't think anyone would be the asshole for not wanting their home of 10 years ripped out under them while also dealing with the death of their spouse, that sounds like quite possibly one of the worst things you could go through", "Maybe, but she was only 20. Maybe that\u2019s his plan, or maybe the plan is just to make the daughter her landlord after he passes if she doesn\u2019t want to live there", ">She's been keeping house\n\nNo, she has housekeepers for that. He seemed fine with the current arrangement until she started demanding the house that she has no right to.", ">Well let\u2019s just hope that the husband transfers it to his daughter prior to death to avoid this very issue.\n\nThat would be covered under section 10 of the act, and so wouldn't actually help.\n\n>OP has no legal ownership of the house..\n\nWhat makes you say this? What seems just and fair, and what is legal aren't always the same.", "It's easy for him to say that it was all her decision & he never asked her to do any of that after the fact, though. In reality he could have been putting a lot of pressure on her to stay, or saying very little about the risks of leaving the workforce, or otherwise making it evident to her that he'd prefer she stayed home and did all the things he's now knocking her for.\n\nAnd it seems to me that if they didn't have this convo about \"where will OP live after spouse dies (and OP presumably has several more decades left)\" when OP left the workforce, then OP *didn't* know all the risks."]}
