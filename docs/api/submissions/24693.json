{"id": 24693, "submission_id": "15rtgm5", "title": "AITA for being mad that my step daughter will inherit our house", "selftext": "My husband (65) and I (47) have been married for 10 years. After my husband\u2019s retirement party, the discussion of wills and inheritance came up and my husband informed me that he is leaving our marital home to his daughter (30) in his will which left me feeling completely blindsided and shocked. \n\nI am aware that due to our significant age difference, I will mostly likely outline husband by many years and will probably have to spend the last decades of my life alone. So I was really upset but also angry to learn I will most likely be kicked out of our house after my husband\u2019s death and left homeless. My husband explained to me that I knew the house belonged to his late wife who inherited it from her parents and that I couldn\u2019t possibly expect him not to leave his house to their daughter.\n\nI replied that the house now belongs to him and as his wife I have a right to my marital home and it\u2019s not fair that I will be kicked out of our home after I spend so much time and effort redecorating it and making it my own and become homeless after his death because I am a housewife and have nowhere else to go, he has an obligation to ensure my financial safety after his death. He said that it will be incredibly unfair to his daughter and his late wife if I inherit the house and his wife would have never wanted that. His wife died unexpectedly at a relatively young age before she got around to making a will so my husband automatically got the house as per inheritance laws. He also explained that I am the sole beneficiary of his life insurance and any savings left will be equally divided between me and his daughter. However, I don\u2019t think this money would be enough for me survive the rest of my life especially as my husband plans on having expensive cruises and holidays for the rest of his retirement. \n\nThis is where, unfortunately, our argument escalated and we starting yelling at each other. I told him he is screwing me over after everything I have done for him, after I gave up my job and my career for him to look after our home and that I deserve to be compensated. He retorted that he never asked me to become a housewife and it was completely my own choice, that I knew the risks and benefits and made an informed choice and he will be leaving a reasonable inheritance and if I am not happy with it I should go back to work. I told him I never knew that I wouldn\u2019t get the house and that it\u2019s late for me to return after being out for over 10 years. That he is an a**hole for leaving me stranded like this and that this is not what I agreed to and he is being a sexist prick by not recognising my contribution to our family. He laughed at me, saying I never any kind of financial contribution, as we hired cleaners and housekeepers to do most of the chores and if anything I was a drain by all the money I spend. Honestly at this point I was so enraged and in tears, I screamed at him he is being completely cruel to m and locked myself in the guest room. \n\nSo AITA for wanting the house if my husband dies before me?\n\n\n\nEdit: okay I got it, I am the YTA. I will apologise to my husband and try to look for a job, this time something not so stressful and something I will enjoy and build my own savings. I do not want to divorce my husband and take half. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t marry him for money. I didn\u2019t even know he was wealthy until 6 months into our relationship. Honestly, when I met him I was done with dating and so jaded with men after being cheated on quite a bit, until he came along and honestly kinda swept me off my feet, he was so thoughtful, kind and loyal and our socio-political opinions just matched- we saw the world in a similar manner and I never thought I would be with someone much older but he was everything I have ever wanted.\n\nI used to work in customer service jobs and in my last job I was a 999 call handler and yeah it was really bad for my mental health and I made minimum wage. My husband encouraged me to do something I enjoy instead as he saw how it stressed me out. Although I did intend to find a more relaxing job, honestly yeah I enjoyed being at home and pursuing hobbies and doing things at my own pace. I admit it was a really comfortable life and I let him financially take care of me and become financially dependent on him, it was way easier than the grating and the grinding.\n\nI had grown really attached to the house which I wouldn\u2019t have done had I known it wouldn\u2019t ever be mine or that I would be kicked out of it at some point. I honestly didn\u2019t know it belonged to his late wife\u2019s parent and I was just so shocked and blindsided. I just thought his wife\u2019s name was on the deed as she was the main earner at that time. But yeah I realise it\u2019s completely my fault for assuming and that I was acting entitled. I will apologise to my husband and my step daughter", "created_utc": 1692107761, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rtgm5/aita_for_being_mad_that_my_step_daughter_will/", "score": 4819, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Discussion of wills always brings out the worst in people. Stop acting entitled to a home that that was inherited by your husband's first wife. No one forced you into early retirement at 37. You have plenty of time to get a job and start investing for your future especially if your husband covers all the fixed costs for your household.", "YTA\n\nThe house belonged to his late wife who inherited it from her parents.

You're 47 and you haven't been working in years?  If you do not have a health condition then it's your own choice as a free woman to not work, meaning you chose to living off the finances of your husband.  You cannot throw around words like sexism when you are using it as an advantage (ie being a stay at home wife).  You really expected to just pack it in at the age of 37 and live forever off the finances of your husband?  It is absolutely NOT too late to return back to work and you're only 47!  You're not being \"stranded\" you're being entitled.", "This sounds fake as hell but YTA. Quitting your job at the age of 37 to become a stay at home wife for an empty nester 20 years your senior is epically short-sighted. You made the point yourself that you are going to outlive him. You\u2019ve taken no steps to ensure your own future. Get out there and get a job. My guess is that this entire convo has a very good chance of being the beginning of the end of this marriage, so you better get your shit together. The risk of gold digging is an empty shovel.", "YTA. You decided on your 30s without your husband's approval to become a \"housewife\" when there were no minor kids to care for, doing no chores and now you are trying to steal your step daughter's inheritance. I'm glad your husband had the sense to not screw over his daughter after you come into the picture.\n\nGet a job, your husband is retired now, he can take care of the house, no problem. Start building a nest egg for yourself. If you are homeless after he passes, it will be your own fault for not taking caring of yourself. \n\nHave you been adding to your retirement accounts in all this time?", "\"Housewife\" who does no housework and is apparently not raising any children either?

Weird but whatever", "So you weren't a stay-at-home mother, because your stepdaughter was 20 when you and your husband married.  You don't mention any other kids.  You weren't really a housewife, because a house with only a couple of adults living in it that has a cleaning service really doesn't require a full time housewife.  It sounds like you've gotten ten years of idle luxury out of this deal so far, and now you want your husband's dead wife's house so that you can continue it forever.  And you want it at the expense of her daughter.\n\nBut that's not how life usually works.  Most people have to work, to make a contribution in some way.  Either as a parent, a worker, or something.

After my husband\u2019s retirement party, the discussion of wills and inheritance came up and my husband informed me that he is leaving our marital home to his daughter (30) in his will which left me feeling completely blindsided and shocked. \n\nI am aware that due to our significant age difference, I will mostly likely outline husband by many years and will probably have to spend the last decades of my life alone. So I was really upset but also angry to learn I will most likely be kicked out of our house after my husband\u2019s death and left homeless. My husband explained to me that I knew the house belonged to his late wife who inherited it from her parents and that I couldn\u2019t possibly expect him not to leave his house to their daughter.\n\nI replied that the house now belongs to him and as his wife I have a right to my marital home and it\u2019s not fair that I will be kicked out of our home after I spend so much time and effort redecorating it and making it my own and become homeless after his death because I am a housewife and have nowhere else to go, he has an obligation to ensure my financial safety after his death. He said that it will be incredibly unfair to his daughter and his late wife if I inherit the house and his wife would have never wanted that. His wife died unexpectedly at a relatively young age before she got around to making a will so my husband automatically got the house as per inheritance laws. He also explained that I am the sole beneficiary of his life insurance and any savings left will be equally divided between me and his daughter. However, I don\u2019t think this money would be enough for me survive the rest of my life especially as my husband plans on having expensive cruises and holidays for the rest of his retirement. \n\nThis is where, unfortunately, our argument escalated and we starting yelling at each other.

It\u2019s why I personally think leaving a career to be a housewife can trap someone later on if they need to go back to work for whatever reason. But that\u2019s no excuse to not even try.  And at least OP won\u2019t have crazy health insurance costs to deal with (assuming UK).\n\nEverything else I 100% agree with. It\u2019s not her home to inherit and she sounds like a gold digger who got complacent.", "Omg I thought it had to be a joke too especially when she spoke about having cleaners etc and she chose to stop working to live off him. I think it\u2019s real though. 100% YTA.", "She found gold alright, fools gold, and she's the bigger fool.", "What I want to know is WHEN DID HE SAY THIS IS YOURS ??", "Exactly! I was at SAHM mom for 15 years. I got my first job at the age of 33 years old(currently am 35). The first place I applied to hired me even though I had no work experience. It was a hotel receptionist job but I ended up loving it.", "And she has gotten a 10 year vacation and his life insurance and a portion of his savings when he does die.", "I mean he could out live her. If you make it to 65 healthy, which it sounds like he did, you van easily make it to 80 woth propper Healthcare in this country. She could be unhealthy right now.", "I was questioning myself over that comment because that was a very misogynistic take on that movie. Yours is more like I remember that movie.", "The stepmom sounds fucking awful and I doubt the daughter wants to be anywhere near her. Not only that, the daughter owes her absolutely nothing. Stepmom is a woman who leeches off her dad for what could be decades.", "After reading this I have just put it on, HBO.  Sean Astin is in too, I never knew that haha!", "That's what some savvy realtors/developers do, they write hundreds of notes to home owners. My parents have bought, through out their life probably, 20 properties in that way.", "I mean we can only go off of what she says, and based on her edit she does seem like she is in a more reasonable headspace now and is using the comments here as constructive criticism. She said that it had never been talked about in the past and I\u2019m inclined to believe her because this argument probably would have happened already if he had brought it up before.", "Yeah, I never understood the \"I would be so bored\" people. I would never rely on someone else financially but if I ever won the lottery, where I would need to work anymore, you best believe I would do a whole lot of nothing. I can lay on the couch scrolling reddit all day and I wouldn't be bored. I never had an innate drive to do something productive. I do it because I have to. If it was up to me I would sleep half the day and eat the other half. And if I got, guess what I would do? Travel the world. Eat native dishes, do tours. But never ever would I think to myself: you know what? You should get another job to combat boredom. Not gonna happen.", "Can we start calling out men who marry much younger women as well though?\n\nIf this post is real OP is obviously delusional, but like- did they not discuss any of this before getting married? Did the husband not realize that him being much older, and wealthy, may mean that he needs to be smart about his family\u2019s future?", "The whole \"I'll be homelesssssss,\" just gets me. If she is being left life insurance, and half of his estate, minus the house, she will not be out on the street. What she means to say is \"I will lose the place I spent my husband's money to decorate to my satisfaction while I didn't contribute anything to it financially.\"\n\nIf I was the stepdaughter, I'd be shaking my head in disbelief and asking my dad if he knew the kind of person he'd married before all this.", "I agree she\u2019s the asshole but I think the answer to your question is pretty obvious- he probably wanted a younger woman, and she\u2019s one that gave him attention. \n\nIn stories like this, I feel like everyone (understandably) attacks the \u201cgold digger,\u201d but nobody points out that the rich person is also superficial- just in a different way", "But wait! According to her update, she didn\u2019t know he was wealthy until an entire 6 months after they started dating! Because we all know 100% that we want to marry someone before that time. \n\nNo way can a person be swayed into marrying someone after learning someone\u2019s wealthy a whole 6 months after into dating.", "This got me too. Like why wouldn\u2019t he spend all his money and enjoy his time off.", "Why is that, exactly? Who says that she HAS to have kids to \u201cjustify\u201d (to who?) being a SAHW. That is their business and apparently he\u2019s fine with it. They aren\u2019t struggling college kids, they are full grown adults with assets and it\u2019s no reflection on her character that she isn\u2019t working and paying everything 50/50. They are a married couple. Everyone is acting like she\u2019s a 22 year old live in sugar baby instead of an almost 50 year old wife of 10 years currently.", "Yes but she says during their argument he told her she did know. \nAnd she said herself she'd seen the deed to the house and saw his first wife's name on it.\nIt's hard to imagine that in 10 years of marriage it never came up that his wife's parents lived in that house.\n\nI'm in personal opinion territory now, but I honestly believe that she may have known that it was his wife's but she still thought that her' 10 years of hard labor' meant that it belonged to her", "I'd agree.\n\nWhat my grandma's second husband did was put in his will that she could live in the house but it'd pass to his daughter when my gran died.\n\nOf course, the age gap here probably also rules that out"]}
