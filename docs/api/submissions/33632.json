My husband is from South Africa but I am French. So our wedding in the Savanah in South Africa was a huge trip for the 13 French guests.\nWe rented a beautiful lodge where you see lions, elephants, etc. And to thank everyone for coming all this way, we rented it for 2 days. \nDay 1 : Wedding. Day 2 : pool party.\n\nWe only invited 30 people, the people we love.\nI had a huge argument with my aunt (38F) 8 years ago and we cut ties ever since. But doing the invitations, I thought about how close we used to be. I decided to invite her.\n\nThere was no +1 for anyone and so I only invited my aunt. Not her partner or her kid since I barely knew their names.\n\nMy aunt said she was happy but insisted that we invite them. I told her no, but my mom teamed with her and pressured me A LOT during the year.\nI explained that the ceremony meant everything to us and that we only want people we love to be present. \n\nBut my aunt booked flights for her but also for her family. She said it was a family trip but added that she heard some of my guests cancelled and so that there is now space for her family. I told her that it would not be happening but that her family could join us for the pool party the next day.\n\nAfter that, I got even more pressured by my mom into inviting them for the wedding itself because \u00ab\u00a0they are coming all this way\u00a0\u00bb.\nBut I kept refusing and tried to finish my dress without my mom.\n\nOn the big day, after the ceremony, my husband and I left for an hour in the Savannah with the photographers to make a few photos.\nAs soon as we came back to the lodge, my aunt came to me, smirking. She was holding her kid, her partner was behind her.\n\nI\u2019m not the scandal type, I didn\u2019t know how to react. In my disbelief, I kissed the kid hello and shook hand with her partner. I immediately felt sad for not defending myself.\n\nI then heard my mom and grandma telling my aunt about the extra chairs and food we had and that her family must stay for diner.\n\nMy sister lied for me, saying we don\u2019t have enough chairs because some are broken.\nSo my aunt announced that they were leaving. \nI asked why leaving with them, she was supposed to stay for the dinner and they are only 5 mn away. \nShe replied that she never intended to stay for dinner but that she will spend time with us when they come back tomorrow for the pool party day.\nI was shocked.\n\nI replied that I had a change of plans and that she and her family could not come for the next day anymore. \nMy mom, usually lovely, lost it and told me that I had no right to cancel my aunt\u2019s invitation to the pool party. \nI reminded her that we paid for the whole wedding ourselves and that she has no say in who I host. \nAnd I walked away. \nBut she yelled at my back in front of everyone.

It seems like your aunt had every intention of doing exactly what she wanted to do with your mother\u2019s help, and for what?  Grudges and entitlement make people do some very ugly things. Did she show up after all that travel and expense just to show you her power?  Why didn\u2019t your mom care about your wedding being the perfect day for you, not her sister? It\u2019s all just being hateful the sake of doing it. It\u2019s all very sad to me but NTA. It was your wedding and you paid for it. Who participated was up to you.", " NTA. The fact that she went on your wedding day with her family as a big \u201cfuck you, I do whatever I want\u201d and immediately left? Ohhh I\u2019d be furious. I think what you did was right and if it was me, I would have honestly told my mum \u201cyou can leave too if don\u2019t like it\u201d The nerve some people have to believe they can walk all over others and impose their wants as if they ruled the world.", "I'm gonna say NTA because of how much pressure everyone was putting on you when you made it clear **but** your aunt wasn't required to attend the dinner that her family wasn't invited to. You can't really have it both ways.", "NTA, you should have stuck to your initial feeling and not have invited her. You should have told your mom to butt out when the pressure started a year ago.

I don't get all the you the asshole comments at all.\n\nShe had one invitation. She turned up with additional guests you explicitly said were not invited. You should have told her to fuck off right there and then. It was perfectly reasonable to rescind the invitation for the next day.\n\nDoesn't matter who the hell you are. If you don't have an invitation you don't crash someone's wedding.", "NTA.  Well, I guess it\u2019s time to cut ties with your aunt again.  Maybe reach out in another 8 years and check if she\u2019s still an AH?", "ESH - you for inviting someone to a destination wedding without a plus 1, with no regard for the time, effort and expense involved for them and the fact that that might be their only opportunity for a family holiday in that year.\n\nYour aunt for not simply declining the invite if she didn't like the terms. No one should have put pressure on or made a scene.", "ESH, this is petty. France to South Africa is a trek your aunt perhaps didn\u2019t want to make alone. It\u2019s wild to me when people have really difficult wedding locations and don\u2019t seem to appreciate the effort, time, and expense it takes for guests to attend. \n\nOf course your aunt was impolite here. She asked, you said no, that should have been that. It\u2019s an awkward situation. Everyone was inflexible and everyone sucks here.", "NTA. I don\u2019t care about tickets, travel time or anything else. No one has the right to ruin your special day/weekend. Family can be so entitled just because. Kudos to you for standing your ground.", "ESH\n\nYour aunt and your mother for making a scene at the wedding (and here I think you mother was worse).\n\nYou because inviting someone on such a trip, wedding destination not only in another country but also on another continent without your SO, without your family, is not very polite in itself. And the truth is you didn't want her there anyway you just had to stick to your opinion and invite only those who didn't mind leaving their families at home. Theoretically, you can do anything because it's your wedding and your party, but in practice it doesn't mean that you are always right just because you are a bride and everyone should understand everything.", "NTA. You are paying for the whole wedding yourself so no one has the right to tell you what to do.", "ESH. It\u2019s generally rude to invite only one person to a destination wedding and not the rest of their family. I\u2019ve never known anyone who isn\u2019t single to travel to a different continent on their own. You should have invited her whole family from the beginning if you were going to invite her. And once you knew they were all traveling together anyway, you should have let them come to the wedding. \n\nYeah, it was rude of her to show up with them anyway and it was rude of your mom and grandma to tell them it was okay. But this all could have been avoided if you had either invited all of them from the beginning or none of them.", "ESH: your family for being so pushy and disrespectful to your wishes, you haven\u2019t spoken to this woman on over 8 years and extend and olive branch which she shits all over. But I\u2019m her defence if she doesn\u2019t want to go without family, that\u2019s up to her and you said her family can join for the pool party so what\u2019s the problem with her not being there for the dinner but being there for the dinner, a fair compromise that you lost your shit at making you also a massive AH.", "NTA. It\u2019s your special day and your aunt crossed every boundary. What\u2019s worse is your mum taking her side. Im sorry and try to enjoy your time in South Africa as much as possible", "ESH.", "I have no idea what fucking happened in this story. So aunt and her family came after the ceremony and left in short time? What's the drama is about? If your aunt was holding the kid, it means her kid is a toddler. You mad because she took her toddler with her to congratulate you on your wedding day and left as soon as possible?\n\nYTA, of course. If only for no plus 1 rule for the wedding in freaking Africa.", "ESH, personally I think it\u2019s impolite to only invite half of a couple, let alone a married couple, especially when it\u2019s a destination wedding. If you can\u2019t afford to invite everyone\u2019s partners then don\u2019t pay for everyone, only pay for close friends and family and then people can make the choice whether they want to pay for them and their partner to attend or not. \n\nBut your aunt and mum were both incredibly entitled and made your wedding about them, if going alone bothered your aunt that much then she should\u2019ve declined the invitation.", "Yta for doubling down and making the situation way worse. \n\nNot everything has to be a win you need to choose your battles (that will serve you well in marriage)\n\nInstead of the story bring your aunt rudely showed up with uninvited guests (which btw married partners are always invited ...) it's now how you were exclusionary and rude to people who flew around the globe to attend your wedding.", "ESH", "YTA- you had a destination wedding where no one could bring a +1? You sound exhausting and entitled. Surprised anyone showed up.", "YTA, you cancelled her invite for the following day as retaliation.  You invited your aunt with no family invite when she has a small child??? That's fine if it's a local wedding,  but a wedding that requires significant travel?  You make an exception for your aunt or you don't invite her. \n\nYelling and screaming, that is so classy of your mother. Edited.", "YTA, so these people are pretty much your uncle and cousin. If you didn't want them coming, you shouldn't have invited the aunt at all.", "Not the ah in the slightest.  Your Aunt and mom are though", "EDIT: I had a bad take it seems. Thanks for clarifying it.", "ESH/NTA - She's the AH for bring her family to a ceremony that they weren't invited to (although apparently you didn't even notice until after) However, she wasn't required to attend the dinner, and it was completely within her rights to opt out, so you getting upset and banning her from the event she was invited to, and travelled from France to attend, was a little petty and dramatic. Your mom is also an AH for screaming at you like that, the party was the next day she should've STFU and talked to you calming later about it, not screech at you in the middle of your wedding day festivities.\n\nThe reason I added the NTA is because, like others have mentioned, you were probably very stressed from all the wedding planning, and your mom had pressured you a LOT. It doesn't give you a get out of AH jail completely free card, but it certainly makes your actions more understandable.  \n\n\nEdit given clarification from OP: NTA: it was AH for her to leave since she reserved a place for dinner, while not intending to stay for it.", "Good for you!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There is another detail that I couldn\u2019t give because of the character limit : The wedding took place in a private reserve. Which means the gates close at 9pm. Our lodge had a max capacity of 10. So I was hosting with for 3 nights (for free) 8 guests (my mom and grandma included). But the other guests had to find their own accommodation. And to avoid being forced leaving early to make the gate, they needed to find accommodation inside the reserve.\n\nAnd it was tough because there isn\u2019t many.\n\nIn the end my mother in law did not find one and neither did my aunt. But at the last minute a cheap cute Airbnb got available and I was the one to find it. I talked about it and my aunt said she needed it or else she would not stay for the dinner at all. She said that it was because I didn\u2019t invite her partner, she didn\u2019t want to drive all the way out of the reserve alone in the dark so she would leave at 5pm max. Unless I give her the Airbnb I found (instead of giving it to my mother in law). I though it was a fair ask and sent it to her on the spot. And so she booked it.\n\nSo when she said that she never intended to stay for the dinner, it was another weird power move against me.\n\nMy mother in law would have loved that Airbnb but because I sent it to my aunt, she had to leave right after the dinner.", "No, that\u2019s just the classic \u201efuck around and find out\u201c.

Why would pay someone hundreds of \u20ac to travel to an event they aren\u2019t invited to? \n\n6.

You said they couldn't come to the ceremony, but could come to the pool party, and that's what they planned to do.\n\nWhat was so shocking?", "Your aunt, in fact, traveled the world in order to bring her family who weren't invited to your very small wedding because she and your mom were in cahoots behind your back.\n\nSo no, I would say it was lucky for your mom that you didn't ask her to leave with your aunt's family.\n\nYou might want to hang out with your husband's family, or a family of choice, or anything but your actual family after this.  \n\nI'm so sorry this happened at your wedding, but wow, you've got a backbone!  \n\nNTA", "Info\n\nWhat year did wedding etiquette change that spouses were excluded from wedding invitations?", "Yes", "YTA\n\nAs the bride, I\u2019d have preferred less drama and invited the additional 2 people. Not inviting partner is ridiculous in my opinion. Might as well not invite at all.", "YTA, if I'm reading this correctly: Your aunt did miss the wedding, as you wanted. She did have an invitation to the pool party. She brought a couple people who were not invited, and you barred her from the pool party?", "Agree! Also, what was really the big issue with letting them go to the wedding once they where there? It doesnt mean what she did was not wrong but you could have really let it pass and avoid such a big deal.\n\nAlso, what was the issue with her not attending the wedding but going to the pool day? It looked like a good agreement. \n\nIt sounds to me that you might had issues with boundaries before so now you are extra aware of them and extra alert about \u201cdefending your space\u201d even in situations where you aren\u2019t really being hurt and letting it pass would be really better.", "If she didn\u2019t wanna make the trek alone then she was welcome to not go at all. The rest of her party wasn\u2019t invited. You can\u2019t invite them yourself simply because you didn\u2019t wanna travel alone.", "I noticed that too lol", "I\u2019m confused too. It seems like they didn\u2019t attend the wedding like she asked and only showed up after the ceremony. It seems OP didn\u2019t like that they were there at all on Day 1  or just to the wedding and wanted them to leave and got really offended for some reason when the aunt decided to leave with them.  And because the aunt didn\u2019t want to stay without her child and partner she uninvited them for the following day. I was going with ESH but if the partner and child didn\u2019t attend the wedding like asked I\u2019m saying OP YTA.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m confused about. If I cut someone off I certainly would not be inviting them to my wedding. Name wouldn\u2019t exist in my mind. So from the post I\u2019m assuming OP invited the aunt because she felt guilty about the falling out. Maybe she was the cause of it. They are what roughly 12 years apart? Maybe the aunt was trying to be like a mom or big sister and tell her not to do something/ give an opinion she didn\u2019t want to hear. And blew up like she did when the aunt didn\u2019t want to stay for dinner.", "Right?!? \"We only invited people close to us, so I invited my aunt that I hadn't spoken to in damn near a decade after a huge argument.\" \n\nIt was a bad idea from the start. Even if you were intent on making up, that is a situation where you call and talk to the person before you extend the invitation. You talk to the person, feel her out, then talk about inviting her before you actually send the invitation. \n\nI vote ESH. This was a shit show start to finish. Who invites an estranged family member at all, much less without the husband for a destination wedding. OP's sister sounds like the most decent person of the lot.", "Slapped Aunt and mom, wow.

The gall of your aunt.  NTA", "Because *boundaries*. \n\nYour comment confuses me so much. This is a *huge* event for OP, which is and is supposed to be about OP and their partner. Someone *clearly* evading and stepping over OP\u2019s consent to mess with probably the most expensive event in their life, shouldn\u2019t just be allowed to do whatever simply because it\u2019s most convenient to do so. Unfortunately, manipulative people tend to manipulate situations so that you look like an AH for asserting your boundaries. If they\u2019d listened to OP anywhere along the line, they would have known this was not acceptable. In fact, they *did* know, and attempted to manipulate the situation to get their way anyway. Boundaries are there for a reason. So you maintain agency over your own life, and don\u2019t casually let people walk all over you, amongst other things. I agree that OP\u2019s response feels harsh, but they were backed into a corner wherein they either assert their *clearly predefined* boundaries, or bend over and let the aunt take their autonomy from them.", "\"hey everyone come celebrate me and my partner.

The guilt tripping is just an extension of that.  Your aunt had your hospitality and blew it.\n\nHowever, I think it's also important to know that when you're inviting people to something like this, it's appropriate to take at least a spouse or partner into account with a headcount.  I can also understand why she'd want to bring her kids to a family event.", "No you didn\u2019t", "Yes, I was going to say the same thing.  It seems like your aunt did what your mother told her she could do, then your mother got mad when you made decisions for yourself that contradicted hers.\n\nYour mother was the problem.

Just a rote *'you MUST invite the significant other'* because they read it so elsewhere.\n\nEVEN IF the aunt was offended that her significant other was not invited, the response should not have been to bring her family along to gate crash OP's wedding. Any reasonable person with a sense of decorum would have simply declined the invitation. It was rude and entitled of the aunt to start making demands about OP's wedding, and decide to thumb her nose at her niece by bringing the family along anyway. \n\nAt the end of the day, OP was using the invitation to extend an olive branch to an estranged family member.
