My husband is from South Africa but I am French. So our wedding in the Savanah in South Africa was a huge trip for the 13 French guests.\nWe rented a beautiful lodge where you see lions, elephants, etc. And to thank everyone for coming all this way, we rented it for 2 days. \nDay 1 : Wedding. Day 2 : pool party.\n\nWe only invited 30 people, the people we love.\nI had a huge argument with my aunt (38F) 8 years ago and we cut ties ever since. But doing the invitations, I thought about how close we used to be. I decided to invite her.\n\nThere was no +1 for anyone and so I only invited my aunt. Not her partner or her kid since I barely knew their names.\n\nMy aunt said she was happy but insisted that we invite them. I told her no, but my mom teamed with her and pressured me A LOT during the year.\nI explained that the ceremony meant everything to us and that we only want people we love to be present. \n\nBut my aunt booked flights for her but also for her family. She said it was a family trip but added that she heard some of my guests cancelled and so that there is now space for her family. I told her that it would not be happening but that her family could join us for the pool party the next day.\n\nAfter that, I got even more pressured by my mom into inviting them for the wedding itself because \u00ab\u00a0they are coming all this way\u00a0\u00bb.\nBut I kept refusing and tried to finish my dress without my mom.\n\nOn the big day, after the ceremony, my husband and I left for an hour in the Savannah with the photographers to make a few photos.\nAs soon as we came back to the lodge, my aunt came to me, smirking. She was holding her kid, her partner was behind her.\n\nI\u2019m not the scandal type, I didn\u2019t know how to react. In my disbelief, I kissed the kid hello and shook hand with her partner. I immediately felt sad for not defending myself.\n\nI then heard my mom and grandma telling my aunt about the extra chairs and food we had and that her family must stay for diner.\n\nMy sister lied for me, saying we don\u2019t have enough chairs because some are broken.\nSo my aunt announced that they were leaving. \nI asked why leaving with them, she was supposed to stay for the dinner and they are only 5 mn away. \nShe replied that she never intended to stay for dinner but that she will spend time with us when they come back tomorrow for the pool party day.\nI was shocked.\n\nI replied that I had a change of plans and that she and her family could not come for the next day anymore. \nMy mom, usually lovely, lost it and told me that I had no right to cancel my aunt\u2019s invitation to the pool party. \nI reminded her that we paid for the whole wedding ourselves and that she has no say in who I host. \nAnd I walked away. \nBut she yelled at my back in front of everyone.

It seems like your aunt had every intention of doing exactly what she wanted to do with your mother\u2019s help, and for what?  Grudges and entitlement make people do some very ugly things. Did she show up after all that travel and expense just to show you her power?  Why didn\u2019t your mom care about your wedding being the perfect day for you, not her sister? It\u2019s all just being hateful the sake of doing it. It\u2019s all very sad to me but NTA. It was your wedding and you paid for it. Who participated was up to you.", " NTA. The fact that she went on your wedding day with her family as a big \u201cfuck you, I do whatever I want\u201d and immediately left? Ohhh I\u2019d be furious. I think what you did was right and if it was me, I would have honestly told my mum \u201cyou can leave too if don\u2019t like it\u201d The nerve some people have to believe they can walk all over others and impose their wants as if they ruled the world.", "I'm gonna say NTA because of how much pressure everyone was putting on you when you made it clear **but** your aunt wasn't required to attend the dinner that her family wasn't invited to. You can't really have it both ways.", "NTA, you should have stuck to your initial feeling and not have invited her. You should have told your mom to butt out when the pressure started a year ago. But you finally did, so good for you.", "NTA\n\nin hindsight you probably should not have invited your Aunt in the first place!", "NTA in the slightest. I don't get all the you the asshole comments at all.\n\nShe had one invitation. She turned up with additional guests you explicitly said were not invited. You should have told her to fuck off right there and then. It was perfectly reasonable to rescind the invitation for the next day.\n\nDoesn't matter who the hell you are. If you don't have an invitation you don't crash someone's wedding.", "NTA.  Well, I guess it\u2019s time to cut ties with your aunt again.  Maybe reach out in another 8 years and check if she\u2019s still an AH?", "ESH - you for inviting someone to a destination wedding without a plus 1, with no regard for the time, effort and expense involved for them and the fact that that might be their only opportunity for a family holiday in that year.\n\nYour aunt for not simply declining the invite if she didn't like the terms. No one should have put pressure on or made a scene.", "ESH, this is petty. France to South Africa is a trek your aunt perhaps didn\u2019t want to make alone. It\u2019s wild to me when people have really difficult wedding locations and don\u2019t seem to appreciate the effort, time, and expense it takes for guests to attend. \n\nOf course your aunt was impolite here. She asked, you said no, that should have been that. It\u2019s an awkward situation. Everyone was inflexible and everyone sucks here.", "NTA. I don\u2019t care about tickets, travel time or anything else. No one has the right to ruin your special day/weekend. Family can be so entitled just because. Kudos to you for standing your ground.", "ESH\n\nYour aunt and your mother for making a scene at the wedding (and here I think you mother was worse).\n\nYou because inviting someone on such a trip, wedding destination not only in another country but also on another continent without your SO, without your family, is not very polite in itself. And the truth is you didn't want her there anyway you just had to stick to your opinion and invite only those who didn't mind leaving their families at home. Theoretically, you can do anything because it's your wedding and your party, but in practice it doesn't mean that you are always right just because you are a bride and everyone should understand everything.", "NTA. You are paying for the whole wedding yourself so no one has the right to tell you what to do.", "ESH. It\u2019s generally rude to invite only one person to a destination wedding and not the rest of their family. I\u2019ve never known anyone who isn\u2019t single to travel to a different continent on their own. You should have invited her whole family from the beginning if you were going to invite her. And once you knew they were all traveling together anyway, you should have let them come to the wedding. \n\nYeah, it was rude of her to show up with them anyway and it was rude of your mom and grandma to tell them it was okay. But this all could have been avoided if you had either invited all of them from the beginning or none of them.", "ESH: your family for being so pushy and disrespectful to your wishes, you haven\u2019t spoken to this woman on over 8 years and extend and olive branch which she shits all over. But I\u2019m her defence if she doesn\u2019t want to go without family, that\u2019s up to her and you said her family can join for the pool party so what\u2019s the problem with her not being there for the dinner but being there for the dinner, a fair compromise that you lost your shit at making you also a massive AH.", "NTA. It\u2019s your special day and your aunt crossed every boundary. What\u2019s worse is your mum taking her side. Im sorry and try to enjoy your time in South Africa as much as possible", "ESH.", "I have no idea what fucking happened in this story. So aunt and her family came after the ceremony and left in short time? What's the drama is about? If your aunt was holding the kid, it means her kid is a toddler. You mad because she took her toddler with her to congratulate you on your wedding day and left as soon as possible?\n\nYTA, of course. If only for no plus 1 rule for the wedding in freaking Africa.", "ESH, personally I think it\u2019s impolite to only invite half of a couple, let alone a married couple, especially when it\u2019s a destination wedding. If you can\u2019t afford to invite everyone\u2019s partners then don\u2019t pay for everyone, only pay for close friends and family and then people can make the choice whether they want to pay for them and their partner to attend or not. \n\nBut your aunt and mum were both incredibly entitled and made your wedding about them, if going alone bothered your aunt that much then she should\u2019ve declined the invitation.", "Yta for doubling down and making the situation way worse. \n\nNot everything has to be a win you need to choose your battles (that will serve you well in marriage)\n\nInstead of the story bring your aunt rudely showed up with uninvited guests (which btw married partners are always invited ...) it's now how you were exclusionary and rude to people who flew around the globe to attend your wedding.", "ESH", "YTA- you had a destination wedding where no one could bring a +1? You sound exhausting and entitled. Surprised anyone showed up.", "YTA, you cancelled her invite for the following day as retaliation.  You invited your aunt with no family invite when she has a small child??? That's fine if it's a local wedding,  but a wedding that requires significant travel?  You make an exception for your aunt or you don't invite her. \n\nYelling and screaming, that is so classy of your mother. Edited.", "YTA, so these people are pretty much your uncle and cousin. If you didn't want them coming, you shouldn't have invited the aunt at all.", "Not the ah in the slightest.  Your Aunt and mom are though", "ESH yeah the Mom and Aunt are both out of line for trying to push and intimidate, but what really gets me is the initial invitation\u2026\n\nYou didn\u2019t invite her because you had talked, reconciled, and moved on - Zero mention of it at all. No, you sent her an invite out of the blue after 8 years in some weird  flex about how you had a destination wedding. So she called your bs and actually showed up, that\u2019s why she was smirking when she showed. You both had 8 years to grow up and instead you sullied the memory of your wedding with high-school level spite. Next time, try talking first.", "ESH/NTA - She's the AH for bring her family to a ceremony that they weren't invited to (although apparently you didn't even notice until after) However, she wasn't required to attend the dinner, and it was completely within her rights to opt out, so you getting upset and banning her from the event she was invited to, and travelled from France to attend, was a little petty and dramatic. Your mom is also an AH for screaming at you like that, the party was the next day she should've STFU and talked to you calming later about it, not screech at you in the middle of your wedding day festivities.\n\nThe reason I added the NTA is because, like others have mentioned, you were probably very stressed from all the wedding planning, and your mom had pressured you a LOT. It doesn't give you a get out of AH jail completely free card, but it certainly makes your actions more understandable.  \n\n\nEdit given clarification from OP: NTA: it was AH for her to leave since she reserved a place for dinner, while not intending to stay for it.", "Good for you!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I really invited her with the heart, hoping we could pick up things were we left them and have nice relationship again, we were really close, she means a lot to me. \n\nWhen I say that I was flexible inviting her, I mean it was obviously still a risk. Some people were joking that she would be the one opposing the wedding or coming in a white dress. We didn\u2019t know in what mindset she would come. \n\nFor the dinner, I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s quicker if I copy past my answer to another comment :\n\nYes ! There is another detail that I couldn\u2019t give because of the character limit : The wedding took place in a private reserve. Which means the gates close at 9pm. Our lodge had a max capacity of 10. So I was hosting with for 3 nights (for free) 8 guests (my mom and grandma included). But the other guests had to find their own accommodation. And to avoid being forced leaving early to make the gate, they needed to find accommodation inside the reserve.\n\nAnd it was tough because there isn\u2019t many.\n\nIn the end my mother in law did not find one and neither did my aunt. But at the last minute a cheap cute Airbnb got available and I was the one to find it. I talked about it and my aunt said she needed it or else she would not stay for the dinner at all. She said that it was because I didn\u2019t invite her partner, she didn\u2019t want to drive all the way out of the reserve alone in the dark so she would leave at 5pm max. Unless I give her the Airbnb I found (instead of giving it to my mother in law). I though it was a fair ask and sent it to her on the spot. And so she booked it.\n\nSo when she said that she never intended to stay for the dinner, it was another weird power move against me.\n\nMy mother in law would have loved that Airbnb but because I sent it to my aunt, she had to leave right after the dinner.", "No, that\u2019s just the classic \u201efuck around and find out\u201c. OPs aunt counted on OP bulging to the pressure of this exact scenario: once her family is there, they wouldn\u2019t be forced to leave and can attend the fun party of someone they don\u2019t know at a pricey location. \n\nOP did the only right thing: standing up for herself and showing her the door. To be honest her aunt should have been removed from the first day as well as soon as she showed up with her family. \n\nI cannot wrap my head around the audacity bringing people to a wedding _after explicitly being told not to by the bride_.", "No. Sorry but wrong. Her aunt was told her family could not attend the wedding as they didn't have the space. It doesn't matter who canceled. There could have been other reasons. She was told no. She did it anyway. THAT is why she wasn't invited. Because she wouldn't respect OP from the jump.", "As a host you have to consider your guests. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to have an understanding of the travel, time, and expense your asking of your guests. Wedding day or not. Your special day to you is just another wedding to everyone in attendance. It\u2019s really not that serious. The aunt should have behaved better here, but so could have the hosts.", "She is not alone, all her family was there. She often travels alone with my mom and my mom was there", "I kicked her out of the pool party as a response for forcing her family at my wedding dinner. I was upset and did not want to see them the next dat", "They didn\u2019t have to come all the way. They were not invited. They also made it a family trip and went to neighboring countries. Not coming to my wedding, a person they only saw once, wouldn\u2019t have impacted their trip.\n\nYour comment on my in laws not being happy to see me getting married to my husband is really mean though. You\u2019d like my aunt.", "No, they (the aunts family) shouldn\u2019t have flown the long way down there _because they weren\u2019t invited_. \n\nAlso it can hardly be called \u201ecoming alone\u201c if he aunts sister (the brides mother) is attending.", "You stay that the OP should have been classy and gracious however your response does not convey any of that.\n\nI have noticed lots of people on this sub advocate for kindness and good manners whilst showing none to the OP or people they disagree with.\nIt\u2019s important to practice what you preach.", "Oh yeah, you showed a lot of heart when you basically told her you don't give a fuck about her husband and little kid so much that you can't stand the idea of them eating in your presence.", "Your aunt definitely sounds annoying. But it seems like you knew that going in. Probably better to just let her leave and let her attend the pool party the next day and then go back to low contact. What was the harm in letting her attend the pool party?", "Thank you so much. You read the situation exactly as I do. They counted on the pressure and me not wanting to make a scandale to force their way into the wedding.\n\nI do feel upset with myself for not finding the courage to get them out on the wedding day. They stayed more than two hours and only left when they did because other guests got angry at them really.\n\nThank you again <3", "Exactly. This isn't petty. OP hadn't spoken to the aunt in 8 years. She got a free trip basically and had the balls to pull this shit?", "[deleted]", "What are you talking about? What you said is a given. Did you misunderstand my comment? OP told her aunt BEFORE arriving that she was not to bring anyone else and they wouldn\u2019t accommodated. The aunt didn\u2019t care about that and STILL showed up with her family. It would\u2019ve been different had OP not said anything beforehand and waited until the aunt\u2019s arrival. The aunt deliberately disregarded OP\u2019s wishes just because her sister was egging her on to do so. It\u2019s clear OP\u2019s mom and aunt didn\u2019t care what OP wanted simply because they\u2019re auntie and mama. \ud83d\ude44", "You mum and grandma are incredibly irritating and definitely AH for pressuring you and trying to bend your plans, you\u2019re valid in wanting your day to go as you want to. However, you handled it with grace and kissed them when you saw them but got angry when you found out she and her family are not staying, which was the initial issue, is it because you didn\u2019t want them there that badly that they couldn\u2019t even say hi considering you already agreed that they could come to the next event so surely you knew they were coming with her.. Did you want her to fly across the world completely alone, or did you not want them to even say hi at all so that was enough to revoke her invite to the next event. You said her family could come to the second event, so what\u2019s wrong with her sitting out on the dinner and coming back when she\u2019s allowed to with her family. You can\u2019t have it all so ESH", "Thank you", "I just was really upset and didn\u2019t want to see them there again. A petty revenge too I guess.", "The harm was she let her aunt know she can walk all over her. Other guests were able to follow the rules. Other guests lost their air bnb over the aunt who couldn't even respect OP. It's crazy to me how hard you're going for the aunt", "If I was invited to a no-kids wedding or party across the world, I wouldn\u2019t expect to be able to bring my kids as \u201cpayment\u201d for traveling all that way. Maybe I\u2019d make a vacation of it and bring my family on the trip, but I\u2019d never expect to bring them to the wedding/party. OP does not suck, but you do if you\u2019d expect to pull the same bullshit as her aunt.", "\"It was really expensive for them to crash your wedding, so you suck.\"", "Thank you", "Thank you <3", "Right? Like what?! \ud83d\ude2d"]}
