Cassie did need extra support, as she does have genuine issues with depression and anxiety. But they refused to compromise; It always came at my expense. The final straw was my high school graduation back in 2019. Cassie had a pageant at the same time. The plan was for both of our parents to attend the first half of Cassie\u2019s pageant, our mother would stay at Cassie\u2019s pageant, and our dad would leave to attend and record my graduation. Before Dad was about to leave, Cassie said she was having anxiety and needed them both there. He texted me to find my own ride home from graduation. I had been so hopefully that my parents would finally follow through with their promise to be there for me. In the honors sector class photo, I was the only student who didn\u2019t have any family members come. I felt awful. My mother, Dad, and Cassie were already home when I got back. They had ordered dinner and were celebrating Cassie\u2019s pageant, they didn\u2019t even seem to remember or care about me and my graduation. My parents tried to act friendly and congratulate me but I ignored them. My mother tried hugging me but I pushed past her. I decided then that I just couldn\u2019t depend on them not to disappoint me.\r  \n\r  \nMy graduation was three weeks ago. I didn\u2019t even bother reaching out to my mother, Dad, or Cassie. I gave my ceremony tickets to two friends and donated the rest. My mother and Dad reached out to me, saying they just learned about my ceremony through social media (neither of them went to college, so they assumed that the college got out at the same time as the local high schools.) They asked why I hadn\u2019t even asked them. I told them that they\u2019ve proven that I can\u2019t depend on them by always leaving me as a second thought to Cassie.

They know both sides of the story, but told me I was an asshole. They said how my parents felt so bad about my high school graduation, and that I was being selfish and denied my parents the chance to make it right and finally be able to put their guilt behind them.

Not even close, like not even a tiny bit. Why would you trust people who have consistently let you down and failed to celebrate your achievements?

Why did they celebrate her pageant (I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t the only one)? Why not wait for you? Why assume that college ended the same time as high school?

Your family failed you a second time by treating you badly AGAIN by allowing others to call you selfish and an asshole.  \n\nCongratulations on you achievements!", "INFO: If they were so committed to attend, why did they not inquire about graduation date(s), hotel options and your favorite local restaurant 3 months before to lock in these details.", "NTA in my opinion. Why would you invite them if they consistently showed you that your events are not a priority to them? I understand the need to give your sister extra support, but your parents should never have allowed that to make them neglect you. You don't owe them infinite chances- if and when you invite them to events is entirely up to you.", "It\u2019s not the same as graduation, but no one showed up to my high school baccalaureate.

You are practicing self care and sending a clear message; you did not support me so I'll walk my celebratory path without you. \n\nTheir excuse of thinking college schedules align with high school is a weak one. They likely understand final exams and if they wanted to support you they would be curious and take initiative to ask about your graduation. Can we pay for your regalia? \n\nI am truly sorry your needs, interests, successes where always secondary to your sister. You matter.

They would have been asking you what you wanted to do to celebrate, and making those arrangements.

You were protecting your heart from another disappointment. They knew you were graduating from university. It seems they didn\u2019t even ask about graduation and the plan.

I was harassed a month before I returned for senior year to book a restaurant for after graduation. When I showed up to give a campus tour in Sept, the President of my university handed me an envelope with a parking pass and other stuff for my dad. Graduation was up a big hill. This was all before October of senior year.\n\nI don\u2019t expect every parent to be like my dad.
