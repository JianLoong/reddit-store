The plan was for both of our parents to attend the first half of Cassie\u2019s pageant, our mother would stay at Cassie\u2019s pageant, and our dad would leave to attend and record my graduation. Before Dad was about to leave, Cassie said she was having anxiety and needed them both there. He texted me to find my own ride home from graduation. I had been so hopefully that my parents would finally follow through with their promise to be there for me. In the honors sector class photo, I was the only student who didn\u2019t have any family members come. I felt awful. My mother, Dad, and Cassie were already home when I got back. They had ordered dinner and were celebrating Cassie\u2019s pageant, they didn\u2019t even seem to remember or care about me and my graduation.
