They had ordered dinner and were celebrating Cassie\u2019s pageant, they didn\u2019t even seem to remember or care about me and my graduation.

So I don't blame you one bit.  The fact that they didn't go to college is no excuse for not knowing when your graduation was.  Didn't they know when college ended every year?  My parents didn't go to college either, and as their firstborn son, my college graduation was a very big deal, and I'm sure my parents knew the date very far in advance.  My father died of pancreatic cancer a little over a year after my graduation, and my mother told us after he died that the thing my father was most upset about was that he wouldn't get to see my younger brother's college graduation (he was finishing his freshman year at the time).  I got my master's degree a year after my father died, and my mother didn't drive and my brother didn't have a car yet, but I drove back from Albany to NY to bring them both up to Albany for the graduation and then drove them back after, and there was no way they weren't going to be there.

If you\u2019re going to pick and choose which child gets more love and affection just because one might need more help, why did you decide to have multiple kids in the first place. Every parent should be capable of giving each of their kids the support they need regardless if some of their kids might need more support.

My feelings are slightly mixed. I feel you on the history of being put second most of your life. They were 100% WRONG for not doing everything they could to make sure one of them was at your graduation. Being told to find your own ride home is shitty. Personally that would be burned in my brain. But I will also say, this must have been at least 4 years prior to your latest graduation. There is a degree of unfairness to deny your parents an option to go, especially when your sister probably didn\u2019t have a conflicting event this time. You had a somewhat traumatic experience of deep disappointment, and you didn\u2019t want to relive that. But it seems like you\u2019re ever-punishing them for circumstances that don\u2019t apply to this exact situation. I also see a lot of comments people saying THEIR parents had their graduation marked on their calendar, and that your parents should have made arrangements or asked long before. That is neither here nor there, some parents are oblivious to schooling events especially the more grown their children are. It\u2019s not necessarily great, but I think at least letting your family know your graduation was coming up would have given you the opportunity to see things for yourself. Rather than projecting your past disappointment. Let them know once, and let them do what they may with given notice. I don\u2019t believe your parents straight up didn\u2019t care, they simply didn\u2019t know. Not every parent thinks in the avenue of going the same extra mile as the next parent.

But we don\u2019t know what they would have done now and how they would have shown up for you. You denied them and yourself that possibility. But I 100% understand why. It\u2019s not your job to ease their guilt. Nor should you feel guilty about your decision. You say you were avoiding the disappointment. They feel shitty they didn\u2019t know this time around, and now they\u2019re being reminded of their past shiftiness to the same degree. You could have met them halfway, but they are the parents.

For what it's worth, this reddit stranger is so so proud of you.", "NTA.\n\nYour parents were heartbroken that you saw them as untrustworthy, not at the fact that they couldn\u2019t be there for you at such an important time in your life.\n\nThat says it all.", "NTA. \n\nGod your parents have not navigated this well. I have GAD, panic disorder, OCD. And honestly I suspect that your sister is full of shit and a little manipulative, but that\u2019s just a feeling. The larger issue is that your parents job was to help her function independently and set her up for success in the real world. In the real world, people won\u2019t drop major life events for Cassie and she needed to learn how to self soothe and cope independently. She shouldn\u2019t have felt entitled to ask for both your parents time during your major moment. And when she did, your parents should have laid the boundary - \u201cNo, Cassie. Dad has to leave now to attend OP\u2019s graduation. Mom can help you work through some breathing exercises if you\u2019re feeling anxious, but Dad will be leaving.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m so sorry your parents failed you so spectacularly.", "NTA. No way at all. Congratulations on graduating!! I\u2019m proud of you and you should be too.", "100% NTA - You did absolutely nothing wrong. Your parents were given many chances and failed each time, why would you give them another chance? Honestly it seems like their disappointment is more about trying to save face for other family members than genuine disappointment. If they had been truly interested in your graduation, it would\u2019ve taken them 30 seconds to go online and look up the date. Or only 5 seconds to send you a text and ask when it was so they can plan. They did nothing. They showed no interest in attending until it was too late. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nHere's the truth of the situation: Your parents aren't hurt because you didn't give them a chance or that you \"disregarded\" them. They're upset because they look like bad parents. Everyone now knows that A) you feel so let down by them that you didn't trust them to show up and B) they couldn't be bothered to find out when your graduation was before it was too late.", "NTA. Go NC with your family until you receive a full and public apology. The best thing you can do is to make a huge success of your life and surround yourself with people who actually care about you", "NTA, most parents would care enough to know it was approaching and asking you for a ticket BEFORE the event. Congrats on your graduation \ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf93", "NTA - Cassie didn't need both their support at the pagent.", "Absolutely NTA. You did the right thing. It was YOUR day to celebrate YOUR huge accomplishment and YOU got to make all the decisions.\n\nI'm so sorry this happened. But I'm glad you had some people there who supported you. Congratulations.", "NTA. Why is everyone making this about your parents\u2019 feelings? YOU were the one who was hurt. If they wanted to make it up to you, they could have done so already. They have had your entire life to prioritize you, and they didn\u2019t. Now it\u2019s too late, and they only have themselves to blame. THEY were heartbroken?! Boo-fucking-hoo", "NTA. And I'm sorry your parents let you down. I did a similar thing. My parents babied my sister and paid for everything she did, horses, college, cars, you name it. I got a job at 15 and I paid for my clothes, hobbies, haircuts and education etc. My Mum was horrible to me when I said I was going to university and tried to bully me into staying in my hometown and said it's a waste of time and money. I was the first person in my family to go to university. When it came to graduation I decided not to go at all - firstly I knew that my divorced parents and their partners would be difficult about who attended, they wouldn't go together and each student is only allowed 2 guests, and secondly I didn't feel that they should get to celebrate my degree when they could not have been less supportive. They were a bit shitty about it but I went to a festival instead with a group of friends and danced dusk til dawn covered in glitter. It was brilliant :)", "YTA. Graduation is about celebrating YOUR achievement, not mending their guilt. Besides, who needs that kind of negativity on their big day?", "N even remotely TA. OP, you have been dealing with this rejection and sidelining alone your entire life. Whatever you have achieved, you've done it without the support of your dreadful parents, so congratulations and very well done for that. What you have done is simply hold a mirror up to your parents and shown them their own actions. That is what they're pissed off about, that their actions have consequences and they haven't got away with treating you like shit all these years despite trying to kid themselves and everybody else that they have. They're learning the hard way that if you burn your arse you've got to sit on the blister. Very best of luck to you for your future, OP, I'm sure it's a very bright one.", "He texted me to find my own ride home from graduation.\n\nWHAT?! This is what got me and my heart hurt for your 17/ 18-year-old self that stood alone at your HS graduation, a significant right of passage.\n\nI am totally with you. Why in the world would you think they'd care about your college graduation?  They have shown little interest in your life or achievements and are now trying to save face. Don't be there for it.\n\nKeep doing you and surround yourself with people that lift you up.  Congratulations on your college graduation and all the best to you in your next adventure!\n\nNTA", "NTA. They\u2019ve had 4 years to make amends. They aren\u2019t sorry; they are embarrassed. The onus is on them to \"make things right\".", "I'm sorry but totally NTA. You didn't want to get hurt again. I myself suffer from depression and anxiety but if I did this to my younger sister I would totally understand this response! You did what you did after years of this behaviour.\n\nThey aren't upset with what you did. They don't want the chance to 'make things right'. They simply feel guilty because they realised they can't control you. You have your own life and mind that doesn't come second to anyone's.\n\nI love my family but I have done the same to my grandparents many times for similar reasons. You don't need that sort of negativity surrounding you. I just hope you're doing okay after all this \ud83e\udd70", "Additionally, it\u2019s not OP\u2019s job to \u201cgive them the opportunity to get past their guilt\u201d, they\u2019re supposed to seek those opportunities out. OP didn\u2019t know how bad they *apparently* get after missing your high school grad - why is that? I expect it\u2019s because they\u2019ve conveyed that they felt guilty at all. Did they apologise, did they express regret at having let their kid down? NTA", "Further, you'd have to suspect the pagents themselves are likely contributing to the sisters anxiety wtf. These parents sounds awful.", "So NTA then right?", "Now they did have to travel, but my mom looked up my college graduation and booked a hotel months in advance.  That information is all online.", "Exactly. Even if they did make assumptions about teh dates, what plans had they made for the dates they did expect? Had they booked flights, a restaurant? Since I'd expect it to be a fairly high demand time what with all the schools and college graduates being taken out at the same time. \n\nI doubt they did anything at all since they hadn't confirmed with OP or asked about tickets. So a firm NTA.", "Yeah this pisses me off as well", "I get what you are saying, but lots of people try to get past things like anxiety. They just need help", "As someone who struggles with both anxiety and depression, I\u2019m sorry but Cassie sounds manipulative and entitled. how she wanted both her parents there. It\u2019s always about Cassie", "My aunt actually pulled similar shit on my mom.  She showed up for a visit the day mom graduated from high school and her kids would be si sad if grandma and grandpa left (to be fair, absolutely on my grandparents too).\n\nMy mom was valedictorian and no one from her family showed.\n\nEdited to add:  for OP'S knowledge my aunt's shenanigans absolutely continued and extended to us kids.  My mom never had the guts to cut her off, but my siblings and I did.  Her own kids went LC with her too.", "I'm guessing, but I suspect \"F off and die\".", "This is absolutely absurd, I'm so sorry you were treated this way!", "Cassie was planning another anxiety emergency just before OP's graduation. If OP stays in contact she can expect her life events to be put off until 'next time, for sure'", "Ah yeah, that makes sense! Thank you!", "Good point, if they wanted to celebrate OP\u2019s HS graduation they could still have done something later. Instead they missed the ceremony and shrugged.", "Although it wasn't quite the same as graduation, nobody attended my high school baccalaureate. After the awards ceremony, my mother arrived at the dinner approximately 30 minutes late."]}
