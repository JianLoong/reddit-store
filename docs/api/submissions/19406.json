Before Dad was about to leave, Cassie said she was having anxiety and needed them both there. He texted me to find my own ride home from graduation. I had been so hopefully that my parents would finally follow through with their promise to be there for me. In the honors sector class photo, I was the only student who didn\u2019t have any family members come. I felt awful. My mother, Dad, and Cassie were already home when I got back. They had ordered dinner and were celebrating Cassie\u2019s pageant, they didn\u2019t even seem to remember or care about me and my graduation.
