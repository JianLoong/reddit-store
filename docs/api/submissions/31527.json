No college is going to reschedule exams because your brother had a baby lol. \n\nHow out of touch", "NTA. College instructor here. There is no way I\u2019d let you reschedule an exam in my class because your niece was being born. It\u2019s just your niece. This is college, not middle school.\n\nShow this to your family.", "NTA -  do people realise that colleges don't just reschedule exams on the whim of a student??  Also most people I know didn't want their entire extended family crawling all over them in the first days after having a newborn.   They will get over it!", "NTA. It's not normal to skip exams to be a peripheral guest when someone is having a baby, especially when the new mother doesn't even like you. I can't believe (I mean, I believe you!) that your parents prioritize this over your success in college. Plus, first babies can be particularly unpredictable and slow to arrive.", "NTA - Poor mama. Labor, delivery and a pack of in-laws descending all in one day.", "WTH would you be there? The only necessary attendees were mom and baby. Everyone else is superfluous. Unless you want your dad, mom, brother, cousins, etc staring at your crotch, I recommend moving far away before you have kids. Or just don't tell them you're pregnant and avoid them for 8+ months.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your family is being weird. College is more important than seeing your niece immediately after being born.", "NTA - your family may be trying to normalize this messed up situation by pretending everything is all story-book perfection, which would include the whole family being in the hospital and it's everyone's first priority.  They want to make themselves feel better and 'wanted' a big perfect birth. \n\nYour parents and family need to chill. You do you.", "Nta.  A newborn baby does not need to meet the entire family immediately.   It's flu and covid season and keeping visitors to a minimum is best.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your kid.", "What, are supposed to be there to pull the baby from the birth canal? Oh, hell no, you are five hours away and it\u2019s exams week. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to be there. You can contribute nothing. You came home and saw the baby on day three. That should be sufficient. NTA", "What the actual fuck?  They are out of their fucking minds. I also question whether someone who literally just gave birth WANTS her entire extended family to visit on THE DAY she gave birth.\n\nNTA at all.", "Rescheduling exams can be a pain in the ass, if it is possible at all (sometimes it just isn't). \n\nNot being there day of is totally fine, esp since you saw her in the same week anyway, so what does it matter", "NTA. You weren't even invited by your niece's mother to be there that soon.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you reschedule exams, can you even reschedule them.\n\nyour brother isn't even with the woman. Your family sounds messed up not you.\n\nHope your exams went well", "NTA, too many people on the day of birth is not good.", "NTA. Your family are idiots. You can\u2019t schedule exams. They\u2019re schedule by the teachers/school so you not going would mean failing. You saw her when she was three days oldC as soon As you could. That\u2019s enough", "Oh, the drama! How ever will you go on knowing you missed the first 72 hours of her life? How dare you prioritize education over seeing the birth of the 10000000000000000000th baby in the world!

Like why would you need to be there on the day the baby was born?", "What did they expect you to do exactly IF you were there???", "NTA. \n\nAnd no professor is going to let you reschedule finals (if they\u2019re finals) because your brother is having a kid. \n\nYour family is delusional. You\u2019re fine.", "NTA. Childbirth is not a spectator sport, even if your family still thinks it is.", "NTA. If I were your niece\u2019s mama, I\u2019d be damned grateful *someone* in your family didn\u2019t act entitled to be present that day.", "NTA. Making that kind of effort for the week of their birth is plenty enough. They need to pull their heads out of their asses and celebrate the long term decisions you\u2019re making for your future. Sounds like many of them have never taken a college level exam because you can\u2019t just \u201creschedule\u201d so easily.", "Day three? That was fast! \n\nWhen I had my first, the only ones who had seen her at 3 days old were the parents and grandparents. Everybody else got photos.", "NTA. Your niece doesn\u2019t give a shit anyway. This is just adult histrionics. Don\u2019t give it another thought. Congratulations on making it through exam week!", "They're being ridiculous. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Even if you were all close, that\u2019s a very quick response time. Most people wouldn\u2019t want much visiting with a newborn for the first 2 weeks.", "BIRTH IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT.\n\nI don't care if you missed it because you had a coffee date or just wanted to sleep in. If you are not the patient or the patient's support person, there's no reason to be there. In fact, a lot of L&D nurses have horror stories of too many people in the delivery room and how that created a bad situation.  \n\nYou're NTA. Tell your family it's really messed up that they wanted to act like this is a social event instead of letting your niece's mom have peace and privacy.", "NTA.  What are you supposed to have done while the kid was being born...are you in med school? They are being ridiculous and you should ignore them.", "NTA my sister actually recently brought up the fact that I wasn't there when her first child was born (nearly 40 years ago). I was at college and NOBODY called me and told me for 2 days! She was born in mid-december I saw her at Christmas.", "NTA: I was there the day my sister had her first baby, and it was the wrong move. Waiting around in the waiting room and descending on a new mother minutes after the baby is born is rarely what the new mother actually wants. Some do, but I think it's probably rare.  \nNone of my siblings met any of my kids until a week after they were born at least. My Mom is the only one I wanted around that day, and that was mostly to help with my older kids.", "NTA\n\nI have never heard of rescheduling exams in school.  This is not like a test that is offered multiple times a year or something done by appointment.  Heck if it were even my own siblings in such a situation I would simply say congratulations, but I can not leave during exams. Your family is delusional.", "NTA. Your attendance was not required.", "NTA. I lived less than an hour away from my sister both times she gave birth and I was never there nor was I expected to be, nor did I want to be. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but there's no expectation that you NEED to be there for the birth of a niece/newphew.", "NTA - those are ridiculous asks. You are a college student. Unless you are ill or in the hospital, you take tests when they are scheduled.\n\nAnd honestly, the only person who should be at the hospital is the Dad and maybe Mom's mom or selected person.\n\nThere was no role for you except sit in a waiting room for hours on end.", "Nta. Of all my niblings (one boy and 5 girls), I was only present for the day of my nephew's birth and that was sheer luck it ended up being on two of my days off (it was a 24 hour labor). For the rest of them I made it down as soon as I could. I am close with my siblings and their spouses but no one had the gall to call me names for not being there\n\nMight be because I moved to another state shortly after my nephew was born and getting back home for the girls required more than a quick trip to the neighboring city. \n\nHeck my dad only showed up after they were born because he couldn't get off work and no one blamed him.", "NTA - I\u2019m guessing baby mama was thrilled you weren\u2019t there. Your family is obnoxious horning in on a very private personal day. I didn\u2019t even want my OWN family at the hospital the day I gave birth. In laws were out of the question.", "No, not a big deal. I bet you're the only one thr baby mama was happy with. Good chance she wanted everyone else to screw off and leave her alone.", "Sounds like your family just want you to buckle under and do as you are told. Regardless of your own responsibilities. \n\nRemind them that giving birth is not a spectator sport and I\u2019m sure the mom didn\u2019t want any of he ex\u2019s family invading her privacy in the first place.", "NTA\n\nChildbirth is not a spectator event.  The pregnant person didn\u2019t need all the people hanging out, especially people she is not related to.  \n\nYou did what you needed to do, stayed at school. You made the adult decision.  Everyone who is telling you that you needed to punt your exams and be there for your brother\u2019s baby mama is nuts.", "Eyeroll...\nNTA", "Thank you.  Honestly described my family perfectly.  I feel like an alien in this family because everyone is super entitled ans just\u2026. I don\u2019t know narcissistic here.", "Have any of them gone to college?", "My dh grad prof didn\u2019t want to reschedule for our own kid\u2019s birth.", "Lol yeah my brother is like the golden child even though he is drunk and high everyday.  I\u2019ve always been the maid in the family.  Doing all the laundry, dishes, everything.  If my brother didn\u2019t want to do his share, i was forced to.  \n\nAlso my brother dropped out of college after the first semester sooo.  I guess no one cares", "Honestly.  Super hard debating leaving to move across the US.  I bought a camper, but I\u2019m still saving up for a truck to haul it.", "NTA what a strange thing to expect you to turn up to.", "And apparently never went to college! What were you gonna tell your professors\u2026Hey, I really need to reschedule my exams because my brother\u2019s baby momma is giving birth! I\u2019m sure they would be fine with that\u2026Not! \nNTA", "That is pretty harsh - but I laughed. Sorry. maybe. oops ;)", "Ahh, so the problem is you weren\u2019t there to change her first diapers.", ">my brother is like the golden child\n\nSo I guess you're already backing out of the forced, unpaid babysitting job? ;)", "NTA and you need to just prioritize yourself and your education. So later on, when you have a solid career and your own life, when everyone wants you to support your brother or your \"niece that you will probably never see\" you can say \"Sorry, I have obligations, I spent my time taking care of everyone and everything when I was younger, so sorry\". \ud83d\ude01"]}
