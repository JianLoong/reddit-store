I was told that my (male) boss was \"tired of you girls not being able to take a joke.\" I was the third victim of his harassment and was told it was easier to fill my role if I quit like the others did than it was to fill the creep's role if he fired him. The creep eventually creeped on the wrong woman (someone harder to replace than him) and he was fired. He came back that afternoon and slashed my car tire and the other woman's. \n\nSo many women have stories of reporting this shit and having it backfire. There's a good chance she's scared of the backlash, of being told she's overreacting or that she's egotistical for thinking he's attracted to her.", "She wants you to say, \"That's messed up babe. I love you and can't believe this is happening. I trust you will find the way to deal with this\"", "NAH\n\nI think you have her best interests at heart and that's great. On the flip side I can see how this is a hard call for her. Women who report things like this to HR don't always get a positive outcome. I agree with you that she should, but I can see why it would make her anxious", "Yea.  YTA for getting mad at her.  It's hard navigating unwanted attention in the workplace.  A lot of people will still label women as sensitive complainers.  He has been there longer than her and he probably won't get fired so she will have to keep dealing with him and he will be salty and mad.  \n\nWhat she may want to do is talk to some other female coworkers and get their take or some strategies from them.  For sure this isn't the first time he has behaved this way and they may know the best strategy.", "I recently had to quit my job due to harassment that I reported. He still works there harassing others. They are giving him yet another chance. I couldn't cope so I left. \n\nShe should report him, but I would lower your expectations about a resolution. She needs to do this when she is comfortable. \n\nWorking at a place where people know you reported someone is not always great. Even if they reprimand the harasser things may still not be good. \n\nNAH", "Reported a number of men who had harassed me. It was a group effort because they Said they'd see who would get me (I was engaged at the time). Got told off by HR and said many would kill for my job so I can go.", "NAH with caveats- you\u2019re under the impressions that A) positive things happen for women when women push back when men sexually harass them and B) your wife wants your suggestions. Ask her questions, listen to her. Has she had to deal with this in the past? What happened? \nMen typically have not had to deal with this shit so do not understand the very real, very scary consequences of not handling these situations \u201ccorrectly\u201d. I put correctly in quotes because there is never a \u201ccorrect\u201d way as we never know how the man will react and we are almost invariably blamed for not doing the \u201ccorrect\u201d thing; which is the territory you are creeping into. I\u2019ve had a friend punched in the face for simply saying \u201cnot interested\u201d when asked for their number, another followed home when ignoring the same request\u2026 we simply do not know what bullshit consequence in the consequence lottery we will get when we are forced in to these circumstances against our will by men. So the least you can do is just give her a safe, soft place to vent and feel heard. It\u2019s probably scary and frustrating for you to know your loved one is experiencing this, think of how it is for her and just support her by listening.", "YTA.\n\n1) HR is there to protect the company & they will do so, possibly not in your wife's best interest \n\n2) Talking to the person doing it can also be problematic. Men who are willing to flirt with a married coworker are not always the sort who take kindly to being asked to stop. Chances are at least 50/50 that he would actively make things worse.\n\n3) reporting him might cause problems for her career  because it makes her a 'troublemaker'\n\nIt may well be that he won't stick around long. If it looks like he's settling in, getting promoted, etc. and your wife doesn't want to deal.with, she may need to look for another job.\n\nStop pushing her. Maybe she can tell you why she can't easily deal with it. Maybe she doesn't completely have a well articulated reason, just a feeling. \n\nBut either way, you won't help by nagging her.", "She doesn\u2019t want to be murdered.

I'm HR adjacent (I'm a program manager and deal with HR issues just about daily).  She needs to document the dates/times, locations, and any witnesses to what is being said and then go to HR.  She should not confront the person directly.  HR will deal with it.  Companies have sexual harassment training for a reason and it's not a \"how to\" manual, but a \"do not do\" series.", "Nah. She\u2019s worried about creating a toxic work environment and or getting in trouble for reporting it. It\u2019s a real thing that happens all the time. It\u2019s not okay, but I get why she\u2019s apprehensive. Take time and really listen to her reasonings. Give her space to work this out in her own time. You\u2019re not an ah for wanting her to confront him, but she\u2019s not an ah either.", "NAH, I get your frustration, but it's no secret that there's a lot of shitty workplaces out there that shut down or even punish workers for bringing up harassment in or out of the team. She definitely knows she CAN do that, but she's wondering if she SHOULD because things can turn out really badly.", "NTA. People who constantly complain about their predicament and ado absolutely nothing to change are tiring as hell.", "NTA. She needs to speak up and you're encouraging just that. If she's that upset, she shouldn't be cowering in fear. I've had to report harassment before and no, it's not easy, but it is necessary. She's being way too passive about this serious matter. \n\nAnd before anyone asks, yes I\u2019m a woman. Even if speaking up doesn't make a difference, keeping your mouth shut is worse. It's enabling this person to do this to other people when it should be nipped in the bud.", "NTA. \n\nIf she\u2019s not going to stand up for herself and deal with this problem (either personally or going through HR or her manager) then she has no room to complain.", "NTA. It's appropriate to tell him to stop, that she's married and he needs to end the sexual harassment. Make note of date, time and what wa said, then if it continues go to HR.\n\nHe needs to be told to lay off before it's sexual harassment.", "NTA\n\nPeople being vague, or refusing to either deal with a problem or stop complaining about it after a certain point are maddening.", "Thing is she isn't ready to manage as you suggest. And you being strident might even feel like you're pressuring her in her opinion?\n\nThe next step might be to tell her that you support her and look forward to her feeling empowered by actually managing this difficulty. \"I'm here for you honey. Let me know what you want to do, OK? I'll cross that bridge with you when you reach it.\"\n\nNTA. Inaction isn't my hallmark either. But, she seems to need you on her side and she *feels* you're judging her as failing this time? She won't thank you for that.", "If she\u2019s \u201cgetting upset\u201d at his comments but isn\u2019t taking the necessary actions to get him to stop making those comments, how upset is she really?

Unfortunately it's not easy as a Ekman to report such things as there can do frequently be victim blaming, retribution and other unpleasantness.  Have others seen it? What has your wife said about this aspect of the problem?", "Nope.  She needs to be straight with you as well.  Explicitly state why she cannot do this.", "YTA for not having a word with the creep yourself..", "NTA\n\nYour wife must be afraid of this guy to constantly be making excuses for his shitty behavior which is even more of a reason for you to tell her she isn't doing enough to confront him.\n\nIf you are able to, start picking her up from work.

Remember that HR is there to protect the company, not the employee. & Please, please don\u2019t get angry with your wife.

I had a dude almost stalking me at work while I was forced to work offset breaks on a machine so it got its full runtime, without any downtime at all.

It creeped me TF out. I'm nonconfrontational and turned to my coworkers to help keep an eye on him for me for eye witnesses to any weird behavior while asking supervisors for permission for one of my male coworkers to take his breaks with me. I told our HR rep and basically got told, \"You have to handle it first and tell him to stop.\"\n\nCue two weeks later, I'm packing a box which requires me to be bent over. The man came up behind me and pretended to smack me on the ass, but didn't actually touch me.
