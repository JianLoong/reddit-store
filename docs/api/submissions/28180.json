The creep eventually creeped on the wrong woman (someone harder to replace than him) and he was fired. He came back that afternoon and slashed my car tire and the other woman's. \n\nSo many women have stories of reporting this shit and having it backfire.

I put correctly in quotes because there is never a \u201ccorrect\u201d way as we never know how the man will react and we are almost invariably blamed for not doing the \u201ccorrect\u201d thing; which is the territory you are creeping into.

You just don't know how that particular man will react to a woman - someone he perhaps views as inferior to him - telling him no. Will he become violent, threatening? Will he try to undermine her at work if she says no to him? Sadly, many men do behave like this and as a woman it's sometimes easier - albeit so wrong - to smile and nod and just pretend like you're okay because the alternative of actually doing something could have far worse ramifications. \n\nThe fact that this man has the balls to openly misogynistically objectify her as 'thing' (as he does when he says 'the view from my desk', a statement which suggests that, to him, she's not a person at all but an object for him to enjoy) would leave me fearful, if I were in your wife's shoes, that he might react horribly to at an attempt to call him out in his behaviour.", "YTA for getting \"pretty upset\" with her. That's not helping anything. The situation she's dealing with at work is pretty stressful and now you're compounding it by making yourself the victim for having to hear about her issue. \n\nDirect confrontation isn't always the best option. If her gut is telling her not to directly confront him, trust her instinct on that. She has 30 years of experience evaluating which men are a potential threat. You don't. \n\nGoing to HR might be a good option, but it depends on the company. Sometimes the complaints lead to company action against the aggressor. Sometimes the complaints lead to the one complaining getting fired. \n\nYou say she's making excuses, but you don't list her counterpoints here, which tells me you're dismissive of her reasons. You clearly don't trust her version of events and her reasoning. This isn't how a supportive partner acts.", "YTA but you probably meant well. \n\nMy good friend had an older coworker try to flirt / get with her because she was nice to him. She was married with kids (so was he, and older, didn\u2019t stop him). He started stalking her outside of work, showing up at places he figured she would be. You know what they did when she reported it? Forced her into \u201cmediation\u201d with her stalker. Played right into what he wanted - time with her. She had to sit in a room with him and HR where he got to talk all about how he felt she was suddenly \u201cmean and cold\u201d to him and those feelings were validated by HR. She left the job and he still stalked her. Years later, she\u2019s taking her new baby to daycare and guess who is picking up his grandchild from the same daycare? Same guy, but that was probably a coincidence. But he started yelling at her \u201cwhy did you leave me / block me you bitch!\u201d on and on and on in front of the children. Guess who now has to find a new daycare for her baby?\n\nSo yeah\u2026 reporting men who are sexually harassing you at work is NOT a ticket to making it stop.

Reporting to HR may not be the saving grace you think it will be, because HR usually acts in the company\u2019s best interest rather in the employee\u2019s, and depending on who this guy is, they may go after her for reporting it.

It took me a while to ACCEPT that he had to deal with it in his own way and that his personality, perspective, approach to problem-solving, ability to deal with conflict, patience, etc. - they were all different than mine.)\n5. There are people who complain about a negative situation and do nothing else. That may or may not be your spouse.

It may or may not work.\n6. She may also just want to vent to you and get support from you, but you are legitimately tired of hearing the same old story and having to provide the same old soothing words every day. You can discuss that with her. Maybe you tell her that you think it would be better if she discuss with a counselor who may be more skilled at helping her deal with the work situation. Maybe you two work out some agreement that sets some parameters for discussing this - so that she has some outlet and support, but you are not just a non-playing-character that she gets to dump all HER frustrations onto while you can't do/say anything about it.\n7. Sometimes, there are weird emotional dynamics at play. E.g., She may feel a bit helpless at work. She comes home and feels that you are throwing things at her, and THAT makes her feel more helpless because she's not in control anywhere.\n\nThere are so many ways this could be playing out. Very hard for the two of you to see your own motivations and discern where one of you is expecting too much of the other and not enough of yourself.

We understand that. \n\nWhat we don't understand is how you can sit there and say, \"just go to hr, it's your own fault if you do nothing\". \n\nThe choices are, say something and risk losing your job, or do nothing and endure the harassment. Your solution to do something also carries issues which could result at best, being labelled at your workplace, keeping your job while being uncomfortable or at worst being murdered.", "Apparently we made a big circle from feminist empowerment to keep quite to keep a job and not get murdered. \n\nI don\u2019t understand these people.", "what do you not see here??? No she doesn't have to sit still and take it that's why we are coming up with alternatives ANYTHING BUT GOING TO HR. because if she does the harassment and hypocrisy she'll face will be even worse", "If the alternative is being harassed at work every day, yeah.", "No. And I live in Europe. Is that a problem? \n\nDo new mum get a lot of harassment in the US for some reason?", "I was also sexually assaulted at the same job.

I don't know about you, but I feel worse watching a loved one suffer, than I do about my own problems. \n\nUnfortunately, the post is fairly light on details; but I agree with you, if he's just taking his frustrations out on her without trying to understand why she can't do what he suggests, then he's the AH. But, if she's just saying, \"No I can't do that!\" without coming up with her own solutions, then she's the AH as well. To herself, and to him.\n\nESH.", "Yes. I literally said I don\u2019t have a solution for her.  \nI said her partner should show support instead of calling her annoying. That is the point of this sub. Someone supplies a scenario and asks if they messed up. I said he messed up. \nReading what I said and concluding that I think that is hilarious. Because I said she might not have the confidence to speak up, I automatically must want her to be harassed? What kind of logic is that? You\u2019re purposely misinterpreting what I said and making wild claims to try to support your stance.  \n\nAlso, you don\u2019t have her back. You are accusatory throughout all of these comments. That is not having her back.", "Society will be able to change when those with the confidence to speak up do so and those that are the perpetrators are called out by others and held accountable by society.  \nHow do I know? Because it has already changed, just not enough yet.

It's the people who sit back, who know it's wrong but refuse to intervene because of the fallout it might cause them. \n\nIt's the husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons, colleagues, to not call the victim annoying and stand up and say something on their behalf. \n\nSitting on a forum and blaming the wife for not doing enough is part of the problem.", "The Us has significantly less protections for employees than Europe. And coming off maternity leave is a weak position to be in. Maternity leave generally means someone can\u2019t get fired but once they are back they can be.
