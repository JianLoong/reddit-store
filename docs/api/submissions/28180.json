I was told that my (male) boss was \"tired of you girls not being able to take a joke.\" I was the third victim of his harassment and was told it was easier to fill my role if I quit like the others did than it was to fill the creep's role if he fired him. The creep eventually creeped on the wrong woman (someone harder to replace than him) and he was fired. He came back that afternoon and slashed my car tire and the other woman's. \n\nSo many women have stories of reporting this shit and having it backfire. There's a good chance she's scared of the backlash, of being told she's overreacting or that she's egotistical for thinking he's attracted to her.\n\nEdited to add a judgement: NAH. Your wife has reasons for not reporting it, and unless you've been harassed it's genuinely hard to understand those reasons. \n\nWhen I was in this situation my husband (then fianc\u00e9) was ready to storm the gates and drag this POS out to the street. I understand that instinct. You're not an asshole for thinking the system would/should be there to protect people from this kind of thing. But you can see from the various stories below that many of us have tried to \"do the right thing\" and had it backfire. \n\nSo the workplace creep is the AH, the system is the AH, the general feeling of \"am I ready to go through an ugly process where I'll be doubted and possibly retaliated against?\" is the AH.

A lot of people will still label women as sensitive complainers.  He has been there longer than her and he probably won't get fired so she will have to keep dealing with him and he will be salty and mad.  \n\nWhat she may want to do is talk to some other female coworkers and get their take or some strategies from them.  For sure this isn't the first time he has behaved this way and they may know the best strategy.", "I recently had to quit my job due to harassment that I reported. He still works there harassing others. They are giving him yet another chance. I couldn't cope so I left. \n\nShe should report him, but I would lower your expectations about a resolution.

Ask her questions, listen to her. Has she had to deal with this in the past? What happened? \nMen typically have not had to deal with this shit so do not understand the very real, very scary consequences of not handling these situations \u201ccorrectly\u201d. I put correctly in quotes because there is never a \u201ccorrect\u201d way as we never know how the man will react and we are almost invariably blamed for not doing the \u201ccorrect\u201d thing; which is the territory you are creeping into. I\u2019ve had a friend punched in the face for simply saying \u201cnot interested\u201d when asked for their number, another followed home when ignoring the same request\u2026 we simply do not know what bullshit consequence in the consequence lottery we will get when we are forced in to these circumstances against our will by men.

Chances are at least 50/50 that he would actively make things worse.\n\n3) reporting him might cause problems for her career  because it makes her a 'troublemaker'\n\nIt may well be that he won't stick around long. If it looks like he's settling in, getting promoted, etc. and your wife doesn't want to deal.with, she may need to look for another job.\n\nStop pushing her.

You just don't know how that particular man will react to a woman - someone he perhaps views as inferior to him - telling him no. Will he become violent, threatening? Will he try to undermine her at work if she says no to him? Sadly, many men do behave like this and as a woman it's sometimes easier - albeit so wrong - to smile and nod and just pretend like you're okay because the alternative of actually doing something could have far worse ramifications. \n\nThe fact that this man has the balls to openly misogynistically objectify her as 'thing' (as he does when he says 'the view from my desk', a statement which suggests that, to him, she's not a person at all but an object for him to enjoy) would leave me fearful, if I were in your wife's shoes, that he might react horribly to at an attempt to call him out in his behaviour.", "YTA for getting \"pretty upset\" with her. That's not helping anything. The situation she's dealing with at work is pretty stressful and now you're compounding it by making yourself the victim for having to hear about her issue. \n\nDirect confrontation isn't always the best option. If her gut is telling her not to directly confront him, trust her instinct on that. She has 30 years of experience evaluating which men are a potential threat. You don't. \n\nGoing to HR might be a good option, but it depends on the company. Sometimes the complaints lead to company action against the aggressor. Sometimes the complaints lead to the one complaining getting fired. \n\nYou say she's making excuses, but you don't list her counterpoints here, which tells me you're dismissive of her reasons. You clearly don't trust her version of events and her reasoning.

She was married with kids (so was he, and older, didn\u2019t stop him). He started stalking her outside of work, showing up at places he figured she would be. You know what they did when she reported it? Forced her into \u201cmediation\u201d with her stalker. Played right into what he wanted - time with her. She had to sit in a room with him and HR where he got to talk all about how he felt she was suddenly \u201cmean and cold\u201d to him and those feelings were validated by HR. She left the job and he still stalked her. Years later, she\u2019s taking her new baby to daycare and guess who is picking up his grandchild from the same daycare?

You also don\u2019t mention if this person is her superior or an important figure in the company. Reporting to HR may not be the saving grace you think it will be, because HR usually acts in the company\u2019s best interest rather in the employee\u2019s, and depending on who this guy is, they may go after her for reporting it.

I started a new job recently and on my first day the VP got my number from our employee directory and started texting me.

Him and the CEO are best friends so I can\u2019t even make a report because I would be the one who gets screwed over. I just ignored him and it fizzled out over time. At my last job, my direct report was the CEO/owner and he did the same stuff and would make comments to my face all the time. \u201cI like your hair curled\u201d \u201cyou look pretty today\u201d \u201cI like your outfit\u201d etc and again, there wasn\u2019t much I could do.

It took me a while to ACCEPT that he had to deal with it in his own way and that his personality, perspective, approach to problem-solving, ability to deal with conflict, patience, etc. - they were all different than mine.)\n5. There are people who complain about a negative situation and do nothing else. That may or may not be your spouse.

It may or may not work.\n6. She may also just want to vent to you and get support from you, but you are legitimately tired of hearing the same old story and having to provide the same old soothing words every day. You can discuss that with her. Maybe you tell her that you think it would be better if she discuss with a counselor who may be more skilled at helping her deal with the work situation. Maybe you two work out some agreement that sets some parameters for discussing this - so that she has some outlet and support, but you are not just a non-playing-character that she gets to dump all HER frustrations onto while you can't do/say anything about it.\n7. Sometimes, there are weird emotional dynamics at play. E.g., She may feel a bit helpless at work. She comes home and feels that you are throwing things at her, and THAT makes her feel more helpless because she's not in control anywhere.\n\nThere are so many ways this could be playing out. Very hard for the two of you to see your own motivations and discern where one of you is expecting too much of the other and not enough of yourself.

I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.\n\nI'm tagging onto your comment with my own experience, just so people can see that this is a common occurrence. I was in a grocery store getting a snack one day with my friends (so, a group of 4 girls, 16-18 years old). An older guy came over and started hitting on me while we were browsing. It made me uncomfortable, especially in front of my friends, and because he was older, so I tried to politely excuse myself. He wouldn't leave me alone, no matter how much I tried to be nice, he wouldn't get it. I finally snapped and told him \"You need to leave me alone right now.\"\n\nHe got into his truck and waited for my friends and I to check out (we continued shopping for like 15 more minutes), chased us to my car, and started revving his engine at us. We felt super unsafe and tried just driving away. He chased us out of the parking lot and onto the highway. He kept speeding and trying to get up next to our windows. I had to keep slamming on the breaks to make sure he couldn't line up beside us (we were afraid he was trying to shoot us, Murica). We kept trying to lose him and he just kept running redlights and stop signs trying to keep up. We were on the phone with police for 10 horrifying minutes trying to direct them towards us. They finally pulled him over and said they'd have a \"talk\" with him. That's it. He didn't even get in trouble.\n\nEven when you try to be nice, you never know how someone is going to react.", "He gave you his number after physically assaulting you?

They should absolutely be called out when they make an uninformed statement.  Stop that shit right in it's tracks.  But when you say someone can't do something you're refusing the possibility that they ever could.  *YOU* cannot understand what someone else can understand, because in your mind you're limiting your comprehension for what someone else can comprehend.  To state \"you'll never understand\" is stating no one will ever understand because you're saying it's a paradox, something that cannot be understood, even by yourself.\n\nThis is a deep rooted societal issue, where it's socially acceptable to say \"You're never understand\" creating a situation that, as long as you believe this, can never be fixed because you refuse to let people to be part of the solution.  How are we going to better our society if people are flat out told \"Well, you didn't experience it, so you can't help, I'm the only one who can solve this, even though I don't have the power to alone.\"\n\n\"You'll never experience this exact specific situation with this exact specific level of detail\" does not equal \"you are not capable of understanding it.\"  Many people are capable of understanding right and wrong without actually doing right or wrong actions.  Just because you have not taken the time to understand the plights of others people who have uniquely different circumstances to deal with does not equate to the inability of others to understand them.  You are absolutely confusing \"experiencing\" something and \"understanding\" it.\n\nThe crux of the issue isn't that he can never understand.  The crux of the issue isn't even that he can empathize.  The crux of the issue is that people suck and what works for one person does not equate what works for someone else and the *husband didn't realize* that what may be a solution for him isn't necessarily a solution for her.  It had nothing to do with his in ability to understand.  **It had to do with his lack of realization of the reality of the situation.**  And that can be fixed, and is likely being fixed by his going on this subreddit in the first place, asking whether he's the asshole or not.\n\nBy your claim, you can never understand NotTodayPsycho's comment because you haven't had your coworker whom you confronted have his hand around your neck against a fridge.\n\nIt doesn't take a different species of brain to understand how incredibly fucked up, wrong, gut-wrenching, demoralizing, unsafe, violated, vulnerable and utterly helpless of a situation that is, possibly even leading to suicidal thoughts.

While it can take time, it would take no money.  The attorneys representing employees in a lawsuit against their current or former employer work on contingency, and are not paid hourly.
