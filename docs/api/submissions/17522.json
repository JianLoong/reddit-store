I am recently-ish divorced from my husband (29M) after being separated for a long time. Together my ex and I share a 2-year-old son. Everything between my ex and I has been very civil. The divorce was mutual and amicable. We don\u2019t have any sort of legal custody agreement because we don\u2019t need one. We get along very well and have no reason to not get along. Our marriage simply did not work out. We co-parent very well and have a very healthy relationship in that aspect. \n\nHowever, recently my partner and I moved into an apartment together. One day when my partner was gone, my ex came up into the apartment to help me gather our son\u2019s belongings and carry him down the stairs (we live in an upstairs apartment) and he left. After I told my partner that he had come into the apartment he went on about how that made him extremely uncomfortable. I told him that I couldn\u2019t do it all by myself so he had just helped me. And he just added that he doesn\u2019t find it appropriate that \u201canother man\u201d was in our apartment alone with me. \n\nToday it happened again, partner was gone, ex came by to pick up our son, I needed helped so he came upstairs into the apartment. Picked up our son and left. My partner called me and asked how my day was and I told him that ex just picked my son up and he asked if he came into the apartment. I said yes because I needed help. He again told me that it\u2019s not appropriate, as it\u2019s his space too and that I\u2019m crossing a boundary that he set a while ago. But I feel like since it\u2019s a space that my son lives in, my ex has a right to come in and help me with him. Especially if I ask. Because it\u2019s his son too.
