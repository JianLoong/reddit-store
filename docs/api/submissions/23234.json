Your daughter deserved to know the truth so she would know that she is 100% not at fault. It's a shame that Anna is allowing her vindictive pettiness destroy the friendship of two kids that had nothing to do with what is angering her.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter deserved to know it wasn't her fault and that she didn't do anything wrong. Telling her the truth was the best way to accomplish that. \n\nAlso, Anna is gross.", "NTA. Kids are people. They aren\u2019t dumb. They\u2019re a little immature, impulsive, and don\u2019t know how to regulate and take care of themselves alone but they are perfectly capable of understanding these kinds of things at least enough to comfort them. Kids being kept in the dark will just confuse them more than if you just answer their questions.", "NTA. Adults are quick to think children are too young to understand the things they go through, but I think it's better to tell. Otherwise she'll probably make up reasons for herself and think it's something she did", "NTA wow Anna is more immature than the actual children.", "NTA your kid is old enough to understand. In situations like this is more about the how you explain rather then what you\u2019re explaining. Ana is the real childish AH here. Your kids are just collateral damage unfortunately. Hopefully you teach your kid and remind her to stay kind. This isn\u2019t her friends fault either.\n\nEdit wrong judgement", "NTA I agree your daughter needs to know and you are actually doing her a disservice by hiding it from her.", "NTA\n\n It wasn't your decision to stop their friendship. And you're right, it's better for her to know this than to blame herself. \n\n>if my daughter relays the message to her ex friend and she tells her mom who obviously doesn\u2019t want her daughter to know why\n\n That sounds like it's Anna's problem, not yours. Just block her and be done with her.", "NTA. It's obvious that Anna's a very immature person, and you're right, she should never have brought the children into this matter, as they have nothing to do with the problem, which was already very ridiculous to begin with. Also, it was Anna who decided to put an end to the friendship between the two girls by forbidding her daughter to interact with yours; all you did was to give your daughter an explanation, which was only fair. I think your daughter is mature enough to understand. Then, if she tells her friend what happened and Anna is confronted with the truth, well, she'll have to find a way to explain herself, maybe she'll see how childish her behavior is.", "No one is to young for the truth. It dosnt need the brutal and raw.", "NTA.  Your daughter now knows that it's because of her friend's mom, not her.  And if Anna hasn't bothered to tell her daughter the reason why, that's on her.", "NTA \n\nWell Anna played a stupid game and she will sooner or later win stupid prizes.", "NTA. It seems you felt she could manage the news, so then fine. My mother told me at the right time some heavy news around that age and I was fine. I dreamed of revenge for a few months and was then over it. I understood her reasons for fibbing over the years but had kind of figured things out myself.", "NTA at all. I was your daughter in a similar situation - best friend's parents decided we weren't allowed to be friends anymore, but for a different reason between them and my parents - except I was six years old. It would have been awful (well, more awful) if my mom hadn't explained why! I would have thought it was my fault or that there was something wrong with me. \n\nYour husband is thinking more about the abstract idea of a child and age-appropriateness than he is about your daughter's specific emotions and needs in this situation. She needs to know that this really isn't about her at all far more than she needs to be shielded from the knowledge that adults can be unreasonable.", "NTA YOU telling  her helped her. Otherwise shes thinking it was something about her. Not good for a tween to think something is wrong with them. Now she knows it\u2019s a jealous adult  and nothing to do with her. That would make me feel better.", "NTA. 12 is absolutely old enough to understand what happened.", "NTA. Your daughter is 12, not 5. I don\u2019t get what your husband thinks is the problem in telling her as she\u2019s plenty old enough to understand the situation and deserves to know that her best friend\u2019s mother is an illogical, horrible, controlling, spiteful person and it\u2019s not her (your daughters) fault at all. If you didn\u2019t tell her, she\u2019d probably think her friend hates her and wonder what she\u2019d done wrong.\n\nAnna created this drama and if Anna\u2019s daughter finds out and is mad at Anna well Anna brought that on herself. I\u2019d rather be yelled at by some crazy asshole than let my daughter think her best friend hates her and she ruined their friendship herself.", "I\u2019m clearly in the minority here, but I think ESH except the kids. \n\nYou\u2019re N T A for telling your daughter the truth. She deserved the truth even if it sucks. Anna clearly isn\u2019t really well-adjusted and it\u2019s really unfortunate that she\u2019s let her own immaturity ruin her daughters friendship. But why I don\u2019t think I understand at all why your response to her initially being upset was \u201ccalm down\u201d (the thing no upset person ever wants to hear) and \u201cmy sister is impulsive and fucks around in meaningless relationships a lot so this will probably end soon\u201d and \u201cwell you never wanted to marry him and you were always on and off so what do you expect\u201d rather than \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re hurt. I had no idea that my sister is dating Doug, it\u2019s just as much of a surprise to you as to me and I hope it doesn\u2019t change anything for our kids.\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
