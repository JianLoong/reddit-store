And clearly she values her own kids more highly than she values your daughter.\n\n>She got upset and called me an AH and said how are we suppose to be together if she can\u2019t make decisions for my kid\n\nThis isn't a decision like what to make for dinner. She made an idiotic decision which endangered your daughter. Not only did she send your daughter to school in weather which is dangerous for her, she *didn't even give your daughter her inhaler to take with her*. Lo and behold, your poor daughter had an asthma attack.

You need to put your daughter first.", "NTA - but an asthma attack literally could kill her. The saddest thing I\u2019ve ever been witness to in my life was a funeral for a 10 year old boy who died from an asthma attack.

Even if she didn't have an asthma attack, it wouldn't change the fact that its clear your gf will disregard your choices for your daughter. And she has no problem being sneaky about it. This had less to do with the gf believing your daughter was healthy enough to go and more to do with your gf prioritizing making her life easier.

Googled it and got feeling close or football club", "NTA. You are her parent and you made the call. However, I have to wonder if there hasn't been a sit down between the two of you on how to work together in parenting your children. Has the asthma been explained in detail, or just \"she's got asthma\" and left at that? Have you agreed to boundaries in dealing with the parenting decisions of the other? It doesn't change the vote, but it could be a better metric for how you proceed.", "NTA - while I understand eventually you both would need to work as a unit her statement of \"the cold won't kill her\" just goes to show how little she knows about your daughter and her asthma....if the school didn't have a back up inhaler the cold quite literally could have killed her if medical intervention didn't happen in time.", "NTA. You are correct - whether or not you made the right decision to keep her home is irrelevant - you are the parent.

Y'all need to sit everyone down and go over this all. And if you and your gf are going to merge the families, then y'all both will need to co-parent all 3 kids.", "NTA you gave specific instructions which were completely warranted, and GF took it upon herself to over ride that, for frankly dumb reasons.

When i was younger i had to miss many days of school because of health ( between 7 and 10) and i didn't like school so i thought it was fun, but i have miss a lot of important class and felt behind very quick and it was very hard to get back on track especially since i already had the habit of skipping...", "NTA she put Ur daughters life at risk dump her negligent butt", "NTA.

But, if there aren\u2019t any other red flags in this relationship, and as long as GF is open to it, I\u2019d suggest education. And teaching her boys that fair is NOT equal. You all should be on the same page when it comes to parenting. If you don\u2019t agree how to raise the kids, then you should end the relationship. \n\nAs a parent of two asthmatic, her comments and approach to asthma is disgusting. She either needs to get educated, or take a hike. Because it LITERALLY COULD KILL HER! GF needs to apologize to you and your daughter. She gets ONE a chance to make this right. \n\nBut, if she argues, minimizes, or gaslights you in any way, the end it immediately. She has to be 100% receptive to understanding how serious this is.", "You have a problem here.\n\nShe's right that if you're going to be a couple, you need to be able to parent each other's kids. Between you, you have three kids of similar age. Your family will only work if they get treated the same. One rule for your kid and different rules for her kids will lead to huge resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, she's an idiot. You had said that Renee should stay home because she had an asthma flareup. Now, perhaps you were being overprotective, and she could have gone in **with her inhaler** and been OK, but you were keeping her home because she was sick. The boys were not sick. It's normal to keep the sick kid home and send the healthy ones in.\n\nAnd given that you told her to do X, if she's going to make the choice to do not-X, she needs to at least talk it over with you.\n\nI think you're right to be concerned about her suitability as a long-term partner.\n\nNTA", "Info: would she have been responsible for caring for your daughter if she didn\u2019t go to school?", "Nta..\nIf she can't explain to her children that yours has a medical condition and put her life at risk. I wouldn't trust her around my child. She couldn't even make sure she had her inhaler?  I'm sure if it was a reason like that she couldn't watch your daughter you would have had your mom come so everyone bashing your decision. The gf obviously could have said something. You trusted her with your child and to make hers feel better put yours at risk. Only goes to show how her kids \"complaints\" are more important then your daughters health.", "NTA, if someone is babying kids here is her, wtf is that bs of \"I put your daughter in danger, so my kids don't get jealous\", serious red flag men, toss that bitch out of your life and concentrate in your daughter's wellbeing.", "NTA. It actually could have killed her though. She sent her without her inhaler! You should definitely break up with gf.", "NTA GF is a health hazard.", ">how are we suppose to be together if she can\u2019t make decisions for my kid\n\nLong term she's right. You can't be with someone you can't trust to make parental decisions for your kid in a pinch, and I wouldn't trust this woman to make those decisions either after this, since she clearly doesn't take a serious medical condition seriously.\n\nNTA but you should consider how this relationship can function given this new information.", "***\"...The cold isn\u2019t going to kill her...\"***\n\nThat would have been the last statement she EVER said to me.\n\nNTA.", "Break up with her.

So happy you held your ground and stick up for your SIX YEAR OLD. I'm sorry but your gf is an idiot and has no right to make decisions for her.", "NTA\n\nHonestly you should be considering if this will even work. Tell her that she can either respect your final decision as her parent or she can leave the relationship. Simple as that, usually im not super rash in breaking up but this matter has to do with your daughters health and safety.", "NTA - but I don't see how your blended family is going to work if you guys can't even navigate an issue like this.", "NTA, and break up with her. There are several key things here: \n\nFirstly, she undermined the parental decision that you had already made, and *\"how are we suppose to be together if she can\u2019t make decisions for my kid\"* is a complete red herring because of that. She didn't need to make a decision because you had already made it, and it was underhanded of her to go behind your back and reverse it instead of supporting you. She cares more about the perception of fairness than either genuine fairness or actual factual child safety.\n\nSecondly, having undermined you and undone your decision, she sent your kid to school without her medication. That was unsafe and yes, neglectful.\n\nThirdly, she is in denial about the seriousness of your daughter's illness, and that has put your child in danger. *\"The cold isn\u2019t going to kill her\"* - wow, yes it could actually! Especially if the teachers hadn't had access to an emergency inhaler left at school! Asthma can be serious, and people do die from it.", "NTA And her kids are plenty old enough to understand that daughter has asthma and needed to stay home! This has more to do with gf not properly parenting her children. Life isn't fair, and apparently she can't teach them that So she punishes your child instead. Makes perfect sense! Lol \n\nLook, she either doesn't trust your parenting, underestimates your daughter's illness, or just doesn't give a damn... Either way this isn't going to work!", "YTA / ESH\n\nYou didn't make childcare arrangements, you just foisted your child onto your GF and then got mad at her when she mad a decision to send all the kids to school. \n\nNext time take responsibility for your child and don't move in with someone who isn't on the same page as you. Your kid needs stability, not random people moving into and out of their lives.", "How is your daughter going to live with life long asthma during the winter? The answer is not keeping her home from school but discussing g her health issues with the school so she can be treated on site if she has a flair up. My step daughter has asthma which flares during dry seasons and she keeps her inhaler in her back pack and has a backup inhaler in the schools office. Your girlfriend needs to be educated on how to handle payout daughters illness and running away from the problem (staying some where else) is not the solution. You cannot run from difficult conversations. Discuss this with your girlfriend and don\u2019t undermine her in front of your daughter or you will have issues if you two get married some day.", "Sorry..  Your GF can't make any decisions on your childs behalf, yet you trust her enough to babysit your child?  If you make the decision not to send your child to school, shouldn't it be you staying home with that child?\n\nIf this is the case, I'd break up with you.  You can't have it both ways", "Why was she in a position like that? You can\u2019t expect someone to take the responsibility for your child without authority. \n\nIf you want to keep your child home, stay home with your kid. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry but the whole \u201cit was cold\u201d is nonsense. She was getting on a bus not walking without a scarf and inhaling frigid air. \n\nYTA for making your GF responsible for your child and for the \u201ckid can\u2019t go to school in the cold\u201d nonsense.", "YTA here bud. \n\nYou're in a relationship with this woman. She has kids of her own and you clearly entrust her to care your your daughter in your absence. You're giving her a lot of responsibility but no authority with your daughter. You two need to sit down and talk this out so you're both on the same page and united when in comes to taking care of all of your kids.", "YTA. Not for wanting your daughter to stay home from school, but for expecting your girlfriend to provide childcare for you on her day off with little to no prior warning. And it's not just that she'd be watching your daughter, with what you've described your daughter really shouldn't be leaving the house, which means your girlfriend wouldn't be able to leave the house. Any plans or appointments she had or errands she was wanting to do would need to be cancelled or rescheduled. And unless you had a conversation with your girlfriend before moving in together where you explained and she agreed that sometimes she would have to stay home with your daughter on short notice, it's an AH move to thrust that onto someone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would need more information because right now everyone is looking like an AH in this situation.", "NTA for being angry, but you need to absolutely end a relationship with someone who is willing to endanger your child's health because she doesn't know how to talk to her kids.\n\nHer endangering your daughter's health because she thinks of your daughter as weak and hates that and wants to break your daughter out of her \"weakness\" is the place to call this quits.", "NTA\n\n>The cold isn\u2019t going to kill her.\n\nBullshit.  My dad had asthma all his life.  Less than a month after his 60th birthday he went for a morning walk.  It was about 28F outside.  It triggered an asthma attack, which led to upper respiratory failure and he died less than an hour later.  Just 4 days after retiring.\n\nYour GF put your daughter in harm's way.  I wouldn't think twice about kicking her out and breaking up with her.", "NTA So because she can't even parent her own kids, yours needs to run the risk of dying? Um. That would be a nope.", "NTA \n\nMy cousin was 8 and he also had asthma after a fight my uncle made him walk to school it wasn't even 10 minutes away but he never made it.", "ESH. If your daughter needed to stay home you should have offered to stay home with her, not have expected your girlfriend to care for her. GF should have told you if she disagreed with having your daughter stay home,  instead of just making a decision on her own to send her to school. With this kind of a dynamic between the two of you,  the future of your relationship,  and the emotional health of all of the children,  seem to be at risk.", "INFO:  is GF a SAhm or work from home?did she agree to watch the kid all day? Did OP just assume she would? \n\nThere\u2019s just some fishy background that he didn\u2019t know she was at school until 2 hours later, and GF who was left with the child seemingly didn\u2019t want her at home. \nShe\u2019s still awful though", "Exactly can't wait until she actually kills the child.", "Surprised how far I had to scroll for this comment. That's what struck me, it literally could have killed her, WTAF was this woman thinking? OP needs to walk away now. NTA obvs.", "When the opposite occurs OP is taking care of her children and they are sick. She just doesn't know how to parent her own kids.", "My daughters only missed 3 days due to asthma this school year. It\u2019s not a ton of days. That\u2019s why this was unreasonable action.", "We have discussed it before. And early on in our relationship my girlfriend and I sat down and I explained how bad my daughters asthma was and precautions and solutions for it.  I\u2019ve actually wrote her a list for it because before we moved in together we\u2019d watch the others children sometimes or take them out. We also talked about it before we moved In together and she understands the importance of protection from the cold and her inhaler.", "She\u2019s only missed 3 days this year due to asthma. Her inhaler is a life savor but on really cold days I don\u2019t like to test fate and watch my daughter deal with the struggle. We do our best to miss as little events or schooling as possible due to it.", "We watch each other\u2019s children often. We have a place together it\u2019s an agreement.", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. I was imagining that in my head and I\u2019m so sorry if this is weird and but I pictured it like you were my daughter, bc my daughter has had attacks in the bathroom alone and It made me feel horrible I didn\u2019t know. You deserve someone who understands", "You still married to this guy? Like seriously... \nGeez \nMy hubby has a respiratory condition (not asthma) and I am concerned every time he coughs more or less. When he chokes on something (he does that frequently) I get a heart attack. So whats wrong with your husband?", "Yo...he was laughing when you couldn't breathe??? He didn't even give you your inhaler, he just stepped over your body?!\n\nHoney, that could have killed you...I'm sorry but...why are you still with this guy? You two are married, he was supposed to understand better than anybody else...", "It can improve, and different medicines can help improvement. Right now my daughter has a daily inhaler and a nebulizer at night time. She\u2019s already pretty good at carrying her inhaler and knowing when she need to use it. The teachers and nurse at school also know incase she ever needs help or suggested to use it. We have a doctors appointment coming up where we\u2019d like to discuss more efficient options. She has only missed 3 days this school year due to her asthma so it isn\u2019t like she\u2019s constantly absence.", "I\u2019m sorry for you loss", "No nothing fishy in my eyes. \n\nShe has two boys and when they are sick he will look after them on his days off. He said in comments that he did this quite a few times. \n\nSo in return he of course expects her she take care of his daughter on her days off. Otherwise he or his mom would look after the girl. \n\nThe girl has missed three days this school year so far.\n\nSo all in all an absolutely normal day in a life of a family. Besides this idiot woman who endangered a kid for absolute no reason at all.", "She works but was off today. If she had to work my mother would have picked her up to be watched.", "This is what I\u2019m getting with the comments about babying.", "That\u2019s what got me too. Like she wants to make decisions about the child but needs to make informed decisions. I would have been livid if I was him.", "Well, if she\u2019s going to ignore all that then it\u2019s time to move out. She can\u2019t be arsed to parent her own kids so she takes it out on yours. You would be TA to your kid if you let this continue.", "It\u2019s an agreement that she will watch your child on her day off when she is not asked to do so?", "Wait-- so you don't want her to make parental decisions, but you get to tell her she's babysitting on her day off? If you want your daughter to stay home, that should be on you to stay home and watch her.", "No. You arrange child care on all the days and don't expect her to give up her free time.\n\nYou can't say \"you aren't the parent\" then expect her to take the responsibilities of a parent", "Exactly! Sure, he wanted his daughter to stay home, but who would've stayed home with her?", "She did not say she had other plans though. \n\nShe said it was not fair to her boys and she was not able to explain to them why they needed to go to school while OPs daughter got to stay at home. \n\nI don't know how you make \"she probably had plans\" out of it now.", "No he wants her to be a sitter when needed. Just like he is sitting her boys on his day off.", "I mean I have for her many of times.", "I watch her children as wel on my day off. And 2 days out of a school year is not something to complain over", "It\u2019s not reasonable to expect her to provide child care at a moment\u2019s notice.", "If your daughter\u2019s asthma is that bad, how often is she off school vs your girlfriend\u2019s kids being off school?", "My daughters only missed 3 days this year due to asthma, 2 of which my gf had to watch her.", "Well she proved that she is not a fit parent. So no she has no say in parenting his daughter and thats for a reason. \n\nThey have an agreement I watch yours if you watch mine. So basically she's a sitter in that situation. \n\nAnd if you hire a sitter its not like they can overrule a parents decision."]}
