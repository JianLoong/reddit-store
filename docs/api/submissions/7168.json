I told my gf to just let her stay home and I\u2019d call the school, I had to work so she was putting the kids on the bus. She did the exact opposite, she thought putting long sleeves+ sweater+ jacket, would make her warm enough to go and sent her in, Without her inhaler. Which like I said resulted in a flare up. Luckily it was at school and they have her back up inhaler there. I got a call 2 hours later saying my daughter has had an asthma attack and it was under control but I could come get her if I\u2019d like. I had no idea she even went to school. I immediately called my girlfriend and asked her what she was thinking and her response was, \u201cbc Renee stayed home from school, the boys wanted to too, and it wasn\u2019t fair so I made her go.

Because you know its unfair for your daughter and stuff. \n\nDon't think so. \n\nLet that sink in. And reconsider this relationship. \n\nYou did great as single father. You put your daughter first.

You need to put your daughter first.", "NTA - but an asthma attack literally could kill her. The saddest thing I\u2019ve ever been witness to in my life was a funeral for a 10 year old boy who died from an asthma attack. If you can\u2019t trust your girlfriend with your child\u2019s health then you can\u2019t trust your girlfriend.

Even if she didn't have an asthma attack, it wouldn't change the fact that its clear your gf will disregard your choices for your daughter. And she has no problem being sneaky about it. This had less to do with the gf believing your daughter was healthy enough to go and more to do with your gf prioritizing making her life easier.

It doesn't change the vote, but it could be a better metric for how you proceed.", "NTA - while I understand eventually you both would need to work as a unit her statement of \"the cold won't kill her\" just goes to show how little she knows about your daughter and her asthma....if the school didn't have a back up inhaler the cold quite literally could have killed her if medical intervention didn't happen in time.", "NTA.

Y'all need to sit everyone down and go over this all. And if you and your gf are going to merge the families, then y'all both will need to co-parent all 3 kids.", "NTA you gave specific instructions which were completely warranted, and GF took it upon herself to over ride that, for frankly dumb reasons.

When i was younger i had to miss many days of school because of health ( between 7 and 10) and i didn't like school so i thought it was fun, but i have miss a lot of important class and felt behind very quick and it was very hard to get back on track especially since i already had the habit of skipping...", "NTA she put Ur daughters life at risk dump her negligent butt", "NTA.

But, if there aren\u2019t any other red flags in this relationship, and as long as GF is open to it, I\u2019d suggest education. And teaching her boys that fair is NOT equal. You all should be on the same page when it comes to parenting. If you don\u2019t agree how to raise the kids, then you should end the relationship. \n\nAs a parent of two asthmatic, her comments and approach to asthma is disgusting. She either needs to get educated, or take a hike. Because it LITERALLY COULD KILL HER! GF needs to apologize to you and your daughter. She gets ONE a chance to make this right. \n\nBut, if she argues, minimizes, or gaslights you in any way, the end it immediately.

Between you, you have three kids of similar age. Your family will only work if they get treated the same. One rule for your kid and different rules for her kids will lead to huge resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, she's an idiot. You had said that Renee should stay home because she had an asthma flareup. Now, perhaps you were being overprotective, and she could have gone in **with her inhaler** and been OK, but you were keeping her home because she was sick. The boys were not sick. It's normal to keep the sick kid home and send the healthy ones in.\n\nAnd given that you told her to do X, if she's going to make the choice to do not-X, she needs to at least talk it over with you.\n\nI think you're right to be concerned about her suitability as a long-term partner.\n\nNTA", "Info: would she have been responsible for caring for your daughter if she didn\u2019t go to school?", "Nta..\nIf she can't explain to her children that yours has a medical condition and put her life at risk. I wouldn't trust her around my child. She couldn't even make sure she had her inhaler?  I'm sure if it was a reason like that she couldn't watch your daughter you would have had your mom come so everyone bashing your decision. The gf obviously could have said something. You trusted her with your child and to make hers feel better put yours at risk. Only goes to show how her kids \"complaints\" are more important then your daughters health.", "NTA, if someone is babying kids here is her, wtf is that bs of \"I put your daughter in danger, so my kids don't get jealous\", serious red flag men, toss that bitch out of your life and concentrate in your daughter's wellbeing.", "NTA. It actually could have killed her though. She sent her without her inhaler! You should definitely break up with gf.", "NTA GF is a health hazard.", ">how are we suppose to be together if she can\u2019t make decisions for my kid\n\nLong term she's right. You can't be with someone you can't trust to make parental decisions for your kid in a pinch, and I wouldn't trust this woman to make those decisions either after this, since she clearly doesn't take a serious medical condition seriously.\n\nNTA but you should consider how this relationship can function given this new information.", "***\"...The cold isn\u2019t going to kill her...\"***\n\nThat would have been the last statement she EVER said to me.\n\nNTA.", "Break up with her.

I'm sorry but your gf is an idiot and has no right to make decisions for her.", "NTA\n\nHonestly you should be considering if this will even work. Tell her that she can either respect your final decision as her parent or she can leave the relationship. Simple as that, usually im not super rash in breaking up but this matter has to do with your daughters health and safety.", "NTA - but I don't see how your blended family is going to work if you guys can't even navigate an issue like this.", "NTA, and break up with her. There are several key things here: \n\nFirstly, she undermined the parental decision that you had already made, and *\"how are we suppose to be together if she can\u2019t make decisions for my kid\"* is a complete red herring because of that. She didn't need to make a decision because you had already made it, and it was underhanded of her to go behind your back and reverse it instead of supporting you. She cares more about the perception of fairness than either genuine fairness or actual factual child safety.\n\nSecondly, having undermined you and undone your decision, she sent your kid to school without her medication. That was unsafe and yes, neglectful.\n\nThirdly, she is in denial about the seriousness of your daughter's illness, and that has put your child in danger. *\"The cold isn\u2019t going to kill her\"* - wow, yes it could actually! Especially if the teachers hadn't had access to an emergency inhaler left at school! Asthma can be serious, and people do die from it.", "NTA And her kids are plenty old enough to understand that daughter has asthma and needed to stay home! This has more to do with gf not properly parenting her children. Life isn't fair, and apparently she can't teach them that So she punishes your child instead. Makes perfect sense! Lol \n\nLook, she either doesn't trust your parenting, underestimates your daughter's illness, or just doesn't give a damn... Either way this isn't going to work!", "YTA / ESH\n\nYou didn't make childcare arrangements, you just foisted your child onto your GF and then got mad at her when she mad a decision to send all the kids to school. \n\nNext time take responsibility for your child and don't move in with someone who isn't on the same page as you. Your kid needs stability, not random people moving into and out of their lives.", "How is your daughter going to live with life long asthma during the winter? The answer is not keeping her home from school but discussing g her health issues with the school so she can be treated on site if she has a flair up. My step daughter has asthma which flares during dry seasons and she keeps her inhaler in her back pack and has a backup inhaler in the schools office. Your girlfriend needs to be educated on how to handle payout daughters illness and running away from the problem (staying some where else) is not the solution. You cannot run from difficult conversations. Discuss this with your girlfriend and don\u2019t undermine her in front of your daughter or you will have issues if you two get married some day.", "Sorry..  Your GF can't make any decisions on your childs behalf, yet you trust her enough to babysit your child?  If you make the decision not to send your child to school, shouldn't it be you staying home with that child?\n\nIf this is the case, I'd break up with you.  You can't have it both ways", "Why was she in a position like that? You can\u2019t expect someone to take the responsibility for your child without authority. \n\nIf you want to keep your child home, stay home with your kid. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry but the whole \u201cit was cold\u201d is nonsense. She was getting on a bus not walking without a scarf and inhaling frigid air. \n\nYTA for making your GF responsible for your child and for the \u201ckid can\u2019t go to school in the cold\u201d nonsense.", "YTA here bud. \n\nYou're in a relationship with this woman. She has kids of her own and you clearly entrust her to care your your daughter in your absence. You're giving her a lot of responsibility but no authority with your daughter. You two need to sit down and talk this out so you're both on the same page and united when in comes to taking care of all of your kids.", "YTA. Not for wanting your daughter to stay home from school, but for expecting your girlfriend to provide childcare for you on her day off with little to no prior warning. And it's not just that she'd be watching your daughter, with what you've described your daughter really shouldn't be leaving the house, which means your girlfriend wouldn't be able to leave the house. Any plans or appointments she had or errands she was wanting to do would need to be cancelled or rescheduled. And unless you had a conversation with your girlfriend before moving in together where you explained and she agreed that sometimes she would have to stay home with your daughter on short notice, it's an AH move to thrust that onto someone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
