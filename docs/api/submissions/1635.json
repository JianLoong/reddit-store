The individuals who know what all went down, to include her willfully exposing your fragile infant to sickness that she herself thinks could be something potentially fatal to an infant, and yet still think you should comply just to keep the peace... These people can also not be trusted with your child. Especially not around her.", "Absolutely NTA. First off it is weird to take someone else\u2019s child and lock yourself away with them. And then you couldn\u2019t find them. That had to have been terrifying. And then she felt sick and exposed a baby who is probably still too young to have vaccines and is incredibly vulnerable is the middle of flu and cold season with a side of Covid still happening. That is absolutely not an intelligent choice and it seems that she may be mentally unwell. You should always be able to find your son at that age and no one should be trying to get him sick. Also maybe I\u2019m dark but I immediately panicked and was thinking about a kidnapping situation.", "NTA. This is one of the reasons I always had my babies in a carrier / sling of some description when visiting family.", "NTA. I can't have babies, so I put all my energy into being an aunt and holding my nieces and nephew and even I wouldn't do this. You don't lock yourself in a room with someone else's baby. And while sick?! COVID and RSV are killing and disabling people. When my eldest niece was born in 2018, I wasn't sick, so I held her. When my other niece was born a few weeks ago, I refused visiting in the hospital so I wouldn't get sick and could hold her when they came home. But more importantly, when my nephew was born at the end of 2020, I didn't hold him for months because I had COVID. I avoided being near him. Everyone had had COVID and were still infected, but didn't have symptoms. I did. I hated not being able to hold him for months, but do you know what I would have hated more? Putting him at risk. Cut your sister out of your life. And anyone who sides with her behavior. It's not safe. How would she feel if someone did this to her baby?", "And locking herself in a room with the kid for an hour without even telling anyone. \nI can't even imagine how panicked I would have been if my baby vanished for over an hour. \nJust for that alone the sister is a big ahole.\nPutting a new mom through that stress, and what if something had happened. A a fire. Or something happened to the baby. No one knew they were in there, and the door was locked. \n\nThat's just not normal. \nAnd topping it off with \"I need to Hold the baby or I'm not okay\" \nWoman should get herself some therapy and work through whatever insecurity or fears she has. \nAnd take the family with her to therapy if they think this monkey circus is normal and all fine.\nNot saying she would do it. But if she can vanish with the baby at a party, who says she won't suddenly vanish or walk off with the kid to bond for hours.", "*In addition to the pandemic*, Peds ICUs across the country are understaffed and already overloaded with respiratory illnesses this fall. There are numerous posts about it. If you can keep your little ones safe and out of the hospital, *do it.*", "And there is so much RSV going around this year.", "Can you talk to her husband or your parents about her behavior? She might be having issues with her mental health during her pregnancy. A lot of women have to quit medication for anxiety/depression cold turkey when they're pregnant and she might be struggling, not to mention the risk she has for PPD. This might be a symptom of something much deeper that needs addressed and could put your niece/nephew at risk", "Omg my first thought too. Thank god I wasn\u2019t the only one.

Your sister earned a time out.", "Babies are more resilient than they seem and if you're breastfeeding him, you're providing him with your immunity as well. If not, while formula is not as good in this regard, the formula is also made to boost your baby's immune system and his growth.\n\nAlso, by not letting your sister hold the baby, you're doing her a favour, even if she doesn't realise it. She has an unhealthy attachment to your son and letting it go on wouldn't be healthy for her.\n\nNTA, OP. Not at all.", "It's a problem here in Texas too, my new grandbaby's pediatrician warned us about this. RSV is no joke and I've been a severe asthmatic since I was a baby so you reacted a lot more calmly than I would have. For a baby this could be a death sentence. NOBODY gets to risk your child. NOBODY. Not for \"family unity\". Not for any reason. She needs to understand what she did and truly remorsefully apologize! And grovel.

If anything, it will make her loose what's left of her rational mind", "She could have killed your infant and she's acting in the extreme? I would go NC and feel no guilt at all.", "So, everyone thinks the baby is theirs to decide?\n\nSeriously- are all of them not seeing the issue with her hogging a BABY and locking herself away with the baby??   \nI think she may need help or supervision when she is due - as this sounds not entirely stable.\n\nNTA", "NTA - she seems very emotionally unstable.

That isn't rational behaviour. On top of that she knew she was sick with something that could make the baby dangerously ill. Was she trying to make the baby ill? Is she jealous?", "NTA. Even if she hadn't been sick (that alone makes her a major AH), the fact that she walked off without a word and locked herself in with your! son for an hour is outrageious!
