Wtf? How did you wait an hour? I'd have emptied the house room by room and then called police if the baby wasnt found .immediately Your sister kidnapped your child, and endangered him with her illness. Why are you asking if she shouldnt hold the baby? She shouldnt even be in the same room, home, building as your baby? She's a threat to your childs safety", "NTA,  you have the task of keeping your baby as healthy as you can.  She stole your baby and could have killed him and now she expects your child to be her \"feel good pill\".  Oh hell no.  \n\nI went to a friend's baby shower and one of the others there had a baby about the same age as yours.  Now the mother made you sanitize your hands before you could even look at her baby.  I thought it was a little nuts, but I did it because I wanted to look at the babies.   I love babies and would be ok holding them all the time, but am also OK if the parents said no.", "NTA. keep your son safe! My mom didn't even let anyone touch me till I was a toddler. You're the parent. You get to have the absolute decision of what's best.", "Why is everyone okay with her trying to pass a pulmonary infection onto an infant?!? NTA", "Absolutely NTA\n\nI never respond to things, but this made me angry on your behalf. \n\nlocking yourself away with an infant that's not yours & saying you can only be happy if you're holding him is not normal behavior. I wouldn't leave your son alone with her for that alone\n\nThen she was sick while she did it? Fuck no. Babies under a certain age with a fever likely are going to need a spinal tap. Flu & RSV(which often causes a cold in adults) can be fatal to babies. Both are extremely bad this year & there are huge chunks of the country without available PICU beds- like there are literally Facebook groups of doctors trying to find beds for sick kids\n\nAnyone who puts their own warped sense of happiness above your child\u2019s life should stay far away from them", "NTA.  Stay strong.", "NTA. She needs professional help, ideally before she has her kid.", "NTA", "NTA.  If anyone had disappeared with my (theoretical at this point) baby-- sick or not-- I would be extremely disturbed.", "NTA\n\nThere are times when you have to act like mama grizzly bear. That was not ok. Shut down any argument about your decision, that its final and not negotiable and that at least for this issue - it is your way or the highway.", "WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!\n\nNTA! NTA!\n\nDo your parents and siblings NOT read, listen to the news or understand how fragile newborn's immune systems are?   \n\nDo they not understand that a 'simple cough' in an adult could be fatal for a newborn?  \n\nDo they not see the news that CHILDREN's Hospitals are being overrun with kids that have RSV right now?  \n\nEvery fall and winter there are PSA's on TV in my area talking about how simple coughs or colds could be fatal to newborns and to stay away/take precautions. What your sister did was horribly irresponsible - I wonder if she will realize what she did when she has her child or if she will be just as careless? Is she going to birthing classes where she will find out all sorts of horrors that can happen to her child? IF not, she should.\n\nThere is plenty of information and cautionary tales out there about newborns getting ill from what was thought of as a 'simple' cough in an adult.  Find them and do some research and give it to your ignorant family.  You may save your future niece or nephew's lives.", "NTA. Anyone who locks themself away in a room with a baby that is not theirs is not mentally fit enough to be around children. Who the fuck knows what she did in there with him? Keep your baby away.", "It is creepy that she would lock herself away with your baby. What was she doing in there? Keep your baby away from her because she has already abused her priviledge. She should see her doctor or a therapist if your child is the only thing making her happy. I hope the best for her.", "When we babysit my nephew who\u2019s about 18 months, my MIL would wear a mask inside the home if she were sick to not get him or anyone else sick, it\u2019s legit not hard", "This\u2026 I would have gone NC with her because she could have killed my son\u2026 You are NTA but your sister is and she", "I feel like even without being sick, locking herself in a room with a baby that ISN\u2019T HERS is not ok.  Major boundary crossing\u2026 \ud83d\ude33", "I would at least stay away until she has her own baby. And frankly anyone else who is pushing you to forgive her as I wouldn\u2019t trust them to hold your boundaries.\n\nThankfully that looks to be 6-7 months in all likelihood but let her have her own baby to cough on.", "We\u2019ll, the only one looking out for your child\u2019s physical welfare seems to be you and your husband. Your father would rather his mentally unstable daughter get what she wants at the risk of the welfare of his grandchild. Basically, you can\u2019t trust his opinion or judgment in the situation. Err on the side of caution until your baby is old enough to defend himself.", "Glad I'm not thr only one who feels this way.", "Yep!  OP needs to never let the sister babysit.  She might not get her child back.", "RSV is going around the world and that kills babies. You need to be incredibly careful this winter.", "Yeah that kind of attachment isn\u2019t going to be healthy for her baby.", "Honestly it\u2019s going around everywhere right now, I\u2019m in the Kansas City area and it\u2019s brutal. I\u2019m a medically fragile adult that currently has it and it\u2019s fucking awful, knowingly exposing a small child let alone a newborn to it is horrendous.", "It\u2019s bad in Kentucky and Indiana too:(", "Yeah luckily I\u2019m a pretty healthy teen so when I got sick it didn\u2019t take much time get over, but my mom and brother have asthma so it\u2019s more risky with them. I am so appalled that the sister thought this was ok, and she\u2019s gonna be a mom!"]}
