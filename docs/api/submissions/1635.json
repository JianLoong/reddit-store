We recently had a party at my parents house for friends and extended family to meet my son. During the party Sis wouldn\u2019t let anyone else hold him. At one point I couldn\u2019t find either of them for over an hour and it turned out she had locked herself in my parents bedroom with my son. \n\nThen I found out that the whole time she was holding him she was sick with some sort of cough (she thought it might be strep or bronchitis). I was furious and told Sis that if she can\u2019t respect my son\u2019s safety and my boundaries, she won\u2019t be allowed to hold him anymore.\n\nNow whenever I visit she follows me around begging to take a turn holding him and telling me that \u201cthis is the only way I can be happy\u201d.

She isn't pregnant and miserable, she's pregnant and likely suffering from mental illness that needs treatment.\n\nYour sister needs to talk to a therapist or psychiatrist about her feelings and behavior. You may not be the one to recommend that, but someone in her trusted orbit needs to make sure she has the support she needs before and after she has a baby.", "NTA.
