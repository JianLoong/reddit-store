Why are you asking if she shouldnt hold the baby? She shouldnt even be in the same room, home, building as your baby? She's a threat to your childs safety", "NTA,  you have the task of keeping your baby as healthy as you can.  She stole your baby and could have killed him and now she expects your child to be her \"feel good pill\".  Oh hell no.  \n\nI went to a friend's baby shower and one of the others there had a baby about the same age as yours.  Now the mother made you sanitize your hands before you could even look at her baby.  I thought it was a little nuts, but I did it because I wanted to look at the babies.   I love babies and would be ok holding them all the time, but am also OK if the parents said no.", "NTA. keep your son safe! My mom didn't even let anyone touch me till I was a toddler. You're the parent. You get to have the absolute decision of what's best.", "Why is everyone okay with her trying to pass a pulmonary infection onto an infant?!? NTA", "Absolutely NTA\n\nI never respond to things, but this made me angry on your behalf. \n\nlocking yourself away with an infant that's not yours & saying you can only be happy if you're holding him is not normal behavior. I wouldn't leave your son alone with her for that alone\n\nThen she was sick while she did it? Fuck no. Babies under a certain age with a fever likely are going to need a spinal tap. Flu & RSV(which often causes a cold in adults) can be fatal to babies. Both are extremely bad this year & there are huge chunks of the country without available PICU beds- like there are literally Facebook groups of doctors trying to find beds for sick kids\n\nAnyone who puts their own warped sense of happiness above your child\u2019s life should stay far away from them", "NTA.  Stay strong.", "NTA. She needs professional help, ideally before she has her kid.", "NTA", "NTA.  If anyone had disappeared with my (theoretical at this point) baby-- sick or not-- I would be extremely disturbed.", "NTA\n\nThere are times when you have to act like mama grizzly bear. That was not ok. Shut down any argument about your decision, that its final and not negotiable and that at least for this issue - it is your way or the highway.", "WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!\n\nNTA! NTA!\n\nDo your parents and siblings NOT read, listen to the news or understand how fragile newborn's immune systems are?   \n\nDo they not understand that a 'simple cough' in an adult could be fatal for a newborn?  \n\nDo they not see the news that CHILDREN's Hospitals are being overrun with kids that have RSV right now?  \n\nEvery fall and winter there are PSA's on TV in my area talking about how simple coughs or colds could be fatal to newborns and to stay away/take precautions. What your sister did was horribly irresponsible - I wonder if she will realize what she did when she has her child or if she will be just as careless? Is she going to birthing classes where she will find out all sorts of horrors that can happen to her child? IF not, she should.\n\nThere is plenty of information and cautionary tales out there about newborns getting ill from what was thought of as a 'simple' cough in an adult.  Find them and do some research and give it to your ignorant family.  You may save your future niece or nephew's lives.", "NTA. Anyone who locks themself away in a room with a baby that is not theirs is not mentally fit enough to be around children. Who the fuck knows what she did in there with him? Keep your baby away.", "It is creepy that she would lock herself away with your baby. What was she doing in there? Keep your baby away from her because she has already abused her priviledge. She should see her doctor or a therapist if your child is the only thing making her happy. I hope the best for her.", "When we babysit my nephew who\u2019s about 18 months, my MIL would wear a mask inside the home if she were sick to not get him or anyone else sick, it\u2019s legit not hard", "This\u2026 I would have gone NC with her because she could have killed my son\u2026 You are NTA but your sister is and she", "I feel like even without being sick, locking herself in a room with a baby that ISN\u2019T HERS is not ok.  Major boundary crossing\u2026 \ud83d\ude33", "I would at least stay away until she has her own baby. And frankly anyone else who is pushing you to forgive her as I wouldn\u2019t trust them to hold your boundaries.\n\nThankfully that looks to be 6-7 months in all likelihood but let her have her own baby to cough on.", "We\u2019ll, the only one looking out for your child\u2019s physical welfare seems to be you and your husband. Your father would rather his mentally unstable daughter get what she wants at the risk of the welfare of his grandchild. Basically, you can\u2019t trust his opinion or judgment in the situation. Err on the side of caution until your baby is old enough to defend himself.", "Glad I'm not thr only one who feels this way.", "Yep!  OP needs to never let the sister babysit.  She might not get her child back.", "RSV is going around the world and that kills babies. You need to be incredibly careful this winter.", "Yeah that kind of attachment isn\u2019t going to be healthy for her baby.", "Honestly it\u2019s going around everywhere right now, I\u2019m in the Kansas City area and it\u2019s brutal. I\u2019m a medically fragile adult that currently has it and it\u2019s fucking awful, knowingly exposing a small child let alone a newborn to it is horrendous.", "It\u2019s bad in Kentucky and Indiana too:(", "Yeah luckily I\u2019m a pretty healthy teen so when I got sick it didn\u2019t take much time get over, but my mom and brother have asthma so it\u2019s more risky with them. I am so appalled that the sister thought this was ok, and she\u2019s gonna be a mom!", "NTA. That is your baby. Your son is your sole focus. Not your sister\u2019s \u201chappiness.\u201d Not your family\u2019s opinion of you. He is a being under your protection. Not a toy you have to share. It\u2019s not like you said you didn\u2019t want her in his life, just that she can\u2019t hold him.\n\nYour boundary to draw, your baby, don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.", "NTA, especially as she's ill.", "Who steals a baby and hides away with them in a locked room? Seriously- no one in your family sees that red flag waving in their faces?? I feel pretty confident in saying you shouldn't even trust her holding your Cabbage Patch Kid, let alone your real kid. \n\nNTA", "Is Sis intellectually challenged?", "She locked herself away with the baby? And she was sick?? This all sounds really weird to be honest. I would keep my distance from her. \n\nHopefully her own baby will satisfy her enough to not latch onto other ones.", "OP NTA. I don\u2019t think people always realize how dangerous illnesses are for infants, and just how quickly they can go from fine to very ill. I had an infant in my class, all day was great happy, smiling, the becan of health. The next morning mom text me to say they were rushed to the ED because they spiked a fever. Spent a week in a children\u2019s hospital. If you have anything even if you think it\u2019s just allergies it\u2019s best to take precautions.", "NTA - stick to your guns. I wouldn't trust her either.", "NTA.  Your child, your choice.  Don\u2019t even have to get into how creepy and disgusting this behavior is.", "NTA. SHE WAS SICK AND LOCKED HERSELF UP WITH HIM!!! \n\nIF GE CAUGHT ANYTHING WHAT WOULD SHE SAY?? SORRY WONT CUT IT. BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.  SHE CAN CARRY HER BABY AFTER BIRTH!", "NTA she could have literally given the baby something to make her sick. I met my new niece yesterday and kept a mask on while holding her. Our jobs are to protect kids who can't protect themselves", "Op make sure in case of issues someone  other than parents or sis get access", "NTA\n\nThat is a massive no no to hold the baby while sick. I would have flipped myself. I will also note that your sister probably needs some therapy to deal with \"this is the only way i can be happy\"", "NTA and I'd be worried about her kidnapping the child if I was you.", "NTA. She endangered your child (holding him when she knew she was sick) AND caused you stress by hiding with him. \n\nAnd why does she NEED to bond with her nephew when her own baby is on the way? Plus she was preventing everyone else (including other family members AND the child\u2019s mother) from holding and bonding. Something is psychologically wrong with her. \n\nKeep her from holding the baby, the closest she should get is sitting nearby.", "NTA, your child comes first, if shes miserable without holding him then maybe she should next time not be a horrible aunt, i feel bad for her baby", "NTA. She locked herself in a room with your child for over an hour. That\u2019s not okay. And it\u2019s not a good idea to have your baby growing up thinking that that\u2019s normal or okay. That\u2019s weird and creepy. \nYour baby is not her emotional support animal.\nShe shouldn\u2019t be at family gatherings sick, and certainly not holding peoples babies.\nShe sounds delusional, mentally ill. \nDoes she think the baby she\u2019s pregnant with is just gonna sit in her purse and go everywhere and do everything with her? She\u2019s not naming it Tinkerbell right?", "NTA, babies aren't emotional support animals", "NTA. Sister hid with your baby while she was sick and essentially put his life in danger. He's your son so you decide who gets to interact with him (obviously within reason, which in this situation it is.)", "NTA\u2014 I\u2019d get some distance from them all.", "NTA. \nYour sister is bonkers. \nDo not let her hold him. \nShe was LOCKED in a room with him\u2026. And she was SICK\u2026. Why?!!\nWhy would she think this was acceptable behavior? \nThe Fam members who support her should be kept at arm\u2019s length too. \n\nSit the one down with the most influence and explain that your sister went missing WITH YOUR BABY\u2026and locked herself inside a room\u2026 with your baby!  In other words, YOUR BABY WAS MISSING for (time) and your sister couldn\u2019t be bothered to text you that she had the baby \u2026. This is unacceptable and if (that relative) thinks it is fine, then you will have to reevaluate your relationship\u2026", "NTA", "Heck no! I would be livid! You never hold a baby if you\u2019re sick. RSV is running rampant here in AZ, my son just got over it. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t to the point of hospitalization, but he was super sick for a week straight. You are definitely NTA!", "Not as long as it has a endpoint somewhere.", "You could think about if there is a path available to your sister where she could earn back your trust. If yes, maybe it\u2019s things like she can hold him for five minutes, but only after you have observed her for an hour to satisfy yourself that she isn\u2019t unwell, and she does hand sanitizer or maybe a mask first. Then if she doesn\u2019t give him back right away she goes back into the no hold zone for a certain interval before trying again. If she does, maybe she is allowed to hold him longer next time.\n\nI\u2019d be very clear with her about the rules and what the consequences will be for breaching your boundaries\n\nGood practice for dealing with kids when they are older too lol\n\nBut if you just don\u2019t want to deal with her that is your right as a mom. She certainly didn\u2019t show terribly good judgment, did she? NTA", "OMG, the lack of boundaries with these people!  Heaven forbid OP has boundaries and exercises them.  \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nI\u2019m just so annoyed with families playing the go along to get along to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d.  It\u2019s so unhealthy.\n\nOP, absolutely NTA, but Sis is", "YOUR BABY YOUR RULES!!!!! Don't back down to her emotional blackmail!", "NTA your baby isnt a doll to be passed around like an accessory. She cab hold her own baby when they come", "Babies are not a sit-and-spin, not everybody gets a turn.\n\nNTA, mom.", "NTA who tf locks themselves up with someone else's baby?!? That's fucking weird outside of the fact that she ENDANGERED YOUR BABY!", "I can\u2019t imagine locking yourself up with someone else\u2019s child for an hour. She was the AH for that alone. The fact that she gets to see that child, and be in the same room, is a major blessing. \n\nI would never let my sister see my son, ever again.", "Oh my god, THANK YOU!  We're all getting hung up on the \"sick\" part but hiding away with a tiny baby in a locked room without letting the parents know is basically kidnapping in my book.  That is horrifying.", "I haven\u2019t left her alone with him since (or even with other family members since they clearly don\u2019t think her behavior is an issue). My husband has been bringing the baby into whatever room I\u2019m in when I need to pump and taking care of him there where we can both see him so we know he\u2019s safe", "OP has said that it's suspected the sister might have NPD, but she's not diagnosed. Even if it's true, it's an explanation and not an excuse for her behaviour.", "She locked herself up in the bedroom with YOUR baby. Even if we disregard the fact that she was sick, it's fucking creepy to do that with someone else's infant and god knows what she will do next. For the safety of your own child, you might even want to consider a restraining order if she doesn't stop.", "I can 100% understand your husband", "Your sister is bonkers. \n\nNoCo is the right response. \nShe STOLE YOUR BABY\u2026 and hid in a locked room. \n\nNot acceptable. And anyone of your fam who sides with her should get a NoCo too.", "Your son is not your sister's emotional support baby.", "Yep. That is the most messed up part. That isn't normal.  And would get me to permanently ban her from ever seeing that child.\n\nUnstable", "NPD, as difficult as it is, comes second. Your child's physical health and wellness comes first. \n\nYour dad may choose to coddle your sister, but that's not your problem and if they can't respect your boundaries it's time to lower contact to a minimum. And in your position, I wouldn't let your sister have _anything_ to do with your child going forward.", "Elsewhere you say you love her. But this is the time to love your child more. \n\nAnd it sounds like your sister really isn't capable of real adult love, she's come unhinged from reality.", "Yes. Nobody saw where she went and she has a separate apartment on my parents property so I searched that first, the the yard, then the main house.", "Yeah\u2026 he\u2019s never liked her much because of the way she behaves. I only hesitate to go NC because she\u2019s still my sister and I love her. But it\u2019s just getting to be too much, yk?", "Yeah its probably gonna be pretty hard, but its the significantly safer option to your child with the lengths she would go to to be with your child", "Agreed. I'm already sorry for the kid...hopefully she gets it out of her system in the first year or she's going to be trying to take its first steps for it or something."]}
