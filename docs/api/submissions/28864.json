Mom left us shortly after I was born so I've never really had a maternal figure growing up. I've tried to ask my Dad why Mom left, but he would always try to dodge the question.\n\nAnyways, this kinda of messed me up a little bit as a kid because I would always blame myself for her leaving. And it also didn't help that my older brothers would always use the ole trusty. \"You're why Mom left!\" Card in arguments. \n\nDuring my middle school years, my Mom began to call me and my brothers. She swore up and down for years that she wanted me back in her life but didn\u2019t make any effort to get to know me. So that woman broke a lot of promises with me and my brothers. \n\nThe last straw for me was when she didn't come to a beauty pageant I\u2019d been excited for for months. I know that sounds really petty, but at the time, it was really important to me, and she swore up and down that she would come. Of course, she broke that promise, too. \n\nSo when Mom called to \"apologize\" for not, I let that woman have it. I think the call almost lasted an hour and a half, and it was mostly just me cussing her out. Obviously, ever since that phone call, I've been no contact with her. \n\nBut a few days ago, my Dad texted me if I wanted to have dinner with him and the boys, saying that he was going to make my favorite meal. Of course, I agreed. \n\nI walk in the house, and I hear my dad and my brothers talking. Nothing unusual, of course, but then I hear a woman laugh. So I walked to the kitchen and saw my Dad, Lyle and Kyle laughing and talking with my mother. So, at this point, I'm pissed and confused. And I think I thought out loud because I said \"What the fuck is she doing here.\"\n\nEveryone immediately becomes silent, until Dad starts talking. Basically he says that I need to watch my tone, and that all they want to do is talk to me about their future. And I'm like, what are you talking about? Then, my mother had the great idea to drop the bombshell that her and dad got back together and had been dating for months.\n\nI think you can understand how gooped I was from this information. But then Lyle tells me that basically everyone in the immediate family knew about the relationship besides me because \"they were worried about how I would react.\"\n\nSo I'm still standing there, shaking with rage. So when my dad tried to grab my arm to sit me down so we could \"talk\", I snatched it back and basically stormed out the house. \n\nNow, I've been bombarded from texts from my dad and Lyle, saying I was immature and made mom cry.

Of course you walked out! What else were they possibly expecting?\n\nSome people like surprises. They're supposed to be *good* surprises, though. Your father is an AH for suddenly springing this on you. This is something that should have been introduced well in advance and discussed.

You were blindsided by this. No one said anything because they KNEW you would be angry and were trying to soften your reaction with a done deal. Make it clear to everyone in the family, and especially your dad and brothers, that you cannot dictate their choices, just like they cannot dictate yours, and if they are willing to let her back in and likely get burned again then that\u2019s up to them.

Tell your dad and brothers that you love them, but they better not pressure you into anything and you have no qualms to cutting them (and any flying monkeys they try to send your way) out of your life. Tell them that in the event there is a family get together (dinner, holidays, reunions, etc.) you will be civil, but that you will be treating her as the new wife that you refuse to call stepmom (or mom in this case) and will only acknowledge her as such. She is not to try and parent you. She is not to try and give you life advice unless YOU ask her for such. She is not to try and step into your life as mom. She gave up that right with regards to you long ago, and she does not get it back unless YOU choose to let her. NO ONE is to try to guilt you into accepting her back, especially her.", "NTA. There is nothing like being ambushed by a situation and the only one that didn\u2019t know what was going on.  How did they expect this was going to go?  Seems pretty stupid to keep this a secret and then spring it on you.

Given that *brothers* always said it was my fault mom left, how do you think I feel knowing that everyone else knew and kept it from me, and then decided on a spectacular trap under the guise of dinner - were you all trying to make me leave?\n\nEven putting all that aside, she sought out a relationship with me when I was in middle school, and then repeatedly let me down or bailed. I\u2019m sure you would have had a lot to say if it was my friends that acted that way, so why is it different for her?\n\nAs an adult, with adult children, you can of course date, marry, take off on a world tour etc - whatever you want. As much as this choice confuses me given everything we dealt with after she left, your life is now your own again and I hope whatever path you choose makes you happy. However, I at the very least need time to process this and decide where I now fit into this. You all certainly made it seem like the problem is me, but I\u2019m struggling to understand how a person that hurt me thinks they can just waltz back into my life and I\u2019m supposed to be happy about it. \n\nI need time, I also need some answers when I am ready.

I would have lost all trust and respect for them if that was me. They are AH for that. Your father should have told you separately, one on one. Not mislead you into coming to a family dinner, then springing your absent mother on you. They are in the wrong, and they know this, thats why they are texting you and blaming you. Also, it's very hurtful that they are blaming you for making your mum cry. What about your feelings? Don't they care that they sprung this on you, lied to you, then sent insulting text for you. They act as if they care more for this woman.\n\nThe fact that they are texting you calling you immature is hypocritical considering what  they you did. They knew you would react poorly, so we decided to force you into an interaction where they knew you would react poorly. Like, what did they expect.\n\nMoving forward, I would suggest therapy. Maybe go low contact until things cool down.\nYour dad and brother are adults and can have a relationship with anyone they want. You get to choose if you still want to be involved in their lives. You can still have relationships with your brothers separate from your mother. Your dad may be a different story. He may agree to see you for dinners or coffee without your mum, or he may decline.\n\nJust have the boundary of not bringing your mother up around you and respecting each other's choices even though you may not agree with them.\n\nEither way, don't let them bully you into something you don't want to do.

Is it because she never showed up when she said she would?  Is it because I am a fucking adult and I still don't know why she left in the first place?  You are upset that i made her cry, but does anyone care about all of the times she made me cry?  Did you really expect me to be excited and welcoming to the person who broke my heart over and over for years?  \n\nOP, you are NTA, and if YOU want to, you could try having a conversation with your father and brothers away from your egg donor.  But your father, brothers, and mother are acting horribly, and you have every right to take as much time and space away from them as you need.  Family is not blood.

Narcissist people don\u2019t change and they will gaslight you into making you feel guilty for THEIR BEHAVIORS.  Me personally? I\u2019d go low to now contact. Why? Because unless you\u2019re prepared to have everyone act like nothing wrong happened and that your feelings of resentment aren\u2019t valid- then save yourself the feeling of being crazy or wrong. Talk to a therapist and see what they recommend for the time being. No one should judge you for not wanting to have a relationship with them. And it might sound harsh bc you love them but where was their love when they let everyone else know what was going on and it took MONTHS for you to find out?  They could have told you but chose not to.", "There must be public records of such things. Might be worth a look.", "Trust is not the word I would use, but I still love them very much. \n\nThey've never done anything this hurtful, besides Lyle, but what he does is tame compared to this. \n\n(He mainly makes fun of my fashion sense.)", "Seriously! Are they just forgetting that they blamed oop?", "Ofc! Thank you so much!", "You have decisions to make", "I know, I'm just hoping I make the right ones", "There are no forever decisions (except maybe having kids). Don\u2019t like your job? Quit. Don\u2019t like your house? Move. Don\u2019t like your spouse? Divorce.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want a relationship with \u201cmom\u201d now? Don\u2019t have one. Is she going to deny you a relationship in the future? No. Will dad forgive you? Yes, and if he doesn\u2019t, screw him. Your brothers? They are selfish, not intentionally but it\u2019s where they are in life.\n\nSo long story short - no wrong decision  - whatever decision you make  - so long as the decision doesn\u2019t negatively impact your mental health. \n\nNTA, not even close.", "Take your time, tell them their actions have consequences and you'll decide when/if you're ready to speak to them again. Block them and take your time to think for yourself with no-one whispering in your ear."]}
