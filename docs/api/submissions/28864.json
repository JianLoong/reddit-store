Mom left us shortly after I was born so I've never really had a maternal figure growing up. I've tried to ask my Dad why Mom left, but he would always try to dodge the question.\n\nAnyways, this kinda of messed me up a little bit as a kid because I would always blame myself for her leaving. And it also didn't help that my older brothers would always use the ole trusty. \"You're why Mom left!\" Card in arguments. \n\nDuring my middle school years, my Mom began to call me and my brothers. She swore up and down for years that she wanted me back in her life but didn\u2019t make any effort to get to know me. So that woman broke a lot of promises with me and my brothers. \n\nThe last straw for me was when she didn't come to a beauty pageant I\u2019d been excited for for months. I know that sounds really petty, but at the time, it was really important to me, and she swore up and down that she would come. Of course, she broke that promise, too. \n\nSo when Mom called to \"apologize\" for not, I let that woman have it. I think the call almost lasted an hour and a half, and it was mostly just me cussing her out. Obviously, ever since that phone call, I've been no contact with her. \n\nBut a few days ago, my Dad texted me if I wanted to have dinner with him and the boys, saying that he was going to make my favorite meal. Of course, I agreed. \n\nI walk in the house, and I hear my dad and my brothers talking. Nothing unusual, of course, but then I hear a woman laugh. So I walked to the kitchen and saw my Dad, Lyle and Kyle laughing and talking with my mother. So, at this point, I'm pissed and confused. And I think I thought out loud because I said \"What the fuck is she doing here.\"\n\nEveryone immediately becomes silent, until Dad starts talking. Basically he says that I need to watch my tone, and that all they want to do is talk to me about their future. And I'm like, what are you talking about? Then, my mother had the great idea to drop the bombshell that her and dad got back together and had been dating for months.\n\nI think you can understand how gooped I was from this information. But then Lyle tells me that basically everyone in the immediate family knew about the relationship besides me because \"they were worried about how I would react.\"\n\nSo I'm still standing there, shaking with rage. So when my dad tried to grab my arm to sit me down so we could \"talk\", I snatched it back and basically stormed out the house. \n\nNow, I've been bombarded from texts from my dad and Lyle, saying I was immature and made mom cry.

Of course you walked out! What else were they possibly expecting?\n\nSome people like surprises. They're supposed to be *good* surprises, though. Your father is an AH for suddenly springing this on you. This is something that should have been introduced well in advance and discussed.

You were blindsided by this. No one said anything because they KNEW you would be angry and were trying to soften your reaction with a done deal. Make it clear to everyone in the family, and especially your dad and brothers, that you cannot dictate their choices, just like they cannot dictate yours, and if they are willing to let her back in and likely get burned again then that\u2019s up to them.

Tell your dad and brothers that you love them, but they better not pressure you into anything and you have no qualms to cutting them (and any flying monkeys they try to send your way) out of your life. Tell them that in the event there is a family get together (dinner, holidays, reunions, etc.) you will be civil, but that you will be treating her as the new wife that you refuse to call stepmom (or mom in this case) and will only acknowledge her as such. She is not to try and parent you. She is not to try and give you life advice unless YOU ask her for such. She is not to try and step into your life as mom. She gave up that right with regards to you long ago, and she does not get it back unless YOU choose to let her. NO ONE is to try to guilt you into accepting her back, especially her.", "NTA. There is nothing like being ambushed by a situation and the only one that didn\u2019t know what was going on.  How did they expect this was going to go?  Seems pretty stupid to keep this a secret and then spring it on you.

Given that *brothers* always said it was my fault mom left, how do you think I feel knowing that everyone else knew and kept it from me, and then decided on a spectacular trap under the guise of dinner - were you all trying to make me leave?\n\nEven putting all that aside, she sought out a relationship with me when I was in middle school, and then repeatedly let me down or bailed. I\u2019m sure you would have had a lot to say if it was my friends that acted that way, so why is it different for her?\n\nAs an adult, with adult children, you can of course date, marry, take off on a world tour etc - whatever you want. As much as this choice confuses me given everything we dealt with after she left, your life is now your own again and I hope whatever path you choose makes you happy. However, I at the very least need time to process this and decide where I now fit into this. You all certainly made it seem like the problem is me, but I\u2019m struggling to understand how a person that hurt me thinks they can just waltz back into my life and I\u2019m supposed to be happy about it. \n\nI need time, I also need some answers when I am ready.

I would have lost all trust and respect for them if that was me. They are AH for that. Your father should have told you separately, one on one. Not mislead you into coming to a family dinner, then springing your absent mother on you. They are in the wrong, and they know this, thats why they are texting you and blaming you. Also, it's very hurtful that they are blaming you for making your mum cry. What about your feelings? Don't they care that they sprung this on you, lied to you, then sent insulting text for you. They act as if they care more for this woman.\n\nThe fact that they are texting you calling you immature is hypocritical considering what  they you did. They knew you would react poorly, so we decided to force you into an interaction where they knew you would react poorly. Like, what did they expect.\n\nMoving forward, I would suggest therapy. Maybe go low contact until things cool down.\nYour dad and brother are adults and can have a relationship with anyone they want. You get to choose if you still want to be involved in their lives. You can still have relationships with your brothers separate from your mother. Your dad may be a different story. He may agree to see you for dinners or coffee without your mum, or he may decline.\n\nJust have the boundary of not bringing your mother up around you and respecting each other's choices even though you may not agree with them.\n\nEither way, don't let them bully you into something you don't want to do.

Is it because she never showed up when she said she would?  Is it because I am a fucking adult and I still don't know why she left in the first place?  You are upset that i made her cry, but does anyone care about all of the times she made me cry?  Did you really expect me to be excited and welcoming to the person who broke my heart over and over for years?  \n\nOP, you are NTA, and if YOU want to, you could try having a conversation with your father and brothers away from your egg donor.  But your father, brothers, and mother are acting horribly, and you have every right to take as much time and space away from them as you need.  Family is not blood.

That is messed up.", "You are not considering them using \"you're why mom left\" card repeatedly!", "You are immature and made mom cry? The same woman that chose to leave you for your whole life?\n\n Your parents should be able to produce a really good explanation as to why she wasn't in your life. Something as serious as, for example she was abducted for a decade, and still it wouldn't make it ok. At this point   mommy is  crying and your relatives are snapping at you .. It makes me angry. Keep yourself safe from these people.", "Remember you don\u2019t know why your mum left. Your dad does. Maybe he knows the woman she is - some people cannot cope with parenthood. Perhaps now that you are all grown up, their relationship can revert to what it was. You do not have to accept her but he is an adult and he can make his own decisions. Your dad handled this badly but he obviously is not a bad person. You are hurt but give it some time and then reach out to your dad. He obviously loves you a lot. NTA", "You said they never did anything hurtful, BUT throwing the blame that \"she left because of you\" was seriously hurtful!!!!! She also has a huge part in that hurt, of course, because of her actions, but they need to collectively lol at the damage they have done to you. And maybe open their eyes and realize that she has done too much for you to come back from her actions and abandonment.", "I wonder if she was an affair baby, possibly of dad's?", "You've just been infantilised - as in treated like a child.

He blames OP for being immature when he never communicated and blindsided OP.\n\nWhere is his apology? Where is his acknowledgment that this was a poor way to handle the situation? Where is his concern for OP\u2019s emotions? What about all the times that OP would have been hurt and cried over this woman growing up?\n\nWhere is his concern for his daughter?\n\nIf you call this love, I\u2019d hate to see what you call disdain.", ">.

Yet she was blamed.\n\nTime for 23 and me..", "He also lied to her for months and set up this dinner situation to blindside her, because he knew how incredibly hurt and betrayed OP would feel - rightfully so. \n\nI think some time out to process would probably help.", "If only someone would have said to her father \"don't get into a relationship with the woman who abandoned OP. It will be negative for her and it's something to consider.\"", "Take your time! Don\u2019t rush things. Maybe it would be good to go NC/LC for this time so you can decide what you want in the future.\n\nNTA for your reaction", "OP, NTA. And I agree with the top responses to your comment here.\n\n* You can decide that you want nothing to do with 'mom' and little/nothing to do with (dad/Lyle/Kyle) FOR NOW. And you can tell them that. You can also be clear that if they hound you with (1) blame for the past family breakup, (2) expectation that you should embrace your 'mom' now/ telling you your reaction is wrong, (3) blame for the 'family' not being together now... If they hound you with any of those things, you will cut off the contact even more/even longer.\n* You hit the nail on the head. You love your dad and brothers, but you cannot trust them now. Trust was even all the more important to you because of the many, many, countless ways your 'mom' betrayed your trust over the years. So the trust you have had in your dad and brothers was all the more important to you AND now they have betrayed it. And they did so BIG-time:\n\n1. First, you need to see that your dad never helped you deal with your feelings of guilt over her leaving. Your brother's actively FED that guilt most of your life, and your dad didn't even try to stop them. That was and remains a betrayal of your dad's duty of care for you and the basic decency that your family should have treated you with.\n2. Knowing how many times your mom has broken her word to you, they chose to engage in secretly building a relationship with her - actively hiding it from you. (It was their right to build a relationship with her - whether or not you liked it - but the secrecy was a whole new level of gut-punch.)\n3. They don't talk to you in any way to prepare you for the fact they now want you to know that they have a close relationship with 'mom'. They spring it on you! They are absolute fools. What did they think was going to happen??? (They hid things from you because they were worried about how you would react. So they think springing it on you is going to get them a good reaction - like you were going to say, \"*Haha! Good one! I guess I'll go hug 'mom' now and we'll all play Happy Family now!*\" ?!?!)\n4. And now they are blaming you for not just loving the surprise betrayal they sprang on you. You dad and brothers don't deserve your trust for a long while.\n\n* It occurs to me that your dad and brothers MAY have fed that guilt you felt because THEY did blame you. And, given the way your 'mom' has treated you over the years, maybe her leaving had to do with you. BUT THE GUILT IS ALL HERS TO SHOULDER, NOT YOURS. You were an actual baby. But even if you had been older (actually walking and talking), your mom leaving was ALL ABOUT HER and HER WEAKNESS OF CHARACTER. I have to wonder if she has some deep insecurity about females (felt that her standing as THE female in the family was threatened by a little baby girl). That's just conjecture, but there is/was something wrong with her!\n* And there's something wrong with your dad that he would allow her to repeatedly damage you and break apart your family and still embrace her.\n\nI'm sorry for what your family has done to you and for emphasizing it. I do hope that this helps you take the space and time you need from them right now (no more guilt!!!). It has to be hard to stand up for yourself when the people closest to you are *en masse* telling you that you are wrong. Please take every comment here to build your certainty that you are absolutely right to be hurt and upset and right to protect yourself from their harm.\n\nRight now is a very good time for you to focus on you - building your career, your circle of friends and other important relationships, your self-confidence and self-love, your pastimes and how you engage with life and the world. Good wishes to you.", "This is the absolute best answer. And completely, 100%  correct. Op please read this response then re-read then read it again. And please whatever you choose, choose it for YOU. Not your dad or your brothers and not your \"mom\" either. Choose what best for you and makes you happy, even if your happy is their unhappy.
