Mom left us shortly after I was born so I've never really had a maternal figure growing up. I've tried to ask my Dad why Mom left, but he would always try to dodge the question.\n\nAnyways, this kinda of messed me up a little bit as a kid because I would always blame myself for her leaving. And it also didn't help that my older brothers would always use the ole trusty. \"You're why Mom left!\" Card in arguments. \n\nDuring my middle school years, my Mom began to call me and my brothers. She swore up and down for years that she wanted me back in her life but didn\u2019t make any effort to get to know me. So that woman broke a lot of promises with me and my brothers. \n\nThe last straw for me was when she didn't come to a beauty pageant I\u2019d been excited for for months. I know that sounds really petty, but at the time, it was really important to me, and she swore up and down that she would come. Of course, she broke that promise, too. \n\nSo when Mom called to \"apologize\" for not, I let that woman have it. I think the call almost lasted an hour and a half, and it was mostly just me cussing her out. Obviously, ever since that phone call, I've been no contact with her. \n\nBut a few days ago, my Dad texted me if I wanted to have dinner with him and the boys, saying that he was going to make my favorite meal. Of course, I agreed. \n\nI walk in the house, and I hear my dad and my brothers talking. Nothing unusual, of course, but then I hear a woman laugh. So I walked to the kitchen and saw my Dad, Lyle and Kyle laughing and talking with my mother. So, at this point, I'm pissed and confused. And I think I thought out loud because I said \"What the fuck is she doing here.\"\n\nEveryone immediately becomes silent, until Dad starts talking. Basically he says that I need to watch my tone, and that all they want to do is talk to me about their future. And I'm like, what are you talking about? Then, my mother had the great idea to drop the bombshell that her and dad got back together and had been dating for months.\n\nI think you can understand how gooped I was from this information. But then Lyle tells me that basically everyone in the immediate family knew about the relationship besides me because \"they were worried about how I would react.\"\n\nSo I'm still standing there, shaking with rage. So when my dad tried to grab my arm to sit me down so we could \"talk\", I snatched it back and basically stormed out the house. \n\nNow, I've been bombarded from texts from my dad and Lyle, saying I was immature and made mom cry.

Of course you walked out! What else were they possibly expecting?\n\nSome people like surprises. They're supposed to be *good* surprises, though. Your father is an AH for suddenly springing this on you. This is something that should have been introduced well in advance and discussed.

You were blindsided by this. No one said anything because they KNEW you would be angry and were trying to soften your reaction with a done deal. Make it clear to everyone in the family, and especially your dad and brothers, that you cannot dictate their choices, just like they cannot dictate yours, and if they are willing to let her back in and likely get burned again then that\u2019s up to them.

Tell your dad and brothers that you love them, but they better not pressure you into anything and you have no qualms to cutting them (and any flying monkeys they try to send your way) out of your life. Tell them that in the event there is a family get together (dinner, holidays, reunions, etc.) you will be civil, but that you will be treating her as the new wife that you refuse to call stepmom (or mom in this case) and will only acknowledge her as such. She is not to try and parent you. She is not to try and give you life advice unless YOU ask her for such. She is not to try and step into your life as mom. She gave up that right with regards to you long ago, and she does not get it back unless YOU choose to let her. NO ONE is to try to guilt you into accepting her back, especially her.", "NTA. There is nothing like being ambushed by a situation and the only one that didn\u2019t know what was going on.  How did they expect this was going to go?  Seems pretty stupid to keep this a secret and then spring it on you.

Given that *brothers* always said it was my fault mom left, how do you think I feel knowing that everyone else knew and kept it from me, and then decided on a spectacular trap under the guise of dinner - were you all trying to make me leave?\n\nEven putting all that aside, she sought out a relationship with me when I was in middle school, and then repeatedly let me down or bailed. I\u2019m sure you would have had a lot to say if it was my friends that acted that way, so why is it different for her?\n\nAs an adult, with adult children, you can of course date, marry, take off on a world tour etc - whatever you want. As much as this choice confuses me given everything we dealt with after she left, your life is now your own again and I hope whatever path you choose makes you happy. However, I at the very least need time to process this and decide where I now fit into this. You all certainly made it seem like the problem is me, but I\u2019m struggling to understand how a person that hurt me thinks they can just waltz back into my life and I\u2019m supposed to be happy about it. \n\nI need time, I also need some answers when I am ready.

I would have lost all trust and respect for them if that was me. They are AH for that. Your father should have told you separately, one on one. Not mislead you into coming to a family dinner, then springing your absent mother on you. They are in the wrong, and they know this, thats why they are texting you and blaming you. Also, it's very hurtful that they are blaming you for making your mum cry. What about your feelings? Don't they care that they sprung this on you, lied to you, then sent insulting text for you. They act as if they care more for this woman.\n\nThe fact that they are texting you calling you immature is hypocritical considering what  they you did. They knew you would react poorly, so we decided to force you into an interaction where they knew you would react poorly. Like, what did they expect.\n\nMoving forward, I would suggest therapy. Maybe go low contact until things cool down.\nYour dad and brother are adults and can have a relationship with anyone they want. You get to choose if you still want to be involved in their lives. You can still have relationships with your brothers separate from your mother. Your dad may be a different story. He may agree to see you for dinners or coffee without your mum, or he may decline.\n\nJust have the boundary of not bringing your mother up around you and respecting each other's choices even though you may not agree with them.\n\nEither way, don't let them bully you into something you don't want to do.

Is it because she never showed up when she said she would?  Is it because I am a fucking adult and I still don't know why she left in the first place?  You are upset that i made her cry, but does anyone care about all of the times she made me cry?  Did you really expect me to be excited and welcoming to the person who broke my heart over and over for years?  \n\nOP, you are NTA, and if YOU want to, you could try having a conversation with your father and brothers away from your egg donor.  But your father, brothers, and mother are acting horribly, and you have every right to take as much time and space away from them as you need.  Family is not blood.

And I agree with the top responses to your comment here.\n\n* You can decide that you want nothing to do with 'mom' and little/nothing to do with (dad/Lyle/Kyle) FOR NOW. And you can tell them that. You can also be clear that if they hound you with (1) blame for the past family breakup, (2) expectation that you should embrace your 'mom' now/ telling you your reaction is wrong, (3) blame for the 'family' not being together now... If they hound you with any of those things, you will cut off the contact even more/even longer.\n* You hit the nail on the head. You love your dad and brothers, but you cannot trust them now. Trust was even all the more important to you because of the many, many, countless ways your 'mom' betrayed your trust over the years. So the trust you have had in your dad and brothers was all the more important to you AND now they have betrayed it. And they did so BIG-time:\n\n1. First, you need to see that your dad never helped you deal with your feelings of guilt over her leaving. Your brother's actively FED that guilt most of your life, and your dad didn't even try to stop them. That was and remains a betrayal of your dad's duty of care for you and the basic decency that your family should have treated you with.\n2. Knowing how many times your mom has broken her word to you, they chose to engage in secretly building a relationship with her - actively hiding it from you. (It was their right to build a relationship with her - whether or not you liked it - but the secrecy was a whole new level of gut-punch.)\n3. They don't talk to you in any way to prepare you for the fact they now want you to know that they have a close relationship with 'mom'. They spring it on you! They are absolute fools. What did they think was going to happen??? (They hid things from you because they were worried about how you would react. So they think springing it on you is going to get them a good reaction - like you were going to say, \"*Haha! Good one! I guess I'll go hug 'mom' now and we'll all play Happy Family now!*\" ?!?!)\n4. And now they are blaming you for not just loving the surprise betrayal they sprang on you. You dad and brothers don't deserve your trust for a long while.\n\n* It occurs to me that your dad and brothers MAY have fed that guilt you felt because THEY did blame you. And, given the way your 'mom' has treated you over the years, maybe her leaving had to do with you. BUT THE GUILT IS ALL HERS TO SHOULDER, NOT YOURS. You were an actual baby. But even if you had been older (actually walking and talking), your mom leaving was ALL ABOUT HER and HER WEAKNESS OF CHARACTER. I have to wonder if she has some deep insecurity about females (felt that her standing as THE female in the family was threatened by a little baby girl). That's just conjecture, but there is/was something wrong with her!\n* And there's something wrong with your dad that he would allow her to repeatedly damage you and break apart your family and still embrace her.\n\nI'm sorry for what your family has done to you and for emphasizing it. I do hope that this helps you take the space and time you need from them right now (no more guilt!!!). It has to be hard to stand up for yourself when the people closest to you are *en masse* telling you that you are wrong. Please take every comment here to build your certainty that you are absolutely right to be hurt and upset and right to protect yourself from their harm.\n\nRight now is a very good time for you to focus on you - building your career, your circle of friends and other important relationships, your self-confidence and self-love, your pastimes and how you engage with life and the world.

(And that violating your boundaries, like they already have done, will make it take longer for you to process this.)\n\nAnd then stop responding to them.\n\nAnd go talk to a therapist. People with this much bullshit in their lives need it. Make sure that your therapist isn't one with a unicorn for parent-child relationships. \"I'm not saying that this is where things are going, but if I told you that I couldn't see myself wanting to see my father ever again, would you tell me I had to suck it up out of respect I owe my parents?\"", "Your brothers bullied you about your mother and now they expect you to forget and forgive? Delusional and cruel.", "why TF should she be waiting for the dad to forgive her??? he tricked her and then attacked her for reacting negatively. he's gross. he should apologize to op period. i'd never speak to any of them again.", "Spoken like a teenager who has never tried to get a job, buy a house, marry the right person.", "This.\n\nNTA do whats right for you.\n\nThe thing with family issues like this is there will be a different interpretation for different family members, and that can colour decsions.  Without reading into it to much (sorry I realise this is reddit) but it could just be the dad and brothers deluded themselves into thinking you would come around to the idea of the happy family because thats what they felt they wanted.\n\nIf they have no inner demons to trouble them over this good for them.  Doesn't mean its good for you or makes you less of a person.", "I have said it many times and it applies here as well, giving birth does not make you a mother. \n\nOP: I am sorry that you have gone through this. It is bad enough that she abandoned you at such a young age but even worse that she continued to play with your emotions by making empty promises over the years.\n\nYour feelings are valid. Your Father and Brothers can choose to forgive and forget BUT you are under no obligation to do so.\n\nI could never welcome a partner who chose to abandon my kids and I back into my and their life. Dr. Maya Angelou shared a quote once that truly resonated with me: \u2018When a person shows you who they really are, believe them. Believe them the first time.\u2019\n\nYour egg donor and surrogate showed you time and time again who she was.

That should have been a conversation between the two of you.\n\nThey want you to forgive and forget. But the forgiveness is for them, for your Dad to feel better about this decision and for your Mom to feel better about her abandoning you and playing with your emotions for years. \n\nTake as much time as you need. Consider every angle. Talk to a trusted friend. Talk to a therapist. Make the decision that is best for you at this moment. \n\nI wish you peace.", "Well, sometimes when someone is upset because people don\u2019t share news with them, the best thing is for that person to do some self analysis to figure out what they do which is so off putting to other people that they choose to not tell them things.", "Post-partum depression? Perhaps. But that doesn\u2019t explain the years of mom ghosting OP. Both Dad and Mom should be ashamed for putting OP in this position.", "They did it because she gets upset and emotional.   If Mom had been fine, this might have worked.  But it didn't, and it only made the bad news worse and gave her less time to come to terms with it.", "INFO: Did mom ever tell you why she abandoned you? Or apologize? I'd want to know before going further.", "NTA. Has your mother explained why she was a flake? She needs to start with an honest discussion of her behavior. She needs to open up to being a shitty parent. Then, maybe you can work from there.", "My biodad specifically said that he only wanted my mom's inheritance at pre-divorce proceeds- refusing anything to do with me. Mom's asked me what I'd do if I ever meet him, I know I'd be pulling fists first. Perhaps take that approach with them , because I pronounce you NTA", "Uh yes. You\u2019re 20.

It is really too late for her to be 'mom' now.", "UpdateMe", "NTA. I'm nearly 60 and I would feel BETRAYED that they were all playing HAPPY FAMILY behind my back, especially considering all the years of neglect and mounting disappointments.  You are entitled to your feelings and they shouldn't be shaming you for making your mother cry.  Your behavior was a direct result of her behavior all those years.  You have to decide if you can move on and be a part of this new family dynamic or if you need space.  Do what is best for you!", "So just out of curiosity what's in it for your mom? Why is she getting back together with a man she's already abandoned at least once. Why is she back now? Her other sugar daddies closed their wallets? What happens when she finds another sugar daddy and gets a better offer, then decides it's time to leave again? Are you expected to help pick up the pieces of Dad's life, help with the cooking and cleaning because you're the last female standing in Dad's and the twins' lives? FTS.

To be betrayed like that by all of them  (dad, lyle, kyke)  is brutal.\n\nTelling you that they said nothing because they didn't know how you'd react is bs. They knew exactly how'd you'd react. All of us here on Reddit reading your post knew exactly how you'd react before you told us. \n\nThey are the immature ones,  trying to hide and postpone telling you that not only was your dad talking to your mom more often,  but dating too. \n\nThey are bombing you with text messages etc because they are not getting the family reconciliation like they'd fantasize would happen. That's immature behavior.\n\nI am sorry you've been betrayed like this. By a mother who vanished for years after your birth,  only to reenter your life and repeatedly let you down and not show up. For your older brothers to blame a newborn she was the reason their mother ran away and continued saying that throughout your school years. For a father who didn't stop the emotional abuse his older children were putting you through. \n\nThe only person who matters, should matter, to you right now... is you.\n\nDo what is best for your mental and emotional well-being.
