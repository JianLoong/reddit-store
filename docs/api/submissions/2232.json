It's a weird logic that stealing money is okay if you didn't know what it was meant for.", "NTA\n\n>My parents agree that if she knew she wouldn't have touched it.\n\nSo, what, if YOUR money was for ,say, cinema it would've been okay to take it?? Wtf, what the money is for has nothing to do with the fact that she STOLE money quite knowingly! She doesn't have an excuse for that and your parents should really do a better job of teaching her that. Not to mention weed is actually really bad for health! Especially on teenagers because it affects the brain and hormone balance which we all know are pretty unstable and still developping in teenagers. Your parents should've also kept an eye on that. \n\nYou should totally get your sister to reimburse you. Also, consider the fact that your's and your sister's weed might be the cause of your cat's illness. At least ask the vet to test that out.", "NTA, but why on earth is everyone just cool with a 16 year old smoking weed, especially at that quantity?", "Your parents seem more supportive of Kate than you.  Maybe your parents can give you the money to take Tyson to the vet, then.\n\nEdited to add:  You are definitely not the AH and I hope Tyson makes a full recovery.", "NTA Tell your parents if they are *that* understanding they surely can cover the vet costs so you won't have to miss the appointment -- you assume that the money they have in their wallets is just there to buy things they don't need like snacks and hair accessories. They can just leave their wallets out on the table. You'll help yourself and you're sure they won't miss the cash. \n\nThe fact that your sister didn't think of the potential consequences of her actions doesn't make them cease to exist. It just makes her selfish and thoughtless as well. It turns out the money was needed for something truly important -- but she shouldn't need to know that for sure in order to decide not to steal from you to buy drugs.", "NTA\n\nShe SAYS she wouldn't have stolen it, but I find it hard to believe that. She's probably lying so your parents won't be angry at her. \n\nSince your parents think her thieving is okay, *they* should give you the $70 for the vet. \n\nI hope your cat gets well soon.", "Your parents are BACKING your sister who stole money to pay for weed? WTF?", "NTA um maybe don\u2019t steal peoples money", "NTA, she stole from you. Doesn\u2019t matter what the money was for, it was yours. She deserves it and your parents are endorsing her crappy behaviour.", "NTA - It doesn't matter if that money was for you to go to a bar and get wasted, the fact of the matter is your sister STOLE money from you. She is a thief. She should now be looking for a job in order to pay you back - and you're not wrong if something were to happen to your cat it IS her fault.", "If your parents are OK with it, then they should reimburse you for what she stole.\n\nIn the meantime, please ask your vet if you can do some sort of payment plan, don't let your kitty suffer because of your sister.", "NTA what the heck is wrong with your parents based on their reaction I'd like to say congrats to you on being such a well-formed human. I'm so sorry this is happening to you and your cat but it seems like if your parents are so okay with your sister stealing then they should cough up the money to make sure he sees his vet. How incredibly unfair to you I hope your cat's okay!", "NTA and you got her to admit it. Tell her to pay you back or you will press charges. If your parents want to defend her perhaps they will give you the money. She deserves repercussions for her actions. For weed? Pretty pathetic", "Seems like your sister believes stealing is fine, unless the money is for something she agrees is important.\n\nYou need to help her to understand that stealing is never okay.\n\nNTA", "Nta! She shouldn't have touched your money no matter if she didn't know it was for your cat Tyson. I hope he gets better by the way. She needs to feel guilty about what she did and maybe your parents to need to stop and get her help and job if she can't afford to get her own bud.", "NTA, if she wants to smoke her life away that's her choice but theft is wrong. Period. Full stop. And if she's stealing specifically to fund her habit, it's already become a dependency.\n\nIs there any chance your parents would lend you the money until you get paid?\n\nWhile it's no one's responsibility to pay that back but your sister, the most important thing right now is to make sure your cat is okay! As someone who's had a pothead spent my rent money on weed, I understand that depth of frustration when money with a purpose literally goes up in smoke. Keeping your kitty in my thoughts!", "NTA she deserves to feel bad about it", "NTA. Your sister needs to feel horrible about it. She needs to know it will be her fault if something bad happens to your cat. She needs to sit with that discomfort and learn from it. If everyone around her tells her it\u2019s not a big deal, chances are she will do it again. If however she is made to realize just how crappy it was, maybe she will learn from this mistake and not do it again. She should also have to pay it back somehow as well.", ">She started crying and said she didn't realise it was to take my cat to the vet, and she was stupid and I shouldn't make her feel even worse about it. My parents agree that if she knew she wouldn't have touched it. \n\nYet, all of that means jack diddly because theft is a shitty thing to do, specifically and particularly, when there is no need behind it. She stole 70 bucks to go get high and do stupid shit. She deserves to be reminded that her lack of knowledge is irrelevant and that she's a shitty person and should work on that.\n\nNTA", "NTA. she shouldn't have touched it in the first place because it's your money man. $70 dollars is a lot, it shouldn't matter what you're spending it on, she shouldn't be stealing it. i hope your cat's okay man", "NTA. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t steal from other people to begin with, no matter what the money was going to be used for? Hopefully she learns, otherwise stealing once she\u2019s an adult will have more legal consequences.\n\nI hope your cat is okay! :(", "NTA - She stole for you", "IDGAF what it was for. Stealing is stealing.\nI would\u2019ve said much worse though so kudos to you.\nYou are absolutely NTA!!
