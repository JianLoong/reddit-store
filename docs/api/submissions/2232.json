Best of luck to you! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "Nta it doesn't matter WHAT the money was for.  Your sis is an addict who steals to fund her habit.", "NTA but it\u2019s clear you have big problems in your household that is going to take serious intervention and parental participation to fix, and it\u2019s clear your parents checked out if they\u2019re making up excuses to cover for your minor sister smoking up that heavily and stealing money from her family members. Something is deeply wrong in your house and you, someone barely legal yourself, do not have the finances or life experience to fix it. \n\nThere is one thing you can do now: rehome your cat. From the details you give it\u2019s clear your cat is quite sick and it\u2019s not clear if you can actually afford this cat\u2019s care. If he\u2019s at that kind of risk in just two weeks you need to get him into emergency and it\u2019s clear you can\u2019t afford it time-wise (driving him damn well a city over to find a spare appointment) and money-wise. Your cat is not in a safe home, and ywbta to your little guy if you didn\u2019t consider his safety and whether you can actually afford him. Just because he\u2019s cute and good for pets and you like his company doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s actually being cared for sufficiently by you, even with best intentions.\n\nIf your parents aren\u2019t going to help you get this cat the immediate medical care he needs, please do the right thing and get him to people who CAN give him that. Then use the money you\u2019ve been saving to try and get the hell out. Your sister is on track to steal from you again and you can\u2019t trust your parents to stop her.", "NTA. Stealing money to feed a dependency is textbook addiction. Your sister needs help, not support in those actions.", "NTA. Maybe report it to the police, so she learns that it's not OK? Since she won't learn that from y'alls parents.", "NTA she stole from you she should feel bad and your parents owe you the money your minor sister stole", "> She started crying and said she didn't realise it was to take my cat to the vet, and she was stupid and I shouldn't make her feel even worse about it.\n\nGive her a round of applause and a small gold statuette for her performance. \n\nThen remind her that she's responsible for prolonging your cats ongoing suffering.\n\nNTA", "NTA - And wtf is up with your parents? Who cares if she knew or not. Why aren't they upset about the theft regardless?\n\nETA - She's a minor  which means they are responsible for her debts. Your parents need to pay you back.", "NTA\n\nYou need to get out of that house as soon as possible.\n\nYour parents' reaction says a lot.", "I imagine that you\u2019re afraid that if you talk to your parents about how much she smokes, you\u2019ll get shut down too. Do it anyways; you\u2019re not far from legal age. \n\nSecond, if your parents are backing her, then why can\u2019t they give you the money needed for the appointment now instead of waiting? ESH- there were better solutions than screaming that she\u2019s at fault for his health.", "NTA for saying what you did, but you and your family are the TA for standing by while a 16 year old smokes excessive amounts of weed and steals. She has a serious problem and no one seems to care.", "NTA. She shouldn't have touched it to begin with no matter what it was for. IT IS CALLED STEALING. Explain to your parents that your sister stealing is wrong no matter what and maybe they need to explain that to her. They also need to step in on a 16-year-old stealing money to fund her drug habit. What the Hell is wrong with your parents? She'd find a way to pay me back or I'd be filing a police report.", "NTA that's some messed up logic they have. Your parents need to pay you that money as they are responsible for her. And she shouldn't of stolen it no matter what.", "\"its ok to steal money bc she didnt know what it was for\" your parents are idiots", "NTA   She will learn not to just take someone's money. Obviously now hopeful she will assume that stealiing money could do some harm.", "NTA but you parents are since they see that their 16 year old has a drug problem and haven't put her in rehab.", "NTA whether she knew or not a 16 year old is old enough to know better", "NTA.  She's trying to push the blame. Regardless what it was for, she stole your money.  You need to talk to her about her drug problem as well, because when you start stealing its a problem. Your parents need to open their eyes and intervene before things get worse.", "And the parents are ok with it too?? Like WTF???", "Maybe we now know who sister is hitting the bong with .", "How is the pet neglected when OP was just about to take him to the pet when she found out the money was stolen? Parents should oay for the vet bill for trying to rug sweep. Under developed brain or not, she's 16 and old enough to know better", "Mistake..... making the active choice to steal from your sister is a... mistake.....", "Tbf most people just suck dick for heroin but I totally agree with your point though", "Found the guy who hired Saul.", "19 is in a different place developmentally than 16. The older they get the more complete their development is. A 16 year is more likely to go overboard and develop addictions than a 19 year old.", "That's not what you said though, you said 16 year old shouldn't be using it because her brain hasn't finished developing, neither has 19 year old's, the brain finishes developing around 25, her brain may be more developed but it still isn't even close to finished. I'd actually argue that a 19 year old is more likely to go overboard since they're more independent and more likely to be earning their own money, they're also likely to be earning more since they'd be working more hours therefore they'd have easier and more access. Addiction has 2 factors, environmental causes (self medicating mental illness/trauma/chronic pain for example) and genetic causes (how prone you are to addiction as a whole), genetic components still usually require an environmental trigger though. Even if your brain is fully developed anyone can become prone to addiction based on these 2 factors, even without a genetic component an environmental factor could trigger addiction if it's serious enough. If your issue is with it possibly causing addiction, then you should probably educate yourself more on addiction, because age isn't a major factor if at all. You're right that brain development is affected using it when the brain isn't fully developed, but if that's your main concern then you should also be against OP using it, and you should also be bringing this up when anyone over the legal drinking age but is under 25 is drinking, especially to excess."]}
