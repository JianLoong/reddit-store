We haven't had her long, and we've been playing catch up with her vax/shots, vet exams, and now need the $1,100 to get her fixed (foster didn't get shots done on time and didn't care to get her fixed as a puppy). Add food/toys/basic needs...It gets expensive as all pet owners know. \n\nMy BF doesn't care much to take her for routine visits, and only agreed to get her basic shots/vaxs done. He thinks taking her for boosters/shots/routine visits are a waste of money b/c his parents have never done so and their family dogs lived to good ages. \nHe believes if we breed her, we wouldn't incur any extra costs, and we could sell the pups to good homes. \nI keep telling him no and he doesn't understand that;\n\n1. The pups will need their shots/vaxs done BEFORE being sold. 2. We would most likely need to pay for them to be fixed as well (I'm not for people using dogs to ONLY breed for money) 3. All the xtra dog food/puppy food we would need to pay for. 4. WE BARELY have the space for us, the dog, and 2 cats.  Nvm mind space for 2-8 puppies 5. I would have to vet every applicant bc Im not selling or giving away dogs to just anyone. 6. Even though I work from home, I don't have time for potty training and the time for basic training.\n\nHe keeps bringing up breeding her w/ other good looking dogs & making beautiful puppies that would be the best and have her peesonality; and I just get mad. I keep telling him we barely have the money for her vet visits/shots/getting her fixed and he says he wouldn't have to get the puppies vaxed/fixed and just sell/give them away.

He doesn't care If she's locked in her cage for hours on end. We both went to diff locations and he was back in the area (20 mins down the st @ friend's house) and didn't bother driving over (or asking the friend to take a diff route that passes our home) to let her out, stretch, go pee, and feed her.\nI got home almost 3 hrs after him, and stood home to take care of her and spend time with her while he stood out for another 4 hours. We fought bc I just wanted him to stop home for 15-20 mins to take care of her. That's all. I wasn't asking him to come home & stay.\n\nThis is my first actual dog and this is something we are butting heads on, and I just want to know if AITA in this situation.\n\nETA: This is NOT $ based, he wants a puppy just like our dog", "created_utc": 1667266068, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiv01e/aita_bc_of_not_wanting_to_breed_my_dog/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some dogs need c-sections, which cost thousands of dollars. Plus, it's exhausting. You need to take time off from work, you need to to supervise and socialize and market the puppies. If your lovely dog dies as a result of whelping (a thing that happens), or isn't in to being a mama dog (which also happens), you get to hand raise a litter of puppies.\n\nIn order to legally keep a dog registered in most cities, you need to keep their rabies vaccines up to date.

Further more, cease any and all discussions about the breeding process (ie how and when it has to happen is very specific, lets not educate him) \n\nDepending on where you live, I would start reaching out to various animal rescue agencies and see if anyone is willing to help you get that dog in to be spayed ASAP. I'm stunned that you got the dog from a foster and this was not already taken care of. \n\nLook into SPCA and Humane Society where you live  many of them offer low cost or free spay neuter clinics, they get discounts from vets etc. Ask the agency you got the dog from.Tell them you suspect that your bf will breed the dog even though you have refused if he can figure out how, and it's urgent this be done right away so he can't do that. \n\nYou do not just mix \"good looking dogs\" together at random, as you seem to be aware and the personality transfer is not some guarantee. \n\nLitters are EXPENSIVE. The number of puppies can be huge depending on the breed, there are all sorts of costs involved, and while you don't have to have them fixed before selling them (in fact at 8 weeks of age that's way too young for any dog) you are correct that you would have significant vet fees. That's all assuming that things go well, the mom doesn't get mastitis, pyometra, the puppies don't contract parvo, they don't starve because mom can't supply enough etc. \n\nStand your ground on this, and don't let him take her out. It takes about 10 seconds for a pair of dogs to tie (the start of the breeding) assuming it's the right timing, and by then it's too late. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me directly and I will provide any support I can to assist you, whether that means helping you find a place that will get this dog vetted and altered, or whatever else is needed.", "NTA\n\nThere are a LOT of puppies already without homes, unfortunately and not all of them have good outcomes.

It can very easily go badly and pregnant animals require notably more care. For blindingly obvious reasons.\n\nYour BF is a terrible dog owner.", "That's completely irresponsible.  The world does not need more dogs. There are enough dogs to go around to anyone who wants a dog, and then some. The rest of the dogs just suffer on the streets.

First, there is no guarantee that the puppies would have their mom's looks, temperament, or intelligence. \n\nPoint out to him that animal shelters are full of dogs that need homes.

Me and my husband have two female dogs. One of them is a rare breed around here. We've been asked for puppies plenty of times, and offered alit of $ for a puppy from her and we both refuse. Our dogs are spayed. We will not participate in backyard breeding! The shelters are overflowing as it is.", "NTA - she is a mixed (mutt) , it wouldn't matter what kind of dog you breed her with; you don't know what the puppies will look like OR what their personalities would be. Buy your BF a book on genetics for dogs.", "NTA technically, but kind of e.s.h. You are right, of course, that you should not breed your dog for the very valid reasons you listed. I have a purebred dog I love more than I can express. I briefly considered breeding her because I\u2019d like to have one of her babies. I didn\u2019t because at the end of the day I knew I could never guarantee with any certainty that every single one would be in a home that met my standards. I couldn\u2019t guarantee to my satisfaction that none of them would suffer because of crappy humans. So I was over that passing thought fairly quickly. Maybe that would help convince your SO.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m not sure either of you should have gotten a dog to begin with and it sounds like both of you, but him in particular, need to do better. I\u2019m not just talking about the financial aspect, it sounds like you both have very different ideas about what owning a dog means and need to get on the same page about expectations and care. You shouldn\u2019t be considering another dog though, the first one maybe wasn\u2019t the wisest choice tbh. I don\u2019t mean to be harsh, that\u2019s just how this post reads.\n\nEdit: What will you both do if something worse happens? One of my dogs is epileptic, he didn\u2019t start getting seizures until he was four. Every two weeks I wake up insanely early on a Friday and I take him to the vet for his treatments. He\u2019s such a common face there, everyone recognizes him, and usually the receptionist has a treat ready for him. I don\u2019t even have to leash him, it\u2019s so routine he just steps on the scale and heads to the back all on his own. Is this the way I thought owning him would be? Nope, but it\u2019s just part of life. These things come up and you adjust, but it doesn\u2019t seem like you guys would be able to adjust to such a thing. Just something to consider.", "Get that dog fixed right away.  Call around to your local shelters and see if they can hook you up with a place that will do a spay for someone on a budget. A spay should cost a couple hundred dollars, not a thousand. \n\nAlso your boyfriend is being wildly irresponsible about this dog. \n\nNTA. \n\nWhen I got my cat I called the county animal shelter and asked they gave me a coupon for twenty five dollars to get him neutered at one of three local vets. Don\u2019t hesitate to play up how limited your budget is. You\u2019re being a **responsible** dog owner by getting your dog fixed.", "NTA. He can\u2019t afford to care for the pup properly, keeps her locked up, skimps on shots and wants more dogs? That\u2019s careless.", "NTA. Your boyfriend sounds like someone who \\*shouldn't\\* be allowed to own a pet.

There would have been four otherwise, but if we had waited even a few more hours to take her to the vet she would have died and so would all the puppies. One of the baby boys was born with a club foot and allergies and is basically autistic and the other is the epitome of a perfect lab.

However, if the goal was to have a litter of puppies and sell a few to recoup costs, we failed utterly. I love my boys. There are nights when I\u2019m sure I can only sleep because I use one of them as a feet warmer because he\u2019s essentially a weighted blanket. I am more sensitive to the special needs of others because I have a dog with a limp who can\u2019t walk long distances.
