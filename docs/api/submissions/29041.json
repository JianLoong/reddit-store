Some background info: When I was I child, I went through an incredibly traumatic event. Due to this trauma, I can NOT stand the sound/sight of people crying. If someone just sniffles a bit and has a couple tears, then I\u2019m ok. However, if someone breaks down sobbing, it can cause panic attacks/flashbacks. Sally is fully aware of this, but she never really seemed to take it seriously. She\u2019s not a very emotional person, so this fact has never caused an issue until now.\n\nA few days ago, Sally came over to my house unannounced. She frantically told me that her beloved dog of 13 years passed away. She then started heavily crying and latched onto me for support. I completely froze, pushed her off of me and told her that I can\u2019t be around her right now. I went into the bathroom and sat on the floor in order to calm down. Sally continued to cry/scream at me through the door and called me a scumbag! She then left and is currently giving me the silent treatment. I feel like a horrible partner because I wasn\u2019t there when my GF needed me, but I don\u2019t mean to be inconsiderate.

Emotional support is part of a relationship, a part that you aren't able to give, so you either need a partner who doesn't need it, or you need to get to a place where you can provide it.\n\nLike if you had a similar response to physical touch, the solution would be to find a partner with a similar aversion, not to tell a partner who needs it tough luck", "You're childfree and intend to stay that way, right?", "I guess my question is, why are you in a long term relationship if you are unable to provide support to your partner in a crisis?\n\nIt\u2019s great for you that Sally isn\u2019t much of a crier. But it\u2019s simply naive and shortsighted to believe that it\u2019s possible to have a long term relationship with a partner who will never need emotional support in an emergency situation. Life is unpredictable; people die or get sick, get fired, lose family members, experience violence, etc etc etc\u2026..it\u2019s inevitable human behavior that sometimes everyone will need to have a cry when they are really upset. I think if you haven\u2019t been working on how to handle this specifically with a therapist then YTA. \n\nPoor Sally. What has been a theoretical issue for two years has suddenly become a very real problem at exactly the moment when she doesn\u2019t have the emotional resources to understand it. You should have been doing more to prepare the both of you for this.", "Reading some of the comments I see you said that you are in therapy for this trigger and what happened to you that caused this trigger. My question is, have you and your therapist talked about how to cope with this while in a relationship? People get sad and cry. Stuff happens and they cry. Are you just, never going to ever comfort your partners, whomever they are?\n\nI understand being a situation where something triggers you, I really do. But how can you be in an adult relationship if every time someone cries you just... dip? I'm sorry to say this, but I would not want to continue to be in a relationship with a man who I knew was never going to be emotionally available or able to comfort me if I'm upset. And I don't mean every little thing either, but major stressors. What if one of her parents die (just an example so if they aren't alive or NC choose another major stressor)? You won't be there for her while she's grieving?\n\nNTA for having experienced a trauma/having triggers as a result of said trauma.. and you are in therapy which demonstrates that you are trying to move past it. But a soft YTA because I just can't see how you can be in a serious, long-term adult relationship without being able to be there for your significant other.", "INFO: It doesn't sound like you tried any coping mechanisms when it happened, you just shut down and went away? In your years of therapy did you not discuss this and how to handle it when it comes up? \n\nIf you aren't actively trying to find ways to cope after years then you aren't going to therapy for THIS you're just going to Therapy. \n\nThis should be a wakeup call that what you're doing isn't enough and you need to make a choice about how to proceed.", "Tbh YTA for being in a relationship when you aren't mentally ready, having a partner means supporting them through hard times, drying their tears and helping them calm down. You need more time in therapy to find a proper way to address a relationship before you hurt any other girl who gets pushed away when they need help the most.", "What have you done in the last 3 decades to address this trauma? Are you in counselling?", "YTA get some therapy, crying is a very common occurance and while it's fully valid that it is a trigger for you, if it  has been a trigger since childhood then you absolutely should be getting therapy (should have already done it probably) so that you are capable of emotionally supporting people when they need it. you may not want kids, but if you ever want to be in a healthy relationship you will need to be able to handle the other person crying sometimes.", "Kinda of YTA you say you've been in therapy for this for years and yet you have no coping mechanism or ability to comfort your partner who is this upset and instead you PUSH HER AWAY? and tell her you can't deal with her? \n\nDude come on, if you can't comfort your partner when they are upset you shouldn't even be in a relationship. It doesn't matter that you didn't mean to be inconsiderate, your girlfriend shouldn't have to deal with your triggers.", "Bruh how do you expect to make a relationship work if you can't be around her when she's crying. \n\nYeah, YTA. It sucks that you have issues, but it's also your responsibilty to work on them so that they don't ruin your relationship.", "Soft YTA. You\u2019re 34. Go get therapy and sort yourself out because a major part of adult relationships is being able to support each other in times of crisis.", "Yta. Not on purpose but you\u2019re a \u201cbad\u201d partner. You can\u2019t fulfill the basic roles of emotional support and thus aren\u2019t ready to be in an adult relationship. This is a harsh judgement, but it is the truth. \n\nYou need to go to therapy bc shutting down and saying, \u201ctrauma,\u201d isn\u2019t a valid excuse nor is acceptable when your partner needs you.", "NTA for your trigger and trauma. But sorry, YTA and shouldn't be in long-term committed relationships tbh. If your GF leaves you, it's probably better for her. If your current therapist isn't working, get a new one. No one should be in a relationship with you, or rather, you should not be the one pursuing a relationship until you have your shit fixed and addressed where you can provide emotional support and comfort to a prospective partner. The world doesn't revolve around you. If you can't get it together, don't waste other people's time and energy with trying to lure them into a relationship with you knowing you can't contribute healthily to one.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry, but you really, really need to work through this. Your life partner, friends, family and ESPECIALLY any children in your life are GOING to cry, sometimes uncontrollably. It\u2019s a fact you\u2019re going to have to come to terms with, and the fact that you can\u2019t says you\u2019re not ready for a life partner.", "You need a therapist.", "why are you in a relationship when you know this is a trigger for you? do you expect her to never cry? was she made aware of this fact before the relationship got serious?\n\nYTA", "You can\u2019t help that you experienced trauma but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is supposed to work around it. This will not be the last time a close loved one needs support or cries in front of you. You need to be in therapy to work through this. \n\nYTA\u2026sorry", "YTA, you should have been dealing with your triggers long time ago. Others can be understanding but you have become a shitty partner if you require your partner in their time of grief to cater to your triggers", "INFO:  In the 2 years you've been with Sally, have you never discussed your childhood trauma or this particular trigger with her?", "You shouldn't be in a relationship at all if that's how you respond to someone being upset.\n\nWe are all humans, we all have emotions including being sad and upset.. especially if a pet/someone dies. If you can't handle being there for your partner through these things/hard times.. then you shouldn't be with a partner and you should be deeply working on yourself to get to the point where you can.\n\nShe now knows that she can't rely on you when she needs you. Don't be surprised when she does in fact break it off. No ine wants to be stuck with a partner who can't support them through the hard shit.\n\nAnd definitely.. never, ever have kids.\n\nYTA, but I think you know that already.", "YTA. Pushing someone away while they are crying is awful.", "Sally needs someone who is more emotionally stable and able to be there for her emotionally.  You are not a horrible partner, you are just not the one for her.", "YTA people crying is a normal part of life and it's excessive that it's a trigger for you. You're responsible for seeking help with this. You treated your girlfriend like shit during an emotional time and that's not right. There's no excuse for this.", "YTA because your needs can't erase hers. If you're intolerance to cries and tears is that bad you should have thought of a way to handle those situations before, you can't seriously expect you gf to never cry, even if not very emotional she is still human. It's your trauma so it's your job to handle it, you should have planned and discussed it ahead with her.", "This hard but I will echo a soft YTA.\nIt is a trigger and you say you're in therapy.\nHas it been the same therapist this whole time?\nIf so, you may need to switch it up and/or getting a second opinion. That's a long time to have a trigger reaction like that. \nIf you're intending on being in relationships and have children, the sobbing crying is going to happen. \nIt wouldn't be fair for you to be absent, unavailable and unsupportive in those moments like now. \nAn adult may understand those triggers, but a child will not.", "YTA god damn this was awful to read. You can't be in a relationship if you can't emotionally support someone. Crying is HEALTHY, and any therapist will tell you this. Supporting your partner when they're going through something heavy enough to make them cry is a a very base minimum for any relationship. It is literally the least you can do. If you can't do this, you should be single until you can work through your trauma enough with a licensed therapist to provide emotional support to your future partner. Wtf did I just read.", "YTA. You're emotionally incapable of having a serious relationship. Your gf should leave you and move on.", "YTA \n\nIf you seriously pushed your distraught partner off you and went off to hide from her you suck so hard. You're an adult. Get therapy.", "I say YTA as you said this was a one time occurrence and was something that really hurts her. You pushed her off you and locked yourself away as she was crying that just I couldn\u2019t imagine how hurtful that had to be for her. You need to figure better therapy if what you have been doing hasn\u2019t made much progress. This is something that is just hard to handle what is your plans? Do you want to have children in the future or what\u2019s your plan with being in a long term commitment because honestly you could not with having trauma such as this. Kids cry over many things small especially and a partner would have to sign up to never seek help emotionally with you. You recognize you have trauma and am in therapy but there\u2019s needs to be more change or figuring out what is needed to help you.", "You should not be in any relationship where you will be needed for emotional support. You are neglectful of others\u2019 needs. PLEASE don\u2019t have children!", "NAH, but you\u2019re kind of on the verge of being a soft AH.\n\nObviously a traumatic event is an understandable reaction to have a trigger like that, but, you\u2019re probably going to have to address it either through professional help or some other means, or situations like this will keep happening.\n\nLike, I can\u2019t imagine this would be the last time Sally cries and it would be rather unfair and unrealistic to expect her to NEVER cry near you. Today, it was her dog, but what if say in a few years it\u2019s one of her parents, or she just has a terrible day for whatever reason and can\u2019t keep it together and needs your support? It\u2019s clear she wants your support in a devastating moment for her, and if you outright REFUSE to even be in the same room for it, you will probably be single. How would you feel if you were in a vulnerable moment and she reacted that way towards you?", "NAH, but you need to finish therapy, or freaking start.  Learn some coping skills.  Face this head on.\n\nIf you are in a relationship, you WILL be around a crying partner that  WILL need your support.  If you aren't willing to work on this, then you don't deserve a partner long term.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend needs love and support once in your whole relationship. Instead you physically push her off of you, lock yourself in another room, and focus on your own needs instead of being there for her as she begs you for basic empathy. Her reaction at the death of a beloved pet is justified and normal; your reaction to her need for comfort and connection is not normal for someone you're supposed to care about. \n\nYou can be loving and supportive without physically being there for her, but you can also be uncomfortable temporarily to comfort someone you care about.", "Honestly you're not the AH for your response perse but you are the AH for being in a relationship in the first place. This is something that really should have been worked through before you entered a relationship and if therapy hasn't worked by now then you need to switch therapsists....I can't even imagine the hurt I would feel if my husband shoved me off of him and left as I was sobbing with grief. I get it that you told her you don't deal well with crying/you have trauma but did you explicitly tell her that you will literally run out of the room should she ever start crying more heavily than a sniffle? If not then YTAH. If someone told me they don't deal well with crying, my assumption would be that they maybe feel a bit uncomfortable and don't know what to say or do. But not that they will literally abandon me. If she dumps you then I suggest not considering another relationship until you are in a better place. It's not fair to let your trauma effect someone else's life as almost everyone has moments where they cry and need support from their partner.", "YTA unfortunately, but I sympathize with you. But if you're in a serious relationship, you're going to need to find a way to offer your partner comfort when they're upset the same way they would you.", "YTA, even if it\u2019s something you can\u2019t completely control. \n\nShe just lost her companion of 13 years. That is *devastating*. She needed you. I get that you have triggers but sometimes you have to push through to be there for someone you love.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou cannot expect any relationship, romantic or platonic, to be tear free. Humans are social creatures, we rely on others for emotional support. Romantic partners NEED this support.  No one expects you to allow yourself to have a panic attack just to provide support for your partner, BUT you absolutely should be taking every step you can to limit your triggers so that you can actually be an emotionally supportive partner. I cannot fathom how your girlfriend must feel right now, I would be devastated if my partner reacted this way. I can empathize, but you are responsible for how you react to things and how much effort you have put into healing yourself. \n\nYou say you've had therapy over the years, but are you currently in therapy? Therapy should not have stopped of you still have no coping mechanisms for your PTSD. Therapy should provide you with new tools on how to manage your triggers and break behavior that reinforces poor coping. If you ARE in therapy, you need to try a different therapist or different therapy techniques, such as EDMR therapy. \n\nI have severe PTSD from multiple sexual assaults and abuse.  I have so many triggers. I had therapists who did not help me with coping. Finally found one that did--dont ever stop searching til you find one who truly helps you. I went from having multiple panic attacks daily, touch avoidant, social anxiety and night terrors. Now I almost never have any of that--my triggers still cause anxiety and panic attacks, but they are rare. I can also talk myself down from them now if I start to spiral. I know it is a hard process, but you can improve your response to triggers, not saying it will be perfect but you absolutely can improve. \n\nApologize to your gf and seek out new therapy techniques. I wish you both the best. I hope you can heal from your trauma and my heart goes out to your gf for losing her dog.", "YTA. You need to figure out your shit before even attempting to be in a relationship. Your can\u2019t provide emotional support or even stay calm in any situation where someone is crying. What has your therapist said about coping mechanisms? Is your plan for the rest of your life to just run away? Does that sound like partner material? What happens when your in public and a stranger is crying/there is an emergency? It\u2019s unfortunate but your unreliable and undependable and your GF needed you. If I were her I would 100% end the relationship. I strongly encourage you to get a new therapist, and keep searching for ways to be able to deal with your trama- and to stay single until you figure it out.", "YTA. You sound like my dad.", "I wouldn't say you're TA for having the issues you do.  But if you value this woman and want a future with her, or with most anyone, then you'll probably have to figure out how to deal with this.  Whether that's more therapy or different therapists, or even if it's a \"fake it until you make it\" type of thing.", "It\u2019s time for EMDR (and if that doesn\u2019t work, definitely a vasectomy)", "How dare she try to cry on your shoulders. She ain\u2019t shit! (JK, get therapy)", "You need theraphy.", "YTA for not adequately dealing with your trauma. It's a shitty hand to be dealt, and it's not your fault that you've been dealt it. But if you plan to be a part of adult relationships, you need to be capable of dealing with situations like this for your partner. It's not good enough to just flee the room and be unavailable. You likely need to seek therapy in a more serious way than you might have done in the past.", "I'm sorry, but YTA. You not an AH for being damaged by trauma. But you really are one for being a lousy partner. You GF is emotionally devistated, and you locked yourself in the bathroom when she really, really needed you. You are a grown man, and you should really engage in effective therapy. You say you've been in therapy, but it clearly hasn't worked. This may well be the message your GF needs to tell her that you can't provide the emotional support she needs.", "Honestly, yeah yta. Not because you have a trigger and or need space, because you expect your girlfriend to just. Not cry? \"She knows this trigger but doesn't take it seriously, she's very emotional\" yeah??? She's allowed to have and express her emotions and it's pretty normal to rely on your partner for emotional support. You have a very very broad trigger that you can't expect every one around you to cater to. It sounds like you need some intensive fear exposure therapy. I'm sorry that you have such a broad trigger, but it's something like Occupational Therapy that you need because it's something that will impact your daily life. Your girlfriend is not the problem, You have the problem. Yes, she should be there and support you through stuff like this but you can't expect to just be around someone and never see them cry", "Soft YTA. I\u2019m sorry for your trauma but in the inability to have healed you might have unintentionally caused her trauma. By locking yourself in the bathroom while she was at her absolute lowest point when she needed you the most you were not there for her. She will never be able to forget this, regardless of how you both move forward.", "NTA, but YTA if you\u2019re not doing anything to try helping with that trigger. \n\ncrying is a normal human reaction, especially to loss. unless you wish to have a robot partner and robot friends, there are times where people are going to cry in your presence and may even need your support. it\u2019s only fair if you want them to do that for you. \n\nit\u2019s very clear your partner was acting out of pure, charged emotions, but i also can\u2019t blame her for the core feeling of being emotionally neglected because she needed you and you didn\u2019t pull through. \n\ni\u2019d suggest both individual therapy and couple\u2019s therapy because this situation is a little complicated. you *are not* the asshole for having this trigger, your trauma is valid, but you *do* need to put in some work about the trigger and see how things can work with your partner. as someone who\u2019s experienced trauma and has their own triggers, it is up to *you* to handle them and create your own foundation to uphold your end of a relationship. it\u2019d be kind of ridiculous to expect a human being *never* to cry.", "YTA , Your situation sucks but you shouldn't have started a relationship until you were able to forfill the most basic and important obligations of being a partner.\n\nThere isn't any way to sugar coat this - what use is a partner who cannot be there when you need them most?\n\nBeing in a relationship is a privilege and a responsibility, and you were grossly derelict in your responsibility. The fact that you don't choose to be is neither here nor there - your partner deserves better. It's not about you.", "Go to therapy Yta", "YTA. It\u2019s ok to be triggered and have this kind of reaction, but it is also your responsibility to heal your childhood trauma if it is so severe that you cannot support your girlfriend when something serious happens like her dog dies. Healing those childhood wounds will not only help your relationship but will help you cope with whatever else life is going to throw at you. If you are already working on this then bring this to therapy and see how you can work through it. If therapy isn\u2019t helping try something else like emdr, meditation. Figure out a way to desensitize yourself to crying if you can - watch movies, pay an actor to cry in front of you. Show your partner you are working on trying to improve this and apologize to her. That will go a long way.", "I'm not sure u should be in a relationship. Maybe work on yourself first.", "YTA for starting and wanting to continue a long term relationship without further therapy. In a relationship walking away from your partner when they are distressed and in need of support is not acceptable behaviour. I do not know if children featured in your ideal future or not but again, you should not enter into parenthood if you do not intend on supporting your children emotionally.", "YTA and I feel incredibly sorry for your girlfriend. You didn't even *explain* anything in that situation, you literally pushed her away and told her you can't be around her ... That's cruel. *Her dog died.* I doubt she had the mental capability to understand what was going on and piece it all together herself.\n\nYes, it's hard for you as well but don't make your problems her problems. Get therapy or find a compromise for whenever she truly needs you because right now all you've taught her is that she cannot count on you - but rather be appaled by her needing support.", "Very soft YTA, OP.\n\nTrauma is a horrible thing to have to deal with and I can completely sympathize with you and what causes your triggers. Truly, I know how hard it is for you to have a trigger that's something most people can handle just fine. It sucks. \n\nThat being said, your trigger is, for the vast majority of the rest of us, a completely normal and healthy response. You cannot police another person's emotional response to the point of demanding they never cry in front of you. That is an awful thing to require of your partner. \n\nHonestly, you shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone until you've dealt with this completely. What you are requiring of partners, not crying in front of you regardless of the situation, isn't tenable and is wildly unhealthy not just for you, but for the person you're with.

Your gf was more than justified in breaking down after her dog died.\n\nThe main person you're the AH to here is yourself. If you've been in therapy and it's not helping, you need to try new therapies or a different therapist. You're triggered by one of the most common things other people will do, and that needs addressed ASAP.\n\nYou were a \"bad\" bf in this situation, and while trauma certainly doesn't heal overnight, you've had 15+ years to work on it, at least enough to be functional.", "Yes yta.

Some background info: When I was I child, I went through an incredibly traumatic event. Due to this trauma, I can NOT stand the sound/sight of people crying. If someone just sniffles a bit and has a couple tears, then I\u2019m ok. However, if someone breaks down sobbing, it can cause panic attacks/flashbacks. Sally is fully aware of this, but she never really seemed to take it seriously. She\u2019s not a very emotional person, so this fact has never caused an issue until now.\n\nA few days ago, Sally came over to my house unannounced. She frantically told me that her beloved dog of 13 years passed away. She then started heavily crying and latched onto me for support. I completely froze, pushed her off of me and told her that I can\u2019t be around her right now. I went into the bathroom and sat on the floor in order to calm down. Sally continued to cry/scream at me through the door and called me a scumbag! She then left and is currently giving me the silent treatment. I feel like a horrible partner because I wasn\u2019t there when my GF needed me, but I don\u2019t mean to be inconsiderate. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But your trauma can NOT lead your life.", "People go through emotions, that\u2019s human. If you have trauma over tears you should not be in a relationship where your SO will need your emotional support from time to time. Your relationships should be more limited or superficial until therapy works well enough for you that you can handle or want to handle being emotionally supportive to a partner when they have a need. YTA for not recognizing this and for thinking just bc you told her of your trauma meant that she should shelter you from needing you. This is how emotional affairs might pop up in your future as you close your partner\u2019s off to relying on you as a partner. Please take care of yourself first before your next relationship, good luck with that.", "YTA. When you're in a romantic relationship with someone, you should be able to support them during the worst times of their life and vice versa. You are not capable of that. You should have been clear to her and all your future partners about this.

I don't know how you can be in a healthy relationship if you check out like this. It just isn't fair for the other person that you can only handle the good times. \n\nI don't think you were as honest to her about your triggers as you should have been. Were you vague and said you couldn't handle it, or did you paint a clear picture for her that you will literally abandon her in dire moments, thus making things worse? That she will have to go to funerals and hospitals alone? That she can not even come home to you for comfort? \n\nIt's clear you know that this is your problem to overcome, but I don't think it's clear to you that you are unfairly forcing your romantic partners to handle hardships in life without you.

First let me say I\u2019m really sorry that you went through such a traumatic thing when you were younger.\n\nSecond off, people do expect to be comforted when they\u2019re going through something traumatic themselves.

You just went into this hoping she would never display any serious emotions or trauma herself? You\u2019re an adult and you need to take some time to yourself to sort your issues out because you are NOT in a space where you can be a good partner, despite you wanting to be.

You should seek therapy to address this issue.  Obviously, this is not the last time a loved one/long term partner is going to cry/experience a loss.

You can know what coping mechanisms you need, what is the trauma and how to accept it, the cognitive and behavioral approaches you can take.  It is just when it comes down to it nothing helps.  No matter how many therapists or psychologists, the approaching it takes, nothing works.  If she can accept this break up and find someone who will.
