Some background info: When I was I child, I went through an incredibly traumatic event. Due to this trauma, I can NOT stand the sound/sight of people crying. If someone just sniffles a bit and has a couple tears, then I\u2019m ok. However, if someone breaks down sobbing, it can cause panic attacks/flashbacks. Sally is fully aware of this, but she never really seemed to take it seriously. She\u2019s not a very emotional person, so this fact has never caused an issue until now.\n\nA few days ago, Sally came over to my house unannounced. She frantically told me that her beloved dog of 13 years passed away. She then started heavily crying and latched onto me for support. I completely froze, pushed her off of me and told her that I can\u2019t be around her right now. I went into the bathroom and sat on the floor in order to calm down. Sally continued to cry/scream at me through the door and called me a scumbag! She then left and is currently giving me the silent treatment. I feel like a horrible partner because I wasn\u2019t there when my GF needed me, but I don\u2019t mean to be inconsiderate.

Emotional support is part of a relationship, a part that you aren't able to give, so you either need a partner who doesn't need it, or you need to get to a place where you can provide it.\n\nLike if you had a similar response to physical touch, the solution would be to find a partner with a similar aversion, not to tell a partner who needs it tough luck", "You're childfree and intend to stay that way, right?", "I guess my question is, why are you in a long term relationship if you are unable to provide support to your partner in a crisis?\n\nIt\u2019s great for you that Sally isn\u2019t much of a crier. But it\u2019s simply naive and shortsighted to believe that it\u2019s possible to have a long term relationship with a partner who will never need emotional support in an emergency situation. Life is unpredictable; people die or get sick, get fired, lose family members, experience violence, etc etc etc\u2026..it\u2019s inevitable human behavior that sometimes everyone will need to have a cry when they are really upset. I think if you haven\u2019t been working on how to handle this specifically with a therapist then YTA. \n\nPoor Sally. What has been a theoretical issue for two years has suddenly become a very real problem at exactly the moment when she doesn\u2019t have the emotional resources to understand it. You should have been doing more to prepare the both of you for this.", "Reading some of the comments I see you said that you are in therapy for this trigger and what happened to you that caused this trigger. My question is, have you and your therapist talked about how to cope with this while in a relationship? People get sad and cry. Stuff happens and they cry. Are you just, never going to ever comfort your partners, whomever they are?\n\nI understand being a situation where something triggers you, I really do. But how can you be in an adult relationship if every time someone cries you just... dip? I'm sorry to say this, but I would not want to continue to be in a relationship with a man who I knew was never going to be emotionally available or able to comfort me if I'm upset. And I don't mean every little thing either, but major stressors. What if one of her parents die (just an example so if they aren't alive or NC choose another major stressor)? You won't be there for her while she's grieving?\n\nNTA for having experienced a trauma/having triggers as a result of said trauma.. and you are in therapy which demonstrates that you are trying to move past it. But a soft YTA because I just can't see how you can be in a serious, long-term adult relationship without being able to be there for your significant other.", "INFO: It doesn't sound like you tried any coping mechanisms when it happened, you just shut down and went away? In your years of therapy did you not discuss this and how to handle it when it comes up? \n\nIf you aren't actively trying to find ways to cope after years then you aren't going to therapy for THIS you're just going to Therapy. \n\nThis should be a wakeup call that what you're doing isn't enough and you need to make a choice about how to proceed.", "Tbh YTA for being in a relationship when you aren't mentally ready, having a partner means supporting them through hard times, drying their tears and helping them calm down. You need more time in therapy to find a proper way to address a relationship before you hurt any other girl who gets pushed away when they need help the most.", "What have you done in the last 3 decades to address this trauma? Are you in counselling?", "YTA get some therapy, crying is a very common occurance and while it's fully valid that it is a trigger for you, if it  has been a trigger since childhood then you absolutely should be getting therapy (should have already done it probably) so that you are capable of emotionally supporting people when they need it. you may not want kids, but if you ever want to be in a healthy relationship you will need to be able to handle the other person crying sometimes.", "Kinda of YTA you say you've been in therapy for this for years and yet you have no coping mechanism or ability to comfort your partner who is this upset and instead you PUSH HER AWAY? and tell her you can't deal with her? \n\nDude come on, if you can't comfort your partner when they are upset you shouldn't even be in a relationship. It doesn't matter that you didn't mean to be inconsiderate, your girlfriend shouldn't have to deal with your triggers.", "Bruh how do you expect to make a relationship work if you can't be around her when she's crying. \n\nYeah, YTA. It sucks that you have issues, but it's also your responsibilty to work on them so that they don't ruin your relationship.", "Soft YTA. You\u2019re 34. Go get therapy and sort yourself out because a major part of adult relationships is being able to support each other in times of crisis.", "Yta. Not on purpose but you\u2019re a \u201cbad\u201d partner. You can\u2019t fulfill the basic roles of emotional support and thus aren\u2019t ready to be in an adult relationship. This is a harsh judgement, but it is the truth. \n\nYou need to go to therapy bc shutting down and saying, \u201ctrauma,\u201d isn\u2019t a valid excuse nor is acceptable when your partner needs you.", "NTA for your trigger and trauma. But sorry, YTA and shouldn't be in long-term committed relationships tbh. If your GF leaves you, it's probably better for her. If your current therapist isn't working, get a new one. No one should be in a relationship with you, or rather, you should not be the one pursuing a relationship until you have your shit fixed and addressed where you can provide emotional support and comfort to a prospective partner. The world doesn't revolve around you. If you can't get it together, don't waste other people's time and energy with trying to lure them into a relationship with you knowing you can't contribute healthily to one.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry, but you really, really need to work through this. Your life partner, friends, family and ESPECIALLY any children in your life are GOING to cry, sometimes uncontrollably. It\u2019s a fact you\u2019re going to have to come to terms with, and the fact that you can\u2019t says you\u2019re not ready for a life partner.", "You need a therapist.", "why are you in a relationship when you know this is a trigger for you? do you expect her to never cry? was she made aware of this fact before the relationship got serious?\n\nYTA", "You can\u2019t help that you experienced trauma but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone is supposed to work around it. This will not be the last time a close loved one needs support or cries in front of you. You need to be in therapy to work through this. \n\nYTA\u2026sorry", "YTA, you should have been dealing with your triggers long time ago. Others can be understanding but you have become a shitty partner if you require your partner in their time of grief to cater to your triggers", "INFO:  In the 2 years you've been with Sally, have you never discussed your childhood trauma or this particular trigger with her?", "You shouldn't be in a relationship at all if that's how you respond to someone being upset.\n\nWe are all humans, we all have emotions including being sad and upset.. especially if a pet/someone dies. If you can't handle being there for your partner through these things/hard times.. then you shouldn't be with a partner and you should be deeply working on yourself to get to the point where you can.\n\nShe now knows that she can't rely on you when she needs you. Don't be surprised when she does in fact break it off. No ine wants to be stuck with a partner who can't support them through the hard shit.\n\nAnd definitely.. never, ever have kids.\n\nYTA, but I think you know that already.", "YTA. Pushing someone away while they are crying is awful.", "Sally needs someone who is more emotionally stable and able to be there for her emotionally.  You are not a horrible partner, you are just not the one for her.", "YTA people crying is a normal part of life and it's excessive that it's a trigger for you. You're responsible for seeking help with this. You treated your girlfriend like shit during an emotional time and that's not right. There's no excuse for this.", "YTA because your needs can't erase hers. If you're intolerance to cries and tears is that bad you should have thought of a way to handle those situations before, you can't seriously expect you gf to never cry, even if not very emotional she is still human. It's your trauma so it's your job to handle it, you should have planned and discussed it ahead with her.", "This hard but I will echo a soft YTA.\nIt is a trigger and you say you're in therapy.\nHas it been the same therapist this whole time?\nIf so, you may need to switch it up and/or getting a second opinion. That's a long time to have a trigger reaction like that. \nIf you're intending on being in relationships and have children, the sobbing crying is going to happen. \nIt wouldn't be fair for you to be absent, unavailable and unsupportive in those moments like now. \nAn adult may understand those triggers, but a child will not.", "YTA god damn this was awful to read. You can't be in a relationship if you can't emotionally support someone. Crying is HEALTHY, and any therapist will tell you this. Supporting your partner when they're going through something heavy enough to make them cry is a a very base minimum for any relationship. It is literally the least you can do. If you can't do this, you should be single until you can work through your trauma enough with a licensed therapist to provide emotional support to your future partner. Wtf did I just read.", "YTA. You're emotionally incapable of having a serious relationship. Your gf should leave you and move on.", "YTA \n\nIf you seriously pushed your distraught partner off you and went off to hide from her you suck so hard. You're an adult. Get therapy.", "I say YTA as you said this was a one time occurrence and was something that really hurts her. You pushed her off you and locked yourself away as she was crying that just I couldn\u2019t imagine how hurtful that had to be for her. You need to figure better therapy if what you have been doing hasn\u2019t made much progress. This is something that is just hard to handle what is your plans? Do you want to have children in the future or what\u2019s your plan with being in a long term commitment because honestly you could not with having trauma such as this. Kids cry over many things small especially and a partner would have to sign up to never seek help emotionally with you. You recognize you have trauma and am in therapy but there\u2019s needs to be more change or figuring out what is needed to help you.", "You should not be in any relationship where you will be needed for emotional support. You are neglectful of others\u2019 needs. PLEASE don\u2019t have children!", "NAH, but you\u2019re kind of on the verge of being a soft AH.\n\nObviously a traumatic event is an understandable reaction to have a trigger like that, but, you\u2019re probably going to have to address it either through professional help or some other means, or situations like this will keep happening.\n\nLike, I can\u2019t imagine this would be the last time Sally cries and it would be rather unfair and unrealistic to expect her to NEVER cry near you. Today, it was her dog, but what if say in a few years it\u2019s one of her parents, or she just has a terrible day for whatever reason and can\u2019t keep it together and needs your support? It\u2019s clear she wants your support in a devastating moment for her, and if you outright REFUSE to even be in the same room for it, you will probably be single. How would you feel if you were in a vulnerable moment and she reacted that way towards you?", "NAH, but you need to finish therapy, or freaking start.  Learn some coping skills.  Face this head on.\n\nIf you are in a relationship, you WILL be around a crying partner that  WILL need your support.  If you aren't willing to work on this, then you don't deserve a partner long term.", "YTA\n\nYour girlfriend needs love and support once in your whole relationship. Instead you physically push her off of you, lock yourself in another room, and focus on your own needs instead of being there for her as she begs you for basic empathy. Her reaction at the death of a beloved pet is justified and normal; your reaction to her need for comfort and connection is not normal for someone you're supposed to care about. \n\nYou can be loving and supportive without physically being there for her, but you can also be uncomfortable temporarily to comfort someone you care about.", "Honestly you're not the AH for your response perse but you are the AH for being in a relationship in the first place. This is something that really should have been worked through before you entered a relationship and if therapy hasn't worked by now then you need to switch therapsists....I can't even imagine the hurt I would feel if my husband shoved me off of him and left as I was sobbing with grief. I get it that you told her you don't deal well with crying/you have trauma but did you explicitly tell her that you will literally run out of the room should she ever start crying more heavily than a sniffle? If not then YTAH. If someone told me they don't deal well with crying, my assumption would be that they maybe feel a bit uncomfortable and don't know what to say or do. But not that they will literally abandon me. If she dumps you then I suggest not considering another relationship until you are in a better place. It's not fair to let your trauma effect someone else's life as almost everyone has moments where they cry and need support from their partner.", "YTA unfortunately, but I sympathize with you. But if you're in a serious relationship, you're going to need to find a way to offer your partner comfort when they're upset the same way they would you.", "YTA, even if it\u2019s something you can\u2019t completely control. \n\nShe just lost her companion of 13 years. That is *devastating*. She needed you. I get that you have triggers but sometimes you have to push through to be there for someone you love.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou cannot expect any relationship, romantic or platonic, to be tear free. Humans are social creatures, we rely on others for emotional support. Romantic partners NEED this support.  \n\nNo one expects you to allow yourself to have a panic attack just to provide support for your partner, BUT you absolutely should be taking every step you can to limit your triggers so that you can actually be an emotionally supportive partner. You are responsible for how you react to things and how much effort you have put into healing yourself, and the lack thereof is what makes YTA.\n\nYou say you've had therapy over the years, but are you currently in therapy? Therapy should not have stopped if you still have no coping mechanisms for your PTSD. Therapy should provide you with new tools on how to manage your triggers and break behavior that reinforces poor coping. If you ARE in therapy, you need to try a different therapist or different therapy techniques, such as EDMR therapy. \n\nI know it is a hard process, but you can improve your response to triggers, not saying it will be perfect but you absolutely can improve. \n\nApologize to your gf and seek out new therapy techniques. I wish you both the best. I hope you can heal from your trauma and my heart goes out to your gf for losing her dog.", "YTA. You need to figure out your shit before even attempting to be in a relationship. Your can\u2019t provide emotional support or even stay calm in any situation where someone is crying. What has your therapist said about coping mechanisms? Is your plan for the rest of your life to just run away? Does that sound like partner material? What happens when your in public and a stranger is crying/there is an emergency? It\u2019s unfortunate but your unreliable and undependable and your GF needed you. If I were her I would 100% end the relationship. I strongly encourage you to get a new therapist, and keep searching for ways to be able to deal with your trama- and to stay single until you figure it out.", "YTA. You sound like my dad.", "I wouldn't say you're TA for having the issues you do.  But if you value this woman and want a future with her, or with most anyone, then you'll probably have to figure out how to deal with this.  Whether that's more therapy or different therapists, or even if it's a \"fake it until you make it\" type of thing.", "It\u2019s time for EMDR (and if that doesn\u2019t work, definitely a vasectomy)", "How dare she try to cry on your shoulders. She ain\u2019t shit! (JK, get therapy)", "You need theraphy.", "YTA for not adequately dealing with your trauma. It's a shitty hand to be dealt, and it's not your fault that you've been dealt it. But if you plan to be a part of adult relationships, you need to be capable of dealing with situations like this for your partner. It's not good enough to just flee the room and be unavailable. You likely need to seek therapy in a more serious way than you might have done in the past.", "I'm sorry, but YTA. You not an AH for being damaged by trauma. But you really are one for being a lousy partner. You GF is emotionally devistated, and you locked yourself in the bathroom when she really, really needed you. You are a grown man, and you should really engage in effective therapy. You say you've been in therapy, but it clearly hasn't worked. This may well be the message your GF needs to tell her that you can't provide the emotional support she needs.", "Honestly, yeah yta. Not because you have a trigger and or need space, because you expect your girlfriend to just. Not cry? \"She knows this trigger but doesn't take it seriously, she's very emotional\" yeah??? She's allowed to have and express her emotions and it's pretty normal to rely on your partner for emotional support. You have a very very broad trigger that you can't expect every one around you to cater to. It sounds like you need some intensive fear exposure therapy. I'm sorry that you have such a broad trigger, but it's something like Occupational Therapy that you need because it's something that will impact your daily life. Your girlfriend is not the problem, You have the problem. Yes, she should be there and support you through stuff like this but you can't expect to just be around someone and never see them cry", "Soft YTA. I\u2019m sorry for your trauma but in the inability to have healed you might have unintentionally caused her trauma. By locking yourself in the bathroom while she was at her absolute lowest point when she needed you the most you were not there for her. She will never be able to forget this, regardless of how you both move forward.", "NTA, but YTA if you\u2019re not doing anything to try helping with that trigger. \n\ncrying is a normal human reaction, especially to loss. unless you wish to have a robot partner and robot friends, there are times where people are going to cry in your presence and may even need your support. it\u2019s only fair if you want them to do that for you. \n\nit\u2019s very clear your partner was acting out of pure, charged emotions, but i also can\u2019t blame her for the core feeling of being emotionally neglected because she needed you and you didn\u2019t pull through. \n\ni\u2019d suggest both individual therapy and couple\u2019s therapy because this situation is a little complicated. you *are not* the asshole for having this trigger, your trauma is valid, but you *do* need to put in some work about the trigger and see how things can work with your partner. as someone who\u2019s experienced trauma and has their own triggers, it is up to *you* to handle them and create your own foundation to uphold your end of a relationship. it\u2019d be kind of ridiculous to expect a human being *never* to cry.", "YTA , Your situation sucks but you shouldn't have started a relationship until you were able to forfill the most basic and important obligations of being a partner.\n\nThere isn't any way to sugar coat this - what use is a partner who cannot be there when you need them most?\n\nBeing in a relationship is a privilege and a responsibility, and you were grossly derelict in your responsibility. The fact that you don't choose to be is neither here nor there - your partner deserves better. It's not about you.", "Go to therapy Yta", "YTA. It\u2019s ok to be triggered and have this kind of reaction, but it is also your responsibility to heal your childhood trauma if it is so severe that you cannot support your girlfriend when something serious happens like her dog dies. Healing those childhood wounds will not only help your relationship but will help you cope with whatever else life is going to throw at you. If you are already working on this then bring this to therapy and see how you can work through it. If therapy isn\u2019t helping try something else like emdr, meditation. Figure out a way to desensitize yourself to crying if you can - watch movies, pay an actor to cry in front of you. Show your partner you are working on trying to improve this and apologize to her. That will go a long way.", "I'm not sure u should be in a relationship. Maybe work on yourself first.", "YTA for starting and wanting to continue a long term relationship without further therapy. In a relationship walking away from your partner when they are distressed and in need of support is not acceptable behaviour. I do not know if children featured in your ideal future or not but again, you should not enter into parenthood if you do not intend on supporting your children emotionally.", "YTA and I feel incredibly sorry for your girlfriend. You didn't even *explain* anything in that situation, you literally pushed her away and told her you can't be around her ... That's cruel. *Her dog died.* I doubt she had the mental capability to understand what was going on and piece it all together herself.\n\nYes, it's hard for you as well but don't make your problems her problems. Get therapy or find a compromise for whenever she truly needs you because right now all you've taught her is that she cannot count on you - but rather be appaled by her needing support.", "Very soft YTA, OP.\n\nTrauma is a horrible thing to have to deal with and I can completely sympathize with you and what causes your triggers. Truly, I know how hard it is for you to have a trigger that's something most people can handle just fine. It sucks. \n\nThat being said, your trigger is, for the vast majority of the rest of us, a completely normal and healthy response. You cannot police another person's emotional response to the point of demanding they never cry in front of you. That is an awful thing to require of your partner. \n\nHonestly, you shouldn't be in a relationship with anyone until you've dealt with this completely. What you are requiring of partners, not crying in front of you regardless of the situation, isn't tenable and is wildly unhealthy not just for you, but for the person you're with.

Your gf was more than justified in breaking down after her dog died.\n\nThe main person you're the AH to here is yourself. If you've been in therapy and it's not helping, you need to try new therapies or a different therapist.

He wouldn't even be able to comfort her because he would not be in a good headspace himself. \n\nOp you are NTA, this is not your fault, it's a trauma response, and your trauma is valid. Try to talk to your girlfriend about it and explain why you did what you did.", "NTA, frankly I'm sick of the internet being weighted toward everyone spewing their feely-feelers around all the time. I don't have a similar trauma, but I am neuro divergent and I am just insanely uncomfortable around crying people, especially when they are crying AT me, and I have no idea why other people don't tend to keep that kind of thing private, as I was taught to do. There's nothing wrong with going into another room for a few minutes to compose yourself! I know reddit is going to eat me up too, but I just wanted to show you some solidarity.", "NAH. Sally seems to understand the idea of your boundaries when she is feeling logical, but when her emotions are heightened she loses the ability to see your boundaries as a necessity. I think you need to have her sit down with your therapist and let your therapist explain it to her. This may be a deal breaker for her, but if she has a support system she can use for situations like this it may be manageable. There are people out there who specifically do not cry in front of other people (like me), so keep that in mind if you are on the hunt for another partner in the future.", "NTA, but you should probably work really hard to address this and stay single while you do it. Part of dating is being there for each other, including when someone is breaking down. She should respect your trauma more, but she should also be able to get support from her partner, as should anyone else. If it's a hard line for you that you genuinely CANNOT be around to help or just listen when someone is breaking down.. that's an issue that will follow you through all romantic relationships. You really need to try and deal with that- and maybe, yeah, just don't date in the meantime.", "ESH.\n\nYour GF was aware of your trigger and chose you as her support person (INFO: could anyone else have been emotional support at that moment?) If she truly needs someone who can act as her default emotional support, you guys need to break up until you've been in therapy long enough to handle your trigger. \n\nYou need to consider whether you're really in a place to be dating seriously. My ex was *not*, and it wasn't his fault that he wasn't ready to date, but it *was* his fault that he couldn't buck up and break up with me instead of like, repeatedly hurting me (I eventually broke up with him, much later than I should have).", "Lemme get this straight. Crying triggers you and you also want to be in a relationship with... a woman. Have you met women?", "NTA you told her about this and she didn't take it seriously. You shouldn't have to deal with that becayse she decided to ignore your situation until it affected her. She didn't care when you told her, she should've expected this.

No one should have to push down their trauma for someone else. \n\nThe fact that people assume you aren't doing anything for it like you wanna stay this was just shows how ignorant people are. \n\nYou need to have a serious conversation with her, or your next partner, about this and if they don't treat this serious and have a talk with you about how to handle it in future situations then you shouldn't be in a relationship with them.

Some background info: When I was I child, I went through an incredibly traumatic event. Due to this trauma, I can NOT stand the sound/sight of people crying. If someone just sniffles a bit and has a couple tears, then I\u2019m ok. However, if someone breaks down sobbing, it can cause panic attacks/flashbacks. Sally is fully aware of this, but she never really seemed to take it seriously. She\u2019s not a very emotional person, so this fact has never caused an issue until now.\n\nA few days ago, Sally came over to my house unannounced. She frantically told me that her beloved dog of 13 years passed away. She then started heavily crying and latched onto me for support. I completely froze, pushed her off of me and told her that I can\u2019t be around her right now. I went into the bathroom and sat on the floor in order to calm down. Sally continued to cry/scream at me through the door and called me a scumbag! She then left and is currently giving me the silent treatment. I feel like a horrible partner because I wasn\u2019t there when my GF needed me, but I don\u2019t mean to be inconsiderate. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If u have a problem that makes u unable to interact normally to this extent u gotta get it fixed or never expect to keep a partner. Ur can\u2019t console people when they are crying. That\u2019s kinda like a big part of being a partner.", "You need to get into serious therapy that gives you self soothing techniques, coping skills and gentle exposure experiences.

But your trauma can NOT lead your life.", "People go through emotions, that\u2019s human. If you have trauma over tears you should not be in a relationship where your SO will need your emotional support from time to time. Your relationships should be more limited or superficial until therapy works well enough for you that you can handle or want to handle being emotionally supportive to a partner when they have a need. YTA for not recognizing this and for thinking just bc you told her of your trauma meant that she should shelter you from needing you. This is how emotional affairs might pop up in your future as you close your partner\u2019s off to relying on you as a partner. Please take care of yourself first before your next relationship, good luck with that.", "YTA. When you're in a romantic relationship with someone, you should be able to support them during the worst times of their life and vice versa. You are not capable of that. You should have been clear to her and all your future partners about this. It's ridiculous to say that because she isn't a typically emotional person that you didn't think this would be an issue. \n\nEveryone suffers. Everyone will need that emotional support. I don't know how you can be in a healthy relationship if you check out like this. It just isn't fair for the other person that you can only handle the good times. \n\nI don't think you were as honest to her about your triggers as you should have been. Were you vague and said you couldn't handle it, or did you paint a clear picture for her that you will literally abandon her in dire moments, thus making things worse? That she will have to go to funerals and hospitals alone? That she can not even come home to you for comfort? That if she had cancer, you won't be there? \n\nIt's clear you know that this is your problem to overcome, but I don't think it's clear to you that you are unfairly forcing your romantic partners to handle hardships in life without you. That is traumatizing in and of itself. \n\nThere's a reason why \"hurt people hurt people\" is a saying. You're hurting her.", "~~NTA~~. First let me say I\u2019m really sorry that you went through such a traumatic thing when you were younger.\n\nSecond off, people do expect to be comforted when they\u2019re going through something traumatic themselves. Not being able to handle it is going to give her the impression that you have no empathy, and can actually come across as cruel.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you need to disclose your trauma on the first date but after two years, you should be able to talk to your girlfriend about your situation so she understands what could happen in a situation where she really needs comforting.

Obviously not your fault for having a traumatic response but how can you in your right mind, even for a SECOND think you are capable of providing for a partner emotionally? You just went into this hoping she would never display any serious emotions or trauma herself? You\u2019re an adult and you need to take some time to yourself to sort your issues out because you are NOT in a space where you can be a good partner, despite you wanting to be. If this is causing such serious issues at this late in life, you need serious, INTENSIVE CARE.

Or plans you and Sarah have made for when she is emotional and need support so you could be there for her without getting too triggered. If you've been in therapy for years, and you've been together for two years, it would consern me if you havent gotten any coping mechanisms or tools from your therapist, and that you havent been proactive in planning with Sarah for how to deal with this when it would happen.

Would be embarrassed if I was your wife.", "yea and the fact that she hasn\u2019t done it around him for  the 2 years they\u2019ve been together is insane. home girl only cracked when her dog died. i think she\u2019s as good as OP\u2019s gonna get for his type of trigger.", "Therapy specifically to address your inability to be around any crying person? Or just therapy generally addressing your traumatic past? \n\nVery different. \n\nSorry buddy, YTA. When I didn\u2019t have the skills to healthily be in a relationship and provide support for another person, I stopped dating for 6 years and consistently went to weekly therapy to work on myself. \n\nYou can\u2019t be in a healthy, supportive, fulfilling relationship if your partner crying requires you to physically remove yourself from the situation. You\u2019re never going to be in any relationship in which this doesn\u2019t become a problem.", "I would highly recommend cognitive behavioural therapy. When it comes to things like this talking therapies aren\u2019t going to work, you need to learn how to deal with it physically. CBT will help you with that!", "Have you tried a therapist that\u2019s really good at helping with cognitive behavioral therapy?", "If you don't figure out how to get past this trauma and be emotionally avaliable for your partner, you'll lose this gf and any others you get\n\nYou need to get this sorted.

Don't worry they're almost always the asshole no matter what so go ahead and call him whatever you want", "FAIR WARNING: emdr does some *weird* magic shit in the brain. I tried it with my therapist and nothing at all happened during the session, so we concluded that I'd probably have to work on being able to actually access my traumatic memories in order to work on them (or something in a similar vein.)\n\nAlmost exactly a week later, I read a particularly psychological soulmates AU fanfic and was speedrun through multiple years of therapy against my will at 4am on a Tuesday. So, EMDR works (incredibly well, actually- I was and am very impressed) but *watch out* because it is capable of sneak attacks.", "My grandmother died 5 years ago. I'm tearing up typing this and I broke down sobbing over the weekend when I had a dream she was still alive and woke up and she wasn't. I can and do regulate that emotion myself, but being alone is so much better than being lonely in a room with someone else (or a room someone else just fled).", "It makes me wonder if it was really therapy. OP talks about it like it was something he did on/off over the years, so it could be that he was just showing up rather than working on things, but idk. A lot of people use \u201ccounseling\u201d and \u201ctherapy\u201d interchangeably so I\u2019m wondering if OP may have only seen a counselor occasionally. \n\nIf you have issues like OP\u2019s, seeing a counselor is like putting a bandaid over a gunshot wound. He needs assessed for PTSD & CPTSD and to see a therapist who specializes in such things.", "I don't have this problem and I'm not a therapist, but I have found therapy very useful for my childhood trauma. I suspect that the place to start would be some kind if grounding exercise to help the person being triggered mentally stay in the here-and-now. It sounds like OP wasn't really reacting to their gf anymore but the traumatic situation that they experienced in their childhood. A mantra could potentially do that. Some people focus on details of the physical room around them, that sort of thing.\n\nI can sometimes recognise that my body is going into fight-or-flight mode and it's not actually a rational or proportionate reaction to the situation I'm in. Usually I can just focus on my breathing and that's enough to get me through the situation. Then as soon as I'm able, I do some self care and kinda baby myself through the adrenaline hangover feeling.", "Sometimes you have to consider the general consensus and understand that a major outlier like this case in this situation is going to be questioned.\n\u201c my gf can\u2019t cry around me ever because of something that happened\u201d Is very unusual to hear. Most people aren\u2019t triggered by crying. It\u2019s not an unreasonable thing to question, at the very least considering the rarity of the condition.", "Currently I am working on this specific subject more to improve my marriage and also friendships, because obviously it is not cool to be completely overwhelmed when somebody has problems.\n\nThe problems with my kid are discussed as they happen. Tbh there aren't many though. My behaviour is completely different with my kid and it is waaay easier for me to deal with his emotions as i know I am 100% responsible for his well-being. So even though I am a mess when my husband is depressed I am still the caring mother that wipes away tears and hugs him and talks his feelings through. But my therapist already warned me it won't stay that easy.", "My nephew (5) screams and cries everytime his little sister (2) contributes during story telling time (only when it\u2019s with me, I only see them about once a month or so most of the year and he\u2019s really attached to me.

As a fellow PTSD\u2019er, I agree. I\u2019ve had to work intensively to identify and process my triggers. Whilst it\u2019s good to let people know that\u2019s what you\u2019re working on and the triggers might be a sensitive subject, ultimately it is my responsibility to manage these and can\u2019t use them as an excuse to alter the reasonable behaviour of others.", "I\u2019m a big leaker, but it\u2019s also from childhood abuse. I got hit and scolded more because \u201cit\u2019s a sign of weakness and silent protest\u201d but it just made me cry even more uncontrollably. Now I cry pretty much anytime where I get emotional, I think that switch in my brain is just broken beyond repair. I always have to explain and apologize to people that they are not the reason why I cry and hopefully my tears are not troubling them. \n\nI think traumas make some people more emphatic towards others people and their pain, but it isn\u2019t the case for OP. Your trauma shouldnt enable you to deprive others of their freedom to express emotionally, especially when they have a good reason to. OP should see a therapist and apologize to girlfriend.", "Is this a hypothetical question? \n.....", "Wait... How do you build surround sound into a sex doll?  Like, don't you need additional speakers all around you?", "\"What did we learn here today?\"", "Oh I\u2019m sorry I replied to the wrong comment!", "I third EMDR! It helped me hit the root causes of my trauma, and reprocess them so I can recall them with a much reduced emotional response, and also did more for me than medications, which felt more as a mood stabiliser than anything else.", "that's really interesting... i've been considering emdr and am honestly kind of afraid of it. i'm afraid it'll work really well and i'll be reliving the awful memories so vividly, or that it'll do nothing and i'll feel truly stuck. it's kiiiind of comforting to hear that it didn't necessarily hit you in the session itself but still seems to have helped you... thanks for sharing.", "The dreams I had after the seemingly useless sessions were wild.", "I scared my therapist when we did it. I shut down severely and he struggled to pull me back. I don\u2019t want to discourage folks from trying it because I\u2019ve seen it do wonders. But I also think people should know it can cause a spiral downwards or make things worse.", "Yeah, he should have just stayed there, had a panic attack and relived his trauma like a good boyfriend.\n\nI totally agree with the people who have empathy for the GF, address that this causes an unhealthy relationship dynamic, and that he should be continuing therapy if he's able.\n\nBut acting like he just made a choice to abandon his GF as if he could just hold it in is so invalidating of trauma. I don't even have trauma, but I've went through periods of frequent panic attacks, and I had no way out of them aside from waiting for them to pass.\n\nTherapy also isn't this magic solution where you put coins in and come out perfectly healthy and \"normal\". On top of that, it's really fucking expensive and not everyone can afford to be in regular therapy for their entire life. OP has struggles from traumatic experiences, and his GF has to decide if they are things that she can deal with. You can empathize with both people in this situation", "My mom saw real therapists intermittently for years but she wasn't willing to do the work or be vulnerable so she never made any progress. Some people think of therapy as something that's done to you, but it's a lot of work to do it right.", "Exactly my thoughts.", "He has the tools, just not the will to use them. That\u2019s what this is. \u201cI\u2019ve been in and out of therapy\u201d means you are repeatedly, willingly, stubbornly, not learning how to use the tools the therapists give you.

Never been circumcised.", "I work with a physio who specializes in working with amputees.

It's about taking what you have and making it work.", "It's a shame you're being downvoted, because you are absolutely correct!\n\nEMDR did not work for me. I'm now trying a different therapy called Rapid Resolution Therapy (RRT) and it's working much better for me.\n\nNot that EMDR doesn't work for many people, but it's not always the right fit... Just like certain medications can work well for some but not for others, certain therapies can work well for some but not for others.\n\nThe people on here, I swear lol", "So basically it's worthless except on this worthless site for a worthless silly reason.", "I actually didn't relive anything. I didn't get flashbacks of any sort at any point. I just saw pieces of myself in the characters and the ways they were dealing with them and so it brought me to some really big conclusions. There was crying involved, because the realizations were connected to some core beliefs about myself, but it was really more startling than devastating in the way flashbacks are for me.\n\nPersonally, I will be doing it again at some point, because I think that the understanding I got really would have taken me at least 2 years of normal therapy to get. A good practitioner will also make sure you have good coping mechanisms and understand any potential risks before starting. Best of luck and healing to you <3", "Yeah, that\u2019s why I said it was also possible OP was just showing up. I just wondered if he even went at all because this is a pretty extreme reaction to someone seeking comfort.", "Exactly! You can go to therapy, to wonderful therapists and make zero progress if you aren't putting in any effort. \n\nI have a coworker with PTSD and horrible codependency. She sees the same exact therapist that I see for my PTSD. She's been in therapy for two years, has made zero improvement and keeps repeating the same patterns. She honestly seems to go just to say she is in therapy but refuses to actually be vulnerable.", "Touche!", "Think of it more like consent.  Sometimes people don't want to be touched against their will.", "Have you considered the possibility of these kids being neurodivergent?", "I\u2019ve been working on getting my 6 year old to not melt down over minor things since he was 1.

Who else\u2019s responsibility would it possibly be??", "The issue people are taking is their stance that EMDR is broadly not recommended in complex trauma, which is entirely untrue. \n\nNot all therapies are right for all people. That\u2019s true. But their comment is off the rails with misinformation and misunderstanding of how trauma therapy impacts someone as they go through it.", "Yah lol but I guess that depends if being allowed to participate in discussions on here is worthless", "I think COVID has a lot to do with the kids who can't self regulate. These (first graders) were 3/4 when it started and they spent a lot of time at home not going out in the world and learning what it's like to be a part of it.", "Yes. Without going into specific details about the children, neurodivergence is not the issue, or at least not the main issue. First, they are capable of self regulating, because they do it some days. Second, there are many neurodivergent children in my classroom, the majority of whom are capable of self regulating emotions in an age appropriate way. Third, I am neurodivergent myself. I know every neurodivergent individual is different, but I also know neurodivergence in an of itself does not render one incapable of self regulation. It just means one uses different tools to manage the sensory overload inputs. I incorporate those tools into my classroom practice. \n\nThe students who are not able to self regulate emotions in an age appropriate way are, for lack of a better term, neurodivergent+.\n\nThe + is for whatever extra challenge is creating extra disregulation in those 18 hours outside of school. Typical culprits are:\n\n1. Custody disputes/ parenting disagreements between split households. \n\n2. Emotionally overattached/ permissive snowplow parents who let their kids do/ have whatever they want. \n\n3. Lack of sleep (children this age should be getting 10-12 hours sleep).\n\nNormally, the students I get in my class who are this unsocialized to routines, other children, and school are hiders and runners. This is the first time I've gotten screamers, and it turns out it's a domino effect. One screamer starts and it sets off the others. \n\nNot only do feel terrible for the disregulated children, but I feel terrible for all my other students, who just want to do story or snack, and are trying very hard to both avoid and not set off the screamer who has a tendency to invade their personal bubble, then get angry when they move away. \n\nIt's an upsetting and exhausting situation for all involved. I am trying to teach my students both to be a community, and also that they are not responsible for managing someone else's emotions, because they are literally walking on eggshells around these kids. The other day, one of my screamers took a deep breath preliminary to screaming, and the rest of kids began to say, \"You're okay, it's okay,  you're okay, it's okay, \" until it turned into a classroom chant trying to prevent the kiddo from screaming. It broke my heart. They shouldn't be taking that weight on themselves!", "Piss. Missed opportunity.", "I don't think you read it clearly. \n\nIt's not his responsibility to fix himself for HER. If he wants to fix himself, it should be because he wants to better himself.", "No, they said EMDR is \"not *always* recommended\" not that it is *broadly not*  recommended.\n\nTwo very different things. \n\nPeople need to brush up on their reading comprehension before going on the attack\n\nEdit a word", "That absolutely makes sense - 3/4 is such a critical time for developing empathy and basic social skills and, as you said, self-regulation. Great point, thank you.", "I was the \"good kid\" who was like the designated class emotional support human or something (and that's probably not all on my teachers, my family was pretty dysfunctional and I'm sure I acted out the comfortable role of my own volition at times). I remember being torn about certain classmates who were really unpleasant for various reasons but I knew it wasn't their fault they were that way. I could never do your job but thank you for doing it so thoughtfully.", "Wow, what a thoughtful and well written response . I think it's great. It's acknowledgeing the kids' problems but at the same time describing the reality of the people around them.\n\nMy daughter was best friends with an autistic boy and while I tried to educate myself about his problems and realised how hard it was for the parents I noticed that they did not really try to teach him boundaries. Once he had a meltdown in my presence and I stopped it right away. Then I realised that he could actually self-regulate if he had to. \n\nActually the friendship broke because he expected things to always be his way. When my daughter wanted her way some times he would just leave, deeply offended, and not communicate for days and weeks. Unfortunately this destroyed all friendships he ever had. It's not easy, for nobody."]}
