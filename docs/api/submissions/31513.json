I put up with the crap because I wanted my son to love the holidays with both sets of grandparents. \n\nSpoiler alert - he doesn't. In fact, he has no use for Christmas, at 24 years old because my stress and misery over having to deal with those people rubbed off on him, and he now views Christmas as a gift grab that costs more money than it's worth and forces you to tolerate people you dislike. This was not the viewpoint I ever wanted him to have, but I thought if I sucked it up, it would be okay. It's not.\n\nI've cut contact with that bunch, and suddenly, it's like the Christmas pinata broke and showered me with glitter and holiday cheer ... and it feels **so** **good**. I'm hoping it will make him and the husband feel good, too.\n\nTL;dr - Don't think you're helping your kid by making yourself miserable. Tell MIL to screw off with her comments and make YOUR holiday with the people you love.", "How old is he? When I was younger and still dragged to family thanksgiving I hated it, my grandma has never been a good cook and my mom's phenomenal, you can guess why I hated it. \n\nNow, we're actually on vacation this year, but most years after I turned 12 were spent at home, my uncle comes over sometimes but not always. \n\nIt's nice to enter a food coma in the comfort of your own home.", "u/TimeFoChange www.outofthefog.net - to help you grow your spine", "It's been 20 years, why hasn't he stood up to her without your prompting?", "No, send him with the groceries the MIL drops off.", "I wholeheartedly agree. This is the first year in about 20 (I'm 26) that the holidays have a chance of not being so miserable I spend them crying or trying to end things, and I'm spending them completely alone. It's quite an impressive feat for this year to be the best when I've been in an out of emergency care since Friday, but that's how miserable my family is. \n\nIf I'm well enough and can afford it next year I'll be going across the country to spend the holidays with a friend and her baby, but I refuse to even think about answering my mom's messages or calls until next year.", "Don\u2019t drag the son into a feud between mom and grandma. Not cool.", "That is what I meant.", "They're not. They're telling the kid why they have a problem with grandma and showing how to enforce a boundary or self respect.", "Only if it's dented and the label is worn and a bit torn."]}
