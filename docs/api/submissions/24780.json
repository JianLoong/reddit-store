She and my dad (M53) got married two years ago, and she disliked as soon as we met because I had my girlfriend over. As soon as I introduced myself and my gf, sm turned to my dad and whispered, (not very quietly) \"You didn't mention *this* about your daughter.\" She was never directly homophobic to me, but I heard her and my dad argue some about it until she eventually dropped the subject, I assume because she didn't want it to ruin their relationship. \n\nI graduated in 2022 and have been at uni in another state. While I was there I met my current gf (F20). We've been together for 9 months, and I'm truly in love with her. She comes from a deaf family and is deaf herself, so I started learning ASL. I am now conversant, I can easily understand signing and be understood.\n\nLast week gf came to stay with me and meet my family. She had met dad over the phone and he loved her already, but I was worried about sm bc of her past bigoted tendencies. As soon as they were introduced sm ignored my request that she speak slower so gf can read her lips, and acted like she wasn't there even though she knws gf is deaf. I tried to interpret, but I could tell gf was uncomfy. It was just the two of us for most of her visit, but we had a family dinner planned which is when things went to shit.\n\nWe decided I would be her interpreter, (gf was uncomfy with her deaf accent) I let fam know in advance, and it was fine until we all sat down to eat. I signed when anyone was speaking, and I voiced anything gf signed. Then, when sm was saying something she abruptly stopped mid-sentence, looked at me, and snapped \"Stop flailing your hands around while I'm talking! It's incredibly distracting!\" I stayed calm as I responded \"I'm signing so gf can understand you, you know that.\" She didn't argue but kept glaring at me after. \n\nLater dad was making dessert, and sm said \"Your relationship doesn't seem healthy, you learned a whole language for her and she can't even bother to speak.\" I didn't answer and told her to stop being rude. We were eating dessert when dad asked gf something, and while she was signing sm interrupted, \"Would you use your words? You're not a child and you should know how to speak for yourself.\" I didn't sign it but gf read her lips and left the table crying. I blew up at sm and yelled, \"God, if I knew you were gonna be such an ableist bitch to the woman I love, I never would have brought her here. I can't believe my dad ever married you, you're a sorry excuse for a woman! I hope he divorces you!\" \n\nShe was crying and started to yell back but my dad calmed her down before glaring at me and saying \"I can't believe you just spoke to her that way, apologize now!\" I just scoffed and left the table in anger before going to my room to find gf. I've been getting the cold should from sm since then, and while my dad agrees that her actions weren't acceptable he thinks it was a \"complete asshole move\" to say what I did.\n\nAITA?

Not for being with your GF (I know lots of people believe that bullshit that anyone who falls in love with a disabled person is some sort of angel doing us a favour), who also sounds amazing . . . but because you seem to inherently understand that relationships with ANYONE are a two-way street, and you put effort into meeting her where she is (i.e. learning her language, understanding that while she CAN talk it might make her self-conscious), instead of expecting her to adapt to you. You sound like a wonderful partner. And that very much extends to calling out people like your stepmother who have the opposite expectation, that a Deaf or disabled person should make all the effort to make HER comfortable, instead of it being reciprocal.\n\nI'm usually a very loving, respectful person, but your SM was flat-out hateful and rude to a guest in her home.

So your dad isn't acknowledging how incredibly rude she was to your gf but you need to apologize for finally blowing up at her? Um, no. I would calmly point out the rude statements she made and say I'll apologize for calling her a B *after* she apologizes to my gf for her ableist, rude comments.", "NTA.

It's like she's a completely different person when she's with him, and she's only ever had moments like this a few times.", "Most of the time she's not actually rude to my face, she's pretty good at putting on a fake face and hiding her feelings. If things ever escalated the way they had tonight I would've totally put her in her place the way I did, this is the first time I felt the need to.", "He actually has apologized to me for not speaking up, sm has never been this outwardly rude before, and any time she's even hinted at something homophobic towards me he immediately shut her down. He told me he just kind of felt at a loss about what to do because he didn't want to overstep his bounds when he doesn't know much about the deaf community. He still believes I could've handled the situation more calmly, but he understands that I'm upset with him, and very upset with sm, and he's giving me and gf space.", "Thank you! I appreciate the comment, and I'm glad to know from someone in the disabled community that I'm doing a good job, even though my girlfriend lets me know pretty often. I showed this to her, and she said she very much appreciates your support!", "because she's awful?", "Mainly because I'm gay. Like I said, the first time I met her my high school girlfriend was over, and she immediately disapproved. My dad never told her, because why would he, and, although she's never said anything directly homophobic to my face (probably because my dad has told her not to) I'm still very aware of her feelings about it. Most of the time she kind of just keeps me an arms length, and treats me civilly.", "It was actually a pretty big surprise to me that my dad didn't say anything, sm has never been rude to this extent but anytime in the past when she's even come close to being homophobic, my dad has immediately shut her down. The next morning, he did apologize for not speaking up and said he was afraid to say the wrong thing because he doesn't know a lot about the deaf community, but he does still think I should've handled the situation more calmly. Either way, I'm still upset with him and he understands that so he's been giving me and gf space. No, my birth mom is not in the picture.", "I don't live at home, I'm just visiting for the summer. I share an apartment with my girlfriend near our university and we split the rent. My dad does pay for a lot, but he already told me that he completely understands if gf and I want to leave, and apologized for his behavior.", "No matter how great you think he is he's enabling and supporting her bigotted behavior which effectively makes him a bigot as well. \n\nI would advise going low contact and explaining to him exactly why. That until he stops being a bigot by enabling a bigot you don't want to talk to him more than you absolutely must", "Like they say, \u201cWatch the way someone treats people that can\u2019t do anything for them.\u201d", "op, I'm sorry, but he's not a 'great man'. he married her knowing what she was like the moment she first met you. I would never have continued a relationship with someone who said to me what she said him in that first meeting, much less married them. and to defend her even now? there's a limit to how much you can ignore before flat out being a bigot by association yourself,  and your father is definitely reaching that point", "I'm sorry, but your dad is not a great man. He willingly married a homophobic woman knowing his daughter is gay. There's literally no excuse he could ever offer that would make it OK.", "be fr, he is not that great", "I don't think your father wears rose colored glasses; that's purely self-centered behavior. He doesn't truly care about his wife's thoughts or your feelings. As long as everyone around him maintains a superficial harmony for him to comfortably revel in, he doesn't concern himself with the struggles within your hearts.", "She's a \"completely different person\" with him because he's a straight man who is currently able-bodied. She probably has \"had moments\" like this way more often than he consciously realizes because he's not the target of her bigotry. \n\n(I say \"currently able-bodied\" because everyone is only one bad day away from being disabled. Is she going to be a good partner to him if he gets hit by a bus and needs a wheelchair? If he develops an age-related illness a couple decades down the line?)", "From what you've said about her reaction to your sexuality and to your girlfriend being deaf -- things that she did/said in front of or to your father, it doesn't sound like she's a completely different person when he's around. He's just been willing to ignore her behavior until you or someone else blows up because he *can*.", "That's good! Your example probably gave him courage and direction as well. Abuse and disrespect should never be accepted, although perhaps next time you can calmly ask her if she's being (discriminatory/ Phobic/ ableist/ mean/ whatever)", "Understood. It seemed like from the wording that you moved home after graduation. You seem to have a good head on your shoulders.", "I didn't speak with him right after the incident because I wanted to be with gf and make sure she was okay before anything else. We did talk the next morning, and he immediately apologized for not speaking up and said he felt he was overstepping his bounds since he doesn't know much about the deaf community. He understands that I am upset with him and extremely upset with sm so he's giving me and gf space, and no longer requiring me to apologize to sm even though he still thinks that I could've handled the situation more calmly. This is the only time I've ever experienced him being complacent, anytime in the past that sm even hinted at something homophobic, he would immediately shut her down.", "Yeah, and although I have to admit that I don't really regret what I said because of my strong dislike for my sm, it was really more of a spur-of-the-moment thing. I've been dealing with her fake niceness for years, but when I saw her going after my girlfriend, my protective instincts just kicked in.", "Sorry about that, the details were more clear, but I ran out of words, so I had to shorten things. I graduated from high school in 2022, and now I am in university. I was just visiting home for the summer. And thank you!", "And yet he stayed married to her. She was repeatedly homophobic enough to warrant getting \"shut down\" and he still stayed with her. His wife repeatedly made bigoted remarks (doesn't matter how veiled) about his child/his child's identity, and **he stayed with her**.   \nThat is not a man I could trust or rely on, because he is able to stay married to someone who is clearly a bigot and doesn't think his child deserves human rights. Actions speak louder than words, and his actions have enabled a homophobe.", "You need to cut you dad off until he has your back. He doesn't have your back, if he actually cared about her homophobia, he would have dropped her the moment it happened. He didn't. He still accepts her in his life despite her hatred for you. Thats not a good father.", "That much is good but is that good enough? If he acts complacent once he'll do it again. And personally myself if I had a bigoted partner it wouldn't be enough to just shut them down, I'd dump them the moment I figured out they're a bigot", "Perfectly said."]}
