I am now conversant, I can easily understand signing and be understood.\n\nLast week gf came to stay with me and meet my family. She had met dad over the phone and he loved her already, but I was worried about sm bc of her past bigoted tendencies. As soon as they were introduced sm ignored my request that she speak slower so gf can read her lips, and acted like she wasn't there even though she knws gf is deaf.

It was just the two of us for most of her visit, but we had a family dinner planned which is when things went to shit.\n\nWe decided I would be her interpreter, (gf was uncomfy with her deaf accent) I let fam know in advance, and it was fine until we all sat down to eat. I signed when anyone was speaking, and I voiced anything gf signed.

It's incredibly distracting!\" I stayed calm as I responded \"I'm signing so gf can understand you, you know that.\" She didn't argue but kept glaring at me after. \n\nLater dad was making dessert, and sm said \"Your relationship doesn't seem healthy, you learned a whole language for her and she can't even bother to speak.\" I didn't answer and told her to stop being rude. We were eating dessert when dad asked gf something, and while she was signing sm interrupted, \"Would you use your words? You're not a child and you should know how to speak for yourself.\" I didn't sign it but gf read her lips and left the table crying. I blew up at sm and yelled, \"God, if I knew you were gonna be such an ableist bitch to the woman I love, I never would have brought her here. I can't believe my dad ever married you, you're a sorry excuse for a woman! I hope he divorces you!\" \n\nShe was crying and started to yell back but my dad calmed her down before glaring at me and saying \"I can't believe you just spoke to her that way, apologize now!\" I just scoffed and left the table in anger before going to my room to find gf.

His wife repeatedly made bigoted remarks (doesn't matter how veiled) about his child/his child's identity, and **he stayed with her**.   \nThat is not a man I could trust or rely on, because he is able to stay married to someone who is clearly a bigot and doesn't think his child deserves human rights.

To say otherwise is to take the side of the offender.  Basically, your dad is saying that your SM gets to say whatever she wants, no matter how offensive, and if you raise your voice in response, she is the victim.  Your dad needs to understand that if he doesn't want to shut down your SM with kindness and grace, others will with harsh words or worse.  \n\nYou need to have a talk with your dad about how neither of them get to dictate how other people react when your SM says offensive things.

You were totally justified in exploding on your father's wife, but I personally prefer being a laser beam instead of a firework when staring someone down or telling them off. In my experience, it's incredible effective against people ranging from mean drunks to all-out predators (had a few in my family).\n\nSometimes being a \"gray rock\" helps, since you're not giving father's wife what she wants \u2014 to know she hurt you and to get a chance to weaponize your own response against you. It actually gives you some form of empowerment, and totally counts as a victory. \n\nBut when it comes to protecting your loved ones, gray rocking probably isn't the way to go. Be fierce with them. Be a laser beam.", "Yeah, at minimum, OP\u2019s dad has decided that homophobia and ableism aren\u2019t dealbreakers for him.
