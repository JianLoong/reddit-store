You are understandably excited for the birth of your **first grandchild**. Like you pointed out, your younger son and his girlfriend haven't managed to stay together more than six months, and she's putting in like they've been together six years. Were you around for the birth of her child? It doesn't sound like it. Do you owe her child anything? Absolutely not. I do feel for the 10-year-old boy in this mess, his mom is an entitled prick who popped out a baby as a teenager and now expects everyone else to take care of him. I guarantee you're not the first one she's had the grandparent tantrum at, and if this relationship goes like it sounds the others have, you won't be the last. By the way, where is the 10-year-old's **biological** father? Probably a good question to ask.\n\nThrow that all-out baby shower for your daughter-in-law (because you have basically adopted her, at this point). Make sure Kelly isn't invited, though, because she'll try and cause all kinds of drama if she's given the chance.", "NTA You are right that Jason and Kelly aren\u2019t married and the child she had when she was 16 is not your grandchild. It\u2019s a shame that he has to witness his mother still acting like a child and throwing tantrums, but you can\u2019t help that. If they get married, a big if of course, her son will be your grandchild then but he isn\u2019t yet, and all of Kelly\u2019s theatrics won\u2019t change that. But let the boy know it isn\u2019t his fault and you care for him and want him in your life. Don\u2019t promise to be his grandmother because if they break up, his loss will be worse. Give him Christmas presents even if they don\u2019t show up for dinner, but you don\u2019t have to apologize to Jason and Kelly.", "Going against the grain here and saying NTA. I mean what about it was false? Did he adopt the kid? No, looks like she had multiple men in out and of his life. How on earth she could think that you would think he\u2019s your grandchild is laughable. Don\u2019t get everyone saying y t a", "NTA in a sense that you were right he's not your grandson since they're not even married. IDK the issues of your son's GF ex if he has parents which is actually the kids grandparents. Why is she insisting to make you the grandma? You could've chosen a better way to tell her gently but it seems you dont like her. So NTA out of technicality but soft YTA for delivery. lol", "NTA, you\u2019re entitled to be happy about your first biological grandchild. That girl has not married your son and you\u2019ll have no link to her child when they inevitably break up. Likely to happen, unless she traps him.

She isn\u2019t entitled to an explanation, your excitement has nothing to do with her child. Selfish and manipulative to make it about her. Don\u2019t bother trying to reach this girl, talk with your son privately. Make him be the middleman and sort her out. She\u2019s more than welcome at events, if she can act like family.\n\nWell handled. Firm, but still polite. If you let her get away with this episode, then she\u2019s got the whole family by the balls.

This woman's child is not your grandchild.", "NTA. She was trying to steal the spotlight and caught the glare instead.", "NTA, OP, I agree with everything you said. \"Kelly\" sounds very tiresome.", "NTA.

I don't even get that.", "NTA,\n\nFor a mother not to have full custody or even 50/50 split usually mean she must have done something really bad for the court to go that way. Or that she gave up her rights.\n\nYou had mentioned that she likes drama and to be the center of attention so something must have already happened with the two of you.\n\nYou also mentioned that when they get married the son will be your grandchild. \n\nBased on what was said, I would say NTA.", "NTA, you do not have that type of relationship with your son's GF and much less with her son. You might have been harsh with her but based on what you said about her and your feelings for her I can see why you snapped at her.", "NTA. You barely know the kid", "Nta.

I largely think you\u2019re NTA here, unless this was said in front of the kid.

This makes you the asshole.", "Look, I'm guessing you didn't say anything you didn't mean. And you didn't say anything that wasn't reasonable. I don't doubt that you would welcome her son like a grandson if your son and Kelly decided to get serious / married.\n\nIt just raises the question of whether you needed to be so confrontational w/ Kelly on this occasion. I am guessing no. I almost always vote. But I have to say, OP, I think I want to put the ball in your court. Do you think you're the asshole?\n\nYou own that you're not supportive of Kelly's relationship with your son. She seems like a bit of a brat. But maybe that's just covering up her neediness. She is, in her dysfunctional way, asking for you to accept and love her and her kid. What if you decided to support her, as an individual? If you remained agnostic on whether she was a good partner for your son, but decided to be as kind as you could to her? (As you are to Tory, and, I assume, to your sons...) What would that feel like to her? To you?", "NTA. Just spittin facts. Seemed weird you told the whole story not mentioning Kelly had a kid until the end though. If Jason was married to her it would be different. You should know tact matters, this isnt your first rodeo", "NTA. But I agree you could have been less abrupt about it. Technically, you are right. Kelly\u2019s child has no legal relationship to you, and only a tenuous moral one (since Kelly and your son are just on/off BF and GF). But it\u2019s possible that they may settle down some day\u2014or he may knock her up, thus giving you a blood grandson and his half-brother, and then you\u2019d have to treat them equally. \n\nI\u2019d be happy about having my first grandchild by blood, too. But I would have tried not to make a big deal about it in front of Kelly, just to show some class.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to handle Tory\u2019s baby shower. You can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t throw it. That honor goes to Tory\u2019s best friend. If you\u2019re lucky, maybe she\u2019ll have her shower out of state so maybe Kelly can be conveniently left out of it. If it\u2019s held where you all live now, it\u2019s going to be messy to not invite Kelly, and possibly messier to invite her. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to make that call. It\u2019s lose-lose. \n\nGood luck to all of you. And congrats on your incubating grandchild!", "ESH.

Sometimes the thoughts in your head shouldn't make it to your mouth.", "YTA. You're taking your frustrations out on her when your son is just as much to blame for their relationship problems.

Imagine how hurt that child is. Shame on both of you, but especially you.", "ESH, except the kids. All of y'all seem very toxic.", "YTA\n\nYou clearly don't like this girl and are downplaying her relationship with your son (which you admit has been going on for years). \n\nYou intentionally tried to hurt her feelings.\n\nEdit: Honestly, re-reading your post made it more clear that both of these relationships are about the same and are on-and-off. You just clearly favor one of them over the other.", "While I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for not considering Kelly\u2019s son your grandson, YTA for spending a holiday showering Tory with attention and plans for a baby shower etc while your other son and his gf are there. You admit to not liking Kelly. You don\u2019t speak highly of Jason either. You\u2019re not doing yourself any favors by being openly hostile towards one son and his gf while going overboard with affection for the other.", "YTA but I get where you're coming from. \n\nI know it's not what you probably want to hear but your son has this woman in his life for better or worse. You may not want to treat her son as part of the family since they have a very rocky relationship but what happens if this time they stay together and make it work? Now her son (your grandson) has to know that he's not very welcome in the family and that can be really damaging for one as young as he is. He is a part of your life now regardless of how you feel about the relationship and shouldn't be punished by you for the choices of his mother and your son. I feel bad for him honestly because it sounds as though he's already dealing with a lot as it is via their relationship troubles.\n\nI think you should consider apologizing at least for saying it how you did and maybe try to explain to your son & her how their relationship has affected you and resulted in the reaction you had. Healthy communication can fix a lot and you definitely don't want to strain the relationship between you and your son.", "ESH. \n\nWhile I understand where you're coming from, you definitely do not come out of this smelling of roses. Some of your comments seem very unnecessary and spiteful. And frankly, I feel sorry for the young lad.", "YTA. you just couldn\u2019t keep your mouth shut and let this one slide, could you ?", "Look, that child might not be your literal first grandchild, but you really showed how *nasty* you really are here. \n\nI probably wouldn't expect too many visits in the nursing home once that time comes, Brenda.", "I\u2019m honestly stuck in between. YTA in the way that you spoke to her. Her and your son may not be married or even stable, but I don\u2019t think you should have been that rude about it. \n\nNTA because I understand not considering the child your grandchild as they have a rough relationship and maybe getting close to the child like that would hurt every time they split or eventually permanently split, but come on. \n\nEither way Your son has chosen her (for now) and you should still have some decency in the way you treat and speak to her.", "You're not the asshole for not considering her son to be your grandson. But you're absolutely a huge asshole. YTA.", "You\u2019re only going to push Jason away by mistreating Kelly.  Every time you\u2019re rude to her, it drives them closer together, because it engages his protective instincts.  I get that you don\u2019t like her.  But being hurtful is not going to get him to agree with you.  It only makes you look bad to your son.  Do you want to lose your son over this?\n\n\nRespect his choices, and support his decisions.  He gets to choose his mate, not you.  Figure out how to get along, and stop judging their relationship.  You\u2019re not judging Grant and Tory for being on/off again.  So stop judging Kelly.  You don\u2019t have to like her.

Was trying to leave that put, but... whatever.", "People openly discuss children all the time in most cases scenarios is gets competitive and or mean and what op said was factual, why would she consider a kid she\u2019s met 5 times max that is constantly being ripped away her first grandkid? They haven\u2019t dated for more than 6 months at a time and are constantly breaking up making her \u201close\u201d her first grandkid. She hasn\u2019t done anything wrong to him and as long as she treats him well, what that kid is to her doesn\u2019t really matter, she didn\u2019t grow up forming bonds with this kid, she doesn\u2019t get \u201cgrandma time\u201d and if I was a kid and some random lady I barely know started saying I\u2019m her grandchild I\u2019d be very creeped out. The mother doesn\u2019t get time with the kids and neither does OP, she hasn\u2019t treated him as commodity because she doesn\u2019t even see the kid, yea if she wants a relationship with her son she\u2019ll have to play nice and treat all the kids the same but again, when would she even have the chance to do that.", "[deleted]", "I kind of guessed drugs . . .\n\nMy personal feeling is, if you make a decision with a full understanding of the potential consequences, but with the understanding that that may well be the lesser of two evils, and knowing that it may well be what brings you the most peace, you aren't TA. It's okay that you don't feel great about it - that's a sign you're a basically decent person. But sometimes you have to protect yourself, and that's okay too.", "To me, this was an escalation of her behavior, that I felt was important to stop"]}
