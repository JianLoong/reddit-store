When they were younger she wasn't ready for anything serious and was too busy with school or work. \n\nI know they both kind of dated other people but they always stayed close. \n\nRecently, he went to visit her and... few weeks later I found out I was going to be a grandma. \n\nI adore Tory, and her and Grant are great together.

I told her \"no, that will always be your child, and if my son decides on you, I will see him as my grand child, but they won't be my first. Tory's baby will always be my first grand child. \n\nShe threw a fit, said that my son chose a woman with kids, and they should be accepted by the family, and then said Tory basically baby trapped Grant. \n\nI told her to get back to me after they got married, or at least managed to stay together more than 6 months. \n\nShe stormed out, son stormed out.

Kelly\u2019s child has no legal relationship to you, and only a tenuous moral one (since Kelly and your son are just on/off BF and GF).

You may not want to treat her son as part of the family since they have a very rocky relationship but what happens if this time they stay together and make it work? Now her son (your grandson) has to know that he's not very welcome in the family and that can be really damaging for one as young as he is. He is a part of your life now regardless of how you feel about the relationship and shouldn't be punished by you for the choices of his mother and your son. I feel bad for him honestly because it sounds as though he's already dealing with a lot as it is via their relationship troubles.\n\nI think you should consider apologizing at least for saying it how you did and maybe try to explain to your son & her how their relationship has affected you and resulted in the reaction you had.

He gets to choose his mate, not you.  Figure out how to get along, and stop judging their relationship.  You\u2019re not judging Grant and Tory for being on/off again.  So stop judging Kelly.
