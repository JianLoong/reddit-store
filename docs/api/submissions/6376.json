Whatever this person is, they are not a good friend.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Unless you had invited her over for a meal, she should not have simply expected food from you. Also, the fact that she is still mad after you explained your situation is pretty rude of her.", "NTA. She was not invited for lunch or dinner and knowing your struggles she should've made sure to eat before coming over. \n\nI don't know her and can't judge her personality overall, but the way she made herself look is like all she wanted was a free meal. \n\nOn a more personal note, I'm not saying she had to, but if I were in her shoes, I'd order in for both. Doesn't take such a lot of effort to be nice.", "NTA, only thing you were wrong for was apologizing to her and offering to cover her next year, she deserves neither apology nor your money.", "NTA - and I would not consider her a friend. Unless you specifically invited her to dine together, she has no right to demand food. She acted with entitlement and a complete lack of grace, or friendship for what matter.\n\nIronically, she's the actual cheapskate. I'm sure she had plenty of time to stop by somewhere and get something to eat", "NTA\n\nYour friend is not entitled to a free meal from you, even if you weren't poor right now.", "NTA. She probably never had to worry about food on the table and she's lacking empathy to understand your situation. \n\nFriends help out friends, they shouldn't expect your last food to be theirs.", "These days people have the tendency to make you feel like an asshole and guilty even without your fault. You are not the asshole for this OP. Especially considering you explained your situation to her. You know your situation and you did what was needed so it's okay. Take care.", "She's an asshole friend. Friends don't treat you this way.", "NTA! Being a student is super hard and you made it clear that whatever you had left (not a lot) you couldn\u2019t spare. \n\nAlso, if you know she makes 3X more than you, she probably does as well. \n\nIt sounds like she was expecting you to cater to her, which isn\u2019t fair. She could\u2019ve offered to get McDonald\u2019s for both of you, yet she didn\u2019t. She\u2019s the AH.", "Damn... if you were my friend I'd have taken you to the store, bought some food for you, and we could both eat.", "NTA\n\nYou do not have to feed another capable young adult. Also, please do not accept this treatment from so called friends. Real friends uplift each other, you can do better.", "NTA, if one of my friends said what you did I would have immediatly ordered food for both of us and probably be trying to make sure they were fed the rest of the month after that. Your friend is selfish.", "Not at all.  Your friend must understand what your circumstances are.\n\nyou can expect her to show up at the first of the month to sponge off you, from now on.", "Your \u201cfriend\u201d isn\u2019t much of one.

I don\u2019t care if you did it, or your grandparents did it, higher education should be free. That\u2019s worth the tax dollars for an educated society.", "NTA \n\nIf she treats you that way, she isn't a friend. A real friend would have bought you a meal. She could afford to buy a pizza or a happy meal.", "NTA - she\u2019s the cheapskate", "NTA\n\nIf you had invited her over, it would be appropriate to offer food, but since she came unannounced, she should have no expectations like that.  NTA", "NTA. honestly, if I were close friends with someone and I had the financial possibilities, I would even propose to help out a bit or lend them some money upon hearing this situation. it\u2019s really sad.\nor at least just order some food to your friend\u2019s place. go pick up some food from the store and come back. ask beforehand if you should eat before going to her place. there\u2019s so many things you can do without being disrespectful.", "NTA you are not her fridge. You can't starve yourself to feed her, if she's so bloody hungry she can buy a pizza and get it delivered.", "NTA Privileged people really have no idea how other people struggle. You stated a fact. She did not believe you because she has never been down to 2 slices of bread and a tablespoon of peanut butter that will have to last until tomorrow.", "NTA A true friend would have asked if you were ok and then if they could afford it take you out to eat.", "Nta - wow!! So nta", "NTA not sure why she feels entitled to be fed in your home but youre fine dw", "NTA in the slightest.\n\nYour friend is apparently devoid of any empathy. \nWhen you politely explained your situation, she should have dropped it or offered to cover both of you.
