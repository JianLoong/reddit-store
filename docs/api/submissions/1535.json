A sense of smell?\n\nWas there no point during the THREE HOURS that she was creating this meal in YOUR KITCHEN that you maybe should have noticed and said, \"Hey, I can't eat any of this huge amount of meat that you seem to be preparing...\"?

But that's just my thoughts.", "I\u2019ve been vegetarian and then vegan for 18 years now and some people have to put meat in anything. My grandfather served me \u201cvegetarian\u201d mashed potatoes but there was ham in it, but \u201cthat\u2019s just a spice\u201d. Once I thought fruit salad was safe, but he had added roast beef.", "Can we also look at the fact that SIL put beef in the rice to be served with the roast chicken?

I will be making this today!", ">She did not make it in my kitchen\n\nBut she was staying with you. Did she purchase prepared foods, like restaurant takeaway?"]}
