We renovated it to make it a hobby farm again. There are three pastures: two my husband uses and the third we were repairing to use it. My ILs were aware of this.\r  \n\r  \nDuring our repairs, one of the neighbors asked my ILs about renting out the pasture because they had too many heads for the land they already had. My ILs agreed because it was the \"right\" thing to do according to their faith and it'd generate a bit more income for them before they moved. My husband and I weren't happy about it but stuck a pin in our plans to see how things played out until the end of the lease to see if something could be worked out to accommodate everyone.\r  \n\r  \nWe're now 3 months into this arrangement and it's been a nightmare. The path to the pasture goes right by our house since it's close to it. They have complained about my smoking the good stuff on my porch no matter what time I go out to smoke. They complain that I play music they don't want their kids to hear. They complain that we use our firepit which is about 50 yards from the pasture. I reached the end of my patience yesterday: When I'm getting ready in the mornings or after a shower I walk around our house nude. My ILs house isn't anywhere in sight and we're tucked off our road going through the farm so our curtains are always open. If I see the renter's truck going over before I shower I either close the curtains or just get dressed. No one was at the pasture yesterday when I took my shower and I didn't see the truck after so I just walked around the house for a while. After about 25 minutes there was a knock at the door.\r  \n\r  \nIt was the neighbors. They complained that I needed to be more considerate and 'act decent' by putting clothes on because I should be well aware by now they bring their kids with them to take care of the cattle, and they don't want their kids seeing that. Then they started about how they're paying good money to use the pasture and paid out of pocket to make it usable. I stopped them there and told them they didn't do all the work to make it usable, it was already halfway done because of my husband and me. I also told them, paraphrasing here, \"You don't own the farm, you're only renting one pasture so you've got no right to tell me what to do in and around my own house. Don't want to accidentally see something? Stop looking at our windows. If you want any chance of having your lease renewed after my husband takes over, you should stop acting so self-important, act like the people of faith you claim to be, and be nicer to me.\"\r  \n\r  \nThey told my ILs about it who took it to my husband. He\u2019s fine with what I said as he\u2019s had his own issues with them, but we\u2019re wondering if we should apologize to ILs and the neighbors to keep the peace if I handled it wrong.

They\u2019re just mad they got called out on their bullshit. NTA.", "You sound pretty darn entitled and self-important seeing as you don't own the farm either. They're still gonna be your neighbours after you take over - which hasn't happened yet - and generally it's a good idea to be on the neighbours good side. Like it or not they do currently have access and use rights to the land (and to not have their animals bothered by fire pit smoke) as renters and they only people they \"have to be nice to\" is their landlord - your inlaws.

If you want to have a working relationship with these people and your in laws then you need to apologize and work toward a solution. \n\nNow, it doesn\u2019t sound like your neighbors are wonderful either, but as tenants they likely have more rights than you do in this situation.

When you own the land, you can make those kind of statements. It's inappropriate to do so before. There were plenty of other tactics to take in dealing with them. \n\nYou are perfectly justified in being irritated about their constant complaints. You have the right to enjoy your secluded home without interference by judgemental neighbors to whom your parents are doing a favor in the first place.

If you have, then you're the AH for that alone. It's also distasteful to threaten them when the land is not yet yours or your husband's. That being said, the others are things your neighbours are blowing out of proportion. Unlike you walking around nude, the smoking, the firepit, and the music are things you can tell 'em to screw off.

My guess is you and your husband moved into an established community with defined mores. It's not shocking to me that your neighbors aren't nuts about your smoking pot on the porch, or playing loud music. And it's a good bet that these people aren't deliberate \"peepers\" either. Something happened that made either the neighbors or your kids see you nude. \n\nAnd, I get it, a big \"so what.\" Pot is legal, your music probably isn't breaking any laws, and you're allowed to walk around the house naked. But these things are uncool in the community where you've decided to settle. Surely you could make some concession to community standards? I mean, God invented ear buds for a reason. \n\nAnd finally, the \"You don't own the farm,\" line. Neither, sweetheart, do YOU. At best you're a renter, same as your neighbors are. Try sounding a tad less entitled, a little more respectful of the community, and a little more respectful of the fact that the neighbors are paying your in laws to use this land. They have certain rights.", "NTA\n\nIf I'm understanding this correctly; your husband is close to inheriting/taking over this property. Your neighbors need to respect the rules y'all lay out, so it's good to confront them before it becomes a bigger issue.", "OP probably is NTA here, but, OP also should be careful. Sure seems to me OP is assuming an awful lot, and if the IL's don't agree, her and her hubby might find themselves the odd ones out in the relationship. Especially as the IL's are people of faith, who almost certainly wouldn't appreciate OP smoking weed, drinking, walking around nude, and listening to what I assume is pretty loud and aggressive music, to have the neighbours complain about it.\n\nAll 4 of those things are something that people of faith might have some serious problems with, and OP should be careful in what assumptions she makes and what statements she utters. IL's might say \"when your husband owns it, eh? Yeah, that's not going to happen as long as you are still married to him.\"", "Edit: I've been convinced this is more of an ESH than anything else besides the In Laws.\n\nYTA. It's not your land. They are legally paying for it. None of this is your business. Deal with it when the takeover does happen if you want.", "NTA.  You're not completely in the right but not in the wrong either.  Much of the circumstances are outside of your control.  The way I see it you have two obligations here:\n\n1. **As a neighbor** you have the moral duty to be at least minimally neighborly.  Don't play music so loud it's unpleasant from their property.  Don't smoke \"the good stuff\" where they can smell it, don't expose yourself to them etc.\n2. **As a landlord** You're more the co-landlord in this which is not your choice exactly but your tangentially obligated by the terms of the lease.  In this you have the obligation to ensure they have the use of the property they paid for.  In this case they just need to keep their livestock secured and cared for which requires occasional access to the land and indefinite occupation by the livestock. etc.\n\nMy recommended course of action would be to take the easy steps to appease them.  Make sure they know you're doing this as a good faith gesture, not out of a perceived obligation.  Make sure they know this is YOUR HOME and is to be treaded as such.  That no intrusions into your personal space will be tolerated outside of what's required in your role as a neighbor and landlord.  That you will make a good-faith effort to be a good neighbor but they have no say what you do or don't do in your personal space and once they've voiced their opinion on a matter and you've heard it, the discussion on the matter is over.  In general I'd go above and beyond what's expected to be a good neighbor, but not to the point where I'm being a doormat or suffering significant impact to my quality of life.  You'll presumably have to live close to these people for some time so some effort is warranted.\n\nAs for the specifics of what to do next, I'd make them a pie, cookies, etc. as a good-faith offering and go visit them at their house.  Express that I'm sorry they have objections to the way I conduct myself in my own home but it is my home and they're not entitled to control that.  But, as a neighbor you **both** have an obligation to be neighborly.  So I'd ensure they have my phone number and tell them if they'll text me before heading to the property that you'll ensure your decent and otherwise take into account their wishes but only to a point of not being obnoxious.  If they can't respect your personal space and privacy in your own home then you'll seek to end any relationship making that a problem as soon as is convenient to do so.", "Nta.  They're crossing ask kinda of lines. There's no way I'd renew their lease.", "NTA. You seem kind of intolerant to be honest but they are very presumptuous and rude to be criticizing you so harshly when they simply rent a portion of the land from you. The fact is, no one needs to uphold this arrangement if it isn't working. You guys wouldn't be T A if you ended the agreement because you simply dislike having to share your space even with paying 'tenants'. I think your delivery left somethings to be desired, it sounded vaguely threatening and holier than thou.\n\nAnd BTW, I'm unsure of the legalities of this but people have been charged with indecent exposure inside their own homes, in certain circumstances. While you have historically been removed from others, if you now have a business arrangement with individuals who need to cross by your windows to conduct said business, you might indeed be a bit more careful about the risk of them seeing you nude.", "YTA. I don't even need to read the beyond the title, you saying anything like that is pretentious af and I would move before I ever kissed your ass to keep a lease. \n\nActing awfully entitled over land that isn't even yours. If I were the in-laws, I would probably tell y'all you need to figure out new living arrangements so that you don't create a feud with the renters.", "Yta for how you handled this. \"Please take all complaints to the land owners.\"", "You might NOT end up with that land! Your IL\u2019s might decide to sell it to them and then- you wouldn\u2019t have any say. YTA, if I was them- I\u2019d purchase the property if I could and give you walking papers. YTA", "YTA. You sound like an inconsiderate neighbor. They\u2019re paying for where they live. You live for free. Humble yourself.", "NTA, but I'd make sure that whatever agreement your husband has with his parents is in writing because they're not acting like people who plan on handing anything over.", "The neighbors sounds like jerks who should mind their own business. NTA", "LOL.....NTA.\n\nWhat nerve!  They're ***leasing*** a pasture and want to have input into what happens around it?  That's when you bring out the thong bikini and lay out.  With a pitcher of wine, music blasting, and roaches nearby.\n\nEdit to say: double check on the notification laws regarding agricultural leases.  Where I'm from, folks have to be notified by a certain date that the landowner will not be continuing with the current lease-holder.  If deadline missed, you're locked in with the same people.

The parents can't work the farm anymore and asked them to move on the pand and help out.\n\nOP's husband is managing the farm and handling all the accounts, and OP is helping out.\n\nOP's husband & BIl have set up an account that they both are putting in money to support their parents in retirement.\n\nThe farm is now their permanent resdence, and they are working on fixing the farm up and managing it.\n\nYeesh.", "I hope they long lease lol. \n\nImagine how infuriated she would be, to realise they got an extended land lease that they cannot back out of even when hubby inherits. \n\nIt'd be delicious.", "But you don\u2019t own it YET and that\u2019s the point. Sure they\u2019re being annoying but you\u2019re being presumptive and wilfully difficult over something you don\u2019t own or control.", "Your IL\u2019s were wanting to collect income off their property. They said they were being \u201cpestered\u201d so they could speed up the process with you. Like I\u2019ve said the tenant is often the pain sponge for the landlord. You both can blame him so there is less conflict between you.\n\nIf he was truly annoying your IL\u2019s they would have told him no.\n\nOf course he didn\u2019t fix the property out of the goodness of his heart. He needed it to be operational. That still takes time and money. He was obviously more motivated than you to get it done", "1) I said ESH\n2) OP is not the landlord.\n3) You have no idea what the deal was. The landowners made the deal.\n4) The landlords sided with the tenants", "I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ve rented plenty of farms that needed some work. The farm increases in value because of me and I\u2019ll be lucky if I recoup my cost. On its surface it\u2019s a bad deal for the tenant. But hopefully it builds a good relationship with the landlord and you do business with them for years.\n\nOP is NOT the landowner. I can not tell you how often the family of a landowner thinks they are in charge. Tenant is often the pain sponge for the landlord. Keeps the family from arguing with each other.", "They are renting a pasture but they have their own land.", "I also agree with the comment but disagree with both of your verdicts - NTA. Handling this sub-optimally doesn\u2019t make OP an AH. The neighbors are still on a campaign of pointless harassment against someone just trying to live her life.", "The question isn\u2019t what\u2019s allowed. The question is what\u2019s being an asshole. Those aren\u2019t the same thing.", "Hey, buddy: The community is conservative enough that the faith of at least two of the couples involved is mentioned. It's conservative enough that people are complaining about music and about pot. True peepers do NOT come to your house and say, \"I can see you naked.\" It is NOT the OP's property. Maybe look up \"hypothetical.\" Have a great day.", "Pretty much. They are actually paying to use the land. If I was paying rent to use somebodies land, I would expect I should be able to use the land without  the actual landowners entitled daughter in law smoking pot near my kids, walking around naked passing open windows, and playing vulgar music loud enough for them to hear. \n\nBeing asked not to do shit like that isn't a huge ask of anyone. It almost comes across as daughter in law purposefully making them uncomfortable because her and hubby weren't happy that the in-laws decided to rent the pasture for some actual money. Instead of letting them use it for their hobbies.", "No she wants them gone so she can use that pasture herself.", "It\u2019s NOT their own property though", "It's no so much MUSIC, it's the words. They are complaining that OP doesn't play \"godly christian\" music and may have a song on with words they don't like.", "I fully agree. I was trying to think of the urban equivalent, in my neighborhood some apartments will rent parking spots to other houses. If someone rented one behind my apartment and they bitched that I was smoking/listening to loud music when they had to park I would probably just laugh at them", "No they will not own it anymore, everything will be transferred to my husband.", "Well, pigs will eat just about anything.", "I will certainly take the window coverings into consideration, thanks for the suggestion!", "I am going to, but the commentator also stated some things in their response that were inaccurate and I gave clarification, such as the issues with the music and pot aren't because they can smell/hear from their house, but when driving by my house or in the pasture. If they could hear the music from their house 2 miles away I absolutely would understand and keep it down.\n\nJust as the suggestion was made that the neighbors be asked to call to give warning they're coming, and that avenue has been tried and denied by them. I have no problem at all with apologizing to my in-laws and will be doing so.", "The post you mentioned gave some suggestions, but considering that the renters do not live nearby they are not really applicable.  I'm not sure why you don't seem to agree that OP has the right to enjoy their music and house as they please without the input of people who DO NOT LIVE THERE.", "1. OP isn't ESH because they live their life in their home\n\n2. If we are ignoring that OP has a home on the land and the entire family is operating under the assumption that the land will be passed on....then shouldn't the tenant have went to the landlord to begin with instead of harassing OP?\n\n\n3. Presumably OP does, since they say the tenants are only entitled to one of the parcels\n\n4. Where'd you get that from? The parents passed on the complaint to the husband, and the husband supports OP. Where does it say how the parents feel?\n\nIf anything them passing the buck to the son just shows they're disinvolved with the land and let their son manage it.", "Yeah, and the land that the neighbors own is two miles from OP's house, so they probably wouldn't be affected by it that much.", "The fire pit was there first? They also complain about the weed when they don't have the kids with them. I can be smoking while they pull up and they complain. I can't wear noise-cancelling headphones when working with equipment or animals, kind of a big safety concern. But I'm supposed to turn it off and stop working because they don't like electronic and dance regardless of whether or not their kids are with them. Hence why if I know they're at the pasture, I close the curtains or cover up. Yet their demands are I just not do any of it, because they could be there at any time.", "Idk why you\u2019re being downvoted cause these are all legitimate requests.", "OP is definitely an AH for threatening lease renewal on land she and her husband don\u2019t even own.", "And clearly the majority consensus is that  constantly telling someone they have to abide by your personal religious standards is more asinine than telling them to harassing you over some weed", "Yeah, and expecting your home to be your home where you aren\u2019t bothered by people who are renting land separate from that home is not being an asshole", ">I'm guessing\n\nThat's hypocritical, the story mentions two families and you're using that to guess about an entire community\n\nAnd the idea that you have to conform with the community you live in is plain wrong", "You seem to be completely misunderstanding what happened in this post. OP has been topless inside her own home, smoking on her own porch, and using a fire pit on her property. The neighbors are renting a field that puts them about 50 yards away from all this, and have been complaining about her and to her.\n\nYou thinks she\u2019s an asshole for telling people off after they repeatedly harassed her?", "No, but it is her family\u2019s property and her *home*", "Guess it's time to play some Andrew Dice Clay, then.", "You better hope they don't decide to sell that pasture to their church friends.", "No, this is the first time they talked to my ILs, all other times they spoke to me directly. My ILs are concerned about church gossip regarding the neighbors.", "In town? Probably not, but I understand that some people are that full of it.  In the country, out of sight and away from your property?  Hell no. Why would you think of doing that?", "The commenter never said OP is an AH for how they live their life. They said OP is an AH for throwing the work they did in the renters\u2019 face like that somehow negates the time and labor the renters put into the land. It was a dick move by OP.", "maybe bc he had to embellish a bunch of shit not from the post to make them \u2018legitimate\u2019 as you say?", "I didn\u2019t say he was a nice guy either. Amending my vote to ESH.", "She's trying to push people off land she does not own yet. my understanding is in laws own the land. She is the one threatening to kick them off after the takeover. The takeover has not occurred yet.", "Because they\u2019re paying for the land and she doesn\u2019t own the land. If they have a problem they need to take it up with the landowner. If she has a problem with the renters, she needs to take it up with the landowner. her threatening people she has no legal standing over is going to cause far more issues than keeping her mouth shut and waiting until she owns the land and terminating the contract", "Yes. Exactly it\u2019s not hers. Even when the husband inherits it. It IS NOT HERS. Pretty sure if I any of us was smoking weed and being naked often our neighbours and agencies would ALSO complain. It\u2019s the real world. Not her property.", "I would put NWA & Public Enemy on repeat.  Yes I am old", "I was thinking about Ozzy Osbourne because for people like that, he's practically Satan's Number One.\n\nDespite y'know the fact that he's Christian and literally prays before his concerts. So, actually more godly than probably most of what they listen to.", "That's a perfectly good response considering the tenants started with:\n\n>Then they started about how they're paying good money to use the pasture and paid out of pocket to make it usable.\n\nThey're the ones that need the land and approached the land owners to rent it. Whayever they're paying and whatever improvements they made are because they need it. Then they throw that at OPs face because of nudity in her own home, or music and pot on her own porch.", "Thank you! I didn\u2019t mention why the neighbors were AHs because it was self explanatory. OP has every right to do what she wants in her home.", "That\u2019s a funny pair of sentences, but I\u2019m glad to hear it! I still disagree with that but not enough to fight about lol", "She\u2019s suggesting the the neighbors should act more neighborly, because they\u2019ve been constantly harassing her for how she behaves in and around her home.", "You can't read, stop talking. \n\n\n\nThe issues came from the renters harassing the property owners over OP. \n\n\nThey only got threatened after demanding OP obey their demands in her own home.\n\n\nAlso, if she lives on the same property as the pasture, those people harassing her are in more trouble than her, because even though they're renting, they have no right to make continuous and spurious harass campaigns as they have been. \n\n\nSo again, learn to read, then speak.", "She\u2019s in the middle of nowhere and you expect her to change her living habits, in her own home, to cater to some entitled peeping toms?\n\nLike OP said - if they don\u2019t want to see her naked, stop looking in her windows. I have no sympathy for anyone triggered by smelling weed *outside*. These people don\u2019t even live on the property but want to dictate how the actual habitants of the property live their lives? Give me a break.", "It\u2019s where she lives. Whether or not she owns it is entirely irrelevant bc the people who do own it allow her to live there & allow her to do what she does on the property. You trying to force this distinction when it doesn\u2019t even matter is weird", "I love how you assume your husband's brother won't get an interest in the farm.", "Nah. Kick them the fuck out when your husband inherits the land. They act like shitbags because they never have consequences and hide behind religion. Fuck them.", "The tenants are AHs, OP was an AH right back. Justified or not, they both suck.", "Usually I don\u2019t bother to read or respond to comments arguing against my comments because I\u2019m aware that, odds are, I end up debating with someone who goes to high school, but I happened to see yours. In a civilized society, we work to cohabit peacefully. We don\u2019t play super loud music when we know people are trying to sleep, we don\u2019t smoke weed outside when there are other people around (I\u2019m a HEAVY weed smoker because of severe and chronic knee pain but I have self control). Kindness is better than being snarky, I think.", "Who owns her home? Is that under the in laws as well?", "OP and spouse are NOT the property owners owners.

They are renting a WORKSPACE next to her home (where they\u2019ve said they\u2019re bringing children) and providing income to her in laws. Any person would be respectful of that, surely. As and when op actually owns the land then she can dictate to the renters where to shove their complaints. Until then she doesn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. \n\nIdk how you can think OP is completely devoid of any responsibility to be a good neighbour to them whilst they are paying the in laws. She\u2019s just being petty because she didn\u2019t want them to rent out the pasture. But AS ITS NOT HER DAMN PROPERTY and therefore didn\u2019t have a vote the in laws did it anyway.", "He won't, he has no interest in moving back to the farm or anything to do with it. Only thing he asks is that if any of his kids wind up interested that they be allowed to come out and visit for long holidays.", "Why is that a weird assumption? Sounds like the BIL doesn\u2019t live on the farm or run the farm. It\u2019s common to leave the family business to the children who entered it, and any other assets (cash, retirement accounts, vehicles, valuables, etc.) to the other children. What\u2019s BIL going to do with a farm?", "Nope, responding in kind after being harassed multiple times in your home does not make you an AH.\n\nThat's just something we disagree on.", "All of those are great. Also have nothing to do with living rurally on a farm? The renters don\u2019t LIVE there. They come to work with cattle. Are you not allowed to play loud music during the day in the city? Yep. You sure are. Are you allowed to smoke on your own deck in the city? Yep. Yep you are. \n\nKindness is great\u2026. It\u2019s also a privilege. The renters lost that privilege when they started trying to dictate what OP does in her own home that literally doesn\u2019t affect them at all.", "Does it matter? Whether or not she owns it it\u2019s her home. Her legal residence. And neighbors are trying to police her morality while she resides there. As you\u2019ve been insisting already, tenants have rights. That includes against harassment by religious neighbors.", "To obtain residents rights, you don't need to own the domicile. \n\n\nEither have legal ID with the address, stay there for a certain period of time and/or pay a certain amount, or some combination of the 3. \n\n\nThose pasture renters are harassing OP. \n\nShe's well within her rights to call the cops to start a paper trail so she can get a civil court resolution.", "My husband is inheriting it when my IL's move to live with his brother. That's in the next couple of years, they're just waiting on BIL's house to be finished."]}
