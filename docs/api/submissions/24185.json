{"id": 24185, "submission_id": "15lmt82", "title": "AITA for telling the people renting land from my in-laws they should be nicer to me if they want to keep renting when my husband takes over the lease?", "selftext": "My husband and I, and his parents, live on their farm. We renovated it to make it a hobby farm again. There are three pastures: two my husband uses and the third we were repairing to use it. My ILs were aware of this.\r  \n\r  \nDuring our repairs, one of the neighbors asked my ILs about renting out the pasture because they had too many heads for the land they already had. My ILs agreed because it was the \"right\" thing to do according to their faith and it'd generate a bit more income for them before they moved. My husband and I weren't happy about it but stuck a pin in our plans to see how things played out until the end of the lease to see if something could be worked out to accommodate everyone.\r  \n\r  \nWe're now 3 months into this arrangement and it's been a nightmare. The path to the pasture goes right by our house since it's close to it. They have complained about my smoking the good stuff on my porch no matter what time I go out to smoke. They complain that I play music they don't want their kids to hear. They complain that we use our firepit which is about 50 yards from the pasture. I reached the end of my patience yesterday: When I'm getting ready in the mornings or after a shower I walk around our house nude. My ILs house isn't anywhere in sight and we're tucked off our road going through the farm so our curtains are always open. If I see the renter's truck going over before I shower I either close the curtains or just get dressed. No one was at the pasture yesterday when I took my shower and I didn't see the truck after so I just walked around the house for a while. After about 25 minutes there was a knock at the door.\r  \n\r  \nIt was the neighbors. They complained that I needed to be more considerate and 'act decent' by putting clothes on because I should be well aware by now they bring their kids with them to take care of the cattle, and they don't want their kids seeing that. Then they started about how they're paying good money to use the pasture and paid out of pocket to make it usable. I stopped them there and told them they didn't do all the work to make it usable, it was already halfway done because of my husband and me. I also told them, paraphrasing here, \"You don't own the farm, you're only renting one pasture so you've got no right to tell me what to do in and around my own house. Don't want to accidentally see something? Stop looking at our windows. If you want any chance of having your lease renewed after my husband takes over, you should stop acting so self-important, act like the people of faith you claim to be, and be nicer to me.\"\r  \n\r  \nThey told my ILs about it who took it to my husband. He\u2019s fine with what I said as he\u2019s had his own issues with them, but we\u2019re wondering if we should apologize to ILs and the neighbors to keep the peace if I handled it wrong.

They\u2019re just mad they got called out on their bullshit. NTA.", "You sound pretty darn entitled and self-important seeing as you don't own the farm either. They're still gonna be your neighbours after you take over - which hasn't happened yet - and generally it's a good idea to be on the neighbours good side. Like it or not they do currently have access and use rights to the land (and to not have their animals bothered by fire pit smoke) as renters and they only people they \"have to be nice to\" is their landlord - your inlaws. YTA just for the attitude. Maybe they have a point about your smoking etc.", "YTA. \n\nIt does sound like a nightmare but not for the reason you think.\n\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way: you\u2019re not doing what you want on your property.

If you want to have a working relationship with these people and your in laws then you need to apologize and work toward a solution. \n\nNow, it doesn\u2019t sound like your neighbors are wonderful either, but as tenants they likely have more rights than you do in this situation. So it\u2019s time for you to stand back and eat some humble pie.", "When has \"you better be nice to me or else\" NOT been YTA kind of move? When you own the land, you can make those kind of statements. It's inappropriate to do so before. There were plenty of other tactics to take in dealing with them. \n\nYou are perfectly justified in being irritated about their constant complaints. You have the right to enjoy your secluded home without interference by judgemental neighbors to whom your parents are doing a favor in the first place.

If you have, then you're the AH for that alone. It's also distasteful to threaten them when the land is not yet yours or your husband's. That being said, the others are things your neighbours are blowing out of proportion. Unlike you walking around nude, the smoking, the firepit, and the music are things you can tell 'em to screw off.

My guess is you and your husband moved into an established community with defined mores. It's not shocking to me that your neighbors aren't nuts about your smoking pot on the porch, or playing loud music. And it's a good bet that these people aren't deliberate \"peepers\" either. Something happened that made either the neighbors or your kids see you nude. \n\nAnd, I get it, a big \"so what.\" Pot is legal, your music probably isn't breaking any laws, and you're allowed to walk around the house naked. But these things are uncool in the community where you've decided to settle. Surely you could make some concession to community standards? I mean, God invented ear buds for a reason. \n\nAnd finally, the \"You don't own the farm,\" line. Neither, sweetheart, do YOU. At best you're a renter, same as your neighbors are. Try sounding a tad less entitled, a little more respectful of the community, and a little more respectful of the fact that the neighbors are paying your in laws to use this land. They have certain rights.", "NTA\n\nIf I'm understanding this correctly; your husband is close to inheriting/taking over this property. Your neighbors need to respect the rules y'all lay out, so it's good to confront them before it becomes a bigger issue.", "OP probably is NTA here, but, OP also should be careful. Sure seems to me OP is assuming an awful lot, and if the IL's don't agree, her and her hubby might find themselves the odd ones out in the relationship. Especially as the IL's are people of faith, who almost certainly wouldn't appreciate OP smoking weed, drinking, walking around nude, and listening to what I assume is pretty loud and aggressive music, to have the neighbours complain about it.\n\nAll 4 of those things are something that people of faith might have some serious problems with, and OP should be careful in what assumptions she makes and what statements she utters. IL's might say \"when your husband owns it, eh? Yeah, that's not going to happen as long as you are still married to him.\"", "YTA. It's not your land. They are legally paying for it. None of this is your business. Deal with it when the takeover does happen if you want.", "NTA.  You're not completely in the right but not in the wrong either.  Much of the circumstances are outside of your control.  The way I see it you have two obligations here:\n\n1. **As a neighbor** you have the moral duty to be at least minimally neighborly.  Don't play music so loud it's unpleasant from their property.  Don't smoke \"the good stuff\" where they can smell it, don't expose yourself to them etc.\n2. **As a landlord** You're more the co-landlord in this which is not your choice exactly but your tangentially obligated by the terms of the lease.  In this you have the obligation to ensure they have the use of the property they paid for.  In this case they just need to keep their livestock secured and cared for which requires occasional access to the land and indefinite occupation by the livestock. etc.\n\nMy recommended course of action would be to take the easy steps to appease them.  Make sure they know you're doing this as a good faith gesture, not out of a perceived obligation.  Make sure they know this is YOUR HOME and is to be treaded as such.  That no intrusions into your personal space will be tolerated outside of what's required in your role as a neighbor and landlord.  That you will make a good-faith effort to be a good neighbor but they have no say what you do or don't do in your personal space and once they've voiced their opinion on a matter and you've heard it, the discussion on the matter is over.  In general I'd go above and beyond what's expected to be a good neighbor, but not to the point where I'm being a doormat or suffering significant impact to my quality of life.  You'll presumably have to live close to these people for some time so some effort is warranted.\n\nAs for the specifics of what to do next, I'd make them a pie, cookies, etc. as a good-faith offering and go visit them at their house.  Express that I'm sorry they have objections to the way I conduct myself in my own home but it is my home and they're not entitled to control that.  But, as a neighbor you **both** have an obligation to be neighborly.  So I'd ensure they have my phone number and tell them if they'll text me before heading to the property that you'll ensure your decent and otherwise take into account their wishes but only to a point of not being obnoxious.  If they can't respect your personal space and privacy in your own home then you'll seek to end any relationship making that a problem as soon as is convenient to do so.", "Nta.  They're crossing ask kinda of lines. There's no way I'd renew their lease.", "NTA. You seem kind of intolerant to be honest but they are very presumptuous and rude to be criticizing you so harshly when they simply rent a portion of the land from you. The fact is, no one needs to uphold this arrangement if it isn't working. You guys wouldn't be T A if you ended the agreement because you simply dislike having to share your space even with paying 'tenants'. I think your delivery left somethings to be desired, it sounded vaguely threatening and holier than thou.\n\nAnd BTW, I'm unsure of the legalities of this but people have been charged with indecent exposure inside their own homes, in certain circumstances. While you have historically been removed from others, if you now have a business arrangement with individuals who need to cross by your windows to conduct said business, you might indeed be a bit more careful about the risk of them seeing you nude.", "YTA. I don't even need to read the beyond the title, you saying anything like that is pretentious af and I would move before I ever kissed your ass to keep a lease. \n\nActing awfully entitled over land that isn't even yours. If I were the in-laws, I would probably tell y'all you need to figure out new living arrangements so that you don't create a feud with the renters.", "Yta for how you handled this. \"Please take all complaints to the land owners.\"", "You might NOT end up with that land! Your IL\u2019s might decide to sell it to them and then- you wouldn\u2019t have any say. YTA, if I was them- I\u2019d purchase the property if I could and give you walking papers. YTA", "YTA. You sound like an inconsiderate neighbor. They\u2019re paying for where they live. You live for free. Humble yourself.", "NTA, but I'd make sure that whatever agreement your husband has with his parents is in writing because they're not acting like people who plan on handing anything over.", "The neighbors sounds like jerks who should mind their own business. NTA", "LOL.....NTA.\n\nWhat nerve!  They're ***leasing*** a pasture and want to have input into what happens around it?  That's when you bring out the thong bikini and lay out.  With a pitcher of wine, music blasting, and roaches nearby.\n\nEdit to say: double check on the notification laws regarding agricultural leases.  Where I'm from, folks have to be notified by a certain date that the landowner will not be continuing with the current lease-holder.  If deadline missed, you're locked in with the same people.

So she\u2019s not only upsetting the neighbors, but her ILs possibly. If she keeps being a nuisance the ILs might kick them out/start making them pay rent/or sell the pasture to the neighbors to prevent her from using the possibility of ownership to get her way", "The price of eggs is as relevant to the field rental as OP dancing around nude or smoking pot.\n\nIe none at all", "It's literally OP's Husband's property.

Do you do that at your house?", "How is people complaining to her about everything she does not her business?!?", "For real. She already explained how isolated their house is.", "Probably. While I would recommend being a bit more diplomatic with these neighbors, it's effectively your Husband's land, and whether it's today or next year, you're gonna start managing it as such.", "No it\u2019s not?", "While his parents own it they are in control of the land. And who it eventually goes to.", "I don't think I would. The neighbors aren't paying to LIVE there, they are paying to use the pasture presumably for farming. I'd be more likely to not bring my child there than to criticize those who live nearby. People should be free to do what they want, within reason, on their own property and I put smoking dope and playing music I don't like on that list. I do realize both have potential to impact others nearby but should a neighbor be in a position to tell someone else they can't smoke or listen to music because it offends the neighbor?", "No it\u2019s not, it\u2019s the parents property. They just live there. That\u2019s why the neighbors go to the parents about complaints or renting.", "It\u2019s literally not her husband\u2019s property.

And I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be just as good of a landlord as they are a neighbor. She\u2019s trying to flex power she doesn\u2019t even have yet.

Indecent exposure laws don\u2019t hinge on you exposing yourself for sexual reasons, it just hinges on you exposing yourself. You have the reading comprehension of a walnut. The part you quotes just mean factors of children or nudity meant to arouse will have different levels of consequences than nudity like this. If I take my top off only because it\u2019s hot, I will still get In legal trouble for indecent exposure, even though it\u2019s not sexually motivated. It\u2019s saying Ones with kids or sexual motivations are more clear cut, duh. Because that\u2019s p*dophilia and sexual assault. What you quote in no way states that those are the only stipulations to making it illegal.
