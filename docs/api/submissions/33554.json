A few weeks ago one of her teachers asked them to create a children's book. \n\nMy daughter has a very good imagination, she wants to be a writer when she grows up and she is pretty good at it. Her favorite books are the goosebumps series. \n\nSo when her teacher gave them this assignment, she decided to write a book similar to the goosebumps. I'm not gonna say it was perfect because she is just a kid but it was a decent book and I was proud of her when I read it. She also found a notebook with the picture of a girl on it and decided to write the story on that notebook and chose the girl to be the main character in the story. \n\nWell a week ago she came home, crying her eyes out. Apparently the teacher chewed her out when she saw her story. She basically told her that her story is the worst one in their class. \n\nI comforted my daughter however it has been a week and she hasn't been writing anything. She used to write a lot of stories but she has lost interest. \n\nI was really angry so I decided to meet the teacher and I told her she owes my daughter an apology and needs to compliment her book. \n\nShe said she will not be doing that as my daughter did an awful job. According to her my daughter should have created a cover instead of using a notebook and called her lazy for not putting any effort in it and also according to her a children's book needs pictures and my daughter didn't do that. She told me that my daughter got a D in this assignment and she won't get an apology for being \"lazy\". \n\nMy daughter spent 2 weeks working on that story and it's details. She is in no way lazy. \n\nI called the teacher a bitch and told her she has no right to talk about my child that way or treat her like that. She called me an asshole and asked me to leave", "created_utc": 1703251322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18oesry/aita_for_confronting_my_daughters_teacher/", "score": 1641, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019d expect that for a big project like this, there should have been a clear description of the assignment, maybe even a handout with all of the requirements on it.  You should ask about that and see whether your daughter\u2019s story actually met the assignment criteria before you talk to the teacher.  It sounds like the assignment may have specified making a cover and pictures.\n\nIf you jumped down the teacher\u2019s throat before verifying that your daughter actually did the assignment, then you\u2019re majorly at fault.  If you went at the teacher even though she didn\u2019t do the assignment properly, you\u2019re in the wrong there, too.", "Info: were the requirements for the project clear and did the teacher provide written feedback to explain the poor grade?", "YTA for creating like three fake accounts to defend yourself in the comments rather than replying yourself, and trying to pretend they\u2019re not you.  \n\nAlso YTA, because I find it very hard to believe that this teacher didn\u2019t either provide your daughter with a rubric describing the requirements for the assignment and how it would be graded, or a model of what a completed version should look like.  Every time I have assigned students a project of any kind, I had my own version of how a completed one should look, which I then modeled the steps of creating so they could see how to do it correctly.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that your daughter\u2019s teacher is just wildly negligent, but it is much, **much** more likely that your daughter just didn\u2019t pay attention to what she was supposed to do for the assignment, and did something else.  And her teacher is holding her accountable for that.\n\nJudging by the attitude you\u2019ve shown in your comments, not taking responsibility for oneself is something she learned at home.", "ESH\n\nYou should not have called your daughter's teacher a \"bitch.\"  That is uncalled for.   However, I agree that your daughter's teacher is terrible, but by calling her a \"bitch,\" you entirely changed the tone of the conflict into one of name-calling instead of one of the teacher grading improperly.  The assignment was about the story, not about the cover or pictures within, and at your daughter's age, teacher should have just returned the story to her and asked her to do a better job on the cover and add some pictures if she is able and resubmit.  This is not for publication.\n\nThis kind of criticism from teachers can destroy the creative aspirations of a sensitive and artistic child.  Teachers in these kinds of areas - not math or science, but creative, artistic areas - should be nurturing.  Correct mistakes, yes, but do not squash a child's creative potential with belittling criticism.  If this is the way this teacher runs her classes, she probably should not be working with children.  You might want to bring this to the attention of her superiors at the school, but again, calling the teacher a bitch complicates this option.", "YTA. The fact that you created multiple accounts to defend yourself here tells us all we need to know.", "Info. \n\nWas there a rubric of any kind that your daughter had access to?\n\nBecause I taught middle school.  And let me tell you, sometimes what kids would turn in for a project, and what the assignment was, was pretty different.  She may have spent a long time doing it, that doesn't mean she did it right.  \n\nAlso, how specifically did the teacher \"chew her out\".   Again, as a former teacher, I can tell you that what is actually said, and what middle school kids hear aren't always the same.   \n\nI can see a situation where the teacher was possibly harsher than was warranted, but it also sounds like you went in guns blazing because your baby got her fee fees hurt. \n\nFinally, I will say as a parent, you are not at all objective about how good your kids work is.  \n\nHaving dealt with parents like you, I'm leaning toward YTA, but I'm also not going to completey disregard that the teacher could've been out of line.", "INFO: when the project was given, was creating a front page and including pictures part of the instructions?", "I\u2019m leaning ESH. It sounds like the assignment required a cover and illustrations. If your daughter didn\u2019t hit the requirements then it impacts her grade. At 6th grade part of the learning of this kind of big project is learning to hit the requirements. That said, I don\u2019t think the teacher helped your daughter understand that. It was taken as the story wasn\u2019t good, which is a problem. Your daughter has abandoned, at least for now, something she loves because of the teacher\u2019s reaction. Unfortunately, your reaction comes across as anger that your special snowflake shouldn\u2019t be told her work didn\u2019t meet the criteria for a good grade.", "What was the assignment specifically? Just, write a children's book, or was there more detail? If the requirements of the assignment included illustrations, and cover art, then YTA. If the assignment was just \"write a children's book\" then she is the asshole for grading on undisclosed requirements. Not all children's books are picture books.", "You don't get to tell a teacher she has to compliment your daughter, that's over stepping and not your call. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter didn't follow the assignment instructions. \n\nBoth the alleged adults handled this badly. \n\nEsh", "Reminds me of this one time I gave my students the assignment to write their own fairy tale. We spoke in detail about the characteristics of this specific type of literature and read + discussed many examples in our lessons for 2 weeks and also spoke about the requirements of the assignment. Needed to have all the typical characteristics of a classic fairy tale, should be 1 - 2 pages max, should have a fitting title and the kids had to draw a picture of one scene. \n\nEveryone did great but one kid. He handed me a 7 pages sci-fi story instead. I gave him what would be a D- in the US. I could have given him a F but I gave him some credit for writing something even if it was not at all what the assignment was about. \n\nThe mother came to school and screamed at me for being \"on a power trip\" and \"getting joy from humiliating kids\". Teaching is such a fun job sometimes. \n\nYTA, even if the teachers decision was questionable your behavior still makes you TA.", "YTA. Every other student managed to do cover art and pictures except your daughter. Weird that apparently they all knew to do that. Sounds like those instructions were given. As someone who tended to daydream during school I missed things and it\u2019s much easier to blame the teacher than take responsibility at 11. \nI\u2019ve also never heard a teacher talk to a student like that in front of the class. Things are much more dramatic in our heads at that age. Next time you try talking to someone don\u2019t go in assuming your daughter is perfect and the other person messed up.", "Folks it is obvious this woman is unhinged and lying. It\u2019s best we all ignore her. She\u2019s created several account to respond. It\u2019s best we all step alway and just ignore her. The daughter either didn\u2019t listen or was lazy or both. It\u2019s simple. This woman has made a name for herself at the school and now she and her precious little squashed cabbage leaf are blacklisted. It\u2019s done. YTA.", "You demanded your daughter get a compliment? For a failed assignment? How embarrassing lol. Congrats on your new label of \"trouble parent\" at that entire school. YTA", "ESH. But your daughter was told to write a children\u2019s book not fill a notebook with the story.", "YTA \n\nSounds like there were clear stipulations for the assignment and your kid didn\u2019t do them. \nNo way there wasn\u2019t a rubric. \n\nThe teacher needed to show you that rubric and not say it was the \u201cworst in the class\u201d\u2026if she did say that. Which I don\u2019t think she did", "Dr Seuss was rejected by 27 publishers before finding someone to take a chance on him. Stephen king had trouble getting published. Hell even Agatha Christie struggled. You should be teaching your daughter how to react positively to criticism, the teacher even laid out what was wrong and how to improve it.\n\nYTA for insulting the teacher, and not teaching your daughter how to handle rejection properly.", "YTA.\n\nMost of the other commenters asked the important question about the scope of the assignment vs. what your daughter decided to do, so I\u2019ll leave that part.\n\nI\u2019m a teacher, and while I have met some horrible folks in my profession, it is hard for me to imagine a teacher telling a child that their project submission was the worst one in the class, calling the child lazy, and especially calling you the parent an a-hole. I\u2019m not saying that didn\u2019t happen, but it\u2019s hard for me to imagine because teachers can get in such huge trouble for comments like that.\n\nAlso\u2026I don\u2019t know how else to say this but, demanding a teacher compliment your child\u2019s work is not it. The teacher\u2019s job is to educate your kid, provide constructive feedback, push them to learn and grow and improve. Demanding a compliment feels like an overstep in boundaries to me. \n\nThis is already too long so I\u2019ll leave with this- when situation like this happen, I strongly recommend that as a parent you go into these conversations asking lots of questions instead of jumping to defense mode. I know it\u2019s hard when you\u2019re looking at your child hurting\u2026but trust me. Ask that teacher questions and learn as much as you can about what was expected, what was submitted, what conversations were had between teacher and kid\u2026ask ask ask, THEN decide how you want to proceed.\n\nIf you still feel the teacher is in the wrong, request to have admin brought in. At the end of the day the goal should be to partner with the adults who watch over your baby girl everyday. Work with them as much as possible toward the best interest of your child.\n\nHope this works out for you.", "Obviously the details of the assignment are crucial, but I'd say YTA either way. I remember being a kid and our maths teacher cooked up the details of a project. Incredibly frustrating and I got very wound up about it. But mistakes happen, that's life and that's part of the learning.", "It would have been so different if you went into the meeting asking questions. How did the teacher get the idea your daughter was lazy? Were there days in school she was supposed to be working on the assignments that she didn\u2019t use? I\u2019m a teacher myself and I can\u2019t tell you how many students hear of an assignment and decide what they want to do, or to do their favorite parts, do it all at home, and ignore the directions while sitting in class during those work days, assuming that their passion alone will carry the assignments through.\n\n I made that mistake often as a student- letting my creativity and the joy of it lead me away from the rubric which clearly stated, \u201cfive pages, two pictures, must have title, etc etc.\u201d I too was crushed when the story I spent two weeks writing ended up as a C or D. But it was nearly always because I chose to do my own thing. And I was often hurt my teacher \u201cdidn\u2019t like it\u201d because how could they give me a D if they did?\n\n Your daughter has to learn creativity alone isn\u2019t going to get good grades. You need to follow directions. And I can\u2019t believe there were no other directions. I think that would have been my first question to the teacher. Because if there truly were none you can escalate it to admin\n\nI suppose it\u2019s possible you have a poor teacher. They exist. But you and that teacher have a responsibility to try to understand each other and work together for the good of your daughter. I think my verdict is ESH.", ">I was really angry so I decided to meet the teacher and I told her she owes my daughter an apology and needs to compliment her book.\n\nThat is just absurd ask. Asking to see how it was graded or what exactly was assigned task would be one thing. This is something another.\n\nApparently, the task was not just about writing the story, but about actually crafting the book. Maybe the kid did not understood requirements or it just did not cared about anything except story itself. Explaining to the teacher would be fine, demanding compliments is almost funny.", "Info: well wait a minute\u2026 was the assignment to create a children\u2019s book or a young adult book? Because those are two different things. Little kids won\u2019t read a goosebumps type story. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know of any teacher who would call a parent an asshole. This doesn\u2019t feel real.", "Yeah YTA. You shouldn\u2019t be calling your child\u2019s teacher a bitch in any situation. Also your teacher does not need to compliment the child\u2019s book at all, as it will seem fake and won\u2019t be beneficial for the child. Also, you\u2019ve made life more difficult for the girl now. She will probably be known as the kid with the crazy mom, and won\u2019t be given correct feedback to avoid conflict. My mother works in a school, and  parents who behave like you are generally despised. I also wanted to write when I was her age, getting good feedback has helped me grow. And please do not attack me with several false accounts, and accept criticism. Maybe you should work on your behaviour and ability to accept criticism", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like the assignment was not to write a novel or story, but to write a children's book. This means it was only, in part, a creative writing assignment. It was equal parts an art project. Your daughter skipped the art part completely. This would suggest she only scored 50% for this assignment even if her writing was top notch. \n\nNeither you nor the teacher communicated appropriately with eachother or with (in the teacher's case) your daughter. There are respectful ways of communicating disagreement. It sounds like the assignment was not made clear to you or your daughter. An initial failure in clear communication lead to your own failure in communication. \n\nThe two adults should work harder on communication. I suggest asking the principal to mediate between the two of you in the future if you're not capable of respectful communication.", "YTA, seems like your daughter had just done what she wanted, not the task she was given and then cried after getting a poor grade. Teacher is also at fault for her methods.\nI don\u2019t like school as an institution at all, but I also don\u2019t like spoiled people who cry after being criticised for deliberately not doing what they had to do.", "Esh- you because you're calling people names, grow up. The teacher didn't have to act like that about a child not following directions. She didn't complete the assignment correctly, but gotdamn.", "I\u2019m going to need someone to find out if a rubric was actually given out lol. It seems so unlikely there were NO instructions at all. Just a teacher saying \u201cmake a children\u2019s book.\u201d If that\u2019s the truth it wouldn\u2019t even be an assignment would it? Seems more like extra credit with no instructions. \n\nAs a kid at one point, I remember lying to my parents a TON when I got bad grades. Like literally out of my ass lol. But then I would eventually be caught red handed bc there was always a rubric or detailed instructions that layed out exactly what you were being graded on. Usually you would be graded per category so you could see exactly what points you were receiving. \n\nNot saying OPs kid is stretching the truth here but this sounds exactly like the type of thing I would\u2019ve said after not reading my assignments instructions, turning in said assignment, then receiving a D on it. \n\nSide note, I think I was lazy and uninterested as a kid in elementary and middle school. This doesn\u2019t seem like the case for this child. I didn\u2019t pay attention to details and didn\u2019t apply myself like I could. Imagine hearing this every single day as a kid. Exhausting. School wasn\u2019t easy for me. I learned a lot during those years of struggling and i give all the credit to my parents who sat down and helped me. Met with teachers, made me do after school tutoring, sitting down and reading through tasks and instructions with me. All of this can be a learning lesson.", "YTA", "None of this happened", "YTA. Just because a child puts in a lot of effort, it doesn\u2019t always equal a top grade. If she missed the point of the assignment, she doesn\u2019t deserve the grade. The daughter\u2019s reporting of what the teacher said isn\u2019t reliable.", "You should have ask the teacher for a rubric maybe your daughter left out important parts. While the story maybe good she\u2019s right most children\u2019s books have pictures. As a teacher I always provide a written rubric for my students to make sure they include everything. I will tell you that by name calling to the teacher you have probably mess up any chance of her having a good relationship with you and your child. You need to apologize to her and yes the teacher shouldn\u2019t have called you a name back she needs to apologize as well.", "YTA\n\nAs a parent of 2 and partner to a teacher, there is 0 chance the teacher gave out this project and didn't give clear instructions on what was required. Your daughter not following the instructions is not a reason for you insulting the teacher.", "We need INFO\n\nWe need to know the precise language of the assignment in order to know if the kid followed the directions enough.\n\nI would say that the teacher either way went too far, but we also don't know what the teacher actually said.\n\nI just don't think there's enough information here to judge. And we have a lot of history of parents unfairly maligning teachers and unfairly believing their children over the teachers.\n\n---------------\n\nBecause what it sounds like is that part of the assignment was for the students to make their own cover art as well as the story. And your child didn't do that. Further, I recall a similar assignment I had when I was around that age, and the assignment included even binding the book. So using a notebook would have been against that as well.\n\nYour reluctance to specify the actual assignment leads me to believe you're leaving out details on purpose.", "And this, my friends, is why we have rubrics. No ambiguity.", "YTA - your child\u2019s story was probably wonderful and it would have really hurt getting that feedback from the teacher. It sounds like your child didn\u2019t follow the instructions and was graded accordingly. This is such a great opportunity to teach your child the value of following directions. \n\nYou verbally abused a teacher. Swearing at anyone is out of line, but especially in a school environment. You were allowed to validate your kids experience, get clarity on why it happened, and use this to help her improve there performance.", "So much missing information here, it\u2019s good to be proud of your kid but just taking their word blindly and going on the attack isn\u2019t ever a good solution.\n\nSounds like there were details of this assignment that your child missed.\n\nYTA", "YTA. I agree that it does seem like the critique from the teacher was hard and maybe not as constructive as it could or should have been, but going down there and yell and calling the teacher names is not okay. \n\nAlso if the assignment was to make a book, it implies that there is a need to make a front and back cover on top of the story, filling out a notebook would be failing to do the assignment. And if the teacher knows that your daughter loves to write then her only doing what she liked with the assignment does seem lazy.\n\nInstead of blaming the teacher for your daughter not writing then this is maybe a good time  to talk to her about have to handle crique, and that not everyone will always like what we make and \n\n\nIf you are truly worried about your daughter losing her passion for writing, then this is maybe the time to have a talk with her about critismen, how even though it sucks it is a part of life especially if this is going to be her career but that it is important for her to know that it isn't about her but people (even the teacher) wanting to help her do her best.", "Fake", "YTA. \n\nYour daughter didn\u2019t follow the assignment directions. Are you sure she wrote an original story? I wonder if she rewrote or copied parts of a Goosebumps story instead. Did you ask to see the rubric or directions? Did you ask for the teacher\u2019s side of the incident? You know it\u2019s respectful to hear the ADULT\u2019s perspective before demanding an apology and compliment. \n\nFYI-kids don\u2019t always tell the truth when they get grades they don\u2019t like or when they get caught doing something they shouldn\u2019t.", "You\u2019re not an A, but you overreacted.  I\u2019m both a veteran teacher and a parent of a 14 year old, and one thing I\u2019ve learned is to take everything a kid says about school or home interactions with a grain of salt.  Comments often get simplified, blown up, or exaggerated, and there\u2019s usually more nuances to a situation.  You went in there guns blazing all worked up assuming you knew everything about the situation.  The teacher was instantly put into a defensive situation and felt too closed down to have an honest conversation with you.  Next time seek to understand first and you\u2019ll get a lot more information before you fly off the handle.", "Maybe a little bit TA(? I don't know exactly how American schools work and if this could be an option, but I would totally go the Principal's Office or whoever could help you within the school administration.\n\nWhen grading an assignment, teachers need to provide what is expected from that assignment and the evaluation criteria, so students/parents can fight off their grade when something like this happens. Otherwise, this is the teacher's fault and you could go to whoever is above her to fix this. Maybe you could also talk to other parents to check how the teacher graded their kid's story. However, you can't just go a demand for a teacher to compliment your daughter's work, if anything you could've just ask the teacher to walk you through how she evaluated her work and how the feedback was given. Not saying that your kid is a liar but sometimes when something unpleasant happens to us, we remember the situation in a worser light. \n\nI agree that you shouldn't have called her that, as it directed the conversation to name-calling, but I think you could still fix this up for your daughter.", "Where's the rubric? When grading assignments, there is always a rubric to go off of to ensure you did the assignments correctly. If your kid didn't follow the requirements, it doesn't matter how good the story is. They still fail. Sorry they hurt her feelings, but school requires you to follow the rules and criteria. Even in grad school, there was a rubric we had to follow for our papers and projects. Your kid is probably lying, and I highly doubt a teacher told a 6th grader their book was the worst in the class. Yta for calling the teacher names and hounding.", "ESH. Even if your daughter didn\u2019t follow instructions and missed important elements that resulted in a lower grade, there is never any reason for a teacher to call something \u201cterrible\u201d in front of students. \n\nBut instead of you meeting with the teacher and simply asking, \u201cHey, what happened here, can you help us understand what went wrong?\u201c you just demanded a compliment instead. Maybe your daughter didn\u2019t actually deserve a compliment and it would\u2019ve made sense to want to understand WHY instead of just insisting it was perfect.\n\nThen you could\u2019ve explained to your daughter that while her teacher was wrong for being outright rude, your daughter was also wrong for doing the assignment incorrectly/insufficiently.", "A lot of school assignments are about following instructions and confirming to expectations, not about actually learning the subject. This is something I don't agree with but you have to learn to live with it. I encounter this in the adult world as well. Sometimes you just have to go with the flow at school or work, then find other ways to express your talents and creativity.", "Yes you are, an A all the way round the world and twice. Your daughter's homework wasn't right in the view of the person who set it. Life's like that. Teach your daughter to take feedback instead of showing her that dad will just start screaming insults at women whenever things don't go her way. Shit parenting.", "It\u2019s hard to tell since your side of the situation is so clearly biased. I bet the teacher\u2019s POV is completely different than the way you\u2019ve framed it.", "ESH\n\nThe teacher shouldn't have called a student lazy. That was uncalled for.\n\nHowever, you shouldn't have called the teacher a bitch. That was also uncalled for.\n\nAt the end of the day if your kid didn't follow directions then she isn't going to get a good grade. She didnt make a cover or add pictures which the teacher said were both required. It's not fair to the other students who did the required work to get a good grade and the kid who didn't do that to get the same grade as them.\n\nWe also don't know if the writing fit the prompt. Was there something specific they were to write about? When I was in 6th grade we had to write our own theme stories similar to something like The Boy Who Cried Wolf so we could start off with something simple about learning how to incorporate a lesson or a theme. We couldnt just write anything. The story had to fit certain requirements. \n\nYes your daughter might be an amazing writer and it's great that she enjoys it. However, that doesn't mean she can disregard the directions and then expect a good grade.\n\nYou could always frame your child's story or something or put it on the bookshelf to make your child happy and show that your proud of her writing and to keep encouraging her.", "I'm a writer. Please let your daughter know from me that \"found\" elements like building a story around a picture on the cover of a notebook are essential elements of creativity that *all* writers use. (Not necessarily pictures for all writers, but writers pick up any pieces of story they find lying around). Also, let her know that as far as creativity goes, teachers don't know shit (and the lower the grade, the less they know, if she gets lucky in high school she might have a teacher who knows a little bit, but honestly probably not).\n\nYou're not an asshole for confronting the teacher... but escalating to name calling does put you in solid YTA territory, unfortunately. It's also a really bad idea for pragmatic reasons. The teacher now has your daughter flagged in her mind as a \"troublesome\" child because of your behavior and her experience at school will be the worse for it. It sucks. But when you have to give someone power over your child for several hours every day, it's really not smart to needlessly antagonize them.\n\nI'd strongly advise you to write an apology to the teacher. You can say something like \"While I still strongly oppose the remarks that you gave my child, as I feel creativity should be nurtured at all ages, I wanted to reach out an apologize for my choice of language during our conversation. That was completely out of line and I'm pretty embarrassed about the words that came out of my mouth.\"", "YTA, on what planet is it okay to verbally assault your child's teacher? \n\nParents like you are the reason everyone I know who was a teacher is no longer a teacher. You literally took this situation from discussing your daughter's assignment and as soon as you called the teacher a bitch you should have been escorted from the school grounds. \n\nTeachers aren't paid NEARLY enough to deal with half of the BS they do.", "YTS.\n\nYou're dealing with a child so \n\n>Apparently the teacher chewed her out when she saw her story. She basically told her that her story is the worst one in their class.\n\nyou should have known this was an interpretation by a child.\n\n>She said she will not be doing that as my daughter did an awful job. According to her my daughter should have created a cover instead of using a notebook and called her lazy for not putting any effort in it and also according to her a children's book needs pictures and my daughter didn't do that. She told me that my daughter got a D in this assignment and she won't get an apology for being \"lazy\".\n\nSo your daughter didn't so what she was supposed to and did a lazy job on what she did do.

Asking the teacher to apologize and compliment her book doesn't set the right example for your daughter. Not everything a child does needs to be complimented, especially if it doesn't meet the guidelines of the assignment.

I can't imagine a teacher wanting to go through a bunch of bigger longer read books so def think it leans to she was expecting smaller, \"toddler style\" books and not a detailed one like a goosebumps style. In which case, yea your daughter should be graded on it. Listening to dirrections is usually part of a grade ya know...  \n\n\nBut how the teacher supposedly handled it really was uncalled for. If she did say the things she did, she is an AH and should have kept it neutral. She should have simply left it at your daughters didn't meet the given criteria, showed you the criteria, and maybe even talk about where the misunderstandings were.

If she was saying nasty things like you say, you should have immediately disengaged and gotten the higher-up people involved.  \n\n\nBut you didn't help your child either.

You shouldn't resort to name calling. \n\nI'm guessing what your daughter interrupted as a children's book wasn't exactly the assignment. To me a children's book, is  a picture book for 5 and under (hence the teacher wanting a cover and pictures). Goosebumps is more middle grade reading, so I think your daughter did technically do it wrong, but the teacher should have guided her better and explained the difference between book levels. I wouldn't call writing a middle grade level story lazy, but the teacher's handling of the assignment definitely sounds lazy in communication and expectations.", "ESH. I think it is great that you are a supportive parent but you made a mistake by jumping to an angry confrontation and escalating the situation instead of trying to gain a better understanding of what happened and where things went wrong. The teacher also escalated the situation by responding in anger and calling your daughter lazy instead of explaining her point-of-view and reasoning for giving such a low mark or offering an opportunity for a make-up assignment.\n\nThis might be an opportunity for you to teach your daughter to ask more questions about assignments and --more importantly-- not to let other people's criticism break her spirit or discourage her from what she wants to do.

In this case, if she did not specifically include in the instructions/grading rubric that the assignment had to include artwork, then it is unfair to grade students on her assumptions instead of her instructions. For all she knows, a student could have just been reading the original Grimm Brothers and tried to imitate them (their stories were not illustrated when first published) and so there would be no illustrations to be found. She also needs to explain to students what is expected of them to get a better mark rather than treating them as lazy since she doesn't know what circumstances a child might be facing and assuming the worse never helps.

You correct the student not degrade them. Report this teacher immediately.", "Nta.  Even if your kid didn't understand the assignment (by this I mean she apparently was supposed to illustrate her story as well as write it) the teacher should not have insulted her the way she did. She could absolutely give her a lower grade for not doing the assignment correctly, but to tell her the book was the worst in the class and call her lazy is absolutely uncalled for and extremely destructive to a creative kid's confidence. She should have praised what she did well and calmly explained that her grade in the project has to be lower because part of the assignment was illustrating it as well. But you absolutely can't tear a kid down the way she did, this could effect their confidence for years to come.  If I were you, I'd be going to the school administration and demand an explanation as to why they think it's appropriate for their teachers to insult their student's work.", "Nta. Teachers are almost always lazy, despotic and dim.", "NTA. You stood up for your daughter. She clearly put in work, even if she misunderstood the assignment she is no way \u201clazy\u201d.

But one thing that could potentially change that is first of all, did the teacher specify that they had to design the front cover themselves? If not, then she is an asshole, because she shouldn't be failing your 11/12 year old daughter for something she didn't specify she had to do. But if she did specify that and your daughter didn't do it, or forgot to do it, or didn't understand that she was supposed to design the front cover herself, then unfortunately she's justified. But that doesn't necessarily make you an asshole if it is true. If it was specified that she needed to do that, did you *know* it had been?

When I confronted my teacher he told me I was lucky to get a D, I hadn't followed the instructions and as such my paper didn't meet the assignments criteria. I can still remember to this day him telling me that it's irrelevant if the paper was well written because the when you cut corners, don't bother to understand the instructions correctly and choose an interpretation that aligns with your own interests,  you are actually being lazy and deserve to fail. I can tell you that really hurt. I worked hard and was told I was lazy and essentially self-indulgent. However, he was right. He wasn't pleasant but he was right and he taught me one of the most valuable lessons I learned at school. If you don't produce what is requested of you, regardless of how good what you have done is, you automatically fail.\n\nI think your daughter deserved her grade. She's old enough to be told she didn't adhere to the assignment and as such since everyone gets marked against the same criteria and her work couldn't meet the criteria because it wasn't what was requested she earned her bad grade. I don't agree with how the teacher spoke to your daughter (if indeed your daughters version is accurate - my own at that age would exaggerate everything) nor do I agree with how you seem determined not to recognise that you and your daughter misinterpreted an assignment (in a way that was favourable to your daughter since it meant she got to indulge in her own hobby) that apparently the rest of the class easily understood. \n\nTalk to your daughter and explain that after speaking to the teacher you realise that she got the grade (despite the fact that you think her work was good) because she didn't follow the instructions. She was tasked with a children's book and instead wrote a preteen novel - very different style of writing. You can tell her that you misunderstood the instructions as well, so she's not alone in the mistake, but that unfortunately when what you produce isn't what you are asked to produce you cannot get a good grade.\n\nPersonally, I think the teacher thinks (and I sort of agree with her) that your daughter's misunderstanding was deliberate so that she could indulge her hobby. Teacher should have conveyed that better. They were wrong in not providing a concise response based on the work to why she received her grade. However, having been in your daughter's shoes I know that it hurts a lot regardless of how it's convey, but it's an important hurt, you need to learn this lesson in life and it's better to learn now than in the work force.\n\nFollow the instructions.

If something is unclear to them we always tell them to ask the teacher for a further explanation. While the teacher sounds terrible for calling your child lazy, clearly your child made a book, even though she didn\u2019t follow the actual assignment, storming into her office and calling her a bitch isn\u2019t helpful.

Surely a task like this is to explore creativity, interpret a brief in your way, play to your strengths.

Obviously creativeness is probably the number one element in the evaluation. Hopefully this will help her see the truth in her writings.

A few weeks ago one of her teachers asked them to create a children's book. \n\nMy daughter has a very good imagination, she wants to be a writer when she grows up and she is pretty good at it. Her favorite books are the goosebumps series. \n\nSo when her teacher gave them this assignment, she decided to write a book similar to the goosebumps. I'm not gonna say it was perfect because she is just a kid but it was a decent book and I was proud of her when I read it. She also found a notebook with the picture of a girl on it and decided to write the story on that notebook and chose the girl to be the main character in the story. \n\nWell a week ago she came home, crying her eyes out. Apparently the teacher chewed her out when she saw her story. She basically told her that her story is the worst one in their class. \n\nI comforted my daughter however it has been a week and she hasn't been writing anything. She used to write a lot of stories but she has lost interest. \n\nI was really angry so I decided to meet the teacher and I told her she owes my daughter an apology and needs to compliment her book. \n\nShe said she will not be doing that as my daughter did an awful job. According to her my daughter should have created a cover instead of using a notebook and called her lazy for not putting any effort in it and also according to her a children's book needs pictures and my daughter didn't do that. She told me that my daughter got a D in this assignment and she won't get an apology for being \"lazy\". \n\nMy daughter spent 2 weeks working on that story and it's details. She is in no way lazy. \n\nI called the teacher a bitch and told her she has no right to talk about my child that way or treat her like that. She called me an asshole and asked me to leave\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When you said the teacher chewed her out, do you mean that she went beyond what would be a normal critique of an assignment to the point that she was berating and belittling the child?  If there was no rubric, you had some grounds to call for a meeting and involve her supervisor or principal.  Going to name-calling, however, has taken it out beyond that a bit and possibly will make it harder to have an honest conversation with a possible resolution reached.  \n\nYou need to know the exact criteria, in writing, from the teacher.  It has to be available and otherwise given to all the students as well.  She can't give a vague assignment and then come back and deduct points for \"missing\" parts if they were not originally outlined in the assignment criteria.  IF you find that there is a rubric (check timestamps and take screenshots) and your child did not follow the guidelines, apologize for the name-calling.  However, you can still critique her professionalism if she did go at your child outside of what is normal grading and critiquing of her assignment.  No name calling though.\n\nIf the rubric does not mention a proper cover, and pictures throughout, then with those screenshots or actual printout, you request a meeting with her and her boss to \"calmly\" go over what happened (your child needs to be there to tell her side of things about what the teacher said).  Do not interrupt, take notes (particularly if something is misrepresented or an outright lie), and when you or your child is speaking do not allow interruption as you \"respected\" their time and did not interrupt.  There is time to clap back or argue after each side speaks.  \n\nSadly most schools will take their employees' side, however, you can make them have to document the incident by having this meeting and keeping documentation of it yourself in case of future problems with the same teacher or any other potential retaliation against your child.  It does not hurt to reach out to others in the class to see how their children were treated during the assignment and compare books and grades.  Do this before any meeting as it might be useful if you come across students whose assignments were graded better but did not have a proper cover or pictures throughout much like your daughter.", "Did your daughter get a rubric for her assignment?

Interestingly enough, friends of my daughter let her know that the next year that same paper was used as an example of how that very same assignment was to be done.

However, demanding she compliment your daughter's book is also a step too far. You as a parent are going to deal with people hurting your daughter's feelings from time to time, and sometimes they aren't going to like something your daughter does. Bulldozing other people into lying to your daughter to make her feel better isn't going to do her many favors as she grows up.

Help them brainstorm what might have gone wrong (this does not include guessing that the teacher is an asshole). Did they follow all of the directions? Did they fully understand the class materials that the assignment was based on? Did they double check-check spelling and other language conventions? Is the work neat?

Focus on what is in your child\u2019s control. \n\nIf your child misunderstood the assignment, or doesn\u2019t know where they went wrong, then set up a meeting with your child and the teacher. Let your child ask why they got the grade and how they can do better next time. If the requirements for the assignment were demonstrably unclear, your child could ask for the opportunity to re-do the assignment, now that they have clarity. This will teach your child how to advocate for themself. \n\nIf your child reports that a teacher has spoken to them disrespectfully, I suggest doing some detective work.

In this situation if you have to have a winner and a loser then everyone loses. As a parent I am sure that you want your child to be confident and emotional stable. Help her to develop some skills for when she has to deal with challenging personalities and failures.\n Can teachers be overwhelmed and become insensitive to the needs of students? Sure. We all understand the types of issues teachers are coping with daily. Perhaps, without a lot of support but they are still responsible for teaching and providing an emotionally safe environment. \nThink about how different your interation might have been if you approached the teacher with the idea that the two of you have a shared problem and that you would like to work on it together.

Joining in a common goal of communicating with a positive supportive plan may get you better results. \nBut don't forget about your responsible of building your daughter's ability to see herself as a competent person.

Well, this student went crying to daddy because he didn't want a zero. The dad demanded a conference with my friend and the kid. So, my friend had irrefutable proof the student has plagiarized and showed it to the dad with the student sitting there.

Modern teaching emphasizes Differentiation- that different students are going to approach learning in different ways.  A good teacher should have graded the story on its own merits, *because* it was a writing piece and teachers need to encourage that.  I'd be *ecstatic* if a 6th grader I taught wanted to, essentially write a short story instead of drawing a cover piece.

Sure, not all kids get everything right, interpret a situation with an adult wrong, maybe even focus on the wrong part of the assignment.

Don't even get me started on high school.\n \nWere we kids angels? Fuck no. But we also weren't the adults in the situation. Teachers don't get a pass just because they are teachers. Just like cops don't (in a just world) get a pass because they wear a badge.

Let's not forget that shitty people tend to not admit fault, and if a parent is asking why their kid was left behind in some fashion, and said teacher starts deflecting, hell yeah a good parent is gonna fight back.\n\nOP should probably have avoided calling teacher a bitch, but sometimes you call a horse a horse.\n\nNTA", "Lol, I never said anything about children being perfect.

The daughter WAS lazy by just grabbing a notebook with a picture on the front instead of creating her own. She could have used it for inspiration, but didn't. OP also said it was a notebook, which implies lined pages. If there are supposed to be drawings accompanying the story, lined pages aren't exactly conducive for that.

On what planet does OP get to DEMAND a person compliment his child's work??? It doesn't matter how much time the daughter put in.

I told him I believed he could achieve the next level next time if he connected his ideas, drew new conclusions and used more evidence. \n\nHe had clear expectations and he did not meet them. I told him point blank he fell short of the assignment requirements and thus would not achieve the grade I believe he expected. Then I took the time to give him explicit feedback on how he could achieve at the next level if he chose. I\u2019m sorry but he\u2019s going to get constructive criticism in his life. Learning how to hear these things and move forward is important.\n\nWhat is the alternative? Give everyone a gold star for effort? Not hold kids accountable to high standards?

Other kids acted out and yelled during class etc but didn\u2019t get reprimanded nearly as much for that. She just zeroed in on me for some reason.

I had to make a children\u2019s book in school when I was about the same age. I clearly remember we had to illustrate each page and make a cover page with the title and our name as the author.

If Daughter completed the assignment correctly but was given an unfair grade, OP would need to calmly (!!!) arrange a meeting to talk about the grade. No hissy fits, no name calling.

Still, when you use the phrase \"Judging a book by its cover\" you're implying that the teacher glanced at the book and made a snap judgment, not a reasoned grading.  My point is if she did a bad job or did something else, now is the time to teach the daughter that assignment directives matter.  If an assignment was a watercolor, and she turned in a crayon drawing or an oil painting, the grade would still be failing.  If the assignment's story required including a family dealing with the death of a pet and she wrote about an alien invasion, that's not the assignment.  \n\nNo one said he couldn't ask the teacher about the grade.

The student who forgot to put his name on it did not get 50 points deducted.", "SAME in terms of assignment in elementary school. I also remember using construction paper so it was easy to have the space for pictures at the top and then write the text underneath. OP says daughter used a notebook. Which implies lined pages. Certainly not conducive for drawing pictures. Sounds like the daughter even used the wrong medium/materials for the assignment.

I think it inhibits creativity, prioritises box ticking and effectively penalises those which skills in one are as opposed to people with mediocrity in both.

What they should have done the moment the mom come in and had a fit is break out the rubric and point to exactly what her daughter is missing.  Then, because she's a 6th grader, she should have given the daughter the chance to fix the assignment for AT LEAST partial credit.  That's how people learn.  The teacher absolutely should not have said her daughter's story was the worst in the class (if that was even said).

It's not that hard to find a few good things, even if the whole thing sucked overall.    So yes, this teacher sucks.  But to completely dismiss the use of drawing and pictures from literacy education is extremely ignorant.   Look at any early writing curriculum and it's pretty much all got drawing in it.  It is also very, very normal to include art in ELA in middle school especially.  Kids need multiple ways of understanding.  No one teaches with just lectures anymore because for the VAST majority of kids, that's just not the best way to learn.   Teachers are trying to grab the attention of kids who are spoon fed entertainment to them 24 hours a day that is all flashing lights and instant gratification.  We are competing with extremely short attention spans that teachers just didn't have to deal with 70 years ago when you could tell kids to sit down shut up and write 10 pages or you'd beat them with a paddle (obviously I'm not nostalgic for the good ol' days of beating kids, just pointing out things are a little different).", "Are you really that obtuse?
