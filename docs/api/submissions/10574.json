These comments are wild to me honestly. I can\u2019t believe that people are saying you can\u2019t throw a second baby shower. People have large age gaps between children so they won\u2019t have any baby supplies left, you may have one gender and then the other (not everyone buys unisex things), you could have been a young mom and or in a bad financial state for your first child and not have received much, it may be flipped to where you had good finances with first baby but now things are different. Babies are destructive, sometimes your things get ruined especially if you thrifted a bunch of your stuff and it was not in good condition to begin with.

Some women think they\u2019re one and done and get rid of everything. \n\nI\u2019m a mom to a six year old and a 14 year old, I\u2019ve seen many women have two baby showers. I only ever had one, but that\u2019s because my 14 year old was not a baby, and adopted after I had my six year old, and due to emergency placement I had to immediately go out and buy her an entire wardrobe and supplies, and everything she needed right then and there. And I\u2019ve seen women also ask for only diapers and wipes plenty of times. Almost everyone who has a baby shower makes a registry! So you buy the things they NEED! And there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with throwing your own shower, I did. Some people don\u2019t have close enough friends and family to where somebody would think to throw them a shower. Some people have friends/relatives that like to make things about themselves and don\u2019t want those people calling the shots.

I don\u2019t care if it is a beige onesie with your least favorite saying/font. Those are called gifts and you say \u201cthank you\u201d for them. You can dispose of them as you like, in private, but you do **not** make a stink about receiving a gift. That includes not making snide remarks about it to other people. Those things have a way of eventually getting repeated, and not usually in a way that will make you look good.", "Wow NTA at all and I don\u2019t understand these people who think YTA. You are literally hosting (and presumably paying for yourself) a party to celebrate your second child where you\u2019ve specifically asked for diapers instead of any gifts. Diapers are like the bare minimum friends and family could help you out on. Honestly this sounds like a sprinkle to me, and you\u2019re not even expecting someone else to organize, pay for, or host it for you. The reason people have sprinkles is to get those few things you might need for a second baby that you don\u2019t already have. Like diapers.", "NTA. You know you need diapers. I don\u2019t see the harm in asking. If ppl don\u2019t like it they can just not bring a gift. And where I\u2019m from ppl have a baby shower for each baby.

Great as well.", "Wow, people have some VERY strong opinions and seem to think their way is the only way. It\u2019s OK for people to have different customs and expectations in different social groups. In this case, it seems like the problem isn\u2019t the second baby shower but people thinking diapers are boring (which they kind of are). For a lot of people, buying \u201ccute\u201d baby stuff is more for them than it is the mom. \n\nIt sounds like what OP wants is a celebration of the upcoming baby that isn\u2019t about getting gifts, which is fine. People are just getting hung up on the word shower. Maybe OP should have framed it differently, but what she wants doesn\u2019t make her an AH. Nor are her friends and family AHs for wanting to get something more exciting than diapers. \n\nHow about a diaper raffle? Say something like we have what we need for the baby and don\u2019t want gifts, but if you want to bring some diapers, you\u2019ll be entered into a raffle for some sort of prize. Requesting a children\u2019s book instead of a card is another popular thing in my area. People may still reach out saying they want to get something else. Just tell them that\u2019s nice of them but to give the gift some other time (maybe when they first meet the baby) so other people don\u2019t feel awkward at the party.\n\nOne more thing. I personally think putting on a celebration yourself is perfectly fine since it\u2019s a lot to expect someone else to plan and pay for a shower/party. In a typical shower, it\u2019s you making the registry and receiving the gifts no matter who is hosting it, so what\u2019s the difference to the guests really?

They also don\u2019t know that in this day and age if you don\u2019t have *some* hand in organizing your baby shower/sprinkle then the most likely scenario is one won\u2019t happen. Most people just don\u2019t volunteer to organize those for their friends/family anymore, and if a shower/sprinkle is something you want then there\u2019s nothing wrong with making it happen yourself. \n\nYou\u2019ll probably get more realistic replies about this issue by posting this question on one of the pregnancy or parenting subreddits.", "NTA in my culture, every baby gets a baby shower.

Only two people under 50 were there: an old friend who still lived in town, and one of the mom's-friend's teenage daughter who came for a lark.\n\nNone of my own friends had kids yet. I was the first one, by like three years. (A lot of them still never want any, and that's fine!) So it didn't occur to any of them to organize a party here in town, and I felt deeply awkward about asking a bunch of happily child-free geeks to drive an hour out of town to go to the hometown baby shower. (TBH I was a little terrified that they would dump me once I was the only mom in the crew--unfair of me, but that's hormones for you.) I work freelance from home, so I didn't have coworkers to do it, either.\n\nAnd I knew the \"don't throw your own shower\" rule, so I just sat on my thumbs for months, wishing they could read my mind, feeling horribly alone and convinced that the only people in the world who were genuinely excited for me were my mom's pals.
