Like this is such a weird concept to me. I\u2019ve been to several baby showers for a non-first baby and never cared who was throwing it. That doesn\u2019t make the parents less deserving of celebration imo.", "but i feel like if your argument is that \u201ccalling it a baby shower causes confusion because baby shower means they need many things and that it will be the same as the last\u201d , that confusion should be gone because of her clarification? she clarified her expectations very clearly on the invitation, so i feel like the semantics of what it\u2019s called should no longer matter", "Lol who gives a fuck what she calls it? If people don\u2019t like the whole \u201carrangement,\u201d they don\u2019t have to go.", "People can and do buy whatever gifts they want whenever they want.\n\nParents shouldn't pressure their friends and family into attending a party specifically to give them the things they need when they don't actually need anything, and knowing full well that they aren't going to appreciate the gifts being given to them. \n\nI said elsewhere that this may be regional, but it's super tacky where I am to do this for yourself. Just save the money and take care of your baby's needs. If you want a family get-together, have one without making it explicitly a gift giving event. OP's whole attitude and plan screams entitlement", "Yeah I\u2019m with you on this. Who cares what they call it? Either go and have a good time or just don\u2019t?", "Well obviously op has family members that feel entitled to her baby. They literally told her they want to spoil the baby. Not caring what op actually needs.", "Dude you are being aggressive. All I asked was a question. I didn\u2019t even call op an ah or anything.", ">\tParents shouldn\u2019t pressure their friends and family into attending a party specifically to give them the things they need when they don\u2019t actually need anything\n\nSo how do they not need diapers? Diaper kegs are a very common thing. People seem to be taking huge offense to OP calling this gathering a \u201cshower\u201d and not a diaper keg if that\u2019s all she wants, but I think the name is irrelevant. If people disagree with the whole principal, then they can just not go.", "no i understand that and i\u2019m not disputing that, im just confused on the argument that THEYRE confused by the name since OP clarified to them what she needed. i think entitled is a better word to describe their feelings than confused", "But getting the invitation makes them feel they have to go. Are they going to lie to OP and say they're busy or tell her that they disagree? They're immediately put in a bad spot. \n\nJust because she needs diapers doesn't mean it's anyone else's responsibility to buy them for her. Normal people who aren't ungrateful and entitled just buy their own stuff. It's not that difficult a concept."]}
