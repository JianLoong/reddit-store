These comments are wild to me honestly. I can\u2019t believe that people are saying you can\u2019t throw a second baby shower. People have large age gaps between children so they won\u2019t have any baby supplies left, you may have one gender and then the other (not everyone buys unisex things), you could have been a young mom and or in a bad financial state for your first child and not have received much, it may be flipped to where you had good finances with first baby but now things are different. Babies are destructive, sometimes your things get ruined especially if you thrifted a bunch of your stuff and it was not in good condition to begin with.

Some women think they\u2019re one and done and get rid of everything. \n\nI\u2019m a mom to a six year old and a 14 year old, I\u2019ve seen many women have two baby showers. I only ever had one, but that\u2019s because my 14 year old was not a baby, and adopted after I had my six year old, and due to emergency placement I had to immediately go out and buy her an entire wardrobe and supplies, and everything she needed right then and there. And I\u2019ve seen women also ask for only diapers and wipes plenty of times. Almost everyone who has a baby shower makes a registry! So you buy the things they NEED! And there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with throwing your own shower, I did. Some people don\u2019t have close enough friends and family to where somebody would think to throw them a shower. Some people have friends/relatives that like to make things about themselves and don\u2019t want those people calling the shots.

I had a shower for my second because when we had our first it was at the height of COVID and we were stuck in a different country. No one met our son until he  was almost two. This let us have the fun of a party without the stress of putting it on someone else. \n\nEven for first time moms, there\u2019s no always willing family or friends who jump in and offer to throw showers.

And if you\u2019re that set in stone on the subject, it\u2019s a great time to stop asking people to celebrate your achievements and birthdays. \n\nHaving said that, while I am child free myself, I would much rather go to a celebration where I\u2019m asked to bring something useful for the baby being celebrated. Honestly, I like the sprinkle idea more than the shower. The latter generally comes with expectations and a wish list that includes the ideal for what they\u2019d like the kid to have.
