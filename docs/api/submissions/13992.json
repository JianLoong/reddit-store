Her reading your email and particularly USING your email to send emails is a major security violation here--there's no auditability regarding who is actually sending those emails. Most places where I've worked since the late 1990s, using another employee's email was pretty much a way to get your butt fired. \n\nIf it's a shared computer, nobody's email should be loaded into the primary email application, and if you're using some form of webmail, the browser should be set up to auto sign your account out on close.", "NTA idk what kind of company you're at, but anywhere I've ever worked NOT locking your computer could get you in trouble.

Maybe raise that issue to management before you call it quits.", "NTA.\n\nPersinal space and general assholery aside, management letting others use your account is a big no-no.

Looking for work after quitting is often quite stressful and you may take a weaker offer after a few weeks.", "That\u2019s not really answering any of my questions, though. \u201cClaire is sleeping with somebody\u201d is an assumption about why she is getting away with it; I am wondering *why any of this behavior is happening in the first place*.

Honestly ur never TA for leaving a job where u think ur being treated unfairly, but it feels especially justified here.", "There you have it.", "I think that it's a power play - that due to whatever personality quirks she has the woman wants to dominate those around her.\n\nShe must get satisfaction from being so pushy to others, but what a weird thing for her to enjoy.  \n\n *Normal people, even with great job security, don\u2019t just randomly steal computers*!\n\nThe important word there is \"normal.\"  Have you ever read *Confessions of a Sociopath: A Life Spent Hiding in Plain Sight*?  I'm not saying that she is a sociopath, but the book is interesting in that it is a look into the mind of a seemingly normal person who isn't normal at all.\n\nIf you start thinking like a TV or movie scriptwriter, there could be even more strange reasons why this woman might want access to computers that is largely anonymous.  OP will likely have a happier, calmer life without this particular job.", "I thought that it wouldn\u2019t matter though as I do 50-60 hours where she does 40 and below.\nI thought my work ethic would speak for itself", "it never does.
