I get body dismorphia, I'm 11 mo postpartum myself, but to the point where not even her husband can see her naked? That's an untenable approach that needs to be resolved, although that's between the brother and SIL, and not OP. One wonders if the husband has made comments that prompted this response, or if it simply because of extreme insecurities on the wife's end.\n\nHonestly, if I was in the same area as my hungry 4 month old and let them scream for 20-30 min, I'd feel pretty bad. Unless there were time constraints that didn't permit flexibility for getting ready. I get the feeling of being interrupted while you're doing self care (and yes, I count getting ready uninterrupted after having a baby as self care), but I'd also feel very selfish having put my wants before my baby's needs for that long a time. At the same time, having a husband who constantly needs mom to solve baby problems is exhausting. Buy we don't know enough about the dynamic to make any concrete assertions about their characters, so it's not fair to either claim that the mother is neglectful or the father is useless.\n\nAnd then none of the grownups in the house communicated properly with each other.

He\u2019s a new Dad, he\u2019ll get more experience and learn that sometimes they just don\u2019t calm down for a while. Mothers need as much time to shower, change, or eat as anybody else.
