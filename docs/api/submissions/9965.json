Normally my husband works all day, and our schedules conflict too much for us to be able to do anything, but this week he's going out of town, so his work schedule has shifted and he has today off. His best friend lives in a neighbouring city over an hour away, and he visits this friend close to every week.\n\nA few weeks ago he asked me what I wanted to do for Valentine's Day since he had it off. I asked to have a banana split with him at a fast food place. I was getting genuinely excited about it. This morning, he told me he had to cancel our Valentine's Day banana split because he forgot he'd made plans to go to his best friend's place for the day.\n\nOf course I was hurt, and frustrated and upset, but I don't want to be a bitch, so I don't say anything. He can make his own decisions. A few hours later he came back full of guilt and said he kind of wants to cancel his plans with his friend to spend V day with me. I told him it was too late. I told him I didn't want to go out for banana splits anymore, that he already broke what today was supposed to be. He practically begged me to still get banana splits with him, but I said no, I wasn't feeling up to it anymore.\n\nAm I the asshole for keeping our V day plans cancelled after he cancelled them to prioritize his friend?", "created_utc": 1676408035, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112fv5n/aita_for_keeping_my_husband_and_is_valentines_day/", "score": 2586, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And if you accidently do that, who the fuck tries to cancel with their spouse as a first course of action, especially when the special V-day plan you want is just an ice cream at a fast food joint? Sis your standards are on the GROUND and the dude you married still can't meet them. This is so sad.", "NTA\n\nIf he was so guilty, why did he go in the first place?", "NTA. Spouse trumps friends on Valentine\u2019s Day. Y\u2019all had plans. He made his choice, he can stew in that guilt and learn to prioritize from now on. It sounds like you guys have a hard time finding couple time, to begin with. This should have been a priority over other options. I don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t put their spouse first, but I do understand the divorce rate is high for numerous reasons\u2026", "NTA\n\nHe CLEARLY made his friend a priority when deciding to cancel the plans you guys had together. I would be PISSED. \n\nWhat the hell kind of guy thinks \u201clet me just cancel my valentines date with my SO to spend time with my friend\u201d. \n\nYes, he feels guilty, but why would he do it in the first place? OP, his priorities are not with you.", "NTA, he can't just dump you and go back to you when it's convenient. Sure it's \"just a banana split,\" but it's about respecting you as a person and as his wife. He made his priorities clear when he cancelled the first time.\n\nI can't help but wonder if he mentioned this to his friend and his friend tried to talk some sense into lol. But too little too late IMO", "NTA - He asked you weeks ago what you wanted to do. You two made a plan, and then he forgot about it? Or thought you wouldn't care? Or that he wouldn't feel guilty? Or that a little anger/disappointment from you was a price he was willing to pay to spend this time with his friend? \n\nIf he had just outright canceled his plans with his friend so he could go back to your original plan, I would have given him the benefit of the doubt. But he didn't do that. He tried to dump his guilty feelings on you and make you be the one to \"tell him\" to cancel his plans with his friend.  \n\nHe wants credit for feeling bad about what he did. He wants you to either tell him its not a problem so that he doesn't have to feel guilty or he wants you to make him choose you so that you will feel like you \"owe him\" for doing the favor of spending time with you. That is not how relationships work. He can either decide for himself to fix his mistake or make it up to you, or he can deal with his feelings of guilt.  \n\nIt is not your job to make him feel less guilty when he does something inconsiderate.  **You don't have to disregard your own feelings just because your hurt feelings make him feel bad.** It is not your job to tell him to make a certain choice so that he doesn't have to. He is responsible for his choices and actions and he is responsible for the impact they have on others.", "NTA. I\u2019m really surprised by all the Y T A judgements. You were hurt because your husband prioritized his friend over you. When he came back wanting to spend the day with you, you were still understandably hurt and did not feel up to going out with him. You shouldn\u2019t have to suck it up to make him feel better. You were hurt and needed space and didn\u2019t feel up to going out. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I don\u2019t get why so many people think you are intentionally trying to punish him. It doesn\u2019t sound that way at all to me. Your hurt is totally valid. He literally canceled on your VALENTINES DAY plans for his friend. You have every right to be hurt by that, and you don\u2019t need to pretend not to be to appease him.\n\nEdit: added a couple sentences to express my sentiment a bit better", "NTA what kind of jerk cancels Valentines day with his wife to go hang out at a friend's house? I don't blame you for being hurt and angry, I wouldn't go either. Who wants to waste an afternoon on a ruined date?", "NTA \n\nI would feel like 2nd place to the friend at this point and also be uninterested in putting the plans back in place.", "NTA...I bet his buddy had plans for Valentine's", "what kind of person in a relationship cancels their plans with their SO to hang out with a friend on valentine's day? your husband acted really inconsiderate, and you're under no obligation to want to reinstate your plans with him - go take yourself out for a banana split! :) NTA, and i hope you can have a good chat with him later about how it's not okay for him to treat you like a second priority.", "NTA he canceled the plans first. Of course at that point you won\u2019t want to do anything anymore your feeling are hurt. Not your fault he chose his friend over you at first before he changed his mind and wanted to do your plans", "NTA, he hurt you, you're allowed to be hurt and not want to go out. It's not petty its how you feel and you don't have to suck it up because he got bailed on", "NTA. His actions would have hurt my feelsngs terribly. Coming back later because he likely felt guilty would have been a too little too late for me too. I mean all you wanted was a freaking banana split with your husband.", "NTA.\n\nLike at this point it would feel like he was just trying to pacify you. And I know if I were in your shoes i would be feeling guilty for being upset after he went and changed his mind again FOR ME and it would be this vicious cycle of feeling bad and sad and angry. The entire night would just be sour.\n\nI get he might want to see his buddy on his day off, especially if he doesn\u2019t get to see his friend much either with his work schedule. But he\u2019s gonna cancel plans with his SO on Valentines? The damage is done.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m honestly shocked at the YTA\u2019s. This isn\u2019t OP holding a grudge, this is OP expressing their hurt on top of a fresh emotional wound. A grudge would be punishing him for it days/weeks/months later. This happened TODAY. They\u2019re allowed to be upset about it.", "Idc what others say but NTA. You want to go on with your day as is. He was the one that canceled. Could you reconsider? Sure. But it\u2019s valid the feeling was broken and him flip flopping would be really off putting to me too. Enjoy your banana split! Edit to add: he should feel guilty. He didn\u2019t even cancel the plans before trying to make you responsible for his decision. He sees his friend regularly and made your plans first. He probably just wanted something to bitch to said friend about if you did say he should cancel. Again: enjoy YOUR banana split", "NTA. You\u2019re within your right to keep the plans canceled as he didn\u2019t prioritize you, his wife, on Valentine\u2019s Day. If you can talk to him and let him know your feelings but in my humble opinion he should already know he messed up and why and should definitely make this up to you. I\u2019m sorry your vday didn\u2019t go as planned, I\u2019d go out and get myself that banana split anyways :)", "NTA. He needs to plan better.", "NTA. He hurt your feelings and that can\u2019t be fixed immediately. The fact that he told you he needed to cancel plans for his bestie at all is a huge no. I\u2019m glad he figured out his mistake but he can\u2019t expect you to stop feeling hurt.", "NTA. Did he even apologize for originally prioritizing his friend over you? If there was no sincere apology, I can understand why you wouldn't want to go now. It feels like it's become a second choice guilt date.", "NTA, even if you did go out tonight with him, you would have still been upset because you were the afterthought instead of him honouring his plans with you from the start he only did once he realised he has ruined the day for you as a couple.\n\nThe people saying you should have still gone haven\u2019t realised that you can\u2019t switch your bad mood/upset off like a light switch and continue the day like it was just a blip or never happened.", "NTA at all. He asked you what you were doing on V day, thus acknowledging it as a holiday, and then asked you to do something on that day. Then canceled it day of. Why would he expect you to be enthusiastic knowing you were an afterthought and he chose his best friend over you to cancel on?", "We sure that's his best friend he's visiting?  Who makes plans with their bestie instead of their partner on fucking valentine's day?", "NTA.\nIt's an innocent mistake to double book oneself. But when he realized it, he prioritized his friend rather than his spouse.\nHe can apologize for it all he wants. You can forgive if you want. But you do not need to resume those plans if you don't want to.", "NTA  \n\n\nyour husband is TA  \n\n\nSeriously, he could have told his friend he forgot his plans with him and had to prioritise his wife for VALENTINES DAY. Instead he ditches you and then gets second thoughts after a while Likely because his friend told him what he did was stupid and that you were likely mad.", "Nta why do I think the friend realized what daybed was and cancelled on him?\n\nHe hurt your feelings by prioritizing his friend, then tried to come back and undo his poor behavior.  It doesn't particularly matter if he's sorry. He still did it.\n\nOnce you've both had time, you should talk with him. Tell him exactly why you didn't want to go out anymore.  Accept his apology and move on.", "NTA.  In the past I've really looked forward to something with my husband, only for us to go do it and he's in a miserable mood.  Which in turn made me incredibly upset.  I was so disappointed so I got quiet and just cancelled the rest of the day by saying lets just go home.  He realized he ruined the day and tried to get us to go back out but at that point, I was too sad.  I knew he felt bad, but it didn't matter.  The excitement had already been crushed and I had no joy left to do anything else.  \n\nWhere I super don't think your an AH is I saw the comment that he only came back to you that he wants to cancel with his friend only after his friend told him he has plans both before and after his visit.  I dunno...to me that makes it worse.  He doesn't want to cancel because he realized he wants to spend it with you... it feels like he realized he's disrupting his friends plans now so he may as well try to 'make it up to you'.  Totally might be me looking to much into it, but that's how I read it.", "NTA. Let\u2019s set aside the fact that it\u2019s a holiday. You made plans with him that were important to you, he decided to do something else, and only changed his plans to be with you because his friend had plans? You do realize that he is choosing his friend over you, right? He doesn\u2019t seem very invested in your relationship, and I would have a conversation with him about respect and priorities.", "NTA I honestly don't get the other votes. He really could have done both. My partner asked for a corndog for v day. I had to work all day and get off at 11 pm. But I bought a whole box of corn dogs to share with her.", "NTA. He kind of spoiled the mood by canceling. No point going if your heart isn't into it anymore.", "NTA\n\nIf he was so guilty, why did he go in the first place?", "Did he feel bad and cancel the plans with his friend or did the friend cancel them?", "NTA. When he came back feeling guilty he said he kind of wanted to cancel on his friend - meaning he hadn't done so yet. Sounds like he felt guilty and wanted you to either get excited that he was willing to fix his mess or have you tell him he shouldn't have felt guilty about canceling on you last minute.", "His first choice was to spend Valentine\u2019s Day with his friend. After that fell through, you were second choice. Take yourself to dinner, get your own banana split & eat it in front of him.\n\nNTA", "NTA...The damage was done. His guilt isn't worth much after the fact.", "I get the feeling he only realized he f\u2019ed up cause his friend asked him why tf would he ditch his SO on Valentine\u2019s to see a friend he already sees weekly. NTA, honestly.", "NTA. I've been married almost 23 years, with her for 27. I learned a long time ago that if I planned something with someone else overtop a special day that I might as well go sleep on the couch. In youth you might not see it as how rude it actually is, but man you start growing up, even just a little bit, and you realize that this person who's supposed to be the most important person shouldn't be ditched on these few days without a good reason. Unfortunately, best friends on a just because visit is not a good reason. \n\nI wouldn't recommend making him suffer this for too long, he hopefully got the message.", "NTA- today is a couple's day even if he thinks it is a made up card/candy/flower industry conspiracy. Im sorry you were disappointed; his cluelessness is crud.", "NTA, he already decided.", "NTA. Even if it wasn\u2019t Valentine\u2019s Day, he cancelled on plans with you last minute to hangout with a friend and that\u2019s shitty to begin with.", "NTA. He just wants to make himself feel better cause HE feels guilty.. not because he wants to make it up to you...  Actions speak louder than words. Even if he did have other plans, he still can't take and HOUR to spent w you for icecream? F no. Then, to add insult to injury, the only reason he was free after ditching you was because the said friend he dumped you for had plans w his fianc\u00e9. Like he should. I'm sorry you were let down like that. I'd be upset too and would just wanna spend the day at home relaxing. Pitty dates aren't fun. Hope things look up!", "NTA. He made plans with you and then waited until the day of to cancel and choose to spend his time with someone else. That wasn't your fault. If he wanted to spend time with you then he would have.", "NTA \n\nI doubt plans were already made to go to his friends, but even IF plans were made with the friend it\u2019s V-Day, the guy has his priorities mixed up.", "Nta. How did he not know what day it was when he made those plans with his friends? If y'all celebrate Valentine's Day on the regular, you should have been his first and only thought that day. Even if you don't and he didn'tremember what day it was, the instant you mentioned Valentine's Day plans he should have canceled on his friends to spend time with his WIFE. I don't blame you for your reaction at all.", "NTA - i was leaning E S H until i read some of your comments. i\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to a marriage course; i hope it helps him prioritize his family (you) in the future and appreciate you. it makes my chest hurt; you wanted to do something so low-key, simple, and sweet for to him disappoint you on so many levels sucks.", "NTA \n\nMy husband tried to do something similar with me on super bowl Sunday and double booked himself with his friend who I actually despise for being a condescending prick to me in front of my husband. I\u2019m still hurt but he did turn around and come home before he actually got to his friends house.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA, you were well within your rights to express your hurt feelings. But, this isn't a situation where you want to be cleared on the AH allegations and move on. Think about the ramifications for the relationship as well. Definitely sit down with your husband and talk about it.", "NTA\n\nYour husband most likely got scolded by a friend or coworker, realized how badly he fucked up, and that is why he came back with his tail tucked between his legs\n\nEven the husbands out there who hate Valentines Day and are terrible gift givers...know that you don't skip Valentines Day unless your wife chooses to skip Valentines Day.\n\nAnd even then, you should still stop and grab some Candy for her\n\nI think you should give him the opportunity to make it up to you and see if he does anything or just blows it off.\n\nAlso\n\nDon't stay home tonight with him.  Go see family or friends.  Leave him to his own devices", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t want to go out and pretend my feelings aren\u2019t hurt.", "Yikes. NTA, if my SO did that to me I\u2019d be extremely upset, and even if they did profusely apologize I wouldn\u2019t really feel like it after. It would just feel like pity at that point. I can\u2019t believe someone would cancel plans or Valentine\u2019s Day, the day of love, to go hang out at a buddy\u2019s house for the day", "NTA", "NTA. Under no circumstances should he have even considered cancelling V day plans with his wife to go hang out with his friend, especially not when it's something they do weekly and thus can totally wait one goddamn week to celebrate one of the few major days where you're supposed to spend time with your partner. He shouldn't have even made plans to spend V day with the friend to begin with; his thought process should have been, \"major holiday for romance with your loved one, can't hang out that week' WELL in advance of this debacle.", "NTA", "NTA - but this seems odd.", "I will try not to assume too much here, but as a man who has very close guy friends that live about an hour away, I don't go to see them every week, and that was true even before I started dating my girlfriend. I find that rather odd.\n\nI don't know OP's marriage, and I don't want to plant an intrusive thought, but I find it a bit dubious that this man is doing what he claims, especially when he's leaving his wife on Valentine's Day to do it.", "NTA. Once he broke his promise, you weren't feeling it any more. What do the people who say YTA or ESHs think? That you should eat your feelings because he feels guilty and decides to go out with you after all? After screwing up your plans? NTA", "NTA - I do not blame you for not wanting to play 2nd fiddle to your husband and the error that he made.  Hopefully he understands what he did and will learn from it.  You are lucky he figured it out....still a crappy mistake on his behalf but he seems as though he is a quick learner.", "NTA. He asked you what you wanted to do, agreed to plans YOU BOTH MADE TOGETHER, then canceled day of, then gets upset with you for being upset at him for canceling on you...when he suddenly realized his friend might already also have plans for the day. \n\nI'm not saying people need to have elaborate plans, for instance, we're having a nice dinner at home, because that's what we as a couple decided to do. And my partner is buying the flowers because they asked if I wanted them and I do.", "NTA, he\u2019s TA. Wife comes before friends!", "You will probably be called an ahole but honestly I get it. \n\n\nYou husband cancled on you last minute. \n\n\nThen wants to cancle on his friend last minute. \n\n\nHis poor planning hurt your feelings and is pretty childish. \n\n\nNTA", "What kind of person chooses a friend they see every week over their partner on Valentine\u2019s Day and then suddenly feels guilty about it when they come home\u2026? \n\nEither your husband has the emotional intelligence of a 10 year old, or he\u2019s a cheater and he was actually seeing someone else, hence the guilt. Please demand better for yourself. You\u2019re not a bitch for wanting your husband to spend time with you on Valentine\u2019s Day. The fact that you let that slide to begin with baffles me. \n\nNTA and please do some self reflection and have some more self respect.", "NTA the comments calling you an asshole are bs, I wouldn't have been in the mood to celebrate either after being put off by my partner. He's not entitled to your time after blowing you off and whoever calls you petty for not just doing what he was because he's 'obviously feeling guilty' just doesn't get it.", "NTA- Who the hell makes plans to spend V-day with \"a friend\" when they have a wife? It sounds like he made plans to do/go/meet another woman and then either she canceled or he just had too much guilt to go through with it.", "NTA. It sounds like he only came back because his friend had plans anyway? So you're somehow both the person he canceled on and his backup Valentine's day date.", "NTA...he needs to find some priorities in regards to your relationship.", "Nta. How massively disrespectful to your relationship. He canceled V day plans with you to hang out with a friend. He can kick rocks, Id be pissed too and no longer in the mood.", "NTA at all. Who makes plans to hang out with their friend on Valentine\u2019s Day instead of their WIFE???", "NTA. Even after he realized he double booked he cancelled with you first instead of telling his friend he had to cancel. Why would you be the first he cancels with on Valentine\u2019s Day?", "NTA He fully killed the vibe by prioritizing his friend over you.", "No no no noooo. He messed up, he needs to sit in this guilt. Who the heck would cancel on their wife for valentines day to go see a friend. You were asking for a banana split, not something ridiculous. If he can't make the time to fulfill your simple request, he ain't worth it.", "NTA. Tell him you made plans and go out yourself.", "NTA\n\nYour bf fucked up big time and I wouldn\u2019t be in the mood to go out when my bf discarded me without a second thought for his friend on Valentine\u2019s day. He should be groveling right now", "Why the fuck is everyone saying YTA or ESH? Absolutely NTA. Any other day I would've accepted but he ditched plans on Valentine's day to hang out with his buddy. Of course you wouldn't want to do anything anymore after that.", "Info: is this something he does often or a first offense for making plans and having to cancel for friend ?", "NTA.  You are his wife.  Special occasions with you come before friends he sees weekly unless you've both expressed that its nbd.  Does he normally prioritize his friends before you or is this out of character for him?", "I wouldn\u2019t want to be his afterthought/guilt trip either.", "NTA - I came here to say, \"Did he really come back 'full of guilt' or did his friend cancel plans to spend time with his own SO?\"  and reading the comments, that is exactly what happened.  He didn't feel bad.  He didn't realize his mistake, and cancel plans with his friend.  He only decided to go out with you because he literally had nothing else to do...there is nothing wrong with not wanting to go out with him under those circumstances.", "NTA\nI totally get it. You're rightfully hurt and it makes sense since he kinda ruined it by initially putting his friend first. If I was in your shoes, I wouldn't want to get banana splits with him anymore either, because now the day is associated with being hurt by him.\nI'd say a good compromise is to make separate plans with him on a different day. That way you can mentally disassociate the time with your husband with the hurt you're feeling right now. Valentine's Day is special, but it's ultimately meant as a way to celebrate your relationship. Setting aside the time is what's really important, not necessarily the day it's celebrated on.", "NTA. He chose someone else over you on Valentine\u2019s day. He can deal with that choice. Also go get banana splits by yourself or with a close friend! Don\u2019t let him ruin the splits for you.", "NTA. He\u2019s the asshole for even considering having plans with a friend instead of his wife on Valentine\u2019s Day.", "NTA. Sounds like there is more going on then him just changing his mind. I bet his friend gave him a swift talking to and told him he was crazy. We don\u2019t do Valentine\u2019s Day either but if my husband and I made plans, I would tell him that he\u2019s out of his damn mind if he tried to cancel for a non emergency.", "I do not understand the comments that say anything other than NTA.  You are allowed to not want to go out anymore after your husband prioritized a friends he sees WEEKLY, over plans he made with you. And no you shouldn\u2019t have had to tell your husband that it upset you that he cancelled. That\u2019s common sense, he\u2019s not 5, he\u2019s a grown man that should have enough emotional intelligence to know you\u2019ll be hurt. I wouldn\u2019t want to go out anymore if I were in your position. I\u2019m sorry your husband doesn\u2019t care enough to choose you first.", "NTA- i get that he probably wasnt thinking about it being hurtful to you when he canceled your plans. He was probably just thinking that he made the other plan first. But when youre in a relationship you need to consider how the other person will feel before doing shit like this.", "Are you the wife of the guy from yesterday who said \u201cmy wife cancelled our plans, would I be an AH if I went and had dinner with my female friend without telling my wife\u201d\n\nWeird coincidence if not. \n\nAnd if not, not the AH of course, regardless. \n\nIf my s/o asks to watch one of my favorite movies with me and falls asleep but wakes up when I shut it off with \u201cwhyd you turn it off?\u201d\nBecause you showed me you didn\u2019t care about something that is important to me. So now I\u2019m not going to watch it with you. It\u2019s a ruined experience", "NTA I don't get the other votes, he asked her what she wanted to do for Valentine's Day then decided to go hang out with his friend instead. It would be different if he forgot about it altogether but he didn't. He canceled to be with his friend, she is allowed to be hurt by that and not want to go out after husband ditched her.", "NTA. I've read your post history and it reads very self-centered on his part. \nOnly PIV and no foreplay for you to get you there,  not keeping Valentine's plans because he'd rather see his friend and then cancelling because he feels 'guilty'... Sounds like the friend cancelled tbh....", "NTA. The whole weekly friend visit is strange. Do married people really see one specific friend weekly? Most I see my best friend is monthly if I'm lucky.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nYou said he already made plans. But then commented that he only canceled because he called his friend to ask what they had planned for valentines for them to do, and the friend said he had plans with the fianc\u00e9 before he comes over and after he leaves. But nothing for when they hang out. Only then did he feel guilty because even his friend is prioritizing his fianc\u00e9 while he\u2019s not even prioritizing his own wife. If the friend didn\u2019t mention what he was doing with his fianc\u00e9 and just mentioned what they would do would he have felt guilty and canceled? Y\u2019all expecting her to still be excited to go out and have a banana split are ridiculous. He ruined the mood. He can\u2019t expect her to be excited about it again. When he didn\u2019t didn\u2019t even feel guilty for canceling with her until the friend mentions the plan with his fianc\u00e9. I bet the friend asked if he had anything planned with OP and then felt embarrassed for not having an answer. He can make it up to OP by planning something else", "NTA. And I\u2019d be looking a tad closer at that \u201cbest friend\u201d situation, as there seems to be more loyalty and effort towards it than you.", "Nta he just trying to make himself feel better. Go get yourself a ice cream without him maybe see a movie \ud83d\ude02", "Nta and everyone who disagrees should not be in a relationship or just friendship in general", "Nta hes gotta learn somehow.", "NTA  \nHe made plans with you and then canceled.  You are allowed to feel how you feel about the situation.  I wouldn't have wanted to go after the fact.  I would not have enjoyed it.
