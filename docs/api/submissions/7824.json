The truth is you are not relying on anybody to make money, it is up to you only to make money.

She\u2019s asking you to make her a your number one priority over your work/business and mad that you won\u2019t. You\u2019re offer for dinner was very nice and a very reasonable alternate solution.

Leave her the phone number for deliveroo.", "NTA\n\nShe lacks maturity and is trying to train you to drop everything when she snaps her fingers. She's going to escalate the situation so you learn to equate telling her \"no\" with an illogical meltdown that would be easier to avoid had you just done what she told you to in the place.

Your gf is though", "You really have to ask us? You are her boyfriend, not her maidservant. Dude.....", "NTA. No offence but you are your girlfriend's prop. Be at her beck and call.

And that you're an adult too, with all the responsibilities that come along with that.\n\n\nShe's not entitled to your time whenever she wants it, you're not a possession.", "Yeah, this week has been insane. I'm not stressed negatively, but positivively. I've delivered some fantastic stuff this week and have kept my productivity high. My clients are super happy. Business is going great. I also feel it's quite inconsiderate. If she voiced the same feelings, I'd understand completely. It wouldn't even be a discussion point, it's just facts. If you don't have time, you don't have time, let's do something tonight or tomorrow instead, etc., etc... that feels like a more reasonable reaction than slamming the door in my face and being grumpy every time I say no to her.", "And don\u2019t forget selfish! NTA", "She have made comments about me not 'being there for her', but because it's based off these types of requests (i.e. 'drive me to work,' 'pickup me and my friend from the bar', 'drive me here', 'drive me there'), I feel that it's a bit ridiculous. I'm not her personal driver. \n\n1-3 days a week, she also works from home. So we spend most days together, and pretty much 6/7 evenings a week together. Usually all weekends together too. It's pretty rare for me to go off and do something else with my friends.\n\nBut she have said she wants me to do more stuff with me as well, go places etc. I get that and I'm down, but I feel like it must be okay to say no as well without being the bad guy. She says no to things I suggest and I don't think twice about it. You're not feeling it, you're tired, you can't, don't have time, etc. I completely get it. It's normal. But it should be a two-way street.", "Exactly! I treat my own business like I'm employed at my own company (which I technically am). Sure, I have more freedom, but this week, I simply can't afford to take 3 hours out of my day for lunch. I'm stressed and got tons of work to do for clients who are waiting. I feel like I should be able to say 'no, sorry' without causing a crapstorm and being the asshole. It happens pretty much every time I say no to one of her requests.", "That's probably very true. I feel like I shouldn't have to suffer because of that. If the roles were reversed, I would never expect her to drive me to work anytime I ask either. Especially if she voiced she's super busy and don't have time.\n\nBut let's say she had a career-changing meeting and overslept. Would I drive her anyways? Hell yeah. But I can't drop anything just for her comfort.", "Some people do. Hell, some people think working even an \u201coffice\u201d job isn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve got a friend that does blue collar work and the only thing he sees as work is physical labor. Already stopped having that argument with him", "Naw, that would have been the first thing she did as your ex-girlfriend.", "Haha, honestly yeah. It isn't the first time it happens either... door slamming isn't common luckily, but it's more gaslighting and silent treatment behaviour which makes you feel like a complete asshole even though all you did was saying no.\n\nI feel like I should be able to say 'no' in a healthy relationship. She can, why can't I?", "Not really an everyday thing. I tell her no when it has to do with driving her places most often because a) I'm a new driver that hate driving in the city and b) She asks me to drive her places more like her chaffeur than 'let's go here and do X together, and lastly c) She asks me in super poor times, like 'can you pick me up NOW from work' when it's rush hour traffic, or super late in the night to drive to random places in freezing cold weather and icy road conditions.\n\nDefinitely, the dog will be fine. But if I'm away for three hours, when I come back, I have to take him out shortly after I come home, which leaves less time for me to get work done when I'm busy. Not ideal today with my workload and week, but no problem if I have a calmer day/week.", "That's probably exactly what I'll do. Thank you.", "This is very toxic behavior and may be signs of anger issues as well.", "You spend the days in the same place, but with you both working during that time you're not really spending it together. Working in the same place isn't quality time. I think you guys need to have a talk about this at a time when you're both not emotional and are thinking clearly. There seems to be a disconnect or lack of communication somewhere. Do you have a standing date night or anything like that? In the evenings and on the weekends are you guys actually doing things together and connecting or are you both just in the same house doing your own thing until bedtime?", "Who are you her personal Uber", "Here she ends up being unsupportive. I still resent my ex not to go the xtra mile to catch what it meant for me to be self employed and the daily consequences of being fully responsible for my financial health. He was not throwing tantrum or bad faces... Facing a lot of ppl having a boss and realizing that they did not get that my freedom is heavy to carry, I end up saying no to a lot of action/events that my flexibility could have allowed. Why? Because at the end of the day... Most of them delegated to their boss the load of bringing value and directions + money stability, they accepted the downside of having an external structure, a bit like at school... But this is also a structure that forces you to show up even if tired or discouraged. \nAbout your gf recurrent behaviour, maybe you can share more... And maybe you need her to get used to your unavailability during regular hours : 9-5 type of day. 3 hours investment to have her keep smiling, that is a lot. 2 hours of work lost... Not even mentioning the fact that here now, you have deadlines. I practiced that for the past 2 years and the mindshift that it provoked in my surrounding is quite satisfying. I actually gained mental support and I get fully understood when I say I am not available even if weekends or evenings when it happens. If I acted like that with my ex it could have worked maybe. Just an idea.", ">Haha,\n\nNot a joke.\n\n>why can't I?\n\nBecause you're not in a healthy relationship.", "Yeah, I'm growing really sick of it. It feels like I shouldn't be treated like this by the person I love. Mutual respect should be a given.\n\nShe's probably also acting out on me because she dislikes her job, and because she's tired, but still. I would never do that unless the person did something seriously wrong. So that's how I treat her reaction: like I did something *very* wrong. But logically, I know I haven't. I just say no with clear reasons as to why. And, I proposed to make it up to her in another way because I felt bad saying no.\n\nIt messes with my mind.", "We have a date night every two weeks or so where we go out and eat. On weekends, we usually stay in and watch a movie. Otherwise, she watches TV and I'm at the computer. I think we both struggle with finding things we both get excited about doing. It's winter-time, so there isn't much to do where we live other than going to restaurants or the gym. And we both work so hard so we're usually pretty beat when weekends comes around.\n\nBut definitely, we can definitely do more stuff together and I'll try to talk to her about that.", "Completely agree with everything you say. Having your own business is a serious responsability. And during my years of entrepreneurship, I've learned exactly what you say: you need to set boundaries during your day to get sh\\*t done. Otherwise, you end up doing nothing, or start working evening and weekends to make up for lost work during the week. \n\nSo Monday til' Friday, 9-17, I'm working, exactly like I would have if I was employed. I take more breaks than an employee would, but I always think about solving problems, overcoming challenges, and innovating my company. But I love it, because it's something I've built, and I am my own boss. \n\nDefinitely will talk to her about that.", "That hit home. I have some stuff to think about...", "She\u2019s not treating you well. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about saying no. I can\u2019t fathom dating someone so rude and inconsiderate. Have you spoke to her about it yet?", "You do. I should also talk to her about it. Maybe she just wanted some time together. However I'd love it if my boyfriend offered me to make dinner (idc if it's takeout or if he cooks). NTA, she should know that a relationship is something that two people work on together and not one person always doing whatever the other person wants. \nIf she's not ready to have a conversation about that it might be time to think about spending your life with this person.", "Yeah, I have in the past. \n\nThen it came up that she thinks \"I'm not there for her\", and that \"she can't count on me \\[to drive her places anytime she asks\\]\". And yeah, that's right. You can't count on me to drive you places any time you want, because you know what, I have a life too. I wouldn't expect her to drive me places anytime she asks, either.\n\nI'm a new driver as well, and driving makes me a bit anxious still. I've voiced that to her too, and it wasn't really met with the understanding I hoped to get.\n\nShe definitely needs to get her own license, too.\n\nI'm definitely up for doing stuff, but every request she makes it either super inconvineant (i.e. can you drive me NOW right on this second, with no heads up, even though I know you're busy) or inconsiderate (i.e. pick me up in driving conditions I know you're not comfortable with).\n\nIt's never \"hey, we should go to X this weekend, can you drive?\" I'm happy to do that. But I can't drop everything and drive her any place she likes. And it's horrible that she gets angry when I say no to those requests, especially after voicing my reasons and concerns.", "My gosh your gf is very entitled and ungrateful of you. She's treating you like an uber driver. If I spoke like that to my bf I wouldn't have a bf anymore lol. The silent treatment is not ok either. Needing some time to cool off is normal but when it becomes intentionally stonewalling it's unhealthy and abusive. And door slamming is also not normal.\n\nI think you need to have a serious talk with your gf about her toxic behaviors, selfishness, and angry outbursts. Tell her she needs to work on healthy communication and managing her negative emotions. Ask for her point of view but don't be manipulated if she gaslights you. Definitely don't feel guilty for saying no to unreasonable requests.", "It almost feels like some sort of childish test. She picks inconvenient times on purpose to see if you choose her. Not cool.", "Wait, she works an hour away and doesn't drive?  Does she take a bus or train? She's making ridiculous demands and throwing a tantrum when you don't do as she says.  You're NTA and your GF needs to get a grip", "She doesn't have her own license? Is there a reason she doesn't? This is concerning."]}
