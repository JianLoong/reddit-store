You worked the system. She was likely embarrassed over being turned away in the first place.", "Nope. You did not make a scene. A good host/hostess would have informed you that you could have a seat in 15 minutes. This is how it's always worked when I turn up to restaurants without a reservation. They tell me the next available slot (if there are any). And no, my outfit doesn't scream \"Money\". I understand, however, that your mother may have felt incredibly awkward and embarrassed. Any type of social anxiety or feeling you're not good enough for a social setting can kick in with the situation you've described. Whilst you executed some excellent malicious compliance, your mother might have felt like she tricked he'd way in and was subsequently judged. I'd honestly say NAH except the restaurant/hostess. You played their game perfectly, but your mother might have felt somehow lesser than and that may have upset her.", "NTA I think sounds like a generational thing. She asked for a reservation so you made one. It wasn\u2019t being rude, confrontational; or behaving inappropriately in any way.", "It\u2019s also possible they had a new policy regarding reservations (or even just for that day because they usually get busy) and the server didn\u2019t know. \n\nWhen I worked in restaurants, the servers often didn\u2019t know the host stuff and vice versa. And servers avoided learning host stuff so they couldn\u2019t be scheduled in a tipless position.\n\nEdited for spelling.", "15 minutes is no big deal, either, so it would have literally been her saying \"there will be a short wait\"\n\nWhat the hostess did was super weird and passive aggressive", "Uhh topless position?", "*tip-less probably", "*Tip less\n\nCorrected it. \n\nWhen I worked in restaurants, servers got tipped minimum wage ($5/hour+tips) and hostesses got regular minimum wage ($8/hour). You made less hosting. So servers went out of their way to know as little as possible so they wouldn\u2019t be \u201cforce hosted\u201d if we were short staffed.", "Guessing, but iirc 'top' is a term used a lot in restaurants to mean table (usually with a number indicating the number of seats/guests, so like a 4-top is a 4 person table), so in this instance I think 'topless' means no tables and therefore no tips", "NTA \nI have a similarly bashful mother, but my sisters and I are past the point of letting it be a deterrent. She got super embarrassed when some unmasked lady was up in their space while shopping at the height of the panini, and my sister turned and argued for their six feet. The lady backed off but my mom was so upset that my sister would behave in such a way. Ma you\u2019re alive and never caught the thing, whatever one pissed off ah with a Starbucks cup thinks of you won\u2019t kill you.", "NTA  I don't even understand what your mom thinks you shouldn't have done?  You did exactly as you should!", "NTA  \n\n\nYou didn't make a scene. You maybe called the hostess out on her bullshit, but you did it in the very nicest way possible.   \n\n\nI see zero problems here.", "So I was a hostess at a restaurant and something similar happened.\n\nWe were empty (we opened at 5 and it was 515 but by 530 the restaurant was completely booked. So a women her child and husband walked in wanting a table I told her we were booked and she said the restaurant was empty.  I explained that we have reservations coming in.\n\nShe offered to sit at the bar but I said she can\u2019t because of her child.\n\nAnyways we used open table and we had openings at 515. We couldn\u2019t access open table to get rid of them (idk why, this was years ago so maybe it changed but idk) so she booked a res in front of us for 515 and we sat her. \n\nAnyways she left a terrible review saying I discriminated against her for having a child.\n\nI would have just sat her from the get go and explained we were heavily booked for the night but my manager said no walk ins.\n\nAnyways maybe she was the asshole? Maybe the restaurant was booked shortly after you walked in? Maybe the restaurant had a problem with open table?\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is I don\u2019t think it was anything to do with you and your mom", "This story is super similar to a [r/MaliciousCompliance post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/zbmjas/fine_ill_book_my_own_table_then/) a few days ago.\n\nLooks like it got removed, but it's also [here](https://cheezburger.com/1879559/fine-ill-book-my-own-table-then-petty-customer-claps-back-at-hostess-who-smiles-rudely-at-him).", "I wouldn\u2019t think OP is an ah but as much as I love reading about a gotcha moment being an accomplice to one would make me so uncomfortable and anxious - like is that hostess having her waitstaff friends spit in my food? Even just the energy of that subtle confrontation would make me not want to be there so I do kind of get her POV in wanting to go elsewhere", "The mom is TA for not wanting make a scene?!?!? What have you veen drinking?", "Sorry to ask, are you both white?  I had a situation like this once and one of us was not white.  They ended up firing the hostess as we weren't the first 'problem'", "Why would someone spit in your food after they told you you needed a reservation and you went and got one? OP delivered her sweet sounding barb on the way out for a reason. \n\n\nI get this would make some people uncomfortable, but I don't think its reasonable. That's a level of conflict avoidance that borders on unhealthy.", "Did you read the part where the mom kept looking at the hostess every time she saw her sitting someone? Why would she do that? Yes, she is TA. And possibly she has been there, done that before, and the hostess remembers. Otherwise, why would the hostess behave like that and risk losing her job?", "There was no scene!", "Reddit plot twist: The hostess is OP's half-sister, but OP doesn't know it. Hostess tracked down mom and mom said no one knew about her, and she won't uproot her life to get to know her. \n\nSarcasm... in case it wasn't noticed.", "NTA. But I also don't think the host is an AH too. Sometimes there's miscommunication from the Managers/Servers about seating arrangements and how many people can be seated and provided QUALITY SERVICE. I've been both a host and server and i think you handled the situation well. The restaurant industry is a hit or miss regardless of where you go but i'm glad your experience went well", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything was fine.  YOur mom is an AH.

Confirm walk ins are ok and then let them know what happened. I\u2019m sure the manager would not be happy to know they were turning away business.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. The behavior of both your mom and the hostess are puzzling.", "NTA, but what is it you did that embarrassed your mother?", "NTA\n\nShe lied and got caught in it, and you complied by getting a  reservation.", "NTA - and it's funny that your mom was embarrassed by you standing up for yourself when it would typically be the parent that made a scene and embarrassed their kid.  \n\n\nSource: I'm a boomer and I have embarrassed my kid and I have learned my lesson.", "NTA, You just complied to their policy.  They wanted you to have a reservation, you made one.  You didn't raise your voice, you were polite, and you tipped well.  If dress code was a real policy, *they would have said that right there and then.*  A dress code is a very real thing and totally normal to have.", "NTA. I did the same with a snooty hostess.", "NTA - Moments like this are where you reach out to the owners, post on Yelp and Google letting people know, etc.\n\n\"The food was lovely, but unfortunately the power-tripping hostess had issues with ageism and casual attire (insert whatever other possible reasons) and attempted to refuse us service. Luckily the online reservation system had no such malicious constructs! I highly recommend using the online system until the management replaces the morally lackluster hostess.\"", "INFO:  I'm really really curious if everyone here was the same race. If there was some perceived discrimination I could see this reaction from your mom.", "I don\u2019t know why people see open seats and assume the fact that they are reserved is a lie \ud83d\ude02 they are open because .. they are reserved.. for the future people.. that\u2019s how it works\u2026\nAnyways NTA you did everything perfectly imo idk what your moms issue was", "Because they\u2019re understaffed and can\u2019t run smoothly if they\u2019re overcrowded.", "Standing up for what is right and following rules does not make you a jerk. The jerk was the hostess and how she handled the entire scenario. And possibly whoever hired her in the first place.", "What scene????? What have *you* been drinking?", "I think it is probably a policy for 'reservations only' and hostess is not allowed to seat walk-ins even if there is space or tables available. I know several restaurants that have this policy. Maybe something to do with analytics or tracking trends?", ">Why would someone spit in your food?\n\nThey probably wouldn\u2019t (I hope) but I\u2019m paranoid\n\n>That\u2019s a level of conflict avoidance that borders on unhealthy. \n\nI do not disagree with you lol"]}
