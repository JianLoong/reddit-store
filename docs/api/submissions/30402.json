{"id": 30402, "submission_id": "17ofvln", "title": "AITA for trying to get my oldest sister to give my other sister money for her custody case?", "selftext": "For context, Odie (28f) is my oldest sister and Elias (36m)is her husband, is my middle sister Anne (25f), and me (23m) is the youngest.\n\nA few years back, Odie received a large sum of money from a settlement at work. On top of this, Elias is an ER doctor. They share a crazy nice and expensive apartment, go on a few trips each year, and don\u2019t have any kids and don\u2019t plan on having kids so between everything, they\u2019re quite well off.\n\nAnne isn\u2019t doing as well as Odie and Elias, she\u2019s a single mom and has had a hard time keeping jobs due to her short fuse. Our parents have full custody of one of Anne\u2019s kids, but Anne has a 5 month old daughter and just recently found out she is again pregnant.\n\nRecently, our parents have started trying to get custody of Anne\u2019s 5 month old. Since our parents are working class, Odie and Elias gave my parents the money for the lawyer. Once all this got into motion, Anne was immediately at Odies door begging for money for a lawyer. Odie is a very sweet person and has a very hard time saying no to people. Elias makes up for this with his assertive personality so when he sees Odies struggling, he is very quick to say \u201cno she\u2019s not interested, she\u2019s being polite.\u201d Which is exactly what happened in this situation. Anne didn\u2019t take this well and said that she was asking Odie and Odie said she agreed with her husband. They argued and it got to the point where Elias nearly called the police to get Anne out of their house.\n\nSkip forward a couple weeks and Odie got really sick after an ovarian cyst ruptured (I think) and she needed surgery to remove the cyst? (I think that\u2019s what happened, that sort of thing makes me squeamish so I wasn\u2019t listening that well. Bottom line: she got sick and had surgery.)\n\nA few days later, her husband was back at work and my mom was with Odie for the day but my mom went to Bible study and Elias was expected to be home soon, he was just getting some groceries. This was when Anne came over and started asking Odie for money again. Odie was trying to get her to leave to avoid any conflict but Anne wouldn\u2019t and it took Elias coming home  and calling the police to get Anne to leave.\n\nAnne then came to me and explained her half of the situation to see if I could help. I went to Elias and did my best and he explained their half of the story, still I pressed for Anne because she just wants to keep her child and it\u2019s only fair that they give her money for a lawyer if they gave my parents money for a lawyer and I said it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have the money to give. He said no again so I asked to talk to Odie who was sleeping and Elias just said he thought I was better than that and told me to leave. Odie hasn\u2019t spoken to me since or answered my messages.\n\nAITA for trying to stand up for Anne?", "created_utc": 1699202531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ofvln/aita_for_trying_to_get_my_oldest_sister_to_give/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There\u2019s only one side. And that\u2019s that she is an irresponsible hothead who has no business having children. At all. None. Not now, probably not ever. She has a lot of nerve doing what she\u2019s doing to these people.\n\nYTA. Knock it off. Now.\n\nETA: You\u2019re lucky Elias is a decent guy. I would have had my proverbial boot so far up your ass for presuming to tell me what I should do with my money  and for harassing my sick wife, that you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nFixed a couple words that got mushed together", "YTA\n\nYou give Anne money then. Anne has lost her children by her own choices. You admitted that with the short fuse comment. Your sister doesn\u2019t have to give money that she and her husband earns to anyone. You and Anne are very selfish people.", "You really don't make much of a case for Annie. She's irresponsible. She can't keep a job due to her temper, she's having kids that she can't afford, and the police have to be called to remove her from Odie and Elias's place.\n\nNow you're pushing Odie and Elias for money to try to keep kids with an unfit mother!? Yes, **YTA**. You should be thinking about what's best for the kids, not about what Annie wants.", "They gave the money to the parents for a lawyer because they want the parents to get custody of the kids \u2026 that\u2019s pretty clear . \n\nThey think Anne is a loser who should not have her kids so why would they help her with a lawyer ? \n\nHow do you not see this ? YTA", "YTA.\n\nFace facts.  Your sister Anne is a loser.  The best thing that could happen to her is to lose custody so she can have the chance to straighten out her life without the added burden of THREE CHILDREN.  Do her a favor and stay out of it, unless you want to advise her to keep her legs closed together in the future.", "YTA.\n\nAnne is an unfit parent. She lost custody of her first child due to this fact and is on her way to losing the second for the same reason.\n\nWhat is hard to understand about this?\n\nYour older sister's husband is willing to fund your parent's side of the custody case because it is in the best interest of the child.", "YTA you have no right to tell people who they should give their money to. You really have some nerve and entitlement there if you think it was appropriate and to state what was or was not fair.  They didn't have to give money for a lawyer in the first place.\n\nAnne has the short fuse and responsible for her poor life decisions. Why don't you get another job to help her with money?", "YTA.  Stop trying to give other people's money away and mind your own business.", "YTA. They most likely gave the parents money because they side with them about the custody. Anne sounds like a breeding AH & if I was being harassed, I would get a restraining order ASAP!!  Good luck to those kids!!", "YTA for not minding your own business AND reposting the story because you didnt like the outcome", "YTA \n\nOdie is sick, after surgery, and Annie abused her during recovery? And you wanted to do the same? Are you serious?", "YTA. \n\nWhy should anyone support Anne? \n\nShe\u2019s lost one child, about to lose another and is now pregnant with a third child she may not be able to raise. \n\nShe can\u2019t financially support herself because she has anger issues. \n\nShe harasses your sister repeatedly to the point where cops get involved. \n\nIf Odie and Elias give money to your parents to try to get custody of the child, they are not *also* going to give money to Anne so she can keep custody of the child. That would negate the purpose of supporting either side. They\u2019ve chosen your parents over Anne. \n\nYou are too young and inexperienced to understand what\u2019s going on. Stay out of it.", "YTA.  I\u2019m Odie in my own story and I still have resentment for people in my family like you and Anne.  I\u2019m the youngest of 5 children but was the most successful.  My mom got really sick when I was 27 and I paid into her retirement fund so she could retire early.  I moved her in with me and began supporting her.  She, unfortunately, was very codependent with some of my siblings who were dysfunctional, so I was often bailing them out through her.  I never regretted taking care of her but there were times I resented the heck out of her.  I know it was my choice but I felt unbearable pressure.  She and two of my siblings have been gone for years and although I got therapy for my issues, there are still times that I get disgusted thinking about the situation.  Shame, shame, shame on you for trying to take advantage of Odie!", "YTA, the only money used should be to sterilise your sister. How on earth do you think that your sister should have any of her kids and why are you so quick to spend other people's money?\nYour poor oldest sister having two absolutely awful sisters, glad to hear that her husband is on her side.", "YTA your sister nor her husband owe your sister jack! It's THEIR money to spend how THEY want", "YTA.\n\nMind your own bizz", "YTA - the kids are the victims here not your sister, they deserve to be in a safe loving home and it\u2019s sounds like your sister Annie can\u2019t even take care of herself let alone 2 small children. Have you not realised why your other family are supporting your parents and not Annie?", "Yta\n\nHow about you either mind your own business, or *you* give her the money. \n\nWhat sense does it make for your sister to bankroll *both* sides of the case? Your sister needs to stop having kids she doesn't have the ability to raise. No one should be giving her money to keep children that she seems to be unfit to raise.", "Yta. So you decided it is only fair to give their money to the other sister. How is your right or your decision to give away their money? You asshole jerk.  If you want your other jerk of a sister to have money give her your money.  Your mom sure raised a bunch of self centered assholes.", "YTA. Anne sounds like a hopeless loser. Pony up the money yourself if you're so interested in helping her out. You don't get to dictate what other people spend their money on. Sorry.", "YTA.\n\nYour parents were given custody of one of Anne\u2019s kids for good reason. From the way you describe Anne, those reasons were valid. \n\nThey are now concerned with the welfare of another child under your sister\u2019s care, and likely the child that will result from this pregnancy too. If they are concerned enough to seek custody, then that\u2019s telling. \n\nOdie and Elias clearly support your parents in this, and have given funds to ensure those children grow up in a safe environment. Your sister is not a safe environment. She has no business having children, if she is an unfit mother. \n\nAnne can\u2019t keep a job, because of her temper. What if that temper is triggered on to any of her children? What if she hurts or kills one? What if she grabs a baby and shakes it? Those kids are not safe around her.\n\nYou do not get to decide how your sister and her husband use their money. It sounds like they have gone no contact with you. I don\u2019t expect they will be in touch with you. Good for them. Anyone who would deliberately ignore a situation where a child is in danger, is just as guilty of the fallout as the one who hurts the child.", "YTA. It's their money to do what THEY want with it. It doesn't matter how much they have. It's theirs. Anne is in no position  to keep having children she can't take care of. Your own parents don't want her to have custody.. Anne is the problem here. Take a step back and look who you're siding with. Leave Odie and her husband alone.", "YTA. Why would Odie and her husband fund Anne\u2019s lawyer when they are already funding the opposition?  What kind of mental gymnastics are you doing to think that makes any kind of sense?", "YTA- your parents are trying to get custody of the 5 month old(and already have the older child) because it is in the best interests of the children. And now short-tempered, underpaid, choosing beggar Anne is pregnant AGAIN? The only thing she should get money for is tubal ligation-she should not be having any more kids. But all of that is kind of irrelevant because you and Anne aren't entitled to other people's money, especially not money your sister got as a settlement  for an injury, money she needs to take care of herself. The nerve of you...", "YTA\n\nYou're meddling in things that do not have anything to do with you while you try to spend other people's money for them. Do you really think there's any way that you don't come out TA here? Stay in your lane.", "YTA.\n\nWhat Odie and Elis do with their money is up to them and is none of your concern. Your sister is currently ill and your first concern is not for her welfare but to scrounge money off her for your dead beat sister.\n\nBe honest, there is a good reason why Annw lost custody of her first child. Instead of trying to sort herself out she's went and got herself pregnant again. \n\nJust because your older sister does not have any children of her own it does not mean her hard earned money should be given to whoever asks. So what if she and her husband go on nice holidays. Good for them.\n\nApologise to Odie and Elis.", "YTA. Leave your sister and BIL alone. Your little sister is a complete asshole loser.", "OP, have you considered that your sister and her husband have already chosen which side they are on in this fight?  I mean, they gave *your parents* the money to sue for custody.  At this point, they would be pitting their money against itself if they also gave your sister money for the same court case.  However, THAT is not why YTA. You\u2019re the asshole for \u201cit\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have money to give.\u201d", "YTA and ann is an ah. Children are not take out of Families for No reason (=Ann is either abusiv, a shitte Mom or both).\n\nIf you want to Help ann step up and do something for her Kids or keep your Ass working to help her Out.\n\nYou and ann have an unhealthy, toxic and entiteld Attitude, odie is Not your Personal ATM or Shit Box\n\nLeave Odie alone!!!!!!\n\nElias Rocks, the only one who Loves and Cares about Odie", "YTA. Give Anne your own money if you think it\u2019s a worthy cause. Your other sister and BIL can spend their own money as they see fit. AND it seems Anne is not capable of being a mother because of her history.", "At bottom, YTA. I think you have misread the situation. Elias gave money to your parents because the thinks your parents should get custody of the baby, probably. It wouldn't make sense for him to back the other party, your sister Annie.\n\nAlso, it's Elias and Odie's money, and it's none of your business how they spend their money.\n\nThird, Annie is a complete mess. She repeatedly quits jobs because she can't manage her temper, and she's had two children she can't support and now is pregnant again. She doesn't need custody of her middle child, she needs to get her act together and start making better choices. Maybe you could encourage her to go into therapy and maybe give her some money to do this.", "YTA.\n\nI am curious as to why the sister lost custody of her oldest kid. OP stated her sister has a temper. My mind is veering off into \u201cab*se\u201d territory, which makes OP a bigger AH.", "YTA  Why would you want to see a child with a mother whose temper is so bad that they can't hold a job? So you sit back and watch the child be abused when she loses her temper on the child? Why would you want the child to go to a mother who can't hold a job? So you can watch the child be starved because the mom can't buy food because she can't hold a job? If she asks for money for anything it should be for therapy for her anger management. You owe your  BIL and sister apology for even asking. No good judge would give custody to your sister anyway until she gets her temper under control, lawyer or not. They'd just be throwing money down the drain.", "If you're sooo concerned over anne maybe use your money and stop getting your nappy in a twist over your sister being sensible and not giving money to a mental unstable person yta", "YTA \n\nFor clearly not understanding that there is a reason they gave your parents money to fight for custody. Your sister is 25, lost custody of one kid, has a baby and is pregnant again. Wtf bro?!? I had 3 kids by 25 too and guess what???? Never even close to losing any of them even though my first was at 17.", "YTA It doesn't make any sense to give both parties money to fight it out in court. They obviously believe your niece is better off with your parents. It sounds like she might be.", "If you want to help Anne, give her money.  STOP spending other people's money.\n\nYou and short fuse Anne need to leave Odie alone.  Disgusting to try to bilk her of money while she is recovering from surgery.\n\nYou and Anne are YTA s.  \n\nPS there is a reason your parents have custody of one child and are trying to get custody of another.  Look to why Anne is the problem and stop enabling her bad behavior", "YTA, by the way you should tell Anne breathfeeding is not equal to a contraceptive.", "You\u2019re a gaping a-hole. You seem like you just want to be a savior in the situation and feel good about yourself, but how good are you going to feel when one of Anne\u2019s kids is seriously hurt, either physically or emotionally, in her home? Do you even know why your parents had to take the first child, or does that give you the ick to think about, too? \n\nOr are you just staying willfully ignorant about what\u2019s REALLY happening with Anne so you can be high and mighty above the others who have had to step in and fix what Anne is STILL fucking up? YTA.", "YTA. Are you sure you are 23? Because it sounds like you are 13. Mind your own business and let the adults decide what is best for your obviously irresponsible and sluty sister's children.", "Anne really sounds like she needs to get her shit together before she's allowed to have custody of her kids.\n\nAnd Odie's money is hers too do with as she pleases. She has no obligation to Anne.\n\nYTA for butting in.", "YTA. You can\u2019t even get the nerve to pay attention fully to what happened to Odie, so you obviously don\u2019t help her at all\u2026but want to wake her up to ask for money for a chronically pregnant single parent with anger issues? Dude, just because she has money doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a person. And there is no \u201cfair.\u201d She and her husband obviously made a choice as to the best interest of a child (that isn\u2019t theirs), so WHY would they fund both sides? Also, hounding your recovering sister for money in the brief moment she\u2019s unattended is wild. You\u2019re too squeamish to help, but have the balls to ask for something? Tell me how THAT\u2019S fair.", "YTA. You're not standing up for Anne. You're putting your nose where it doesn't belong. Anne is a shit parent. That's why YOUR parents are trying to get custody. You're trying to screw that up by 'making it fair' for Anne. If Anne hadn't been such a shit parent in the first place, your parents wouldn't need to be fighting for custody. All Anne has to do is (gasp) not be a shit parent. If she can't manage that, what do you think wasting money on a lawyer will do? \n\nYou're clueless. Stay out of it.", "YTA. You want your hot tempered (and sounds unstable to me but I\u2019m not qualified to say) but fertile sister to have money for an attorney, then you can give it to her.  You can also move in with her and fill the role of a co-parent. You can help her become a good enough parent that the Courts will not decide it is in the best interest of the child to be with its grandparents rather than the mother.", "Anne is clearly a crappy parent when she already lost custody of one kid and is at risk of losing another. And now she's harassing your sister for money and you're helping her. How about you get off your ass and work to give her money? No, you'd rather treat your sister like an ATM. Anne is greedy and selfish and so are you. YTA", "Yes, YTA for standing up for Anne. Why would your sister give Anne money for a lawyer when they are giving your parents money to pay for a lawyer to gain custody? Your sister would then be supporting both sides, which does not make sense.\n\nAnne is a very poor parent if she keeps losing jobs because of her bad temper. She is also a lousy human being if she pressures her sister who has just come out of surgery. It is easy to understand why she cannot keep a job.\n\nHow did Anne get into the house anyway, if your mother and Elias were not there? Odie should not have let her in, and if Anne has a key, it should be taken from her.\n\nWhy are you helping a deadbeat like Anne? The ones who need help will be your parents, who are trying to raise two children at their age.\n\nYour loyalty is misplaced.", "YTA.  Your sister isn't responsible for your other sister's choices, even if she has money, she's not responsible financially for your other sister.  It's definitely not your place to be in this conversation at all.  Mind your own business.", "YTA For presuming what their finances are. You have no right to keep at them if they decided to not give your sister any money.", "So, your sister who keeps having kids she can\u2019t take care of came over and accosted your sister who is recovering from major surgery so that she can get money, and you\u2019re on her side? \n\nYTA", "Out of the entire cast of characters you\u2019ve introduced us to, *you* are the only one without a speaking role.  You have no part in this Greek tragedy.  You\u2019re an audience member.  In the grand scheme of things, yes\u2026standing by family is a good thing. The problem is, you\u2019re choosing the wrong family to back.  By her own choices and actions, Anne is the antagonist here.  Your parents have stepped up to raise children who are in danger of, at the very least, neglect.  At worst, abuse.  Go, Mom & Dad!  Odie & Elias are stand-up people who, after stepping back and evaluating the situation, have correctly decided to back the winning horse -that\u2019s your parents, by the way.\n\nAnother commenter said that people love to spend other people\u2019s money.  So true.  Here you are, not ponying up cash to back Anne yourself, no\u2026you\u2019re asking Odie & Elias to do it. The neck on you\u2026\n\nOdie sounds like a nice soul.  She\u2019s probably stepping back from you for a bit because she disagrees with what you want and, recovering from her ailment, really doesn\u2019t want to deal with you and your misguided attempts to even the playing field.  I suggest you send her a message (don\u2019t call or go over there) and let her know that after asking for an impartial opinion (us amazing nerds here), you\u2019ve realized you were wrong.  Ask her to accept your apology and let her know that you\u2019ll leave her be.  Let *her* pick the time to reach out to you.

She is making such huge scenes that she\u2019s had the cops called on her twice. You obviously love Anne and want the best for her but you have to think of what\u2019s best for her kid(s).

On top of this, Elias is an ER doctor. They share a crazy nice and expensive apartment, go on a few trips each year, and don\u2019t have any kids and don\u2019t plan on having kids so between everything, they\u2019re quite well off.\n\nAnne isn\u2019t doing as well as Odie and Elias, she\u2019s a single mom and has had a hard time keeping jobs due to her short fuse. Our parents have full custody of one of Anne\u2019s kids, but Anne has a 5 month old daughter and just recently found out she is again pregnant.\n\nRecently, our parents have started trying to get custody of Anne\u2019s 5 month old. Since our parents are working class, Odie and Elias gave my parents the money for the lawyer. Once all this got into motion, Anne was immediately at Odies door begging for money for a lawyer. Odie is a very sweet person and has a very hard time saying no to people. Elias makes up for this with his assertive personality so when he sees Odies struggling, he is very quick to say \u201cno she\u2019s not interested, she\u2019s being polite.\u201d Which is exactly what happened in this situation. Anne didn\u2019t take this well and said that she was asking Odie and Odie said she agreed with her husband. They argued and it got to the point where Elias nearly called the police to get Anne out of their house.\n\nSkip forward a couple weeks and Odie got really sick after an ovarian cyst ruptured (I think) and she needed surgery to remove the cyst? (I think that\u2019s what happened, that sort of thing makes me squeamish so I wasn\u2019t listening that well. Bottom line: she got sick and had surgery.)\n\nA few days later, her husband was back at work and my mom was with Odie for the day but my mom went to Bible study and Elias was expected to be home soon, he was just getting some groceries. This was when Anne came over and started asking Odie for money again. Odie was trying to get her to leave to avoid any conflict but Anne wouldn\u2019t and it took Elias coming home  and calling the police to get Anne to leave.\n\nAnne then came to me and explained her half of the situation to see if I could help. I went to Elias and did my best and he explained their half of the story, still I pressed for Anne because she just wants to keep her child and it\u2019s only fair that they give her money for a lawyer if they gave my parents money for a lawyer and I said it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have the money to give. He said no again so I asked to talk to Odie who was sleeping and Elias just said he thought I was better than that and told me to leave. Odie hasn\u2019t spoken to me since or answered my messages.\n\nAITA for trying to stand up for Anne?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Kids are not trophies you get to keep just because you popped one out! YTA", "OMGDS your sister does not owe ANYONE in your family money.

I can't believe you went to bother your sick recently-out-of-surgery nice sister only to try get her money for another sister you admit has problems keep jobs because of \"her short fuse\", have been retired custody of one child, have problems to support the one she has and is pregnant again despite of that. You are definitely the asshole, and there is no Anne's side, she has been retired the custody of her kid because of a reason. I hope Odie goes no contact with both of you and the next time Anne goes to bother her, Elias goes through with calling the police. I am sure being in jail for harrasing her sister will look well in her fight to retain custody of her children.", "By your own words, it doesn\u2019t sound like Anne needs custody of any of her children. They likely agree. Stay out of their pockets. YTA.", "YTA. Firstly, she said no. Even if she has a solid gold toilet, she is not obligated to give you all handouts. Secondly, Anne is in a hole because of her own choices. She\u2019s bad enough a parent that your PARENTS are fighting for custody of her kids. Why do you want those kids to stay with an irresponsible person who can\u2019t control her temper enough to even hold a job? It\u2019s especially f*cked that you both cornered her when she was alone, sick and vulnerable to pressure her AGAIN for hand outs.", "Loooool so you this it's only fair that your sister, who is unfit to care for the child(ren), cares for the children instead of your parents?? Where is your logic? In all of this...why in the everloving fuck would they help the people who want to take Anne's child AND Anne at the same time? Lmaoooo \n\nYou seem to think this is about money at all...is that fair to the children? To be forced with an unfit mother? Shame on you. Anne needs help, but not this kind. She's got issues to work through.  You should be supporting your parents. Anne has made zero logical and acceptable choices, nor acceptable behaviour going after Odie who just had surgery.

She has a lot of nerve doing what she\u2019s doing to these people.\n\nSeriously. OP, they gave your parents money because Anne is unfit to take care of the children she already has. This isn't some 'mom got $5 so Anne should get $5,' they're giving your parents money because *they don't think Anne should have custody of her children*. They're obviously not going to give Anne money to fight the custody case when they don't think her having custody is the right thing. Anne got her answer several times, you need to stay out of it.\n\nIf Anne is such a hot head that she can't even keep a job I don't want to think about the kind of parent she is.

One child she's lost custody of, a 5-month old, pregnant again and hassling her older sister for money to the point that they had to ring the police to get rid of her.
