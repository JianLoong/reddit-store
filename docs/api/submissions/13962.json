He then says that he asked me to be quiet, and when I would not he had to jinx me to get me to be quiet.\n\nI tell him that I don't like the jinx game because it makes me feel really shitty, but he says it is not a game and I have to respect it.\n\nAt this point I am getting quite frustrated and I tell him that at no point did he politely ask me to be quiet and that I will never respond well to being ordered around (like being told \"You talk too much\").\n\nI start crying again and he says \"I don't want to do this right now\".\n\nI left the bedroom and am now back in my office crying and typing this reddit.\n\nAm I the a-hole?\n\n\nEdit/update:\nOkay, so after writing this post I started going about my day, and after folding towels I went back into the bedroom to put them away and I was met with \"I'm sorry I hurt you\" which made my heart melt.\n\nWe talked and he told me that he really wanted some quiet and was frustrated that I did not get that. He had said it in a way I took as a joke and this frustrated him, which is why he felt the need to resort to the jinx-method.\n\nI apologized for not catching his genuine request, and I assured him that I would NEVER do it on purpose. If I know he wants some peace and quiet I will give it to him in a heartbeat. All I ask is that he ask me nicely, and I told him this.\n\nWe forgave each other for our miscommunication and we ended the conversation with cuddles and saying \"I love you\" to each other.\n\n\nThank you all so much for your comments!\nI need to respect and be more confident in my own boundaries and he needs to communicate more clearly so that I may also respect his.\ud83d\ude05", "created_utc": 1680603514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bejfh/aita_for_crying_over_being_ignored_and_expecting/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're both acting pretty childish here.", "This sounds like a teenager fight. Clearly neither of you are emotionally mature enough to be in an adult relationship if you can't talk like adults without either being rude or crying.", "ESH.  I get your bf's perspective. I enjoy quiet as well and some people have a compulsion to talk a lot.  But yeah, going about it the wrong way", "Stop talking to him. Find someone who is kind and loves listening to you. Leave some room for silence next time, but this relationship has passed its expiration date. NYA", "NTA. He is far too old to be acting like a child and wanting to emulate a TV show. Especially at the expense of his girlfriends feelings. \n\nConsider this relationship carefully. These are red flags.", "He basically told you to shut up & said it isn't a game....even after you explained your boundaries & trauma around being ignored. You are nta in the least. He is, however, being an ah.", "NTA.\n\nI used to do the jinx thing, too. When I was in *elementary school*. He needs to grow up; he's acting like a child. And yes, it *is* a game, and you don't have to play it if you don't want to.", "Being in a relationship means having tough conversation even when you don't like it. He needs to grow up and have adult conversions. HIMYM is a television series, it is NOT real life.\n\nNTA, of course", "You're NTA, but you should get into counseling. Retreating to the office to cry might seem like the right choice, but it reads to me like something a 14-16 year old would do.", "Info: why do you take \u201cyou talk too much\u201d as a joke? Isn\u2019t it more likely that he thinks you talk too much? Have you reflected on your conversations to see if he might have some cause to believe that?", "NTA, but it sounds like your problems could be solved with honest open communication.", "ESH. I can't say this applies to you specifically but it absolutely does to my hubby. Some people are just noisy. Even if our house is quiet on the rarest of occasions he has to sing or make other annoying sounds for attention. I work in an extremely noisy environment all day. To have just 30 min of quiet time would be heaven. \n\nI think you both need to learn how to communicate better with each other. If he needed some quiet time he should've expressed that in a way you wouldn't take it as a joke or be made to put in an adult time out.", "Maya Angelou was right - when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.

You both sound about 11.", "But why you joked about something that was serious request from him and you were offended by what he said?

She is happy to listen most of the time but there are instances after work, or if she\u2019s tired etc, where she just needs time to process her own thoughts and is quite happy to be in my company, but just needs a bit of quiet.\n\nJust know that him needing silence is not because of you, but likely just him needing to some time.", "ESH \n\nGrow up", "NTA except towards yourself. Why are you with this disrespectful AH?", "YTA Your exhausting.", "My question is, why are you staying together with him If he makes you feel shitty all the time?\n\n\nIn any case it\u2019s a ESH for me.

You need to stop playing children's games together, and he has to stop using them as an excuse to try to control you.", "You said you always take being told to be quiet as a joke because you won't let people talk to you that way. You've been letting him talk to you that way and he was not joking. You can choose to ignore it, as you have, but YWBTA to yourself for not realizing he is crossing your boundaries. You are NTA for being upset by it.", "NTA. I talk a lot aswell. I hate it when people act that way to me. Just tell me I'm being 'high energy' and you'd like to enjoy a moment of peace and quiet with me.\n\nHe is the AH for not communicating with you and making you feel this way. Ignoring you after you tried to discuss your feelings about the situation with him..\n\nHe either needs to accept you, your talkative ways and learn how to communicate about it, or this relationship is not going to go anywhere. Of course both of you need to work on it and it's up to you to learn how to notice when you are being 'too much' and dial it down a bit. But being who you are is not wrong. And the way he handled this, makes you feel as if you are wrong as a person. That makes him a complete AH.", "Your bf is acting like a 14yr old not an adult if he doesn't believe that's a game.

I can understand that he needs some quiet time and also that you talk a lot, you just have different personalities and thats ok. And I would suggest therapy for you because of the childhood trauma you said.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to find a way to communicate with him in a healthier way. He doesn't respect you or your boundaries. He's mean and acts like a bully.\n\nEither he reevaluates his attitude towards you or you should reevaluate your relationship with him. No one should be treated that way by their partner.", "NTA. Your feelings are valid and you are allowed to feel them.  Your boyfriend sounds like an AH who doesn't care.", "NTA \n\nHow people are saying E S H is beyond me. Your bf is being rude and outright mean.\n\nHonestly by age like 13 you should grow out of thinking TV shows can be emulated without consequence. Its true that on the show they do this jinx thing quite seriously and its seen as fine and dandy albeit annoying. It's not like that irl, you cant try to mandate someone not talking and expect them to still like you at the end of it. \n\nYou have specifically said you dont want to play like this, he is relentlessly telling you to be quiet despite your honesty.", "NTA, but honestly you both sound at least a decade younger than what you've listed", "NTA. Honestly, this does not sound like a healthy, mature relationship in the least. I talk a lot too, though, and I do know it can be irritating. I do try to read the room (and not take it personally when someone needs quiet), but his saying \u201cyou talk too much\u201d instead of just asking for some quiet in a mature, polite way is unacceptable. My daughter (11) also talks a lot too, and it does become a lot - I\u2019ve learned to say, \u201cI\u2019m on overload. Give me a moment please.\u201d \n\nShe knows that\u2019s a sign to ease up with the talking, and it also makes it a ME problem, not a HER problem. Your BF\u2019s unkind \u201cyou talk too much\u201d turned a him problem into a you problem, and then he punished you for not responding the way he wanted you to, instead of being direct and using his words like a grown up.\n\nAnd seriously, I play the jinx game too. With my 11 year old. So yeah, that\u2019s the maturity level of that.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to talk as much as you want. If he wants some quiet, he can be a big boy and politely say, \"hey I just want to relax right now. Can we chill right now and talk later?\"\n\nAnd while he is allowed to ask for some quiet, the fact that he didn't apologize to you and didn't to discuss the situation should tell you he doesn't care about your feelings and he's not mature enough to work with them either.\n\nAll in all, have a serious conversation with him and try to find a solution that helps both of you. If he doesn't listen or doesn't try to discuss this with you, please please PLEASE take this as your sign to break up with him. His behavior probably won't change", "NTA. If your partner wants some quiet then he needs to ask politely for quiet time.
