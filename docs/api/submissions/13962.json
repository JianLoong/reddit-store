He then says that he asked me to be quiet, and when I would not he had to jinx me to get me to be quiet.\n\nI tell him that I don't like the jinx game because it makes me feel really shitty, but he says it is not a game and I have to respect it.\n\nAt this point I am getting quite frustrated and I tell him that at no point did he politely ask me to be quiet and that I will never respond well to being ordered around (like being told \"You talk too much\").\n\nI start crying again and he says \"I don't want to do this right now\".\n\nI left the bedroom and am now back in my office crying and typing this reddit.\n\nAm I the a-hole?\n\n\nEdit/update:\nOkay, so after writing this post I started going about my day, and after folding towels I went back into the bedroom to put them away and I was met with \"I'm sorry I hurt you\" which made my heart melt.\n\nWe talked and he told me that he really wanted some quiet and was frustrated that I did not get that. He had said it in a way I took as a joke and this frustrated him, which is why he felt the need to resort to the jinx-method.\n\nI apologized for not catching his genuine request, and I assured him that I would NEVER do it on purpose. If I know he wants some peace and quiet I will give it to him in a heartbeat. All I ask is that he ask me nicely, and I told him this.\n\nWe forgave each other for our miscommunication and we ended the conversation with cuddles and saying \"I love you\" to each other.\n\n\nThank you all so much for your comments!\nI need to respect and be more confident in my own boundaries and he needs to communicate more clearly so that I may also respect his.\ud83d\ude05", "created_utc": 1680603514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bejfh/aita_for_crying_over_being_ignored_and_expecting/", "score": 452, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't say this applies to you specifically but it absolutely does to my hubby. Some people are just noisy. Even if our house is quiet on the rarest of occasions he has to sing or make other annoying sounds for attention. I work in an extremely noisy environment all day.

Ignoring you after you tried to discuss your feelings about the situation with him..\n\nHe either needs to accept you, your talkative ways and learn how to communicate about it, or this relationship is not going to go anywhere. Of course both of you need to work on it and it's up to you to learn how to notice when you are being 'too much' and dial it down a bit. But being who you are is not wrong.

Honestly, this does not sound like a healthy, mature relationship in the least. I talk a lot too, though, and I do know it can be irritating.

Your BF\u2019s unkind \u201cyou talk too much\u201d turned a him problem into a you problem, and then he punished you for not responding the way he wanted you to, instead of being direct and using his words like a grown up.\n\nAnd seriously, I play the jinx game too. With my 11 year old. So yeah, that\u2019s the maturity level of that.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to talk as much as you want.

Can we chill right now and talk later?\"\n\nAnd while he is allowed to ask for some quiet, the fact that he didn't apologize to you and didn't to discuss the situation should tell you he doesn't care about your feelings and he's not mature enough to work with them either.\n\nAll in all, have a serious conversation with him and try to find a solution that helps both of you. If he doesn't listen or doesn't try to discuss this with you, please please PLEASE take this as your sign to break up with him. His behavior probably won't change", "NTA.
