You\u2019re making more now, so he just tosses the \u2018ah now I don\u2019t have to work anymore\u2019 grenade.  Never did he say he\u2019ll cut back to try to work on art and make that a profit venture for awhile etc.  he simply assumed he doesn\u2019t have to do anything, and that\u2019s why you would lose respect for him.  As you say, there\u2019s no need for someone home with kids in school, so that\u2019s not his reasoning. He\u2019s saying you can afford for him to rest on his laurels so by Jove he\u2019s gonna.  Not very attractive, hence, lack of respect", "YTA. It seems like your husband made a fairly lighthearted remark about your success and you responded with an ultimatum - one that tells him no matter how successful you are, you'll never support him pursing his dreams.", "YTA for putting it that way instead of having a proper conversation about how your new circumstances should be used to both of your advantage. For example, maybe you could look at future plans and figure that if you both keep working and do X, Y, Z then you'll both be able to retire early. Or if you work full time and he drops back to 20 hours a week then it means he can handle such-and-such chores instead of sharing, and have time to work toward starting his dream business or whatever.\n\nThe important part is that you're both doing things toward your mutual goals. His personal goals are part of that and so are your personal goals. You both pull together to get there. It doesn't mean you both have to do the exact same things, just that you communicate and plan and agree on ways to adapt to new circumstances so everyone gets there.", "NTA, but maybe the both of you deserve to take a vacation. just cause your money got longer, doesn\u2019t mean his should get shorter. what if you want more time to enjoy your passions as well? how would he support that when he\u2019s quit his job?", "YTA- having a job and keeping a job you hate isn't the only way to show you have drive or ambition but more importantly you could have said that a lot nicer than I won't respect you anymore at all. Secondly you could always set up boundaries about how you expect it to function like a relationship is give and take l, so if he's giving less financially than isn't absurd or make you a lead off of Mad Men because you expect other things to be better taken care of since he isn't working full time. Thirdly does he know that you'd be fine with him being part time or did you just shut him down right out of the gate? I understand not wanting to pay for things associated with his art gas, materials, classes, etc. But if you didn't really explain that to him then you really can't expect him to be supportive in anything you undertake because you obviously don't think you should do it for him. If the entire depth of your relationship is who contributes what financially then you have another problem because it kinda of sounds like he either doesn't expect to make as much as you anytime soon or maybe likes his job a lot less than he lets on.", "Its always the artists dream to have a partner doing good enough to do art full time. YTA just for how you said it, but its not a thing he should expect of you either without an agreement between the both of you.", "YTA personally. It\u2019s one thing if he\u2019s sitting home doing nothing, but creating art and selling it (or trying to) isn\u2019t leeching. Leeching is doing nothing at all. \n\nWould you be ok with him finding a job he loves but a pay cut? Would you be ok with him working part time and creating art part time?", "NTA to me it's a bit odd that he assumed that he would be able to stop working to me. Also it's completely valid to respect that your partner has job and is able to provide not only for themselves but the family. \n\nIf he wants to take his art full time he should put enough effort in that it's making a profit and then have the conversation", "YTA. Im an artist who is stuck working their day job. You need to understand this: it\u2019s soul crushing and nearly impossible to make (good) art while also having a job. If my husband made enough to support us both he would want me to quit because he understands this. It would be an amazing gift to your husband and family to give him the freedom to explore his art without fear of losing your respect or stress from his job. I don\u2019t see a legitimate reason for you to deny him that.  It seems more that 1) you don\u2019t see making art as a \u201creal job\u201d and  2) you have some sexist views about men and work.", "INFO: What percentage of the household income is he currently bringing in?\n\nIf you were very rich, like earning tens of millions of dollars per year, to the point where the income from his day to day job was basically a rounding error, then I would say you'd be the asshole, since wanting him to work just because you have to work as well seems kind of pointless\n\nYou say you just recently hit 6 figures, so assuming your salary is around $100,000 per year, then as long as he is earning $5,000 or more per year, then I think it's valid for you to want him to continue contirbuting to the family finances, but if he's earning less than that, then I think it would be valid for him to point out that what he is earning is negligible, and the two of you should find a way for him to contribute to the family's future in other ways.", "ESH\n\nYour husband should not have assumed that you would take on the full financial responsibility, and you should not have been so harsh in your response.\n\nYou guys need to sit down together and come up with a plan that reflects your goals and new financial situation. You are supposed to be a team, so no one should leave that conversation feeling neglected or taken advantage of", "NTA\n\nThat's how you feel. Are you supposed to lie? From your post history, it sounds like becoming the breadwinner has strained your relationship. If you put yourself in the position of supporting everyone financially, this could easily not work out and result in you paying alimony/child support. You also don't sound confident he will fulfill SAHP responsibilities. \n\nTo all the people in the comments saying they would take on financial responsibility so their partners could pursue their dreams... That doesn't mean OP has to. Especially when their relationship is on shaky grounds to start with. And this pay bump is recent. If something goes awry, do they have enough savings to sustain them? Being the sole income earner is a huge stressor and responsibility. \n\nIf you want to consider this route, sit him down and go over expectations. Does he understand and accept that he will be taking over primary parent duties and the bulk of household management/domestic labor? He can't just invest all his time into art. If he's staying home, his primary role would be supporting his family. With his leftover time, which he's sure to have, he can invest in his passions. Since you are not confident he will fulfill this role, I would suggest you do a trial period. Let him take vacation days and give it a try.", "YTA for how you said this. I get that your feelings are legitimate, but you completely shut down the conversation. Working a crappy job, as you know, is soul-stealing, and I would imagine your husband is desperate to get out. Would it be so bad to have a conversation about how he could turn his art to a business? Could you ask him to set up a business model? If he can't, that can lead to a different conversation about roles in the household and/or your values around work. But shutting him down completely AND insulting him by implying he is a leech? Not a great move.", "YTA", "NTA I could quit and let my husband pay for it all, but he would leave me. He can afford it, but never wanted a stay at home partner and neither would I. I could never look at him the same either. It isn't fair to you, what if something happens to your job? All the financial stress falls on just you and that isn't fair. I couldn't respect a partner who doesn't work, it is a deal breaker for me. You want a partnership, that was what was decided upon. Every relationship is diff and some people are fine supporting other adults, you aren't and you made that clear. I don't blame you!!!", "NTA. I\u2019m with you. Even if we could afford for one of us to stop working, I respect ambition and drive to be successful at something (job related). (And for this reason I couldn\u2019t be with someone that was constantly complaining about their job, either.). It\u2019s just another trait or preference like any other when choosing a partner.", "I don't think either of you have considered the important variables.  If he wants to quit his job, you both should be in agreement and should have contingency plans, especially since you have children. What would happen if he quits and then you lose your job? If you are in the U.S. and neither of you has jobs, then what about health care? Do you have enough in savings to cover long-term job loss on your end and/or unexpected medical costs? \n\nWhat are his goals if he quits his job? Is he trying to create enough art to sell in a gallery? \n\nIf he were to quit, would you need to cut back on certain luxuries in order to meet your financial goals (e.g. retirement, college funds, vacations, extras)?  Is your husband willing to make those sacrifices in luxuries in order to still meet your family's financial needs/goals? \n\nI wonder if your losing \"respect\" for your husband is that you don't believe that he would work at his art, that he has no goal but to dabble in a hobby.  If he were a successful artist, would you not respect him?  How do you define success?  \n\nBut issues of \"respect\" aside, there needs to be a plan, especially since you have kids.\n\nIn the absence of this, ESH.", "YTA for saying he\u2019d be leeching when he\u2019d actually still be working. Putting more time and effort into his art to be able to make a profit from it *is* work. I get not wanting to be the sole provider, but would it really kill you to have him drop to part time and spend the remaining time focusing on building an art career? He\u2019s your husband, not a lazy roommate.", "NTA.\n\nHe didn't discuss it with you, he just started saying how much he was looking forward to not working anymore. Like it was a done deal.\n\nThese are things that need to be discussed and agreed on. And you are well within your rights to say you don't want to be the sole breadwinner, even if you make enough to do so. That would be a deal breaker for a lot of folks.", "Light YTA here, leaning towards both NAH and ESH since you guys are having a very important conversation without mutual understanding or a productive approach. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for wanting a partner who contributes, shares your values, etc. Not at all. However, you need to be open to a conversation about HOW he wants to contribute. \n\nIf he wants to stay home with the kids and do housework (kids usually benefit from having a parent at home no matter what age) or try to make a living off of his art, he has the right to talk to his partner about redefining his responsibilities and roles without his partner threatening to lose all respect for his life plans. He\u2019s stressed and wanted to start a conversation about being less stressed. He opened it the wrong way, but the conversation is worth having. \n\nYou said you would struggle together, but currently you\u2019re not struggling (congrats, by the way) and he\u2019s not feeling like you\u2019re together on it. It\u2019s reasonable to tell him that you don\u2019t want to financially support a guy who does nothing but play video games, but I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s necessarily what he\u2019s asking for. You\u2019re getting YTA votes because you\u2019re not communicating with him in good faith. \n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re stressed out at your job and I\u2019m willing to rework this, but I\u2019m afraid that everything is going to fall on me\u201d is MILES away from \u201cI\u2019ll lose all respect for you.\u201d Sit down for a long talk about values, concerns, financials, stressors, retirement, plans, etc. Don\u2019t make it an ultimatum about basic human respect.", "ESH. You because you don\u2019t support him ride or die. Him for thinking his woman would wear the pants and still respect him.", "NTA.\n\nit is kind of weird how once you ended up making six figures he automatically says that he won't need a job anymore, sure he might want to do his art but you can still do both. you should not have to financially provide for both of you just because you are starting to make more money.", "YTA\n\nRespecting your husband should not be based on whether or not they have a job. He has a dream of being an artist and if there is a chance you could support him in that than why wouldn't you? If the roles were reversed would you be happy if he denied you your dream? I'm not saying it would be OK for him to sit around and do nothing all day but somone working towards making their dream a reality is definitely someone worthy of respect.", "Soft YTA. This sounds like a sexist point of view. Is it because he's a man? I'm the breadwinner in my marriage and I have never once thought less of my husband.", "If he\u2019s not helping much around the house (as you mentioned) then why should he get to stop working? NTA", "NTA, but - if you would be OK with him going half time, tell him so. Agree on how much - eg 25 hours per week. Without adding to his chores if he is actually going to get art work done!\n\nAnd work with him on establishing milestones - so many art pieces completed, so many art shows attended to get visibility, pieces listed for sale, art classes taken - that kind of thing. So you know he is actually working on it.", "You\u2019re NTA for how you feel, and while I think your delivery was abrupt, he did not present this scenario to you as something he wanted to discuss, he just told you he plans to quit working. \n\nMaybe he was trying to soft-launch the idea with you that he be able to make that shift, and I think this warrants more conversation between you two, but you\u2019re right, he doesn\u2019t get to make the decision to just quit unilaterally. \n\nHave a bit of a think about what would make sense for your family, where you want to be long-term, and where his aspirations can fall into that. \n\nIt\u2019s possible to make a living with your art, but you need to get on the same page about a plan, how that looks, and what you\u2019re willing to do to support his interests. And where he would contribute to the family outside of financially.", "ESH, you nearly got nta but the way you phrased it was unnecessary.  If he wanted to change the dynamic and give up paid work he shouldn't have tried to ambush you with it.  I would suggest you sit down and try and have an adult conversation.  Maybe he could drop a day or two,  take over more of the house/child care and paint while the children are at school", "NTA for expecting your husband to still be working and being a financial provider despite your 6 figure income. \n\nYTA for telling him he would lose your respect if this is the first time having this conversation and thats your immediate first response.", "YTA. Couples usually handle these situations by having adult discussions about it. It\u2019s not cool that he made the assumption he could completely stop working, but why are you treating him like a leech? You should\u2019ve had an actual conversation with him about it instead of saying something so extreme. You said yourself he\u2019s always wanted to make his art full time, it\u2019s not like he saw this as his ticket to sit on the couch and play video games all day. Sit down with him, go over your finances together, see if it\u2019s even possible for him to work less and still maintain your standard of living. Like just TALK about it like grown ups??", "My cousin doesn\u2019t have kids and he doesn\u2019t work cause she makes mega bucks. He takes care of the house, etc.  works for them.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. It\u2019s hard to know from the post how serious he was about the idea, but as it was just one comment, I think it\u2019s pretty understandable for him to daydream about quitting his job to pursue his passion, or even possibly to joke about it to defray the possible awkwardness of being substantially out-earned by his wife (not that I think that ought to be embarrassing, of course). Unless you know for sure he was dead-serious, you came down pretty hard on him. It\u2019s okay to clarify that you wouldn\u2019t be down for this and you want to make sure you\u2019re on the same page, but in saying that you would lose respect for him, you actually (possibly unintentionally, possibly not) told him that your respect for him is dependent on his *paid* work, which implies you may have already lost respect for him because he contributes less than you financially. It was unnecessarily harsh when a simple statement that you wouldn\u2019t be on board with that would have sufficed.", "NTA.  If it were me, he'd be losing a lot more than my respect, he'd be losing me as a partner.  He sounds like he thinks he's got a sugar momma.", "It\u2019s not the message, it\u2019s the way you delivered it. You already lack respect for your husband. If you didn\u2019t you wouldn\u2019t talk down to him that way.\n\n\nYta\n\n\n\nI hope he gets to throw those words back in your face someday.", "NTA\n\nIt would be a different story if he had come to you with a conversation about this rather than just assuming that now that you are doing so well financially he can stop working. He should not just be expecting this of you. It should have been broached as a \u201choney, you have become so successful and I would really like to be able to spend more time in my art, is there a way we could make it work with our family that I don\u2019t work as much anymore or at all?\u201d Then you can get into the logistics of how to balance work around the house because, yes, if he\u2019s not working or providing child care, he should be doing more around the house. That\u2019s not patriarchal it\u2019s just contributions to the household. Currently his contribution is working full time. It\u2019s completely reasonable that if you are working full time and he\u2019s not working he should take on more of the household maintenance and management. \n\nThat being said I think you should have more of a conversation about this to tell him where you are coming from and why you feel the way you do about it, rather than just telling him you wouldn\u2019t have any respect for him if he stopped working.", "YTA for how you said that. \n\n  \nTalk to your partner, and figure something out.  \nMaybe you did that 50/50 thing a lot time ago and it stuck, but things can change.  \nThat half time job sounds a good idea, but be sure about what you expect about the relationship, what you are willing to offer and what you aren't willing to do about all this. In mi personal opinion, I'd ask him to make good savings before moving careers or something. Good luck!", "NTA.\n\nHaving one person support both of you is a two yes one no discussion.

I was a stay-home father for 12 years while my wife ran one company, sold it, started another, and sold that one too. There is nothing inherently masculine or feminine about who earns more money; this is backward, reductive thinking. My wife tells everyone in her work life she absolutely couldn't have done what she has in her career without my support. Am I less of a man? Do you think she doesn't respect me? Grow up and put away this sexist bullshit.", "Yeah I feel like OP and a lot of the NTA comments are assuming hubby would just sit at home and do his art while OP pays for everything. Which may very well be true, I don\u2019t know this man. But I\u2019m not going to *assume* that he wouldn\u2019t take over the bulk of household responsibilities just because he\u2019s a man. There are plenty of stay at home moms with school age kids!", "Because pursuing his dream puts sole responsibility on her to support the entire financials. She also said lose respect not less of a man", "This is definitely an important distinction and will absolutely take this from NTA to a huge YTA for me.", "This is kind of the way I see it. I\u2019ve always supported his art, and like I said I\u2019d even be happy to see him move to a part time schedule while the art starts earning money. But I always wanted a working partner. And important detail my job is very volatile. I could have a totally different income in a year. It\u2019s fairly stable but I\u2019d like him to have retirement savings and such as well", "I think this is the correct answer.  I am ok with my spouse having no income, but I will be not OK if the spouse has no ambition.  \n\nOp should talk and ask what the husband wants to do instead recreationally paint or is there some larger purpose there. .  Leading a retired life is not an option, according to me.", "She\u2019s not necessarily making a ton of money, especially considering children are involved - It sounds like she\u2019s in the very-low 6-figures to me.\n\nI also think you\u2019re reading her comment about the relationship between work and respect ungenerously.", "I can think of multiple couples where the wife is the breadwinner and the husband pursued DJ-ing while handling a lot of the household duties.  The husbands may not have a traditional schedule or a salary, but they definitely have paying gigs and work on their craft, plus they can prepare for their gigs at home (making mixes, etc.) vs. having to go somewhere else, making it easy to always have someone at home with the kids.", "THIS ^\n\nOP  Which of u/Dittoheadforever's paragraphs describes your husband at the moment?\n\nHow good is your his husband and haswork been critiqued by professionals/art dealers to see if he has any talent.", ">I mean, what kind of six-figure salary are we talking about here? A bit over $100k isn't really that much when you have a family.\n\nAlso, what kind of salary would he be giving up if he quit? If he was bringing in $60k a year at his current job, then he's giving up a much larger percentage of the family's income by quitting than if his salary was $20k a year", "Yes I think the way you said it was harsh, but if you feel that strongly about it. I also think that letting him know that you find it unacceptable that you would fully support him is better for him to know upfront.", "> How would you feel if your husband said if you stopped working he would lose all respect for you?\n\nShe didn't say she'd lose **all** respect. Just that she'd lose respect quote below. Also why wouldn't she agree with the reverse?\n\n> if you stop working, I will lose respect for you.\n\nAlso there's a major difference between being laid off and quitting your job.", "If you can't make money part time, you won't full time. If he's that serious about being a painter he should put some work in and show it's financially viable. \n\n> This capitalist mentality of working a crap job just to be working is BS.\n\nI'm a straight man and I find it unattractive if my partner didn't have a paying job. It's not capitalism it's simply to me at least that they aren't providing for themselves or the relationship.", "She just started making good money and prob wants trips, and other luxuries. If he quits there goes all the extras for the family. How is that fair, she worked hard and is rewarded by her partner giving up and not contributing to their household expenses. What about her dreams/wants?", "If he took over the housework like that I think I\u2019d consider it tbh. He\u2019s never really fully offered, it sounded like he kinda wanted to just quit his job and do whatever he wanted. If it was presented that way I\u2019d have had a way different reaction I think", "> YTA if: He's willing to take up the household slack and to 98% of childcare, cleaning, chores, cooking, shopping, shuttling the kids places, etc.\n\n> YTA for the losing respect comment. SAHPs do a LOT of work, just a different type of work than going into a job outside of the house.\n\nThe kids are school aged, if they managed before there's really not much benefit to a SAHP now.", "I have a friend who did something similar with her wife. Her wife went down to part-time and the money from her job pays for her classes, supplies, etc. Nothing changed in the home because there is no money from the main breadwinner being used to fund her comic book career. It might not work out, it might fail, but if it does it is not a huge loss.", "This is the correct answer. Talk to each other!", "Idt having a job alone shows having drive/ambition but the idea of suddenly putting the pressure of financially supporting the whole family solely on her seems unfair", "Really, why is it intense? I would 100% lose respect for my husband if he quit his job and sponged off me. It's a deal breaker for me, I would leave him in a heartbeat. And if the roles were reversed I know he would feel the same.", "> There are plenty of stay at home moms with school age kids!\n\nYeah but it's past the time where it's truly needed both fiscally and developmentally. Also not really a fair workload split. He's a grown adult it's a fair expectation that he stay employed.", "OP says they can afford it, so your first point is moot. And tell me the difference between \"lose respect\" and less of a man... I'll wait.", "That completely makes sense. Have him bank his entire paycheck toward savings and see how you get by for a year. If your income has a chance of dropping he\u2019d be crazy to quit unless his art is bringing in a steady amount you can count on.", "OP says her husband has a crap job: well, crap jobs are easy to find. Once she's bringing in a certain amount, supposing he quits the crap job and spends an agreed-upon time period (such as (one year) working on his art (taking on some extra household chores in the meantime since he'll be saving commute time). \n\nIf at the end of whatever time period they decide on he's not made significant progress, he can get another crap job.", "This is correct. There's a difference between \"I want to do art\" and \"This is already bringing in some money and with more focus I can make more money from it\". \n\nI'm involved in an arts scene and the smart people work day jobs until their art pays enough to have savings to take that risk of cutting down day job hours. It's hard work but worth it when they \"break through\". \n\nThere's multiple people in my scene who could probably quit the day job now, but they like the security. OP's husband should already be proving his art is showing business potential in order to justify more hours being spent on it.", "Example of rational thought, not everyone has that. \n\nAgain, soft OP is YTA. People tend to forget that others are human in this place. \n\nThe quote you provided shows the wording. It says nothing about quitting or being laid off. It's pretty clear any reason why he stops working = she loses respect for him from a rational point of view with that sentence. \n\nYou are right about the \"All\" word. However, I will not change it as my point still stands for a reflective example. \n\nYou'd be surprised how many people would say the above to their spouse, but expect that once the spouse makes enough money, they can quit their jobs and \"sponge off\" of the spouse.", "Wait, does he want to be an artist, or does he want to just do whatever? \n\n\"Hey, since you're making enough to support the family, so I can quit now, right? Oh, uh, and, I guess I can finally do my art more, or something\"\n\nIs worlds different from:\n\n\"Hey, since you're making enough to support the family, I'd love to quit this crappy job and finally dedicate myself to being an artist.\"\n\nPlus, the volatility of your job isn't  mentioned in the OP, and is a very important detail. You mention nothing about undue financial pressure, it's couched purely in terms of lacking respect for him if he doesn't work. Again, those are very different things. The former is totally understandable; the latter is mean-spirited.", "yeah i mean from an effort perspective it should be fair\n\nit seems like he gave up when she started making more, since he said \"soon  \ni don't have to work\"\n\neven if the salaries don't match, the effort should match", "Yeah I think most people would lose respect for their partner if they decided to quit working. It's different if they have an illness or are taking care of the children. But otherwise it's a deal breaker", "Those 2 things have completely different meanings to men", "Someone very close to me is a DJ but has other things to fall back on (passive income plus a flexible sales job with some loyal organizations as clients). He's incredibly talented as an artist but likes the stability he has now.", "You can ditch the 'meanings to men' qualifier. It's not a gendered thing. They're just different things.\n\nSaying \"you're less of a man(woman/person) if you don't work\" is quite different from \"I wont look at you the same if you unilaterally make the decision not to work and leave it entirely to me\".\n\nOne is espousing that somehow ones value can be lost due to not working, while the other is simply expressing how one would feel if their partner made that decision.\n\nI can lose respect for someone for whatever behavior while it doesn't diminish their value as a person.\n\nTwo different things.", "Really?? Explain it to me... like I asked.", "as a man I\u2019d love to have you explain this difference to me.", "And that's how \"being an artist\" works these days. The hustle is real and you can't survive just doing one thing. You need multiple streams that may be connected to the main but are also funding the main.\n\nSo, comedians who also act and host events. Visual artists who create corporate logos. Writers who moonlight creating website copy. And so on.\n\nOP's hubby seems to think being an artist is a life of leisure where you sometimes art \"when the muse strikes\" but it's not. It's a constant hustle.", "I'm good with this", "I don't think you'd get it. \n\nRegardless my point is that any unforeseen circumstance could be made much worse because her husband is not working.", "YOU definitely wouldn't get it lol", "Mmm-hmmm... in other words, you know there's no difference, so you brought the moot point up... again. \n\nGo away.", "Someone gave a nice explanation below if you will"]}
