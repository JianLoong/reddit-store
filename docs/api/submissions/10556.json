You\u2019re making more now, so he just tosses the \u2018ah now I don\u2019t have to work anymore\u2019 grenade.  Never did he say he\u2019ll cut back to try to work on art and make that a profit venture for awhile etc.  he simply assumed he doesn\u2019t have to do anything, and that\u2019s why you would lose respect for him.  As you say, there\u2019s no need for someone home with kids in school, so that\u2019s not his reasoning. He\u2019s saying you can afford for him to rest on his laurels so by Jove he\u2019s gonna.  Not very attractive, hence, lack of respect", "YTA. It seems like your husband made a fairly lighthearted remark about your success and you responded with an ultimatum - one that tells him no matter how successful you are, you'll never support him pursing his dreams.", "YTA for putting it that way instead of having a proper conversation about how your new circumstances should be used to both of your advantage. For example, maybe you could look at future plans and figure that if you both keep working and do X, Y, Z then you'll both be able to retire early. Or if you work full time and he drops back to 20 hours a week then it means he can handle such-and-such chores instead of sharing, and have time to work toward starting his dream business or whatever.\n\nThe important part is that you're both doing things toward your mutual goals. His personal goals are part of that and so are your personal goals. You both pull together to get there. It doesn't mean you both have to do the exact same things, just that you communicate and plan and agree on ways to adapt to new circumstances so everyone gets there.", "NTA, but maybe the both of you deserve to take a vacation. just cause your money got longer, doesn\u2019t mean his should get shorter. what if you want more time to enjoy your passions as well? how would he support that when he\u2019s quit his job?", "YTA- having a job and keeping a job you hate isn't the only way to show you have drive or ambition but more importantly you could have said that a lot nicer than I won't respect you anymore at all. Secondly you could always set up boundaries about how you expect it to function like a relationship is give and take l, so if he's giving less financially than isn't absurd or make you a lead off of Mad Men because you expect other things to be better taken care of since he isn't working full time. Thirdly does he know that you'd be fine with him being part time or did you just shut him down right out of the gate? I understand not wanting to pay for things associated with his art gas, materials, classes, etc. But if you didn't really explain that to him then you really can't expect him to be supportive in anything you undertake because you obviously don't think you should do it for him. If the entire depth of your relationship is who contributes what financially then you have another problem because it kinda of sounds like he either doesn't expect to make as much as you anytime soon or maybe likes his job a lot less than he lets on.", "Its always the artists dream to have a partner doing good enough to do art full time. YTA just for how you said it, but its not a thing he should expect of you either without an agreement between the both of you.", "YTA personally. It\u2019s one thing if he\u2019s sitting home doing nothing, but creating art and selling it (or trying to) isn\u2019t leeching. Leeching is doing nothing at all. \n\nWould you be ok with him finding a job he loves but a pay cut? Would you be ok with him working part time and creating art part time?", "NTA to me it's a bit odd that he assumed that he would be able to stop working to me. Also it's completely valid to respect that your partner has job and is able to provide not only for themselves but the family. \n\nIf he wants to take his art full time he should put enough effort in that it's making a profit and then have the conversation", "YTA. Im an artist who is stuck working their day job. You need to understand this: it\u2019s soul crushing and nearly impossible to make (good) art while also having a job. If my husband made enough to support us both he would want me to quit because he understands this. It would be an amazing gift to your husband and family to give him the freedom to explore his art without fear of losing your respect or stress from his job. I don\u2019t see a legitimate reason for you to deny him that.  It seems more that 1) you don\u2019t see making art as a \u201creal job\u201d and  2) you have some sexist views about men and work.", "INFO: What percentage of the household income is he currently bringing in?\n\nIf you were very rich, like earning tens of millions of dollars per year, to the point where the income from his day to day job was basically a rounding error, then I would say you'd be the asshole, since wanting him to work just because you have to work as well seems kind of pointless\n\nYou say you just recently hit 6 figures, so assuming your salary is around $100,000 per year, then as long as he is earning $5,000 or more per year, then I think it's valid for you to want him to continue contirbuting to the family finances, but if he's earning less than that, then I think it would be valid for him to point out that what he is earning is negligible, and the two of you should find a way for him to contribute to the family's future in other ways.", "ESH\n\nYour husband should not have assumed that you would take on the full financial responsibility, and you should not have been so harsh in your response.\n\nYou guys need to sit down together and come up with a plan that reflects your goals and new financial situation. You are supposed to be a team, so no one should leave that conversation feeling neglected or taken advantage of", "NTA\n\nThat's how you feel. Are you supposed to lie? From your post history, it sounds like becoming the breadwinner has strained your relationship. If you put yourself in the position of supporting everyone financially, this could easily not work out and result in you paying alimony/child support. You also don't sound confident he will fulfill SAHP responsibilities. \n\nTo all the people in the comments saying they would take on financial responsibility so their partners could pursue their dreams... That doesn't mean OP has to. Especially when their relationship is on shaky grounds to start with. And this pay bump is recent. If something goes awry, do they have enough savings to sustain them? Being the sole income earner is a huge stressor and responsibility. \n\nIf you want to consider this route, sit him down and go over expectations. Does he understand and accept that he will be taking over primary parent duties and the bulk of household management/domestic labor? He can't just invest all his time into art. If he's staying home, his primary role would be supporting his family. With his leftover time, which he's sure to have, he can invest in his passions. Since you are not confident he will fulfill this role, I would suggest you do a trial period. Let him take vacation days and give it a try.", "YTA for how you said this. I get that your feelings are legitimate, but you completely shut down the conversation. Working a crappy job, as you know, is soul-stealing, and I would imagine your husband is desperate to get out. Would it be so bad to have a conversation about how he could turn his art to a business? Could you ask him to set up a business model? If he can't, that can lead to a different conversation about roles in the household and/or your values around work. But shutting him down completely AND insulting him by implying he is a leech? Not a great move.", "YTA", "NTA I could quit and let my husband pay for it all, but he would leave me. He can afford it, but never wanted a stay at home partner and neither would I. I could never look at him the same either. It isn't fair to you, what if something happens to your job? All the financial stress falls on just you and that isn't fair. I couldn't respect a partner who doesn't work, it is a deal breaker for me. You want a partnership, that was what was decided upon. Every relationship is diff and some people are fine supporting other adults, you aren't and you made that clear. I don't blame you!!!", "NTA. I\u2019m with you. Even if we could afford for one of us to stop working, I respect ambition and drive to be successful at something (job related). (And for this reason I couldn\u2019t be with someone that was constantly complaining about their job, either.). It\u2019s just another trait or preference like any other when choosing a partner.", "I don't think either of you have considered the important variables.  If he wants to quit his job, you both should be in agreement and should have contingency plans, especially since you have children. What would happen if he quits and then you lose your job? If you are in the U.S. and neither of you has jobs, then what about health care? Do you have enough in savings to cover long-term job loss on your end and/or unexpected medical costs? \n\nWhat are his goals if he quits his job? Is he trying to create enough art to sell in a gallery? \n\nIf he were to quit, would you need to cut back on certain luxuries in order to meet your financial goals (e.g. retirement, college funds, vacations, extras)?  Is your husband willing to make those sacrifices in luxuries in order to still meet your family's financial needs/goals? \n\nI wonder if your losing \"respect\" for your husband is that you don't believe that he would work at his art, that he has no goal but to dabble in a hobby.  If he were a successful artist, would you not respect him?  How do you define success?  \n\nBut issues of \"respect\" aside, there needs to be a plan, especially since you have kids.\n\nIn the absence of this, ESH.", "YTA for saying he\u2019d be leeching when he\u2019d actually still be working. Putting more time and effort into his art to be able to make a profit from it *is* work. I get not wanting to be the sole provider, but would it really kill you to have him drop to part time and spend the remaining time focusing on building an art career? He\u2019s your husband, not a lazy roommate.", "NTA.\n\nHe didn't discuss it with you, he just started saying how much he was looking forward to not working anymore. Like it was a done deal.\n\nThese are things that need to be discussed and agreed on. And you are well within your rights to say you don't want to be the sole breadwinner, even if you make enough to do so. That would be a deal breaker for a lot of folks.", "Light YTA here, leaning towards both NAH and ESH since you guys are having a very important conversation without mutual understanding or a productive approach. \n\nYou\u2019re not the asshole for wanting a partner who contributes, shares your values, etc. Not at all. However, you need to be open to a conversation about HOW he wants to contribute. \n\nIf he wants to stay home with the kids and do housework (kids usually benefit from having a parent at home no matter what age) or try to make a living off of his art, he has the right to talk to his partner about redefining his responsibilities and roles without his partner threatening to lose all respect for his life plans. He\u2019s stressed and wanted to start a conversation about being less stressed. He opened it the wrong way, but the conversation is worth having. \n\nYou said you would struggle together, but currently you\u2019re not struggling (congrats, by the way) and he\u2019s not feeling like you\u2019re together on it. It\u2019s reasonable to tell him that you don\u2019t want to financially support a guy who does nothing but play video games, but I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s necessarily what he\u2019s asking for. You\u2019re getting YTA votes because you\u2019re not communicating with him in good faith. \n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re stressed out at your job and I\u2019m willing to rework this, but I\u2019m afraid that everything is going to fall on me\u201d is MILES away from \u201cI\u2019ll lose all respect for you.\u201d Sit down for a long talk about values, concerns, financials, stressors, retirement, plans, etc. Don\u2019t make it an ultimatum about basic human respect.", "ESH. You because you don\u2019t support him ride or die. Him for thinking his woman would wear the pants and still respect him.", "NTA.\n\nit is kind of weird how once you ended up making six figures he automatically says that he won't need a job anymore, sure he might want to do his art but you can still do both. you should not have to financially provide for both of you just because you are starting to make more money.", "YTA\n\nRespecting your husband should not be based on whether or not they have a job. He has a dream of being an artist and if there is a chance you could support him in that than why wouldn't you? If the roles were reversed would you be happy if he denied you your dream? I'm not saying it would be OK for him to sit around and do nothing all day but somone working towards making their dream a reality is definitely someone worthy of respect.", "Soft YTA. This sounds like a sexist point of view. Is it because he's a man? I'm the breadwinner in my marriage and I have never once thought less of my husband.", "If he\u2019s not helping much around the house (as you mentioned) then why should he get to stop working? NTA", "NTA, but - if you would be OK with him going half time, tell him so. Agree on how much - eg 25 hours per week. Without adding to his chores if he is actually going to get art work done!\n\nAnd work with him on establishing milestones - so many art pieces completed, so many art shows attended to get visibility, pieces listed for sale, art classes taken - that kind of thing. So you know he is actually working on it.", "You\u2019re NTA for how you feel, and while I think your delivery was abrupt, he did not present this scenario to you as something he wanted to discuss, he just told you he plans to quit working. \n\nMaybe he was trying to soft-launch the idea with you that he be able to make that shift, and I think this warrants more conversation between you two, but you\u2019re right, he doesn\u2019t get to make the decision to just quit unilaterally. \n\nHave a bit of a think about what would make sense for your family, where you want to be long-term, and where his aspirations can fall into that. \n\nIt\u2019s possible to make a living with your art, but you need to get on the same page about a plan, how that looks, and what you\u2019re willing to do to support his interests. And where he would contribute to the family outside of financially.", "ESH, you nearly got nta but the way you phrased it was unnecessary.  If he wanted to change the dynamic and give up paid work he shouldn't have tried to ambush you with it.  I would suggest you sit down and try and have an adult conversation.  Maybe he could drop a day or two,  take over more of the house/child care and paint while the children are at school", "NTA for expecting your husband to still be working and being a financial provider despite your 6 figure income. \n\nYTA for telling him he would lose your respect if this is the first time having this conversation and thats your immediate first response.", "YTA. Couples usually handle these situations by having adult discussions about it. It\u2019s not cool that he made the assumption he could completely stop working, but why are you treating him like a leech? You should\u2019ve had an actual conversation with him about it instead of saying something so extreme. You said yourself he\u2019s always wanted to make his art full time, it\u2019s not like he saw this as his ticket to sit on the couch and play video games all day. Sit down with him, go over your finances together, see if it\u2019s even possible for him to work less and still maintain your standard of living. Like just TALK about it like grown ups??", "My cousin doesn\u2019t have kids and he doesn\u2019t work cause she makes mega bucks. He takes care of the house, etc.  works for them.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA. It\u2019s hard to know from the post how serious he was about the idea, but as it was just one comment, I think it\u2019s pretty understandable for him to daydream about quitting his job to pursue his passion, or even possibly to joke about it to defray the possible awkwardness of being substantially out-earned by his wife (not that I think that ought to be embarrassing, of course). Unless you know for sure he was dead-serious, you came down pretty hard on him. It\u2019s okay to clarify that you wouldn\u2019t be down for this and you want to make sure you\u2019re on the same page, but in saying that you would lose respect for him, you actually (possibly unintentionally, possibly not) told him that your respect for him is dependent on his *paid* work, which implies you may have already lost respect for him because he contributes less than you financially. It was unnecessarily harsh when a simple statement that you wouldn\u2019t be on board with that would have sufficed.", "NTA.  If it were me, he'd be losing a lot more than my respect, he'd be losing me as a partner.  He sounds like he thinks he's got a sugar momma.", "It\u2019s not the message, it\u2019s the way you delivered it. You already lack respect for your husband. If you didn\u2019t you wouldn\u2019t talk down to him that way.\n\n\nYta\n\n\n\nI hope he gets to throw those words back in your face someday.", "NTA\n\nIt would be a different story if he had come to you with a conversation about this rather than just assuming that now that you are doing so well financially he can stop working. He should not just be expecting this of you. It should have been broached as a \u201choney, you have become so successful and I would really like to be able to spend more time in my art, is there a way we could make it work with our family that I don\u2019t work as much anymore or at all?\u201d Then you can get into the logistics of how to balance work around the house because, yes, if he\u2019s not working or providing child care, he should be doing more around the house. That\u2019s not patriarchal it\u2019s just contributions to the household. Currently his contribution is working full time. It\u2019s completely reasonable that if you are working full time and he\u2019s not working he should take on more of the household maintenance and management. \n\nThat being said I think you should have more of a conversation about this to tell him where you are coming from and why you feel the way you do about it, rather than just telling him you wouldn\u2019t have any respect for him if he stopped working.", "YTA for how you said that. \n\n  \nTalk to your partner, and figure something out.  \nMaybe you did that 50/50 thing a lot time ago and it stuck, but things can change.  \nThat half time job sounds a good idea, but be sure about what you expect about the relationship, what you are willing to offer and what you aren't willing to do about all this. In mi personal opinion, I'd ask him to make good savings before moving careers or something. Good luck!", "NTA.\n\nHaving one person support both of you is a two yes one no discussion.

She agreed that she could work part time, but that money had to fund her art stuff.   \nThis way they are not going into debt to fund something that might not work out.

I have a great job now, but that could change.  If there is only one working individual, job loss is crippling and takes away your health insurance (COBRA is crazy expensive).

If he can't or won't do so in that time, then he returns to work.  It gives him a chance to transition into a career that feeds his passions, without letting him just leech.

Of course the person who is home more- regardless of income- should pick up more of the chores and child care, that's just common sense. The reason people like \"the good old days\" is because on person worked and came home to a lovely home and little chores, and the other person was able to raise the children and tend the home without worrying about also having a job. What sucked about the \"good old days\" was that the division of labor and income was based on gender. \n\nSo, totally cool if you end up deciding your husband can ditch the job, IF you have a nice safety net and he takes over most of the child care (after school) and chores. If he just wants to quit his job and do his art while you still do the majority of stuff at home and bring in the income, and you don't have a solid safety net, well then that's not gonna work.", "Hard to say, if he was making the money and you wanted to do art, people would be encouraging you and berating him for not wanting to support your dream.  \n\nIts a tough double-standard to negotiate.", "Alternatively, he could work part time but enough to pay for help with the cleaning, shopping, and maybe even cooking.

Mind you, this took almost everything to make this possible. I was making about 80k at this time. Again, I never once threw it in her face that she was not contributing. We are a team. \n\n Our daughter graduated and went off to college. We sold one house and moved into our cute tiny house. I found a new job in our new town. We ended up really liking it out here. My wife was full swing in her career and making lots of money. So we bought our dream property.  It's mostly my dream property. She loves it but would never want this much land. She supported it because she knew I loved it. \n\nMy wife's schedule is kind of crazy.  Some days, she works a lot. Sometimes, she is off on a weekday. Sometimes, she is done by noon. She gets 8 weeks of vacation. So for us, it was an easy decision for me to stop working my 7am-6pm job. We love how many bonus days we get. Days that wouldn't exist if she felt the way you do.  Now I will add that I am not lazy. I just can't be. So I do ALL of the housework. I love to cook, I do all of the cleaning and shopping.  I actually enjoy it. I did it for so long when I was a single dad before my wife adopted our daughter.  I enjoy taking care of the property and trails. I love our lives.

But there are ways to work hard at things and contribute without it being in a job. He could make and sell a lot of art. He could do a lot of volunteer work. He could run for an office.

It is likely to take a long time to build up a career in art (if he even gets it remotely off the ground in the first place), so keeping his foot in work will also be a wise back up plan.

Reason i say this is that you saying you would lose all respect for him if he stopped working is going to hit just as hard - how would you feel if your husband said that to you?

Figure out some possible solutions.  \n\nYour husband has a dream of making his art a full time, money-making gig.  Ok, build on that.  Talk through what that would look like - what's involved in making that happen?  Rather than a nebulous dream, put some framework around it.  What are the activities involved in turning a hobby into a paying job?  And talk about a time frame - how long is reasonable to try to make this generate some income?    Then consider other things like rather than quitting work entirely, can he step back to part time work while he tries to make a go of his art?  That's an approach a lot of people take - they go to part time to continue to earn some money and keep a toe in the water while they try to make their dream work.  Or maybe he can take up more of the responsibilities at home to offset your work outside the home - if you have less home responsibilities, then you can focus more on your career and perhaps advance more quickly.  It could be a win-win.  Talk about the finances - of course.  What would your budget look like on only your income?  What lifestyle choices would you have to make?  Can you still fund your retirement?  College funds for the kids?  How's your emergency fund?  If your finances aren't where you'd like right now, can you work toward something that you'd be comfortable with over the next 6 months?

If not then that is one goal that must be met before he can consider quitting. \n\nSecond his art.  If he has been doing it for 10 years and sold nothing what is his actual action plan to make money from it?  Has he had any successful artists or critics review and critique his work?  Is he truly good at art or is it that he wants to be but changes nothing to get to that point?

In my view, if I felt like something my wife did would cause me to lose respect for her, I would try to address the behavior or activity without saying directly, \"I'd lose respect for you if you did X.\" To me, that's a recipe for building resentment, breaking trust, and damaging your relationship.\n\nI *would* say something like, \"This thing you want to do has me concerned for XYZ reasons, and I'm not comfortable with it.

Anyways, another consideration is how much his discontent with his employment affects his relationships with you and your children.

The way you phrased it made it sound like you think he is a child that doesn't deserve respect. Ask what his plans are. Does he want to do his art full time? Is he willing to do more house work? Is part time a reasonable compromise? Can you actually afford it? There are lots of questions that you should have talked about before saying no.", "Going against the grain here and saying yta for saying you'd lose respect for your husband if he didn't work. There may come a time when he can't. Then what? And what if he was making enough to support you and you wanted to stay home for awhile working on a passion? If you're veiwing this as \"he's a man he should be working\" that's very old fashioned, many men are the sahp now. If you can afford for him to quit and concentrate on his art I'm sure he'd love it. He may be able to make money off of it if he's able to actually work on it full time. There is absolutely nothing wrong with men staying home, he wouldn't really be just staying home tho, he'd be changing jobs. It just may take a bit to start making money, just like anyone that starts a business. Would you be supportive if he wanted to quit and start a business? Because if he's wanting to work on his art that's essentially what he's wanting to do, as for making money there's no guarantee a new business is going to make money either.

He didn't say he wasn't going to be working or have any ambition.  You say he's always done art on the side but never made money at it.  Maybe that's because he hasn't been able to devote enough time to it to be successful at it.  Why not try a compromise?  He picks up a few more chores around the house for one while he works on turning a profit from his art.  Give him a chance.  He might surprise you.\n\nIf he's a truly artistic, creative person stuck working in a suit and tie office job, he's burned out.  He needs to explore his creative side.

Making your husband work 40+ hrs a week for the rest of his life even though you guys don\u2019t need the income because you have this idea \u201ca man should work\u201d is sexist and toxic. \n\nBtw, I\u2019m not suggesting that you should agree to him quitting his job- that is definitely a joint decision that will rely on a variety of factors and it\u2019s for the two of you two to discuss/decide. But your current reasoning of \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to provide for a grown man\u201d (he\u2019s your husband) and \u201cI\u2019ll lose respect for him\u201d (why?) is gross.", "ESH. You and your hubby were A Hs to each other in communication. As with many aspects of a relationship, things change. What is important is to communicate with each other and reach an agreement.\n\nHe is at fault for assuming you would take on all of the breadwinning duties and bringing it up in the way he did. Even if you make enough, his earnings could still benefit your family and this should be calculated. \n\nYou seem to hold some traditional views regarding gender roles and immediately jumped to not respecting your partner if they don't work. You said yourself he has a hobby/potential side business and could start doing duties around the house. And also suggested the part-time work. But instead of suggesting these to your hubby for discussion, you doubled with patriarchy. Men are not inherent providers. \n\nYou two need to have a conversation.", "ESH there's a pretty clear lack of communication. I do think if the genders were reversed there'd be a lot more people saying YTA though", "INFO: Do you even like your husband? You\u2019ve referred to your money and his money and your dreams and his dreams and your time and his time. What about the \u201cus\u201d factor? \n\nI think YTA not for not agreeing with the arrangement, but for not taking your husband or your partnership seriously. Sounds like this marriage is a financial or logistical arrangement to you. I would love the opportunity to talk to my partner about how we could better support his personal passions. Doesn\u2019t mean he needs to completely stay home, but your response must\u2019ve been crushing for him to hear.", "ESH but you suck more. The phrase \u201cif you stop working, I will lose respect for you\u201d really stands out to me as why. A person\u2019s worth isn\u2019t based on their working status, and, if that\u2019s how you see your relationship, you probably shouldn\u2019t be in one. Now, he should never have assumed he could stop working to pursue his art without discussing it with you. That\u2019s what makes him the AH in this situation. He still didn\u2019t deserve the absolutely devastating response you gave. A better response would\u2019ve been to discuss the situation and your feelings about it with him to reach an actual understanding. How you\u2019ve been in a relationship for 10 years without learning that is a little disheartening.", "NTA. This shouldn't be a unilateral decision. Also, what have you saved? Are you saving for retirement, for college, emergency fund. Just because your pay recently skyrocketed doesn't mean you're in a place where he can \"retire\" indefinitely and you feel financially stable long term. Also with the economy the way it is, I'd be extra worried about relying on a single income if you didn't have to.", "I just want to add to this that there is a lot of grey area between \"not working\" and \"working full time at a soul sucking low wage job.\"  My husband earns a lot more than I do.  I cut my hours back to 34/week (i get full benefits as long as I am at or above 32).  I do four 8.5 hour days - and get an extra day off.  My sister's partner lost his job during COVID.  She makes a lot more than him.  He is going back to school full time and has a part-time internship that is bringing in just a little money (although he hasn't had that the entire duration).  This will allow him to eventually get a job that isn't soul-sucking and has better compensation.  I guess what I am saying is that there is a lot of middle ground, and neither partner seemed to even try to discuss it.", "This is a great answer. I do get that there\u2019s no need for a stay at home parent, hence the expectation that the husband should work. However, it\u2019s not that he wants to quit so he can be lazy and do nothing; he wants to do something fulfilling and productive in his free time. And I 100% know that if the genders were reversed, we would have heard a different response.\n\nWith that said, I do think that there are some things that could be done here to make the situation fairer to OP. One is that he should take all the housework, or he could work part-time to still make some income but have more time for his hobby.\n\nThe fact that OP didn\u2019t think about these things or another compromise once and just told him that she would lose respect for him just because he wants to do something he\u2019s passionate about says a lot about how much she cares about him.", "The retirement isn't the problem.\n\nWhatever inside him said a decision that big could be made without consulting his wife is the problem, and it's not limited to just this one thing.\n\nI'm happy for you.", "Deeply accurate. We make into the six figure range. I always thought that was an insane amount of money. And If we didn\u2019t have 4 kids maybe it would be. We rarely eat out or vacation. We drive older cars. We don\u2019t have help. But dang it, kids are expensive as hell. And actually we do contribute a lot to retirement.", "I agree with this. My problem with his behaviour isn't him wanting to quit to try making it as an artist. My problem is the way he approached her about it. This should have been a discussion, not \"I'm quitting now, because you can support us both!\"", "Addressing your edit: Making organic sales that have *any* kind of significance (\"organic\" meaning you literally just released the art for sale, and didn't do anything else) is ridiculously rare in modern society where consumers are being constantly bombarded with products to buy, and have less and less spending money. You basically *have* to put time and money into marketing if you don't want to be screaming into the void.\n\nMarketing, as someone who has a degree in it, is a *long* fucking process. There's a lot of work you have to do before you even come up with the marketing plan, then you have to actually make the ads (by yourself, if you're an artist trying to make a go of it - companies hire *hundreds* of people just to do the stuff an artist has to do *alone*), then you have to *constantly* monitor the ads and tweak them to make sure they're as successful as they can be.\n\nIt is very difficult to do all of this while *also* holding a full-time job. That is why many artists quit *before* they're actually making a significant income - they just don't have time to do both. \n\nI don't think you truly understand how this stuff works. It's nowhere near as simple as \"if it was going to be profitable, it would have sold already\". That's not how it works. You know pretty much every single successful artist ever has had *decades* of failure before they sold *anything*, right?", "One of my exes basically wanted to be a stay at home gamer. I was all, so what happens if I lose my job or become unable to work? No backup? Hell no.", "Have you ever thought about how insanely capitalist this kind of thinking is?", "I feel like the asking if he understood was because he went quiet and she wanted to make sure there was no room for misunderstanding or him quitting his job to present her with a fait accompli and then claiming he thought she just said that she wouldn't respect him, not that she wouldn't still do it without respecting him.", "Retirement and COLLEGE. There\u2019s no way she can afford to support the whole family, put money away for retirement, AND fund college accounts by herself. That\u2019s insane.", "Yeah I agree. It seems we've evolved a lot as a society in terms of gender equality and getting women into the workplace, feeling that they have a choice between a career or being a stay-at-home mother. (This doesn't mean we're doing a good job of realizing that a lot of women are sadly being expected to do both) But it doesn't seem like there's been much acceptance for men who decide to be a stay-at-home dad. I don't at all agree with the way the husband went about things, and I don't think the wife is TA, but I also think a lot of people are downplaying the comment that she would lose respect for him and I do find that to be pretty insulting. Whether or not it was intended, implying that a man's worth and respect is in his job and income is a low blow, and I'm surprised to see how many people didn't have a problem with it.", "A person, irrelevant of gender, telling their partner: well Ill be quitting my job soon so you can support me financially, deserves a quick and concise shut down of that line of thought.\n\nHad he approached it differently ops reaction would have been harsh. But in this case it was deserved", "Yeah, my wife hasn't been able to work for 4 years now and I'm in the same ballpark as OP in the \"barely breaking\" 6 figure area. Providing for her plus our 4 dogs (they pre-dated her not working) with just my income is not exactly cushy.", "Yes, san fran, New York, la, even Boston are INSANE as far as living expenses go", "I think the comment about work and respect is read correctly \n\nIf the genders were reversed, I think this sub would have harsher judgement against OP\n\nBut more than that, I think men's worth is still tied up in the idea that they have to be providers and have a good career to be a \"proper man.\" It sounds like OP's husband doesn't desire that, and may struggle with societies expectations of his career vs. his own desires out of life. (We can't know how much he struggles with that, but I know as an American man myself, I struggle with my self worth being tied to my job/career.) If he does struggle, OP saying she would lose all respect for him definitely hurt. \n\nWhich is why I think the above commenter has it right. ESH because they're both making assumptions about their financial futures without discussing it with their partners, and that's not gonna work. And I agree, just because OP is making 6 figures, doesn't mean they even have enough to for her husband to stop working, but that's why they need to have these discussions.", "Agreed. I was especially worried about the medical angle -- what happens if she develops cancer? Is he going to stick around for her and start working again, somehow getting a job good enough to deal with crippling medical bills as well as their kids' college? I've seen relatives die of cancer, it's brutal and took years of expensive treatment.", "And he would, too if you let him OP. I\u2019m also the higher earner in my marriage and my husband -while having a respectable job- would leave in a heartbeat if I didn\u2019t object. It would mean double the pressure on you and honestly it\u2019s not fair. If he was an artist and you had married him as that it would be different, but suddenly deciding to pursue what is currently a hobby with the assumption that you would be the sole provider is not fair to you. Do not back off on this.", "At the very least start either looking for a job that isn't soul crushing it go back to school to get a masters or doctorate in something you are passionate about", "Right? A full time job and kids doesn't leave a lot of time to create. Depending on the medium and process a piece of art can take anywhere from 2-90+ hours to create. Also to get better you need to practise, which is even more time. Plus a tired person doesn't generally feel creative. OP isn't an asshole the partner is for springing this on them, but let's not forget art takes time and energy.", "My ex  (Thomas N Toner ))was a full time professor and head of the Art Department at St Louis University.  His oil painting were well thought of by many people, but he never made more from the sale of his paintinf=gs than he did as a Professor, and there was no predicting when his work would sell.  Is the woman's job enough to pay for everything, including health insurance and retirement savings?  kt", "Almost any household that is barely getting ahead today has both adults burning the candle at both ends. OP says as much when they say they'd want their partner to take on more household responsibilities if they went part time. OP is probably feeling burnt out, too, juggling kids, household, and an accelerating career.\n\nMaybe a compromise could be reached, if partner's job could support it? Partner can reduce their work time so that they have one day off a week when OP works and the kids are in school/daycare and partner has nothing to do but work on their art. No extra chores, no worries about the reduction in income (\"we're doing okay!\"). Whether that means creating something or networking or just walking around and getting some inspiration.\n\nI suggest this because I recently started a new work schedule that gives me an extra day off every 2 weeks. I work longer hours the other 9 days to get it, but I find myself EXTREMELY productive during that extra day off. Whether it's tackling an organizing task I've \"ugh, I'm too tired\"-ed at a million times or catching up on hobbies, it's been an incredible boost for me, mostly mentally!", "Indeed. The kids are \"school age\", but that certainly doesn't mean they're independent.", "Yeah, the best way for him to approach this would have been to ask her opinion and offer a smaller step. Maybe even something like both of them working full time for six months to a year to build up their savings and then him going to part time and doing art on the side.", "He didn't say that.  OP said that her partner \"made a comment recently...\" which sounds like something other than a formal declaration that he intended to quit and he taken care of.\n\n>..deserves a quick and concise shut down of that line of thought.\n\nCoercion is not how a healthy relationship should work out disagreements, especially with regards to money.\n\nThreatening to withhold your very *respect* for them if they don't do something you want them to do is just emotional manipulation.  especially as a **first response** to an off-handed comment.  Hence, Y T A.", "Link?", "We literally decided when to have kids based upon the payment schedule for student loans and daycare costs. It's crazy to me how the US can technically be one country, but worlds apart when you compare different areas.  I'm not suggesting we're poor (I've been poor, this isn't it) nor do I think people should feel sorry for us, because I know we are more fortunate than most.  However, as I explained to my husband, I never imagined I'd be contemplating houses that cost $750,000.  But if I had, it wouldn't have been a three bedroom, two bath ranch style from the 70's.  We did look at moving, but we have decent jobs, we have established healthcare, in particular for my child who has some relatively unique medical needs, and one child does not handle change well at all (Thanks, Covid) and in general, everything is a trade off.  For now, that means we stay put, but I'm seeing friends priced out slowly but surely and neighborhoods I wouldn't drive through at night when I was younger are now too expensive, so who knows what five years or ten years from now will bring.", "Are you an artist? No? Because we are MANY. And just because some can glip a switch and do both, it does not mean most artists can. In fact, most can't, which is where the starving artist persona comes from. Particularly considering how many neurodivergent artists there are (counting ADHD, dyslexia, etc) Our executive function is just not that good. Also... Most work is exhausting. If I lugged bags of flour all day, it may be easier to do art at night, bit most work requires brain power and in the end of the day yoy are fried.", "That's assuming he's a good enough artist.  We haven't seen his art.  Anyone who has watched even one tryout episode of American Idol knows how deluded people can be about their artistic abilities.", "This!
