Here is the thing - me and my sister live alone, our mom (48F) lives in the same city, but we do not see each other often. My boyfriend (21M) sometimes comes to sleep over when he has classes in the morning since he has to drive a long distance when he\u2019s at home (he lives in a small town) and everyone was fine with that. My sister got mad at me because of laundry one night and threw my clothes in the hallway and kicked my boyfriend out of our apartment (he did nothing wrong and was keeping quiet throughout me and my sister\u2019s argument.) Since then, I am not on speaking terms with my sister. My sister is known for being toxic, she is toxic towards our mom, me, and manipulates everyone into doing things for her since \u201cshe is pregnant\u201d. She is now 4 months pregnant and the belly isn\u2019t showing. That\u2019s the backstory.\n\nMy mom texted me yesterday and said when I was coming over. I said I didn\u2019t want to talk about our argument since it has nothing to do with my mom. My mom said I am to be present in my sister\u2019s life and help financially as much as I can. She is getting financial help from both mom dad, I make 330 euros working as a student. I said I barely make enough to support myself, and I cannot support the kid financially, my mom said I was toxic, I was not to ask for another cent from her and I will still help my sister out. I feel guilty not helping her out after our conversation, but I still don\u2019t think I want to help her financially. Am I the asshole for refusing to help?\n\nUpdate: I am so thankful for the response.

Water bills are usually the cheapest of the utilities for instance, around $50/month.  This should more than satisfy mom's demand to \"contribute\" and does not enable a selfish psychology in your sister, and it keeps a firm boundary between your money and her. \n\nIf this offer does not satisfy your mom, then she is out of line and you have every right to refuse.   The questions are then, What is threatened by mom when you refused to hand anything over to your sister?  Or when you say that you have nothing else left over after your expenses?  \n\nI can't tell from the way you describe your sister if she's being fairly described or if she's going through crazy pregnancy hormones.  The only comments I have on her are - not every pregnancy shows, and it sucks she kicked your bf out and it may have been unfair, but he doesn't have a right to the space.  It may be best to see him outside the house for the next few months to keep the peace, as she does get some leeway to control the comfort of the environment right now.
