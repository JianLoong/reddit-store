Why is it wrong that your sister eats leftovers instead of saving them for you when you didn't make the food in the first place? This doesn't make sense at all.

Your dad snapped at you for crying about missing lunch.  Great behavior?  No.  Not really enough for AH though.  We live in a society where you can contact each other.
