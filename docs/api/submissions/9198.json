I was looking for it since last night when my father said he will make it for lunch.

He responded:\" if you want to eat it then you should've wake up earlier\".\nA little note here my feeling is really really unstable when I just woke up. I felt so sad and hungry that I busted out crying. \nThen my dad got angry and tell me that it was my own fault that I missed the lunch and this is not the family's duty to put up with my schedule. I just keep crying and he keep yelling at me tell me to stop crying and he's not my servant or something. He said having a kid unstable like me make him want to die and I should just grow up and stop crying whenever something don't go my way.\nI don't know I just can't control my emotion and I just cant help but cry. \nMy sister said he's just feeling stress and I should ignore him, thing will be better. \nNow I feel really bad because I cried over something so small and it may make my dad feel more stress. \nAITA?\nI'm 15 and English is not my first language so the post may have some details that's not make sense, I think. Sorry about that.\nEdit: I'm sorry if the post is not clear because I don't know how to say it in English so I just use what I know.\nI don't blame my dad for not leaving food for me. I was crying because he always leave food for my sisters but never for me. So at that moment I just think that why he never save some for me but he did for my sisters. I want to speak it out but I can't because everytime I say something like that he will yell at me for being ridiculous. So words got trapped in my head, I don't know how to speak it out or expressing my emotion to him so I just cry.", "created_utc": 1675608005, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10udzrh/aita_for_crying_because_my_family_didnt_left_any/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was like this before and I've told him that I feel sad because he always leave food for my sisters but never for me.

Communicate is a great way but not for my dad.", ">  Who cries over food. \n\nHumans do?  \n\nThe lack of food and sharing of food is a basic human need.

I'm sad that I'm regularly treated less kindly than my siblings and I don't feel like I can ever have a reasonable conversation with my father. \n\nMost of the current comments: You're a spoiled fucking brat who deserves to have been yelled at. Feed yourself next time, you dramatic baby.\n\nI get that the information about being treated differently than their siblings came later, but a lot of the worst comments are *in response* to OP's clarifications.

Just because you CHOSE to nap, and he didn't save you food, doesn't mean he doesn't love you.", "Your emotions are not unstable. It's normal to cry when your feelings are hurt. It's NOT normal to yell at someone because they cry. Your father is emotionally abusing you. It sounds there is a golden child dynamic going on with your sister.

This problem is much bigger than lunch.", "I suggest you compose another post with details of this dynamic with your father in the past.

I'm saying that why he did for everyone else in my family but not me.", "Then why does everyone else get food saved?"]}
