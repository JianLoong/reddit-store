Also, I am using a throwaway since I don't want this bleeding over onto my personal page.\n\n\nAnyway, my sister has been living with me for close to a year along with her 6 year old son. She recently became homeless after what I'm gonna be nice and just call a 'series of bad choices' and since no one else would take her or her kid in, I decided to let them live with me until she can get back on her feet. Now I'm a reasonable person. I only have a few rules - mainly don't touch my shit. Just respect my personal space, and you're golden. That's not an unreasonable rule, right? Well, unfortunately, my sister just refuses to discipline her kid. Everyday, it's just constant tantrums and fits, and any attempt I make to set him straight gets my sister up in arms about how he 'can't help it'. But I try my best to bear with it because I know these two have literally nowhere else to go.\n\n\nRecently as well I finally built my own gaming PC after months of work and thousands of dollars spent, and I was beyond thrilled it came out so well! Of course, I immediately told my nephew not to touch it and that he is under no circumstances allowed near. He just about breaks everything else, so I don't think I'm being harsh here in saying I don't want him near it. I tell my sister as well to keep him away from it, but she just says I shouldn't 'bully' him. Cut to a few days ago, and he's throwing yet another tantrum because he wants to play Minecraft on my PC. I, of course, tell him no, but my sister is getting on my case about how it's not fair I get to be the only one to play it. I don't have the time to deal with this, I need to run errands, but I'm hoping in vain my sister can control him for once. The actual area with my PC set up is a open room with no door - think an office space but with figurines and such, so it's not like I can lock it off like I could do my room. Not even asking them to come with me worked since my sister just refused and my nephew screaming and crying certainly isn't I want to deal with when shopping.\n\n\nCome time I return, I immediately check to see if the PC is safe and what I find is broken glass everywhere, my moniters on the floor, and the PC tower practically in pieces. I'm beyond fuming now and confront my sister about what happened. She doesn't even try to hide it. She just says she let him on but couldn't figure out his to launch Minecraft, and when my nephew got mad he couldn't play, he had a meltdown. I, of course, demand she cover the costs to replace/repair, but she says it's MY fault for not letting him play and that she doesn't owe me anything. By this point, I had enough and packed up all the things and told both of them to get out or else I'm calling the police. She reluctantly left before snipping \"I hope you're happy,\" under her breath. Over the next few days, I'm bombarded with texts and voicemails from her calling me a bad brother and that it's my fault they're homeless.\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1672935673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10430f0/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_and_her_kid_out_of_my/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
