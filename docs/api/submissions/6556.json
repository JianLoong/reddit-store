Also, I am using a throwaway since I don't want this bleeding over onto my personal page.\n\n\nAnyway, my sister has been living with me for close to a year along with her 6 year old son. She recently became homeless after what I'm gonna be nice and just call a 'series of bad choices' and since no one else would take her or her kid in, I decided to let them live with me until she can get back on her feet. Now I'm a reasonable person. I only have a few rules - mainly don't touch my shit. Just respect my personal space, and you're golden. That's not an unreasonable rule, right? Well, unfortunately, my sister just refuses to discipline her kid. Everyday, it's just constant tantrums and fits, and any attempt I make to set him straight gets my sister up in arms about how he 'can't help it'. But I try my best to bear with it because I know these two have literally nowhere else to go.\n\n\nRecently as well I finally built my own gaming PC after months of work and thousands of dollars spent, and I was beyond thrilled it came out so well! Of course, I immediately told my nephew not to touch it and that he is under no circumstances allowed near. He just about breaks everything else, so I don't think I'm being harsh here in saying I don't want him near it. I tell my sister as well to keep him away from it, but she just says I shouldn't 'bully' him. Cut to a few days ago, and he's throwing yet another tantrum because he wants to play Minecraft on my PC. I, of course, tell him no, but my sister is getting on my case about how it's not fair I get to be the only one to play it. I don't have the time to deal with this, I need to run errands, but I'm hoping in vain my sister can control him for once. The actual area with my PC set up is a open room with no door - think an office space but with figurines and such, so it's not like I can lock it off like I could do my room. Not even asking them to come with me worked since my sister just refused and my nephew screaming and crying certainly isn't I want to deal with when shopping.\n\n\nCome time I return, I immediately check to see if the PC is safe and what I find is broken glass everywhere, my moniters on the floor, and the PC tower practically in pieces. I'm beyond fuming now and confront my sister about what happened. She doesn't even try to hide it. She just says she let him on but couldn't figure out his to launch Minecraft, and when my nephew got mad he couldn't play, he had a meltdown. I, of course, demand she cover the costs to replace/repair, but she says it's MY fault for not letting him play and that she doesn't owe me anything. By this point, I had enough and packed up all the things and told both of them to get out or else I'm calling the police. She reluctantly left before snipping \"I hope you're happy,\" under her breath. Over the next few days, I'm bombarded with texts and voicemails from her calling me a bad brother and that it's my fault they're homeless.\n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: wow! His blew up. To answer some frequently asked questions:\n\n\nI am not aware if my nephew is on the spectrum. My sister flatout refuses to get him tested, which is a whole different can of worms that would take forever to get into. \n\n\nAbout an hour or so after kicking them out, I called and offered to send directions to the nearest shelter. I don't want them being homeless but I sure as hell don't want them in my house either. \n\n\nPlenty of people asked why I had it built in the office at all and why I didn't keep the PC itself locked away. I had it all planned out long before those two moved in, its only recently that I was able to and unfortunately with all the money I had sunk in and time I spent planning, just holding off until they were out was not an option. Its such a pain to set up that keeping it locked away whenever I'm out would be way too much of a hassle.", "created_utc": 1672935673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10430f0/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_and_her_kid_out_of_my/", "score": 3211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For some who are ASD/ADHD being over stimulated can be physically painful for them.\n\nWhat OPs nephew did was a temper tantrum because when he couldn't get the computer that he was told he wasn't allowed to touch to work, he decided to lash out and break it because he doesn't know how to self regulate when told no, because his mother never tells him no or enforces consequences.\n\nSo yea, the only reason why OPs nephew \"can't help\" his temper tantrums is because his mother gives into his tantrums instead of actually dealing with his tantrums.", "I have a student that trashes my classroom pretty much any time she's not allowed to run out into the hallway and go crazy.  \n\nThough honestly I wouldn't call it a melt down, she's super clever and I think she's trying to get me away from the door :).", "Right...and his \"paranoia was clearly unfounded!

I thought that was the social norm, to act surprised no matter what.\n\nI also have struggles regulating tone, volume and feelings, but I definitely know a temper tantrum vs a meltdown. One is because I am upset or feel unjustly hurt or angry... Another is because everything is Just. Too. Much.\n\nAnd when things are \"just too much\" we learn quickly making it \"more\" is not a suitable way to get it to stop. The more we do is usually anything to make the thing stop.

A spoiled, undisciplined, extremely destructive SIX YEAR OLD (if he is even as bad as you describe him but for the sake of this argument lets just go with your description) shouldn't have the punishment of Homelessness because he fucked up.   6 god damn years old, but you guys just want to focus on the sister because it's much easier to condemn a grown woman.      Hell if his sister didn't have a kid and broke the PC herself, I'm sure I might be right along with the rest of you.      \n\nBut a kid doesn't get to choose his parent, and moms have a tendency to be overprotective of their only kids (obviously to a fault in this scenario).   \n\nI don't like the pushback I'm getting not because I dont think what's happened isn't an evictable offense.

Do not let your sister and feral nephew come back into your home again.", "NTA she was there because of bad choices and now she's not there because of bad choices", "NTA And I'm sure your sister can Google the location of the nearest homeless shelter. This is entirely her fault for refusing to parent her child.", "As op states, sister has gotten to where she is due to bad choices.", "There are so many people focused on whether this child had a disability or not, and I don't see any comments (as of yet) about mom potentially having a disability. The level of entitlement portrayed is not normal, her lack of care for her child (emotional neglect), is not acceptable. The fact that she just burned her last bridge, and due to \"poor decision making\"? I don't like to throw BPD around but that's what it sounds like, or something with similar symptoms and now her child and OP are a victims of it.\n\nOP, you are NTA. It sounds like your sister needs actual help. If she stays on this path, she could get kicked out of every shelter she's in (I've seem this behavior and it's results first hand), and potentially have her child taken away.", "Poor parenting considering the Mum let him in the PC and allowed him to have a meltdown because it wouldn\u2019t launch. And then blamed OP!\n\nKids not taught discipline would trash a Pc.", "Thank you! I hate it when everyone on here hears a kid is a brat and thinks oh it is gotta be autism. A lot of us got report card notes that said we were \u201ca pleasure to have, but cry too easily\u201d. And I mean just like crying cause of frustration or fear or bullying, not a terrible tantrum. NTA", "My 8 yr old nephew would throw this kind of fit.\n\nThe SIL would claim anger issues and adhd, while bro would claim he's a kid and it's to be expected.\n\nI know for a fact, because he broke my tablet, which I lent so he could do online schooling on the caveat that it would be fixed if broken AND it was treated with respect.\n\nWhen I was told it was broken: bro said to expect it because he's a kid and SIL said it wouldn't be worth fixing.\n\nMy new tablet that I never got to use.. that I was going to use for my hobby business, and was set back since I still don't have the $300 to replace the screen. Which they bitched to me about as ive \"been talking for a year\" about putting my hobby online to sell the pieces I make. But couldn't articulate why I couldn't do it, beyond i was researching the best way how.\n\n...sorry about the rant, it still bugs me to this day.\n\n\nAlso: OP you're NTA your sister made more poor choices, refuses to parent her kid, and you ended up having enough of your bratty nephew breaking things. Personally I'd text her and everyone complaining about the damage and the cost, asking who is taking them in and who is replacing your computer.", "I hate it so much on here when they do that. I am autistic and my nephew highly likely is. Despite being a toddler, when he comes over he just wants to spin his toys (like a top). He is easy af so long as he has something to spin. Sure he\u2019ll hit the wall and get overstimulated at bedtime, but that\u2019s all toddlers. He just wants to spin in peace.", "The sister might get her kid taken away. There is hope. But it's going to be a rough ride. Good luck to the little bugger.", "Yes! My nephew is on the spectrum. Even at 6, he would not have done this. Because parenting and boundaries. My goddaughter on the spectrum whose parents never tell her no because it might cause her to feel discomfort? Yeah, she\u2019d do this.\n\nOp- NTA.", "You\u2019re not an AH that\u2019s a funny store. My go to was if they were telling me make an excited face, open, and then thank profusely. Especially after my little sister told me on my birthday I got a suitcase (a very cool one for future trips). We were in the car and my mom just ignored us until I got home and opened it. She didn\u2019t wanna give it away.", "You mentioned you can lock the door to your room. Why didn't you put the PC in your room and lock the door? And sue her for damages. I hope you kept the receipts. And took pictures.", "NTA, honestly makes sense why she was homeless in the first place. The same thing probably happened everywhere else she stayed.", "Sooo much NTA. Wow. Mom needs to do her son a favor and start disciplining him. Enabling him to this level is going to fuck him over in life, and he\u2019s going to fuck everyone else over in life. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your PC, OP. I hope you\u2019re able to get a new one!", "NTA. Sue her over the damage. It was her responsibility to control and discipline her child and telling you that you have to hide you gaming pc is victim blaming.", "My child has autism and can have extreme meltdowns. He can get aggressive and violent   \n so I get meltdowns. This was a tantrum. \n\nCan we please stop blaming bad behaviour on autism. This just creates horrible stereotypes. My kid is calm and gentle 99.7% and the meltdown only happens when he is truly overwhelmed. But people treat him badly and exclude him due to stereotypes like this.", "If the kid has these outburst at 6 It means he has anger issues that need to be addressed. No wonder given the situations. Anyway for the future, the best way to handle these situation with kids is not by prohibition, but by teaching them what to do.", "NTA!  Whether her son is or isn\u2019t on the spectrum is irrelevant.  Whether or not you put a door and a lock on the room where your gaming system is located is irrelevant.  You invited her to stay with you and you told her that her son was not allowed to touch your gaming system.  It was up to her to ensure that her son didn\u2019t.  Instead, she not only allowed him near it but didn\u2019t stop his meltdown that ultimately destroyed your property.  None of this is on you and your sister made her decision to allow her child to destroy another\u2019s property and not accept responsibility to replace that property.  When People get themselves into situations, expect others to bail them out and then fail to appreciate and follow rules that are reasonable, then they need to be held accountable. Since she refuses to take accountability, then she has to accept the consequences.", "NTA and now you know why she has nowhere to go.", "NTA... Your sister is AWFUL. Do not let them back", "If I were OP, I'd sue her over this.", "Disability or not it\u2019s a parent\u2019s job to discipline their child. His mom is obviously failing him there because she couldn\u2019t respect the rules, actively let him on it when he wasn\u2019t supposed to be near the thing, and afterwards blamed OP for not giving into her son\u2019s demands. If that\u2019s her attitude now WTF is going to happen when he\u2019s older and decides to help himself to his uncle\u2019s car?", "Or he's 6 years old and doesn't listen to the word No.  \n\nGotta wonder what was wrong with the sister as she just watches and is unable to control his behavior.", "We are assuming that the kid did he destroying. Given the maturity of the mother, I wondered whether she \"helped\".", "A lot of modern gaming PC cases have glass side panels. OP even mentions glass shards everywhere. Once that's broken, the insides are pretty easy to damage by blunt force alone.\n\nSo she didn't only let her son destroy the expensive tech, she also didn't care about him possibly hurting himself throwing a tantrum while surrounded by broken glass.", "That's a good point. What kind of person will not only ignore their host's one big rule; but will allow their kid to destroy an expensive piece of that host's property and not even deign to clean it up or even apologize for it? This goes past laziness or apathy. It's like the sister has a lot of narcissism and/or hates OP.", "The judgement will still sit there until she does come into some money. That is assuming she is as broke as she claims she is.", "People in this subreddit see any kind of bad behaviour and start assuming that people has autism. Even if they had it that doesn't excuse them of the consequences of their actions.", "Because otherwise parents would have to own up that they are just crappy parents who haven\u2019t bothered to parent their children.  It\u2019s much easier to blame something else than accept responsibility for their child\u2019s behaviour. I recall an expression - children aren\u2019t born with bad behaviour, they learn it.", "Yep. They heard at one point a kid acting out may have something deeper and ran with it (all while combining their ableism).", "Or ADHD. So many things get blamed on ADHD here. Well no, sometimes, and I firmly believe MOST times, it's just bad parenting.\n\nAlso I want to add to OP: about your edit, people asking why you didn't lock your PC away are basically victim blaming. You should have been able to let things unattended in your own home. Your sister and nephew suck hard.", "She sure is a huge asshole to someone who provides her and her kid a place to live. I'm surprised you didn't take her to court. Cause no one is obligated to accept her shitshow. Block her number for a while imo.", "NTA Is it possible your sister joined your nephew in causing some of that damage?  Because if not it sounds like she certainly didn\u2019t do anything to stop him.", "NTA. Clearly your sister won't even bother to discipline her son.
