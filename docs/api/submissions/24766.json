I made up my mind to be there for Louis any way I could, and although I don\u2019t live close, I visited him every 6 weeks, even when I had just had my daughter, I check in with him daily, etc.\n\nTom met his fianc\u00e9 Ruby 8 months after Yas passed. Tom was lost without Yas, and he cut and pasted Ruby into his life quickly, and Louis hated it. Ruby came with three of her own kids, who moved into the house, suddenly Ruby was turning up at his school events and telling him what to do. Tom felt like it was an adjustment and that eventually Louis would let Ruby and her kids into his life. It never happened. \n\nIn the spring I started to get worried about Louis, so I convinced Tom to let him come and stay with me for the summer. When he arrived,  he just looked miserable and burnt out, but I was shocked how quickly he seemed to come back to life with a little time and fun. The only time he gets upset is when his dad or Ruby calls, or anyone mentions him going home. \n\nSix days ago, he sat me and my husband down and asked if we would consider letting him live with us. He said living with us is the only time he\u2019s felt happy since Yas. It just shattered my heart into a million pieces. We had a long talk with him, and a long talk with Tom, and Tom had a long talk with Louis. I think that was the first time in a long time that Tom actually heard how unhappy Louis is, and he\u2019s devastated. He said he would consider it, but I could see how hurt he was.\n\nThe night before last, I got a call from Ruby. She was howling down the phone that I am ruining Louis and Tom\u2019s relationship. She said that by offering Louis a way out I have basically made it impossible for them to bond. That I\u2019ve put them all in an impossible situation because if Tom says no Louis will hate him, and if Tom says yes Tom will resent her and her kids for being the reason Louis left. She said Louis had a chance to have a real family and that by taking him away just because it\u2019s hard, I\u2019m ruining that for him. She said I was a meddling b*tch out to steal Louis from the one parent he had left. I defended myself on the phone but once she hung up I cried. \n\nI just want what\u2019s best for Louis. When he arrived to stay with us, I didn\u2019t even know a child could look that old. Maybe my emotions made me cross a line. He already lost his mother, maybe he\u2019s too young to really know what it means to cut off his dad like this and I should have tried harder to make him see that, or not given him a way out. \n\nMy parents and husband think we\u2019re doing the right thing but a couple of friends I\u2019ve spoken to have said that while families are hard, Louis might regret leaving his dad later in life when he grows up and they don\u2019t have a bond. I know this is complex but I guess I\u2019m just wanting some perspective from people who aren\u2019t as emotionally plugged into this as I am.

Jesus Christ this is the obvious answer, RUBY is the fucking problem here!!! I understand losing a spouse is soul crushing, but Louis lost his mom too at such a young age. Never in a million years could I imagine being so heartbroken over my spouse\u2019s demise that I would jeopardize hurting my child so badly or losing my relationship with them. Imo it\u2019s disgusting.", "NTA - your nephew approached you, not the other way around. If you hadn\u2019t told Tom what had happened and your ability to help then it would be a different story. Additionally, Tom had seriously let his relationship slide with his son himself and that\u2019s not on you.", "NTA. Louis brought it up, not you, and you did the right thing by talking to Tom about it. It sounds possible that Ruby either knew this was an issue, or she didn't but now feels like she should have, and resents that you actually addressed it when she knows she or Tom should have. No matter what happens I hope someone looks into therapy or something to help Louis deal with all these changes in his life, it's hard for kids who feel they have to pretend to be okay when they aren't for the sake of the adults. I'm glad he has you and your husband as a safe space.", "NTA\n\nRuby sounds like the wicked stepmother from hell. \n\nThe kid lost him mum less than a year ago, yet she expects him to move on and accept her bossing him around. F that!\n\nYou are a shining light in Louis life, and it's great that he has you in his corner. \n\nIf Tom is really serious about putting Louis first, he would agree to let him stay with you because a child's mental health comes before an adults ego. He would then move heaven and earth to ensure the situation at home improves to a degree that Louis then feels comfortable moving back home. \n\nPlease don't let the harpy make you feel bad. All kids NEED a safe person they can be honest with. Be honoured you are that person.", "NTA - you were the first adult in ages that actually listened to Louis.  His dad and \"instant forced family\" definitely weren't listening.  Hoping that his dad will do what is best for his son.  Either have an ex-fiance, or let Louis life with you and your husband.", "NTA.\n\nThe situation at the moment is not one where Louis can be who he is. He will not bond with them if he is forced to. \n\nIt is a nice thing, you offer him to stay with you. I would also recomend that he should start therapy. Maybe also with his dad - if you live far away, maybe just a few times a year. So the can reconect. But it seems to be the best for him to get out of the situation at the moment. To regenerate and get the energy and support he might still need after his mother's death.", "NTA you offered for him to come for the summer so you could bond more with him and not have to take a weekend every six weeks to see him. He asked you cause he feels loved and wanted there. He can still have a relationship with his father. Yes he hasn\u2019t talked much to him over the summer but that\u2019s because sometimes people need space", "NTA. Louis came to you.  You and your home are a safe haven for him, and he\u2019s apparently thrived and wants to stay.  It\u2019s not the end of his and his dads relationship, maybe he\u2019ll move back later who knows, and if not, he is still his dad.   What\u2019s important right now is that Louis is unhappy at his dads house, and asked you if he could stay there.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like an amazing aunt who I would if my kid was so upset at home would happily allow them to stay at.\n\nThat said I think its important to understand who are his guardians still. Try and get frequent visits otherwise its easy for 2 parents looking after 3 kids already to forget about the 4th. They need to see him at least once a month if not more.\n\nRubys' actions are just coming from a place of neglect. She is likely trying but Louis isn't receiving it well or something else.", "Nta ask ruby just how was before you offered any better? The kid was miserable.", "NTA, Tom made a not uncommon mistake of bringing Ruby in too quickly. Louis is at an age where his opinion does matter. Based on the info you\u2019ve given, I would stand up and defend Louie\u2019s choice. Maybe look into therapy for Louie if that\u2019s an option. (And eventually the therapist might suggest including Tom in some sessions) Poor kid. I hope he starts to heal.", "Don\u2019t listen to friends who are hung up on what might be instead of what is happening right now. The way the words \u201ca way out\u201d were used implies that Ruby knows the kid feels miserable and I guess, trapped. You are in no way in the wrong here. I hope he gets to stay with you where he will be happy. NTA", "NTA and the bond stuff is BS because they've had 11 years to bond, they're not bonding now and he could bond better with his replacement family. \n\nA toxic family environment destroys.bonding opportunities. His dad could see him away from his new wife and they'd probably bond better, but if he doesn't want to make the fatherly effort.\n\nIt has me wondering if an 11 year-old child can himself initiate a custody change.", "NTA\n\n> That I\u2019ve put them all in an impossible situation because if Tom says no Louis will hate him, and if Tom says yes Tom will resent her and her kids for being the reason Louis left.\n\n***SHE IS THE REASON***.  \n\nShe just doesn't want Tom to resent her for it.  \n\nNote how everything is about her.\n\nI'm amazed Tom let it go this far and is acting surprised.", "NTA at all. Louis sat you both down. Louis was miserable and burnt out. Louis finally felt some happiness. You have helped him and are offering to continue helping him, because that\u2019s what Louis wants. \n\nYou\u2019re a great aunt", "Definitely NTA for offering but I do think you need to do this in a way that works for everyone and maintain his connection to his father. \n\nOffer for it to be a trial run for the fall semester with Louis visiting home on the same frequency you were visiting him (more if Tom comes to you). \n\nEncourage therapy both for Louis and for them as a family. Hopefully Ruby can learn to back off a little and build a relationship with Louis on his terms.", "INFO: how long has it been since Yas passed? How long has it been since Ruby started living with Tom?", "NTA.\n\nFirstly, you should definitely have a constructive conversation with Tom about Ruby's behaviour. Don't attack them. Just lay out the facts of what was said in the phone call.\n\nSecondly, Louis lost his mom. And not long after that, he was forced to live with 4 strangers in his own home. It's important that Tom open his eyes and recognise the position he placed his son in. Even if it's hurtful.", "NTA at all\n\nBlending a family is dicey and difficult thing. If Louis is having the problems he\u2019s having then Tom is not navigating or handling that change properly. He\u2019s probably being neglected and railroaded in his own home.\n\nRuby calling and blowing up, blaming YOU for Louis wanting to leave should tell you everything you need to know about the situation. If it really were about family and bonding she\u2019d be asking how to fix the situation to make it suitable for Louis. It\u2019s probably all about appearances for her. Or all about her children.", "NTA \n\nAnd don't take any more calls from the GF. The only people you are in negotiations with are your nephew and your BIL. He deals with his gf. If anyone is ruining anything it's the two of them, by not giving your nephew the time, space and support to process what has happened and what is happening.\n\nTell BIL you will only discuss the situation with him, abs hang up if she calls. And also contact a family law practice. If at any point your BIL says 'yes' you want to have all your ducks in a row so you can quickly and legally step in to be his guardian.", "NTA. I disagree that you're giving your nephew an easy way out.  He's making this request because his current family is not working for him.  I predict that the next step for him will be to run away from home every time chance that he gets.\n\nOn the plus side, you would be helping him find some stability in his life. What is more, you'd be helping him to create his found families because his biological family is toxic to him. Stick by your offer.  But insist that a condition of his living with you is that he and his dad spend quality time together.", "Please, give us an update about this. This is so sad. I think Ruby has to live in another house with her kids and Louis with his Dad, instead of Louis leaving his Dad. But if that doesn't happen and he is not happy, he needs to be out of there before he hits puberty and he will seek for other ways to cope with his feelings.", "NTA.  Ruby is in denial.  She and her kids have had ***four years*** to try and bond with Louis in order to form a \"family\".  If it hasn't happened in four years, ***it isn't going to happen at all.***  I wonder if Ruby has been trying to \"erase\" Yas from Louis' life.", "NAH - EDIT: NAH except Ruby for her rude phone call. \n\nYou all are in a tough situation. It\u2019s obviously Louise is hurting. The question, to me, is he hurting because of his living arrangement, the lose of his mother or his dad moving on too soon? These three situations are incredibly tough on their own let alone for a eleven year old. Putting them together creates an impossible road to navigate. In my opinion, pulling him out of the situation is only a temporary fix. \n\nI think it\u2019s time to get Louise some professional help and family therapy for father and son. \n\nIn the meantime you could offer giving Louise a break from time to time by letting him stay with you for a couple of days.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Please save Louis!!!", "NTA, this isn't my story to tell but something similar happened to someone close to me while they were just a kid, and at the time they knew that living with their relative would be better but they decided to stay with their parent, for reasons that I won't tell. What I should say is that they regret not making a different decision, their relationship with their parent and step parent only got worse. Because of that as soon as possible they literally crossed the country to stay as far away as possible and went NC, only now after years they are thinking in the pssoibility of going LC with their parent and just because  the parent got divorced from step parent. Ur nephew moving with u, might be what saves his relationship with his father. Talk to Tom ask if he would like to walk in the same shoes as my friend's parent did, not be invited to his son's wedding, lose the birth of his grandkids, lose his graduation... and the list goes on.", "Absolutely NTA it would seem like there is more to the story and the new wife.

If Louis went back, how long do you think it would take before he calls you, or worse hurts himself?", "NTA because the child came to you.", "NTA. Id even go as far as to say you are the only non asshole in this kids life. Your BIL and his wife absolutely do not care about this boy, his grief, his mental health. He\u2019s willing to let his son go rather than pause this relationship and help him through his grief. 11 years old is old enough to know he\u2019s miserable, to feel himself drowning. The way you described him when he arrived is extremely concerning and you wouldn\u2019t be a very good aunt if you didn\u2019t try to address it in some way. You are a representation of his mother and her side of the family which sounds like what he desperately needs right now and that should be the focus for all involved.", "NTA. If Louis regrets this choice later in life, that's something he can deal with then. He can't keep living in misery just incase he might have regrets later on. Ruby sounds awful. She clearly wants the perfect blended family and it just isn't happening. She is putting everyone else's needs over Louis'. He's a kid, his parental figures are supposed to be looking out for him and they're not. I hope he ends up moving in with you and gets the life he needs.", "Nta.

In reality I think he made that decision some time ago otherwise he would have known and checked in on his child's feelings.", "NTA, but you should let Tom know about Ruby's call.  It sounds like maybe Tom is having some serious second thoughts about their relationship due to the real chance of losing his son.  Maybe, just maybe his eyes are starting to open to the damage being done, and realizing he's been in the wrong about not stopping Ruby's behavior.  Either that or like someone else said, she just found out the house she has been living in belongs to your nephew not his father, and if he's not living there she may have to move out.  Either way, you're doing right by your nephew.  I hope Tom lets him stay with you, and remains active in his son's life until he gets the mess he created at home sorted out.", "NTA.  Let's be honest if Louis was a priority in this family, they never would have allowed him to stay with you for an entire summer with barely any contact.  \n\nI live out of state from my extended family.   I have allowed my children to go visit without me for short periods of time.   10 days max.

I would understand if there was. 8 months seems way too soon even without a kid. \n\nAs I\u2019ve said, in my opinion, taking Louise out of the situation will only be a short lived solution.

Blended families don't always happen like The Brady Bunch, and Ruby and Tom need to wise up to the fact that if Louis hasn't felt some semblance of a bond to Ruby or her kids by now, it's not likely to happen (imo, though I'm not a psychologist or any sort of professional, just from my own experience and discussing similar issues with others.)\n\nWhatever you do, keep being there for Louis. Offer him that space in your home, even if it'd for holidays or school breaks and summer vacations. Having that time to be away from the stress may be what he needs. Figure out a good schedule where he can still visit whomever he doesn't live with, to help foster the bond with his dad (but Tom needs to know that the bond or lack thereof is not due to Ruby/her kids, necessarily, but rather his choice to not focus any of his energy on his son.)", "Perhaps a good compromise would be for him to live with you but visit his dad in the holidays then the maximum time is spent with you and he doesn\u2019t lose that connection with his dad. \nWorth thinking about for sure.", "NTA.

The older Louis gets, the less likely it is he'll ever see Ruby and hers as anything to do with him, especially if Ruby thinks she's *entitled* to that from him.\n\nPeople are confusing you by talking about this as a black and white situation. It's not 'take Louis in and permanently separate him from his father'. There are any number of arrangements you could propose. Perhaps you will all formally agree on times when you will get together and re-evaluate the arrangement to see if Louis is ready to try living with his father again. Perhaps living with you will be conditional on Louis still spending *some* period of time with Tom. You can set up a trial arrangement. It's disingenuous for anyone to pitch this as anything when there's no firm plan on the table yet!\n\nWhat this could give Tom and Louis, if Tom is willing to accept, is an opportunity to have some space and a lifting of pressure. It *might* be easier for Louis to connect with Tom and Ruby and the stepsiblings if he knows he only has to tolerate that situation for a short period of time.\n\nWhat's clear right now is that what's happening at home for Louis isn't working.

My needs took a backseat Because my responsibility as the parent of a minor child took priority over my needs.  I dealt with my needs in my spare time.  I was very aware of when something was bothering my son, because I looked for changes in behavior. I read up on minor children losing their parent.\n\nTom is responsible for the health and well being of his bio child.  That is his responsibility.  He has apparently decided that he will also take on the responsibilities for the well being of his GFs children and try to have yet another child.  He did this IGNORING the needs of his own bio child.\n\nit is hard to know whether he was looking for a replacement mom for his child or an instant family so he and his son could forget their grief and loss, I don\u2019t know.  And that is for Tom To figure out.  But what I do know is that he through stupidity, or whatever neglected the needs of his own bio child.\n\nit was crystal clear to you within mins of your nephew arriving at your house.

Newsflash, it won\u2019t.\n\nRubie is out for Rubie and her kids.  As she should be because her kids are her kids.  She is trying to get pregnant because that will cement the relationship with Tom.

And when she called, she wasn\u2019t concerned about the nephew, she was concerned about herself and her kids.\n\nTom needs to do some soul searching and he needs therapy.  He is in a mess and he wants everyone to be happy, but that\u2019s not possible. He can\u2019t have his cake and eat it too.  He has choose who is his first priority.  Whose needs come before everyone else\u2019s desires.  If it\u2019s himself or Rubie, then he needs to let his son go and live with you, so that his son can heal and and have the life he deserves.  It\u2019s in his son\u2019s best interests.  If he want to prioritize his son\u2019s needs first, then he needs to sit down with a therapist and his son and listen to what his son needs.  And that will mean sending Rubie and her kids packing.\n\nNow, as Yas\u2019 stepsister, think about what she did with her estate. There were reasons she did what she did.  The house was in her name only even though they were married.  Her estate goes to the boy when he comes of age.  Her own husband was basically left with no house when His wife died because the house was in a trust.  So, Yas for whatever reasons did not trust her own husband to be a responsible steward of her assets.  You are thinking about the best interests of your nephew.  excellent, but you also need to look down the road to when your nephew is 18.  He gets his mother\u2019s house.  His father has brought a woman and her uncivilized children into the house and is actively trying to produce another child.  The house is small, so I am guessing that Tom does not make enough money to buy a bigger house to fit a family of 6, planning on 7\u2026 he can\u2019t sell Yas\u2019 house because he doesn\u2019t own it.  Who in their right mind would want to bring another child into the world when the house isn\u2019t big enough for the existing family??\n\nin my opinion, Tom has never looked out for his son\u2019s best interests, Yas did.  Yas left the house to her son to ensure that her son would have a place to live.  You have the child\u2019s best interests at heart.  That child needs someone in his corner supporting him.  That isn\u2019t his dad.  I guarantee you that if he goes back to his dad, they will wear him down right up to his 18th birthday to get him to sign the house over to his dad, his dad will see it to buy a bigger house for his brood, and your nephew will be left with nothing.\n\nnone of what Tom is doing is in the best interests of his own child. And it seems that Tom is conflicted now that he has been confronted with the facts that he can\u2019t run from\u2026 if he was stupid or ignoring it before, he can\u2019t ignore it now, and he still isn\u2019t acting in the best interests of his child.

There was some tension, my dad was never going to marry her because my mom was his soulmate.  But he enjoyed the girlfriend Very much.  The girlfriend decided that she wanted him to marry her, and he would use delaying tactics because he just wanted her to be his live In gf, whom he treated very well.  She finally decided the barrier to her success was my sibling.  She finally told my dad it was her or my sibling, but one had to go. In a heartbeat, he told her, honey you picked a fight you can\u2019t win Because I will never pick anyone at the expense of my children. She packed up and left the next day.  Because as much as he enjoyed and wanted her, his children came first and he would never put his own children out of his house.  I talked to him about it later Which is how I know the story.\n\nso while Tom may love his son, and may want the best for him.  Tom isn\u2019t willing to sacrifice for his son.

They do whatever it takes, instinctively and immediately.\n\nso Tom will never give his son the love and security that his son needs because he doesn\u2019t love him more than his own well being.  Your nephew needs to know he has someone there who will be his rock Because his mother was his rock and she is gone.  He needs to know that when he is desperate and feels he has no way out, he has one person he can call who will have his back no matter what, no delay, no needing time to think about it or balance other concerns.  Your nephew is in the shape he is in because he recognizes that you and your husband are on his side, you will put him first, he came come to you when he is ready to give up on life, and you will give him a hand to help him stand up.

It reminds me that there are people out there who are parents, but should have never had kids. We've seen lots of stories here where a man loses his wife during childbirth, and can't deal with the child after. Because they'd rather have their dead wife back. Some of them even hate the child because they are to blame for the wife's death. Nevermind that the husband had a hand in creating said child in the first place?\n\nThe fact is that some people are just terrible parents and in another life, they should never have had any. Tom is probably one of these people. He can't get his head out of his own ass to be a good parent to his only child because he's so broken from the death of his wife.

I think that she is trying to force it, rather than allowing it to happen naturally.  She and Tom are now in a Catch 22 because of the way they went about blending the family unit.  \n\nI tend to think everyone needs grace because it doesn't seem like anyone has done this before.  They are all trying their best.  It seems like Luis is suffering because it is happening in a way that is not meshing with his love language/emotional growth style.\n\nThis is 100% on the adults to recognize and to deal with, but it is also something that is a learning curve.  Neither marriage nor children come with manuals for how to deal with this type of situation.", "Thanks for the clarification. \u2018Legal\u2019 in legal guardian made me assume (wrongfully) some kind of court needs to officiate that.", "I think Louis is too young right now to decide who he lives with.

Too bad his father did not see it sooner or decided it was best for his son to tough it out and accept it.  By allowing his son to do this, he can come back and build a bridge with him without his new wife.  You are offering him that space.  If he was to stay in that house without any other options, he will leave at the first opportunity and I\u2019m guessing cut his father off for allowing his misery.

While there\u2019s definitely going to be some level of emotional immaturity there, 11 is definitely old enough  for a child to have an opinion about which parent or guardian they feel comfortable and safe living with, and that should be taken into account. What matters here is what is in the best interests of the child, and it sounds like his mental health was suffering with his father & step mother. It sounds like his dad has actually heard and understood how much his child is hurting, and I really hope he takes it on board and makes the best decision for his child, which right now sounds like it\u2019s staying with you. The stepmother has had over three years to bond with this child and it sounds like she and his dad have ruined it by expecting instant love rather than allowing the child to set the pace and role he would like his stepmum to be for him. It\u2019s not like Dad would never see the child ever again either. If he does come to live with you, it sounds like this child needs some sort of supportive counselling, and maybe you both could take guidance from that clinician about how to rebuild that bond with dad? This sounds so complex and it\u2019s natural that emotions are running high, good luck to you, I hope things resolve in the best interests of everyone involved.", "The \"dad\" is pathetic. That he can't pull himself together, fine, take some time, get some therapy.

She really has no say in the matter, and I hope Louis' dad sees the handwriting on the wall and is reasonable for his son's welfare.", "NTA.  The important part here is that Louis reached out to you first. He asked you about the possibility of him living with you. He is literally asking for help, this is good he is mature enough to recognize that he is not in a mentally healthy environment and is able to recognize there are people who he can go to for help. You cannot ignore this, do not let his father ignore this. Ruby has no say.\n\nYou did the right thing by talking to Tom and not promising Louis anything. Tom needed that sit down to face reality, Louis needed to understand that you need Tom's permission but also to see that he has people who support him.\n\nWhile Tom has the ball in his court, might I recommend a compromise. You want to repair Louis and Tom's relationship, so I would recommend that Louis live with you with frequent visits from Tom. Also have Louis see a therapist separately and with Tom. I think both father and son need grief counseling.\n\nWhile I feel like saying this to Tom might fall into the \" mind your own business\" area, it needs to be said. He needs to consider which is more important to him at this moment, his relationship with his son or relationship with Ruby and her kids. Rebuilding his relationship with Louis is going to take time, time that Ruby might be upset about him spending away from her. Louis is not ready to spend any time let alone build a relationship with Ruby. Tom might have to consider putting his relationship with Ruby on pause, and possibly consider that she is not the right person. He needs to think about her behavior as well. If she is showing him that she doesn't support his relationship with Louis being a top priority is this a person he wants around Louis? Because that means his son is not a priority for her. He also might want to consider that keeping her around while sending Louis away will show Louis where he falls on importance in his father's life.", "NTA\n\nI would say that you should try to have him move in for his own mental health, but on the understanding that he spends a few weekends a month at his dad's and several weeks in the summer.

As it stands, it doesn't sound like it would take much for her to pressure Louis' dad to force OP to cancel these necessary sessions.", "First, I'll give Tom a little credit here. I may not agree with how he handled the hole Yas left in his and Louis' lives, but while his son moving out breaks his heart he immediately recognised the logic and how it was in his son's interests. Not all parents can do that and that deserves a shoutout.\n\nRuby is absolutely the worst person here. She'd rather maintain a false image of a happy family than actually do what's right for the mental health of an innocent, bereaved child. I've experienced a bad step parent but nothing as bad as this.\n\nAs for you, OP, you are an angel. You've made a broken child whole again.

As someone who went LC with my dad at a young age (with periods of NC), I absolutely do not regret it. I was miserable when I was with my dad because it was so clear that he prioritized his \u201cnew\u201d family over me. It\u2019s hard to describe how that feels, being on the outside looking in, feeling that you\u2019ve lost someone even though they\u2019re right in front of you. They\u2019ve just\u2026moved on without you, essentially. I was depressed as hell, and I still had my mom! I think your nephews mental health is the most important thing at this point.

Louis needs to not go back to that house and Tim needs to pull his head out of his ass.

That I\u2019ve put them all in an impossible situation because if Tom says no Louis will hate him, and if Tom says yes Tom will resent her and her kids for being the reason Louis left.\n\nWell, she is of course probably right in that that is what will happen. She's wrong in putting that on you, though. It's all on her and Tom; they're the ones who have been making Louis miserable for the last three years. They're the AHs, you're NTA.", "NTA. You didn't offer him another home. He came to you and asked for one. He's miserable and he asked for help. Ruby's hateful and aggressive response shows how little she actually cares about Louis. Tom has someone who is concerned for him, but Louis has no one in that house. \n\nIt doesn't have to be forever. You may take care of him or share custody for months or years, or you may just provide a temporary place of peace and rest for a sad, tired little boy. The important thing is that if he reaches out, you need to be there. Ruby is not important here. This is between you, Louis and Tom.", "NTA\u2014 I fully believe that we underestimate how much kids can understand their own needs and boundaries. I think some parents will just find ways to explain away  feelings they don\u2019t want to accept from their children, but Louis knows he\u2019s hurting and he needs adults that will hold space for him and try to help him. You\u2019re didn\u2019t do anything wrong in my opinion!", "Fertility treatments? So she wants to lock Tom in with a baby ASAP. If Louis is lonely now, just wait until 4 becomes 5 and he has to make way for the baby...", "> Our parents bought that house for Yas as a wedding present, that\u2019s why it was always in her name and they told her they wanted Louis to have it, they helped her set up the plans in case anything happened. I don\u2019t think Yas didn\u2019t trust Tom but I think my parents rightly saw that if anything happened to her, Tom wouldn\u2019t be the same and we couldn\u2019t necessarily trust the new version.\n\nSmart parents.", "> so while Tom may love his son, and may want the best for him. Tom isn\u2019t willing to sacrifice for his son. He has to think about it. Parents who put the best interests of their children first, which is your obligation as the parent of a minor child, don\u2019t have to think about it. They do whatever it takes, instinctively and immediately.\n\nPretty weird take. You can't just _do_ something \u201cinstinctively and immediately\u201d, just for the sake of doing something, whatever it is, before you know _what_ to do and whether what you're considering is the right thing to do.\n\nFor all we know, Tom is taking his time to think not on whether he should choose Ruby [sic!] over Louis, but on whether it's best for Louis to stay with Tom or go to OP."]}
