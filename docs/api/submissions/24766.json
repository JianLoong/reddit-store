I made up my mind to be there for Louis any way I could, and although I don\u2019t live close, I visited him every 6 weeks, even when I had just had my daughter, I check in with him daily, etc.\n\nTom met his fianc\u00e9 Ruby 8 months after Yas passed. Tom was lost without Yas, and he cut and pasted Ruby into his life quickly, and Louis hated it. Ruby came with three of her own kids, who moved into the house, suddenly Ruby was turning up at his school events and telling him what to do. Tom felt like it was an adjustment and that eventually Louis would let Ruby and her kids into his life. It never happened. \n\nIn the spring I started to get worried about Louis, so I convinced Tom to let him come and stay with me for the summer. When he arrived,  he just looked miserable and burnt out, but I was shocked how quickly he seemed to come back to life with a little time and fun. The only time he gets upset is when his dad or Ruby calls, or anyone mentions him going home. \n\nSix days ago, he sat me and my husband down and asked if we would consider letting him live with us. He said living with us is the only time he\u2019s felt happy since Yas. It just shattered my heart into a million pieces. We had a long talk with him, and a long talk with Tom, and Tom had a long talk with Louis. I think that was the first time in a long time that Tom actually heard how unhappy Louis is, and he\u2019s devastated. He said he would consider it, but I could see how hurt he was.\n\nThe night before last, I got a call from Ruby. She was howling down the phone that I am ruining Louis and Tom\u2019s relationship. She said that by offering Louis a way out I have basically made it impossible for them to bond. That I\u2019ve put them all in an impossible situation because if Tom says no Louis will hate him, and if Tom says yes Tom will resent her and her kids for being the reason Louis left. She said Louis had a chance to have a real family and that by taking him away just because it\u2019s hard, I\u2019m ruining that for him. She said I was a meddling b*tch out to steal Louis from the one parent he had left. I defended myself on the phone but once she hung up I cried. \n\nI just want what\u2019s best for Louis. When he arrived to stay with us, I didn\u2019t even know a child could look that old. Maybe my emotions made me cross a line. He already lost his mother, maybe he\u2019s too young to really know what it means to cut off his dad like this and I should have tried harder to make him see that, or not given him a way out. \n\nMy parents and husband think we\u2019re doing the right thing but a couple of friends I\u2019ve spoken to have said that while families are hard, Louis might regret leaving his dad later in life when he grows up and they don\u2019t have a bond. I know this is complex but I guess I\u2019m just wanting some perspective from people who aren\u2019t as emotionally plugged into this as I am.

Jesus Christ this is the obvious answer, RUBY is the fucking problem here!!! I understand losing a spouse is soul crushing, but Louis lost his mom too at such a young age. Never in a million years could I imagine being so heartbroken over my spouse\u2019s demise that I would jeopardize hurting my child so badly or losing my relationship with them. Imo it\u2019s disgusting.", "NTA - your nephew approached you, not the other way around. If you hadn\u2019t told Tom what had happened and your ability to help then it would be a different story. Additionally, Tom had seriously let his relationship slide with his son himself and that\u2019s not on you.", "NTA. Louis brought it up, not you, and you did the right thing by talking to Tom about it. It sounds possible that Ruby either knew this was an issue, or she didn't but now feels like she should have, and resents that you actually addressed it when she knows she or Tom should have. No matter what happens I hope someone looks into therapy or something to help Louis deal with all these changes in his life, it's hard for kids who feel they have to pretend to be okay when they aren't for the sake of the adults. I'm glad he has you and your husband as a safe space.", "NTA\n\nRuby sounds like the wicked stepmother from hell. \n\nThe kid lost him mum less than a year ago, yet she expects him to move on and accept her bossing him around. F that!\n\nYou are a shining light in Louis life, and it's great that he has you in his corner. \n\nIf Tom is really serious about putting Louis first, he would agree to let him stay with you because a child's mental health comes before an adults ego. He would then move heaven and earth to ensure the situation at home improves to a degree that Louis then feels comfortable moving back home. \n\nPlease don't let the harpy make you feel bad. All kids NEED a safe person they can be honest with. Be honoured you are that person.", "NTA - you were the first adult in ages that actually listened to Louis.  His dad and \"instant forced family\" definitely weren't listening.  Hoping that his dad will do what is best for his son.  Either have an ex-fiance, or let Louis life with you and your husband.", "NTA.\n\nThe situation at the moment is not one where Louis can be who he is. He will not bond with them if he is forced to. \n\nIt is a nice thing, you offer him to stay with you. I would also recomend that he should start therapy. Maybe also with his dad - if you live far away, maybe just a few times a year. So the can reconect. But it seems to be the best for him to get out of the situation at the moment. To regenerate and get the energy and support he might still need after his mother's death.", "NTA you offered for him to come for the summer so you could bond more with him and not have to take a weekend every six weeks to see him. He asked you cause he feels loved and wanted there. He can still have a relationship with his father. Yes he hasn\u2019t talked much to him over the summer but that\u2019s because sometimes people need space", "NTA. Louis came to you.  You and your home are a safe haven for him, and he\u2019s apparently thrived and wants to stay.  It\u2019s not the end of his and his dads relationship, maybe he\u2019ll move back later who knows, and if not, he is still his dad.   What\u2019s important right now is that Louis is unhappy at his dads house, and asked you if he could stay there.", "NTA\n\nYou sound like an amazing aunt who I would if my kid was so upset at home would happily allow them to stay at.\n\nThat said I think its important to understand who are his guardians still. Try and get frequent visits otherwise its easy for 2 parents looking after 3 kids already to forget about the 4th. They need to see him at least once a month if not more.\n\nRubys' actions are just coming from a place of neglect. She is likely trying but Louis isn't receiving it well or something else.", "Nta ask ruby just how was before you offered any better? The kid was miserable.", "NTA, Tom made a not uncommon mistake of bringing Ruby in too quickly. Louis is at an age where his opinion does matter. Based on the info you\u2019ve given, I would stand up and defend Louie\u2019s choice. Maybe look into therapy for Louie if that\u2019s an option. (And eventually the therapist might suggest including Tom in some sessions) Poor kid. I hope he starts to heal.", "Don\u2019t listen to friends who are hung up on what might be instead of what is happening right now. The way the words \u201ca way out\u201d were used implies that Ruby knows the kid feels miserable and I guess, trapped. You are in no way in the wrong here. I hope he gets to stay with you where he will be happy. NTA", "NTA and the bond stuff is BS because they've had 11 years to bond, they're not bonding now and he could bond better with his replacement family. \n\nA toxic family environment destroys.bonding opportunities. His dad could see him away from his new wife and they'd probably bond better, but if he doesn't want to make the fatherly effort.\n\nIt has me wondering if an 11 year-old child can himself initiate a custody change.", "NTA\n\n> That I\u2019ve put them all in an impossible situation because if Tom says no Louis will hate him, and if Tom says yes Tom will resent her and her kids for being the reason Louis left.\n\n***SHE IS THE REASON***.  \n\nShe just doesn't want Tom to resent her for it.  \n\nNote how everything is about her.\n\nI'm amazed Tom let it go this far and is acting surprised.", "NTA at all. Louis sat you both down. Louis was miserable and burnt out. Louis finally felt some happiness. You have helped him and are offering to continue helping him, because that\u2019s what Louis wants. \n\nYou\u2019re a great aunt", "Definitely NTA for offering but I do think you need to do this in a way that works for everyone and maintain his connection to his father. \n\nOffer for it to be a trial run for the fall semester with Louis visiting home on the same frequency you were visiting him (more if Tom comes to you). \n\nEncourage therapy both for Louis and for them as a family. Hopefully Ruby can learn to back off a little and build a relationship with Louis on his terms.", "INFO: how long has it been since Yas passed? How long has it been since Ruby started living with Tom?", "NTA.\n\nFirstly, you should definitely have a constructive conversation with Tom about Ruby's behaviour. Don't attack them. Just lay out the facts of what was said in the phone call.\n\nSecondly, Louis lost his mom. And not long after that, he was forced to live with 4 strangers in his own home. It's important that Tom open his eyes and recognise the position he placed his son in. Even if it's hurtful.", "NTA at all\n\nBlending a family is dicey and difficult thing. If Louis is having the problems he\u2019s having then Tom is not navigating or handling that change properly. He\u2019s probably being neglected and railroaded in his own home.\n\nRuby calling and blowing up, blaming YOU for Louis wanting to leave should tell you everything you need to know about the situation. If it really were about family and bonding she\u2019d be asking how to fix the situation to make it suitable for Louis. It\u2019s probably all about appearances for her. Or all about her children.", "NTA \n\nAnd don't take any more calls from the GF. The only people you are in negotiations with are your nephew and your BIL. He deals with his gf. If anyone is ruining anything it's the two of them, by not giving your nephew the time, space and support to process what has happened and what is happening.\n\nTell BIL you will only discuss the situation with him, abs hang up if she calls. And also contact a family law practice. If at any point your BIL says 'yes' you want to have all your ducks in a row so you can quickly and legally step in to be his guardian.", "NTA. I disagree that you're giving your nephew an easy way out.  He's making this request because his current family is not working for him.  I predict that the next step for him will be to run away from home every time chance that he gets.\n\nOn the plus side, you would be helping him find some stability in his life. What is more, you'd be helping him to create his found families because his biological family is toxic to him. Stick by your offer.  But insist that a condition of his living with you is that he and his dad spend quality time together.", "Please, give us an update about this. This is so sad. I think Ruby has to live in another house with her kids and Louis with his Dad, instead of Louis leaving his Dad. But if that doesn't happen and he is not happy, he needs to be out of there before he hits puberty and he will seek for other ways to cope with his feelings.", "NTA.  Ruby is in denial.  She and her kids have had ***four years*** to try and bond with Louis in order to form a \"family\".  If it hasn't happened in four years, ***it isn't going to happen at all.***  I wonder if Ruby has been trying to \"erase\" Yas from Louis' life.", "NAH \n\nYou all are in a tough situation. It\u2019s obviously Louise is hurting. The question, to me, is he hurting because of his living arrangement, the lose of his mother or his dad moving on too soon? These three situations are incredibly tough on their own let alone for a eleven year old. Putting them together creates an impossible road to navigate. In my opinion, pulling him out of the situation is only a temporary fix. \n\nI think it\u2019s time to get Louise some professional help and family therapy for father and son. \n\nIn the meantime you could offer giving Louise a break from time to time by letting him stay with you for a couple of days.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Please save Louis!!!", "NTA, this isn't my story to tell but something similar happened to someone close to me while they were just a kid, and at the time they knew that living with their relative would be better but they decided to stay with their parent, for reasons that I won't tell. What I should say is that they regret not making a different decision, their relationship with their parent and step parent only got worse. Because of that as soon as possible they literally crossed the country to stay as far away as possible and went NC, only now after years they are thinking in the pssoibility of going LC with their parent and just because  the parent got divorced from step parent. Ur nephew moving with u, might be what saves his relationship with his father. Talk to Tom ask if he would like to walk in the same shoes as my friend's parent did, not be invited to his son's wedding, lose the birth of his grandkids, lose his graduation... and the list goes on.", "Absolutely NTA it would seem like there is more to the story and the new wife.

If Louis went back, how long do you think it would take before he calls you, or worse hurts himself?", "NTA because the child came to you.", "NTA. Id even go as far as to say you are the only non asshole in this kids life. Your BIL and his wife absolutely do not care about this boy, his grief, his mental health. He\u2019s willing to let his son go rather than pause this relationship and help him through his grief. 11 years old is old enough to know he\u2019s miserable, to feel himself drowning. The way you described him when he arrived is extremely concerning and you wouldn\u2019t be a very good aunt if you didn\u2019t try to address it in some way. You are a representation of his mother and her side of the family which sounds like what he desperately needs right now and that should be the focus for all involved.", "NTA. If Louis regrets this choice later in life, that's something he can deal with then. He can't keep living in misery just incase he might have regrets later on. Ruby sounds awful. She clearly wants the perfect blended family and it just isn't happening. She is putting everyone else's needs over Louis'. He's a kid, his parental figures are supposed to be looking out for him and they're not. I hope he ends up moving in with you and gets the life he needs.", "Nta.

In reality I think he made that decision some time ago otherwise he would have known and checked in on his child's feelings.", "NTA, but you should let Tom know about Ruby's call.  It sounds like maybe Tom is having some serious second thoughts about their relationship due to the real chance of losing his son.  Maybe, just maybe his eyes are starting to open to the damage being done, and realizing he's been in the wrong about not stopping Ruby's behavior.  Either that or like someone else said, she just found out the house she has been living in belongs to your nephew not his father, and if he's not living there she may have to move out.  Either way, you're doing right by your nephew.  I hope Tom lets him stay with you, and remains active in his son's life until he gets the mess he created at home sorted out.", "NTA.  Let's be honest if Louis was a priority in this family, they never would have allowed him to stay with you for an entire summer with barely any contact.  \n\nI live out of state from my extended family.   I have allowed my children to go visit without me for short periods of time.   10 days max.

And Ruby should be trying to be his new best friend not his new stepmom, I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s necessary for parents to push on a kid to view someone they barely know as their new mom/stepmom it takes time and in some cases it never happens especially at an age like this it\u2019s something he will remember for the rest of his life.

I would understand if there was. 8 months seems way too soon even without a kid. \n\nAs I\u2019ve said, in my opinion, taking Louise out of the situation will only be a short lived solution.

Can you imagine how he will feel if he is forced to go back? And no doubt Ruby would try to punish him. Ruby lashed out at you because you prioritized Louis and his wellbeing, not her. They already have 4 kids in that house, 1 so deeply unhappy that he is definitely in emotional danger and they are trying to add another? \n\nSave Louis.

When he arrived, he just looked miserable and burnt out, but I was shocked how quickly he seemed to come back to life with a little time and fun.\n\nThank you for this. I grew up with an insanely abusive and neglectful mother in a situation of hoarding, animal hoarding, filth and poverty. My mother put on an excellent public face, as those with Borderline Personality Disorder can, so I never got out of her grasp until I became an adult. I never even knew my dad until 13 because she never let him in and tried to make our relation conditional (I was an attempted babytrap). I felt abandoned by him internalizing it as his fault... but I digress a bit.\n\n\nMY uncle knew his sister. He and my aunt knew I was suffering. They took me in every summer for 5 years. Every summer i left home emaciated, depressed, beaten down. Every summer i came back +weight, happy, emergized and optomistic. I credit that in large part with learning there was more than what I grew up on and giving me a brief slice of what my life should be one day. My mother got her way the year I tried to run away permanently.... and I don't fault them for not being extract me from her talons.\n\n They are both closer to me than my mother ever was. They're surrogate parents that I cherish, my mother is deceased and no more than another person who was in my life - albeit one that gave me great obstacles to overcome and become who I am\n\n\nNo matter what you're able to do for Louis, NTA NTA NT F'kin A.

I think that was the first time in a long time that Tom actually heard how unhappy Louis is, and he\u2019s devastated.*\n\nAnd even THIS didn't clue Tom in that he had moved on way too fast and that instead of prioritizing Ruby and her kids that he needs to end things with Ruby, bring his son home and the 2 of them need to work on healing together?\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your offering Louis a stable loving home.  Something he is in desperate need of.  His dad just brought these ppl into his life & he didn't even get a say in it.  Everyone says kids are resilient, but guess what?  That's not true.  Kids need to be loved, cherished, & feel safe.  It's clear that Louis only feels this when he's with you.  He may not understand that this will take away any chance at bonding with the new family, but clearly he doesn't want that.  This kid is quite old enough to know what he wants & he wants you.", "NTA. My parents divorced when my siblings and I were very young, and my mom started dating almost immediately. I never wanted my parents to get back together, but I was 100% against the man my mom made her 2nd husband. And they dated for nearly 5 years before they married. I was against him as a person, not just a parent. And we had to deal with abuse from him, my mom just ignored the abuse and dismissed whatever negative things we said (things that didn't go along with her rose-colored vision.) It didn't help that he had children as well, much older than my siblings and I, one of whom made life hell (still does, tbh.)\n\nYou're trying to do what's in LOUIS best interest, and if the relationship between father and son breaks down, it's because father didn't put in enough effort to listen to his son, to prioritize his child, to make the choice to not be selfish.\n\nRuby has no say in what happens and needs to keep her meddling self out of it. Blended families don't always happen like The Brady Bunch, and Ruby and Tom need to wise up to the fact that if Louis hasn't felt some semblance of a bond to Ruby or her kids by now, it's not likely to happen (imo, though I'm not a psychologist or any sort of professional, just from my own experience and discussing similar issues with others.)\n\nWhatever you do, keep being there for Louis. Offer him that space in your home, even if it'd for holidays or school breaks and summer vacations. Having that time to be away from the stress may be what he needs. Figure out a good schedule where he can still visit whomever he doesn't live with, to help foster the bond with his dad (but Tom needs to know that the bond or lack thereof is not due to Ruby/her kids, necessarily, but rather his choice to not focus any of his energy on his son.)", "Perhaps a good compromise would be for him to live with you but visit his dad in the holidays then the maximum time is spent with you and he doesn\u2019t lose that connection with his dad. \nWorth thinking about for sure.", "NTA. It sounds like this is what is best for Louis, which is everyone involved's moral obligation. You're doing the right thing by suggesting this. As someone else suggested, have the therapist talk with Tom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, them trying to add a 5th child when they are already emotionally neglecting one now is insane. I hate to be blunt, but nothing in Tom's actions suggest he is prioritizing his own son.", "NTA \n\nyou didn't initiate it, a child did and all you've done since is comfort a child. how could that be wrong?\n\nHis father was in his own miasma of pain and never understood his child's pain either.  if nothing else you've opened his eyes and they may well heal that bond even if he stays with you.\n\nas for Ruby? who cares. she doesn't have a dog in this race.  she failed to make the child happy and is forcing and issue that needs care not force.", "NTA. Tom really needs to look at his priorities. I can't imagine loving anyone more than a child or putting anyone before them, even a partner. If he has to he will need to separate from Ruby, or at the very least separate households to reintroduce them in a MUCH more gradual manner. Any loving parent would do this. Otherwise if he keeps things as they are and leaves Tom to go... well, that will speak volumes about his priorities as a father. I actually really hope he makes the right choice, much as you are a fantastic aunt, I think the boy really needs his father's  full love and attention.", "NTA. Ruby definitely is. She is someone who sees children as counters or tokens to be won. If Louis goes to live with you, she has \"lost\" a part of the Game of Life, in her mind. You and your husband see Louis as the child and small human being in training that he is. \n\nTom will have a MUCH better relationship with Louis in later years if he allows Louis to come live with you. Louis will resent being denied the chance at happiness and hold it against Tom. OTOH, Ruby will likely make life miserable for Tom if Louis slips out of her grasp. The best thing Tom could do is send him to live with you. But I think he will choose Ruby over Louis, since it seems he already has before. \n\nMy sympathies to you all.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly the best outcome would be a No, but  with Tom having really listened to the problems and will fix them.", "NTA. You can't force love. Therapy can't force love. Life is not a Hallmark movie where with enough time and wacky hijinks this boy will magically find common ground with his dad's new partner and learn to love his new siblings and they will all celebrate the potential future new baby on the way together. The older Louis gets, the less likely it is he'll ever see Ruby and hers as anything to do with him, especially if Ruby thinks she's *entitled* to that from him.\n\nPeople are confusing you by talking about this as a black and white situation. It's not 'take Louis in and permanently separate him from his father'. There are any number of arrangements you could propose. Perhaps you will all formally agree on times when you will get together and re-evaluate the arrangement to see if Louis is ready to try living with his father again. Perhaps living with you will be conditional on Louis still spending *some* period of time with Tom. You can set up a trial arrangement. It's disingenuous for anyone to pitch this as anything when there's no firm plan on the table yet!\n\nWhat this could give Tom and Louis, if Tom is willing to accept, is an opportunity to have some space and a lifting of pressure. It *might* be easier for Louis to connect with Tom and Ruby and the stepsiblings if he knows he only has to tolerate that situation for a short period of time.\n\nWhat's clear right now is that what's happening at home for Louis isn't working. And if that's because he feels crushed in that environment, it's very unlikely that the right steps can be taken for him in that environment.

You also can't tell me that he's not had to give up a lot of things in favor of her kids or that she didn't just come into HIS house and take over.
