You asking her mother to take the child to her room instead, is reasonable. \n\nYou demanding that your girlfriend leave her daughter alone in her bed when the child clearly needs her (that's why she came looking for her, duh) is asshole behavior. Completely disregarding how exhausting it must be for her to be up several times a night for her daughter to receive very important medical care, is beyond asshole behavior. \n\nYou shouldn't date a woman with a child, you clearly have no idea about her priorities, about children's emotional needs (and you don't need to be a parent to have a rough understanding of either), and equally relevant you have zero empathy for your girlfriend's nighttime struggles.

That will come with time.  But with her illness there are extenuating circumstances.  And your girlfriend has to wake up to give her medicine.

Girlfriend *did* leave the room with her daughter. OP is mad that girlfriend didn't *come back.* He was in a separate bedroom already, he's just throwing a tantrum bc he thinks he's more entitled to sharing a bed with her than her diabetic daughter is. \n\nAnd for the record, if girlfriend came on here and posted, \"AITA the asshole for making my diabetic daughter sleep alone when her blood sugar alarms are going off bc my boyfriend doesn't want me to sleep in her room,\" this sub would absolutely call her the asshole. Because she would be if she did what OP is asking of her, just as he is for asking it.", "I don't think the mom is saying it's ok to ignore the alarms. \n\nI think what op meant is that when the mom and daughter sleep in the same bed, the mom just has to wake up quickly, give the meds/juice then go back to sleep. That's why OP said the mom grabbed \"all her stuff to go sleep in the daughter's room\"\n\nIf the daughter isn't in the same bed, the mom has to get up walk to the daughter's room dispense care, then op expects mom to come back into op's bed. \n\nLike that's a lot more disruptive sleep than just waking up dispensing meds and going right back to sleep.", "so you'd rather she dies", "As mom who let their child come sleep in my bed with me when they were 7 and still did little \u201csleepovers\u201d occasionally until about 13, can confirm they ended up turning out like every normal teenager *who wants nothing to do with their mom and is generally mortified by them.\n\nAnd stays in their own bed.\n\n*hyperbole for the sake of emphasis", "that's not for another 7 years bro you probably won't even be in the picture anymore with this attitude", "I can see where people are coming from with their concerns if this is a persistent issue. However I wanted to add I do think the edit with your apology is a good start point to open a discussion about longer term planning and to see if this remains a realistic relationship for all of you. \n\nAlso not a diabetic myself so may be something I\u2019m missing, but would imagine it\u2019s worth a discussion with a doctor given the alarm goes off every night to maybe help with her long term health management.", "Read the post again. The mother needs to get up multiple times during the night to administer medication to the child. By sleeping in the same bed or at least the same room as the child makes it less disruptive to everyone's sleep.", "Where did you read that she ignores the alarms?", "You have posted your redundant baby monitor protip plenty of times, we get it.", "What? She does deal with the issue, that's why she's sleeping with the child in the first place. It's less disruptive to everyone's sleep if she can administer the meds if she's in the same bed or at least the same room as the child.", "When my son was 5, he pointed out that to him, it wasn't fair that we got to sleep together but he had to sleep by himself. He continued to climb into our bed until he was about 8. My husband would leave and sleep in his bed (or I would leave).\n\nHe sleeps in his own bed now. Kids will grow out of this.\n\nAlso - if your gf goes to her daughter in the night, it's natural that she is just going to fall asleep and stay there. Why should she keep herself awake rather than fall asleep with her child? It's also easier to take care of her child's needs if she is right there.", "I think they\u2019re both wankers for not splitting the responsibilities. He\u2019s the one working and shes wanting him to lose sleep but also he\u2019s the one whining if she goes to the other room.", "OP commented separately however since I wrote that it\u2019s clear it was ambiguous and can be taken as hee not wanting to walk to the other room. \n\nESH because they need to compromise", "Apparently not"]}
