You asking her mother to take the child to her room instead, is reasonable. \n\nYou demanding that your girlfriend leave her daughter alone in her bed when the child clearly needs her (that's why she came looking for her, duh) is asshole behavior. Completely disregarding how exhausting it must be for her to be up several times a night for her daughter to receive very important medical care, is beyond asshole behavior. \n\nYou shouldn't date a woman with a child, you clearly have no idea about her priorities, about children's emotional needs (and you don't need to be a parent to have a rough understanding of either), and equally relevant you have zero empathy for your girlfriend's nighttime struggles.

That will come with time.  But with her illness there are extenuating circumstances.  And your girlfriend has to wake up to give her medicine.
