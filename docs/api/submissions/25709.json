As soon as you become an adult, the responsibility is yours and noone elses. Before that, it isnt. She is an adult, so what she does now is noone elses fault. But what she did then probably was. I still think anyone judging her should listen to her part of the story first. Anyway, you should never blame an adult for what they did as a kid or even as a teenager. \n\nAnd something else: being in detention, getting expelled or getting into fights doesnt make someone a bad person and is not necessarilly harmful to anyone. Neither is hanging out with the wrong people. These werent thing she did to you, but to herself.

She scorched the earth/their life for years. This will take time. Ya don't flip a light switch and all is OK.", "NTA\n\nBecause right now it IS a no. I think you are reading into the situation a little bit with a big ol pair of rose colored glasses. Yes it's 3 months, but that's not a lot of time to get to know someone when and they presumably work fulltime and have responsibilities outside of the home. If they spend time together every weekend until Thanksgiving, that's still only twelve (12) visits to rebuild a relationship that has been dead for 8 years.  It's unreasonable and my answer would be no as well.\n\nIf the sister actually tried to make amends - like an apology - then maybe they would open the door to more. But you ignore then fact that the sister has traipsed back into their lives and has made no attempt to fix the damage she caused in her youth and expects things to go back to \"normal\" - like being invited to family events. Good for her for getting her life on track. But screw her if she thinks she deserves any special consideration until she has earned it. \n\nI don't know your life and don't want to presume. But your post smacks of \"But family....\" Family doesn't mean you are forgiven for anything. Being family doesn't mean you get to be terrible and abusive and then get welcomed back into the fold with open arms. Family means literally nothing when there is 18 years of hurt behind it. People with stable families never seem to grasp that because everyone involved is stable and looking out for each other. This is not that kind of case. \n\nThe sister clearly thinks she did nothing wrong while attacking OP for being a \"golden child\" when all being the \"golden child\" meant was that she wasn't punished constantly because unlike the sister, she wasn't causing problems constantly. It smacks of a massive lack of self-reflection and strongly hints that the sister is just older and less willing to take her hits in her older age but not fundamentally changed in how she sees the world and her place in it. That doubly means I wouldn't invite her to Thanksgiving either.", "10 years have passed, she's an actual stranger. \n\nYour  parents  have  every right to limit her access  until they feel  they  can trust her  again,  what you said  in  response  to her  rant was  the truth, and justified.\n\nPeople need  to be faced  with the  truth that  their  past  actions  have  consequences.

It's a dinner for a couple of hours, not moving in.", "Thanksgiving dinner can, depending on the family, be a several hours family visit, but it also includes allowing her open access to their home.

However, they're already blocking off even the possibility.\n\nOP doesn't offer a reason to believe she would steal or anything else significant. She says her sister was a troubled kid but has her life together now and wants to reconnect with her family.

The Prodigal Son is a parable for a reason.", "Ummmm we are worried she would steal since she has done it before. She wasn\u2019t just a brat she was awful. She would fight people, she would destroy things, she would yell and call people disgusting names. She would fine anything you liked and fuck it up for you.

Now that\u2019s she\u2019s older, you mention that she seems to be in a better place; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s currently looking for that family love and support that she feels she didn\u2019t get as a child, and from her perspective, she is still being denied that by your parents.

I don't fault her for being afraid of getting too close now but she seems to take joy in being the \"golden child\" when it really seems like, even though their parents \"tried\", they failed.

And of course it would be a long road to recovery which you can't force a kid to do, especially if they are still in an unhealthy environment for themselves. We just don't know what this girl has gone through so we really can't say one way or the other who the AH is. Sounds like they all still need a lot of therapy. Including OP who has a lot of justified resentment.", "Thank you. It was a lot to handle. I finally told my parents when I was 16, so I had more of a grasp on what to say, I just told them the whole thing, where I was, when it was and what happened. But it was the worst and hardest conversation I've ever had. My parents put me in therapy straight away, and my therapist was absolutely amazing. He taught me how to handle the trauma, and I don't know if I would have made it this far without his help. I probably would have just run away and let myself hit rock bottom before accepting help like it sounds like ops sister did. Keeping that a secret for 5 years took a big part of me. I'll never get back and made me respond to situations like op's sister did as well. The hardest part for me was accepting what happened and that it wasn't my fault, and as much as I hate to say it that's the vibe I got from this post as well, though I hope I'm wrong because it's a horrible thing to go through.", "Her story reminds me of a less severe version of my sister. She lied, stole, destroyed things, bullied me, tried to injure me / send me to Jesus, then had meltdowns if I ever tried to push back in any way. We had 1 family therapy session where she screamed and cried about how me being born ruined her life and she hated me for making her look bad (I was a boring kid/my mom was always breathing down my neck because of how out of control she was). I didn't go again because my mom didn't want me stressing my sister out which was a godsend because it was just an hour of abuse being hurled at me.\n\nLater found out she's got BPD and bipolar, refuses any treatment, blames everyone else for everything. I'm NC and regret nothing.", "The \u201cdark triad\u201d is a very simplistic way of looking at behavioral disorders. In all but a very few rare cases, behavior concerns and \u201cacting out\u201d behaviors are caused by a complex mix of trauma, disrupted attachment to caregivers, biological factors like exposure in utero to drugs and alcohol, mental health disorders, neurodivergent conditions like ASD/ADHD and parenting styles. Behavior doesn\u2019t just occur in a vacuum and kids aren\u2019t born \u201cbad\u201d. Source: I\u2019m a social worker and I work directly with many, many children and young adults with mental health disorders. Families ALWAYS contribute to behavior issues, whether they know it or not. That\u2019s why a \u201cfamily systems\u201d approach is the best way to treat behavior disorders in teens.", "Considering her rant and how she considers her sibling the golden child and how handled those facts,  it's safe to assume she hasn't changed one bit", "she cares more about looking like a happy family than actually making ammends. she hasnt changed much if at all. if she really had changed shed understand why people are weary. i hope ops parents dont make the same mistake my aunt did with her daughter(daughter killed my aunt) and trust too much too soon", "Small talk is how you reestablish contact. Then less trivial.convos. Then the big stuff. It seems though bith you and your parents want her to grovel and be punished for her turbulent teen years. You blame her for ypur parents decisions. Why havent you demanded they apologize for screwing up how they handled having a troubled teen.", "Yes, they did try, but at some point they gave up. Whether it was her fault, their fault, or no one\u2019s fault and just misfortune, she lost her family\u2019s support at 17.\n\nA lot of people in that situation end up dead or trafficked. She got it together despite the odds, which is great and shows a lot of positive changes.", "Pssssh, as someone who has worked in mental health/social services with teens for ten years, I think it's a little more nuanced than you present it (\"everything is always your parents' fault\"). Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. There isn't nearly enough context here for anyone to make a fair judgement.", "Why is she trying to come back into her parents life then. If she had terrible parents and being out of their lives is better for her then she should stay out no?", "I appreciate your perspective, thanks for the informative post.", "Sure.  But family is allowed to walk away once that person is an adult, if the behaviour gets too terrible.  Especially siblings.  They didn't consent to having a sibling.", "Oh for sure, something we'd all do well to keep in the back of our minds, though I try to give the poster the benefit of the doubt.", "If you're saying that op is lying, than there is no point in you being here. We work with the information provided by the op, not conjecture on your part because you somehow think shitty family members don't exist", "you're literally just creating your own theories on what happened to justify why the sister is a blameless victim instead of listening to op's actual accounting of the events. perhaps having a conversation about expecting an apology would help open up some doorways to building trust again, but that conversation shouldn't *need* to happen. the sister should have came in with that remorse in hand; there's already a problem if it needs to be goaded out of her.", "Thankfully, reality is not dictated by your beliefs.", "Did you not even read the post? OP's sister hasn't changed at all. Complaining about her sister being the golden child while smack dab in the middle of the process of reconnecting with her parents literally tells you everything you need to know.\n\nThe fact that OP's sister threw a tantrum after OP didn't coddle her and deny reality for her comfort is just the cherry on top.", ">One, couple, several.\n\nReminder that \"few\" and \"some\" also exist. You're literally leaping here lol. Skipping over things just to sound right.", "Then she should grow up and realize this year's thanksgiving is too soon. The fact that she's throwing another tantrum shows she hasn't changed as much as she tells everyone she did."]}
