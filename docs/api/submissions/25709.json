As soon as you become an adult, the responsibility is yours and noone elses. Before that, it isnt. She is an adult, so what she does now is noone elses fault. But what she did then probably was. I still think anyone judging her should listen to her part of the story first. Anyway, you should never blame an adult for what they did as a kid or even as a teenager. \n\nAnd something else: being in detention, getting expelled or getting into fights doesnt make someone a bad person and is not necessarilly harmful to anyone. Neither is hanging out with the wrong people. These werent thing she did to you, but to herself.

She scorched the earth/their life for years. This will take time. Ya don't flip a light switch and all is OK.", "NTA\n\nBecause right now it IS a no. I think you are reading into the situation a little bit with a big ol pair of rose colored glasses. Yes it's 3 months, but that's not a lot of time to get to know someone when and they presumably work fulltime and have responsibilities outside of the home. If they spend time together every weekend until Thanksgiving, that's still only twelve (12) visits to rebuild a relationship that has been dead for 8 years.  It's unreasonable and my answer would be no as well.\n\nIf the sister actually tried to make amends - like an apology - then maybe they would open the door to more. But you ignore then fact that the sister has traipsed back into their lives and has made no attempt to fix the damage she caused in her youth and expects things to go back to \"normal\" - like being invited to family events. Good for her for getting her life on track. But screw her if she thinks she deserves any special consideration until she has earned it. \n\nI don't know your life and don't want to presume. But your post smacks of \"But family....\" Family doesn't mean you are forgiven for anything. Being family doesn't mean you get to be terrible and abusive and then get welcomed back into the fold with open arms. Family means literally nothing when there is 18 years of hurt behind it. People with stable families never seem to grasp that because everyone involved is stable and looking out for each other. This is not that kind of case. \n\nThe sister clearly thinks she did nothing wrong while attacking OP for being a \"golden child\" when all being the \"golden child\" meant was that she wasn't punished constantly because unlike the sister, she wasn't causing problems constantly. It smacks of a massive lack of self-reflection and strongly hints that the sister is just older and less willing to take her hits in her older age but not fundamentally changed in how she sees the world and her place in it. That doubly means I wouldn't invite her to Thanksgiving either.", "10 years have passed, she's an actual stranger. \n\nYour  parents  have  every right to limit her access  until they feel  they  can trust her  again,  what you said  in  response  to her  rant was  the truth, and justified.\n\nPeople need  to be faced  with the  truth that  their  past  actions  have  consequences.

It's a dinner for a couple of hours, not moving in.", "Thanksgiving dinner can, depending on the family, be a several hours family visit, but it also includes allowing her open access to their home.

However, they're already blocking off even the possibility.\n\nOP doesn't offer a reason to believe she would steal or anything else significant. She says her sister was a troubled kid but has her life together now and wants to reconnect with her family.

The Prodigal Son is a parable for a reason.", "Ummmm we are worried she would steal since she has done it before. She wasn\u2019t just a brat she was awful. She would fight people, she would destroy things, she would yell and call people disgusting names. She would fine anything you liked and fuck it up for you.

Maybe at some point you and your sister can have an honest conversation about what triggered all of this in her and maybe that can help mend the burned bridges. If something traumatic happened to her that she didn\u2019t want to talk about but now she\u2019s learned to cope and process it, that might go far in helping mend the burnt bridges. My sister sounds alot like your sister and as an adult she was finally able to tell us that she had been SA\u2019d by my aunt\u2019s boyfriend When our aunt was babysitting us  and it\u2019s one of the earliest memories she has and alot of her behavior stemmed from trauma around that.", "I'm not surprised by boundaries either.

I was curious because I found it strange that it sounded like your parents really did try to help her, yet she didn't do a 180 until she was away from them.\n\nI was wondering if they held some sort of subconscious resentment towards her early in her life that caused her to suffer Golem Effect.

Her mindset seems is in child mode: parents have to host me, fulfill my needs, cater to me. She has little recognition and/or insight to the depth of pain her actions caused then she disappeared; they didn't know if she was dead of alive. \n\nAA has a forgiveness step. Might sound odd but damn it's powerful. Rebuilding and honoring relationships require transparency, truth and authentic actions. She needs to apologize and verbalizing how and why she chose to do what she's did. Lastly, and the part most people don't do, what has she done and will do to not repeat this.  No one's in a rush. OP and parents deserve this at a minimum.\n\nHer fixation of blaming OP as a golden child suggests they need to be cautious, take it slow, small steps and short amounts of time is best.

It's 12 possible visits before Thanksgiving. That's all. That's not a lot of time and I think it's telling that you ignored it to go back to your point that the family needs to give her a chance. They ARE giving her a chance by opening the door to rebuilding. But that's not a free pass man. That doesn't mean everything is forgiven. Especially when she has made no attempt to fix the situation.\n\n You might not believe that this is true, but that's my point about how you seem to have Rose colored glasses on. People DO act like this, even if you personally find it hard to believe.  I have direct experience in my own life with this kind of thing. And 20 years later the family member would rather never speak to me again then apologize for what they did or try and make amends. And people like you made out like I was the problem because I wasn't willing to restart the cycle of abuse and pain all over again just because they had a hard time believing that this (publicly) God fearing person could do those kinds of things, let alone not feel any regret for their actions. There MUST be something else to the story. Well spoiler, they're just an asshole who prefers their internal narrative never be challenged by the facts of their own actions.

Sister didn't apologise and you trying to gaslight her is both pointless and massively shitty.", "Because other people aren't you. 3 months is 100% not enough time for me. It's 100% not enough time for lots of people responding to you. Its 100% not enough yime for the parents or for OP. I am open to the fact that *some* people can get over the history of their past that quickly. I am open to the fact that people do fall in love and get married in under 3 months. But we aren't talking about YOU and what YOU are comfortable with. And pointing at extreme examples and then trying to apply that to all situations is what you are doing and what I take umbrage with.\n\nI might say I love you to a partner after 3 months, but I'm not getting married that quick. Other do. And that's fine. But that doesn't change the fact that marriages that occur that quickly also tend to end. Rushing forgiveness when all parties are not ready is asking for the relationship to tank. \n\nLike 12 visits at about 2hrs a pop means that at minimum, they will have spent 24hrs with the sister before Thanksgiving.  Yes, they can spend more time with her, but people have fulltime jobs and responsibilities that take up their time. I personally think I am being quite reasonable about how much time at minimum they have to spend with and get to know a literal stranger. They could spend 10 hours a week if they chose and get 120hrs of bonding time in before Thanksgiving,  but that is unlikely when the parents and OP have already made it clear that they are easing back into the relationship. \n\nI guess I have to ask, why do you think the family owes the sister an invite to Thanksgiving? Why does she deserve an invite at the expense of the family's comfort? You might disagree about whether they should still be uncomfortable, but you can't argue *THAT THEY DO* feel uncomfortable. And that there is a long history of bad behavior. And that as you have been shown multiple times,  the sister isn't apologetic at all. So why does she deserve this? Would you demand the same if she was just a family friend as opposed to a sister? If the answer is no, then consider you might have some toxic opinions on family and the influence it should have on people's lives."]}
