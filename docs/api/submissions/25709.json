As soon as you become an adult, the responsibility is yours and noone elses. Before that, it isnt. She is an adult, so what she does now is noone elses fault. But what she did then probably was. I still think anyone judging her should listen to her part of the story first. Anyway, you should never blame an adult for what they did as a kid or even as a teenager. \n\nAnd something else: being in detention, getting expelled or getting into fights doesnt make someone a bad person and is not necessarilly harmful to anyone. Neither is hanging out with the wrong people. These werent thing she did to you, but to herself.

She scorched the earth/their life for years. This will take time. Ya don't flip a light switch and all is OK.", "NTA\n\nBecause right now it IS a no. I think you are reading into the situation a little bit with a big ol pair of rose colored glasses. Yes it's 3 months, but that's not a lot of time to get to know someone when and they presumably work fulltime and have responsibilities outside of the home. If they spend time together every weekend until Thanksgiving, that's still only twelve (12) visits to rebuild a relationship that has been dead for 8 years.  It's unreasonable and my answer would be no as well.\n\nIf the sister actually tried to make amends - like an apology - then maybe they would open the door to more. But you ignore then fact that the sister has traipsed back into their lives and has made no attempt to fix the damage she caused in her youth and expects things to go back to \"normal\" - like being invited to family events. Good for her for getting her life on track. But screw her if she thinks she deserves any special consideration until she has earned it. \n\nI don't know your life and don't want to presume. But your post smacks of \"But family....\" Family doesn't mean you are forgiven for anything. Being family doesn't mean you get to be terrible and abusive and then get welcomed back into the fold with open arms. Family means literally nothing when there is 18 years of hurt behind it. People with stable families never seem to grasp that because everyone involved is stable and looking out for each other. This is not that kind of case. \n\nThe sister clearly thinks she did nothing wrong while attacking OP for being a \"golden child\" when all being the \"golden child\" meant was that she wasn't punished constantly because unlike the sister, she wasn't causing problems constantly. It smacks of a massive lack of self-reflection and strongly hints that the sister is just older and less willing to take her hits in her older age but not fundamentally changed in how she sees the world and her place in it. That doubly means I wouldn't invite her to Thanksgiving either.", "10 years have passed, she's an actual stranger. \n\nYour  parents  have  every right to limit her access  until they feel  they  can trust her  again,  what you said  in  response  to her  rant was  the truth, and justified.\n\nPeople need  to be faced  with the  truth that  their  past  actions  have  consequences.

It's a dinner for a couple of hours, not moving in.", "Thanksgiving dinner can, depending on the family, be a several hours family visit, but it also includes allowing her open access to their home.

However, they're already blocking off even the possibility.\n\nOP doesn't offer a reason to believe she would steal or anything else significant.

The Prodigal Son is a parable for a reason.", "Ummmm we are worried she would steal since she has done it before. She wasn\u2019t just a brat she was awful. She would fight people, she would destroy things, she would yell and call people disgusting names. She would fine anything you liked and fuck it up for you.

I don\u2019t know your parents or her situation, but clearly something was going on that was overlooked. Now that\u2019s she\u2019s older, you mention that she seems to be in a better place; I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s currently looking for that family love and support that she feels she didn\u2019t get as a child, and from her perspective, she is still being denied that by your parents.

There is a lot of unprocessed anger and resentment towards her, and unprocessed grief in what you lost and what you didn\u2019t get to have as a child due to your experiences with your sister.

Sister is still only regarded as a 'problem' that somehow needs to earn a chance to sit down to dinner with her family? I think sister is on to something and my vote to OP is YTA. Integrating your sister back into the family, even just a slim chance of intergrating her back in successfully, should take overwhelming precidence over the danger of a meal being ruined. OMG - just writing that out makes is so much worse. Your sister left as barely more than a child and is now an adult trying to reestablish connection and you all won't risk a meal being \"ruined\"? WTF?\n\nThe other thing golden children often don't realize is that while less painful, the family dynamic the parents set up is equally damaging to the golden child. My recommendation is for OP to try to research narsitisci family relationships and maybe get individual couselling for themselves. Claiming not wanting any children in case they are like sister is kind of extreme and they \"horrendous\" actions of their sister as a child seem like relatively standard fare for a troubled teen. Why does OP feel so helpless to do a better job as a parent? It is extreme, I think.", "The most sane reply I've read so far. Someone can change a lot in 7 years and it's unfair to judge them for things that happened when they were a literal CHILD.", "Someone asked if they would be willing to go to group therapy and OP responded saying \"fuck no we tried that when she was 16 and it was awful\" \n\nWhen she was 16! A decade ago! A child! \n\nAlso very suspicious tbh. How can a therapy session turn into a nightmare, with a practitioner present? I'd be willing to bet the rest of the family has a lot to answer for and couldn't deal with the therapist bringing that up.", "Yeah and it's really sad that one camp refuses to understand the other camp, or even to use basic empathy.", "I understand the grievance with the parents, but OP has no obligation to tiptoe around the subject, as it is. The 17 year old was incredibly problematic and at the age of 18, did a disappearing act and got back almost a decade later. You need to understand that there's big problems with that, and according to OP, professional help was given to said 17 year old, to no avail. Shows how much the crowd you are with and the habits you cultivate can fuck you up.\n\nI wish the best for the sibling, obviously, but I disagree with OP being an asshole on this one. Sometimes people (especially problematic people) need to hear the painful truth from someone they care about. I know I had to and I turned my life around, same as a couple of friends and relatives I know. Even that's not a guarantee for change though.", "Same.

Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of ways a parent can fuck up a kid, but an unwillingness to acknowledge there are human limits to parents is no better than refusing to acknowledge that they can be wrong.

There might have been something they could have done, maybe, but it sounds like your sister was just fundamentally predisposed to behaviour like this.\n\nAt the end of the day some people just...**are** screwed up inside, and blaming it entirely on nurture excuses the inherent possibility of nature on an individuals part.", "Nah, they gotta be a perma-victim\n\n\"Why are you still bringing that up?\" (even though they never apologized, fixed, or paid for damages)\n\n\"Why am I always the bad guy?\"\n\n\"THEY need to apologize to ME for <tiniest thing ever>\"", ">they would\u2019ve discovered I have ASD and ADHD and I function just fine with therapy and skills they didn\u2019t bother to give me.\n\nThis is literally my exact same experience.

What were you saying it in response to? What had she said just before that? Did she explain why she cursed out? Did you ask?\n\n> She ripped it up after mom told her no to an event.

Did you ask?\n\n\nIf nothing else, I would *strongly* recommend that you get into personal therapy, because you seem to be holding onto some very strong, simmering anger here.", "I'm an older brother, and my little sister was /exactly/ like this growing up.  She would destroy my things, she would fight with me, she would scream and argue, she would steal my stuff.  I always blamed her for all the chaos, and I wanted nothing to do with her until I was 24, and I came across the term \"childhood emotional neglect\"\n\nHere are a few of the symptoms:\n\nNegativity during parent-child interactions and anger towards the parent  \nPoor peer relationships   \nDisruptive and impulsive behavior, including aggression, hostility, and oppositional  \nMore behavioral issues, including conduct disorder symptoms\n\nThere's are the outward facing symptoms that you see, and are justifiably upset at having to deal with, but take a second to read the following inner symptoms, that you've probably never thought about her experiencing. (and might experience some yourself, as I do)\n\nLow self-esteem and self-compassion   \nShame, humiliation, self-blame, and feelings of worthlessness   \nAttention problems   \nSymptoms of depressive disorder   \nSymptoms of anxiety disorder\n\nFor context, I always thought my parents were decent parents.  They weren't perfect, my dad was an alcoholic for many years, but other than that, they were good parents.  It wasn't until I started reading about emotional neglect that I realized my parents failed me and my sister in extremely important ways.  They consistently dismissed our emotions.  We were not free or encouraged to talk about our feelings.  If we ever did, we usually got some \"just get over it\" type of response.  We never had an actual genuine relationship with our dad (our parents were divorced).  We never hung out, we never really spoke about much.  If we have problems and asked for help, or asked questions, he would talk to us like we were an idiot for being 10 years old and not knowing how to boil water.  He would consistently point out all the ways we were \"fucking up\", and find any little issue to complain about.\n\nOur parents are supposed to make us feel good about ourselves.  We are supposed to want to talk to them about our lives and our problems, and we are supposed to consider them a thing of safety, somewhere we can go when the going gets tough and they will make things better.  They were supposed to be someone who could count on to genuinely listen to us, to our concerns and our problems, and to help us in a kind and caring way.  For people with emotionally neglectful parents, at best, they were absent in these.  They didn't really help us.  They weren't really available for us to talk.  They didn't really listen.  Often times, this best case scenario wasn't the case.  For me, talking to my dad or expressing our emotions would get us mocked.  Talking to him in any capacity did not make us feel safe, it usually made us feel attacked.  I still have nightmares that are simply me trying to talk to my dad and him not listening to a word I said.\n\nYou say your sister avoids talking about why she hates your parents.  Consider that whenever she tried to talk to your parents, they would yell at her, or tell her all the ways she's wrong, tell her how it's her fault that they do the things they do.  She isn't avoiding the conversation for no reason, she's avoiding the conversation because historically, having the conversation has been nothing but a waste of time at best, and a reason to be attacked and ridiculed at worst.\n\nYou say she hasn't apologized, but consider again that throughout your entire childhood, your parents likely were telling her to apologize for all the ways she was \"wronging\" the family.  All the things that /she/ was doing.  But consider that they probably never apologized for anything that they did wrong.  Everybody else was perfect, and your sister was the only problem (FYI, this is where the \"golden child\" comes from, it's from narcissistic parent discussions and indicates a child who can do nothing wrong, whereas your sister would be the \"scapegoat\" who is responsible for all the issues in the family, and who's responsibility it is to apologize and make up for all of their perceived issues and mistakes)\n\nMy sister never apologized, until I apologized to her.  She was horrible to me, but I was equally bad to her.  I continually shut her out, refused to support her or listen to her.  Realistically growing up, I was /never/ there for her, when I should have been.  But I resented her and blamed her for all the chaos, so I repeatedly slammed my door in her face, told her to leave me the fuck alone whenever she would try to be close to me (which was all the time, because realistically she was completely alone and desperate for some sort of connection). I have apologized repeatedly for not being there for her, especially because I was her big brother.  I should have been there for her.  I should have listened to her.  I should have understood her and supported her.  Instead, I mimicked my father, I shut her out, I shut her down.\n\nYou don't owe your sister anything, but I would suggest you google 'childhood emotional neglect' and consider the possibility that your parents weren't as perfect as you think.  There was likely an entire emotional connection/safety component that was missing, if not for you, at least for your sister.", "Exactly. \n\nAlso everyone remembers things differently. I've been unpacking some of my little-t trauma from my childhood and openly sharing my \"journey\" with it. \n\nMy siblings and I have talked and they apologized to me about it (as if they played a part) and were like we didn't know! And I'm like well you guys didn't play a part so no apology, but I didn't either until I went to therapy lmao. \n\nI don't remember all the times my siblings shared when Mom or dad were mean to them or whatever. \n\n\nI'm so curious how much of OP's perspective was shared by her parents hating her older and talking about her in a negative way that op is like \"yeah that's all she was!\"", "Also, she's so awful that the best and only actual example of her awful behavior is that she ruined a wedding dress with no context?", "Lol I\u2019m the 12 year older sibling in this case.

They would tell their friends and our family how terrible I was, and complain about me constantly in front of me. By the time I was a teenager I had awful anxiety and depression, which once again got treated as me acting out towards them. By the time we got more or less forced into therapy, my mom would drop the therapist as soon as they disagreed with her. By the time I was 16/17 I stopped trying to follow the rules because nothing I did made anything better so why keep trying at that point? There is a ton more that happened and things only got worse until I was permanently kicked out at 18 right after graduating.

For instance, when penalizing one or both children they will put the responsibility for their decision onto one of the children in a way to divert any negative feelings from themselves, but ultimately the decision is still theirs to make. Ex.: Family is planning on making a trip soon and the children are very excited. Their father on the other hand would rather stay home. But as the day of the trip is coming closer Child A commits some sort misbehavior. Maybe they failed a test, didn't do their chores or engaged in a fight with their sibling. Not the point. The point is that Father didn't want to go, but now he has an excuse to cancel the whole thing and avert any blame. He will cancel the whole trip and blame it on Child A's misbehavior, and now Child B will resent Child A for missing on a very wanted vacation without inconveniencing Father for his decision. \n\nAbusive parents may also employ an unsuspecting child in the abuse of another in different ways. Families with abusive parents are disfunctional in essence, and the parents will without fail blame one child for the family dynamics. To sustain this narrative they will employ other family members into their bullying in a similar way that happens in an abusive marriage with children involved. The victim of cronical abuse will naturally have poor mental health due to the fact that they were under abuse while their abuser will not. As a consequence the abuser could appear as way more collected during conflicts. This can cause oursiders to side with the abuser in conflicts as we tend to judge the distressed party as unreliable and overtly emotional when compared to a calm person, ignoring the fact that they only are distressed because of years of abuse. The abuser does treat family members that side with them well, reinforcing the narrative that the victim is the sole problem in their family. I had this going on in my family growing up. My father was abusive towards my mother and used me to reinforce to her that she was out of her mind. As a child I truly believed that. He is a vey manipulative person and had a way of playing us against each other. My mother scarred me, but our relationship was unhealthy because of my father's abuse onto my mother to begin with. Now that I am wiser I can see through his abuse and have a good relationship with mom.\n\nOP's family could very well have had a dynamic like this going on, in which case OP also owes her sister an apology. The fact that Sister got her stuff together the moment she got away from her family says something. And she did so as she lost access to therapy.

What wasn't good enough? Anything below 98%. Literally if I came home with a 99%, their response wasn't \"Wow what a great mark!\" (Especially given I was taking university level advanced classes in high school), it was instead a sneering, \"Only 99? You must've made a stupid mistake somewhere. What did you miss?\"\n\nI'd get yelled at for staying up too late or getting up too early, but after 10 or before 6 was the only time I could get to do homework or study. They assumed I must be pregnant and not just looking for a time to study where I knew I wouldn't be interrupted with violence or screaming or demands I be an unpaid nanny. \n\nI also got grounded for installing a lock on my door when the foster kids started sneaking into my room at night and attacking me in my sleep. \"There are no locks in this house!\" \n\n(Their room had a lock after the first time one of the kids smeared shit on them in their sleep. The kids didn't even try to stab them like they did me. But I should just put up with it, apparently and trust that a kid who'd already killed several of my pets and attacked me with weapons on several occasions didn't *actually* wanna kill me and it was just her way of acting out to push me away because she was so afraid of getting attached. Hahaaaaa... Fuck that. So then I started bracing it with a dresser and when they threatened to take my dresser away I told them they may as well take everything away because I wouldn't stop bracing it so I could sleep without worry I'd be murdered.

Why else would she be able to get her life together when they were no longer part of the picture.", "EXACTLY ONCE TRUST IS BROKEN IT WONT EVER BE THE SAME", "you sound like a nightmare. thank god she got away from you.", "stay away from her. you haven\u2019t contributed anything good or helpful to her life and you\u2019re not going to start now. i feel awful for her and i hope she gains the self-esteem to cut you out for good.", "You know,you asked a question in this post and you got answers and when you didn't like them you said you don't give a shit. Is this how you treat your sister too? My way or the highway? Is this what you saw your parents do?", "It was pretty similar with my brother and I. The golden child title wasn\u2019t (and isn\u2019t) permanent and in a grim way this brought us closer.", "I think the parents know more than they let OP know. That\u2019s just my assumption from personal experience, though.", "agreed, but i would not compare that form of abuse to scapegoat abuse, or equate them in any way. i don\u2019t think scapegoated children need to be held accountable for recognizing or validating their golden siblings\u2019 abuse. that being said, i do think the parents need to be held accountable for abusing both their golden and scapegoated children, so i see your point.", "Families with that dynamic don\u2019t make the golden child move schools and lose their friends so the scapegoat can get a second chance from their shitty behaviour.", "Yeah, for the first year of my therapy, when I was 13-14, I was scared that the therapist was gonna \u201ctell on me\u201d to my parents (especially re: how I felt about them), so I stuck to surface level stuff like panic attacks at school or insomnia. Only later on I opened up more.", "It's only been 8 years and they have no proof she's changed.", "those parents are not in the wrong in the slightest. you have to earn trust\u2014she clearly wasn\u2019t someone they could trust back then and disappearing for 8 years doesn\u2019t magically make that trust come back. her teenage behavior absolutely should be held against her until **she can prove** that she\u2019s changed. unless that can happen she doesn\u2019t deserve to have them take a risk again.", "I don't think OP knows yet. I don't think she is self aware enough to start questioning things. Give her 10-20 years and it will come out.", "I would not be surprised. If they are those types of parents, they usually keep their kids from going to therapy because they don't want to get exposed or for someone to take the kids side. but maybe they thought they were smart enough to manipulate the therapist and they failed. I didn't like how when people asked if they tried everything they could the OP answered therapy because that still doesn't tell the full story.", "Not saying this goes one way or another but you should go to therapy for yourself if you\u2019re still feeling this angry 10 years later. It could really consume you if you don\u2019t have a third party to talk it out with.", "This. It's not like it's been ten years of better behavior. It's been eight years of there not being trouble because sister hasn't been seen or heard from.\n\nRadio silence, while a welcome change, is not actually demonstrated better behavior.\n\nSister's track record of \"better\" behavior with the family is very, very brief, especially when compared to the years and years of misery.", "Or she got slapped across the face by the reality of the life she thought she wanted. My younger sister had a rough number of years, she almost had a romanticized view of chaos, drama, struggle, depression, and abuse. At one point she *wanted* braces because she thought they looked cool. We were supportive of any and every craft, club, team, sport, and interest she had, and I got the same. We were too boring. She acted like we were horrible, abusive, neglectful, she wanted...... I forget the term but it's when a minor gets more rights because their family is shit. Our mom asked her why and she literally couldn't give any reasons. \n\nAnyway, she moved out the night she turned 18 and came back for her stuff with her first tattoo. After a couple years our parents decided to downsize and we'd move to a living space we designed. My sister heard and asked if she could move in and pay rent, and she was moved in with her stuff before us. Our mom agreed and was so happy to be able to know that she was safe and alive, hearing her getting ready for her work and arriving home after working nights. She came back humbled after realizing what I've known all along: that we've got it good with hard working parents who support both of us in our endeavors. Now she's moved back out after saving money to put down on her own house but she's still got her key. Our mom misses her and her cats and is always happy when she pops in.", "I know someone similar who is literally like 67 years old.\n\nSome people never grow up."]}
