If she doesn't stop acting like that, it might never happen.", "NTA. \n\nIn general, I recommend focusing on people's actions rather than their nature, so something like \"I'm only the \"golden child\" because you keep choosing to hurt the family.\" \n\nPeople aren't necessarily in control of their nature, but they are in control \\[hypothetically\\] of their actions, and if there's any chance of things \"clicking\" for them one day, then best to press on those buttons. \n\nBut it sounds like she's not inclined to really self-reflect, or consider how her actions affect other people, and setting a harsh boundary might just, at the very least, help her see that you and your folks won't be available for her to grift and abuse. \n\nHope she gets her stuff together.", "INFO: Did your parents ever try to... help your sister? Take her to therapy and a psychiatrist? Change what school she was going to?

You can tell when people are sincere and have really changed when they accept the limits people they have wronged put on them. She hasn't changed and is just as destructive and entitled as she ever was.", "NTA. People do change, but you also have the right to disbelieve it. That remark was harsh, but she was also the first to start taking her anger out on you. If you\u2019re willing, perhaps group therapy?", "NTA well well if it the consequences of her own actions. On a more serious note your sister needs to realize that she broke your parents trust and its going to take time to get that back. I hope it works out for you guys.", "What caught it was at the end, your sister never apologized for her behavior.\n\nI think in these situations, the wrong doing has to own the past behavior.  they have to be sincere in the apologies and perhaps other acts of contrition.\n\nShe can think you were the golden child, but parents will trust the well behaved child. and allow that child more liberties.

I have sympathy for her mental struggles (she's clearly got some shit to deal with in her head), but the fact that she's still trying to make it your problem is not something you should waste time on. \n\nHopefully she continues to improve, but you're not obliged to sugar-coat things and support her self-victimhood.", "NTA - Trust is earned and should not be granted freely. \n\nBerated as a 'golden child'? She is weaponizing this to diminish and deflect her past actions. She's yet to take responsibility for her actions. She's did not state an apology to you or your parents (detail in comments). \n\nIt's great she has her 'life together' but what does that mean? Her dysregulated behavior as a minor remains a mystery. Of course you three are cautious. Her past may have included: unmedicated mental illness and substance use. It takes time to nurture and solidify any relationship; people are not light switches.", "NTA. She ran away from accountability and still won\u2019t accept it. She hasn\u2019t changed and your parents made a good call not letting her fully back yet", "Yes they tried. We moved once to a new school to help her, I\u2019m still bitter I had to move and lost all my friends for her. She was in detention the first week of the new school.\n\nShe was awful. Therapy happened with her, group therapy was a nightmare. \n\nI don\u2019t blame my parents,  it was bad enough is that I don\u2019t want to have kid since I worry they would be like her", "Oh fuck no, we tried that when she was 16 my god never again.\n\nI never wanted to walk into a therapy session with her agian", "We are two years apart, my parents trusted me a I was the golden child.

She is the main reason I don\u2019t want kids.", "She was awful to others I wish she was kind to other and it was just us but no. She got into sooooo many fights. She was in detention so much, she got expelled once\u2019s.\n\nIf you made her mad she would make it known.", "So op should've just let sister insult her without saying anything?? Why shoukd she be a doormat??", "Don't call someone a golden child, don't shit. People want to make amends, then they need to be HONEST with themselves.", "NTA then. If your parents sincerely tried and attempted professional help then there's only so much they can do. \n\nYour parents may still be assholes, depending on the full context. It's strange to tell your child that her behavior from 10 years ago, when they were a child, is why they can't come to Thanksgiving.", "I hope you're in therapy sessions without her, at least.", "> Oh fuck no, we tried that when she was 16 my god never again.\n\nWell that makes your parents AHs then, they failed her for so long, only starting at 16 is just sad", "Well that's her fault and she needs to come to terms with it. You should just cut her out of your life. She will ruin your adulthood as well as your childhood", "Well... my philosophy is this. As soon as you become an adult, the responsibility is yours and noone elses. Before that, it isnt. She is an adult, so what she does now is noone elses fault. But what she did then probably was. I still think anyone judging her should listen to her part of the story first. Anyway, you should never blame an adult for what they did as a kid or even as a teenager. \n\nAnd something else: being in detention, getting expelled or getting into fights doesnt make someone a bad person and is not necessarilly harmful to anyone. Neither is hanging out with the wrong people. These werent thing she did to you, but to herself. Destroying her parents property is another thing, but compared to the mess that is probably taking place inside her, Id say it could have been much, much worse. Shes kinda like all bark and no bite. Or just a little bite, but a lot of bark.", "Being the bigger person isn\u2019t being a doormat. Unless acting like her sister is what she is going for, she made the wrong choice.", "And yet this didn\u2019t solve anything for anybody.", "Because they don\u2019t trust her not to ruin their house, they don\u2019t trust her not to steal anything or destroy anything important if she gets mad. They don\u2019t trust her not to start an argument. They don\u2019t trust her not to ruin a nice family event\n\nThey don\u2019t trust her", "Wait there. \nYes, she was a teenager but it takes time and having new experiences with her to trust her again. Trust is easily lost and it is even harder ro earn it back than to gain it from the very beginning. \n\nI don't think that OP's parents are assholes. They are making steps at their own pace. It's not something they force themselves ro rush.", "Honestly the fact that OP's sister got her life together after her parents were removed from it makes me more likely to think these are awful parents.", "That was group therapy, she was in single therapy and parent kid therapy before then.\n\nMy parents tried a lot of her.", ">Being the bigger person isn\u2019t being a doormat.\n\nIt's exactly what it is. \n\n>Unless acting like her sister is what she is going for, she made the wrong choice.\n\nHer sister insulted her without reason. Op answered with the truth. It's not the same thing at all. Putting someone in their place after *they* start a fight and attack you doesn't make someone an asshole. Putting up with verbal abuse to be \"the bigger person\" is being a doormat. Fo with this bs", "We don't know that yet.", "Thanksgiving is 3 months away though, and they already blocked off the possibility of building up sufficient trust by then due to her behavior as a child.", "Sure, but they aren't even extending the *possibility* that in 3 months she might have earned enough trust to come over for dinner. Not move in or take power of attorney, but dinner for a couple of hours.", "\u2026can I ask how that group therapy went? \n\nTotally fine if you\u2019re not comfortable answering, I\u2019m just wondering if you ever got any insight into her behavior, even if that insight didn\u2019t actually change anything.", "Even if you did these behaviors as a child, you still set fire to a bridge. You wouldn\u2019t tell a victim a bullying to trust their bully since they did it when they were a kid.\n\nShe has a very long way to go in order to get that trust back. Starting with an apology would be a good start and she hasn\u2019t done that. The trust is gone and it\u2019s not going to come back in 3 months. Also by her rant I don\u2019t trust her either.", "They've had no contact w/her for nearly a decade. And three months isn't very long to get to re-know somebody and gain their trust. She hasn't been a member of the family for years. She can't expect to come back to open arms.", "You suggest 3 months sufficient time? Each party should take this at their own pace. She scorched the earth/their life for years. This will take time. Ya don't flip a light switch and all is OK.", "NTA\n\nBecause right now it IS a no. I think you are reading into the situation a little bit with a big ol pair of rose colored glasses. Yes it's 3 months, but that's not a lot of time to get to know someone when and they presumably work fulltime and have responsibilities outside of the home. If they spend time together every weekend until Thanksgiving, that's still only twelve (12) visits to rebuild a relationship that has been dead for 8 years.  It's unreasonable and my answer would be no as well.\n\nIf the sister actually tried to make amends - like an apology - then maybe they would open the door to more. But you ignore then fact that the sister has traipsed back into their lives and has made no attempt to fix the damage she caused in her youth and expects things to go back to \"normal\" - like being invited to family events. Good for her for getting her life on track. But screw her if she thinks she deserves any special consideration until she has earned it. \n\nI don't know your life and don't want to presume. But your post smacks of \"But family....\" Family doesn't mean you are forgiven for anything. Being family doesn't mean you get to be terrible and abusive and then get welcomed back into the fold with open arms. Family means literally nothing when there is 18 years of hurt behind it. People with stable families never seem to grasp that because everyone involved is stable and looking out for each other. This is not that kind of case. \n\nThe sister clearly thinks she did nothing wrong while attacking OP for being a \"golden child\" when all being the \"golden child\" meant was that she wasn't punished constantly because unlike the sister, she wasn't causing problems constantly. It smacks of a massive lack of self-reflection and strongly hints that the sister is just older and less willing to take her hits in her older age but not fundamentally changed in how she sees the world and her place in it. That doubly means I wouldn't invite her to Thanksgiving either.", "10 years have passed, she's an actual stranger. \n\nYour  parents  have  every right to limit her access  until they feel  they  can trust her  again,  what you said  in  response  to her  rant was  the truth, and justified.\n\nPeople need  to be faced  with the  truth that  their  past  actions  have  consequences. She  should  have  apologised  to everyone, and be  working on trying to reconcile things.\n\nSeems  like  she  hasn't  realised  that nor  understands  how badly she  burned  her bridges.\n\nNTA  OP", "She isn't expecting open arms though... she's talking about dinner for a couple of hours several months from now.", "Not definitively, but certainly enough to have the possibility. It's a dinner for a couple of hours, not moving in.", "Thanksgiving dinner can, depending on the family, be a several hours family visit, but it also includes allowing her open access to their home. They may not trust her not to damage or steal things when people are too distracted by cooking or hosting to watch someone for 2+ hours.", "Sure, and in November they may decide they don't trust her yet, or that they only want her to come over just before dinner. However, they're already blocking off even the possibility.\n\nOP doesn't offer a reason to believe she would steal or anything else significant. She says her sister was a troubled kid but has her life together now and wants to reconnect with her family. Lots of people are brats as teenagers and grow up just fine, although their families usually don't give up on them. The Prodigal Son is a parable for a reason.", "Ummmm we are worried she would steal since she has done it before. She wasn\u2019t just a brat she was awful. She would fight people, she would destroy things, she would yell and call people disgusting names. She would fine anything you liked and fuck it up for you. She threw ever help back in the parents faces. She cursed me out at group therapy since I said her yelling makes it hard for us to have a good relationship.\n\nShe destroy my moms wedding dress since she told her no to an events.\n\nShe was awful"]}
