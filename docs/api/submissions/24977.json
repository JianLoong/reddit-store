My husband had made plans earlier this week to go out tonight for some beers with his buddies. Today my son came down with fever and cold symptoms. Nothing serious but he has been pretty miserable all day and needing lots of extra attention. He's been asking for his dad (who was at work) all day and going to the back door looking for him. \n\nI kept my husband updated on my sons illness developing throughout the day and figured he would reschedule his plans to stay home with me and our sick son. \n\nHe came home assuming he would still go out for beers. I told him it would never cross my mind to go out drinking with my girls if my baby was sick and that I didn't think he should go and honestly the fact that he didn't think that gave me the ick a little bit.\n\nHe ultimately decided to stay home but now that we have gotten our son to bed he has expressed how mad at me he is.

Not cool.", "NAH but you could have communicated better. When you were updating your husband, you should have said \u201ckiddo misses you and is asking for you, let\u2019s stay home tonight?\u201d Instead, you assumed. To him, it must have felt very last minute and I can understand why he was annoyed.", "YTA. You admit it being easily managed/not that sick AND him not getting to go out much. What was the harm in letting him have one night, or even just get the kid settled and then go out afterwards", "YTA. You were able to take care of him all day while your husband was at work. You really couldn\u2019t take care of him for a few extra hours while your husband went out?", "YTA\n\nPlease stop saying ick. You\u2019re an adult.", "There is no reason he couldn\u2019t have just spent 15 min cuddling with the kid and then go with his friends. It\u2019s important for adults to get time away too. You yourself said it\u2019s rare. It\u2019s not like the kid was deathly ill.", "The excuse, our son is sick.   Weak as Water.  The child wasn't that sick.  It sounds like you just didn't want him going out.", "I'm split, I want to say YTA for the approach but NTA for the intent . I do very much understand where you were coming from, but think that you could have communicated it better as another comment said. It's all about finding the compromises and finding ways for it to work for both of you. Like him going out after the kid had gone to bed, or something like that.\n\nThis is only if what your son had was not serious, and just was light symptoms of course.", "YTA. As you say, neither of you get to go out much and you get very excited when you can. He had plans with friends. Why not ask him to come home to spend time with your son for awhile, and then let him go and keep his plans with his friends? Your son wasn\u2019t so ill that two of you needed to be there all night with him, right? If you had had plans with your friends, wouldn\u2019t you let your husband stay with your son and go out, keeping in touch in case anything worsened? If he would have stayed home and let you go if the roles were reversed, then you should have let him go. You each need time out (a few hours) once in a while and need to keep up your friendships. You can\u2019t always be doing everything together. It\u2019s claustrophobic. \u201cTeam players\u201d need to be both of you compromising so the other can have friends; both obviously putting your child first, but giving each other those opportunities for small moments with friends when possible.", "You\u2019re a bit of both. You handled it poorly. Had you told him your son misses him during the day and that he wanted to spend a little time with him before he went out would have been a lot better. Being parents and partners you need to compromise. Could\u2019ve asked him to go a little bit later so he could\u2019ve spent some time with the little one and still not miss out on going out with friends", "NTA - Children always come first when it comes to parenting, *especially* when the child is sick. It's extremely disappointing that your husband cares more about hanging out with his friends than tending to his own sick child. Poor kid.", "Tbh the situation needs more info. And I'm biased on it since my daughter was sick with her first infection after starring daycare (she's fine now tho)\n\nLike for example. Did yall have one vehicle? In case that his fever could effect him badly, you have a way to get him to the ER? Was this situation delt with before sickness wise and you are prepped to not go into the store for medicine? \n\nTbh anything could happen, sacrifices have to be made at times, but it's worth knowing your infant/toddler is gonna get better. My husband and I called in work because my daughter has a recurring fever but it passed quickly enough in a matter of 2 days and kept the temp down moderately with medicine and cold rags lol.", "NTA. It may have been different except your son continuously asked for his father. He probably was able to go to sleep because \u201cdaddy\u201d was home and it made him happy. Whatever you do don\u2019t lay on the guilt just tell him his son was miserable all day and your husband made him feel better by just being home for him. Tell your husband if your son hadn\u2019t wanted his daddy so much that you would have handled it on your own.", "I'm mixed on this one...\n\nYTA for not handling this with your son better. Make your husband take the entire weekend day with your son to make up for the night out.\n\nHe's the asshole for getting mad afterwards. He should have been much appreciative and supportive.", "NTA as I know how hard sick kids can be on your own, but I would have given a compromise, to wait until your son had gone to bed, then he could meet with his mates.", "NTA. \n\nHe's the one who not being the team player \ud83d\ude44\n\nLet's see.... relieve the partner who's been home with a sick kid? Or go out for beers?\n\nI mean, I can see the appeal of the beers, but.....\n\n\ud83e\udd28", "Yeah, your husband does NOT understand his role in his family.  NTA.", "NTA.
