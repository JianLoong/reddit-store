It's my last year of middle school, so I was extremely happy to get in. My parents were happy for me too, since it's difficult to get in. My director recently told everyone that we have the opportunity to perform at a huge hockey game. I've never gotten this opportunity before, so of course I was excited hearing this.\n\nHe told us that our family would have to buy tickets to be able to come, and I knew my parents wouldn't want to do that. Last time this kind of thing happened (I was able to perform at my high schools football game), they didn't want to buy tickets, so I couldn't go.\n\nI told my mom about the hockey game once I came home, rambling about it for a while. She told me that she didn't want to go to a hockey game and refused to buy tickets. I didn't argue against her, and told her it was fine and that maybe my dad can go. She almost seemed offended, saying that there was no way he would want to go either.\n\nOnce my dad got home, I asked him about it. He said he didn't really want to go either, and asked if parents *had* to go for me to be able to perform. I said I didn't know, because we don't have much information yet.\n\nI'm hurt because this is a huge opportunity for me, and I want to prove to them how good I've gotten at my instrument. But I see where they're coming from. It's probably a lot of money for tickets and they don't even watch hockey. AITA for being angry at them?\n\nedit: I've looked up the prices, tickets are roughly between 40 - 150 dollars. Wide range, I know. It was the best answer I could find. The seats all the way up front are well over $150, about $400. But knowing they won't watch the game means they probably don't need great seats anyway.", "created_utc": 1667603742, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymdj8i/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_parents_for_not_wanting/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Talk to your band director, I'm sure you'll be able to go as long as they sign a permission slip. For my chorus/band trips, parents didn't HAVE to show up, though it was considered awesome if they did.", "NTA / NAH (No Assholes Here), but it\u2019s also not right that parents may have to buy tickets for their kids to be able to perform.  That makes this less of an honor and more of a way to manipulate people to buy tickets for events they otherwise wouldn\u2019t go to.  These kinds of tickets can be extremely expensive, and it can come down to a few hockey tickets or paying the electric bill.\n\nYou say that, if they\u2019re not watching the game, they don\u2019t need great seats.  Hate to tell you, but if they\u2019re in bad seats, they wouldn\u2019t be able to see you clearly anyway, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019d be able to pick out which notes you were the one playing.  So they\u2019d kinda need close seats to at least be able to keep their eyes on you.  $80-$300 just to be in the building, up to $800 to sit close, is really a lot of money.  If you can\u2019t understand this, then you ARE an AH.  You\u2019re not or being upset that they may have to miss this, but will be if you\u2019re going to keep being pissy that they aren\u2019t willing to spend potentially several hundred dollars.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
