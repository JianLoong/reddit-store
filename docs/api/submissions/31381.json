We were each others maid of honor at our weddings & our husbands are close friends now too. We have regularly gone out for double dates (even triple dates w/ our brother & his fianc\u00e9e) for years. \n\nMy sister & I both got pregnant around the same time - this wasn\u2019t planned, tho some family members don\u2019t believe us. We got even closer through our pregnancies if that was at all possible. I was due in early Nov, she in early Dec. \n\nSadly, 3 weeks ago, at 39 weeks - I stopped feeling any movement from my baby. After my husband rushed me to the hospital, we found out our baby had passed away. We\u2019re still not sure why - my pregnancy was pretty normal & all scans were developmentally appropriate - we are paying for an autopsy though have still not received the full report back. We have an appointment w/ our OBGYN to explain the results the week after Thanksgiving & we\u2019ll have a memorial service for him after the holidays. \n\nMy sister gave birth a few weeks early about 10 days ago - we knew she was high risk of early labor. She now has a beautiful healthy baby girl & while I am filled with so much joy for her, I am also still so heartbroken because we should\u2019ve both been holding our babies this holiday season. In an effort to still be supportive, my husband & I prepaid for a 1yr diaper service - we both talked about wanting to do cloth diapering (she had cloth diapers on her registry) & I thought this would take a huge load off her in the first year. I also sent a bouquet of flowers & my husband dropped off a load of diapers at their house before they got home from the hospital. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be supportive as best I can but I still cry every day after holding my still child in my arms just a few short weeks ago. Despite everything, my parents, sister, BIL, brother, & fianc\u00e9e still expect my husband & I to attend thanksgiving. I\u2018ve tried to explain that I know I\u2019m not ready to be around a baby without launching into hysterics - which would undoubtedly ruin the holiday mood. I have started working on my grief with my therapist but I don\u2019t get an appointment this week due to the holiday & I just haven\u2019t made that much progress yet. My explanations seem to fall on deaf ears. Are we assholes for not wanting to attend thanksgiving?", "created_utc": 1700524802, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18036tr/aita_for_not_attending_thanksgivingmeeting_my_new/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if there were no baby at the Thanksgiving event, it would be perfectly reasonable for you to stay home. Honestly, right now, **whatever you want** is what is best. If you felt compelled to be with a baby, that would be best. If you you know that will hurt, then staying away is best. \n\nPut your husband in charge of saying \"no\", and you and him together can be in charge of figuring out what's best for the two of you.", "Absolutely NTA.

You\u2019re still healing physically and mentally!", "Having experienced the same tragic event I can tell you to be good to yourself.  You need it they don't Ignore their attempts to sweep your babies passing under the carpet Just take care of yourself and daddy", "NAH/NTA -- they aren't AHs for inviting you, but refusing to let you say no is AH territory.  I don't blame you for not being up to it!  Your niece is too young to notice your absence; your sister and BIL have family support.  It's possible they're pressuring you out of misguided optimism, rather than any AHish intent?\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "Sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA and I am so sorry for your loss. If I were then I would cancel thanksgiving and spend time comforting you instead; you and your husband  went through one of the most difficult and painful experiences imaginable, my deepest condolences", "NTA. It\u2019s perfectly understandable (or ought to be.) \n\nI\u2019d give your family more of a general, \u201cwe\u2019re just not in a holiday mood\u201d which is true. If they push, just tell them \u201csorry\u201d and leave it at that.", "NTA\n\nI'm so terribly sorry for your loss. You need to do what is best for you and I'm on your side in thinking that you need to sit this holiday out. I'd like to think your family are coming from a place of love with their invitation but I'm really bothered by them not accepting your \"No thank you I'm not ready\" as an answer. Why would you ever regret missing your niece's first holiday when you are grieving your very recent loss of your own newborn child? Of course you won't!! You need to protect yourself and they need to let up on you. Can you get your husband to tell them that you don't want to hear any more about this Thanksgiving and that they need to put themselves in your shoes and learn to support you properly? I mean, he shouldn't have to, he is also grieving himself, but can he? Sending you so much love x", "Nta don\u2019t go", "NTA. Grieving people are excused from holiday parties.", "NTA but instead of telling them that you can't be there because of your niece just tell them you are still ill and in pain medically and you are unable to attend.  Just wait until the day of so they can't browbeat you into attending.", "NtA you doing everything possible to be supportive and trying to get over your grief I completely understand so don\u2019t feel bad I recommend to send a picture this all Reddit comment of our opinions about yours situation to your sister and bil and mother father that they can see they are in the wrong", "NTA, it's too bad your family isn't more supportive and understanding as you go through this awful time.", "NTA. I feel for you, and I know it's hard, probably even harder with the holidays here. I want you to understand that your feelings are 100% valid. Give yourself time and grace, and make sure you are taking care of yourself. Im sure your sister understands.", "NTA, I am so sorry for your loss. Take all the time you need. It\u2019s a shame that your family doesn\u2019t understand that you\u2019re grieving", "NAH your family could well think it is in your best interests. They mistake the situation", "Of course you\u2019re NTA, but it\u2019s okay to let them think you are. A person can only handle so much emotionally at any given time, so you have to focus on yourself and your well-being right now. Everything else is meaningless noise. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, grief takes time. I am so sorry for your loss. Everyone else will have to get over you not attending this year.", "NTA.  I am so sorry you have had this loss and your family is so very unsupportive.  Take all the time you need and ignore the people that say you are selfish.", "NTA to the power of a gazillion!!!!! To the moon and back!!! You do what you gotta do baby girl!!! That's a horrendous thing to go thru omfg you call all the shots at every step of the way!!! My gawd, after a 12 week along miscarriage I was still thrown into tears just hearing about my friends' pregnancies let alone them having the babies. Lord. No one can judge you or know and anyone who does has a black heart.", "Just from the title, NTA. Even if it was almost a month ago, having a stillborn baby is a traumatic event", "NTA.\n\nIt's perfectly ok to look them in the eye and say, \"We are not up for this. We are grieving. We need your grace and love and support, so accept our answer. Stop pressuring us to attend. We are not ready.\"\n\nAnd if they push, \"We've already discussed this, I'm hanging up now.\" Wash, rinse, repeat.", "Nta that\u2019s horrible that you\u2019re going through this and your family isn\u2019t being supportive with the grief being so fresh. You have to stop looking for permission to grieve the way you want and just say no. You don\u2019t need their agreement or buy in. This is a time to heal and you can\u2019t care about them more than yourself right now.", "OP there is another post that's popular on here today about someone struggling with infertility and not wanting to meet their nibling at Thanksgiving, and I just want to advise you to NOT read that post or the comments as your situations are entirely different. \n\nSecondly, I am so so sorry, OP. I'm aware I'm a stranger on the internet but I am so sad for you and your husband x There is a lot of advice online about learning to live with your grief, and how you cannot forget to live your life because you're mourning the one that never started, and I do honestly suggest you read them but right now? \n\nFuck thanksgiving. Don't go. \n\nSpend time with your husband, make little memories of your son; did you have a baby blanket for him? You can have it turned into a teddy so he's always with you if you think it might bring you comfort to hold. Tell your families you are in pain, you are bleeding and it's okay to be honest and say if it would hurt you to be around a baby right now. They want you there because they're not living your reality, but don't be afraid to remind them of that. \n\nGod OP I'm just so sorry for you. When my grandfather passed away, someone said to me to remember every lovely moment I had with him. Because when the pain came back so would those memories, and whilst the sadness might not ever lessen or heal I'd remember everything he meant to me and it would make me keep going. That's always stuck with me. Remember every little bit that made you smile, and know that when you remember him he is with you. No one is ever truly gone, they live on through the stories we tell. \n\nThank you for sharing a little piece of your son with us. I will keep you and yours in my heart x", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Even if she has not had a child, I still think you would be justified not to attend.  Simply because you are grieving and your heart is not into forcing yourself to be normal, much less celebrating anything.  This is a gut wrenching, heart shattering loss. It will take you a lot of time and help to get to even having some semblance of normalcy. \n\nCall or text your sister so she knows how happy you are for her, but that you are just not up for seeing people right now. And then go LC for the next week or so.  If he is up to it, have your husband field your calls and messages, but do not feel obligated to respond. Ultimately, it is for others to understand your grief and your reason for not attending; you really should not have to explain, much less convince.  You are not up for going - that\u2019s your decision and it stops there. \n\nSo very sorry for your loss. Wishing you the space to heal at your own pace.", "NTA.

The best you can do is apologize and explain that you want to recover, both medically and emotionally since it took so much out of you. \n\nI don't want to pry into personal business, but why would your explanation fall on deaf ears when you spoke of your wishes?", "Absolutely NTA you're grieving and healing from a very recent traumatic experience.

Your loss is so fresh and deep\u2026not easy, I bet, even to write this. \n\nYou are fortunate in one terrible way: You know and can articulate exactly where you are\u2014and what you\u2019re not up to-emotionally. \n\nAll anyone can ever do is their best, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing, very thoughtfully.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry; this I just cannot do.

She asked if my husband & I wanted them to come to the hospital & we\u2019re kind when we told her we didn\u2019t - we didn\u2019t want anyone to come, even though the hospital told us we could invite family to say goodbye as well, it was just too horrible to share. I didn\u2019t want my family to see my son that way. (We also asked my husbands family not to come too - they are lovely & have been very supportive - so it\u2019s not like we only excluded my family. We were the only two who got to hold/see him.) I still don\u2019t know if this was the right decision - I just didn\u2019t want to put my sister through that or terrify her when she was so close to the end of her own high-risk pregnancy. It didn\u2019t seem fair to spoil the end of her pregnancy with stress and fear that it could happen to her (I know she was scared enough before). She sent flowers, texted me every day just to tell me she loves me, came to visit me and held me while I cried, organized a roster of our friends/family to bring meals for the first week we were home from the hospital. It kind of stopped after her daughter was born but I expected that she\u2019d be busy/tired after that so I wasn\u2019t mad. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m so shocked that she\u2019s SO upset that I can\u2019t understand why I just can\u2019t be around it all yet.", "They keep telling me I\u2019ll regret missing niece\u2019s first holidays & thinking that being around my niece/holding her should be some sort of consolation prize. Like, I am SO happy for my sister, I really truly am - she and her husband were trying for 2 years and were starting to explore fertility options when they suddenly conceived. They have wanted this for awhile and they are gonna be such amazing parents. I\u2019m just\u2026 not able to have a firsthand account of the joy I\u2019m missing out on. At least not yet.", "That\u2019s a good idea; I had to have a C-section to deliver him so I am still recovering from major surgery. I haven\u2019t paid much attention to it I guess, but it\u2019s still an excuse. Thank you for the idea.", "This is a good response. I can't even imagine going through the holidays after something like this.", "I haven\u2019t seen her since her daughter was born, but she came over two days after I was home from the hospital and she held me while I cried, rubbed my back. I think maybe she\u2019s just a bit blinded by her joy/happiness and she wants to share it but maybe isn\u2019t going about it the right way.", "Though I\u2019ve explained my reasoning, my family keeps trying to cajole us into joining - citing things like needing to be around family, getting support from each other, we\u2019re all grieving my son but should all be able to celebrate my niece, maybe it would make me feel better, etc. My mom, for some reason, is the one being most insistent, that she was so looking forward to having all of us this holiday with the new generation - I\u2019m not sure she realizes that to husband and I, \u201call of us\u201d wouldn\u2019t be there because \u201call of us\u201d would\u2019ve included our son.", "Oh my. Tears for your beautiful angel. Words cannot properly express my deepest sympathy & heartbreak for both of you.\n\nNTA. You get to take care of you right now. The rest of them can be damned. You are to do whatever you can handle. Maybe next Thanksgiving & Christmas. But not this year. Now is a time to treat yourself with love and compassion as you (and your partner) heal from this terrible tragedy. Don't listen to anyone else.\n\nI do hope you get some answers. The why of what happened.", "Some of the kindest, most supportive and good intentioned people were the ones who also said the most cluelessly inappropriate things when I was in your shoes. Empathy only goes so far with situations you have no way of understanding. I was released through the labor and delivery entrance of the hospital and sat there with empty arms, crying as the other new parents were gleefully headed home with their perfect new babies. I was headed to the funeral home to decide what to do with her body. To go from planning a baby shower to planning a funeral screws up your headspace for longer than a month. Take all the time you need. Solid NTA and my heart goes out to you.", "Even though your sisters outcome was different; she likely still feels your loss in her heart and in the pit of her stomach. You have gone through every mother's worst nightmare. \n\nYour comments show she loves you, and I think she is just trying to make it right in any way she can. Now, her actions are misguided, for whatever the reason, but I think she is trying to help without knowing", "Gosh those people r idiots", "Yeah I had a feeling part of it was \"our new LO is so delightful that she will make up for not having one of your own\" which is ... insensitive?  And maybe there's some attempt to deliberately include you with your grief, but there's a difference between \"we want you here even if you're visibly sad\" and \"we demand you come\".\n\nJust keep to your own boundaries (\"just\", I say, like it's easy).  That you are not up to it this year, that everything is overwhelming at the moment, that you want everyone's memories of niece's first Thanksgiving to be about her.  \n\nYou're making the right call for yourselves.  Trust yourselves.", "My grandson was born 2 days before mother's day, he passed 36 hours later (last year, 2022).   Shit like that gives you perspective on grief.\n\nOP, protect your peace & your heart. You don't need permission. \u2665\ufe0f", "Stand your ground and give your reason, again. Family is important, but timing to grieve is also important. When you see your therapist or perhaps contact someone close to you, discuss how you feel about your family's insistence of you joining Thanksgiving. It's not healthy for a family to put pressure on you while you grieve the loss of your own baby. \n\nPerhaps have a talk with your family openly and tell them you don't feel well enough to celebrate a new life. You want to find peace after death, but it does take time."]}
