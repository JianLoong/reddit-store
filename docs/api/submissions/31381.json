We were each others maid of honor at our weddings & our husbands are close friends now too. We have regularly gone out for double dates (even triple dates w/ our brother & his fianc\u00e9e) for years. \n\nMy sister & I both got pregnant around the same time - this wasn\u2019t planned, tho some family members don\u2019t believe us. We got even closer through our pregnancies if that was at all possible. I was due in early Nov, she in early Dec. \n\nSadly, 3 weeks ago, at 39 weeks - I stopped feeling any movement from my baby. After my husband rushed me to the hospital, we found out our baby had passed away. We\u2019re still not sure why - my pregnancy was pretty normal & all scans were developmentally appropriate - we are paying for an autopsy though have still not received the full report back. We have an appointment w/ our OBGYN to explain the results the week after Thanksgiving & we\u2019ll have a memorial service for him after the holidays. \n\nMy sister gave birth a few weeks early about 10 days ago - we knew she was high risk of early labor. She now has a beautiful healthy baby girl & while I am filled with so much joy for her, I am also still so heartbroken because we should\u2019ve both been holding our babies this holiday season. In an effort to still be supportive, my husband & I prepaid for a 1yr diaper service - we both talked about wanting to do cloth diapering (she had cloth diapers on her registry) & I thought this would take a huge load off her in the first year. I also sent a bouquet of flowers & my husband dropped off a load of diapers at their house before they got home from the hospital. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be supportive as best I can but I still cry every day after holding my still child in my arms just a few short weeks ago. Despite everything, my parents, sister, BIL, brother, & fianc\u00e9e still expect my husband & I to attend thanksgiving. I\u2018ve tried to explain that I know I\u2019m not ready to be around a baby without launching into hysterics - which would undoubtedly ruin the holiday mood. I have started working on my grief with my therapist but I don\u2019t get an appointment this week due to the holiday & I just haven\u2019t made that much progress yet. My explanations seem to fall on deaf ears.

I'd like to think your family are coming from a place of love with their invitation but I'm really bothered by them not accepting your \"No thank you I'm not ready\" as an answer. Why would you ever regret missing your niece's first holiday when you are grieving your very recent loss of your own newborn child? Of course you won't!! You need to protect yourself and they need to let up on you. Can you get your husband to tell them that you don't want to hear any more about this Thanksgiving and that they need to put themselves in your shoes and learn to support you properly?

This is a time to heal and you can\u2019t care about them more than yourself right now.", "OP there is another post that's popular on here today about someone struggling with infertility and not wanting to meet their nibling at Thanksgiving, and I just want to advise you to NOT read that post or the comments as your situations are entirely different. \n\nSecondly, I am so so sorry, OP. I'm aware I'm a stranger on the internet but I am so sad for you and your husband x There is a lot of advice online about learning to live with your grief, and how you cannot forget to live your life because you're mourning the one that never started, and I do honestly suggest you read them but right now? \n\nFuck thanksgiving. Don't go. \n\nSpend time with your husband, make little memories of your son; did you have a baby blanket for him? You can have it turned into a teddy so he's always with you if you think it might bring you comfort to hold. Tell your families you are in pain, you are bleeding and it's okay to be honest and say if it would hurt you to be around a baby right now. They want you there because they're not living your reality, but don't be afraid to remind them of that. \n\nGod OP I'm just so sorry for you. When my grandfather passed away, someone said to me to remember every lovely moment I had with him. Because when the pain came back so would those memories, and whilst the sadness might not ever lessen or heal I'd remember everything he meant to me and it would make me keep going. That's always stuck with me. Remember every little bit that made you smile, and know that when you remember him he is with you. No one is ever truly gone, they live on through the stories we tell. \n\nThank you for sharing a little piece of your son with us.

I didn\u2019t want my family to see my son that way.

I still don\u2019t know if this was the right decision - I just didn\u2019t want to put my sister through that or terrify her when she was so close to the end of her own high-risk pregnancy. It didn\u2019t seem fair to spoil the end of her pregnancy with stress and fear that it could happen to her (I know she was scared enough before). She sent flowers, texted me every day just to tell me she loves me, came to visit me and held me while I cried, organized a roster of our friends/family to bring meals for the first week we were home from the hospital. It kind of stopped after her daughter was born but I expected that she\u2019d be busy/tired after that so I wasn\u2019t mad.

I lost my son 4 weeks ago now in the evening after his delivery due to complications during the birth. I\u2019m fortunate that my aunt is a social worker who deals specifically with parents who have lost children (among other fertility related issues). She has coached my family on what to do and what not to do. My brother has assured me that he will make enough food for my husband and I, but if we decide not to attend Thursday morning, it is totally okay and he will bring some leftovers to us.\n\nMy husband\u2019s family is doing similar things to your family. They think we should reconsider where we\u2019re spending Thanksgiving and that we should spend time with our nieces and nephew and see my pregnant sister in law. I am convinced if I had to do this, I would have a nervous breakdown and have to be hospitalized again.\n\nThis is a grief that many people never have to experience and cannot possibly fathom. I am so sorry your family is being so\u2026 not understanding.

I hope that in time, your family understands that you needed to do this. And I wish you and your husband well, I am so sorry for your loss :(", "NTA- while this is not the same as a stillbirth I lost my oldest son when he was 5 months old. I couldn\u2019t be around babies at all until my rainbow baby was born 14 months after we lost him, but before that? I\u2019d leave Walmart without buying anything in my cart if I saw a baby under a year. I\u2019d drop it and leave, I could not imagine what it would\u2019ve been like if another family member had a baby in that time, luckily I\u2019m the only adult grandchild and 3/5 haven\u2019t even gone through puberty. Your family needs to understand how traumatic it would be to see a healthy newborn at this time and that if they want to support you the best thing is for your parents to come over with leftovers alone and either drop it off or if you\u2019re okay with it they can come in and help you. Definitely use the C-section recovery as an excuse, but if they take mental health seriously maybe make a group message where you explain that while you love your niece and you\u2019re so happy for your sister you and your husband are on a very thin rope mentally and that being there at this moment might push you both off the ledge where you\u2019ll need immediate mental intervention. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re being malicious it\u2019s just extremely difficult to understand unless someone goes through it and you of course don\u2019t want anyone else to go through it. \n\nI\u2019m so so sorry for your loss", "NTA.

I worked at a pediatrician office and my job was primarily with newborns and their parents. It was so hard to go back. But I was surrounded even at work by people who loved me. I broke down many times. I do know your pain. I know people try to not talk about it when a baby dies like we will forget or something when all I ever want is for others to remember her. I know this for you is so new and raw. It\u2019s hard because as a newborn we had not just the heartbreak but our hopes and dreams for our children were torn away. People shy away from talking about lost babies. They don\u2019t understand that we want others to say their name and remember. I would be like you. You don\u2019t want to take away from your sisters joy and you cannot enjoy this with her right now.  Talk to your sister. I\u2019m sure she feels your pain also and doesn\u2019t know what to do to help you. Just talk to her and tell her your pain is so hard that you just can\u2019t this week.

I tried to think how nice it was that I was there with my Mom, but all I could think about was my own loss, and I started crying.

A few days to a week or so before whichever days you celebrate together, set up a game plan with the hosts or whoever else you think would be your best support team. Things like if you start to feel like you\u2019ll break down crying, give a subtle signal to your husband or your mother (either letting them know to let you be alone or that you want their company and comfort) and excuse yourself from the room to somewhere you can let the wave of emotion roll over you, give yourself a moment to honor your son, and then rejoin the group. Or ask the group to set aside a moment for you to light a candle for him and have a moment of silence where you can focus your love on your lost child. Your whole family lost him, and even though their loss is completely different than yours, they might appreciate an opportunity to feel him there, too, as long as the majority of the family time can still be about joy. It sounds like from your description of your sister relationship, you WILL regret it as they predict if you entirely miss your niece\u2019s first holiday season. I think there are a lot of ways you can be true to your grief, be present with your family, AND leave room for joy and happy memories for the future. But skipping Thanksgiving is self-care. Give this one to yourself.", "My dear, sweet friend...NTA. No one gets to tell you how to grieve. You've suffered the death of your child. RECENTLY! It's perfectly acceptable to need some space.

Your family may be feeling guilty because they\u2019re happy at your niece\u2019s birth and don\u2019t want you to be sad. But you can be both happy and sad. Many people don\u2019t count miscarriages as \u201creal\u201d deaths but a stillbirth at 39 weeks is a major loss. I\u2019m so sorry. It will take time, that\u2019s all, and the holidays are happening right now so the timing is terrible but \u201c1st Thanksgiving\u201d is not a thing to be concerned about. I\u2019m sorry your family doesn\u2019t get it.", "NTA. If you get far enough down the list to read this, please don't put yourself through baby meeting and holiday craziness at the same time. I used to be a social worker supporting women through stillbirth and a fresh baby Thanksgiving is the worst possible thing you could do to yourself. \n\nTake care of you and I'm sorry for your loss. You didn't stop being a mom when your baby died, you can love your niece without loving your baby any less, and your niece will not ever give a shit that her auntie did self care instead of melting down during a holiday she doesn't remember. \n\nOn a day that you feel stronger, take a cab or an Uber to your sister's so you can hold each other and the baby and ugly cry together and not have to drive home. I advise tucking a small bottle of wine in your purse and having a therapy appointment pre-booked for the day after. That day may come sooner than you think, or it may not. Either is okay.", "NTA.

But OP and I feel differently. We are so happy for \\[sister and BIL\\] and look forward to lots of good times together as family.

When my husband opened the door to their townhome, I heard the baby cry and I stopped dead in my tracks and my face went blank. My husband turned around to see me tearing up and I looked at him and whispered that I don't think I can go in there after all. He huffed in a frustrated way and said to quit acting like that, today isn't about me. His words snapped me out of my stupor and I still went inside and met the baby, but I was still hurt and screamed at him when we were in the car going home that he doesn't get to dictate how I process my grief and if I couldn't go in, he shouldn't have made me feel like a child for not doing so.", "NTA.

And I think it's forgivable if you are blunt/harsh and maybe a even a little crass about why you can't do this holiday with your family. We often try to soften our refusals to avoid hurting other people's feelings and that makes people feel like they trample over your boundaries \"for your own good\". Right now, you and your feelings take priority over what they think is good for you.\n\nStand your ground and don't go.

But they don't need to understand or agree. And you don't have to keep asking for permission to take a break. Don't go. Tell everyone one last time that you're not going to be there, you understandthey're disappointed but you're doing what you need to do and you won't discuss it anymore, and you both hope they all have a lovely time.

You are still healing physically too; a few weeks isn\u2019t enough healing time. Christmas is just around the corner, so this situation will soon be repeating itself, in all likelihood. Maybe you will feel more like gathering at that time for a more subdued observance this year. If not, I also understand that. For those who have not been through this loss, it is difficult to comprehend how profound it is. Our first child was born prematurely and did not survive because of his prematurity. Some well meaning friends and family said the most inane things, but now, nearly 38 years later, I realize they didn\u2019t really know the depth of our loss and how insensitive they sounded. Hugs to you.", "You are all grieving. I\u2019m so sorry. Try to remember that their intentions are good and motivated by love for you. Doesn\u2019t make them right, but perhaps it makes their emotional clumsiness easier to deal with.", "Send her a link to this thread.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. \n\nI\u2019m not shocked about your mom.\n\nYou know how people discuss the ring theory of grief? Well, joy has its own rings, that emanate downward and outwards, and it tends to be easier to publicize joy.\n\nSo, your sister is at the center of her joy and rings removed from your grief. She\u2019s not going to really get it. Your brother is removed equally for the grief and joy, but your sister\u2019s joy is more public and easier to embrace. \n\nYour mom, though, is the next level removed from both your grief and your sister\u2019s joy, but joy is more public \u2026 and the degree of removal from your grief means that your mom can take more comfort in your niece. \n\nYour mom is being stubbornly selfish but understandably so\u2014She\u2019s evaluating your grief and her grief and assuming that what worked for her and your family will work for your husband and you. She found a port in the storm, but that doesn\u2019t mean the port will work for you because your circumstances are different. She wasn\u2019t forced to see the physical reality of your loss (I am in no way criticizing you for that, to be very clear. I would have done the same thing), whereas she sees your niece. She wants you to be happy, so her combo of grief and joy is convincing her that her path is the right path for you. \n\nI think that you need to be brutally honest with your mom about your experience. I suspect that the Thanksgiving push is coming from her. Your mom needs that reminder that she isn\u2019t the center of your grief. \n\nYou are not all grieving your son to the same degree. That\u2019s normal, but your family seemingly needs a reminder of that reality.", "You should tell her that.", "OP, am I correct in my thought that *yours* is the first late-pregnancy loss and/or (known!) loss of a child your parents & siblings have experienced?\n\n'Cuz as someone who grew up with paternal grandparents who had both a stillborn son and one who died in childhood, *and* maternal grandparents who had a stillborn daughter (and some other miscarriages in multiple other generations following those!), your family's reaction *seems* \"well-intentioned but *severely* misguided\" honestly!\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc97\n\nYou have all my condolences, and I hope the holiday *season* goes as gently as possible on you & your husband\ud83d\udc9d\n\nDo whatever *you need to do* for Thanksgiving--and, frankly, for Christmas & New Years', too!\n\nIf you *feel* like celebrating, do that.\n\nAnd, *if you don't*, then *don't*, and refuse to feel ANY guilt or doubt about it!\n\nYou & your husband had a *major* loss, and you lost someone *you both* were incredibly close to.\n\nIt's *perfectly normal*, to NOT want to go to a big event, *and that is OKAY*!!!\n\nIt's *not* about your niece--it's about you and your husband losing someone you loved.\n\nI don't know if it would help any, to try and explain it to your mom or sister, to ask them to imagine how they'd be pushing if your husband's grandparent had passed three weeks ago--*or if they'd respect that you were sad* & simply not up to celebrating right now.  That it *really* isn't about your niece & any sort of bitterness, it *is* purely grief, sadness, and needing time & the grace to become less raw, wound-wise (both emotionally *and* physically!).\n\nTake care of you!

I\u2019m so happy your family supported you the way you deserve. \n\nOP, NTA. I\u2019m so deeply sorry. I cannot fathom the pain you are going through. I know you love your family, but they can f right off this time. Like others have said, keep your boundaries tight. It\u2019s ok to have your husband liaise for you. There\u2019s no need to talk to them right now. This time is for you and your husband to do whatever it is that brings you solace.\n\nEdited for grammar", "This is so poignant.

It's crucial to set and maintain boundaries, especially during challenging times. Grieving is a personal process, and everyone copes differently. Communicating your feelings and needs is essential, and true friends will understand and respect your decisions.

That decision was super hard for me. More kids would not be good for me, but I want them anyway. Very unexpectedly discovered I was pregnant mid December. Miscarriage was confirmed by ultrasound and blood test shortly before Christmas. We still had shopping to do. Watching my mother cooing over all the babies in prams while I was actively bleeding mine away was one of the hardest experiences of my life. I can't even imagine what you've gone through.", "My nieces first Xmas was exciting for us. But it was fairly boring. \n\nXmas as a 6 year old?

My mom didn't after she had me and a decade later needed a hysterectomy.", "It shouldn\u2019t be harder to argue that but sadly people think you should be able to gratitude journal yourself out of emotional pain.", "What a horrible painful reminder every time you move too, recovery pain just kicking you when you\u2019re so down. Ugh my heart hurts for op honestly idk how her family can just be like so what.", "She should not have to keep \u201cgiving a reason\u201d. She doesn\u2019t owe them an explanation.", "Going to semi piggy back off of this. My first thought was OPs mom is worried about this possibly being the last holiday with her kids. I mean OP herself said her pregnancy was seemingly normal. I wonder if this kinda put things into perspective that not everyday is certain & OPs mom just isn\u2019t expressing it the right way. I\u2019m going with NAH because I think they have good intentions but aren\u2019t expressing it in the correct way.", "Yep like \u201cshe\u2019s in a better place now \u201c. That\u2019s a load of horse poo. What better place than their parents arms?", "If you haven\u2019t gone through it, you just don\u2019t know.", "I wonder if the sister just feels guilty that she has a living child with OP\u2019s immense loss and is trying to overcompensate for it. I do think the sister is coming from a place of love and is just misguided in her approach on how to handle it. I would respect wishes of course, but I would still worry that I wasn\u2019t doing the right thing to support my loved one in the time of such a loss.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.

You don\u2019t owe anyone anything.", "A truly compassionate friend or family member would offer to bring plates of traditional fare to you and yours and sit quietly with you for at least part of the day, so you wouldn\u2019t feel excluded or forgotten. \n\n Is there anyone you could ask to do this?  Or perhaps your husband could order in meals for the holiday weekend, since a lot of restaurants will be closed?", "Who? My mom? No, lol. Moved out at 26, and been gone since.\n\nMind you, I was.. shit. Oh fuck, *barely turned* 21 during that year, which I refer to as my Year of Miscarriages and Loss.\n\nWhy it breaks my heart when seeing posts like OP, asking if they're an asshole for feeling this way. I just wanna give them a giant hug, some fuzzy blankets, lots of tissues, and hold their hand while they cry, scream, rage. Whatt the fuck ever they need, since I never had that kind of support.\n\nOP, maybe try any therapy groups centered around infant loss? Your local hospital may know, or possibly your therapist.\n\nI tried, but yea.. had to soldier on and continue helping raise my baby brother, so never really had time to properly grieve until years later.\n\nIt's a dull ache now. \n\nOP, if you ever feel the need?
