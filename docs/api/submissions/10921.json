We have a son who just turned six months old. Our relationship had previously been good however ever since my son was born my husband has started to snap at me over small things. I am a stay at home mum and he works as an accountant at a fairly large company. He works long hours and I understand that he is very stressed at the moment. He likes me to do almost all of the childcare and work around the house which is only fair considering I don\u2019t work. I have never minded this arrangement however there has been several times where he has yelled at me over things such as not having dinner ready on time. I understand his job is incredibly stressful but I really hate him talking to me this way. I have tried to explain this to him and he does always apologise afterwards explaining he had just had a bad day at work. \n\nThings came to a head today when I finally snapped. I cooked us both spaghetti bolognese for dinner but only realised after I had started putting the sauce together that we had ran out of spaghetti. I decided instead to use regular pasta assuming this would not be an issue. However, when I presented the meal to my husband this evening he flipped the plate over and started yelling taking me complete surprise. He called me a \u201cstupid bitch\u201d saying he didn\u2019t like regular pasta and that he had already had a hard day at work without coming home to a fucked up dinner. At this point I had enough I didn\u2019t even respond I just grabbed my son and immediately drove to my parents house. \n\nHe blew up my phone with calls but I didn\u2019t have the energy to answer. I messaged him later on explaining that I could no longer deal with his outbursts and if he didn\u2019t get it sorted out I didn\u2019t think we could continue being married. He then spammed me with calls and messaged apologising then telling me I was overreacting and to just come home. The last message he said was saying how he works so hard to provide for our family and I\u2019m throwing it back in his face tearing our family apart. My mother in law (who I have never gotten along with) also messaged me calling me a bitch for \u201ctaking his son\u201d. I feel terrible and don\u2019t know if I am overreacting or if I should actually follow through with leaving him. My parents both say I should leave him and I am completely in the right doing so but I\u2019m just so overwhelmed thinking about how it even got to this point. AITA for telling him I am considering leaving him and WIBTA for leaving him over this?\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the responses, it has helped me realise what I already knew deep down. I am going to speak to him over the phone and give him an ultimatum of going to both therapy and the doctors to see if there is an underlying reason he has suddenly started acting this way. If he gets help and can show he has changed I might return otherwise I\u2019m going to start the divorce proceedings and continue living with my parents (who have been amazing). Again, thank you so much everyone who has commented I can\u2019t respond to everyone right now but just know how much you all have helped.", "created_utc": 1677375890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11c23x0/aita_for_threatening_to_leave_my_husband_over_an/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't have an outburst over pasta. And please stop making excuses for him, you deserve better and are worth more than that. Unless he gets some serious help you need to protect you and your baby. It will only get worse.", "NTA. Your fight was about his hair trigger temper and how he is now treating you. \n\nTell him you will return when he gets anger management training and gets into therapy for whatever underlying issues  that have driven his nastiness since your son was born. And sees a doctor to make sure some underlying medical issue (brain tumor? Screwed up metabolism?) isn\u2019t causing this.", "NTA\n\nYou did not leave over pasta, you left because he\u2019s a controlling, abusing AH!\n\nI hate saying this, but run. Do whatever you have to do to get away from him. You are not safe and neither is your child. Remember, he\u2019s the example your son will see. Do you want your son to think that behavior is acceptable?", "NTA. You need to keep yourself and your child safe and this behavior is not okay. Unless he agrees to some serious counseling or anger management, you do not deserve to be treated this way.", "Run. Run fast, run far. He\u2019s a creeper and an abuser.

Getting angry over pasta is absurd - your husband has anger and mental health issues. \n\nYou did the right thing. You need to keep yourself and your family safe. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nAlmost everyone has bad days at work, even on most people's worst days at work it's not normal to come home and flip the plate over in a fit of rage. Something is off with him and his anger, and he absolutely had to deal with it. Until he starts taking it seriously I wouldn't move back with him, maybe you could consider going to couple therapy after he has done his own therapy. But you should not be putting up with this.", "This is only gonna get worse. You and your child deserve better. NTA", "Um, what. NTA.\n\nYour contributions to the household cannot be so casually dismissed, especially by yourself.", "INFO either you and the baby are his prized people in his life, or you are the maid and nanny.\n\nThat\u2019s it. \n\nHe has decided that his working outside the home is worth more than your full time work.\n\nFeel very proud that you immediately left with the baby.

His behaviour towards you is unacceptable. He and his mother are now gaslighting you by saying you are overreacting, and now he\u2019s blaming you!  This is what abusers do blame others and make excuses.  He\u2019s not taking any responsibility. I agree with your parents.  You should leave him before things get worse.  He can\u2019t change what he won\u2019t acknowledge.", "NTA, but I would definitely push for him to get help. A very large portion of the male population suffer from mental health.", "Responding to your edit, since there seems to be a consensus on the main post. It's extremely generous of you to give him the opportunity to see a therapist/doctor; I wouldn't have blamed you for leaving just based on the content of your main post. Please stay with your parents until he has been seen and demonstrated repeatable changed behavior. Don't subject yourself or your child to the pain and time it will take for him to change (if he does).", "NTA- his violent temper tantrum could be focused on your baby next.  Think about that . It\u2019s not about the pasta.  You didn\u2019t deserve that and you and your baby are not safe . Your mother in law did it witness him having a violent outburst. And she may also be part of the problem if she is always going to make excuses . I\u2019d be in contact with a domestic violence agency. Please take this seriously and do not let your husband and his family sweep this under the rug.", "Oh honey this is not about pasta. You should NEVER put up with someone treating you this way. Especially not around a child. Leave asap. Obviously NTA.", "He is also my son, I have only been gone for around 6 hours and couldn\u2019t leave him with my husband knowing he was that angry and acting irrationally.

That is NOT kidnapping.", "It suddenly changed once he trapped her with a child. It\u2019s a pretty common tactic of abusers.", "Excellent advice. It could be as simple as lacking a certain nutrient or as complex as a brain tumor. Medical conditions should be ruled out first - that is, if he's willing to get checked out by a doctor.", "I one had a similar reaction to pasta noodles (not flipping a plate kind you) I was full on crying- obviously this wasn\u2019t normal. Two days later I found out I was pregnant. \nIF this isn\u2019t normal behaviour I would have him schedule a drs appointment ASAP.

I mean obviously not the point of the story, but I am also wondering haha. I don\u2019t think referring to any type of pasta as \u201cregular\u201d is a thing.", "Politely disagree. Her giving him a second chance to abuse her is not a good or safe idea.

I can't stand men that behave that way and then blame it on outside interference. It sucks that you're in this position. I'm just saying, to be careful because actions like these can come back and bite you. You need to have a stern talk with him about your expectations. He should not treat you like an enemy, but rather as a companion who can help to de-stress him. I hope you guys can work it out. Good luck!", "Right. She can take him to the mall, or the park, or for a car ride. She can't take him to his mom's and keep the child away from his father.
