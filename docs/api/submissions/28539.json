Jane is, to put it bluntly, a hoarder. When I visited when she first moved in, the house was just a little cluttered, but now its straight up disgusting. The kitchen is completely unusable due to all the stuff, the front door is blocked by a mountain of garbage, there used to be cat feces lying around until I said something (also there might be a dead cat in the walls somewhere, not sure), and Jane's mother can't even sleep in her bed because its also covered in stuff. To be clear, all of these extra items belong solely to Jane. Whenever Jane's mother says anything about the house's condition, Jane gets annoyed and lashes out.\r  \n\r  \nOn top of this, Jane's mother clearly needs more care than just Jane. She needs help with things like bathing, trimming her toenails, and getting food to eat since she can't use the kitchen, Jane doesn't cook for her, and Jane sometimes eats the food I give her specifically for her mother to eat. \r  \n\r  \nI've tried helping Jane clean and declutter the house, but I haven't seen any sign of improvement. I've tried discussing the need for social services involvement or the possibility of putting her mother in a nursing home where she can receive proper care. Jane has rejected all these suggestions. She says her mother is fine, but she also says her mother would die if someone were to remove her from her home.\r  \n\r  \nWill I be the asshole if I call adult protective services? This will almost certainly ruin my friendship with Jane, but I'm more concerned that the mother really will die if APS deems the house unlivable and removes her from her home.
