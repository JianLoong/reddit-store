Nobody wants a doctor who cheated his way through med school.", "Nta what if there\u2019s something he needs to know for his patients down the road but he can\u2019t help them right because he cheated.", "NTA you went to him first!! \n\nYou can't make someone do something someone doesn't want to do! \n\nGood luck with your own exams !", "NTA. In some circumstances I might say \"no one likes a grass\", but this man is pursuing a career where he'll have people's lives in his hands, and I don't want someone who isn't legitimately qualified being allowed anywhere near any patients.", "NTA. If he needs to cheat his way through med school, I can't imagine that he would be a good doctor. Bad doctors cause harm to people. Your family is unreasonable. Do they really want him out there harming patients after cheating through school and not actually learning the job?", "NTA. Odds are your brother got his attitude about cheating from somewhere. You couldn\u2019t trust your family to handle it internally. \n\nYou protected a lot of future patients", "You know what they call doctors who cheat in med school?  \u201cDoctor\u201d.  NTA.", "NTA- your parents should be mad at him for cheating\u2026", "Definitely NTA. No one wants a doctor who cheated through med school.", "NTA. You confronted him about it first, and he has chosen a career path where him not having the right knowledge could have fatal consequences so you have done a good thing for society by reporting him.", "NTA, I think we'd all prefer it if our doctors didn't cheat in med school.", "NTA. All your brother's potential future patients thank you.", "NTA, your family on the other hand are all AHs.", "NTA\n\nIf he hasn't actually studied the material, he should not be in the medical field, where someone's life could literally depend on him knowing this stuff.", "What would happen if something happed to a patient because your brother cheated his way through?\n\nI feel like you have potentially saved  others.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You can tell your family you did handle in with him, and he ignored you.   He had his chance to fix it, and he blew it.  If you did nothing, people\u2019s lives could be affected down the road, no one should feel obligated to carry such a burden.", "NTA, someone\u2019s life could depend on your brother knowing whatever information was on the test he cheated on last week.", "Definitely NTA. I\u2019d say yta if it was regular school, but it\u2019s med school, which is\n\na) way harder\n\nand b) for people who are actually passionate enough about medicine to genuinely do their exams and not cheat.", "NTA.  Your parents need to grow up and realise your brothers actions caused his problems.  If the Med school had caught him without you reporting then you may have also been on the spotlight just because he is your brother.  Who would want medical treatment from someone who cheated rather than learned the work.", "Good for society, bad for family.  Which do you value more?\n\nCheaters always get caught eventually.", "I think cheating is common in many high level professionals (med school, law school, accounting). People just justify their cheating. But in the end career paths will be different.\nNTA, what your brother did was wrong, and in his mind he thinks cheating is okay. Hopefully this will be a wake up call for him and he starts applying himself.\nIn my profession people caught cheating are given another chance, so its not the end of the medical career.\n\nAnd sorry your parents reaction creates a culture where cheating isn't so bad as long as its kept within the family and no one knows. If you went to your parents your brother would have kept cheating because he didn't learn the lesson.\n\nThe family drama will die down. Just keep focused on your studies and strong values!", "U pulled a sixnine if i was ur brother me personally i aint letting that slide", "(Edit: dumb me totally misread it lol sorry)\n\nFirst of all sorry for my first vote, as I said I totally misread it and though you were waayyyy much younger idk why.\n\nSo. NTA. It's med school and you'll have the mifes of your patients in your hands. Cheating is easy but it's not a solution. Maybe you should've tell your parents first and let them scold your brother but as someone else said, you're both adults, so he should've been prepared to face the consequences of his choices and actions.", "YTA. You sound like the worst brother ever", "YTA. You ruined your brothers life. Could you not come up with a half measure or compromise?", "Oh my god YTA- you were just bitter because your brother was able to keep up academically without working as hard. Literally I hate people like you and I\u2019m guessing you have no friends\ud83d\udc80", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you did not think this through. What will you do when he says you were involved, and he did it together with you? They weill believe him, especially when he tells them you KNEW, and you reported him anonymously after you had a fight.
