Hopefully this will be a wake up call for him and he starts applying himself.\nIn my profession people caught cheating are given another chance, so its not the end of the medical career.\n\nAnd sorry your parents reaction creates a culture where cheating isn't so bad as long as its kept within the family and no one knows.

They should be proud of your integrity and the hard work which you have put into your studies, and disappointed in his dishonesty and laziness.

The absolute MAXIMUM you should have done would be telling your mother, and even then that would be a last resort. Those disciplinary actions are most likely going to annihilate any chance he had of being a doctor, and you will have wasted years of his life, and left him with thousands of dollars in debt (hundreds of thousands if in the USA). If you see your brother struggling so much in school that he has to cheat, HELP him, don\u2019t go killing his career because you feel entitled everyone do as you do. Guess what : most people have had to resort to cheating at some time in their academic life. And by the way, all of the tests that actually determine your future as a doctor are impossible to cheat in, so this would not mean a fraudulent doctor would be among the board. He cheated on a \u201cmaintenance\u201d test.\nYTA \nYou possibly ruined your brother\u2019s life\nYou permanently damaged your family", "It may not feel like it but you did the right thing. \n\nBeing a doctor you have people lives in you hands. It may not seem like it if you're not a surgeon,  but every doctor who makes a bad decision does harm. \n\nYour brother isn't doing the studying necessary or maybe this isn't a talent of his. Either way,  when the time comes to do keep up with the latest news,  discoveries, etc he won't. We know he won't because there is no test, so he had to read and study nothing. No test also means he doen't even have to bother trying to cheat.\n\nAs to your parents and anyone else saying you should have handled it within the family tell them YOU DID. You handled it directly with your ADULT brother who refused to stop cheating. \n\nPart of the medical oath is to do no harm.  That also includes being ethical. \n\nYou saw your brother being unethical which will result in him doing harm.  You gave him the opportunity to stop, to stop being unethical, to stop being on the path of doing harm. He chose to keep cheating and lying about what knowledgehe did have. Your brother lacks morals and integrity. \n\nYou DID NOT tear your family apart. Your brother did this all in his own with his actions.\n\nYou DID NOT ruin your brother's future. He did that all in his own. He knew the consequences of cheating. Everyone knows the consequences of cheating in medical school is the potential to be not only being kicked out but banned from the field. They may give him another chance but if he blows it he's out.\n\nYou DID NOT betray the family. Your brother brought dishonor to the family. You brother BETRAYED the medical profession and he his family.\n\nYour brother either thought cheating was easier than studying or he was struggling  massively in medical school. \n\nIf struggling to the extent that he felt compelled to cheat,  that was the time to withdraw and find a career path that comes naturally to him.  Which also mend it'll be easy for him.  Maybe he'd be a great attorney,  financial advisor, web designer, programmer, editor, etc. It may be time to rethink his career path.\n\nI have a friend who has been on a prescription given to her. For years telling her doctor if her side effects,  telling im how she's slowly feeling worse. Every time the doc telling her that is the only medication for her. \n\nThen one day friend talking to the  pharmacist and learned the medication she's on is extremely old. Been used for decades but there's new medication with less side effects and actually works better. \n\nSo she tells her doctor of the 3 alternatives and she'd like to try one of them.  He tells her no,  that this medication he put her on has long history of helping his patients and end of discussion. She trusted her doctor, continued to take the medication,  never changed doctors. She's on dialysis now and the medication... turns out kidney damage is one of the side effects. Her doctor also was regularly testing her blood (for kidney issues) but never noticed her Vitamin D levels were dangerously low. This could be your brother as a doctor in the future. \n\nI thank you for reporting cheaters and keeping us safe. Who knows how many lives you may have saved and their quality of life. \n\nIt took a lot of courage, a strong moral compass, and a strong backbone to report your brother.  If your family can't recognize that,  they don't deserve you. \n\nBest wiishes on your studies and exams.", "That\u2019s not how med school works.
