She is jealous of your choices in life. \n\nYou shouldn't have let her get to you and say that. But I also can understand how you got pushed to that point. The comment about opening her legs and kids with different men was hurtful - you must learn to not let these kinds of people get to you and draw firm boundaries. Next time, simply tell her that your life choices on your own, and that her comments are unwelcome and unnecessary and that you do not wish to engage on them being a topic of discussion any further. \n\nDespite this, NTA. Stay proud of your choices, OP. Just do your best to be cordial and keep developing boundaries and cultivating emotional intelligence. I know it's so delicious to be petty, but in reality we should feel sad for M that she feels the need to tear you down.", "NTA, yeah you could've been the bigger person and not been so harsh, but when people wanna project and make unnecessary comments on people's life style choices, I think it's free game.

Hopefully not the kids.", "Nta the coworker needs to back up and you need to set the line.", "Nta, M is targeting you and harassing and you.

If she keeps after you, say, I\u2019m working and not discussing off work things.  Or tell HER to focus on work.  Leave your personal life out of the office unless that person is a friend outside the office.  (That sometimes develops. My supervisor was my friend outside work, one of a few I socialized with.  Was a tad awkward when she got a promotion, and when she quit to go elsewhere.) you already know she\u2019s annoying, so don\u2019t give her a reason to talk.

There are so many ways, and some pithy,  to get the point across. Half of them are old sayings and true to this day, i.e. To each his own. Everybody's different. Different strokes. You do you.

Try to approach the conversation in a calm and respectful manner, and be open to listening to her perspective.\r  \n\r  \nIn the future, if M's comments become hurtful or unproductive, it might be best to simply disengage and not engage in that kind of conversation.

I wouldn't say she's jealous of you, but she's definitely looking down on you and using her kids as a way to look superior or something? \n\nIt seems like the type of petty where you can just ignore her and she'll stew over it.
