She is jealous of your choices in life. \n\nYou shouldn't have let her get to you and say that. But I also can understand how you got pushed to that point. The comment about opening her legs and kids with different men was hurtful - you must learn to not let these kinds of people get to you and draw firm boundaries. Next time, simply tell her that your life choices on your own, and that her comments are unwelcome and unnecessary and that you do not wish to engage on them being a topic of discussion any further. \n\nDespite this, NTA. Stay proud of your choices, OP. Just do your best to be cordial and keep developing boundaries and cultivating emotional intelligence. I know it's so delicious to be petty, but in reality we should feel sad for M that she feels the need to tear you down.", "NTA, yeah you could've been the bigger person and not been so harsh, but when people wanna project and make unnecessary comments on people's life style choices, I think it's free game. Just be mindful that in the workplace that can backfire real quick on you.", "Sounds like co-worker is a stressed out mom and taking it out on you. Hopefully not the kids.", "Nta the coworker needs to back up and you need to set the line.", "Nta, M is targeting you and harassing and you. You need to stop talking to her and contact her immediately", "NTA", "NTA, entitled mombies are the worst. Life\u2019s purpose isn\u2019t supposed to be a breeding heifer.", "*immature\n\nGeez\n\nBut no, NTA", "NTA for how you handled it.  Y T A for how you wrote this\u2026. Good lord my eyes are bleeding", "NTA! She is.  She needs to MIND HER OWN BUSINESS!", "NTA. Your co-worker is jealous of you. Suggest you ignore her and don\u2019t talk about your plans around her.  If she keeps after you, say, I\u2019m working and not discussing off work things.  Or tell HER to focus on work.  Leave your personal life out of the office unless that person is a friend outside the office.  (That sometimes develops. My supervisor was my friend outside work, one of a few I socialized with.  Was a tad awkward when she got a promotion, and when she quit to go elsewhere.) you already know she\u2019s annoying, so don\u2019t give her a reason to talk. If she says anything, just look at her like she grew 3 heads and ignore.", "Not everyone speaks English.", "Especially since family status is often a protected class, and enforcing gender roles can be ruled as sex discrimination", "Because that\u2019s classic ESH behaviour", "Because it\u2019s misogynistic. If M were a man, she\u2019d certainly wouldn\u2019t be saying the same thing.", "So what if her kids have different fathers? How is your business how many sexual partners she\u2019s had?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "you should still go to HR, have records of everything, if HR doesn't do anything, sue them", "It should have been reported to HR before the OP made a comment herself that likely violates their policy, and to a larger degree \u2026.", "You can call her out without slut shaming.", "How is it her coworker's business how OP lives her life?", "Agreed. There are so many ways, and some pithy,  to get the point across. Half of them are old sayings and true to this day, i.e. To each his own. Everybody's different. Different strokes. You do you. Your wants aren't my needs. Differences of opinion, especially in an office setting don't need to turn into a slanging match.", "This statement has been around for like 4000 years.", "There are ways to call people out without resorting to slut shaming.", "They\u2019re both misogynists. Her coworkers sees her as an incubator who isn\u2019t fulfilling her purpose and OP sees her as lesser for sleeping with multiple people. Neither of those views are okay."]}
