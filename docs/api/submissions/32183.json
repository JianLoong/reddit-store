For birthdays and holidays, they give the kids a check and sometimes a small gift item under $20. I put the checks in an investment account for each kid, and when they are 16, they have enough to buy a car.

I\u2019d buy them a bunch of toys that they never ended up playing with (3 kids = a ton of stuff). Then one year I was over at their place and discovered a closet FULL of unopened toys.  From then on I just bought them clothes.  My brother and his wife appreciated that.  Now that the kids are older and can do their own shopping, I just get them gift cards.\n\nNTA", "OP tell her to cancel the presents & buy ONE item.

I\u2019ve had to stop my husband from giving her gift ideas for our kids because she\u2019ll just go out and buy anything immediately when he sends it to her. Problem is they really can\u2019t afford it and my kids really don\u2019t need $70 wallets at their age.Your idea of an experience gift is so much nicer and will be treasured for much longer than anything physical ever will be.", "INFO\n\nWhat does your SO think?", "NTA - and Hubs needs to step up here.  So much the better if your SIL will join forces.  The message ought to be:\n\n\"MIL, we love you and appreciate what you are doing, but buying so much is inconsistent with the values we want to teach our children.  We agreed to do an event so that the kids would have an experience they could remember with Grandma and Grandpa, and you agreed with that as their Christmas present.\n\nYou did not follow that rule, though, and now have put the rest of us in an awkward position.  You therefore need to cancel your order, and you may get each grandchild ONE thing to open at Christmas, and it cannot cost more than $Y.  \n\nYou can also get them (collectively or individually) a book or something to describe the adventure we are going to have (maybe a packet with brochures, and a calendar for each so they can mark off the days until the event), and then WHEN WE GO ON THE ADVENTURE you can get them ONE other thing that must fit in their suitcase and may not cost more than $Y.\n\nAnything else will be either returned to Amazon or donated to charity.\"\n\nOh, and if Grandma is hung up on the $$ amount, she can buy $X worth of a gift and then either open a bank account for college or get a savings bond with the rest of the money.  $450 a year into a 529 account can be pretty significant by the time a kid graduates.\n\nYes, this will cause some hurt feelings the first year and MIL will push back hard.  That's why (a) hubs has to take the lead - it's his mom and while she might be angry, she is unlikely to stay mad at him as long as she might at you; and (b) If all the grandchildren are being treated the same, it's easier for her to swallow.  That's why you need SIL on board with the plan.\n\nOne final thing - Your MIL is likely not accomplishing her goal by purchasing so much for the kids.  If there is so much \"stuff\" that it has no meaning, it's not likely to be remembered as it gets lost in the noise of everything.\n\nTo give you an example, one grandfather to our kids, from the time they were born until he passed, got them each a silver dollar on their birthday and Christmas (not really a dollar, those commemorative minted things that you can't spend).  They knew it was \"money\" but couldn't be spent, and we gave them to them when they were grown.  One cashed theirs in for college money; another made Xmas tree ornaments out of theirs, and the third just has them in a box waiting for their own kids to grow up.  Grandpa's gone now, but those coins made far more of an impression than any of the other stuff they got as presents because they are unique and identifiable.\n\nGrandma needs to tone it down quite a bit.  If you don't get a handle on this now, she's going to be gifting cars when kids turn driving age, whether you like it or not!", "MIL put the burden on herself by agreeing to smaller amounts of gifts then bought the whole list breaking the agreement.  It is too bad she now has to go to all that trouble but it is her own fault.  Don\u2019t feel guilty and don\u2019t apologize because you did nothing wrong.", "YTA. Just let her buy the gifts she wants! Dont feel inferior just because the gifts your kids want don't come from you. Just put the money you would have used for gifts into their college funds.", "She shouldn\u2019t do anything for the kids at all because you are extra", "YTA. That\u2019s her love language. You\u2019ve told her once, told her twice. Just let her be. Next time give her a different list. Honestly, I have people in my family that would buy everything on a list, that\u2019s just how they are, they love buying, spoiling, gifting. It\u2019s their thing. No one is going to change them. Seriously, what harm is she doing? This is not a hill you should die on.", "NTA $500 or $300 per human is to much to spend on people. She went back on the agreement this is her problem. Other grandmother's just bake cookies or do the dinner. It's not some kind of gift competition.", "YTA", "NTA:  Your the mother, right?  Well...part of that role is setting boundaries not only for your kids but also for well-meaning relatives.  It's time MIL was told, not asked, but TOLD what she was allowed to give.  $500 in presents for a child at Christmas is ridiculous.", "NTA but some people are excessive gift givers and some insist fairness is by cost. Your MIL is both and I doubt you can change that.\n\nMy friend's mom is an excessive gift giver by quantity and despite having a close relationship with her mom she had a lot of difficulty talking her mom into not buying lots of cheap toys that broke easily as opposed to one or two better made toys for the same cost. Young kids don't know the cost of things but they know what they like to play with and if they have lots of toys the ones they don't prefer get forgotten. I'm on your side but it's not an easy fight to win. You might be better off picking a few expensive things and only presenting them as an option for the $500 budget. There's some excellent STEM toys like the Ravensberger Gravitrax xxl starter set for about $100 that would use up her gift buying budget nicely, if you find a few things like that your kids get quality toys without you being overwhelmed with stuff.", "How does Christmas and gift giving end up so ugly in some families?\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts where gift giving ends up causing friction. It's so sad.", "Nta but many would kill to have a generous mil", "May I suggest \"Want, Need, Wear, Read\". She may only give four gifts to each child: something they want, something they need, something to wear, and something to read.", "NTA. My mom acted like this, and they're not financially stable, so it was frustrating on multiple levels. What ended up being the most helpful was getting the kids to make separate lists for her. She still buys them stuff they don't want, like or need, but it's less annoying when I'm not in charge of list making. I buy experiences for my kids as gifts, so that helps.\nUltimately, I'm a bit of an AH and so are my parents. How are my kids supposed to feel genuine gratitude when they receive so much at every turn? \nAnd to be fair, my kids are great", "NTA really but who cares if she wants to buy your kids Christmas gifts and enjoys doing so? Get over it", "NTA. My MIL is similar. We don't have kids, but the neices and nephews get mountains of stuff that ends up in the trash. One year she literally dropped $300 a piece at the dollar store per kid. \n\nMy BIL just asked for her to buy them ski passes to the nearest ski run. Spends her budget and the kids have something to do. Plus then other family members can help with the gear", "I agree that\u2019s a great idea. She won\u2019t do it. She insists on gifts. I have sold stuff that they don\u2019t want in the past and saved the money for them but that\u2019s a ton of work I don\u2019t have time for", "A check. A gift. A book. Plenty!", "Thanks. We\u2019ve asked for contributions to their savings but she won\u2019t do that. She insists of gifts. We thought a trip would be a good solution but now I\u2019m out of ideas", "Right?!?! She gets a paper list from here on out.", "You can make lists private and I\u2019ve done that in the past, have a private list for us and public for grandparents but it always makes way more work for me moving stuff from list to list and in past years she hasn\u2019t even bought off the lists", "That's how I did it as well.  My mother would see a list and buy everything. Now that my kids are teens, she sends them money.  I imagine for my young nieces and nephews, she's still clearing out whatever list is given to her. But dealing with that is my sisters' problem.\n\nI also have a BIL who CANNOT accept \"please no gifts.\"", "Since MIL\u2019s love language is gifts she can create her own list. Part of gifting (when it\u2019s your love language) is putting thought into meaningful gifts. To dismiss and outright claim the mental load of another person just to slap your name on the \u201cfrom\u201d tag is selfish, not an expression of love language.", "Then You need to make your husband in charge of your gift list for the MIL. You will only give him sizes of the kids clothes/shoes. If he wants to save his mommy\u2019s feelings he can do the labor.", "The other thing you can do for the future is ONLY give her gifts  you want her to buy on a list specifically for her. One gift for each kid? Do just that. Three? Give a list with only those items.", "Create a gift list that only has items she can buy. You can make a 'secret' list for your use.  Not perfect but something.", "Find expensive, extravagant items (one per child) within her budget and give her a list of them - I mean - one expensive present per child.

I would always work to create a list and would give her all 'the good stuff' to make it easier.  Looking back I wish I would not have done that.\n\nA suggestion, moving forward, provide a list, include experiences on the list?  Tickets to sports venues, maybe local waterparks or gift cards to fun places.  Your in laws could choose to participate in those events. I guess what I am saying is don't provide a list of items to purchase for her at all. \n\nWith my MIL is was always about the excess under the tree. I understand your frustration.  We did get to the point where we simply took items back, feelings be dammed.  There is only so much room and people only need so many things.

That\u2019s selfish. If they want to buy gifts that the parents will just give away, no one is stopping them. However, to take a list that has been curated with thought and care by the parents and buy everything on the list, leaving nothing for others is very very thoughtless,", "To be fair my husband remembers what size my son is in a lot of stuff better than I do.

She gets her own, separate list with 1-2 extravagant items per kid. Hell, they are getting to the age where gaming might become one of their main hobbies, toss up a ps5, Xbox series x, a new tv, a nice computer monitor, Nintendo switch, etc. If she\u2019s gonna insist on spending that much with no room for discussion, might as well take advantage and get some nice big ticket items out of it.", "As your kids get older they might want expensive stuff.  PCs, phones, laptops, tablets, wireless headphones, makeup, clothes, video game consoles, brand name sneakers, etc.  $500 is *nothing*.  You can spend it in a blink on a tween or teen.\n\nI would caution you to think deeply before burning this bridge and putting MIL off.  You might regret it down the line if she decides it's not appreciated and stops.  You might be robbing your kids of years of wish lists fulfilled.\n\nIn comparison making a unique wish list isn't that hard.  This is a problem lots of less well off parents would love to have.

As in, don't give her any lists or put any emotional or physical energy into this battle prior to the holidays. Then, when she gives the kids boat loads of expensive and useless items, let the kids pick out maybe 3-4 items they want to keep and donate the rest to a family homeless shelter, school, or children's hospital. My local children's hospital is always short on toys. There are many donation options that can make way more of an impact than just dumping them at Goodwill. Plus, it could be a really fun activity to do with your kids. Kids receive lots of gifts but rarely get to experience giving gifts in this way. It would be an excellent teaching moment and could be super fun.", "I really appreciate that you want them to have experiences.

That\u2019s on me. So I alter the list or give them more general ideas.
