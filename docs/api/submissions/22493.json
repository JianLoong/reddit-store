Single. Damn. Time. It. Happens.\n\nNow, I understand that she needs to vent and I'm supporting of her doing so, but its gotten too much and I'm really struggling to help her, or do anything but sit there and take it.\n\nI offer suggestions and alternatives but she shoots them down all the time. Change jobs? She cant, she's not got the money to be able to quit or any job prospects lined up. Make a complaint? That'll change nothing, sure they'll apologise and say they'll make the neccesary changes, but they won't.  Not really. File a legal claim? She'd have to go on long-term sick leave (yo show what an effect its having on her health) and she can't afford that while she waits potentially years for a lawsuit to get settled.\n\nWhat can I do? I've tried, I really have, but in the end I kinda said \"well, if you're not gonna do any of that, then all you can do is sit down, shut up and take it, because complaining about it to me isn't going to change anything and you're just working yourself up about it\" (she has anxiety issues so getting stressed makes this MUCH worse)\n\nNow, I fully admit, I probably said that a bit harshly, but what else can I do? I just dont even know anymore, so, AITA?", "created_utc": 1689601235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1522apv/aita_for_being_fed_up_of_my_wifes_constant/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep up with her on it.\n\nAlso lastly let her know that her mood around her work is affecting your relationship and marriage..m that this can't keep going on.", "NTA.  I personally take the belief that the occasional vent over a frustrating situation is fine, but when the complaining is habitual and you aren\u2019t willing to do anything to better the situation you need to shut up.\nTell her that her work, and the constant complaints, are impacting your relationship negatively.  That her mental well-being is important and if she\u2019s unable to leave work at work, she needs to find something else or someone else to complain to.  You can support her, as a spouse should do, but you don\u2019t have to be her therapist too\u2026", "NTA, but \u2026\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want solutions (as you have figured out). She wants to vent. There is nothing you can do.", "NTA. Maybe she should go to counseling- sounds like she could benefit from it. Or maybe even go to couple\u2019s counseling as well so she doesn\u2019t feel alone\u2026 everyone can benefit from counseling.", "Ask her what she wants. Do you want my help or do you just want to vent? Then tell her she has 5 minutes of your undivided attention & then you\u2019re going to change the subject or walk away. Then do that.\n\nAlso, it very fair to ask your partner to not talk about a particular subject.

NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's important to understand that sometimes people want to vent rather than find a solution, but that's not workable long-term for a consistent complaint. I think people underestimate how draining it is to hear someone complain about the same thing day in and day out, it's a miserable experience. \n\nShe's 31, she has the vast majority of her working life ahead of her and not behind her, how long does she plan on spinning her wheels at this job? And obviously she doesn't have job prospects lined up, you need to job hunt for those to exist.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs to figure something else out. Venting at you until it's affecting your mental health is not okay. She won't accept solutions or come up with a plan to fix things. She just wants to complain, and expects you to take the mental load of listening to her do it all the time. She's being selfish.", "NTA - life is too short to be in a job you hate and no job is truly unquittable, she\u2019s putting up artificial barriers.", "NTA, you've offered reasonable solutions. It does sound like she wants to vent. I had a job with similar circumstances, and I eventually quit when it got too bad. I borrowed money and moved. I was afraid if I continued, something bad might happen, and I'd lose my license. I talked to the risk management people about concerns, nothing happened with those. So her concerns are valid. But for me, it got too the point whee every day was the worst day of my life, and I couldn't continue living like that, so I quit and found a much better job.", "NTA\n\nComplaining is normal. But she should not be doing this constantly to you.\n\nYou already told her you don't want to hear this all the time. She should respect that and find another solution", "You need to begin each conversation with, are you venting or asking for advice. That allows you to know what is expected of you and reminds her that you are offering to be what she needs.", "idk if ytah yet. i see alot of SHE can't, SHE doesn't have the money etc. i don't see any of what you can contribute to help her improve her situation. Aren't y'all a team?", "ESH\n\nYou both need better communication skills. Sounds like she wants to talk and have you LISTEN. NOT tell her what to do or how to fix it. Many men feel helpless or frustrated if they can\u2019t fix a problem so they fall into the \u2018I can\u2019t fix it. I\u2019m tired of even hearing about it\u2019 trope. You have conflicting needs from a conversation. Work it out. Counseling can help. \n\nShe needs to find a therapist so you are not the only one she\u2019s venting to. \n\nBut she should be able to talk to her partner about her frustrations and worries and have a safe space with emotional support. \n\nI get that it\u2019s frustrating when someone complains about the same thing without fixing it or changing anything. But you are both approaching conversations with different goals and expectations. \n\nCommunicate with each other.", "NAH the thing you don\u2019t understand is, she probably just needs you to \u201csit there and take it\u201d. She needs to vent, she needs to be heard and she needs someone on her side. You don\u2019t have to fix it, I promise, you couldn\u2019t anyway! You can do everything she needs without fixing anything, just by being there and being on her side. You sound like a good husband op. It\u2019s hard work, and you\u2019re killing it.", "NTA.\nBeing a supportive spouse is one thing, but becoming an emotional punching bag it's not ok.\nYou have offered suggestions and alternatives, but she's taking none of it.\nI can sympathize with her, but not excuse her behavior.\nI work in healthcare, and the last 3 years have been hell with the pandemic. I was about to go on bournout at some point, but I never treated my family like this. I would have said: 'I'm tired' or 'how long this will go on', but from time to time. I knew that I had the choice to resign or hold on, and I decided to suck it up and keep doing my job. \nAt some point I thought of going to see a therapist to help me, because it was my problem to deal with. Luckly thing got better, so I didnt have to go seeing one. \n\nSo, If your wife doesnt want to try to make things change at her work, it's not your fault. Complain while doing nothing to change the situation, hardly help.\nMaybe a therapist can help her, because you can't be dragged down in this spiral of anger and negativity.\nSay to her that you love her, but things need to change or it will also affect your mental health.\n\nGood luck!", "ESH. She needs to moderate and actively look for something else on the side. You aren't there only to dump on. But otoh you signed up to listen. It might help to ask, do you want solutions or sympathy. And maybe gently suggest she also find another person to sometimes share with. You're her partner not her therapist.

Are we really living in the year 2023 with someone who doesn't know you don't solve problems you empathise with the person complaining.\n\nHave you tried just sitting there listening and then saying in a pause \"that's terrible that must have upset you so much.\"\n\nAnd before anyone says yes that is emotionally taxing to do every day. You can set boundaries or break up. But if you're in just listen ya dingus.", "YTA. It is really exhausting when someone is constantly complaining about something, I totally get it, but you haven't handled it very well either. She isn't complaining because she wants feedback or ideas or solutions from you. Like you said, she is venting. If you would like her to stop the constant negativity, you have to approach that conversation differently. Like, just be very calm and nice about it, but tell her how this constant negativity is making you feel. Do not tell her what she should do or how it probably makes her life shittier too (although that is most likely true), because that will just feel to her like you are not on her side. That's something that she needs to figure out herself. Maybe take her out to relax and get her mind off work. Go to a spa together or something lol", "It really helped me to read Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.  Some people want to hear suggestions to a problem.

Although my coworkers can make it miserable. I complain to my fianc\u00e9 often, and he always wants to offer solutions. It\u2019s honestly not uncommon for our partners to want to offer guidance, but sometimes we seek out our partners just to vent our frustrations and get it off our chest because we don\u2019t have anyone else to go to.\n\nI think she\u2019s just coming to you for validation, without needing a solution presented because she obviously knows that a new job would be her best bet. Although, I also understand that listening to the same complaint over and over again can be tiresome. My fianc\u00e9 and I have dedicated the first hour after we get off work every day to decompressing for a while (in whatever personal way that may be such as reading or playing a video game) and then coming together for a bit and getting everything from the work day off our chests and then we move on from it.

She can start looking, but that's incredibly stressful and you're coming across like she doesn't get to talk to you about it and you're not sympathetic. Ask what you can do to support her job search or decompression out of work. If she's ill/disabled and you just say \"oh well! I told you to get a new job or sue\" that's not actually supportive.", "i get that and idk what you do for a living or if you have your own medical conditions to deal with but many people take second and third jobs to get through tough times. the real questions here are \n\nare her medical conditions legit?\n\ndoes her current employment exacerbate her issues?\n\ndo you love her?\n\nis her default setting misery regardless if she is healthy?\n\nif the first 3 answers are yes and the 4th is no then yta if you don't suck it up and step up and get her out of there immediately. sacrifice is an important part of love and marriage. are you really willing to have her stay there because you don't want to work harder even just for a little while?"]}
