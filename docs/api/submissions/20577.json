My [32f] best friend [32f] of ten years missed my Mom\u2019s funeral. \n\nAfter a horrible illness, my Mom passed away four years ago. It was a really difficult time, she died before reaching her pension age with lots of life left to live. My Mom always welcomed all my friends into her home and put on great gatherings and parties, so lots of my friends attended the funeral. My best friend messaged me to tell me she had the day booked off work and asked if I\u2019d like her to be there to support me. I of course said yes. On the day of the funeral we arrived with the hearse, and looking around, I couldn\u2019t see my best friend. She didn\u2019t appear at the wake either. That night I saw on Instagram she\u2019d posted photos of being on a date with her new boyfriend, hiking. \n\nFor four years I never bought this up and continued the friendship normally, despite being hurt. I suppose I buried it down. Recently my friend has been struggling with her mental health, to the point where I\u2019ve had to drop everything last minute and often very late at night, to have her over to support her. This weekend we had a disagreement about me not being invited to something, to which she was quite sharp with me. I ended up telling her I wasn\u2019t just there for when she needed support and that we were meant to be friends during other times too. I ended up exploding and confronting her about not even being there for me at my own mother\u2019s funeral, to which she completely denied ever being invited, saying she wanted to keep a respectful distance, even going as far as saying I was lying as she wasn\u2019t even with her boyfriend during the time my mom passed away. I provided her screenshots from 4 years ago of not only the conversation we had about her asking if she needed my support on the day, but also pictures of her boyfriend on her Instagram hiking on the day of the funeral.\n\nAITA for bringing it up after this many years, and during a time where her mental health is bad?", "created_utc": 1687705428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ioh92/aita_for_confronting_my_best_friend_for_skipping/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was awful for not showing up for your mother\u2019s funeral.  But waiting four years to raise it, and only as ammunition to defend yourself against her own upset toward you, at a time when you admit she\u2019s going through a mental health crisis and therefore is more emotionally vulnerable, was a dick move.  If you are upset with someone, address it in a straightforward manner on its own merits.  Collecting grievances to weaponize later does nothing productive.", "NTA. Your friendship sounds very one-sided and she sounds very manipulative. Best friends should also never leave each other out, she doesn't seem like a great friend", "ESH. Her for missing the funeral. And you, for holding onto this grudge for 4 years.", "I am probably going to take some heat on this one but I am going with YTA.  \n\nYou had 4 years to talk to her about this. But instead you collected receipts and waited for her to be in a poor mental state and then you tell her how she let you down.  Sure, she was an AH and not a good friend. But you chose to let it go for 4 years and then bombard her with it when she is at her lowest, and that makes you a bigger AH.", "ESH. You have screenshots of a text convo from 4 years ago that you\u2019ve been harboring resentment over for 4 years while pretending like nothing is wrong? That\u2019s not ok. You should have called her out then. Now you used her missing the funeral to hurt her now because you weren\u2019t invited to something? That\u2019s really unfair. It absolutely sucks that she didn\u2019t show at the funeral. No doubt.", "NTA, though you could have handled it better. But not handling something the best doesn't always rise to the level of asshole and I think that's where this lands. \n\nYou've realized that your friendship is one-sided, you let it fester FAR too long, but a recent example was the last straw and you confronted her with previous examples. I don't think any of that makes you an asshole. Your \"all take, no give\" friend however, is.", "So for four years you didn\u2019t communicate your feelings, continued to be her best friend, and then decided when she\u2019s struggling with something to bring it up\u2026? \n\nESH. \n\nIt sucks she missed your moms funeral to hangout with her partner. That\u2019s objectively a shitty thing for her to do. But the way you went about your feelings is so immature and childish, I struggle to believe you\u2019re both in your thirties. You chose to let it slide, you chose to bury it. You don\u2019t get to bring it up four years later as some kind of \u201cgotcha.\u201d \n\nIf you don\u2019t communicate your feelings and angers in a friendship, that\u2019s on you. Perhaps if you had brought up your feelings years ago, it could have been resolved. Instead you waited four years after the fact, while she\u2019s dealing with something, and you expect her to have a rational mature response\u2026? She has to try to remember what happened four years ago..? Maybe this was a complete misunderstanding. Maybe there\u2019s a good reason she didn\u2019t go. You wouldn\u2019t know that, because you waited years to bring it up. \n\nYou don\u2019t get a medal for swallowing your feelings, and you don\u2019t get to act like a victim when you finally bring it up years later when the other person is struggling.

Your friend asked if they could go to the funeral, and they still didn't even show up, and instead going on a hike with her boyfriend was kind of a dick move on her part. on your part, you probably shouldn't have kept it unmentioned for so long and bring it up earlier, or not bring it up when her mental health isn't getting any better.", "I think this \u201cfriendship\u201d is toxic for both of you & should probably be done with if you\u2019re both keeping score of \u201cwho was \u2018there for each other\u2019 when.\u201d Friendship isn\u2019t about keeping score.", "Well done.

Of course, mainly for the fact that hanging on to this so long is not good for your mental health (as you can probably see), but you mom just did so I'm going to give you some grace in that.

You are right, I shouldn\u2019t have left it this long. I just tried to get back to normal and not be so sensitive at the time. I think I need to understand sometimes you have to talk about certain things as they happen, even if it\u2019s awkward or scary. I think at the time I decided to just push it way down in order to prioritize healing from the loss of my mom. Probably not the right thing to do.", "I understand. I\u2019m not proud of bringing it up after all these years and genuinely wanted to just let go of it, but obviously it was something that just came out due to feeling frustrated. I suppose I always feel like I\u2019m there for her whenever she needs me and don\u2019t get the same support in return. It was the biggest example I could use, but not at the right time. Wasn\u2019t my intention to weaponize the situation but I suppose the hurt came tumbling out.", "I mean, some may call it collecting receipts but honestly I never intended to bring it up. It spilled out in a frustrated moment when I felt like I was doing so much to emotionally support her and was getting nothing back. Not great on my behalf, but certainly I\u2019m not the type to collect receipts to use against people on a rainy day. It was the biggest example of when I felt let down by her and yeah I might be the AH for bringing it up after all this time. But during the healing process of losing Mom, I wasn\u2019t strong enough to confront this. Even after 2, 3 years, I was still healing. Not even fully there yet. Maybe I have a complex of losing more people and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t confront it head on. Who knows. But I certainly didn\u2019t hold on to it to point-score, it that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. Frustration and sadness got the better of me that day.", "Like I said to another commenter, the screenshots aren\u2019t 4 years old. The conversation is, and I searched the word \u201cfuneral\u201d to go back to it. It\u2019s not just the one occasion I\u2019ve not been invited to something. In fact, there have been multiple times she has arranged things with other mutual friends and I find out after the fact, yet I seem to be the person she calls in the middle of the night for support. I pointed out I\u2019d like to be invited to things that don\u2019t just involve providing support for a crisis.", "Yeah I get this. At the time I thought I was doing the right thing by just letting it go, figuring life was too short and that at least some of my other friends attended. Totally the wrong thing and I should have just asked her a week later why she chose to go hiking instead of turning up to the funeral. I really struggled with the loss of my mom and didn\u2019t want to risk losing a friend I love by bringing it up. I tried to be happy that she had a great time and had found a boyfriend she was enjoying time with. I honestly haven\u2019t held on to it to use at an appropriate time, in reality I never thought we\u2019d even have this conversation. But I guess after feeling like I\u2019d been used once again as some support crutch (particularly when things go wrong with said-boyfriend), I just lost my temper and pointed out that she isn\u2019t really there for me that much. I shouldn\u2019t have used the funeral as an example.", "I understand this. Neither of us have children or spouses. And she did message me two weeks in advance to ask if I\u2019d like her to attend. Seeing her go on a date instead was hurtful.", "She didn\u2019t go because she went on a hike.", "I can understand that. It can be really hard to raise it with someone we care about when they hurt us, because the prospect that they may not accept it or acknowledge how they hurt us is really anxiety provoking.  Unfortunately when we bring it up only in response to them raising their own hurt, it tends to undermine our own experiences because it looks like something trumped up to avoid responsibility for our own actions, so it\u2019s worth pushing through our own anxiety with people we care about to be upfront about our feelings.", "No, eff that. Bring it up! Never bury your own feelings! Don't apologize OP! Your friend isn't a friend. She chose a literal random stranger over someone she knew for 10 years? He wasn't a long time boyfriend at the time, he was new but more importantly, even if he was a long time boyfriend, you don't agree to support a friend at their parent's funeral and then skip.\n\nLosing a parent is so hard. People sometimes become serial killers due to the traumatic effect of losing a parent. It's literally one of the stressful things in people's life journey. \n\nDon't apologize!", "You took screen shots and saved them for 4 years and showed them to her to prove that you were right.", "We live and we learn. It\u2019s almost always better to communicate feelings at the time the feelings are happening. You feel like a crutch likely because you feel like it\u2019s unfair that you are there for her and she wasn\u2019t for you, but in her mind that was resolved years ago. In her mind she\u2019s doing a normal thing, leaning on her friend for support. But you allowed resentment to build up so it doesn\u2019t seem fair to you. \n\nHave a mature and honest conversation with your friend. This is a decade long friendship, I think you owe it to yourself to have a mature conversation and try to resolve this. If it doesn\u2019t get resolved, then that\u2019s a friendship gone. But this isn\u2019t all on her.", "What was your response to her question as to whether you'd like her to attend your mother's funeral?", "She was on a hike when the funeral happened.  That might not be why she didn't go.  \n\nPeople skip funerals all the time for personal reasons.", "This is really useful advice and insight, and I\u2019ll try and carry it forward. Thank you.", "Actually no, I searched the word \u201cfuneral\u201d in our facebook messages and it took me to the point in the conversation where she promised to be there for my mom\u2019s funeral.", "Thank you, I appreciate your advice. Maybe in a few days I\u2019ll ask if she wants to talk about it. I do love her and I think that\u2019s why I tried to let it go 4 years ago. I know she didn\u2019t miss it to intentionally hurt me, but I think sometimes she gets swept up in things (she\u2019s fairly impulsive), and didn\u2019t make the nicest choice on that occasion. I hope we can talk like adults (and friends) and work it out. Thanks again.", "\u201cYes please, do come on [date of funeral] [heart emoji]\u201d", "That\u2019s absolutely fine but I would have preferred her not offering to be there in the first place, and then not even acknowledging the funeral even happened. If she had messaged me to tell me she actually wouldn\u2019t be attending, I would have been ok with that. But to just not turn up, that\u2019s what I found hurtful.", "|I provided her screenshots from 4 years ago of not only the conversation we had about her asking if she needed my support on the day, but also pictures of her boyfriend on her Instagram hiking on the day of the funeral.\n\nJust going off your words in your post.", "Hope it works out!", "No wonder you were so hurt when she was not only a no-show but was posting pictures showing her happy day hiking with her new boyfriend.", "Sure, its fine to be hurt.  But it's too late.  Let the issue go or let the friendship go.", "Lol. When people change their story not to look bad.", "Absolutely, but you\u2019re sort of making it sound like I\u2019d saved them 4 years ago and was keeping them for a point-scoring exercise. Not the case. The conversation is 4 years old, not the screenshots. And I think when someone close promises to be there for a massive event (like the funeral of a parent) then denies ever committing to attend and accuses you of lying, - you surely should be able to show them what they actually said? Maybe it was a little late down the line, but I didn\u2019t keep them in a special ammunition folder like you\u2019re sort of implying.", "Absolutely not changing my story, I haven\u2019t been sat for 4 years staring at screenshots but when she denied ever saying she\u2019d be there to support me I searched our messenger chat with the word \u201cfuneral\u201d because I knew she had promised about two weeks prior. And alas, there is was, so I screenshotted and reminded her of the promise."]}
