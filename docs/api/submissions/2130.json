Now I may not have a paycheck coming in, but me taking care of the house reduces the stress surrounding it and helps him focus on other things.\n\nIf she's not working outside the home, she needs to be working inside the home.

I think you guys just need more discussion, but its absolutely fine for you to have weekends that you just want to stay home.", "NTA but it sounds like you both need to communicate expectations for your roles better. She wants a partner who\u2019s involved in the house upkeep - fine. But that means that her role will have to adjust as well as it\u2019s unfair to ask you to do 75% of the work in your relationship (50% being the sole provider + half of the housework)\n\nI\u2019d have a conversation with her.", "NTA I'm in a similar setup but reverse genders.

I work about 24-30 hours a week and my bf works 40 hours a week. We have no children. I generally do all the chores: laundry, vacuum, cleaning, and some cooking (he likes to cook and I hate it so he usually does it)\n\n\nOn the weekends we very rarely go shopping or things like that. We might go out for a few drinks but any errands that need done, I do during the week so we can have the weekend to spend together, at home.

I'm so sick of doing everything outside the house alone, it only makes me feel lonelier.", "If she is a sahw, her job is the house chores and shopping. Your job is to fund it and make she has equal access to $.", "NTA - it's a common issue that just needs to be honestly discussed. Having such different roles leads to different wants and needs in various situations. If you've had a rough week but she needs to get out then you should watch the kids while she does something with friends or something. If everyone is just honest about what they want and everyone faces reality you'll find solutions", "NAH. Quality time is important for the health of your relationship. Right now you both have needs and expectations that are not being met. She needs to feel that you're invested in spending time with her, and you need her to respect that you're rightfully tired after a long week of work outside the home. She expects her need to be met a certain way, and you expect your need to be met a certain way. Instead of her ambushing you with a list of to-do's and go-to's, and you shutting her down completely, sit down and figure out *together* a compromise that makes you *both* feel heard and respected.", "ESH. So what does she do all week if not chores? Since you're supporting her and you don't have children, all chroes and housework should be done when you get home (obviously not things that she physically can't do). \n\nAnd you are TA because she clearly wants to go and do stuff with you and you just sound like you don't care.", "NAH. \nMissing context. \nSounds like she doesn't want you to just run errands she wants quality time with her husband. \nLiving together =/= spending time together. \nThis might be a communication issue too.", "NAH. It\u2019s understandable that you want to rest and she wants to get out. She should probably focus on some hobbies to keep her active and busy during the week so weekends don\u2019t feel like the only time she gets to be out and socialize. I\u2019d also say, you have to make a bit of time some weekend to do things with her and around the house. Compromise here is key. Also her finding a purpose for herself outside of stay at home wife might give her more satisfaction, like she\u2019s not spending life waiting on you but rather sharing it with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I always make sure that I do all the chores except yard work. It doesn't even take half the day to do them. Even now that we have a son I still have lots of time left to twiddle my thumb after doing chores while my husband is at work\n It doesn't sound fair to me that you still have to do a lot of chores when she has all day to do them why is she even a stay at home wife if she doesn't do them", "Unless you are leaving out something significant (eg caring responsibilities for a relative, her own illness/disability) things are already incredibly easy for her.

So what does she do all week?", "Sorry but if that's her routine and then you also said that most chores like laundry and vacuuming are saved for the weekend so you do them as well....how is she a stay at home wife?

So young with nothing going on on her own? How'd she become a sahw? What was her ambitions in life before you?", "At least the sex is good?

I work a full time job and do most of our household chores. Your wife is lazy and you are being taken advantage of.

Like she's not a stay-at-home, she's not doing any work, she's just chilling", "My guy. This is not ok. It sounds like you not only provide for her financially, but still do a huge amount of chores AND then you have to entertain her over the weekend instead of being able to rest? I would ask yourself what she brings to this relationship, honestly.", "oh, ok, she needs a therapist.

Because honestly it does just sound like an excuse so that she can not hold up her end as a partner right now. Being mentally ill does not excuse her taking advantage of you", "This sounds like codependency or extreme social anxiety. You did mention her mental health as a reason she doesn't want to work. Can you elaborate on this? It really sounds like she's just lazy, but if it's not that then she really does need therapy.", "Then I\u2019ll say NTA with the caveat that you need to compromise a bit since this is a mental health condition situation. If she\u2019s not already, therapy and medication work wonders! I know a lot of people have prejudices and stigma but truly think if any physical condition and what you would want your spouse to do. If she had cancer, you\u2019d be encouraging and supporting her to get chemo (or whatever treatment). Please do the same here if you haven\u2019t yet. \n\nI also think it\u2019s important to talk to her about your feelings of exhaustion and needing to relax. There has to be a middle ground if doing a few things but not all the things.", "I also have m natal health but been working since forever.  You got suckered bro", ">She has a car and could go places\n\nThere we go... NTA.  Very much so.  I was going to ask if you had public transit so she can go out and explore but... she has a car?  Wow.  No.  Her waiting for you to have time off to go out and do things is ridiculous when you work full time.  Maybe a 2-3 hour trip to a mall or something, or go out to dinner... but you need your rest time.\n\nDoes she have any friends our any other person to spend time with?", "Meh ESH. While it\u2019s understandable that you think she should take the bulk of the chores as she is a stay at home wife, it sounds like she just wants to spend some time with you and thinks this is the way to go about it.

This woman seems to do nothing!!", "I'm aware, but that was my situation and the reason my husband and I stayed home. It still applies.

Even if I\u2019m on 7/12s while my husbands on regular 5/8s I\u2019ll pick up the slack if he\u2019s been having a rough time, it\u2019s a partnership.", "You are her only adult conversation and interaction and you want her to\u2026.. not go anywhere?

Always give the benefit of the doubt.", "It\u2019s called a homemaker. You don\u2019t need to have kids to be a SAHW; society has just deemed it only acceptable if you have kids. There\u2019s many childfree couples that are happy with one s/o staying home to take care of things, including the pets if they have some. \n\nOP could possibly enjoy providing for his wife, and may not want to make her work, as some people are like that.", "Seriously!! It IS being unemployed!

He also falls down and forgets where he is which hust adds to his inability to be alone.]\n\nThe process of getting him assessed and approved for  care hours has taken over a year so for that entire time I was \"unemployed\" to a lot of people, as i wasn't bringing in an income. My spouse included. \n\nWhich was why on top of that I was also responsible for taking care of ALL of our household chores/cooking as well, I was also responsible for taking care of all four of our animals by myself. \n\nI was honestly exhausted all the time. \n\nAnd while I don't think this is a case like mine, it's always a possibility.", "It's called lazy bones.

Thank you for being an awesome person!", "At first I assumed they had kids but he clearly says they don\u2019t. OP is NTA because what the heck is she doing all day?! I assume the point of being a \u201cstay at home wife\u201d is to alleviate day-to-day stresses like shopping and chores lol", "I'm guessing she may have high anxiety, agoraphobia, or some other mental health issue that causes her to feel stuck without her crutch, which would be the husband. People do cope this way, but it's the very definition of codependency.", "As a SAH wife, my chores list is a few hours a day, max. We have no kids - there\u2019s just literally not enough to do that would take me more than that. My husband 100% works more hours than I do. Which is why anything I can do, is done before he gets home (by that I mean repairs that he is just more mechanically inclined to fix, and that I would probably make worse if I tried. But I\u2019ll YouTube how to do something I\u2019m not sure of before just deciding it\u2019s his). This dude is totally being taken advantage of.", "Based on his post history, I would guess yes.

Might want to check which thread you're on.", "??? Why is op her only adult interaction and conversation? And he never said he doesn\u2018t want her to go anywhere, he just doesn\u2018t want to go this weekend. She has a car and is free to meet people whenever she wants even on weekdays.

What on earth is she doing expecting him to do chores on his weekend when he is working 48-hour work weeks?", "Yeah I've been the stay at home parent and the working in that case expected household help from my partner/expected to help out, cause kids make cleaning difficult. \n\nBut if I worked all week to support a spouse while they stayed home with no kids, and then they had the audacity to ask me to do chores over the weekend I'd lose my shit. I mean, big projects or organizing together occasionally is fine, but not basic day to day stuff.", "True. But she doesn\u2019t have the pressure of having to meet the expectations of others, as one who works outside the home does. Trying to please your bosses, co-workers, support team: it\u2019s exhausting and draining. She needs to find some empathy.", "Taking care of the house with no kids is maybe a couple hours of work a day.", "There shouldn't be any chores but she wants OP to spend the weekend doing chores and running errands? Sure, some things might need more that one person, but what is she actually doing during the working week?", "Was exactly my thought.", "There would be a few chores that could take 2 people. Bagging leaves or painting rooms or other big tasks. The small tasks like trash, sweeping, vacuuming, dusting, dishes, groceries, cooking and meal prep, yeah those are a stay at home spouses responsibility. Even when i did stay home, my husband did the bulk of the yard work because of my allergies. I'm not saying painting is a duo but it is more fun and faster with both of us.", "Yeah let\u2019s not judge it could be a large house", "You and the 730+ people that up voted you are living in a fantasy land that I would like to visit.", "This, especially when there aren\u2019t young children.", "I agree here. My husband stays at home and we will never have kids. We are childfree. But I make plenty of money for us and would prefer he has free time when I'm off to do fun things, which is also what he prefers. He does volunteer and has his own hobbies.", "What would I need a homemaker for if I spend my freetime doing chores instead of enjoying a \"made\" home?", "I think it depends what kind of chores they are. A lot of outdoor maintenance can be a two person job, or bigger things in the house (rearranging furniture, fixing stuff). If its just like, vacuuming, then yeah, that should be done already.", "you were not unemployed.  you were a free caregiver for your FIL.", "Aw, thanks. I feel like I'm getting as much as I'm giving.", "Oh, maybe if there is boredom and her mental health is improving, maybe it is time for some low stakes activities outside the house. \n\nThings like a class at a community center, volunteering, a personal project like picking up trash as she walks her favorite nature trail. \n\nAnything to have something to do outside the home. It really sounds like it is time for some activities that can be done without you there for support so they can gain some independence.\n\nIt is unreasonable to expect you to be their only outlet.", "Maybe she could consider volunteering, like one day a week, at an org whose mission is meaningful to her. Baby steps is the way to go.", "Time for her to get a job if the support of her therapist and medication are working :)", "That\u2019s why everyone sucks here. They just need to sit down and talk about it", "Eh, I'm a SAHP - to two teenagers. I'm job hunting (and have been for several months now), but I'm limited to remote work, because I don't drive for medical reasons.

A couple of hours a day is plenty for that.", "I was a SAHw/M many years ago, and the pressure to meet the expectations of your spouse is way harder than pleasing your boss or coworkers.

When I come home I assume all there would be left for us to do is eat dinner and play most days But I recognize that some chores are two person jobs and there are somethings that might need to be done that fall in my skill set but not my partner's. Like replacing faucets or whatnot", "U less the husband behaves as a child the house should not even take that.", "Well there\u2019s also the mental labor of planning meals, planning errands, etc. Stay at home spouses without kids also usually act as a personal assistant for their spouse for non work related (and even some work related) stuff", "Unless it's a mansion, 2 people do not make enough of a mess that a SAHW can't manage it during the week.", "Do you think you\u2019ll never have to do chores when someone stays at home?

Only pointing out meeting the expectations of a spouse is way more involving than a boss.", "The comments I disagree with is that It\u2019s harder to meet the expectations of a boss than a coworker.

I guess it could also be hair, nails, facials, or whatnot", "I don't think that's nonsense. I work full time and getting to the gym involves a couple hours - 15 minutes drive to the gym, 20 minute warm up, my arms and core routine takes me about 50 minutes, 15 minutes driving home.\n\nI got laid off from work yesterday and my industry experiences a Q4 slow down so it might take a couple months for me to find a new job. My partner and I discussed how we're going to handle it - he's going to take on our full mortgage ($1100 a month) and I'm going to become a temporary housewife. Because I need structure, I've been planning out my days which are going to go: Wake up and make breakfast. Spend a couple hours doing job hunting things, clean one room of the house/run errands, make lunch, go to the gym or skating for 2-3 hours.
