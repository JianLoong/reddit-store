He says \u2018there\u2019s no where to go\u2019. He then wakes me up and hour or two later saying he wants me to drop him off to see his sister. I realize I\u2019m not really sober and I was hella tired from work, so I told him just to take the car because that would be safer than me driving. Apparently he tried to update me but it wasn\u2019t going through, he\u2019s been having phone issues. But I blew up on him. I told him I understand this situation but every other one? And his sister should\u2019ve had her husband there, in my opinion that I voiced. Like why wasn\u2019t HE there? And also when I was in the ER a few months ago he \u2018couldn\u2019t make it\u2019 when I was super sick with 10/10 pain and a burst ovarian cyst. \n\nSo, AITA?

The communication in this relationship sucks. It seems like you have this really bothersome history with him of feeling unsupported and like he kind of disappears repeatedly - that is super valid and should be addressed! But trying to criticize his attempts to support his sister during a crisis is going to be like the LEAST effective time to address the real need you have, which is that he leaves for hours at a time with your car. \n\nSeparate the situation with his sister entirely. Keep your nose out of whether he husband was there or not, etc. Bring up your concerns and issues relating to his lack of communication (again, OUTSIDE of the situation with his sister), disappearing for hours at a time, taking your car, etc. Assess if this relationship even has what you want.", "I think you might be the side chick.", "Uhhm. To this man, family always comes first, and it seems like it always will. You are put on the back burner and I believe that is what you saw recently.

Classic cheater M.O.", "NTA", "YTA.  You literally offered to drive him, and then told him he should take your car when he decided to go.  I realize it\u2019s frustrating not to get updates, but it sounds like that was beyond his control.  To then pull a bait and switch where you communicate that it\u2019s fine if he goes but then later use it as a launching point to vent months\u2019 worth of pent up anger is really destructive to a relationship.", "YTA - obviously you shouldn\u2019t have driven, but I couldn\u2019t imagine letting my partner tackle a situation like that alone. Much less pass out drunk and miss the calls. \n\nDisregarding all semantics of the situation, you answered the question yourself. You blew up on him. So you\u2019re faded, didn\u2019t offer any support, missed calls, and then blew up on him?\n\nIf you reread how you wrote this out, it\u2019s a series of you falling short, followed by how you justify it. The mistakes, they\u2019re minimized. And on top of all that, you felt like you needed to drag in a scenario that is entirely separate from this situation to try and strengthen your ways of justifying it. \n\nIf you have to start pulling in incidents that are directly related to the situation, it\u2019s a subconscious cue that you feel you le argument is weak. If you justification was good. You wouldn\u2019t have to make a reach like that at the end.\n\nWith all that said, the relationship sounds pretty toxic, and I\u2019m sure he handled things about as well as you did. Adults in healthy relationships don\u2019t lose their temper and \u2018blow up\u2019 on each other \n\nYou\u2019re probably both assholes, but going off what you gave us,  I can only confirm that YTA", "ESH\n\nStrictly in relation to the specific question you asked, you\u2019re the A, because your timing is awful and your BF was doing the right thing by supporting his sister at a traumatic time for her.  Yes, her husband should have been there for her, but his failure to be there is not your BF\u2019s fault, and you\u2019ve lost any moral high ground you might have held by choosing this time to go off at him.\n\nWith all that said, your BF constantly disappearing on you in the middle of time you\u2019d planned to spend together, with minimal contact and for hours at a time because \u201csomething came up\u201d, is sketchy at best.  Unless he\u2019s like, the CEO of a major business that demands his constant attention, this is the behaviour of someone who doesn\u2019t care for you all that much and is up to something - he\u2019s acting like a drug dealer, drug user, serial cheater, or some combination of the above [EDIT: or a caped crime-fighter - thanks waterwitch009].  Honestly your whole relationship sounds like a weird toxic mess and unless there\u2019s some MAJOR context that explains him constantly abandoning you, then it\u2019s probably time to move on.", "Yta- I think the part that really pisses me off about this thing is that you're upset that he went to support his sister. Complaining about the sisters husband. Like- that his sister. Soo what if her husband is t there, he's gonna support his sister is a terrible time.", "YTA.  Would you please point out how you *don't* think you're an asshole here?\n\nYour boyfriend is also an asshole for not supporting you in the ER and for disappearing when you're trying to have a night out together, but those are both separate issues.  In this specific instance, where his sister is having a major medical crisis and your boyfriend is trying to support her, he was doing the right thing and you were being an asshole.", "ESH\n\nI am sorry but a miscarriage or possible miscarriage isn't the same as a cyst. Playing the which is more important game is unfair to both you and sister.  \n\nIf he needs to rely on other people for him to be there for you when you need him then he doesn't deserve you. Also, hospitals still have phones that people can use so he had the ability to get in touch with you but chose not to look for a reliable way to do so. \n\nIf he can't be trusted to be responsible with the car the sad reality is that he shouldn't be allowed to use it. Which is ultimately just more unfairness to you. You aren't his parent and it's not your responsibility to be one but that's the position he is putting you in.", "YTA", "You both sound weird af. You both get 'hotels sometimes'? Often enough that his issues for disappearing affect your hotel time together? Are you guys homeless? Do you guys have your own home?

Your boyfriend will drop everything for his family but nothing for you.", "ESH", "Do we know if he's usually leaving to see his family? Other than this time where he supposedly went to see his sister, it just says that he disappears for hours at a time. Yet, when OP is hospitalized, he says that he \"can't make it\". That is absolutely absurd. \n\nHe's also telling her that he's \"having phone issues \" and his updates just aren't going through. But, that seems pretty suspicious, as well, esp since he's always taking her car, preventing her from being able to leave or confirm anything he's saying. \n\nI am curious if he is actually visiting his family, at all. When his sister called with an emergency, he sounds like he was pretty nonchalant about it. Then, hours later (and coincidentally once OP was asleep and no longer sober), he all of a sudden has to take her car to run out to see her? \n\nOP you are definitely NTA. Idk what your bf is doing when he disappears. But you may have blew up bc you have a gut feeling that he is lying to you. Whether this instance was legitimate or not, he was acting very dodgy, which seems to be a regular occurrence.  \n\nI hesitate to speculate on what he could hypothetically be hiding. Obviously, cheating, money, and drugs are pretty common secrets, but it could honestly be anything. You'd know better about what seems most likely. Just know that this shady behavior isn't something you should have to put up with. \n\nStop letting him use your car. Tell him that it's an auto insurance thing and that they told you that you aren't allowed to have anyone else drive the vehicle (which is probably true, unless you've added him to your policy).", "Because his sister, his only mode of transport besides me, wouldn\u2019t take him", "I agree. Too many emergencies where your bf has to take your car and disappear for hours in the middle of the night.", "He makes her go to the hotel so he can bring his side piece into his house bc he doesn\u2019t not want the side piece know she\u2019s the side piece", "I think it\u2019s a side chick.", "Seriously.  The number of emergencies in life where you have to leap up and drive somewhere while on vacation are incredibly rare.  Either his family is prone to fits of high drama and he enables them or something else is going on.", "scammers always have a bs excuse and it's your fault.\n\nalways", "Thank you for your honesty, this is actually very helpful", "I never said I want to dump him?", "He was with me at the hotel when he got the call. We only had one vehicle with us, mine", "Funny his calls go thru when it's not her trying to reach him", "I offered him support before I went to sleep the first time, he didn\u2019t want it. And they didn\u2019t want me there at the hospital", "And he was also drinking", "Maybe he\u2019s Batman.", "I told him specifically that it wasn\u2019t about tonight. Maybe my timing was bad, yes. I just sent him some text messages basically saying I don\u2019t appreciate him leaving for 6 hours every single night we spend together.", "Are Ubers or taxis not a thing where you live? Or public transportation?", "I don't think you're an asshole at all, he is though. Did uber not exist? His sister not wanting to take him is honestly a pretty flimsy excuse, especially when he just dropped everything for her.", "lyft or uber will", "Uber anyone?\n\nPublic transportation anyone?\n\nFriends, family, neighbours, ANYONE?\n\nIf he really wanted to, he'd have found a way.\n\nALSO, is that the SAME sister he's rushing to and leaving you at the hotel for?\n\nShe didn't want to drive him to you, and you're lending your car so he can get to her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou really need to communicate about all this with him.", "Sounds like he is dating the car.

People think he has another girlfriend or a drug problem. Think about it. He receives the call, let's say the situation with his sister is true. You offer to drive him. He says no. When you're unable to drive, then he wants to go and does go. Then he's not able to keep in touch with you. \n\nNow think of all the other times it's happened.", "Girl. He has a gf and you are the side chick\u2026", "Despite my response intended to highlight the actions that are making most people call you and asshole, you immediately did it again \ud83d\ude02 I honestly think this is soemthing important for you to hear, I hope you read this.\n\nSaying \u2018he was also drinking\u2019 is not relevant to this conversation at all. You asked if you were the asshole, right? By saying \u2018he was drinking too\u2019 you\u2019re trying to imply that you\u2019re less of an asshole, because he is one too. That\u2019s not how things work. Jsut because he is an asshole, doesn\u2019t make you any less of one. It\u2019s pointless thing to say, because it doesn\u2019t change anything about you.\n\nIf you guys both robbed a bank, you got caught, he didn\u2019t. Saying \u2018well he did it too\u2019 woudknt mean they just let you go. They would just arrest him too, it wouldn\u2019t change you situation at all. It jsut makes you a tattletale on top of Being an asshole. \n\nThat\u2019s exactly what you just did, it\u2019s just trying displace accountability for your actions. That tattle tale move is soemthifn you should have learned doesn\u2019t work in like, middle school. It would serve you well to change how you handle things.\n\nBeing an asshole isn\u2019t and end of the world thing. We are all assholes. It\u2019s fine to be one. But like, own up to it. At least then your a honest asshole. Those people are dicks, but we tolerate them. What people don\u2019t tolerate is an immature stubborn asshole.\n\nI can tell by how you wrote the post, that you\u2019re not dumb. How you said \u2018I blew up on him\u2019, almost\nHad a dramatic emphasis on it. I know that you know, there was a better way to handle it. And if you knwk you coulda handled it better, there\u2019s probably a little bit of guilt, knowing there was a better way than what you chose to do.\n\nJust own it.\n\nHe can still be an asshole that deserved it, but you can say \u2018I coulda handled that better\u2019 then it\u2019s his turn to man up and own the things he coulda done better. That\u2019s how you fix a situation, and going forward, now you know how to handle it. That\u2019s growing up", "You told him to take your car even though he too was not sober? YTA.", "Thanks - edited", "Yeah your timing is what makes you the asshole.  Even if his sister and her unborn child end up being ok, hectoring your boyfriend while he's trying to comfort her is a major asshole move that makes you come off as unhinged and narcissistic.
