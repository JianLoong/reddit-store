She only lives a mile up the road from me and is on the way, so I've never asked her for a dime or accepted when she's offered me money.  From my perspective, I'm going there either way, and her overall household expenses are higher than my own, so it felt like the thing to do.\n\nOver the weekend, my car went to the shop.  I told my coworker that I wouldn't be available to give her a ride either Monday or Tuesday.  She said it wasn't a problem because her boyfriend is off this week and would give her a ride.  I asked if I could bum a ride as well.  I even offered to walk to her home so they wouldn't have to drive backwards.  She asked her boyfriend about it and he said he would, but he wanted $20 for the two days.\n\nI know it's just $20, but that set me off.  I declined the offer and said I'd find my own ride.  At work yesterday, she asked about my car.  I told her I'd be getting my car Tuesday night after work, but that going forward I'd like $30 a week (1/3 my gas costs) if she wanted to ride with me.  She was upset about this and said her boyfriend had only wanted money from me because by having me in the car he was being forced to drive straight home when he picked me up.  I pointed out that I've been happy to drive straight home to help her out for over a year and that it probably wouldn't have killed him to show me at least some level of appreciation.\n\nToday she said she'd no longer be riding with me after talking about it with her boyfriend.  She said she felt disappointed with me for holding his actions against her and that I was being petty.  A couple other coworkers told me through out the day that her boyfriend's just an asshole and she doesn't really have a say at home, but overall agreed with me that it was a dick move.  From my perspective, this dude directly benefits from me thanks to his girlfriend not needing a car of her own or spending a dime in travel, and my coworker should have defended me.\n\nDo you all think I'm being petty about this?", "created_utc": 1687294136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14emr3c/aita_for_demanding_my_coworker_pay_me_for_a_ride/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And since it\u2019s not your coworker\u2019s car, or your or you coworker\u2019s expenses, neither you nor the coworker gets a say in whether or not he asks for money in exchange for giving you a ride. You may be in a situation where you can afford to let people ride for free, but that doesn\u2019t mean that everybody is too.\n\nAnd you do have a right to make that same decision for your own vehicle, I\u2019m saying YTA based on your motivation for doing so. You had no problem allowing your coworker riding with you for free until her boyfriend\u2019s decision, which means that it was just being done as a form of revenge for a decision that she ultimately had no control over.", "If you had already established that you were refusing her offered payments previously, and you only wanted to charge her in reaction to her boyfriend being an asshole, then yes, YTA.", "Yes, you're being petty. You are holding what her bf said against her. You even said that she has offered to pay in the past so I don't think she felt entitled to getting a ride from you. This time it was her bf's car and his \"rules\". YTA.", "NTA. This is truest wild. It sounds like it\u2019s her boyfriend who is the A and not really her. But if my boyfriend made such a request after a year of literal free rides I would be mortified and would never repeat it to you.

I would have said \"Great! What a deal. $10 a day for a ride to work is a great standard price. I have drove you for 280 days, which is $2,800 dollars. Minus the $20 for these two days, you owe me $2,780. Thanks!\"", "NTA and enjoy the freedom to not always have to go straight home now", "NTA\n\nThe major transgression in this story is the co-worker asking you for the $20 for her BF. After 14 months of free rides, that is absolutely ridiculous. Whether she convinces the BF to not ask for money or pays him $20 herself is immaterial. Making the request to you is the height of rudeness and tastelessness.\n\nPersonally I think you should have refused to provide any future rides, and asking for the $30 from her could be construed as pettiness. But imo continuing to give her rides for the $30 minimizes her awful behavior more than it is an act of pettiness on your part.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re petty at all.", "Couldn\u2019t have said it any better!", "I mean how do we know she didn\u2019t?", "Came here to say that this is what the friend should have done.

There\u2019s a ton of stories just like this one on r/pettyrevenge. Most of it is just like this. Helping someone out and not getting the same in return.

I don't think she's a freeloader but could have probably handled the situation with the bf differently.", "The coworker could have just paid the $20 to her boyfriend and never said anything to OP about since she has been getting free rides to work for 14 months. \n\nIf you do a favor for someone all the time, and are shut down when you ask a favor, it changes how you view the relationship. It's not an AH move to decide to stop putting yourself out there for someone when you see that you are not unappreciated and the favors won't be reciprocated.", "Car just got out of the shop and that isn't cheap. NTA because OP can start charging because it's her car.", "That was my thought too! It\u2019s wasn\u2019t the coworker who asked it was the BF.", "She went along with the assholeness though. Instead of telling her bf asking for money is inappropriate, she texted OP pay up if you want a ride.\n\nShe would have no problem taking OP money and handing it to her bf. She's just as bad as him.", "Then she (the coworker) should have it covered for OP.", "Because either her or the bf askes OP for money. \n\nIf she spoke to her bf (if it was me) there will be two options tell him it's ridiculous to ask for money or pay the money yourself.  She did neither. She just asked OP to pay", "Why would OP expect his coworker to pay for him when he didn\u2019t even expect her to pay for herself?", "If needing to cover the cost of the repairs is the reason, OP should say that. According to his post, it\u2019s just to cover gas, but he already said earlier in the post that he had no issues not charging for gas due to being in a better financial situation.\n\nAs it stands, OP was only willing to do something nice as long as it was convenient for him, and only stopped when that was no longer the case and only based of actions his coworker could not control. Which makes it YTA, in my opinion.", "OK, then ESH.", "Maybe she would have offered to do so if OP would have accepted the ride? I dunno, I would have. Maybe she's in a bad relationship and can't stand up to her bf. I don't know that either.", "Why would OP continue to do favors for someone when they are not appreciated? \n\nOP gave 14 months of free rides to someone, and can't expect the favor to be returned for 1 week?\n\nNo need to continue the favor, when the coworker is not willing to ever reciprocate.", "I think she was wrong to transmitting the bf's request to OP at the first place. She should have offered to pay him herself if he insisted (which would be an AH move by itself), and not even mention that to OP.\n\nMy logic is: \n\n\\- You have been giving me free rides for months, saving me a significant amount of money.\n\n\\- You once need a similar favor from me. I am not able to provide it myself but a person close to me is. This person is an autonomous being and can decide that they want money for that for some reason. That is his right. However, I should realize that as you had been doing me  basically the same huge favor for quite a long time for free, it would feel a bit weird to even suggest you should be paying for that. The right thing there would be either to  convince my bf to do it for free (as you have been saving money to him as well), or if he is adamant, to cover it myself and consider myself lucky that I only have to pay  20 bucks for 14 month worth of commuting.", "Unless she is being abused by her boyfriend and literally can't come up with $20 there is no excuse good enough.", "OP is still entitled to decide whether or not he drives people for free. I just still believe his specific motivation was revenge in case and it was for a decision the coworker could not control. \n\nIf he was unhappy with being asked to pay, he should have taken it up with the boyfriend.\n\nAs it stands, the coworker is facing consequences for her boyfriends decision, and that makes OP the asshole, in my opinion.", "> The right thing there would be either to convince my bf to do it for free (as you have been saving money to him as well), or if he is adamant, to cover it myself and consider myself lucky that I only have to pay 20 bucks for 14 month worth of commuting\n\nExactly, I couldn't imagine going up to someone who's been doing me a favor for 14 months by driving me to work and asking for $20 for two days. I would have too much respect for myself and my co-worker to make that ask.    \n\nThe friend has a BF problem but lacks awareness themselves.", "You're not wrong. That's probably what should have happened and I got the impression that the coworker was apologetic. \n\nI still think that how OP reacted was petty. Her motivation was to get back at the bf but she's really just hurting the coworker. I think she could have handled it differently also. I should have probably woted ESH.", "But taking it up with the boyfriend makes no sense: OP helped the coworker, not the coworker's boyfriend. So it is the coworker who should reciprocate, and if she has a problem with her boyfriend making the request for money such that her reciprocal gesture means she has to pass him $20, that's between her and her boyfriend.", "Meh, I think co-worker is facing the consequences of their own actions. A reasonable person would have stopped and thought, wow this person has given me free rides for over a year, am I really going to ask them for $20 dollars or am I just going to cover that cost because I appreciate all they have been doing for me at no charge? \n\nThey took OP for granted, now they can't do that anymore.", "Just like it makes no sense to hold someone accountable for a decision that they have no control over. \n\nIt\u2019s not the coworker\u2019s car. She herself needs the ride from her boyfriend. And there\u2019s any number of reasons why she might not have been able to cover the $20 herself. Her own current expenses may be too high, or she and her boyfriend may have combined finances that he may control. \n\nAt the end of the day, the coworker had no say in whether or not her boyfriend asks for gas money in exchange for giving people rides in his car. And if OP doesn\u2019t like that decision, he needs ti take it up with the boyfriend.", "You\u2019re assuming the coworker was even financially able to cover the $20 when all we know is that she has higher household expenses than OP. Literally the entire reason why she was getting free rides was because of her financial situation.", ">And there\u2019s any number of reasons why she might not have been able to cover the $20 herself. Her own current expenses may be too high, or she and her boyfriend may have combined finances that he may control. \n\nAgree, but this is something that she should have talked to her boyfriend about. Of course, it's possible that we're looking at a red flag relationship in which the boyfriend is controlling etc, but that's beyond the scope of whether OP is an AH for wanting to stop helping for free when the help was not reciprocated for free.\n\n>And if OP doesn\u2019t like that decision, he needs ti take it up with the boyfriend.\n\nThat would be futile and surely you know it. The boyfriend is not wrong to ask for reimbursement, just as OP is not wrong to ask for reimbursement."]}
