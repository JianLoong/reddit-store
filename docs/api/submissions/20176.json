She only lives a mile up the road from me and is on the way, so I've never asked her for a dime or accepted when she's offered me money.  From my perspective, I'm going there either way, and her overall household expenses are higher than my own, so it felt like the thing to do.\n\nOver the weekend, my car went to the shop.  I told my coworker that I wouldn't be available to give her a ride either Monday or Tuesday.  She said it wasn't a problem because her boyfriend is off this week and would give her a ride.  I asked if I could bum a ride as well.  I even offered to walk to her home so they wouldn't have to drive backwards.  She asked her boyfriend about it and he said he would, but he wanted $20 for the two days.\n\nI know it's just $20, but that set me off.  I declined the offer and said I'd find my own ride.  At work yesterday, she asked about my car.  I told her I'd be getting my car Tuesday night after work, but that going forward I'd like $30 a week (1/3 my gas costs) if she wanted to ride with me.  She was upset about this and said her boyfriend had only wanted money from me because by having me in the car he was being forced to drive straight home when he picked me up.  I pointed out that I've been happy to drive straight home to help her out for over a year and that it probably wouldn't have killed him to show me at least some level of appreciation.\n\nToday she said she'd no longer be riding with me after talking about it with her boyfriend.  She said she felt disappointed with me for holding his actions against her and that I was being petty.  A couple other coworkers told me through out the day that her boyfriend's just an asshole and she doesn't really have a say at home, but overall agreed with me that it was a dick move.  From my perspective, this dude directly benefits from me thanks to his girlfriend not needing a car of her own or spending a dime in travel, and my coworker should have defended me.\n\nDo you all think I'm being petty about this?", "created_utc": 1687294136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14emr3c/aita_for_demanding_my_coworker_pay_me_for_a_ride/", "score": 877, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Making the request to you is the height of rudeness and tastelessness.\n\nPersonally I think you should have refused to provide any future rides, and asking for the $30 from her could be construed as pettiness.

I am not able to provide it myself but a person close to me is. This person is an autonomous being and can decide that they want money for that for some reason. That is his right. However, I should realize that as you had been doing me  basically the same huge favor for quite a long time for free, it would feel a bit weird to even suggest you should be paying for that. The right thing there would be either to  convince my bf to do it for free (as you have been saving money to him as well), or if he is adamant, to cover it myself and consider myself lucky that I only have to pay  20 bucks for 14 month worth of commuting.", "Unless she is being abused by her boyfriend and literally can't come up with $20 there is no excuse good enough.", "OP is still entitled to decide whether or not he drives people for free.

I would have too much respect for myself and my co-worker to make that ask.    \n\nThe friend has a BF problem but lacks awareness themselves.", "You're not wrong. That's probably what should have happened and I got the impression that the coworker was apologetic. \n\nI still think that how OP reacted was petty. Her motivation was to get back at the bf but she's really just hurting the coworker. I think she could have handled it differently also. I should have probably woted ESH.", "But taking it up with the boyfriend makes no sense: OP helped the coworker, not the coworker's boyfriend. So it is the coworker who should reciprocate, and if she has a problem with her boyfriend making the request for money such that her reciprocal gesture means she has to pass him $20, that's between her and her boyfriend.", "Meh, I think co-worker is facing the consequences of their own actions. A reasonable person would have stopped and thought, wow this person has given me free rides for over a year, am I really going to ask them for $20 dollars or am I just going to cover that cost because I appreciate all they have been doing for me at no charge? \n\nThey took OP for granted, now they can't do that anymore.", "Just like it makes no sense to hold someone accountable for a decision that they have no control over. \n\nIt\u2019s not the coworker\u2019s car.

Of course, it's possible that we're looking at a red flag relationship in which the boyfriend is controlling etc, but that's beyond the scope of whether OP is an AH for wanting to stop helping for free when the help was not reciprocated for free.\n\n>And if OP doesn\u2019t like that decision, he needs ti take it up with the boyfriend.\n\nThat would be futile and surely you know it.

Refusing to do favors to people who stomp on you is not called petty. It's called not being a doormat.", "NTA", "Not petty at all tbh.\n\nFuck that noise.", "NTA.  She's been using you.  But not anymore.", "Well now he can take her to work every day.  Personally, I don\u2019t like to be saddled with being someone\u2019s transportation.  I wouldn\u2019t have charged her but I would have hated every day of having to pick her up and take her home.", "NTA they\u2019re tacky as hell", "Nta op, unfortunately they are fine with using you. If my boyfriend asked someone that was helping me for money to to that for them, I would argue this with him myself, and in the last case I would pay myself and you would never know. I don\u2019t even think you are petty on doing that. But it\u2019s for them to understand on their own terms why you are doing that.", "NTA \n\nAt all\n\nYour co worker, who is NOT your friend, got what they deserved. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what/how her boyfriend acts/says. If she goes along with it then she agrees. If she doesn\u2019t then she needs to grow a backbone & stand up for herself/OP/the situation \n\nIMO, OP has learned a valuable lesson. Stay away from people who do not value your time/gas/the situation. They reap what they sow.", "NTA. But sure the boyfriend is and she is one for staying with this guy. She could have paid her bf the 20$ herself. Cheap considering how much money she saved from all your rides.", "NTA. They have saved at minimum 100s-1,000s of dollars a year in gas, having to drive her there. Or 1,000s-10,000s if she had to have her own car.", "I don\u2019t get why your coworker didn\u2019t just pay the $20 to her boyfriend herself.  After months of free rides it seems really petty of her to ask money from you and blame it on her boyfriend", "NTA. She\u2019s inconsiderate and her boyfriend is a prick.\n\nThat being said, if she sees leaves the light and finally leaves the asshole, maybe consider being the bigger person and helping her out again. It sounds like a toxic relationship and those can be difficult to leave.", "NTA. How many times have YOU been inconvenienced because you had to drive her home before you ran errands? The nerve of some people.", "NTAH, the bf just kicked the gift horse in the mouth.", "NTA\n\nShe should have paid her boyfriend if it was that big of a deal.", "NTA\n\nOp gave her transportation for over year, coworker should have just paid the $20 and said it was from OP. \n\nIt's petty but so was boyfriends requests, he didn't need for gas he just wanted it for the inconvenience.\n\nThe coworker may be pissed but it sounds like it's not the first time her jerk boyfriend ruined something for her.", "petty as a fox. the nerve of that man NTA", "NTA and it\u2019s funny how people who take advantage of others always freak out when \u201cyou\u201d (speaking in the 3rd person) treat them the same way they treat you. Don\u2019t feel bad, you gave her rides for over a year for no charge, and asked for a ride 2 days. Not a bad deal for her. She reaped what she has sown.", "NTA. He can play taxi now.", "NTA, your friend is. She may very well be in a situation that she doesn\u2019t have control of, but that is no excuse for her to NOT understand how the recent events were unfair to you. She\u2019s trying to make her problem be your problem.", "It's proper etiquette on their part to offer to pay every 2nd or 3rd ride. Especially after a long haul of not paying.\nIt's very selfish. Very rude.\nI was raised this way. And it was always appreciated.", "NTA. She got free rides for a year. She should have been offering you gas money when the prices started going up.", "I am proud of you for sticking up for yourself and asking for the money.\n\nI was in a similar situation one time. The co-worker rode with us for over a year. Even if I wasn't going in (sick), my husband would take her into the office, which added an hour to his commute (30 min from mine &her work to his office). The whole time, she gave us $5.\n\nI put a stop to it when she emailed me a list of days she needed rides. Then she called my husband by a totally different name.  Come on now. She rode with us for over a year and didn't learn his name?  Nuh uh, gravy train stopped right then.\n\nI actually had to get management involved, as she made things very difficult and hostile after that.", "NTA!!", "NTA.  You're giving her a break at $30 a week, when the going rate seems to be $10 per day.  \nShe should have stuck up for you or paid the boyfriend for you if he was being a jerk about it.  You've saved her a lot of time and money for over a year and she wasn't willing to help you out for two days.", "No. You are not. I did the same for two weeks and made things clear. $250 dollars of fuel, an extra two hours on my commute, and mileage on my truck. Better believe I got mine. Coworker didn't Welch on his end either. A silent head nod of mutual respect anytime we work together from then on.", "NTA - She can't take advantage of you and then blame you when you no longer let her. If her boyfriend doesn't \"let her have a say\" then it's up to her to get out of that situation.", "*You* were being petty? These people are delusional idiots. NTA", "Nope- the one being a Dick is the one with a Dick. Not your problem. Don't back down unless she agrees to pay for gas.", "NTA but I worry about your coworker. Bad relationship vibes.", "NTA and good riddance.  Who hitches a ride with someone for over a year and not offer to fill up the tank?  Not even once.", "Your coworker could have paid the money to her boyfriend. Easy-peasy. \n\nNTA and now you are free to do as you choose.", "NTA. She is, she should have paid the money considering.", "NTA", "It\u2019s not petty. You\u2019re Nta. \nHer free ride is over and thats that. It\u2019s not a big deal. You\u2019re only coworkers, so just keep it at that.", "Nta", "NTA... you gave her a lift for a year, if the boyfriend wanted money for 2 days ride, she can pay it as a gesture of goodwill.  She refused, free rides are over.", "Fair is fair.", "Actually, I worry about the co-worker. It sounds like she is in a bad relationship. Only a controlling jerk would make her ask for cash. I would just tell her, when she ditches the BF, you would be happy to give her rides again.", "NTA \n\nAnd I call that smart not petty!", "yep\n\nnta", "I wouldn\u2019t even say the op was petty. She is just refusing to be a doormat.", "OR, *SHE* could have paid her boyfriend the $5 a ride and thus would not have screwed *herself* out of a such a cushy situation\u2026\u2026.and now she is probably arguing with her boyfriend about how she is going to get to work everyday\u2026\u2026.l.\n\nI mean, this girl doesn\u2019t seem to be terribly bright. \n\nNTA. Well played\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd", "NTA If the coworker was so inclined she could have even paid the bf herself if he was so adamant. It\u2019s just so rude and shortsighted of the coworker.", "Petty..... Nooo", "I think she has more blame here. The boyfriend is at least going out the way and didn't gain from ops free rides. She should have paid the boyfriend and never told op about it.", "Not to mention, the coworker could\u2019ve kept quiet (out of obvious embarrassment) and payed her BF on behalf of OP", "Or she could have paid her boyfriend for the OP's ride  if he really wanted the money.", "NTA Not to mention I would have paid my boyfriend and never said a word to my coworker if he needed the money. Lamo it goes both ways.", "NOPE! NTA- she could\u2019ve just paid of the money then. You\u2019ve got out there way to help her out for a year and she couldn\u2019t help you out for two days. Does not speak well of her.", "Why is she with a man she thinks is horrible.", "She wants to free ride off OP but the moment OP needs some help for a short time, it\u2019s pay back time and a time to even profit from it. Greedy mf.", "Ah I scrolled way to far to find this. I'd itemize it.", "You made me Google bellend.  \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah she is an idiot and boyfriend a bellend. How can she be so dense and I guess self centred to screw this up so badly.", "I don't even think it is petty. $30/wk. works out to $3 / ride. That's a bargain.", "Exactly", "This! You will be so much happier without her I promise!!", "Perfect example don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you!", "Yeah, OP is NTA, but may have unleashed a lot of grief for her co-worker domestically.", "This! If there was ever a grey area this would have sorted it", "Boyfriend is not an AH because he has the right to do what he wants with it.\n\nHowever, since OP has done the favor of giving her a free ride for a year, they should continue.\n\nThat's the dumbest reasoning I have heard today.", "Especially since the price of gas is so expensive it\u2019s only right that the friend contributes to thee expense.", ">The boyfriend is at least going out the way and didn't gain from ops free rides\n\nHe gained 14 months of not having to go out of his way to pick up his own girlfriend from work...", "BF didn\u2019t have to go out of the way because OP offered to walk to gf\u2019s house.", "Completely agree", "yes she is the a-h for having an a-h for a boyfriend", "Learned bellend and mug today. Fun times", "I thought it meant that he was on the far end of a bell curve!  \n\nLive and learn. . . .", "I'm British. I have a manager called Belinda. At home, to my husband, I call her Bellenda.      \nI'm gonna fuck up at work one day, I know it...", "OP doesn\u2019t have to keep giving her rides if he doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nBut he\u2019s still the asshole for changing his mind about payment as a consequence of actions the girlfriend had no control over.\n\nThe boyfriend isn\u2019t who he was giving rides to.", "\"The EPA says that for every 100 pounds taken out of the vehicle, the fuel economy is increased by 1-2 percent. Based on a gallon of gasoline costing $2.58, this translates to savings of between $0.03-$0.05 a gallon. Of course, 100 lbs. in a small hatchback is going to make a bigger difference than those same 100 lbs. in a Tahoe, so make reasonable assumptions about what going lightweight can offer you.\"\n\nThis was written in 2016. Gas is obviously more now. Over the course of a year, coworker has cost OP money.", "No, BF would have just brought her to his own house if OP wasn't with them.", "Pillock is also a favourite word of mine", "\ud83e\udd23", "> OP was only willing to do something nice as long as it was convenient for him\n\nThat's demonstrably false as OP took the coworker to work for *fourteen months*. Nothing about that is convenient.", "The girlfriend DID have control.\n\nShe could have chosen to pay the $20 or told the bf to shut it because she owes her friend big time.", "I like it! Reminds me of bollocks. Adding it to the list", "He even states that he was willing to do because he was already going to the same place anyway and does not mention having any previous complaints about doing so. \n\nIf it was something he\u2019d already naturally been growing tired of, I\u2019d feel differently. But from the sounds of his post he had absolutely no issues with driving his coworker to work previously.", "If he's in charge of all the money it might not be easy to get that without him noticing. I had a neighbour like that growing up. We called the Police multiple times when she and her kids run to our house to get away form that man. It took years before he was in jail for other crimes and she got rid of him for a while. It was all really sad.", "Even if the coworker had talked to her boyfriend about it, that doesn\u2019t mean that she could have changed his mind. At the end of the day, she has no control over over whether or not he wants gas money in exchange for giving people rides."]}
