She only lives a mile up the road from me and is on the way, so I've never asked her for a dime or accepted when she's offered me money.  From my perspective, I'm going there either way, and her overall household expenses are higher than my own, so it felt like the thing to do.\n\nOver the weekend, my car went to the shop.  I told my coworker that I wouldn't be available to give her a ride either Monday or Tuesday.  She said it wasn't a problem because her boyfriend is off this week and would give her a ride.  I asked if I could bum a ride as well.  I even offered to walk to her home so they wouldn't have to drive backwards.  She asked her boyfriend about it and he said he would, but he wanted $20 for the two days.\n\nI know it's just $20, but that set me off.  I declined the offer and said I'd find my own ride.  At work yesterday, she asked about my car.  I told her I'd be getting my car Tuesday night after work, but that going forward I'd like $30 a week (1/3 my gas costs) if she wanted to ride with me.  She was upset about this and said her boyfriend had only wanted money from me because by having me in the car he was being forced to drive straight home when he picked me up.  I pointed out that I've been happy to drive straight home to help her out for over a year and that it probably wouldn't have killed him to show me at least some level of appreciation.\n\nToday she said she'd no longer be riding with me after talking about it with her boyfriend.  She said she felt disappointed with me for holding his actions against her and that I was being petty.  A couple other coworkers told me through out the day that her boyfriend's just an asshole and she doesn't really have a say at home, but overall agreed with me that it was a dick move.  From my perspective, this dude directly benefits from me thanks to his girlfriend not needing a car of her own or spending a dime in travel, and my coworker should have defended me.\n\nDo you all think I'm being petty about this?", "created_utc": 1687294136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14emr3c/aita_for_demanding_my_coworker_pay_me_for_a_ride/", "score": 2643, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Making the request to you is the height of rudeness and tastelessness.\n\nPersonally I think you should have refused to provide any future rides, and asking for the $30 from her could be construed as pettiness.

I am not able to provide it myself but a person close to me is. This person is an autonomous being and can decide that they want money for that for some reason. That is his right. However, I should realize that as you had been doing me  basically the same huge favor for quite a long time for free, it would feel a bit weird to even suggest you should be paying for that. The right thing there would be either to  convince my bf to do it for free (as you have been saving money to him as well), or if he is adamant, to cover it myself and consider myself lucky that I only have to pay  20 bucks for 14 month worth of commuting.", "Unless she is being abused by her boyfriend and literally can't come up with $20 there is no excuse good enough.", "OP is still entitled to decide whether or not he drives people for free.

I would have too much respect for myself and my co-worker to make that ask.    \n\nThe friend has a BF problem but lacks awareness themselves.", "You're not wrong. That's probably what should have happened and I got the impression that the coworker was apologetic. \n\nI still think that how OP reacted was petty.

I should have probably woted ESH.", "But taking it up with the boyfriend makes no sense: OP helped the coworker, not the coworker's boyfriend. So it is the coworker who should reciprocate, and if she has a problem with her boyfriend making the request for money such that her reciprocal gesture means she has to pass him $20, that's between her and her boyfriend.", "Meh, I think co-worker is facing the consequences of their own actions. A reasonable person would have stopped and thought, wow this person has given me free rides for over a year, am I really going to ask them for $20 dollars or am I just going to cover that cost because I appreciate all they have been doing for me at no charge? \n\nThey took OP for granted, now they can't do that anymore.", "Just like it makes no sense to hold someone accountable for a decision that they have no control over. \n\nIt\u2019s not the coworker\u2019s car.

Of course, it's possible that we're looking at a red flag relationship in which the boyfriend is controlling etc, but that's beyond the scope of whether OP is an AH for wanting to stop helping for free when the help was not reciprocated for free.\n\n>And if OP doesn\u2019t like that decision, he needs ti take it up with the boyfriend.\n\nThat would be futile and surely you know it.

Or at least I know my partner and I both would be.", "Couldn\u2019t have said it any better!", "How much money did they as a couple save from not needing to pay the expenses of a second car or public transport tickets, though.", "Just because it's not his job, doesn't mean he isnt an asshole for charging someone for doing something they've been doing for your girlfriend for free, for a year.   \n\nHe's an asshole for charging, she's an asshole for letting him charge OP, and she's also an asshole for passing the info along to OP, she should've just paid him herself if he wouldnt budge.", ">he was being forced to drive straight home \n\nI think they live together.", "Apparently in British vernacular it means a stupid person", "I'm Cornish and I've worked very hard to neutralise my accent as much as possible.  I speak clearly and pointedly pronounce all of my words properly, as do my children, and even my husband of 20 years has picked it up.           \nNot a single T or H gets dropped in this house, if I say Bellenda, she will hear Bellenda!", "What was the name and nickname if you don't mind ne asking? You've piqued my interest!", "Already discussed those points with other people.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to believe she would even be able to cover the $20.\n\nAnd she has no control over her boyfriend\u2019s car and whether or not other people have to cover gas", "Do you mean \"wouldn't\"?", "I mean, you can have a boyfriend and ride the bus.", " if they are not long time partners 5yr+, why would you want to take on the responsibility of driving them everyday, it would be a red flag to me, unless they shared the cost.\nNothing worse then finding yourself in a relationship after a few years with someone that leeches off you and then you find yourself in this situation where you feel guilt for wanting to break up with them but can't because they can't support themselves because you enabled them.", " if they are not long time partners 5yr+, why would you want to take on the responsibility of driving them everyday, it would be a red flag to me, unless they shared the cost.\nNothing worse then finding yourself in a relationship after a few years with someone that leeches off you and then you find yourself in this situation where you feel guilt for wanting to break up with them but can't because they can't support themselves because you enabled them.", "Hundreds maybe thousands a couple grand maybe. Definitely more than 300.", "Well, if OP says her weekly cost just for gas is $90/week, fourteen months = $5400 just for gas. \nThat doesn\u2019t include the car or maintenance. Co-worker and BF should have been more grateful. \nEspecially since OP offered to walk to their place so they wouldn\u2019t have to double back, for only two days.", "We don\u2019t know their couple dynamic. Many couples pay for themselves. They may not be at the point of joining finances. It\u2019s saved her money and benefited her. There\u2019s nothing to say it benefited him.", "I agree that he\u2019s an ah for charging OP, knowing that she\u2019s been helping his gf.

Lol. Wow.", "Mr Dougan aka \"Dougie\". Ya, I was talking to a classmate and he was behind me. I felt his firm grasp on my shoulder and I knew I was done.", "Not sure why she can't cover it.\n\nIf a grown ass woman cannot pay $20 for a year worth of rides, it's completely her own fault.\n\nIf her bf is a controlling freak who wouldn't let her do that or not let her have any financial freedom, it's again her's and the BF's fault.\n\n> And she has no control over her boyfriend\u2019s ca\n\nBut she's trying to exert pressure over OP? In what twisted planet does that make sense?\n\nBe grateful you got a year's worth of rides for free. Stop bitching about people who have been nice to you when you didn't deserve it.\n\nTo be clear, I'm saying the only AH here is the coworker. Asking me to pay your BF $20 is just another way of asking me to pay you $20 for the same thing I did for you for a year for free. It's not my place to not what financial relationship you both have.", "The coworker is not a passive participant in this story. This is her job and her partner. She doesn't lack all accountable just because she can't physically force the boyfriend not to be a rude cheapskate.\n\nShe can control how she responds to the boyfriend's ridiculous charge. She can control how she responds to OP. She can control whether or not she dates someone like that. I would be embarrassed if my significant other treated my coworker like that after they'd been helping me out for over a year.\n\nIf she can't financially pay the boyfriend $20, she could've persuaded him not to charge $20 or made a different deal/compromise with him. If she tried those things and failed, then she could have been apologetic and understanding toward OP. Instead, she was mad at OP for holding boyfriend's actions against her. Well, yes. You're a partnership. You share a household and, at least as implied by OP, finances; when you go along with his ridiculous actions, you become an accomplice. Defending the boyfriend and getting mad at OP for being upset about the boyfriend is condoning the boyfriend's actions.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that boyfriend was going to drive her to work from the same street anyway. An extra mile does not cost $20. Driving straight home is not worth $20, and probably not even a real problem. If he had somewhere to be both days, he could've said he could not do the drive home or asked if OP minded if he stopped to run x errand. We don't know because the post doesn't say why the boyfriend had such a problem with driving straight home, but it reads to me like someone who wanted to make extra money off of OP. \n\nIf coworker is so broke she can't pay $20 to her boyfriend, then boyfriend made $0 off the exact same drive and survived because it was a favor to his girlfriend. Denying OP that same kindness after he helped the girlfriend for over a year is rude and selfish. Maybe girlfriend can't literally \"control\" him, but she didn't apologize for him, either. She stood by him, condoning his rudeness. I wouldn't want to continue a relationship with people who acted that way, either. OP is NTA.", "Clearly a typo. Or they're suddenly arguing the opposite point. You decide which is more plausible.", ">A couple other coworkers told me through out the day that her boyfriend's just an asshole and she doesn't really have a say at home\n\n*Their* home", "Well thank you for the context! You're way more helpful than Google", "She\u2019s literally pressured OP into nothing. I have no clue what post you think you read, but she literally just said she was disappointed and she wouldn\u2019t be getting rides from OP anymore, which I would think would be a good thing to anyone who thinks she\u2019s the asshole. \n\nIt\u2019s still true that she is being held accountable for her boyfriend\u2019s decision. It\u2019s not her car. She doesn\u2019t get a say in whether or not a third party has to pay for gas when they get a ride. For all we know, she could have tried to talk her boyfriend out of it too, and he refused. Every way you look at it, the person responsible for asking for $20 is the boyfriend and he\u2019s the only one the issue should be taken up with.\n\nFrom the post, it seems clear the coworker does not have her own vehicle, and therefore is not capable of reciprocating the favor with free rides to work. If she going to pay OP back, it needs to be in a way that she is actually capable of doing.\n\nOP also literally states that part of why he never asked for money is because she has more household expenses. So I\u2019m not sure why you would assume she\u2019s capable of paying the $20 when OP didn\u2019t even expect her to based on her financial situation.", "Pretty sure already talked everything you\u2019ve mentioned to death. Changes nothing about my opinion.", "Its obvious she can pay the 20 since she has offered numerous times to chip in for gas.\n\nRead the post.", "And OP declined based on her financial situation, meaning that he felt it would add to her financial hardship to take the money. So he still would probably not expect her to pay her boyfriend for him if he would not expect her to pay himself."]}
