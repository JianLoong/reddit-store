Making the request to you is the height of rudeness and tastelessness.\n\nPersonally I think you should have refused to provide any future rides, and asking for the $30 from her could be construed as pettiness.

She's just as bad as him.", "Then she (the coworker) should have it covered for OP.", "Because either her or the bf askes OP for money. \n\nIf she spoke to her bf (if it was me) there will be two options tell him it's ridiculous to ask for money or pay the money yourself.  She did neither.

Which makes it YTA, in my opinion.", "OK, then ESH.", "Maybe she would have offered to do so if OP would have accepted the ride? I dunno, I would have.

She should have offered to pay him herself if he insisted (which would be an AH move by itself), and not even mention that to OP.\n\nMy logic is: \n\n\\- You have been giving me free rides for months, saving me a significant amount of money.\n\n\\- You once need a similar favor from me. I am not able to provide it myself but a person close to me is. This person is an autonomous being and can decide that they want money for that for some reason. That is his right. However, I should realize that as you had been doing me  basically the same huge favor for quite a long time for free, it would feel a bit weird to even suggest you should be paying for that. The right thing there would be either to  convince my bf to do it for free (as you have been saving money to him as well), or if he is adamant, to cover it myself and consider myself lucky that I only have to pay  20 bucks for 14 month worth of commuting.", "Unless she is being abused by her boyfriend and literally can't come up with $20 there is no excuse good enough.", "OP is still entitled to decide whether or not he drives people for free. I just still believe his specific motivation was revenge in case and it was for a decision the coworker could not control. \n\nIf he was unhappy with being asked to pay, he should have taken it up with the boyfriend.\n\nAs it stands, the coworker is facing consequences for her boyfriends decision, and that makes OP the asshole, in my opinion.", "> The right thing there would be either to convince my bf to do it for free (as you have been saving money to him as well), or if he is adamant, to cover it myself and consider myself lucky that I only have to pay 20 bucks for 14 month worth of commuting\n\nExactly, I couldn't imagine going up to someone who's been doing me a favor for 14 months by driving me to work and asking for $20 for two days. I would have too much respect for myself and my co-worker to make that ask.    \n\nThe friend has a BF problem but lacks awareness themselves.", "You're not wrong. That's probably what should have happened and I got the impression that the coworker was apologetic. \n\nI still think that how OP reacted was petty. Her motivation was to get back at the bf but she's really just hurting the coworker. I think she could have handled it differently also. I should have probably woted ESH.", "But taking it up with the boyfriend makes no sense: OP helped the coworker, not the coworker's boyfriend. So it is the coworker who should reciprocate, and if she has a problem with her boyfriend making the request for money such that her reciprocal gesture means she has to pass him $20, that's between her and her boyfriend.", "Meh, I think co-worker is facing the consequences of their own actions. A reasonable person would have stopped and thought, wow this person has given me free rides for over a year, am I really going to ask them for $20 dollars or am I just going to cover that cost because I appreciate all they have been doing for me at no charge? \n\nThey took OP for granted, now they can't do that anymore.", "Just like it makes no sense to hold someone accountable for a decision that they have no control over. \n\nIt\u2019s not the coworker\u2019s car. She herself needs the ride from her boyfriend. And there\u2019s any number of reasons why she might not have been able to cover the $20 herself. Her own current expenses may be too high, or she and her boyfriend may have combined finances that he may control. \n\nAt the end of the day, the coworker had no say in whether or not her boyfriend asks for gas money in exchange for giving people rides in his car.

Her own current expenses may be too high, or she and her boyfriend may have combined finances that he may control. \n\nAgree, but this is something that she should have talked to her boyfriend about. Of course, it's possible that we're looking at a red flag relationship in which the boyfriend is controlling etc, but that's beyond the scope of whether OP is an AH for wanting to stop helping for free when the help was not reciprocated for free.\n\n>And if OP doesn\u2019t like that decision, he needs ti take it up with the boyfriend.\n\nThat would be futile and surely you know it.

Given the circumstances, it does seem your asking for money once you were back on the road is retaliatory.\n\nBest to let the matter rest. Do not go down the rabbit hole of delving into your coworker's domestic or financial arrangements as an excuse for anything she does where you are concerned. Not your business, not your problem. Besides, the coworker will not thank anyone on the job for gossiping about her behind her back; especially if she's shown in a poor light.\n\n Leave your coworker to work out her own commuting arrangements.

I would do the same exact thing. The balls on that guy asking for money  to give you a ride for two days is beyond asshole behavior. That guy sounds like an ass and his gf is letting that behavior go on.

If she's timid, she may feel like there's nothing she can do. Nowadays I would've chewed the bf out and probably found a different ride. She still should've handled it differently but I can understand depending on her situation. \n\nAs for you, I think you should be more understanding depending on the girl.

But be sure she knows, best to say this when the bf is around so he can hear it straight from you, you were happy to help her out until HE decided she wasn\u2019t allowed to help you out. So your help is gone. He screwed this up. Nobody but him. So he can shut his mouth and drive her back and forth now. But we all know he won\u2019t do that.

It sucks that co-worker is in that situation and I sympathize with how hard it is to leave, but OP would essentially be enabling the abuse by making things less overall shitty for her co-worker. It's unfortunate that the co-worker is blaming OP for her own life choices, but there's just no winning this situation until the co-worker successfully leaves her bf. I don't think it's petty at all to ask for payment at this point.", "Unpopular truth which ill probably be downvoted for: Most people in abusive relationships *are* doormats.

Shes still an AH for obliging and passing along his ridiculous request.  Abuse would be awful but you don't just get to be an AH to other people because your partner is psycho.", "Then just give him the $20 without telling him.\n\nHonestly, I would rather take a beating than tell someone who has been doing me a favour daily for a year that they need to pay to have that favour reciprocated for two days.", "You're missing the point of the person you're replying to.\n\nUber and taxis are not public transportation. Those are separate things.\n\nPublic transportation suggests a nearby bus or train that you walk to. In most cities, it is cheaper than driving and better for the environment.

Let\u2019s do some easy math. If gas is $3 per gallon on average and the car gets 30mpg, that is $1 per mile and he is charging 10x that to a guy who drove his gf around for a year for free.

I think I kinda knew that and didn't want my comment to also be pointedly criticizing you specifically.\n\nI think I just wanted to see if you were looking down on a potential victim for not coming to that realization yet, even though your sentiment itself is totally true (well, *I* agree with it)!\n\nIt was passive aggressive, I'm sorry.\n\nAnd I hope for you to continue making progress with your healing!", "This comment always makes me laugh.

Wait there for 45 mins for the next bus, get to the next stop and walk 1 mile to my job - and show up about an hour late for work, give or take.\n\nIt\u2019s apparently a little better these days, but I remember wondering who the hell could use that public transportation system and keep their jobs.", "Wait what did you comment lol (too lazy to search for it on mobile)", "Frfr where I'm at they just shut down the entire bus line that ran through my side of town even though the closest stop was still about a quarter mile away.
