But part of that process is the recognition and and acceptance of the fact that we often don't live to the values we aspire towards.  Sometimes that process can be uncomfortable, especially when you realize you wronged others.\n\nHopefully, these guys can take the lesson that this introspection brings to continue moving forward.
