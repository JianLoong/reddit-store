He\u2019s the sweetest guy and I know he\u2019s been seriously hurt in the past and I\u2019m so happy we are finally clicking after being \u201cflirt buddies\u201d since MS (we are 25 now). \n\nwhenever we go out to eat he always orders the most basic thing\u201499% of the time it\u2019s cheeseburger plain, ketchup on the side with honey mustard to dip his fries. He actually loves exotic food but he says that menus and making choices stresses him out so he doesn\u2019t want to but thought into it. I love trying exotic things and to me that\u2019s the reason to go out to eat. To me it\u2019s so exciting. \n\nMy issue is things always look and sound better than they turn out and I decide that I actually just wanted a burger. So usually I\u2019ll ask him if he\u2019ll switch with me and he always does and he never complains. Most of the time he even says how good his food was. To me it\u2019s a win for both of us, it gets him out of his comfort zone and we don\u2019t waste food.\n\nLast night we both had to work really late so we met up at a sports bar. They were having a calamari special which sounded really good, he ordered a cheeseburger as usual. \n\nI just wasn\u2019t feeling the calamari when it came out so I asked if he\u2019d switch with me. He said no. I asked him why not and said I didn\u2019t want it to go to waste. He said then you shouldn\u2019t have ducking ordered it. I was like excuse me. He the went into a tirade and said I treat him like a garbage disposal, he\u2019s a grown man, I\u2019m being immature, don\u2019t pin my crap on him, etc\u2026 I said it sounded like that was a rehearsed speech. He said maybe it was since I \u201cinsist\u201d on stealing his food every time we go somewhere. I started crying and he (edited) said don\u2019t start that bullshit with me, here have both meals and he got up and walked out.\n\nHe has not called or texted me and it\u2019s 6am and I honestly thought he would call to apologize by now. I called my sister and near quote \u201cyou\u2019re an asshole for waking me up at 5:30 and he\u2019s going to see you as asking as insisting\u2026that\u2019s really crappy of you to put that pressure on him.\u201d And she basically hung up.\n\n\nsince she said it\u2026AITA ?\n\n\nETA: well he called and didn\u2019t even let me get a word in and said he needs a break and that he if he hasn\u2019t been happy in the first three months then the relationship isn\u2019t for him.

He\u2019s been nice over and over and you just keep pushing.", "Yta. And you didnt just ask. The moment he said no & you didn't get to manipulate the situation so you came out on top, you turn it into this. Its ridiculous  & he is 100% correct. If he wanted that, he would have ordered it. He wanted a cheeseburger, thats what he ordered. He had been politely & patiently waiting for you to realize how rude you are being, instead you just get more & more entitled. But the audacity to think he owes you an apology?!?", "YTA. And you failed to notice it wasn\u2019t a win-win for him at all. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be so upset.\n\nYou know he doesn\u2019t like the stress of ordering new stuff and he doesn\u2019t do it for himself. Then you procede to always pick new stuff and ask him to swap whenever you don\u2019t like what you ordered, visibly expecting that he will do it since you got offended the one time he said no. So basically you\u2019re pushing him into eating things he didn\u2019t want and didn\u2019t order so that you can have the plate he picked for himself, regularly. And him enjoying the meal has nothing to do with it. If I ordered my preferred pizza and if I had to eat good pasta instead, I would still find them good, that doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed the pizza more. It seems like he was just being nice to you on a few occasions and got mad rightfully when he realised this was actually a pattern.\n\nLeave the man and his food alone. If you ordered something that you didn\u2019t like, well, better luck next time and it goes to waste or you ask for a doggy bag in case he wants to taste it at some point if it\u2019s the waste that disturbs you that much. And if you want a burger, then order one.\n\nHe never asked you to get him to eat different things and certainly not ones that you would pick and that he\u2019ll have to eat in the end.\n\nPlus, if you ask and he says no, then you just have to stop asking. All the rest is actually insisting.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that you think he should be the one to apologise to you makes you an even bigger AH. You are 25, not 5. Stop ordering food if you know there's a chance you might not like it. He's not obligated to switch plates with you.", "YTA and immature twit who's routine got old quick, I think it has been more of a control thing than actually about food.", "YTA. You say you aren't insisting but question him why after he says no. What if he preferred the burger over calimari? Which was obviously the case. You're basically saying your satisfaction is more important than his. \n\nMaybe you should just start ordering what he orders.", "\" I asked if he\u2019d switch with me. He said no\" he didn't want to swap, end of, idk why you'd ask for an explanation.  \n\nYTA, eat the food you ordered if you don't want it going to waste.", "YTA and I can\u2019t believe you think he owes you and apology.", "YTA. Look, I like trying new and exotic things. And I also don't like wasting food. Sometimes when I order something, I find it not to be to my liking, well, then I suck it up and eat it anyway, cause it's just one meal. You, instead, found a convenient way to both try something and always have a back-up meal (plain burger), while having your bf pay the consequences. He probably also doesn't like the exotic food all the time, but he deals with it for your sake. So be a grown up and own to your food adventures yourself instead of making him take upon himself the consequences of not liking a certain exotic dish.", "YTA - You ordered what you wanted. He ordered what he wanted. You decided that you wanted what he wanted, and that he should trade. This has clearly happened frequently. \n\nShould he have said something earlier, instead of waiting until he hit his boiling point? Absolutely\n\nBut... come on, seriously? By your own admission, this always happens. So each time, instead of getting to enjoy the meal he *actually* wanted, he gets to tuck into whatever \"culinary cast-off\" you've provided him with this time. How on earth can you think that's normal?\n\nAnd then, for dessert, you woke up your sister at 5:30 to get her to back you up - and are clearly shocked enough when she didn't, that you posted here. Because you still clearly don't think there's anything wrong with what you did. \n\nYour attempts at culinary adventures are clearly not working, so FREAKING STOP!

He is sick of handing over his meal and getting the least favorite option to please you.\nTalk to the waiter and sort it out with the staff.\n\n \" not feeling it\" isnt a valid enough reason to swap meals with me in my book.\n\nI wonder if you really ask and deal with the consequences if he says \"no\" like a proper adult.", "He\u2019s BEEN frustrated with this behavior from that speech. I\u2019m quite annoyed for him just by reading this. YTA.", "YTA if you're doing this every time you get a dish you don't like then of course he's gonna feel like a garbage disposal because you're just giving him things you DONT want.

You need to grow up, bigtime.", "Yta. It was rehearsed because his resentment of your entitlement has been growing.", "Yta...\nYour boyfriend sounds like he might have some difficulties with anxiety. And this likely leads to him feeling a lot of pressure and stress - even when people don't mean to pressure him. Speaking from experience, your \u201crequests\u201d are most likely coming across to him as something he can\u2019t say no to and based on your reaction when he said no (he\u2019d been preparing himself to say no, most likely) you have confirmed to him that you now expect him to swap food whether he wants to or not.

So you obviously feel entitled to take whichever meal you want. He orders what he wants and it sounds like he often ends up eating whatever random food you ordered. You need to apologize, not him.

He was probably just being the kind of person who\u2019s being nice and dealing with it.

It sounds like you NEVER allow the guy to just eat his food in peace, and that would get so old after a while. \n\nSeriously, you need to apologize to him. You also need to apologize to your sister for waking her up at an ungodly hour just to share how much of an asshole you were to your boyfriend.", "YTA - I suggest you apologize to him ASAP or risk losing him", "YTA.\n\nYou sound exhausting. You usually ask him to change meals? You clearly don\u2019t enjoy trying new things as much as you may pretend you do. You think they sound exciting to order but than don\u2019t eat them.

YTA\n\nHow have you needed to trade food with him multiple times now? Yes it is rude to do that, IMO. People order what they feel like eating and usually are not going to want that food taken away and replaced by wildcard food. But more importantly, this seems to have happened many times. You've only been together 3 months. Why are you always ordering food you don't want to eat? Don't you see how annoying that would be?

You're basically ordering for him when he just wants a burger.\n\nYou're doubly TA for making such a ridiculous scene over him not wanting to eat the calamari that wasn't good enough for you over the meal he ordered. Clearly your \"asking\" was never meant to be a choice for him, plus \"not wanting it to go to waste\" was a nice guilt trip to pin on him.\n\nAnd yes, you're also TA for waking up your sister at 5:30 with this.\n\nYou owe him an apology, not the other way around. Maybe he could have communicated better but this isn't the time for tone policing. Next time if you want to try something new, try asking him before you order if he'll eat it when you decide you actually wanted a burger and fries. If he's not up for it then either you take responsibility for the wasted food or don't order it in the first place.", "YTA, if you didn\u2019t want it to go to waste you should have ate it or not ordered it.

You're so entitled you had the nerve to ask why when he said no to giving his order up lol like wow.

You did not ask. That aside, asking in the first place was rude. My guess? Probably a while back you ordered a dish that you clearly were unhappy with and your bf who you say is sweet, offered to switch. You then decided moving forward, you would take advantage of your bf's sweetness, and everytime, not even wait for him to offer, just straight up ask and he was probably too nice to say no. This time, he actually did want to eat what he ordered and he probably exploded from the frustration of realizing that you had no respect for him.

That's some weird ass controlling behavior.\n\nClearly he was being polite for a while but eventually got tired of your shit.\n\nI used to date a girl who always liked to have bites of other people's meals.

You likely ask in that annoyingly cutesy way that makes him feel like he has to go along with it to make you happy, as proven by how you reacted to the one time he said no. Clearly he didn't feel he *could* say no, and you've shown him why. You're stressing him out because you're taking the one thing he knows he can eat and is his comfort food and giving him your 'crap you don't actually want'. Yeah, I can see how he feels like a garbage disposal. You dump your unwanted food on him and take the thing he knows he wants/ordered.\n\nAnd you see nothing wrong with it.

He\u2019s the sweetest guy and I know he\u2019s been seriously hurt in the past and I\u2019m so happy we are finally clicking after being \u201cflirt buddies\u201d since MS (we are 25 now). \n\nwhenever we go out to eat he always orders the most basic thing\u201499% of the time it\u2019s cheeseburger plain, ketchup on the side with honey mustard to dip his fries. He actually loves exotic food but he says that menus and making choices stresses him out so he doesn\u2019t want to but thought into it. I love trying exotic things and to me that\u2019s the reason to go out to eat. To me it\u2019s so exciting. \n\nMy issue is things always look and sound better than they turn out and I decide that I actually just wanted a burger. So usually I\u2019ll ask him if he\u2019ll switch with me and he always does and he never complains. Most of the time he even says how good his food was. To me it\u2019s a win for both of us, it gets him out of his comfort zone and we don\u2019t waste food.\n\nLast night we both had to work really late so we met up at a sports bar. They were having a calamari special which sounded really good, he ordered a cheeseburger as usual. \n\nI just wasn\u2019t feeling the calamari when it came out so I asked if he\u2019d switch with me. He said no. I asked him why not and said I didn\u2019t want it to go to waste. He said then you shouldn\u2019t have ducking ordered it. I was like excuse me. He the went into a tirade and said I treat him like a garbage disposal, he\u2019s a grown man, I\u2019m being immature, don\u2019t pin my crap on him, etc\u2026 I said it sounded like that was a rehearsed speech. He said maybe it was since I \u201cinsist\u201d on stealing his food every time we go somewhere. I started crying and said don\u2019t start that bullshit with me, here have both meals and he got up and walked out.\n\nHe has not called or texted me and it\u2019s 6am and I honestly thought he would call to apologize by now. I called my sister and near quote \u201cyou\u2019re an asshole for waking me up at 5:30 and he\u2019s going to see you as asking as insisting\u2026that\u2019s really crappy of you to put that pressure on him.\u201d And she basically hung up.\n\n\nsince she said it\u2026AITA ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He never complained before because he wanted to keep the peace, but I\u2019m guessing this has been building for some time. He admittedly should have discussed it with you calmly a while ago, but honestly I probably would have gone off on you a long time ago.", "The moment you questioned his \"no\", you went from N A H to YTA. Maybe E S H, because he should have communicated this. \n\nYou are not a mind rader and if he didn't give any signal before that he's not ok with it, you couldn't know. But now you know that it bothers him, so stop it.\n\nAnd also, please start communicating with each other.", "YTA and a brat", "YTA could he have worded it better, yes. However, I'm on your bf side. You know what he orders, instead of ordering what he orders you go for something else on the menu then suddenly ypu don't feel like eating it. Seriously??? Have you not learned your lesson. Do you realize how frustrating that is for him? He never gets to eat the meal he orders because you are being ridiculous! You need to apologize to him and learn to work around this. Read the menu before hand, order what he orders, or just eat your meal. Stop asking him to switch.", "So your reaction to knowing he\u2019s been seriously hurt in the past is hurting him by gaslighting him?\n\nYTA.", "Clearly he feels mistreated here and in the past.

You eat with your eyes when your order even though you know from experience time and time again that you will be happier with something basic. You love \u201ctrying\u201d exotic, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you love \u201ceating\u201d exotic if you don\u2019t make it past the first couple of mouthfuls. Have you ever considered that maybe once in a while he does actually want that boring burger? Or that maybe he ALSO doesn\u2019t like what you ordered? \n\nAdditionally calling your sister at 5:30am? Wtf? Rude!\n\nSome people don\u2019t know how to say no, and some people want to provide so much for their partners they will do it to their own detriment. I can\u2019t go window shopping or online shopping with my partner - it stresses him out too much because if I point at anything and I do mean anything no matter how ridiculous or out of budget or say something along the lines of \u201cthat\u2019s cool,\u201d he feels an impulse to buy it for me. Even if I don\u2019t actually want it and am just admiring it or thinking of it for someone else, his immediate instinct is \u201cI must get that for her, she needs it\u201d. He\u2019s getting better at understanding I do not need or want everything (or even most things) I show interest in and that if I want something that\u2019s over a certain threshold amount I want him to be honest with me in the discussion about purchasing it, but he still struggles. We have no idea why he has this impulse - it sucks because I love art galleries etc and just me saying \u201coh this is gorgeous!\u201d He stresses about being able to afford it instead of just admiring it. So to protect him I have to modify my communication to be clear \u201cI don\u2019t want this, but how cool is it?\u201d Or just do my window shopping with other people. \n\nSounds like your BF is kind of facing a similar issue where he wants to make you happy even if it will make him unhappy. That\u2019s not your fault, but what is your fault is ultimately taking advantage of it (even if unintentionally). He doesn\u2019t have anything to apologize for except perhaps not telling you sooner he wasn\u2019t happy with the current meal sharing situation before it reached blowup point for him. But giving him everything you don\u2019t like is very selfish and presumptive - you\u2019re literally treating him like a trash can for food you don\u2019t like.", "Yta. My kid pulled this stunt when she was 6. She did it a couple of times, and in the end we drew a line and I told her I order food that I know I will enjoy and I expect to eat it. If she wants to try new foods, that's great but she is expected to eat it. No one will be swapping their food for hers. She never tried it again and is more considered when ordering.

Good lord, he's your boyfriend, not your daddy having to cover all your childish mistakes.", "YTA, be happy with what you order.  If he's willing to switch, fine, but never force him.  Something tells me this is a symptom of a much larger problem with you, but I can only make that as an assumption.", "YTA.  Asking occasionally might be okay but constantly asking him to switch is rude and uncouth.  And no it isn't a \"win\" for everyone.   You trying to force him out of his comfort zone is not a win, it's you being obnoxious.   When he finally reached his breaking point and told you no and snapped at you when you didn't take no as an answer you turned on the water works and tried to act like you're the victim.

Honestly yeah trying new things great for you, but your boyfriend doesn\u2019t sound like he likes trying new things as often, and you put pressure on him by asking him to trade since you both know you probably won\u2019t eat if you don\u2019t, it sounds like communication is a slight issue since he waited until he blew up to bring it up, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should avoid blame. You should apologize first.", "YTA. Damn\u2026grow up. You aren\u2019t a toddler", "YTA for that new instance. You shouldn't have pushed it tho, because him switching with you is very nice but shouldn't be the standard. And just because he did it every time, doesn't mean he always has to. If he doesn't want to, he doesn't have to. And then either you suck it up and eat or throw it away. You rather sound to have a problem with trying new food and should maybe stick to normal stuff. The amount of times this seemed to happen is crazy.\nHe's at fault because honestly if he didn't like it before he should have spoken up. Instead he behaved like it was fine and even said at times the meal was good?? And now suddenly he has hated it all this time?", "Yea YTA\n\nJust because he has been doing it doesn't mean he liked having his meal switched. Maybe he was just trying to be nice and make you happy?

Disgusting.", "YTA for this being a pattern.  Maybe once is fine, if this keeps happening you need to order a burger yourself and don't make your boyfriend part of your mistakes.", "Why the hell would he apologize when you do this every damn time?

I hope he finds someone a bit less high maintenance.\n\nYTA", "You said yourself that it was too much stress for him to decide on eating exotic foods, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s an anxiety thing.

You have been taking advantage of him taking the less stressful choice. \n\nAlso, you should have accepted his no.

It sounds like he was giving you his food out of kindness and didn't know how to tell you no because he's done it before. The fact that you clearly can't accept it when he did say no shows that he was right to worry. I'll bet his speech was rehearsed, because he knew he needed to tell you off, but didn't know how to in the moment. Good on him.", "YTA. When he said no thst should\u2019ve been the end of it. But you kept it going by questioning why he didn\u2019t want to switch meals then you start crying?? Not to mention you called your sister waking her up in the early hours of the morning over this.

He said maybe it was since I \u201cinsist\u201d on stealing his food every time we go somewhere.* \n\nHe's been thinking it, and didn't feel he could say this to you.  He hasn't been able to tell you \"no\", until now.   He wanted to, and couldn't.   It came out this time because it just never stops and he's frustrated that you do this.  Either this is something he has learned from other relationships, or this is something he learned from you and has only begun to question.  It's actually a healthy thing that he finally said 'no'.  \n\nWhen you order something, and switch with him, and tell yourself it is for his good, that's justifying you **trying to make his decisions for him.  That's manipulative behavior.**  It's a constant disrespect for him. \n\nWhen you order something and then change your mind before you actually eat it, **that's you not taking responsibility for your own actions and choices.**  After doing this two or three times, why wouldn't you just order the burger you actually end up with?   Apparently you don't actually find it as exciting as you say you do, because you keep on not eating the things you order.  This is a YOU issue, and **you might want to see a therapist to help you figure out why you are ordering things you don't want** only a few minutes later, and why you think it's okay to not eat what you order for yourself.\n\n*I started crying and said don\u2019t start that bullshit with me, here have both meals and he got up and walked out.*\n\nHe told you how he felt, and said 'no.'  **The reasonable response to this news would have been for you to apologize to him**.  It would have been you taking responsibility for what you had been doing to him.  \n\n**Instead, you got angry at him, and cried.**  That means that to you, this wasn't you asking, it was you expecting his compliance.  This is not him doing anything wrong.  If this is behavior you learned as a child, please get therapy.  \n\n\r*He has not called or texted me* \n\nOf course not.  **You owe him the apology here.**    At this point, write it out, because he might not want to talk to you for a while.  That's also reasonable.

You did.**  YTA.  You were wrong to not accept his refusal.  You were wrong to ask him why not, and to use food waste as the excuse for why he should fix your problem for you.  You were wrong to take his meals over and over and keep on ordering things you wouldn't eat when they arrived.  You were wrong to blame him for objecting to this behavior, and standing up for himself.  \n\n*I called my sister and near quote \u201cyou\u2019re an asshole for waking me up at 5:30 and he\u2019s going to see you as asking as insisting\u2026that\u2019s really crappy of you to put that pressure on him.\u201d And she basically hung up.*\n\nYour sister is right.

You weren't thinking of her when you called that early, only of yourself.  \n\nYour sister is right.  You were pressuring him to do this all along, which is why he kept agreeing, to be nice to you.

She is getting there.\n\nYou have done this multiple times in 3 months, and you are 25.\n\nDo better. Stop expecting your boyfriend to step in to mitigate your terrible decision-making and lack of learning from your mistakes.

I can see this is a problem area, given you called your sister at 5:30 AM to whine about this whole situation.\n\nJust take a second or two before you do stuff, and ask \"how does this affect anyone else? if it does?\" and act from that.

I mean asking, \"hey, do you want to trade?\" Is asking.

I think if you order something off the menu, you should want it. She wasn't feeling it just minutes later, which means she was never actually feeling it. Then to expect him to apologize. What for? Standing up for himself? She started the argument, he lost his appetite, and didn't want to be there any longer. Instead of her once apologizing, she waits for him, gets upset and decides to not let her bfs sister sleep.\n\nOP, YOU need to apologize. And it might be that he rehearsed the speech, but if that's the case it's because he doesn't feel like he can say no to you. He needs to be able to say no.
