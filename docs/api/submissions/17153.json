I told Tom to make sure to color on the paper and put some extra paper down. That wasn't good enough and Bob got up and jerked the markers out of his hands making Tom cry.

I have zero self esteem and I feel panic when my partner, who is is quite heavy footed, walks loudly across the floor because it\u2019s ingrained in me to worry that the evidence of my presence is upsetting to others. \n\nIf your husband keeps going on this way it will have a negative effect on your son, it will damage their relationship irreparably. But most importantly it will do so much damage to your child\u2019s sense of well-being. Please take it from someone who knows.", "NTA, when you are afraid to do the right thing because you fear the reaction from your husband, that means most likely an abusive dynamic.", "NTA.\n\nPlease leave your husband before he emotionally scars your son for life.", "That's called abuse. Take your kid and run. Make sure your husband only gets visitation. If he gets your son on his own for an extended period of time it'll either end in a lot of therapy sessions or a really miserable life for your kid. Good luck.", "Bob is the A\\*\\*Hole.\n\nDon't be Bob.", "This seems like a power imbalance between you both.   When you talk to your husband about the issues,  can you two find a compromise?\n\nINFO:  How old are you and your husband,  how long have you been together,  and how long married?", "Your husband is abusive. I hope you find a way to safely leave with your kid. NTA", "NTA. You are allowing a child to be a child.  Your husband wants the child to act like an adult", "NTA OP, but you will be if you don\u2019t get out of that marriage.  Bob sounds like he would physically punish Tom, given the chance.", "He\u2019s abusive and a control freak. He will continue to follow him around and look for something to comment about. Don\u2019t stay silent. And protect that child. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s shitty to hear, but it will only further damage your child. You\u2019re NTA. But Bob definitely is.", "Kinda strong, knowing very little about the situation. \n\nOP, you need to talk to him and explain why this will hurt his son. Parents who squeeze the life out of their kids with too many rules, no ability to act heir age, and intolerance of mistakes raise extremely dysfunctional adults.\n\nAsk him why. Set boundaries of your own and insist your kid be free to be young.", "Also how the f does the husband expect the toddler to gain physical and mental abilities if he's not allowed to do anything. This man has a completely backwards idea of what raising a child involves. He needs an intervention.", "Nothing borderline about it. He crossed that line.", "Yep, I grew up with a parent like this. I wasn\u2019t allowed to be a kid, every single thing I did was wrong and it fucked me up so bad and it took me till my mid twenties with lots of therapy to being to repair myself. I still have bad mental health problems because of this. \n\nMy entire childhood I assumed everything I did was wrong and that everyone will hate me for no reason and I had panic attacks if i even spilt a tiny bit of milk or something because he would scream at me and make me feel worthless. And it conditioned me to believe as a kid that if I wasn\u2019t perfect at all times I would be abused, it was hell. I developed OCD because of it and I literally could not enjoy life at all. I was self harming for a long time as well when I was a teen cause I couldn\u2019t bare it.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying OP is that I\u2019ve been your kid in this situation. It\u2019s already warping his mind and making him hate himself and the sooner you get him away from that man the better. It will only get worse and worse the older he gets and there is no way he comes out of an entire childhood of this without mental health problems similar to mine. You need to get him out now, you child is being emotionally abused.", "You need to explain to a grown ass man you don't berate, belittle and manhandle a toddler? Really?", "That's very sad but you still cannot allow him to treat your son like this.", "A surprising number of people have no understanding of child development. Conservative Christian parenting for example teaches that children are born with a sinful nature. And a lot of people just have no idea what's developmentally appropriate.\n\nThat said, if the husband doesn't straighten up instantly, I would definitely get the kid away. This does not sound good.", "All parents who do this need it explained. Yes.", "OP says the husband was raised by junkies with no rules and has a history of being controlling, so the most likely explanation is that he's just an asshole. I don't think OP should give him the benefit of the doubt to berate her into thinking being an ass to a two year old is okay.", "Then those are all some bad parents. Yes. You shouldn't need someone to tell you that two year olds don't have the awareness and motor control not to make a little mess.", "We agree. Parents too often give in to how annoying kids can be, and instead of teaching and forethought, they react in shit ways to minor things. I have three. I\u2019ve had to be reminded myself. It doesn\u2019t make a person complete shit to not know better, or to be having a bad day. They do need reminding though. What makes a person shit is not caring, being unwilling to act in the best interest of their kids, or doing it on purpose.", "Dad doesn't sound like he cares if he gets mad at OP for pointing out he was wrong. So yeah, I'd say he's shit. Also your kids will never forget any and every time you snap at them, even if you change. And they will probably hold it against you.", "LOL no. Everyone has bad days. Parents make mistakes. I don't remember every time I've ever been snapped at by my parents, just like they don't remember every time I've ever been a brat. This comment is absolutely WILD."]}
