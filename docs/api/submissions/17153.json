Me and my husband have a toddler together and he is very strict with everything he does. He wants his ever move to be watched and everything he does is just wrong to him.

Me on the other hand is a free spirit and honestly as long he isn't hurting himself or other I'm fine with him doing what ever. I have rules but no where near what his father does. This causes alot of fights between us because Bob says he always feels like the bad guy and Tom much prefers me than him. I do punish Tom when he is being bad but I am much gentler than he is and I don't just nip pick everything Tom does. Yesterday Tom was coloring with washable markers and accidentally drew on the hard floor ( no big deal since I knew it would wipe up) and Bob got angry and told me to take them away from him. I told Tom to make sure to color on the paper and put some extra paper down. That wasn't good enough and Bob got up and jerked the markers out of his hands making Tom cry. I got Mad and told him that's why Tom prefers me, Bob stormed off. Now I feel like I should have just did what he told me cause I would have done it more gently and we wouldn't have gotten into it am I in the wrong?", "created_utc": 1683999189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gnlse/aita_i_dont_agree_with_my_husband/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bob is abusive AF, get away from Bob.", "NTA, your husband has false beliefs concerning children and learning. Consider removing Tom until Bob makes changes to his treatment of both of you. Bob is using his temper to try to control you. This is not okay. Tom deserves love and guidance, not to be called bad or to feel bad about himself when he doesn't know what to do, or he makes mistakes. You deserve respect and support from Bob. There is no competition for love and safety. Tom needs it from both of you.", "NTA. Your husband is crazy\u2026 did he even want a child? Kids make mistakes, that\u2019s how they learn things.", "NTA\n\n\"Punishing\" a toddler by taking away their markers for drawing on the floor is ridiculous. The child can't connect the \"offense\" with the consequence. They can't even control their body enough to reliably stay on the paper even if they want to. He is treating a 2 year old like he is 6. \n\nHusband has unrealistic expectations across multiple domains. \n\nThis isn't a \"parenting difference\", this is a father who is angry at a toddler for being developmentally normal. \n\nI see potential red flags for child abuse all over this story. \n\nAt the very least, Dad needs a parenting class.", "NTA, Divorce that man. He sounds like a complete asshole, his expectations of a literal toddler are unreasonable and borderline abuse. Your kid is right to prefer you.", "NTA.  You are modeling good behavior.  Bob is teaching Tom to be afraid of Dad.", "NTA\n\nPlease take parenting classes together. Soon. I say together because it will 1. Make him feel like it's not a personal attack on him so he's more likely to agree to it and be truly receptive and 2. Even a fantastic parent can learn new things, it never hurts to go and see if you get anything from it. \n\nThis conflict isn't the type to magically resolve because your kid is going to develop a very different relationship with each of you, and the resentment will probably just get worse. \nNot to mention how hard it is to be a kid having to live by two sets of rules in their own house, or growing up so afraid to make a mistake that they don't try things or that it makes them doubt their value and the ability of people to love them when they're imperfect.", "NTA. It's a toddler, not a child, teen, or adult. They don't know better or don't have self control. Expecting that from toddler is mean and stupid.\n\nYou can teach your kid to behave but rememeber they don't know anything and that's OK.", "Geez. NTA. First, you don\u2019t have to do what your husband wants you to do. Second, your child needs a safe place to make mistakes and learn from them. At his age, with the markers, I\u2019d say, \u201coh, no, the marker got on the floor. What can we do to prevent that? Maybe if we put some newspaper down first, yeah? Let\u2019s try that.\u201d Eventually he\u2019ll learn to identify potential problems and solve them himself. The way your husband is handling it, when it happens again (and it will), he\u2019ll hide the marks on the floor (or something similar). Or he\u2019ll develop a negative self-image because he did that bad thing again.\n\nAlso, being strict is one thing, but your husband is being really nasty to your toddler.", "NTA: Your husbands a jerk and you should not listen to him. Children deserve to be able to be kids and your husband has control issues that are going to cause this child to resent him if he keeps it up.

That way you each get each others perspective and when you talk about it the conversation can be well, so and so says in stead of I think\u2026 put a third party in the middle.\n\nYou know that what your husband is trying to m do is something a child that age can\u2019t handle. Let a book help him out with that.\n\nAnother idea: let him vet and buy the toys. I\u2019m sure he didnt know about the markers.

You sound like a good parent but your husband sounds like a mean father", "NTA. This is a HUGE, WAVING, RED FLAG. \u201cBob\u201d is willing to micromanage your child like they\u2019re a grown adult who already knows and understands the world. He\u2019s testing you to see how hard you\u2019ll push back. \n\nBe very careful OP. Men who bully children to the point of psychological mental abuse often become physical. If possible, find strong supports in your family or community and make plans to leave. This can only escalate and it could turn physical to you and your child. Start documenting incidents like this    It always starts off small because it will get worse, and the incidents will be bigger, with more severe punishments or abuse will come from \u201cBob\u201d. \n\nGood luck and be safe.", "You have to talk to your husband.

I\u2019m a teacher so obvs am used to being round kids and, similar to you, while I have boundaries I\u2019m all about encouraging kids and having fun. My hubs was brought up in a more strict environment with physical chastisement and it\u2019s taken a lot of adjustment for him. But with pointing out that my behaviour techniques produce more desired effects than being authoritarian, and it creates a happier home environment for everyone, he\u2019s adapted his behaviour management, his boundaries and his expectation. \n\nShow him this thread.

It causes more trauma to find his parents fighting as he doesn't understand what its all about, thereby creating a negative memory. You got to find some middle ground for Tom's benefit.", "ESH.  You guys need to seriously get on the same page from a parenting perspective.  Based on your version of the story, yes, your husband does seem way too strict - but it's also dysfunctional for you to openly undermine your husband in front of your son.  It doesn't seem like you're describing a situation where your husband was being abusive and the child needed to be protected; you just thought he was being too strict.\n\nThe place to have these disagreements is not in the moment in front of the kid, it's together, in counseling if necessary.", "NAH. you need to sit down and agree with your husband on parenting methods. It is fine to have different styles but you need to be consistent with your child.", "Esh. You and bob should be a team.

I know wonderful and awful people too raised by either free spirits or by strick parents. There are a lot of parenting styles that work. But it's always bad if the parenting styles of the two parents are different. Bad cop good cop is ain't right when it comes to parenting.\nI don't even plan to have a child in at elast 2 years but I already have discussed such things with my boyfriend when our relationship became serious because I had to know if we have a future together (e.g. I find it unacceptable to ever hit a child in any circumstances).\nYou should attend parenting classes together and talk a lot about your point of views and make agreements on parenting questions. These discussions should happen when both of you are calm and open for discussion. Not when your child does something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Several kids later and years of having toys all over 3 floor of the house (we moved) it is funny to look back and realise how silly it was. I am lucky that my wife had wisdom to sit down, talk it over and give me time to adjust rather than ignore my views and create conflict.  I think there were situations where I returned the favour (just ask our first daughter how much work it took for my wife to be comfortable for her to go to the mall with her friends without an adult).
