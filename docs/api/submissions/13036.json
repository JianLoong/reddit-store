In my country, the only thing that is considered joint marital assets is the \"household\", a.k.a. furniture, appliances, decor, and it gets divided equally. Everything else is owned by the person whose name is on the deed/paperwork, and the other spouse only has a claim to some compensation if the other's assets increased during the marriage, excluding any property they owned before the marriage, as well as inheritance and lottery winnings. That seems similar here, since the sister wants to own property before her marriage.", "I can see the actual talk between OP and her husband if he wouldn't know by now:\n\nOP: So anyway, tomorrow I sign the papers for a house.\n\nHusband: You do what now? \n\nOP: Buy a house with my sister.

It's just a mouthful to say so short handed most points.\n\nBut also you should tell your non-casual romantic partners no matter who they be about any major life decisions you are making. I'd say buying a house gets over that line. It often ties you to an area and creates a barrier to any major change they may become invested in if they stay with you. They don't have veto power or a vote but letting them be heard is important.", "True but what\u2019s the harm is telling the husband: hey, my sister approached me about buying a house together.

They don't have a firm budget or agreement about the split. This sounds like it's basically at \"Hell yeah, let's totally do it!\" and browsing real estate sites stage. That's not a binding commitment, even if technically you've \"agreed.\" You don't have to ask your husband to get that far IMO. Presumably the next discussion is \"Okay, let's get serious - how would this work if we did it?\" and the outcome of that discussion is a serious proposal to work through with partners.", "If you read all her posts more carefully, their finances aren't combined. Her husband owns several properties by himself, and supports her owning property of her own. She says more than once that, despite all these circumstances, she will be talking to her husband before making any purchases.

He said no because he hadn't had penis in vagina intercourse.

If you keep your finances separate, again, not his money. \n\nSince you and your sister are still in discussion mode and haven\u2019t made any decisions yet, and you were going to tell your husband at an appropriate time, I don\u2019t see why he\u2019s making a fuss. Your sister\u2019s boyfriend sounds like a controlling A-H. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with a woman owning properties separately from her husband, bought with her own money.

If you can do what you like with you income - he isn't entitled to complain but I understand its typical to discuss big decisions in advance.\n\nHowever, it sounds as though this property would be a 'running away from bad marriage lifeboat' for either / both of you.  While everybody should have their own finances, typically some conversation is involved before property investment.  Investing with your sister sounds like a lovely idea now but you don't know where your life will take you or her.  It would be wiser to make this investment solo.  I'm happy that you have the resources to make these investments on your own behalf. Is it the case that your sister has less capital than you and any more she would have put towards a joint home with her fiancee is now being directed toward this transaction with you?\n\nThat her fiances first reaction was to call your husband and 'report you' to the 'boss' is a concern.

Do you have any clue how much actually goes into buying a house or your state's laws on marital property?  Since you are married if you bought a house with your sister in a lot of states it would be considered marital property so if your sister or you couldn't make payments it effects him.  Unless you and your husband have completely separate finances it also affects him from the onset because it likely chances your share of what you bring in to pay bills, unless you are a millionaire or something.   It also affects your credit and other things.
