You\u2019d likely damage both relationships.", "I wouldn't even consider this a lie by omission, because it's too grand. A lie by omission is telling my boyfriend I took leftovers for lunch but not telling him I trashed those and got McD's. Or his bumper was dented in a hit and run while I was shopping in Walmart when the hit and run was really me backing into a pole.\n\nBuying a house is a 15-30year financial commitment. To her credit, her debt to income ratio ( which would matter if they needed a new car or wanted to buy a new home ), as well as if sister welched on her debt, OP would be on the line for the mortgage. That isn't just a small lie.\n\nTo call it a lie by omission, I feel, is a gross understatement.", "So what\u2019s his is \u201cours\u201d and what\u2019s yours is yours?", "You own savings that you are able to have because he pays for everything.

Nothing will happen until the men have been consulted.", "Daaaaaaamn, that\u2019s cold.   Christ.  \n\nOur situation wasn\u2019t similar to this, and I grant myself a little bit of blame for it (him buying a car without telling me) as well.   I\u2019m VERY indecisive about cars.  And I drove hand-me-downs for over 20 years.  We knew I NEEDED a car, but I wasn\u2019t the one pulling in the $$ although I had been at first (now combine all of those last sentences together).   I can very honestly tell you that my (then fianc\u00e9, now husband) probably got fed up with it and bought what he did, passing his \u201cold\u201d car to ME, which was $Free.99!! That also cranked and took you places!  With no car payment!  Which would have been FINE if he\u2019d just told me first.  \n\nThat was in\u2026 2017 maybe?  I can\u2019t remember now, but I drove that (hand-me-down) into the dust.   And a little over a year ago, realized:  the hand-me-down (x3 or 4) is no longer reliable and I need to BUY SOMETHING.  I had 2 requirements:  AWD OR 4WD, and a stick shift.   \n\nThank GOD there was ONE option available with both features in \u201cmy\u201d price range-  a Subaru Crosstrek.  Otherwise, we\u2019d probably STILL be pumping money into the beater while I tried to make up my mind.   \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your experience.  But also a bit more grateful that mine wasn\u2019t toxic;  it might have pissed me off at the time but it was logically sound.  (And it\u2019s also fun to toss out on occasion\u2014- \u201cYou mean that time you bought a WHOLE CAR  without telling me!?!?\u201d)", "Your examples are just lies.

He encourages this, and even tells her she should have her separate assets. He\u2019s mad BECAUSE she didn\u2019t even bother to tell him she\u2019s LOOKING. How long does it take to tell your partner that? \n\nWhen was she gonna tell him? When they were gonna pay for the property? After they paid for the property? This is a HUGE financial decision that her spouse should know about.\n\nBut no, blame the men in everything \ud83d\udc80", "It is so selfish of you to think of investing in a property  with someone else withouth tellkng your husband.

Gotcha", "Info: why are you and he not looking to buy property if you don\u2019t already? Has he stated he never wants to be a homeowner?", "That seems harsh, depends on the value of things. If husband makes 200k / year and expenses for both of them are 100k / year and OP only makes 50k/year that she keeps, then OP has 50k to spend and husband has 100k. \n\nIf they had all joint accounts instead and it goes into the same pool, then splitting the excess in half which means OP actually gets more money than just keeping her own.\n\nOr if they split proportional to income instead, the OP pays 20k and has 30k leftover, husband pays 80k and had 120k leftover. Obviously theoretical numbers, but point is that whether she's a leech is depends heavily on specifics that we don't know and the husband could just as easily have even more of his own money to himself than OP has to herself", "It\u2019s not just OP who is the AH.

My husband bought our previous house before we were married.  We refinanced and put my name on the deed after we got married.", "Hi sorry about the long disappearance, so what I\u2019m getting is that this would be a no gain purchase as I\u2019m assuming you wouldn\u2019t be charging your mother to live there correct? An investment means you would earn on it, but paying for someone else\u2019s living expenses is not an investment. While that is a nice gesture the fact that he\u2019s paying for what I\u2019d assume would be 90-100 percent of your current living cost (home, utilities, food, etc.) the extra money you put into saving should have been split at least a little between that and any joint accounts. Add the fact you had already looked at houses on the market while still keeping it secret does come off as shady at the very least. He has every right to be upset about it as well as owning a house with a relative can cause some serious issues later on. Things like repairs, or who covers what and even if both are properly represented in ownership and insurance policies. I\u2019d have to go with YTA mostly for keeping it hidden from your husband. Hopefully you guys can work on a better investment plan, especially with the current market situation."]}
