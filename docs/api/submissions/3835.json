{"id": 3835, "submission_id": "zbb1hh", "title": "AITA for rating my ex a 5/10?", "selftext": "My (23M) friend Matt (22M) threw a party for his birthday  and said he really wanted me to be there. I knew my ex (22F) was going to be there, but I thought it was an actual \u201cparty\u201d with lots of people so we wouldn\u2019t have to interact. I couldn\u2019t bring a plus one because all my current friends can\u2019t stand Matt\u2019s friend group. \n\nWhen I arrived, instead of a party it was a kickback with just his friend group. For background, I met this group, which includes my ex, two years ago when I\u2019d just moved to the city and knew nobody. They were all friends from college but included me in the group right away. My ex asked me out a few months later and we dated for almost a year. After she broke up with me the energy from the friend group made me feel very unwelcome and uncomfortable. It was very isolating because I didn\u2019t know anyone else but I had to distance myself and I hadn\u2019t seen them in months until this party. However, Matt and I still hung out one on one. \n\nAt the party someone suggested this drinking game called \u201chot seat.\u201d For a minute, the person on the hot seat has to answer any question they\u2019re asked or take a shot. When I was on the hot seat, I got asked uncomfortable questions about my relationship with my ex right away and kept opting for the shot. I was pretty plastered already and had to stop and just answer questions cause I felt sick and they were asking the questions very rapid fire.\n\nSomeone asked me who the hottest person in the room was, and I chose one of the guys in the room as a safe neutral option. Then someone asked me to rate my ex out of 10. I rated her a 5 and they asked, \u201cso below average?\u201d I responded that no, a 5 is the average. They followed up with, \u201cif you thought she was a 5, why did you date her?\u201d I responded that looks aren\u2019t everything. At this point, my ex storms out of the room. The energy became incredibly awkward and I left soon after. \n\nThe next day I called Matt and apologized for how awkward everything and he seemed pretty pissed and complained that he\u2019s had to deal with the aftermath of my ex being upset. I get the feeling that everyone involved thinks I was an asshole here but I don\u2019t know what else I could have done. A 5 isn\u2019t that bad and if I\u2019d rated her higher they\u2019d probably use that to make fun of me and say I\u2019m not over her. I asked my friends and they say I\u2019m not the asshole but I think they\u2019re pretty biased since they hate the group that was at the party.", "created_utc": 1670054030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbb1hh/aita_for_rating_my_ex_a_510/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you're referring to the second question, I just find rating other people pretty gross but, that's just me.", "It doesn't matter if he hurt her feelings. If she's a 5, she's a 5. If she cannot handle the truth, she has a lot of work to do on herself. And she could even intervene to stop the game. But she didn't, she wanted to hear what OO had to say: what it's mean and shltty is shooting OP question after question about his ex and their relationship, and that includes her.\n\nAs OP explained in the post, no wonder people don't want to hung out with such a band of morons", "Or OP could've stopped the game and chosen not to answer a question that could potentially hurt her feelings. Sure, noone is entitled to kindness but, it would've cost him nothing to not say anything. You're entitled to your opinions though"]}
