You should have talked to your sister and BIL in private not in front of the child and you should not have yelled at the child. as frustratig as it is, it really is up to them to parent her not you. I understand why you didn't, but in this situation the most ideal way to handle it would have been to hold out then talk to your sisters in private abut what had happened. I feel like they wouldn't listen because they're convince she's \"born that way\" and understand that they reject any input as you are not a parent...\n\nHonestly what you did was understandable and your sister and BIL seriously needs to step up or it will be hurtful for their daughters future aswell.", "ESH\n\nI can understand your anger, but yelling at the spoiled brat was probably uncalled for.

It took for me to check her for her to realize she couldn\u2019t always get her way. If OP was constantly yelling then I can see your POV. But the girl was kicking her stuff and cursing at her mom. If niceness worked with the neice then I\u2019m sure OP would\u2019ve went that route. There\u2019s a reason the neice doesn\u2019t disrespect Op is because she doesn\u2019t take her crap. After 10 years of being rude and entitled, the neice is lucky she only got yelled at. These children grow up to be bullies when not checked. My friends kid turned out to be a huge bully because she always had to get her way. It got to the point where her own mom was scared of her.
