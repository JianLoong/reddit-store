You should have talked to your sister and BIL in private not in front of the child and you should not have yelled at the child. as frustratig as it is, it really is up to them to parent her not you. I understand why you didn't, but in this situation the most ideal way to handle it would have been to hold out then talk to your sisters in private abut what had happened. I feel like they wouldn't listen because they're convince she's \"born that way\" and understand that they reject any input as you are not a parent...\n\nHonestly what you did was understandable and your sister and BIL seriously needs to step up or it will be hurtful for their daughters future aswell.", "ESH\n\nI can understand your anger, but yelling at the spoiled brat was probably uncalled for.

It took for me to check her for her to realize she couldn\u2019t always get her way. If OP was constantly yelling then I can see your POV. But the girl was kicking her stuff and cursing at her mom. If niceness worked with the neice then I\u2019m sure OP would\u2019ve went that route. There\u2019s a reason the neice doesn\u2019t disrespect Op is because she doesn\u2019t take her crap. After 10 years of being rude and entitled, the neice is lucky she only got yelled at. These children grow up to be bullies when not checked.

In the moment, I doubt it was out of line. NTA. Your niece needs some serious discipline and maybe they need family counseling to help them all learn to respect other people.

Who the hell is she to cone into YOUR home and start kicking furniture at 14??? Your sister is spineless and a pathetic parent to allow this and then defend abhorrent behavior. She absolutely had it coming. Make sure she know to act right or do not enter my home. This might cause a rift with your sister but you are 100% right.

She needs to learn that not everyone will \"gentle parent\" her. I myself don't like the screaming technique with my son but there are so much ways to parent a child like this but I fear they may be to late and they will have to deal with the aftermath of her behavior because in no way is it acceptable to tell your mother to move her fucking ass.

I have taught kids from ages 12-23 and sometimes yelling is necessary as it\u2019s the only thing they will pay any attention to. If it\u2019s your only way of dealing with them then that\u2019s bad and your problem but any adult who thinks young people never deserve to be yelled at are delusional.

I hate this idea that we have to speak gently in all situations. Not everyone deserves that.", "Yelling isn't the way to handle things but not because she didn't deserve it. Losing control and yelling to solve a problem teaches others to do the same. Certainly we don't want to encourage a world like that.

She's a pain.\n\nIf you had yelled at an 8 year old or 10 year old, I'd agree that the yelling was out of line.\n\nYou didn't. \n\nYou yelled at a 14 year old who was being destructive with your stuff, in your home, as well as being HIGHLY disrespectful to you and her mother in your home. This is a reasonable reason to yell to get her attention.\n\nSometimes teens respond better to shock than anything else.

But her entire life goals consist of that. Just that. That's the part I take issue with. Don't get me wrong, I don't really have big goals either, so I'm definitely not saying she needs to have big dreams in life. The problem with her is that from what my mom's told me about her, she doesn't even have the work ethic to be either of those things. She expects everything to be handed to her on a silver platter. Having been a waitress myself, all I can do is laugh at the wake-up call she'd get. But considering we're now almost 30, and she still (to my knowledge) has never worked a day in her life, I really don't see her achieving those goals. Her mother caters to her just like the mother in this post does. If she doesn't get what she wants, she has full-blown tantrums.

It's not a huge jump to think that an entitled teenaged girl who kicks others' belongings might graduate to physically assaulting a partner as well.
