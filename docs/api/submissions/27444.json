My girlfriend (29F) expects me (28M) to pay for everything, including expensive dinners, activities, and items she buys when she's with me.\n\nI am in my last year of law school with a full scholarship but am taking out loans for living costs. She is in healthcare and voluntarily works only 2 days a week. I don't know what she makes, but I'm positive she could make 110k+ if she worked 5 days a week (not that I care about her salary though). She's only been in one relationship before and that guy made 180k+ (just guessing based on his profession).\n\nExamples:\n\n* A lot of the restaurants we go to are pretty expensive. She suggests them. I've always paid and she's offered to pay once. I asked her later if I let her pay for it, would she have been dissapointed and she said yes. She's down to go to cheaper places as well / food trucks, but likes trying new restaurants, which tend to be higher priced.\n* She wants to go to Universal Studios instead of Knotts because Knotts is ... I forgot the exact phrasing she used, but the general sentiment was she thought it was too \"ghetto\" (didn't use that word though). I'm sure she expects me to pay for the tix. I don't care about the preference of Universal over Knotts (lol), but just showing she has high tastes. She's said she's traditional and expects the guy to pay.\n* I pay for all activities.\n* We were at my school store and she said she wanted something ($20). She bought it and I didn't offer to pay for it. But I later asked her if she was disappointed I didn't offer to pay for it  and she laughed and \"said yes, but it's okay\" (part of the same convo in point one, just in case you think I keep asking her if she was dissapointed LOL)\n* I randomly read about this \"love language\" concept and we went through them, and she ranked \"gift giving\" as her highest one.\n* She had a death in the family and all her friends sent her flowers. Later she brought up the topic of why I didn't get her flowers.\n\nWe have been seeing each other for 4 months, but she's serious and has made comments hinting about marriage. She has driven 2 hours in traffic to tend to me when I had COVID (cooked for me, got stuff from the store etc.), has introduced me to her entire family and friends, told her mom she wants to marry me etc. We don't go out all the time - a lot of the time we just stay at home to chill.  She randomly sends me paragraphs of text with heartfelt stuff.  She said she wouldn't want an expensive wedding at all, but rather a really small thing. She is legitimately a caring girl. I said this stuff in case you guys think she's using me. (previously wrote \"gold digger\" instead of \"using me\" - that was the wrong phrasing LOL) \n\n\\*This is getting too expensive for me.

Communicating about financial situations is a normal part of a healthy relationship, and setting those expectations early on can help avoid any uncomfortable tension when it comes to things like this. It is rather unfair of her to expect you to pay for everything when she is capable of contributing.", "NTA. Have the conversation from an open and honest place. And if she says she\u2019s not ok with that, then she wasn\u2019t the one for you anyway.", "Bro, just tell her straight up. Ain't no shame in not being able to afford everything all the time. Plus, she's got a job too so it's only fair for her to chip in sometimes.", "It's not 100% clear from what you've written if she really \\*expects\\* you to pay for everything or if you've silently adopted that burden for yourself. Anyway, if she really was a \"gold digger\" (or realistically, looking for a relationship where her partner can shoulder the majority of the financial weight), she has her priorities out of whack by dating a grad student. My boyfriend is also a grad student, and I cringe at the thought of making or expecting him to pay for everything (especially as things currently are). Just tactfully communicate with her.\n\nNAH", "YWNBTA\n\nRelationships are supposed to be balanced for both parties, including financially.  It\u2019s not appropriate for her to expect you to pay for literally everything, especially luxuries such as theme park tickets and expensive restaurants.  It\u2019s more than reasonable for you to expect her to pay her way, especially if she is the one who wants to do this stuff.  \n\nExceptions of course exist for events like birthdays, graduations, etc.  But only if you could afford it.  It\u2019s clear you\u2019ve said you can\u2019t.  YWNBTA here.\n\nI would discuss this directly with her and tell her that it\u2019s not appropriate for her to expect you to pay for everything and that you can\u2019t do that anymore.  Depending on her reaction, you might want to consider whether the relationship is worth going forward and whether you want to keep dealing with the issue.  Ultimately that would be your decision.", "NTA. I think in your position it's okay to express that you don't want to spend that much money on her. Especially because you are not in a role where you make more or equal money to her. \n\nThat being said, I'm sure she isn't a gold digger but she probably has different expectations in a relationship than you do. I have a friend who only dates men who are financially stable, bc she is financially stable herself and will not even consider dating someone who would not pay for her things. It's a reality of living in a patriarchal society and redditors hate to hear this but sometimes women have expectations of men like paying for things because they are given better and higher paid jobs. So even though you in particular are not making as much as she could potentially be, because you are the man in the relationship she may expect more of you. Women often like men who can provide for them.", "NTA. I suspect she\u2019ll say it\u2019s okay but I think it won\u2019t be. Don\u2019t saddle yourself with someone who can\u2019t live within their/your means. Excessive debt can destroy a good life.", "NTA, just sit her down and have a very clear and concise discussion with her.  \n\nYou have been seeing her for 3 months, imagine what she is going to be like in 3 years after you are done with school.  She won't be working and expecting you to do everything.\n\nYou should take her to COSTCO buy her a hotdog and soda. Then tell her this is what you can afford as a student.", "NTA, but is she aware of your situation? Maybe she doesn\u2019t realize you\u2019re taking out loans for living costs and if you\u2019ve only been dating 4 months it\u2019s pretty common for the guy to be paying for most things unless you\u2019ve had a conversation about it. Just let her know you can\u2019t afford to go out a lot right now but that it\u2019s not because you don\u2019t appreciate her presence and you guys can go on more chill dates (if she\u2019s not okay with that just move on tbh). As for the gift-giving being her love language, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to buy expensive things, it\u2019s more about her knowing you\u2019re thinking of her. You can make her stuff, buy her flowers, a pastry, it\u2019s really the little things.", "NTA. Have you had the talk with her? Why do you keep asking her if she\u2019s disappointed you didn\u2019t pay for things? I think if you are serious, you guys need to sit down and you can explain that you don\u2019t have the type of money to keep paying for extravagant things. \n\nMaybe see if she wouldn\u2019t mind splitting the bill at nice restaurants. My boyfriend makes more than me, so when we go out to eat he usually pays, but if it was an expensive dinner I\u2019ll cover drinks and tip, or if we\u2019re on vacation and going out to multiple restaurants I\u2019ll get lunch he gets dinner. Or I\u2019ll get gas if we\u2019re going on a day trip somewhere and he\u2019s paid tickets. Stuff like that. \n\nIf her love language is gift giving, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend a ton of money on her. Sometimes something thoughtful and small can be special. Like if you\u2019re out grabbing groceries, grab a bag of her favorite candy to surprise her with next time you\u2019re hanging out. My boyfriend knows I have a sweet tooth and there\u2019s been times I\u2019d look in his pantry and not see any sweets, only for him to reach up to the top shelf and bring down a bag of gummies or a chocolate bar he got for me as an \u201cemergency sweet snack\u201d. Such a small thing but it means more than anything fancy that he thought of me. Or if he was at the farther mall, he\u2019ll stop in at lush and grab me a new bath bomb. \n\nMy point being, little things that show you\u2019re randomly thinking of someone can really brighten their day. It doesn\u2019t have to be fancy meals, flower and jewelry. \n\nAnd if she isn\u2019t cool with it, then maybe that\u2019s a sign you\u2019re not compatible. And that\u2019s okay too, but it\u2019s better to know now than later", "Good for you for going to school and continuing your education to have a great career someday soon! You 100% would not be TA if u have boundaries of what you can and cannot afford.

This is where you need to see what she\u2019s made of in terms of potential wife material-will she respect when you say I can\u2019t afford to pay everything all the time right now?

I am always floored that there are other women out there that expect men they\u2019re dating to pay for everything when they\u2019re together because they\u2019re men. \n\nRather than making it about not wanting to pay, talk about your financial realities. Maybe say that you are assessing your living expenses because you have been spending too much as an excuse for bringing it up now. \n\nIf she gets upset then you\u2019re seeing true colors and should think hard about whether she is someone you want to be with.", "NTA. Tell her you need to start budgeting \nand you have to cut down on money spent on eating out and activities.", "NTA  \n\n\nRelationships are supposed to be two people working together to create a happy healthy life together.

I asked her whether she wanted to be my equal and split everything or have me pay for everything and be my property. Without hesitation she said \"property!\".
