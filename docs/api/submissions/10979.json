Tell bridezilla to take it or leave it.", "**NTA**\n\nThere's absolutely no reason why the bride's mother should even HAVE to touch up your colour before the wedding. What if you're not due to have your colour done then? And it sounds like her mother is the sort of horrifying stylist who doesn't listen to or collaborate with her clients. I wouldn't trust someone like that anywhere near my head. \n\nA bride has the reasonable right to ask her bridesmaids to STYLE their hair in a particular way for the wedding - updos, braided, half-up, whatever - to look a particular way FOR THAT DAY, temporarily. She has no right to demand that you change your colour, cut, or anything else long-lasting, and she certainly cannot demand that you allow her mother to BLEACH your hair if that isn't something you normally do. Yikes yikes yikes. Absolutely not. You are NTA, but that whole family are.", "NTA\n\nThis is your hair.  Your body.  She wants to be picky about the look, that\u2019s fine.

The bride doesn\u2019t get to choose who does your hair.", "NTA. Most people who see a colorist ONLY see that colorist.", "NTA. I was told by my stylist that not all stylists can color hair nor can all colorists cut hair. If you find the rare gem who can do both and do them well, you hold on to them for dear life. I have friend who does both my cut and color, and another gal I see for in between cuts (friend is high in demand). It was the latter of the two who imparted that wisdom on me.\n\nHonestly, I'm a little suspect of the bride's mother. The fact that she keeps referring to \"bleaching\" your hair. It sounds like that your stylist may be using highlights and lowlights in your hair, which just bleaching it would destroy the effect you and your stylist want. She may also damage your hair in her process (cause it's not like hair coloring techniques and products have changed since mom was in school/s). \n\nNo, you have every right to ask your stylist to do your hair for the wedding.

Conversation ends there. You have a stylist who is able to touch up your hair as needed before the wedding, and so there should be no argument.

I've known her 20 years, I know she's careful and good at her job. It's on my head, so I say what happens to it and who touches it.", "NTA I\u2019m a former hair stylist who specialized in blondes. This is a hill to die on. I have seen some bad blonde jobs that have extremely damaged hair. I have even had clients try someone else out who charges less and have had to come back to me and spend even more money on fixing it and losing a lot of length in the process because we had to cut the fried parts off so it doesn\u2019t break even more. \n\nINFO: why can\u2019t you make any appointment with Sammy to touch up your color before? Are they trying to shut that down?", "Surely there is a way to meet in the middle here. Make an appointment to see Sammy to get your color touched up a few days before the wedding, then you can still go to her mom for styling for the wedding itself. Overall NTA, I would never let someone I have no knowledge of their work do my hair and I have easy hair. Just find a way to compromise.
