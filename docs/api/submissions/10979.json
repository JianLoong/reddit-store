What if you're not due to have your colour done then? And it sounds like her mother is the sort of horrifying stylist who doesn't listen to or collaborate with her clients. I wouldn't trust someone like that anywhere near my head. \n\nA bride has the reasonable right to ask her bridesmaids to STYLE their hair in a particular way for the wedding - updos, braided, half-up, whatever - to look a particular way FOR THAT DAY, temporarily. She has no right to demand that you change your colour, cut, or anything else long-lasting, and she certainly cannot demand that you allow her mother to BLEACH your hair if that isn't something you normally do.

It was the latter of the two who imparted that wisdom on me.\n\nHonestly, I'm a little suspect of the bride's mother. The fact that she keeps referring to \"bleaching\" your hair. It sounds like that your stylist may be using highlights and lowlights in your hair, which just bleaching it would destroy the effect you and your stylist want. She may also damage your hair in her process (cause it's not like hair coloring techniques and products have changed since mom was in school/s). \n\nNo, you have every right to ask your stylist to do your hair for the wedding.
