I don't think he fully realizes how nutty OP's family is.  Because of this:\n\n>He also said I'm a bit of an AH for telling Ryan all that without clearing it with Mom first, because that will just make things harder for him. \n\n\"Clearing it with Mom\" is something done in a normal family situation.  This is not a normal family situation.  OP is the co-parent.  But since this was OP's old room and her stuff, she shouldn't have to clear it with mom.\n\nIf anything, boyfriend is severely underestimating how messed up this family is.", "It's probably a bigger room. I wouldn't read much into that.", "Do whatever you can to help the 17 brother escape like you have been.", "He can do that without having room he can decorate however. Really. Living in someone elses room wont harm him at all. It might push many people to get independent, but also many people just don't mind that stuff. (Like, I dont much. I dont personalize spaces even when I have a choice.)\n\nBeing long term unemployed will harm him. But, that has nothing to do with room.", "Amen to that."]}
