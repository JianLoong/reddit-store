It's not right that you should basically be forced to chose from being completely estranged from your family or assuming all the responsibilities that your mom refuses to do as a parent. If it's not too much of a burden or stressor on you, fight to stay in your youngest brothers life and help him be mentally and financially independent from your mother as much as you can without getting sucked in. Otherwise I would continue with minimal contact and practicing strong boundaries so your mom doesn't rope you back into your abuse.

There is no reason to keep your old room as your old room. The fact your mother tried to raise you as the house mom, including as her own, is psychotic. She wants you to be the parent while she pretends to be the cool older sister. Work towards being an OLDER SISTER to your siblings by doing fun stuff for your siblings and offering advice/help when they ask.

It won't work from a distance any more than it would if you lived in the same house.\n\nSending money beyond a few dollars might have the siblings strong-armed to hand it over. Needed items that she can't sell will probably be better.\n\nYou are best giving your siblings opportunities to maximize their choices like helping with bus fares to college or work, searching for inexpensive/secondhand items they need (text books/clothes) online which can be sent to a PO box/parcel collect point they can access. If you buy online and ship direct to the siblings request from the seller that NO INVOICE IS INCLUDED (stops refunds). \n\nIf you can afford bigger things then paying a sibs car insurance/medications/drivers licence cost etc can be good early birthday/Christmas presents. \n\nValuable things that don't cost? **Be the voice of normality in their lives.**\n\nRegular chats provide a way for you to subtly challenge their experience of 'normal'. Be sure to tell them of the positive things available to you now. *Don't hold back in fear of making them feel envious/sad/angry/resentful because those feelings can be effective motivators to help push them to make change in their lives.* You being the enemy sometimes is useful. Altruism is accepting that discomfort knowing that the longterm benefits for the siblings outweigh the cost to you. \n\nI know it's tempting to call your mother and try to open her mind and improve things in that house, but she's been this person longer than you've been alive. You just can't do it. Instead focus on having a superficial cordial relationship which enables you access to your siblings and allows you to be alert to issues you might want to address with/for them.
