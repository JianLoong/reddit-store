Cool, I quickly forgot about it.\n\nRyan called me the other day asking if I could help him with college apps. I happily agreed, but when we went on the Zoom call, I saw he was in *my* room.

Same posters, same bedspread, even the cardboard boxes filled with old clothes clearly labeled \"THROW AWAY.\" Frankly, I was freaked out. I asked Ryan why he hadn't redecorated, and he said Mom won't let him, that I'll eventually move back into that room and he'd go back to his old one. I was pissed. I managed to get through his college questions and had to lay down. That night, I texted Ryan asking if he had a PayPal or something, and that I would send him money to buy new stuff and to PLEASE get rid of my old stuff because I am not coming back, and that was his room now.\n\nThe next day, I called Mom and told her what I told Ryan, and that it was messed up that she let him live in my room without changing it. She blew up at me, saying I was a selfish AH and that I can't have it both ways: either I'm not responsible for the kids, and I should butt out, or I am responsible and I need to own up to abandoning them. This has stuck in my craw ever since: I do think it's super weird, but if Ryan's been living like that without complaint, am I just getting involved unnecessarily? I quite plainly said that I don't want to be responsible for the family anymore, but here I am telling them how to live. My partner says that he kind of agrees with Mom, in that I should just drop my relationship with my family because I'll inevitably try to take responsibility for them, when all that will do is cause pain on both sides.

Your mom has both turned you into her co-parent in her mind to a wild extreme (NOT okay) and has a very disturbing and unrealistic want to have everyone stay children and the same, in her house, forever. Her job is to raise capable adults who start their own lives, but that\u2019s not what she thinks it is. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that she\u2019s making you feel like the bad guy here. Having a loving and supportive relationship with your siblings from afar is HEALTHY and NORMAL. The only options shouldn\u2019t be \u201cin her house and fully responsible for them as a parent\u201d or NC. That\u2019s nuts.\n\nEdited for typos.", "You're right to be freaked out by the frozen-in-time bedroom. That's sometimes done when a while dies... not when they simply move out. That's insane.\n\nAnd she's attempted to groom you into the parent while she gets to act like a child. She needs intense mental help.\n\nNTA by any stretch of the imagination. I think if your brother seems okay with it, he may actually be trying to emotionally distance himself from the reality of it. Also, because you're the responsible one instead of mom, he may be comforted by being surrounded by your belongings.", "Question-Foes the 25 year old and 19 year old ever escape?

Why are you supposed to be responsible for 3 other adults? I get that the youngest is still 17, and might want to come to you for advice, but it sounds like your mom wants you to act like a full parent to all of them FOREVER... Why? Why is she so set on none of them being functional independent adults capable of living on their own? Is there some other context I'm missing here? This is just WEIRD...", "You got out. Don't get sucked back in. Give the kind of help that you gave to Ryan, helping with college applications and stay out of the rest.

It's messed up that she's placing the burden of raising your siblings on you, and trying to gaslight you into believing that you abandoned them.\n\nI understand the need for you to physically cut off your connection to that home, and that having your room be frozen in time could make you feel like a part of you is still trapped there; hence the desire to change it.\n\nThat said, you shouldn't use your brother to accomplish that goal for you. Because he still lives with your mom, he still has to play by her rules (though they are messed up). And getting him to disobey your mom's orders (i.e., redecorating your old room) could get him in a lot of trouble. Besides, if he does get into colleges, he may be moving out of the home soon anyway, and the money for redecorating may be better used for his college expenses.", "NTA from your post I get that you did not get much of a childhood.\n\nI would try to have a talk with your mother saying that being a dad should have never been a position you put your child into: even more so if you were the only bad cop.\n\nTell her that she abbandonned you.

Mom's being 100% creepy and living in fantasy land. But its not worth the drama, especially since Ryan will hopefully move out soon enough. NTA", "NTA- your mom parentified you. It\u2019s literally one of the worst things that a parent can do to a child. If you have access to therapy I can\u2019t recommend it strongly enough. Having to be a parent when you are a child fucks up your brain in myriad ways. It\u2019s really really hard to undo. Come on over to r/cptsd and/or r/raisedbynarcissists. Sorry.", ">either I'm not responsible for the kids, and I should butt out, or I am responsible and I need to own up to abandoning them\n\nThis is such bullshit. You're not responsible for them, but you can choose to help out your family when you want to. NTA", "NTA.  Abandoning them?  Wait, parents are supposed to give children roots and wings.  Roots to grow up healthy and hopefully happy and wings to go on to their next adventure.  Your mom's dream that you will live together forever and ever is unreasonable.  Ryan deserves a room that reflects his wants and needs and kudos to you for supporting that.", "You shouldn't have got involved.  It's not your business, or your problem to fix. You probably should have thrown away the boxes that said throw away.\n\nBut you're in no way the AH for your mom trying to force you to parent your siblings.", "Gentle YTA. Your mom is undoubtedly as crazy as a bag of hair, but it's not your place as a NC / LC adult child to tell a minor under your mother's responsibility what to do. He's going to turn 18 soon, at which point his legal ability to act changes drastically. That said, please communicate to your younger siblings that while your mother has some idea that everyone would stay together for all time, they are under no legal or moral obligation to do so and that you will support their choices, whatever they happen to be.", "Nta", "NTA. You mom sounds a bit nuts. In what reality is an an adult child moving out from their parent's home and having their own life considered abandoning their family?", "NTA. Your mom is a shit mom for doing what she did and she needs therapy and to be honest she needs to find a man.", "NTA, but I agree with your partner, stay out of it, help with school where you can,but don't get sucked into drama", "NTA : one if those times eyes someone gives you shit about all sorts of things, and never actually say why they\u2019re mad. \n\nI really couldn\u2019t guess why , but you\u2019ve described a challenging family situation, one where things look generally pretty good, but the reaction you described sounds a lot liked there\u2019s something more going on emotionally, not  just about cleaning out a room.", "NAH\n\nMYOB", "NTA because you told Ryan to change the room. You wasted your time trying to talk with your mother. She sounds like a narcissist.\n\nThe best thing you can do for Ryan is continue to support him and help get him into college, where he'll see there's a whole world that doesn't revolve around your mother.", "I seemed to have missed the part where you had 3 kids. Please go back to no contact with you mom and tell your brother he can contact you whenever but you are not their parents. If you can keep contact with your siblings do but you need to drop your mom NTA", "First off, your partner is wrong. For him to be anything but supportive of you after he knows your story is troubling. Second, you deserve to have a relationship with your family in a way that works for you too. Your mom made it a black and white choice as a method of manipulation and it\u2019s having the desired effect. NTA and I hope that you and your siblings are able to get closer without your awful mom being involved.", "NTA. Your mom is a controlling fruitcake. imho. Just help your brother escape her clutches by getting an education to get away from her.  Avoid engaging with you mother because she is like quicksand - she\u2019ll try to suck you back in.", "NTA. \n\nThe reason this upset you is because it is a clear reminder that your mom has delusions you will move back home, and because you love your brother and want him to be comfortable. \n\nSo you said your piece, and now you leave it alone. Your brother knows you don't care if he redecorates, your mom knows you aren't planning to come back. What they do next is up to them, and you don't need to get involved in it anymore. \n\nAnd by the way, there is a whole middle between \"being responsible for family\" and \"abandoning\" them. I call my parents almost every night and offer my opinion on a host of things. I call my sister every few days and we chat about all sorts of stuff. I can offer my opinion and advice, and sometimes even push them to do what I think is best (usually this is like going to the doctor or talking to each other about an issue they are annoyed about). That's family. By offering my advice/opinion, or even telling them when I think they are wrong, I don't become fully responsible for them. I'm sure you are working through your issues of being asked to be in charge of an entire household, but just know, you can call your mom out for shit, offer advice- and money- to your siblings, without having to move in and take over their care. \n\nMy advice is to just keep talking to your siblings, and not talk to your mom as much as you can.", "NTA- keep contact with your siblings for when they\u2019re ready to escape your mother .\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to help your siblings even if you don\u2019t live with them .

You cannot tell anyone to violate your mom's rules and decorate against her wishes. I'm shocked that you have the nerve to think you have any say in how her house is decorated. All of the rooms are hers. She just let you use one when you lived there.", "YTA", "They're still living with her. 25 has never had a job longer than six months and doesn't contribute to the house at all, and 19 is still in high school because she's developmentally disabled.", "Yeah. I was wondering how the other siblings were handling the whole situation.", "I think he's only applying to local schools and plans to do the same thing I did, which is commute from home through college so he doesn't have to pay room and board. But I had the benefit of having a room I could call my own. I'm worried about what the effects will be of living in what feels like a time capsule.", "We had a pretty big argument before I moved out where I basically said what you posted, and she turned it around by saying I was bullying her and that if that's how I wanted to view it, maybe I wasn't a \"right fit\" for the family. It's one of the reasons why we didn't talk for a while.", "THIS. OP you were parentified and I'm so sorry that happened to you.  I completely understand why you want NC/LC with mom. She may think she's a \"cool mom\" but she's very controlling and hurtful and manipulative.  I agree with partner,  help your bro and stay out of the room issue. Its not worth it. NTA at all.", "Nta the stuff you bought, you have a right to say get rid of. Same goes for your clothes. \n\nStuff you mom paid for and are part of house you have 0 say in. Paint, furniture,  bedding type of stuff. \n\nIt is a bit creepy and illustrates why you moved far away. Nice that your helping your brother out.", "OMG I choked on my coffee, I laughed so hard at 'crazy as a bag of hair' LOL", "But since it is OPs old room and her stuff, couldn\u2019t she ask for her stuff to be sent to her? Then there wouldn\u2019t be decorations and her brother could decorate how he wants.", "Sure, if it was mom\u2019s stuff. It. Is. Not. Are you the mom? Or a mom whose kids want autonomy you won\u2019t grant?", "Please, for the love of all that's holy, find another hobby.", "OMG, I'm so sorry. I was going to suggest you have an independent relationship with your other siblings as they are adults. But given the situation, I guess that's not possible. Hopefully at least with Ryan, once he's an adult, you'll be able to be in contact without mom's interference.  NTA", "If that's the case, navigating the whole room redecoration may be a bigger issue as he will be staying with your mother for longer. I do think decorating the space to fit his personal aesthetic is important for him to call it his own and feel safe and secure in the room. But I only know how you feel about the room and not how your brother feels about it. \n\nIf he does want to change it. Maybe he can start small and slow as a massive change could end in an argument. He could put up his school books and artwork and other \"essential\" trinkets on display.", "YIKES. So sorry OP. Mom is playing some fancy mind-games here making you out to be the bad guy.  Please block her for your own sanity.  Since your other siblings are adults and Ryan is almost 18,  you can have an independent relationship with them without mom being involved. NTA", "You're welcome.", "I don't think getting her stuff is what OP wants as she's made it clear that she wants them \"thrown away\". Besides, I'm pretty sure her mom would just jump at the chance to throw that back at her face i.e., \"If you want your stuff so bad, why not just come back to the house?\" or \"You're abandoning your siblings again by taking all your things\" etc.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. OP might want to ask Ryan to help her with getting her stuff out.. But honestly its not worth the drama. I guess mom will continue to life in fantasy land. NTA", "Oh, hey Mom. When did you discover reddit?", "Hahaha. That simultaneously made me laugh out loud and die a little inside."]}
