It's unfortunate that everyone thinks the ring is cursed and it's definitely a waste not being able to use it. But why risk it if you can afford to buy another one?

There's many sapphire rings out their and in my opinion, a hand me down ring for an engagement, ring or gift, is tacky and cheep. I'm not saying spend an arm and a leg for it, but a cheep- ntm a free ring says \"I don't care\" to me\n\n2. Why take the risk? You said you don't belive in superstitions which is understandable. But if it's happened with everyone, it's better to be sade than sorry. \nI personally believe that it could be cursed. It's common for old treasured items. \n\n3. It's your family's ring and you should have an say. Sure she's a part of the family too, but this is your great grandmother's ring. \n\nUltimately NTA.

Yeah. it would have happened either way, i bet other bad things happened to people who didn't wear it either. I don't believe in such things because thats only psychology behind it and people are hanging onto the wrong things. what good things happened when people wore the ring?", "NAH. I can see why your fiancee thinks you are being silly and why you don't want her to wear the ring.\n\nYou have a few options. One is to find a way around the curse to put the ring - or even just the stone - to use for your fiance. (Is the gem cursed if used by itself? Is the ring only cursed when used as an engagement ring? Is there any way to lift the curse?) Another option is to sell the ring. (I don't get why you would keep something like that, but I also don't get the idea of a cursed family heirloom.) Another option is to bury, hide, or otherwise put the ring in a safe place and move on with your life.\n\nI think I would go with that last one. It sounds like this ring should be laid to rest in your family. Have a similar (but not quite exact) ring made, and give that to your fiance.\n\nI will say... If it originally belonged to your great grandmother, that doesn't seem like many generations of cursed luck. How many ring-wearers has misfortune fallen upon?", "NTA - you many not be superstitious but you are definitely a little stitious! (Lol) and that\u2019s ok! You are under no obligation to give her a family heirloom. It doesn\u2019t belong just to you, it belongs to the family. She shouldn\u2019t pressure you once you\u2019ve said no.
