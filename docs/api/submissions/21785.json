It's unfortunate that everyone thinks the ring is cursed and it's definitely a waste not being able to use it. But why risk it if you can afford to buy another one? Just because you adore something, doesn't mean you need to have it. Don't tempt fate. It might bite you in the a**", "NTA. here's a list of reasons why\n\n1. There's many sapphire rings out their and in my opinion, a hand me down ring for an engagement, ring or gift, is tacky and cheep. I'm not saying spend an arm and a leg for it, but a cheep- ntm a free ring says \"I don't care\" to me\n\n2. Why take the risk? You said you don't belive in superstitions which is understandable. But if it's happened with everyone, it's better to be sade than sorry. \nI personally believe that it could be cursed. It's common for old treasured items. \n\n3. It's your family's ring and you should have an say. Sure she's a part of the family too, but this is your great grandmother's ring. \n\nUltimately NTA. She sounds entitled and wants to make it's sound like you owe it to her", "NTA I am super superstitious, and I think one reasonable accommodation might be to take this down and put it in a different ring if your family agrees.", "NTA, but actually, it is silly - i mean. people always interpret things the way they want. bad things happened to people who wore it? Yeah. it would have happened either way, i bet other bad things happened to people who didn't wear it either. I don't believe in such things because thats only psychology behind it and people are hanging onto the wrong things. what good things happened when people wore the ring?", "NAH. I can see why your fiancee thinks you are being silly and why you don't want her to wear the ring.\n\nYou have a few options. One is to find a way around the curse to put the ring - or even just the stone - to use for your fiance. (Is the gem cursed if used by itself? Is the ring only cursed when used as an engagement ring? Is there any way to lift the curse?) Another option is to sell the ring. (I don't get why you would keep something like that, but I also don't get the idea of a cursed family heirloom.) Another option is to bury, hide, or otherwise put the ring in a safe place and move on with your life.\n\nI think I would go with that last one. It sounds like this ring should be laid to rest in your family. Have a similar (but not quite exact) ring made, and give that to your fiance.\n\nI will say... If it originally belonged to your great grandmother, that doesn't seem like many generations of cursed luck. How many ring-wearers has misfortune fallen upon?", "NTA - you many not be superstitious but you are definitely a little stitious! (Lol) and that\u2019s ok! You are under no obligation to give her a family heirloom. It doesn\u2019t belong just to you, it belongs to the family. She shouldn\u2019t pressure you once you\u2019ve said no. Take her out and let her pick out a different ring.", "Let her know she can have the ring, but needs to take out a $5,000,000.00 life insurance policy first with you as sole beneficiary. That, or take to a jeweler and have the metal melted and remade into a new ring and have the stone recut.", "Everyone has bad things happen to them. The ring has nothing to do with it.", "Maybe NTA but very silly anyway.\n\nEveryone has misfortune in their lives. It's not caused by magic rings.", "NTA But give her the ring. Life happens. A cursed ring is nonsense.", "Don't give her the ring. There's not being superstitious and then there's just tempting fate. Get her another sapphire ring", "NTA you can just tell her that you don\u2019t want to give her something that has so much negative history. Its not only about her but about you as well. You will think about all the bad things that happened in your family every time you look at this ring.", "Is having the stones removed & put into a bracelet or necklace an option?\n\nAt the end of the day, you're NTA.  It's not her ring - she can express an opinion, but she doesn't get to dictate the use of something that doesn't belong to her.", "AH?  no...fit to be married, perhaps not.  Too many weird vibes going on here.", "Rings are not cursed.  NAH your fiancee is not one for superstition and you don't want to risk it because of your upbringing.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to wear a cursed ring nor to give one. Regardless of whether it\u2019s true or not, it\u2019s what your family believes. Honestly, it\u2019s probably better off in a safety deposit box or safe.

NTA", "NTA. Perhaps this would be a good time to sell the ring. Or have the sapphire reset into another piece of jewelery. Even if she doesn't believe in curses, your entire family thinking so will ultimately lead to problems. Anything minor will be part of the mystical curse. It's not worth it.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a very superstitious person but I have seen my friend who has a cursed home went bankrupt within 2 years of moving in. So I\u2019ll be careful about this.

I\u2019m 90% sure curses are bullshit, but those aren\u2019t good enough odds to risk it", "Yup, it is my family\u2019s ring at the end of the day, and while nobody would stop her from taking it, they wouldn\u2019t be happy about her wearing it", "Haha, that\u2019s one way to look at it.", "That\u2019s fair, I just don\u2019t see the point of risking it when I can afford a similar ring.", "That\u2019s a good idea, thank you", "Yes and no. Nobody in particular owns the family, because nobody wants to claim it, so nobody would truly protest if I gave it to her, at least not because they would\u2019ve wanted it instead.\n\nAnd nope, nothing in particular about her.", "I think that\u2019s been tried before to little avail", "The thought process behind not selling it is people don\u2019t want to pass the curse onto another family. As for it being silly, I think there\u2019s a point to be made that it seems bad things happened to at least 5 different people who wore the ring and members of the family who haven\u2019t worn it lived relatively happy lives.", "Maybe. Thanks for the suggestion.", "Not particularly, I\u2019m just aware that I could be wrong and don\u2019t see the need to risk it. And even if I did, what\u2019s wrong with believing in curses?", "Exactly.

I don\u2019t want to risk it", "Thank you, that\u2019s a good way to approach it", "Possibly but I\u2019m not sure, because I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the stone that\u2019s supposedly cursed, or the ring itself, or whatnot", "How so?", "Yeah I feel the same way. I generally don\u2019t believe in superstition but am I confident enough to roll the dice? No thanks", "I\u2019d say a) being burned alive in a house fire b) dying alongside your husband in a car accident c) being murdered by a ex lover d) finding out your husband is cheating and committing suicide and e) facing financial ruin and then having your husband and son die, all within a year of each of these people receiving the ring, is more than moderately bad", "Have the ring cleansed! Not cleaned \u2026cleansed!", "This is exactly why you shouldn't give her the ring. Even if nothing negative ever actually happened, the fear of the possibility would be hanging over your head. That would affect your mental health and potentially your physical health, as well as put a strain on your marriage. Something that she wants that is ultimately only symbolic and pretty isn't worth that.", "Mate, you absolutely believe in curses. \"I don't believe in curses but why take the chance?\" means you believe. Just be honest about that and maybe the conversation with your gf will go better.", "Do you think the curse might change if it's not an engagement ring? Maybe you guys could settle on a different ring for now. And then it could be a wedding anniversary present later on or something.", "Agreed on all counts. Why risk it?", "Don't do that either. Don't tempt fate. She will get over it.", "Always happy to break a curse and keep a beautiful ring from being wasted! This way you can use that ring money for a lovely honeymoon.

Do you see it?\n\nIt's a ridiculous thing to believe, and it leads to opportunities where other people can take advantage of you. Or, you just avoiding doing things you would otherwise enjoy.\n\nI could tell you that a certain lake is cursed and drowns its victims, and you'd avoid it when you vacationed there.

It\u2019s just reasonable doubt.", "I have no idea. I\u2019m not well versed on curses, or religion, or the history of the ring, because I know my family wasn\u2019t the first to own it.

You're *expecting* to see something bad, so that's what you see.

Throw your money in the garbage if you want, it's just as good.", "I\u2019ve heard similar things. Not that it\u2019s always bad but that it suits very very few people and for the rest it\u2019s very bad luck", "That\u2019s fair, you see it as superstition, I see it as just reasonable to avoid something that is associated with bad event after bad event", "Sure, but if they\u2019re being overlooked, it\u2019s because they\u2019re far smaller misfortunes than dying, having your husband or child dying, or facing total financial ruin.", "If it\u2019s not hurting anybody I fail to see how I\u2019m TA for it", "I think it's related to your raashi or something like that. Which, again, I don't believe in astrology, but I also have mixed feelings about its significance. So much of our religion and rituals tie into the Solar and Lunar calendars, and the entire Hindu concept of creation and time is related to cosmology and astronomical calculations.
