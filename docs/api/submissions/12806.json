You're doing exactly the right thing by not interfering in this and allowing her to experience the natural consequences of her actions. You and your husband can be sympathetic to her sadness while encouraging her to think about what changes she can make to have good relationships with her classmates.", "NTA\nYour daughter is experiencing the logical consequences of her own actions. You would be TA if you shielded her from them and signalled her that her behaviour was OK.", "NTA. Your daughter sounds like she needs help with her behavioural problems, and it sounds like you're giving it to her, which is awesome. However I wouldn't want to invite 'that problem kid' to my party (no offense!) and forcing the birthday girl to invite your daughter would be incredibly awkward for her and probably your daughter at your party. It was rude and upsetting, but there wouldn't be much good in trying to get your daughter an invitation.", "NTA - Gotta learn early that sometimes we don\u2019t get what we want. In the end, it\u2019s the kid\u2019s decision who she invites, and it would probably be really invasive to try and get your daughter into the party despite the birthday girl not wanting her there.", "What on earth is your husband on about? That's crazy. Call up the school? WTF? Let her learn her lesson here. Good teaching moment. NTA", "NTA. Does your husband get involved with the issues at school? Or is she a daddy's girl? Sounds like you're trying everything you can. Your right not to push getting her an invitation.", "NTA- It was a little rude to do it in class Im not going to lie, but I understand its easier. \n\nHonestly the girl does not owe your daughter anything, I understand why she would be upset but I also understand why the other girl would not want her there. \n\nIts very good you are getting proper help for your daughter, I wish her the best. I also was not the most well behaved child. You cannot invite yourself to another persons party.", "NTA. This is your daughter facing the social consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nThe rule is usually for younger kids so the child who is ablely different is not excluded. You daughter it sounds like has been seen by her class mates as somewhat of a bully and u fortunately a theif,no tween wants somwbodyin their house who is likely to steal from them. She is learning the hard way her actions have consenquences and this could be the kick in the a$$ she needs to turn things around.", "NTA. Even if you could somehow wrangle an invite  (which I highly doubt) no one wins when she\u2019s grudgingly invited. She won\u2019t be welcome. I think 12 is old enough to understand consequences to her actions.", "NTA Ideally, this could be a teachable moment for your daughter to understand that her behavior towards others does have consequences. \n\nIn regards to calling the school regarding the issue, I don't think that solves the problem. If she DID get an invite, it would probably be a very uncomfortable situation because the other girls didn't want her there. If the school intervenes with a rule about no longer being able to hand out gifts/invites etc. and it's traced back to your daughter (which is likely), then she becomes a target.", "NTA.  Bravo to you for understanding that there is a problem and working on getting your daughter the help she needs.\n\nThis can be an opportunity to talk to your daughter, let her know this is a consequence of her actions and things like that will continue to happen as long as she keeps up that type of behavior.", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences. Her actions have led to the consequence that she is not being included at the birthday party. Sit her down and tell her that if she continues to act the way she does, it is likely that she will continue being excluded from things with her peers. Emphasize that she alone can make the changes necessary to start being included.", "NTA for not pushing to get her invited although I\u2019d maybe look into the behavioural issues more. I\u2019d also say as someone who got pity invites a bunch I knew at the parties I wasnt wanted and felt like shit so I\u2019m never gonna be an advocate for pushing invitations on kids. Like it feels bad to be excluded but it feels worse to be excluded at the party and wishing you\u2019d taken the hint and stayed home.", "NTA for not hounding the classmate for an invitation\n\nBut you need to have your daughter assessed for those behavior issues. There might be underlying issues like ADHD or something else. If you are doing all you say and it isn't under control, that's actually quite likely. And being repeatedly rejected does not make kids more socially competent. The more they're left out and marginalized, the more they act out. It's a vicious circle with no end. It's unlikely this will be the lesson you hope.", "NTA. I agree it\u2019s rude to pass out invitations at school if you\u2019re not going to invite everyone, but nevertheless the other girl is not obligated to invite her. Your reasoning seems solid to me.", "NTA your daughter on the other hand needs to learn how to stop acting so bloody entitled to everything.", "NTA\n\nNatural consequences - you dont treat people in a nice way = they dont want to be around you\n\nThis will teach her far more than any consequences you can give her for her behaviour.\n\nValidate how she feels, cos of course it sucks for her right now, and work with her to come up with how she can act differently if she wants to be included more", "NTA\n\nThis is a perfect learning lesson for your daughter. When she misbehaves, people don't want to be around her if they have the choice not to be.\n\nYou need to get your husband on the same page.\n\nHave you two figured out why she's acting out? What is going on with you, your husband and the home situation that has her acting out so aggressively in school?", "NTA. This seems a fair consequence for her behavior. I don't like the idea of trying to force an invitation through the school (not even asking the birthday family) as though she has a right to ignore other students' discomfort with her behavior and once again impose herself on them.", "NTA. It\u2019s a great learning experience for your daughter on Cause and Effect. \nUnfortunately, the hard lessons, are the ones that stick with you, and you tend to learn the most from.\n\nSounds like you\u2019re a great mom, and I wish more parents were as practical and reasonable as you.", "NTA and your husband's attitude is the reason we're not allowed to hand out invitations at school anymore. It's beyond ridiculous. Whatever happened to having a party for your 4 best friends and that's it?\n\nI realise this makes me sound like an old bag, but parents acting all entitled to birthday invitations on their kids' behalf is beyond gross to me.", "NTA\n\nBirthday parties are a tricky introduction to social politics for children, and sometimes they can be wielded in ways that make some children feel left out.\n\nBut.\n\nIt's one kids party, and that kid decide who goes.\n\nIt would be a big ask, but if you can get your child into a position where they feel comfortable asking the party host for an explanation, and are ready to apologise if behaviour is called out, it's possible they can reach a resolution between themselves.\n\nChildren are remarkably forgiving when approached directly.\n\nIf you do go down that route, make sure to prepare your child for the fact that the invite won't be guaranteed. Let the self-learning be the goal, and don't bring up the remote possibility of an invite, let that be a potential bonus.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Parenting is hard and you are doing your level best for your daughter.", "NTA. Probably a good idea to get the therapist involved here to help explain this to her.", "NTA. you are a good mom. I hope you guys are able to work through this as a family. I know it feels too much, but it could be a learning moment.", "Yes, this can be a \u201clearning moment\u201d or whatever. Have an age appropriate discussion about this with her. Have several, ongoing, as necessary. \n\nShe may actually not have the self awareness to connect unpleasant behavior - no invites to parties. Even adults sometimes fail to connect the dots.\n\nNTA, the birthday kid doesn\u2019t want your daughter to go to her party. You didn\u2019t make a scene. Good for you.", "NTA- This is the natural consequence of her actions. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m pretty sure the invite everyone in the class rule is for elementary school when \u201ceveryone in the class\u201d is only about 30 kids. I\u2019m not sure where you are, but 12 is middle school aged in the US. That is about the age where kids start having parties that are just for their friends.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter needs to be told in no uncertain terms that her exclusion was entirely because of her bad behaviour.\n\nYour husband is enabling her with his request.", "NTA and tell husband to  butt out of this and not make the situation worse.  Explain to him what you stated here and why she doesn't deserve one.  She needs to learn now that her actions have consequences.", "NTA.

Kind of messed up to intentionally exclude one kid in the class; however 12 is old enough to understand that actions have consequences. Hopefully this is a wake up call.", "NTA. \n\nYou\u2019re doing parenting right. The other kids don\u2019t want her there because she can\u2019t act right during school, so she sure as hell won\u2019t act right during a birthday party. She could steal the presents or try to argue about who wins the party games, or how she should break open the pi\u00f1ata.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good call not demanding the parent / birthday kid give you a birthday invite out of apathy. They don\u2019t owe your daughter anything. Also who\u2019s to say if you were to ask, that they would give your daughter an invite? You could be turned down and be talked bad about amongst other parents for encouraging your daughters misbehavior. \n\nIt\u2019s a great teaching lesson that if you treat people like garbage, you don\u2019t get to be in their social circles. She\u2019s upset because nobody wants to be around her and it\u2019s a lesson she is learning right now. Hopefully this teaches her to have a better attitude towards her classmates and teachers.

First, sit down with your husband. Tell him that its natural for a parent to want to \"fix\" something that upsets their kid. Unfortunately that desire to \"fix\" often enables negative behavior and inhibits personal growth. Reddit is full of posts about how parents constantly smoothing over things for a child who has behavioral issues. They have good intentions but it results in adults who never take responsibility for themselves. Your daughter's exclusion is the result of her behavior. Forcing an invite will teach kiddo that she can act however she wants and not face consequences.\n\nNext, have a sit down with kiddo. Bring a tube of toothpaste. Have her squirt some onto the kitchen table. Instruct her to put it back in the tube. When she cant tell her this. The toothpaste represents words and actions. You cant take back stuff once its said or done. Youre left with a mess (social cobsequences). You clean up the mess by changing your behavior and rebuilding bridges with peers. Acknowledge any improvements she has made but stress that rebuilding trust and relationships takes time.", "NTA - Your daughter is now learning that actions have consequences.", "NTA ask your daughter why people who she steals from would want to hang out with her...and conversely why does she want to go to a party filled with people she doesn't like enough to treat well\n\nBut your husband needs to get with it", "NTA, she's old enough to understand that behaviors have consequences and she can't be an ass to the kids at school and expect them to hang out with her outside of school!", "NTA.
