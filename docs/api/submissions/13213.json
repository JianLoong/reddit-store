I think you're well within your rights to not participate for your own reasons or feelings on the matter.

At it's core, it's a family coming together to make sure that it's members are best enabled to maximize their comfort levels while living. I could see this being very common in family based communities. I can't say how it was presented to OP but I am sure this is reflected as a positive thing elsewhere.\n\nI think an exercise  such as this would be beneficial in all families and communities. To have the home makers get together, develop their specialty and occasionally compete (test) with each other. In theory, it should work with other family disciplines. The standard of living for many and the meaning thereof can greatly be improved. \n\nImagine if all breadwinners spent one day to get an appreciation of the effort it takes to be a homemaker. Lives would be better all round.\n\nFor OP's case; I believe that seeing as you are both breadwinners, and you are then both homemakers, you both need to go through the test. Your husband will need to put in some effort and thus you need to know what you are getting into with him. Agree to do it on that basis. \n\nThis actually sounds like a fun competition.

I don't **have** a group of male friends to share those tasks with.\n\nAll of which is to say, sure, if OP were planning to be a homemaker, the \"test\" would be a kind of fun tradition. But she's not, so they can fuck off.", "Ditch the guy. His family want to test you to see if you are qualified for him.", " Sounds like you didn\u2019t pass the test.", "LOL at Lady Skills Olympics. OP should only refer to it as this from now on. \n\nWhile also telling bf that he has FAILED the test of being a supportive partner, by thinking for one second that this is \u201ccute\u201d and not horribly demeaning. \n\nGiven they will both be working & sharing equally in the household tasks, clearly bf should take the Lady Skills Olympics test, to prove to OP that he truly understands his [half / 50% / fully equal share] of work involved in their future lives.", "I wouldn't even consider being part of this family.", "It does if said beliefs are being forced on you.", "He should take the very same test as OP and pick staying at home if he cooks and cleans better", "Good point. You should have a serious discussion with him on expectations of roles moving forward. If you have kids, will he expect you to become a SAHM? And when his family make comments about you working and not being a stay at home wife, and he just lets them have digs at you; how will you feel? Having had an in-law that made digs often towards me for this, I can tell you it does impact on your relationship with your SO when they let it keep happening.", "Genuinely curious, would you walk away from a three year relationship in this situation? You're happily with a guy, madly in love, talking about settling down and getting married, you've had no issues with him in the past, and you find out this dudes family has an uncomfortable family tradition that is rooted in misogyny but is ultimately harmless. That's your deal breaker? \"Sorry lad I know we've built this life together, but your family having this tradition is taking things too far and I can no longer see a future with you.\"  Just doesn't seem like a healthy approach to a situation like this.", "So your demeaning women for taking a test that demeans women? Kind of hypocritical, no?", "This is what I was thinking. \nNTA OP needs to have a good long think about just how sincere bf is about this considering he was raised thinking this kind of thing is normal and acceptable.", "\"This sounds like the basic plot of a lot of Indian soap dramas.\" \n\nExactly why I found it ridiculous. But no, he is not Indian", "I came to say this! He\u2019s lying about agreeing with you. He didn\u2019t warn you about his family and this \u201cfun\u201d test, and then doubled down and told you to post here to prove he\u2019s right. \nHe\u2019s telling you what you want to hear about equality, but you been given a real world honest example, please see it for the giant red flag it is!", "I'm not sure if the results mean anything. All I know is that if it's a cooking test for example, I'd have to cook a nice meal for the family and receive their approval based on how delicious it is. And trust me, they will be convinced I'm trying to take revenge on them if they ate my food. So there's that. But now that you mentioned it, his mom cooks like a 5-star chef and so do his SILs (the two whose food I've tasted). Maybe they passed the test? Idk, I'll have to ask my bf.", "If it doesn't mean anything, why does she have to do it?", "If it doesn't mean anything to him...then he should have backed OPs refusal.", "Found the boyfriend's account.", "i'm not so sure OP should be marrying someone who thinks this bullshit is all fun & games.", "Better don't get married,you will have a difficult life with their expectations.", "Not to mention build a barn and plough a field. I have a feeling this guy wouldn't excel at anything physical, the boxing match wouldn't last long if the fianc\u00e9e was his opponent.", "Learn some respect.", "Off of this alone? That's disappointingly pessimistic. I know my family has its downfalls and dramas and I'd be thankful if the only downfall my family had was a tradition that was rooted in misogyny, but was ultimately relatively harmless. If you'd turn your back on a three year relationship over something like this, you should probably work on yourself, maybe get therapy.", "Your boyfriend's family is misogynistic, even if he is Indian. The other women in the family probably have succumbed to it. And sexist people love nothing more than covering their mentality with the excuse of 'tradition'.", "Hey OP- what\u2019s your fianc\u00e9  reaction to the results of this poll? Pretty clear him and the family are the Ah and ruind their own dinner by not respecting your response\u2026", "Thats what\u2019s bothering me- has anyone \u201cfailed\u201d the test and still married into the family? \n\nIt could definitely be fun and games, but I get the vibe there would be sniggering behind peoples backs for years to come if someone fails at some stage.\n\nAnd I\u2019m curious- do men go through any tests when marrying into this family?", "Well, the question isn't whether they \"passed\" so much as \"does it matter\"?  \n\nClearly your BF chose to be with you and is seriously considering taking the next big step with you despite your lacking in the skill set or mind set his mother might prefer to see in her sons' potential wives.  His brothers clearly either looked for their wives to have these skills, or just happened to find someone who did.\n\nI'm wondering what you perceived or intuited the family's attitude to be?", "[deleted]", "boyfriend needs to grow a spine and stand up for you.", "And drink a fifth of Jack without stumbling.", "It\u2019s that for after having to go through it against their will and as a \u2018reward\u2019 get to put someone else through it. Very toxic and even if this wasn\u2019t about misogyny it would still be gross if the family poses tests to see if the new son/daughter in law was worthy to join the family", "What questions? The test is tasks.", "OP's bf himself is a red flag for thinking this is just tradition or fun. These kind of men will never understand or even try to understand their spouse. They will never ever go against their family for anything.  The fact that he thinks this ' tradition ' is fun shows that he is sexist. OP I would really consider marrying this man. These small things indicate bigger problems within the person. Be very careful with this man.", "i assumed it was just asking questions to op about how well they clean, but if it\u2019s tasks and i understood it wrong then i would change my vote", "Nope. She has to clean and cook for them to prove her competence. Miss me with that."]}
