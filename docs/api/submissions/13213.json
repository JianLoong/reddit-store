I think you're well within your rights to not participate for your own reasons or feelings on the matter.

At it's core, it's a family coming together to make sure that it's members are best enabled to maximize their comfort levels while living. I could see this being very common in family based communities. I can't say how it was presented to OP but I am sure this is reflected as a positive thing elsewhere.\n\nI think an exercise  such as this would be beneficial in all families and communities. To have the home makers get together, develop their specialty and occasionally compete (test) with each other. In theory, it should work with other family disciplines. The standard of living for many and the meaning thereof can greatly be improved. \n\nImagine if all breadwinners spent one day to get an appreciation of the effort it takes to be a homemaker. Lives would be better all round.\n\nFor OP's case; I believe that seeing as you are both breadwinners, and you are then both homemakers, you both need to go through the test. Your husband will need to put in some effort and thus you need to know what you are getting into with him. Agree to do it on that basis. \n\nThis actually sounds like a fun competition.

But that says more about the scenarios my mind comes up with if something is left unexplained than it says about ArwenCherryBlossom's uncle.", "I\u2019m also going to need to know this\u2026", "lmao you sound like an abuser. a woman says there should be a discussion about big glaring red flags and your rhetoric is \u201cassuming makes an ass of you\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "You're absolutely wrong about this one. In \"the real world\" - unless you come from a cultural background where the vast majority of women are still *expected* to become SAHM and give up their careers, you aren't going to find families that would still consider this a weird and funny little tradition. Anyone who does *not* grow up believing it is the job of the women of the family to complete all the tasks she'd be \"tested\" on here, would think this was sexist and that people who find it fun are, at the very least, not bothered by outdated views on women's roles continuing to be pushed by their family.", "Now I am an abuser? That's a massive reach. You don't know me at all. I'm not shooting discussion down, I'm disagreeing that it's worth ending the relationship over. I'm also saying that people are adding their own narrative to the story. That's not exactly a healthy or appropriate way to unbiasedly look at a scenario.", "I said this in a lengthy comment but I wanted to add that my family does not have this view. My SIL is going to be the breadwinner between her and my brother and at one of the family dinners at SILs family\u2019s place he insisted on doing all the cooking and cleaning because he could. He even wore a floral apron! But their neighbors (who visit from another country and are good friends with them) were mortified that he wouldn\u2019t be taking on the traditional role and they were genuinely concerned that he had no idea how to do things like cook and clean\u2026 they pretty much stopped talking to those people."]}
