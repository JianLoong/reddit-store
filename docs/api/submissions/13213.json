At it's core, it's a family coming together to make sure that it's members are best enabled to maximize their comfort levels while living.

I can't say how it was presented to OP but I am sure this is reflected as a positive thing elsewhere.\n\nI think an exercise  such as this would be beneficial in all families and communities. To have the home makers get together, develop their specialty and occasionally compete (test) with each other. In theory, it should work with other family disciplines. The standard of living for many and the meaning thereof can greatly be improved. \n\nImagine if all breadwinners spent one day to get an appreciation of the effort it takes to be a homemaker. Lives would be better all round.\n\nFor OP's case; I believe that seeing as you are both breadwinners, and you are then both homemakers, you both need to go through the test. Your husband will need to put in some effort and thus you need to know what you are getting into with him. Agree to do it on that basis. \n\nThis actually sounds like a fun competition.
