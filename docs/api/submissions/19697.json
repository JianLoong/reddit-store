Your pastor is very wrong for trying to blackmail you into doing something that you don't wish to do and has no real relation to actual worship.\r  \n\r  \nIf changing churches is so complicated, it sounds more like you're embedded in a cult rather than a church. That seems especially so if your kids friends can be so affected by just you changing churches.\r  \n\r  \nI'd suggest changing churches anyway and serving as a good example, but I don't know just what complications that would entail.

Is this church so popular that they don't need the fellowship of you children and yourself (including your donations)?  Let the pastor ban you and the congregation sees him for what he is.

Never get upset, never be less than calm.

This is so not Christian, or even just plain nice.  To put restrictions on who can associate with who is just plain wrong.
