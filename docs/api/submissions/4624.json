My big family and relatives usually have extravagant weddings and all of our relatives were also expecting mine to be the same.\n\nWhen I graduated, my parents sat me down and told me that they had saved around 100k each for me and my sibling (my parents have great jobs and invested a lot when they were young). They gave me the option of using that 100K however I wanted - for college, post graduation, down payment for a house, or for my wedding. Although I was a good student  in HS, I was unable to get into the school I wanted (we're not in the US), so my parents offered to pay for a different college but also told that I'd be be on my own after that. Fair enough. I used the money to graduate university, and paid for my own postgraduate studies. I have a nice job and I also bought a house recently but I am now in a debt because of it. My so and I decided to go for a small wedding to save money. My parents offered to pay for 50% of the total wedding costs. Obviously they didn't need to do that and I was overwhelmed by their generosity. I have a good relationship with my parents and intend to be there for them later in their older years to pay back for all their kindness.\n\nBecause of this, I didn't want to impose on their generosity too much and decided to keep the wedding small.\n\nNow, the problem came up when my cousin came to the reception. She (30sf) was not academically inclined. She barely graduated HS, went to community college, dropped out after failing the first semester and never went back. She also never bothered to get a job and is essentially unemployable. She met a guy and they got married a few years ago. The wedding was excessively extravagant and luxurious. Her parents paid for all of it. She's now a SAHM with a kid. \nI'm not being judgemental. People's lives are their own and her choices are hers.\n\nWhen my relatives came to my wedding, they made snide remarks on how low key it was and not 'befitting our status'. My cousin and her snobby parents also made remarks on how my parents should have paid more money for the wedding and how if only they hadn't paid so much for my college, we'd have money left for a nicer wedding.\n\nI got mad and retorted that because my parents paid for my college, I'm now in a position where i can earn my own money and if they had done the same for her, she wouldn't have been a sahm with no education, trade, income or savings of her own and completely dependent on her husband. And that her situation is her own fault (No offense to sah parents, they are wonderful and deserve all the love. It's just my cousin and realtives pissed me off with their comments).\n\nAITA for saying this?\n\nETA: we are not in the US. There are cultural differences. My family is conservative and very traditional. A 'job' here would mean something like a professional job that requires a college degree. This is why she is unemployable. She wouldn't get a job as a secretary or in a restaurant cause most of our family would look down on it. My parents on the other hand, encouraged me to get a job in college and save up for myself. They don't hold the same beliefs or outlook but others on my family side are a bit outdated.", "created_utc": 1670926328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zks8z6/aita_for_saying_that_its_my_cousins_fault_that/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure you had a small wedding but it should be more about how you\u2019re relationship is more than a venue. \nIf the opulence of a wedding is \u201cthe end all be all\u201d to what equates a successful marriage/style of life then surely; this woman would have a lot going for her. \n\nExcept that she doesn\u2019t and probably the hight of any of their relationships.\n\nThough that\u2019s only an assumption on their marriages. How does your husband feel about this going on? Have you told him or was he there to hear it?", "NTA. You simply responded to criticism in a truthful way when you burst out. Now, depending on the words, tone of voice, and so forth used, this could put you in some AH territory, but they were AH\u2019s for their original remarks. I might suggest the book Crucial Conversations in getting to this point in conversation. \n\nYou\u2019re are wiser than most and should be commended for that. Weddings, IMHO, shouldn\u2019t be extravagant. Studies have found that the more you spend on a wedding the greater your chances of getting divorced.", "NTA. You responded in kind. Was it rude, yes.

You made good use of the money that your parents gave you and have worked hard to achieve your own success. You have nothing to apologize for.\r  \n\r  \nIn terms of whether or not you are the \"asshole\" in this situation, it depends on how you delivered your response to your cousin and relatives. If you were respectful and tactful in expressing your thoughts, then you are not the \"asshole\" in this situation. However, if you were rude and disrespectful, then you may be considered the \"asshole\" in this situation.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, it's important to focus on your own happiness and well-being, and not let the judgment of others affect you.

It was very important to her, it's less important to you.\n\nSo why not just ignoring her and let her have this \"win\"? You have the better education, will earn more, have better chances in live and will probably have a better life for yourself and your kids.

She will always be a dependent. She\u2019s trapped. If she ever needs to leave her husband, she\u2019ll be off to her parents\u2019 looking for a handout and a spare room.

Y'all deserve each other.", "I agree with you- that's not elitist. That's just practical- everyone needs a means of being independent. Her relatives were being elitist, prioritizing a social event over education and skill building.", "Talking about judgement. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion though, as long as you don\u2019t pretend to live differently.\n\nI would argue that smart SAHP do exist and supportive partners do to, and some of them do actually get real money from their partner for living and retirement, do have skills that they do use after their kids are grown and live the life they pictured for themselves happily. Most of the time, the family benefits from it, wether it\u2019s financially because daycare is expensive or otherwise, by the fact the kids have someone dedicating time to them every day.\n\nAnd yes, the cons are exactly the ones you all listed, no earned money, risk of abusive situations, no retirement unless agreed on, risk of being left with nothing in case of separation etc. They exist too. But the ones who did chose to do it and it\u2019s their life. If you do look down on people over such things, you are elitist and judgemental since you do judge them and don\u2019t consider them as worthy.

There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with being a SAH parent, being 100% dependent on your SO isn\u2019t for everyone. Expensive weddings are a huge waste of money. I think you were being practical by having a small wedding and your cousin was trying to make you feel crappy about it. I think what you said in response to her rude comments was 100% justified.", "ESHwhy did you even invite them, you could have pleaded money issues and left them out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sympathise with you because I have similar thoughts about family members of my own who are irritatingly hyper critical with little acheivement of their own that they can claim. But I so far have resisted saying what is the obvious by severely limiting my contact with them.  But speaking down on someones 'poverty' or 'family' issues is too hurtful and intense a level to stoop to especially because my own principles chafe at saying them as I suspect yours do.\n\nBetter to go NC or LC\n\nETA If you cant avoid inviting them, I suggest this technique called the drift. As soon as one of them starts to speak... you just idly drift away to another person or focus your attention elsewhere completely acting as if they aren;t there.

Enjoy this next chapter.", "NTA \n\nIf she's bitter about her choices she can go back to school to get a job her family would approve of.", "I think you have done well for yourself, congratulations. Your parents support is wonderful. Weddings are about the couple. There is nothing wrong with a modest wedding. Your cousin is jealous because she didn\u2019t want to pursue an education. She is a housewife which is fine. That said , she doesn\u2019t get to open her yip and put you down. You said the truth. Your cousin can go eat crow for being a snot and trying to make your day about herself.", "Esh. They are clearly AHs, but her being a SAHM is completely irrelevant. You claim you don't care but you specifically shamed her for her being a SAHM, so you're claim that you respect SAHMs really seems like a lie. Literally all you had to do was tell them to fuck off. It's super simple.", "This story is on here at least once a week", "I just think you're incorrect. Plenty of AHs are perfectly happy.", "It's absolutely elitist. This is just rationalizing.", "I\u2019m judging the cousin\u2019s actions and choices, not her status as a human being worthy of empathy. If she were to become an abused person, I\u2019d have empathy yet I wouldn\u2019t be shocked.", "The fact that your judging her decision to be a SAHM just makes you are incorrect as OP. Your empathy is irrelevant.", "No, the period of time she\u2019ll be home with young children is just a small portion of life. The cousin has decided (per OP, so admittedly we don\u2019t have a firsthand account) to be unemployed for life and entirely dependent on her husband. It would be wonderful and an ideal outcome for the husband to be loving, fit and healthy, able to work and support her for life. That would be great for OP, if you can find a man willing to do that, great. But she has no backup plan. If he has a car accident or other eventuality that ends his ability to provide, she\u2019ll be up shit creek without a paddle. She surrendered her paddle long ago. Nay, she never brought it on the voyage to begin with. Is staying at home to raise young children a valid life choice, beyond the purview of public judgment? Perhaps. But staying at home for life as a dependent, never ever working? That\u2019s a gamble, and I judge this cousin the same way I judge all career-gamblers."]}
