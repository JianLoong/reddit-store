I asked if she liked her doing it and she said she did, but not when daddy made her hair because she liked his more. So next time I dropped my daughter I talked to the teacher and asked her to stop doing her hair regardless of what she thought looked weird or nice, she got red in the face and apologized a few times, I kept telling it it was no big deal, but to respect my daughter's opinion and left. \n\nYesterday while having dinner, my daughter mentioned the incident and my mom got mad at me, for context, my mom was also a kindergarten teacher and said that what I did was not okay and that I humiliate someone who was trying to help my daughter because she has seen how my husband does my daughter's hair, and that I should apologize when my daughter goes back to school.

Let me fix it.\" I would have told the teacher to keep her mitts off as well.", "NTA\n\nIf your daughter asked the teacher to fix it, thats one thing. Teachers generally dont go fixing hair.\n\nNow you discussed it with the teacher one on one and thats perfect. Teacher apologised and wont do it anymore which is the outcome you wanted.\n\nI don't follow where your mum is coming from.", "NTA -", "NTA", "NTA, it is not the teachers job to humiliate a child on how the parent does their hair.", "NTA and your Mom is wrong. You didn\u2019t set out to humiliate the teacher but every time the teacher redid your daughters hair was her reinforcing that your daughter\u2019s appearance is how she will be judged by others! It also eroded your daughters choice and preference. She loves her dad doing her hair and THAT is more important than a judgey teacher and her idea of what you daughters hair should look like. \n\n(Man! I\u2019m angry at the teacher! Can you tell?)", "NTA, your mom can step off.  She is implying that the teacher has more authority over your child than you-- and also belittling the fact that your daughter has a right to boundaries.\n\nThe teacher would not have been embarrassed and then apologized both to you and to your daughter (props for that!) if she hadn't understood, at least at that point, that she had overstepped.", "Adults need to start respecting when children lay out their boundaries. Good for you, Mama! Absolutely, NTA! That teacher, even if she is a great teacher, needs to be reminded that regardless of their age, children have thoughts and feelings that have to be respected. Most of the time, people just blow off the feelings of kids because they are kids. This makes them feel as though their feelings aren't valid. This is wrong and damaging.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter likes how her dad do her hair, be that crooked or not. While the teacher may ask a child under her care if the child wants her hair redoed, she should respect the child's decision. \"Helping\" someone when no help is needed is annoying and disrespectful.\n\nYou just asked the teacher to stop redoing it without your daughter's (or her parent's) permission. She just had to respect your daughter's \"no thanks\". It is not humiliating. You didn't make a scene, loudly talking so the other parents would overhear, you didn't ask for a meeting with the teacher and her superior nor sent her an e-mail and cc'ed all her superiors up to the director and district supervisors about the matter. You were reasonable.", "NTA your teacher touched your daughter's head explicitly against her consent. OH, I would be throwing an absolute FIT to the principal and the superintendent if necessary. This is a situation where it's absolutely acceptable to escalate it up the lines. A teacher, for heaven's sake, should understand consent.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter said no. She disrespected that boundary.", "Ynta your daughter didn't like it but the teacher kept doing it", "NTA and you were way calmer than I would have been.  I would have lost my shit at the thought of someone touching my child's hair.  Your job is to teach.  Do that.", "Like the teacher isn't humiliating your daughter saying her hair looks weird and redoing it?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like she's still salty after getting in, valid, trouble for doing similar.", "NTA", "NTA but the teacher was, i\u2019m glad talking to her fixed it. she kinda deserved to be a little embarrassed.", "NTA it doesn\u2019t matter that it was hair this time. It\u2019s about your daughter\u2019s bodily autonomy and the right to say No and have it respected by Everyone.", "*NTA keep your and your daughters boundaries. She told her no. That\u2019s that", "NTA that teacher was WAY out of bounds when your daughter said no and it wasn't respected. That's why the teacher was embarrassed. Teaching children that when they say \"no\" to something happening to their body is important and that teacher should be reported.", "CONSENT! she asked, kid said No. She should NEVER ever just carry on regardless. End of story. NTA.", "NTA. This crossed a line, that the teacher should not have crossed. You were right to ask the teacher to stop. But she apologized at least, so that should be that, provided she doesn't do it again of course.", "NTA - I work with children and the only time I touch a child\u2019s hair is if they ask me to. \n\nI\u2019m sure the teacher meant well, but she needs to be respectful of your child\u2019s boundaries.", "Definitely NTA! It\u2019s such a special thing for your daughter to have her father do her hair. This honestly melted my heart. \nTouching another child\u2019s hair isn\u2019t exactly respectful - fair enough if her hair came out and was in her face or something, but doing it just because she thought it was messy is wrong\u2026", "NTA. In the slightest. Teacher is overstepping big time.", "Teacher here- you\u2019re NTA. \n\nFixing something that got messed up during play is one thing- and even then, only if the child asks. \u201cFixing\u201d something just because it doesn\u2019t fit what you think looks nice? Even when the child has expressed \u201cNO\u201d to the \u201chelp\u201d? BIG red flag. \n\nYou are not the a*hole here, at all. If that teacher was so concerned, she could have called home or sent a note asking why the girl was going to school with different hairstyles on different days, though even that would be a bit odd, but hey, maybe mom\u2019s a day drinker and she\u2019s right to be worried. But just \u201cfixing it herself\u201d does not say \u201cconcerned teacher\u201d it says \u201cteacher overly worried about how my students look so I look like a great teacher.\u201d \n\nIf you can, grab a notebook and note down the dates that your daughter came home with \u201cfixed\u201d hairstyles, the date that you spoke to your daughter and what she told you, and the date and time (approx) that you talked to the teacher. Then  try to note down the days that your husband does her hair, and see if the teacher keeps \u201cfixing it\u201d despite your talk. If she continues, take your notes and concerns to an administrator. By that point, both the student AND her mother would have told the teacher to stop, and she still hasn\u2019t. I hope this isn\u2019t needed, but thought I\u2019d add it just in case.", "Easy fix, because even you classified her hair as looking \"better\" when you assumed your husband had improved: take the ONE EVENING and make sure husband knows how to make daughter's hair presentable! NTA, but teacher thought it looked bad and thought she was helping.", "NTA", "NTA - everything else aside - we have to teach children as early as possible that no means no..That no one has a right to do anything to their body, especially when they've said no.\n\nTelling a child, especially at such a young age, that they look weird is an awful thing to do. I totally get wanting to support the kids you teach, and wanting to make sure they're being cared for; but that's not what this was. \n\nI think the way you handled it all was perfect, you assured the teacher it wasn't a big deal so as to avoid further embarrassment. You supported your child in setting their own boundaries.", "NTA", "Have taught for nearly 30 years, mostly in grade 1 and I agree. Part of our job is teaching healthy boundaries/consent and that needs to be done by example. If a student asks, I will help but this teacher way overstepped especially once the daughter said no. The teacher would probably get mad if the child said something on her looked weird so why would it be okay the other way around?", "Yeah, I teach 3-5th grade musical theater.\n\nI don't touch their hair. Ever. They move it off their necks to place mics and they do each other's hair after that.", "And against the daughter's express wishes, triple no!", "I would agree in saying her intentions were good, but not taking no from the daighter and calling the daighters hair \"weird\" throws me off", "Yeah teacher actually seems pretty chill. She might have overstepped a bit with the hair, but it seems like she responded well to the complaint and will hopefully be a bit more conscientious in the future. It seems like her intentions were always good at least. \n\nThe mom is really the only one complaining, and it seems like she has the least amount of information so yeah I agree she should chill.", "You\u2019re so right, spot-on comment", "The teacher was not respecting the daughter\u2019s wishes to not have her hair done even though the daughter told her no thanks. Teacher is def an AH\n\nEdit- spelling", "Why would a 5 year old lie about her teacher doing her hair when she doesn\u2019t want to", "She is humiliating your daughter by redoing her hair.  Most of all is the red flag of her not respecting your daughter saying no to this. Redoing her hair is unwanted physical contact.  She is teaching your daughter that her not wanting to be touched by an adult does not matter.", "I agree, and the teachers actions were wrong, your daughter may only be 5, but she has every right to decide what she wants her hair to look like. I think that it's adorable that your husband does her hair, and honestly he's just showing his love...besides every little girls hair looks messy at the end of the day, especially at 5 years old.", "First off, definitely NTA. But I wanted to add that I think it's a good sign that her teacher didn't just apologize to you, but also to your daughter. \n\nI'm an educator as well and while I'd be embarrassed if a parent had to have this conversation with me, it would be because I realized I had overstepped a boundary. It happened, you addressed it in kind way and it sounds like the teacher took it to heart and probably learned a long term lesson.", "It should be fine. I don\u2019t think that teacher was offended or humiliated.\n\nYou mom was a teacher from a different generation.", "Except the daughter said no so it\u2019s not like your situation where the students are asking for a different style the teacher asked the daughter, the daughter said no, and then the teacher did it anyway", "true", "This is the real issue for me. The teacher imposed onto a kid without bringing it up to her parents, but I could waive that off as good intention and poor forethought. But she did so *despite this kid saying no.* At that point, the teacher needed to bring her concerns up to the parents - if the messy hair is somehow distracting or is causing ridicule from other kids or something, there's room for that conversation. But teaching a young girl that she isn't allowed to say no to a non-parent adult touching her is *so* concerning.", "Yeah, this teacher seems fine. Clueless but ready to learn. Someone higher up called her actions a \"massive red flag\" but that's overstating it given how she responded to OP. Sometimes it's just cluelessness & that changes with instruction and experience.", ">you addressed it in kind way\n\nThose words \"you addressed it in kind way\" would be the solution to so many problems we see here.", "Humiliation is having the teacher redo your hair.", "I'm not a teacher but I'm a youth worker. Often go on weekends away with the work kids. At 16 when I left school I trained to be a hairdresser so braids are extremely easy for me. I once asked a younger child with long thick hair did she want braids, she opted to leave her hair down. I asked was she sure as it'll be a busy day, she said she's sure. The next day I helped her brush out the knots from the previous day after she washed it because she asked. Then I asked 'one braid or two' and she went to say it's ok before catching my eye and she agreed to two. The next residential she was straight in having me braid her hair and encouraging the young ones who were on their first time away to let me braid their hair. I'll admit it was hard to let her say no and it was harder not to say 'i told you so' whilst I brushed out the knots but she needed to be respected and she needed to feel able to come to me for help when needed - it wasn't about me."]}
