I asked if she liked her doing it and she said she did, but not when daddy made her hair because she liked his more. So next time I dropped my daughter I talked to the teacher and asked her to stop doing her hair regardless of what she thought looked weird or nice, she got red in the face and apologized a few times, I kept telling it it was no big deal, but to respect my daughter's opinion and left. \n\nYesterday while having dinner, my daughter mentioned the incident and my mom got mad at me, for context, my mom was also a kindergarten teacher and said that what I did was not okay and that I humiliate someone who was trying to help my daughter because she has seen how my husband does my daughter's hair, and that I should apologize when my daughter goes back to school.

Please hear me out: \n\nThe teacher really thought she was doing the right thing. Your daughter is 5, and perhaps the teacher thought she was too embarrassed to say yes. She did say that she liked it on days when the teacher took time to make her look nice but not when daddy did the hair that day, but she said that to YOU. \n\nI think you are probably raising a lovely child who is sensitive to the feelings of others. She likes how teacher does her hair, but is so sweet in wanting to keep daddy\u2019s efforts, despite how messy they might be. You highlight certain lexicon seemingly provided to outline with evidence how you daughter was disrespected by her teacher. Hmmmm, let\u2019s see\u2026.\n\nThe lack of context regarding use of the word \u201cweird\u201d, and the phrase \u201cno thanks\u201d:\n\n\u201cGood morning darling, would you like me to do your hair again today? You have such nice hair, just this part is a bit weird, would you like me to fix it?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo thanks\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok sweetie, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll do it like I did all the times before when you liked it\u201d \nDaughter quietly sits, and does NOT say, \u201cNo thanks because my daddy did it today!\u201d\n\n\n*This is vastly different from \n\u201cyour hair looks weird, let me fix it\u201d \n\u201cno thanks\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m fixing it anyway\u201d*\n\nNow the teacher might be thinking that your daughter had tried to do it herself, (knowing she been appreciative of when teacher has fixed her hair in the past), and is saying no thanks because she is embarrassed of her attempt, and doesn\u2019t want to ask for help. \n\nI\u2019m not necessarily calling you an AH, but neither is she. It was a freaking *misunderstanding* How we know: \n\nWhen you talked to the teacher:\n\n\u201cshe got red in the face and apologize a few times\u201d - Oh my she was very embarrassed at trying to do something nice that backfired, she was obviously sorry. \n\nYou \u201cweren\u2019t rude or anything\u201d, \u201cI said it was no big deal, *but respect my daughter\u2019s opinion*\u201d \n\nHoly cow, this was not about her having disrespecting your daughter or her opinions. \n\nWhat I would have said:  \n\n*\u201dHi teacher, I just wanted to *thank you* for being so kind with my daughter, I know she likes it sometimes when you fix her hair. With all the flack coming at overworked and underpaid teachers these days, I feel so *grateful* to have such a caring person who finds the time to give individual attention to the students. I just want to let you know, that on the days when it looks especially in need of fixing, and she declines your help, it is because her daddy did her hair that morning, she is proud of his efforts and doesn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings by changing it. It\u2019s no big deal, I just want to let you know what\u2019s behind the \u2018no thanks\u2019. I\u2019m also teaching her age appropriate lessons on body autonomy right now, so I\u2019m hoping going forward we can support her in any situation where she says \u2018no thanks\u2019. I know this was just a misunderstanding, and again I\u2019m so glad she has a teacher who cares\u201d*\n\nSo, you handed the situation, albeit with probably an attitude and a command, \u201c respect my daughter\u2019s opinion\u201d \u2026..teacher apologized profusely to you and \u201cyour baby\u201d. The same teacher who has made your daughter happy with styling MULTIPLE TIMES, with ZERO complaints, and ZERO thank yous from you. I truly hope you are simultaneously teaching your daughter about misunderstandings, as well as respect and gratitude for well meaning teachers and other humans. \n\nWhy do I think you had an attitude? Your mother\u2019s reaction. Your mom knows you very very well. I think this probably post minimizes how you approached the teacher. But YOUR MAMA? I would bet the farm that SHE knows *exactly* how you marched in and with a bit of attitude *confronted*, (not had a discussion with), this teacher, then talked to your baby about how the teacher was disrespecting her. \n\nNow here you are, problem solved still coming for validation. I think you are here because you actually know you were over the top, you know you never thanked the teacher for the individualized attention given to your child. Also, your mother knows you demonstrated attitude not gratitude and that\u2019s why called you out. SHE WAS A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER, AND SHE RECOGNIZES WHAT KIND OF PARENT YOU WERE BEING LIKE!! \n\nI agree with your mother. I absolutely think you should apologize to the teacher who was contrite and mortified, for your DELIVERY! Then teach your daughter about misunderstandings, gratitude and respect for teachers who care. (A red faced, mortified, profusely apologetic K teacher most definitely went home and cried. I had many many of those days too, before I quit to teach parent free college students.) \n\nNAH because you want to protect your daughter, but the teacher isn\u2019t an AH either because her heart is in the right place. \nAlthough I have a feeling that without a bit of self reflection, many more teachers in the future are going to experience you  commanding them to \u201crespect your baby\u201d. \n\n*Life pro tip: Be kind to the folks with whom you entrust your children. If you find yourself marching into a classrooms, try to make at least some of those times because you are asking how you can support the teachers and students\u2026You don\u2019t want any teacher to even subconsciously have an aversion to your child because you are a lot*", "Good.

The Daughter-Mom-Teacher interaction seemed really positive to me. Daughter spoke up about her feelings, Mother helped back her up in what sounds like a respectful and constructive way, and the teacher apologized and listened!

That is way, way, not okay!", "Also how is she supervising a whole class if she has time to do hair?", "Also, your daughter said \"no thank you,\" which means this teacher did not have *her* permission to redo *her* hair.

That teacher is  teaching that child that NO DOESNT MEAN NO. Yes its only hair now, but down the track this could lead to other worse scenarios.\n\nETA, NTA OP and maybe you should explain to your mum that if she is willing to dismiss her granddaughters boundaries then maybe she should be dismissed as grandmother. Boundaries are important they are what keeps us safe. Continue teaching your daughter her boundaries matter. It's easier to start small at young ages (like a kindergartners hair) so that when they are older, they will have the confidence to say no to more serious boundary crossing.", "[removed]", "Different generation, different times.", "Imagine how the girl would have felt if she was the one who had done her own hair and was so proud of it.", "/u/Kooky_Hucklebe is a bot that stole part of this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gqr5q/aita_for_asking_my_daughters_teacher_to_stop/jflwloz/", "We adopted (perm guardianship for those that understand the importance) older kids.
