Both my husband and I work, sometimes he leaves before I do, sometimes I leave first, and when this happens he's in charge of doing her hair and dropping her at school. My husband is no master of doing hair and most of the time her pigtails or braids are crooked, but my baby loves her father and him doing it is one of her favorite things in the world.  \n\nThese past few times I noticed that my daughter's hair was well done despite knowing it was my husband who did it, so one time while driving home I complimented it and told my daughter how ''daddy was getting better'', but she got sulky and made a face, I asked what was wrong and she said her teacher had been re-doing her hair because it looked ''weird'' and even when she said ''no thanks'' a few times she still did it. I asked if she liked her doing it and she said she did, but not when daddy made her hair because she liked his more. So next time I dropped my daughter I talked to the teacher and asked her to stop doing her hair regardless of what she thought looked weird or nice, she got red in the face and apologized a few times, I kept telling it it was no big deal, but to respect my daughter's opinion and left. \n\nYesterday while having dinner, my daughter mentioned the incident and my mom got mad at me, for context, my mom was also a kindergarten teacher and said that what I did was not okay and that I humiliate someone who was trying to help my daughter because she has seen how my husband does my daughter's hair, and that I should apologize when my daughter goes back to school. So, I don't know. I wasn't rude or anything.", "created_utc": 1681063625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gqr5q/aita_for_asking_my_daughters_teacher_to_stop/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I put barrettes back in and if a ponytail completely falls out I will help fix it, but to completely take down a hairdo and redo it because the teacher doesn't like it -  no. And to actually tell your daughter that she thinks it looks weird, double no. The teacher might have good intentions but it's still not something that she needs to take upon herself to do, especially after your daughter asked her not to.", "NTA. Your child has the right to determine who touches her, regardless of how \u201cnice\u201d their intentions were. Your daughter asked her to stop. The teacher should have stopped.", "NTA. As a parent with the same age child, it's a real balancing act with the teachers. It might have been better to explain to the teacher why you were bringing it up with the good parts ( daughter likes it sometimes) and bad parts (but not when Daddy does it). The teacher would empathize with all the data.", "NTA. Your mom needs to chill. You didn\u2019t get angry with the teacher unless you are rewriting the story. If a teacher can\u2019t handle a simple complaint that addresses touching another persons child and their personal space they should probably consider a different profession", "NTA - but the teacher is only a mild one. She probably did what she did from a place of kindness, nonetheless it\u2019s wrong and rude. She should firstly respect your child\u2019s protests and secondly respect the work someone put into fixing her hair.", "NTA. Honestly doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s AH in this situation besides your mom for trying to make you feel bad for doing what your daughter asked. The teacher was trying to help, realized they overstepped and seemed to be genuine in apologizing. If your daughter prefers her dads way, who is Grandma to override that?", "NTA. Mostly your mom is for her attitude and guilt trip. The teacher, mildly so. She needs to remember to listen to her students and their boundaries about their body.", "NTA.  The teacher is overstepping.  If you were polite but firm, then all is good.  If she continues to do it after you\u2019ve asked, then time to turn up the heat.", "NTA , You rightly enforced your and your daughter's boundaries after she'd overstepped them repeatedly. Nothing wrong with that.", "If your daughter was asking her to do it, that would be one thing. But because she says she likes it when Daddy does it, the teacher should respect your daughter's wishes. NTA", "NTA - you weren't rude about it.", "NTA.\n\nTeachers are meant to be teaching not hairdressing. Especially if the kid said no to changing her hair style. The teacher was most likely trying to help, but your daughter said no to her redoing her hair and she did it anyways.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter's saying \"No, thank you \" should have been good enough to put a stop to it.  You didn't \"humiliate\" anyone,  you cleared up a concern for your daughter. \n\nThis goes WAY beyond hair and her love of her daddy.\n\nIt's a terrible idea to teach children that they can't say no to someone touching them in a way they don't want.  Especially an adult in a position of authority and trust.  I hope you will follow up with your daughter and make sure she knows that if someone,  anyone,  touching her when she doesn't want them to,  she should tell you or daddy . Teach her that her body,  from her hair to her toenails,  is hers . Talk about good touch,  bad touch , and \"not fun but important\" touch (like getting shots at the doctor or getting an owie cleaned up).", "NTA. Teachers are there to teach not to do hairdressing. I wouldn\u2019t be mean about it though because she probably thinks it\u2019s a nice thing to help with", "NTA. Your mom is wrong. You had a problem and handled it properly and with the teacher. Your teacher acknowledged it and agreed to fix it.", "Info: does your mom frequently examine your interactions looking for fault and invalidating you?

Her teacher also insulted her by saying her hair looked \u201cweird.\u201d Stepping in and requesting that the teacher stop overstepping her bounds is *well* within your rights as a parent.\n\nThe fact that your mom is more upset about you confronting the teacher than she is about the teacher ignoring her granddaughter\u2019s boundaries is gross.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't humiliate the teacher, she had probably and quite reasonably assumed she was being helpful but you explained that this wasn't the case and asked her not to do so anymore.\n\nThat's it. No drama, no anger, just a polite request and explaination. \n\nYour mum is not doubt remembering some far more humiliating or aggressive crap from her own experiences and conflating them with the situation here. That's not okay.", "NTA. Your daughter's teacher needs to learn boundaries and should be embarrassed for redoing your daughter's hair even after your daughter said \"no thanks\".", "You were polite and calmly asked the teacher not to do your daughter's hair anymore, and even told her it was no big deal.  \n\nI can see why the teacher would feel humiliated, but that's on her, it's her feeling, it's not caused by anything you did. You didn't make her get up in front of the school and yell \"Shame! Shame!\" at her.  You were calm and polite, and made a reasonable request, so you're NTA.", "You told that teacher to respect when your daughter tells her no, I think it's the most important here especially regarding someone touching her against her will. Besides, it's not like you screamed at her in front of everyone.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \"humiliate\"? How? If you were polite I don't see a problem.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t make a scene just made a simple request to respect your daughter\u2019s wishes. Not at all out of line and the teacher understood. You handled it perfectly. Don\u2019t dwell on it.", "NTA. Period. That teacher has no right to do that.", "INFO What did the teacher mean by \u201cweird hair\u201d? What constitutes weird hair for a kindergartener? OP, you\u2019re NTA, but now I\u2019m curious.", "NTA, first off it's a bit inappropriate for a teacher to be touching a child in any form especially if it's unwanted. You made a simple request for her to not redo your daughter's hair, she should respect that. You do not need to apologize, she needs to respect your wishes and apologize for continuing to redo your daughter's hair.", "NTA. The teacher shouldn't be doing your daughter's hair unless it is a safety concern or if your daughter asks her to do so. If your daughter asks her to do so, then assuming the teacher can safely do so and not ignore other children, sure.", "NTA. I want to believe the teacher had the best intentions, but she was overstepping, and it doesn't sound like you made a scene? It was likely very embarrassing for her, but should hopefully be something you guys can move past.", "NTA.\n\nThe teacher crossed a major boundary and should be disciplined. She knew what she was doing was wrong because she was embarrassed when she learned that you knew about it. Your daughter asked the teacher not to mess with her hair and the teacher did it anyway.\n\nYour mom should back off. Her decades-old \"advice\" is worthless. What will she suggest next, caning your daughter if she misbehaves?\n\nAnd really, why does anyone even care if your daughter's hair is slightly imperfect for kindergarten? Don't these people have anything better going on in their lives?", "NTA. You didn't call out the teacher publicly.", "I\u2019m a teacher and you\u2019re NTA, especially with your description of how you approached it.

Don't give it a second thought.", "Did the teacher actually confirm that your daughter asked her not to touch her hair? Sounds weird that she would just do her hair even if she was asked not to.

Thats the end of it. Not the teachers job, repsponsibility, or right. There is no safety issue involved with the hair so a child's consent needs to be respected. That teacher needs a cuff upside the head, and so does your mother. \n\nChildren need to learn that their cobsebt matters. Even if it gets  bit gray (because we still need to help correct their behavior to be safe) body consent matters a ton.", "NTA - this teacher is way too concerned about looks and that can be very harmful.  She is the type that can help cause body dysmorphia, eating disorders as kids get older.  Looks don't matter.  If the child's hair if filthy on a regular basis, that is an issue, but who cares if her part is crooked or is \"weird\".  \n\nThis is a big deal.  She is teaching a 5 year old that weird is bad, that she has to be perfect or it isn't acceptable and that she has to allow other people to do things to her body - she should be teaching CONSENT, not violated it.  I would actually take this one step further and ask to meet with the teacher and the supervisor to discuss her finding fault with the appearance of her students (AND ACTING ON IT) and body autonomy issues.  THIS IS IMPORTANT, you should not be embarrassed by it, you need to stick up for your daughter.", "NTA. But this is such a strange story.

I know people who would have gone up there shrieking and name calling the teacher. You just politely stood up for your child as you should. Honestly maybe she learned something to help her in the future bc if she keeps redoing kids hair (or similar) without parent\u2019s permission after the kid says no, some unhinged parent is gonna go scream at her. You were polite and the teacher stopped. Yr mom is wrong.", "I also thought it was rude and condescending to tell her it looked weird, but I'm not really a confrontational person so I just went straight to the point, either way, I don't think any adult should tell to any kid that their hair looks weird because they don't like it", "Exactly! NTA. This teacher needs to learn that children are people and they own their bodies.", "Oh I did, I just didn't add it to the post, I explained that the crooked hairstyles are mostly done by my husband but my daughter really likes it so it should be okay, I also explained my conversation with my baby and the teacher also apologized to my daughter, she hasn't touch her hair ever since.", "Sounds like the teacher was embarrassed but didn't make an issue so I'm sure ultimately understood.

And I wonder how many kids had their self esteemed demolished by your mom since\n>my mom was also a kindergarten teacher and said that what I did was not okay and that I humiliate someone who was trying to help my daughter\n\nApparently your mom believes its OK for the teacher to humiliate kids by calling their hair weird and forcing them to be restyled.

You had an honest conversation with your child's teacher, with a request to listen to her student. Sure, the teacher seemed embarrassed, but that's not the same thing as humiliation. Sounds like the both of you handled this well.", "OP's daughter told her that she didn't want it though.", "You know, that's a valid point. She did say no to the teacher didn't she. That's an uncool move by the teacher.", "This was what I thought.
