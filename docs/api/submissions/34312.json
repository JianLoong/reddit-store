It results in an argument where I have to bend or everyone is mad at me.\n\nI also make a lot more then my friends so it always result in them basically calling me cheap. They don\u2019t get I want to pay for my meal and that is it. \n\nAnyways we went out to eat yesterday and they all ordered things that were around 30 dollars, I got the house salad and my total was around 12. They told the server to split the bill and I didn\u2019t want to fight about it again.\n\nI asked the server to add on to the bill an entree and dessert for me to take home. This resulted in my bill going up into the 30s.\n\nSo they asks me what I was doing, I told them I am getting more food, they got upset they I increased the price they needed to pay. This resulted in another argument and they think I am a jerk.\n\nEdit: Reddit I\u2019ve done everything you have suggested, I have had the server take mine out and I pay for it, I have spoken to them.

Problem solved.", "Info: Why don\u2019t you just say upon ordering, mine will be on a separate ticket?", "NTA. 100% NTA. I feel this in my bones.\n\nI was on vacation with some extended family and we went out for most of our meals alongside some of their friends who I did *not* know. \nMost of them 30+ years my senior and highly successful in their fields of work. I\u2019m talking owns-a-beach-house wealthy. \nThey\u2019d basically play dumb. \u201cOhhhh idk, what\u2019s the total come to? $300 for 6 of us? Let\u2019s just pay $50 each it\u2019s too hard to calculate it.\u201d Meanwhile they\u2019ve ordered several bottles of wine and had at least two dishes each, whilst I\u2019ve had one simple dish and 1-2 non alcoholic beverages at most. Sometimes just water.\n\nI had to insist that it\u2019s very simple math but if it\u2019s too much trouble I\u2019m more than happy to calculate everyone\u2019s individual totals for them to save them the \u201cburden\u201d they explained was their reasoning.\n\nMy total would end up being $20 + a generous 20-30% tip and theirs would all be $55~ give or take. (I always ensured my tip was not factored into their math cos they\u2019d try that too) \n\nThe gaslighting is real when you\u2019re told that \u201cfussing over $30 is so silly\u201d but their bills only went up by $3-10 each when required to pay for *what they actually ordered* \ud83d\udc80\nI just hit them with if $30 is nothing, $3 is *dust* is it not? And they accepted it after that particular meal. \n\nA two week vacation dining out twice a day and overpaying by $30 per meal is over $800 of stolen money. No thanks.\n\nTLDR: question their reasoning and *crush it.*", "NTA but when you first arrive it would be helpful for you to tell the staff that you are on your own check. If they prefer to split the bill, they can, but you don\u2019t HAVE to. \n\n\nAlso your friends kinda suck. FYI lol\n\nETA changed bull to bill. Nightshift has made my brain mush", "NTA\n\nWhilst adding on extra take-out food in order to get \u201cbetter value\u201d out of the split bill is kind of an unusual move one your part, in context it makes sense.  Your friends should have respected your decision to pay separately for your own food in the first place - people have their own preferences as to how they handle money on nights out with friends and your preference for just paying for yourself is perfectly reasonable.  \n\nIt\u2019s also lame of them to call you cheap for doing things your own way when you happen to make more money - regardless of income levels, your money is your own to spend how you see fit and if you want to keep yours for savings, personal projects, family stuff or whatever, instead of on steak and cocktails for your buddies, then that\u2019s entirely your call.  \n\nIdk if it\u2019s just that you and your friends have a different outlook, or if they\u2019re actively trying to sponge off you, but either way you\u2019ve made it very clear that you like to do things a certain way and they should just accept that.", "I agree with those saying you need new friends. \n\nIf you want to keep going out to dinner with this bunch, then order a similar amount and just take whatever you don't eat home with you.

The only time it\u2019s reasonable is if stuff is family style\u2014but a lot of times those places charge per person anyway. I think you were perfectly reasonable, it doesn\u2019t sound petty, it sounds like you wanted to get what you paid for and they all ordered $30 worth of food and if they aren\u2019t comfortable paying $30 for food then they shouldn\u2019t be ordering that much and relying on you ordering less to bring down their bill total by pawning some of it off on you.\n\nIn the future if asked out by these friends I would say \u201cI will come if I pay for my own food and only my own food, otherwise we can hang out another time for another activity!\u201d", "NTA \nForcing the group to split the check evenly is always an asshole move: you should never go through with it unless everyone is on board.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you make more than your friends, this situation should't be happening to begin with.\n\nSounds like they were mad they finally had to pay for what they ordered.", "INFO- Why are you going out to eat with them?", "NTA, you just made your price even with them.\n\nAlso I did the math. If everyone was 30 bucks and yours was 12. You would pay 25 dollars an extra 13 dollars.\n\nIf everyone is around 30 now you are paying about 30 each. Thats fair, they get mad if you pay separately. They just want free money form you\n\nEdit: I\u2019m correct, 4 people in total. Also we were given the numbers, the average is a linear line. More people more money op loses.", "NTA. They want to split the bill, while you ordered the cheapest option. So it is fair that you order more - to get the price even per person, so you don't have to pay extra. Splitting the bill when not everyone is on board is just a bad idea. \n\nYou should talk to your friends (outside of a restaurant) about this situation. That you don't like the system. But if the insist on doing it, you will add food to go for yourself so your check would be the same as the average portion per person. Or if they don't like it, you would be happy to pay for your stuff and they could still splitt the bill after", "Just order a larger meal and take the \"leftovers\" home instead of ordering as take out.  Or, let them be pissed and pay your own bill.

Never again.", "Next time order 5 bottles of wine for yourself, surf and turf, shrimp appetizer and 3 desserts. The only people that want to evenly split checks are the people trying to take advantage of someone.

One mineral water with lime juice was always considered 'equal' to three bottles of \u00a350 a bottle wine, and I'm still expected to pay the same as them. The last time they ordered brandys with their coffee -  I had had enough and asked the server for separate checks. They griped a bit but had to agree it was totally unfair. They still invite me though and now it's always separate checks. No more being walked all over.", "NTA. That was a great move. Also, get new friends.", "Why are you friends with these people", "NTA but I think you need new friends. I often eat out with friends and split the bill but if someone doesn\u2019t get starters or doesn\u2019t have drinks we\u2019ll make sure they pay separate so only people with similar totals are splitting the bill. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter that you make more than them. They shouldn\u2019t be using you to subsidise their bill.", "I\u2019m going to go with NTA - you gave them a taste of there own medicine. Next time everyone pays for their own food or you don\u2019t hang out again. They were just upset they could not take advantage of you like they wanted.", "NTA. Start ordering some **$45-50 dishes.**\n\nIf anyone objects about the cost explain to them that it's roughly the same difference in cost they expect you to cover every time the bill is split.", "Your friends are crafty, you\u2019re subsidising their food and they\u2019re doing this deliberately.

If everyone else is spending 30/40 on their meal, you are also paying for part of theirs and not just your own.

They weren\u2019t doing it on purpose but I don\u2019t drink and they do so their meals/drinks would be exponentially higher . I also didn\u2019t get appetizers often and tend to stick with grilled chicken \u201chealthy\u201d types of dishes.  So after a few episodes of my meals being maybe $25 and having to pay $40 I just started ordering more expensive entrees (adding an extra chicken breast to a salad or adding shrimp with it) to make it so I was paying the same as before but getting more bang for my buck.

You can always get it boxed up to go if you don't want to eat it all? You can afford it after all. It's not a virtue to order a house salad while everyone else has a meal.", "NTA for getting more food but you really should be more firm those boundaries in place. Tell them that they can either let you pay for only your own food or that you won\u2019t be going out with them anymore.

Your 'friends' are using you as a way to have a nicer meal than they can afford", "Stand up for yourself. Ask them if they are just using you for your money. I would never get mad at my friends for wanting to pay for their own food. They sound like leeches.", "I have the opposite problem. Sometimes I want more expensive stuff and I want to get separate checks so my friends don't have to pay for my choices. They still want to split the bill. So I don't order what I want because I don't want to be unfair financially.  Sometimes I just want a second glass of wine!  Let me pay for it", "Info: why do you keep dining out with them??", "NTA. You're in an impossible position based on your friends' behavior, forcing you to do something drastic (like, opting out of every meal for instance, which would be unfortunate). I see nothing wrong with you ordering a normal amount of food in line with what they always order, and their dislike of it suggests they have consciously or not enjoyed getting discounted meals by bringing you along knowing you tend to choose inexpensive items, which they then shun you for if you expect to also pay less. \n\nTo me, this is very telling of your friends. But, maybe as things cool off it will bring about a helpful conversation. The whole group dining out / splitting the check thing is pretty much never simple and it's quite hard without being very meticulous to make it truly 'fair'.", "Honestly, it\u2019s time for a new friend group. They sound awful and entitled. ESH because of how they behave, but you also take some blame because you continue to eat out with them and don\u2019t stand up for yourself.", "Stop eating with them.  Jeeze the problem isn't that hard to solve.", "They're taking advantage of you and they're mad you're not letting them do it. You need new friends. The ones you have right now are assholes.", "Just stop going with them.", "NTA- they want you to subsidize their meals because you make more money? And when you even things up they get pissed? Those aren't friends, those are leeches.", "NTA.. have you considered ordering something more expensive than what they ordered.  If you did this and they said everyone pays for themselves,  its a win win for you and works out in your favour. \n\nYour story reminds me of a guy in my group (when we would each buy a round of drinks) when he was paying he would get the cheap drink, but when someone else was paying it was always of the top shelf..we quickly stopped doing rounds", "You\u2019re only the AH for continuing to allow this to happen to yourself. These people are not your friends. You ordering food equal to the amount they ordered and then getting pissed is proof of that. So 1) stop going out to eat with them 2) go and don\u2019t order anything and refuse to pay 3) stand up for yourself and tell server you are ordering separately with separate bill. \n\nI\u2019ll repeat myself that these people are not your friends.

They cannot afford expensive dinners without you contributing. I wouldn't eat out with them any more.", "NTA. I mean that was kind of an AH move, but I think it was justified to make a point. They didn't like their payment going up because of what you ordered, and you don't like yours going up because of what they order.

It\u2019s always the people who order the most expensive stuff that want to split the bill. I will not be spending more than what my food costs since I was actually smart enough to order food I can afford.", "NTA : order a tomahawk ribeye at every outing until they capitulate.", "NTA.  It's a good lesson for them.", "They are so wealthy that indeed it's too hard for them to calculate it. Because they don't need to. I agree with you.", "This is why wealthy people are wealthy.  They're almost all universally cheap, and will do literally anything to make sure that they're spending as little as possible - while passing the costs on to someone else.\n\nIt infuriates me to no end", "I never understood the bill splitting thing because it's simply not fair and I have no idea how anyone can not get that unless they're intentionally trying to mooch off others for an expensive meal. \n\nIt's really not that hard to just calculate things. GDI Janette, just take out your new iPhone 24230 Pro Master Plus Flip and open that damn calculator app. I suck at math, I stopped understanding algebra beyond middle school, but I still did the calculations a few times as well. It's not math that will put a rocket on Mars, it's literally just adding up the filet mignon and six cocktails you had.\n\nCan you tell this made my blood boil? Spoiler: it did.", "I might even go one step further to test their complaints.  Turn the tables on them.  OP should order last and get the most expensive item so that their bill is more than everyone else.", "Right. I personally see fine dining as the price to pay to hang out with friends without any of us having to cook or host, so I don't mind paying extra. Some people are bad at math, and don't add tax AND tip to their share. And that's ok with me. Most of my friends are generous, and we don't mind paying for those who don't contribute as much. So if OP is always feeling bad about eating out with them, why don't they get together for a different activity?", "This is where I land. Order a dish of equivalent value. Add a protein (or two) to your salad, take the protein home. Ordering a whole nother meal to go was almost theatrical. \n\nAt the same time I find it supremely obnoxious for people to expect to split the bill in a way that\u2019s obviously unfair to one person, and I almost want to applaud OP\u2019s admittedly dramatic response. One time I went to dinner with a bunch of couples. I was the only single person. Someone wanted to split evenly by couple, meaning I would\u2019ve paid double. I said no and others agreed with me, but there was still some grumbling because I made the math too hard (???).", "Not drinking is the quickest way to generate a hatred of people who demand to split the check haha. At least your friends came around. Any time I\u2019ve been very clear I don\u2019t want to spend a lot of money and don\u2019t drink so I will be paying for my own meal, the people I\u2019m with will inevitably whine and gripe when the check comes out and I just pay for what I got and try to make me feel like I\u2019m an asshole.\n\nI never understand why they don\u2019t just stop whining and split the remaining bill among the people who had drinks and expensive dinners.", "OP should try ordering the most expensive items on the menu--starter, main, dessert, and drinks. Then accuse these \"friends\" of being cheap when they complain.\n\nI think I'd just stop going out with them, though; they're not very good \"friends.\"", "They are wealthy. 20$ or 70$ won't make a difference in their yearly budget at all.  \nIf they only go out with equally wealthy people, doing it this way avoids a battle for everyone to be inviting the others as a show of affected generosity.  \nThe struggle comes from the wealth disparity in a group.", "So what? Let them get mad. They actually sound like terrible friends.", "\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffcP R O J E C T I O N\ud83d\udc50\ud83c\udffc", "How I wish gold still existed, this is just perfect. Manipulative, petty, smart, with the end goal firmly in mind. I love it.", "$12-$60? Screw that I\u2019d jump right to $200 just to make a solid straightforward point.", "I like this idea. Very covert", "\"but it eventually evens out where you'll get the more expensive meal!\" No it won't, I'm a supertaster so I have to order the plainest and cheapest food and drink on the menu or I start to aggressively twitch... It's never going to even out. \n\nWas told once the bill was being split no matter what so I refused to eat anything and then the bill. They still tried it on though. Same with rounds of drinks at uni - I wouldn't have a drink and they would get mad that I didn't want to foot some of their drinks bill. I didn't stay in that friend group for long...", "This", "It is really hard to make friends as you get older", "That is also an option, if making your point is more important than keeping your friends. For some people it is.", "Check chicken! Bloody awesome!! I can't wait to try this!", "Yup. His friends are using him.", "Not necessarily. Some cultures always bill split and it's annoying. \n\nWhen my sister moved to NYC she became this way. They argue \"it's just easier for the waitress\" or \"it all balances out in the end\".", "We had a similar friend issue. Never brought cash like everyone else. Always wanted to pay the final bill with their credit card. They were getting to keep everyones slight cash over payment to \u201cround up\u201d and rack up credit card points. Probably a tax deduction for a \u201cwork\u201d dinner too", "I had a coworker do something very similar when a group of us would go to lunch.  Everyone would have cash but him, so he'd take everyone's (7-8 people) money, throw down 3 dollars for the wait staff, get his meal for free and still have cash leftover.  I started short-changing my cash before he collected it, then threw in the rest plus extra tip after he put down the tip.", "Wow thats super wrong of that one person to take the tip part out. Like he really needs that money that badly for himself.  As a server when groups come in alot and don't tip we all know and no one will give ya good service. Or your meals might take a long time, or we won't hear ya ask for refills.  And that's ashame for the people at that party that aren't AHs to get the brunt of it like that. Others shouldn't have to be treated like that for the sins of one.\n\nAlso separate checks aren't that big of a deal if you ask in the beginning that way it can be done in the computer properly. And so they can keep track of who is ordering what. If you ask at the end of the meal especially when multiple alcoholic drinks are ordered it's more annoying trying to remember who got what. \nSO ASK IN THE BEGINNING SO IT CAN BE TRACKED PROPERLY AND YA WON'T GET THE  ATTITUDE FROM THE SERVER AT THE END. We write it down differently as well in our books(or at least I do). I change color pens or have it more organized from the start so it's less of a nuisance. And if apps are being split mention that as well for the same reasons.", "I mean if they keep insisting OP split the check and getting mad at them for wanting their own check, then they kinda suck anyway. Like it's one thing to prefer they split the check, but to get MAD that OP doesn't want to is ridiculous", "I would argue the friend group is acting extreme.", "I wouldn't consider it that extreme. They don't see OP as a friend but rather as a discounted meal ticket.", "Honestly, these don't sound like very good friends.  I have some friends where we always just split the bill and others where everyone wants separate checks.  I find when you value the company the actual few dollars doesn't make that much of a difference to me. It's super weird that you've balked at this many times but it's still an issue.", "Then she stands her ground and demands a split check as they have done.\n\nThey might \u201ccall her bluff once\u201d thinking she\u2019s trying to make a point and then revert. Twice and it will never happen again.", "Yeah. Next time quietly make your order $100 and then tell them to split it. See what they say.", "This makes my blood run cold. Delivery folks are getting screwed from every possible direction these days.", "I would never trust that person EVER again.\n\nGod forbid someone working class enjoy a little generosity.", "Better alone than in bad company - there's a reason for that saying. NTA op", "It sounds to me like OP is telling their version of the story\u2014and that is, that there is no reasonable way to please these people.\n\nBecause realistically they're not getting that much out it. And we're taking OP's word on the amounts of the meals.", "Na then she says \u201cyou know what waiter, cancel that, I\u2019ll have the house salad and it will be separate checks\u201d\nFriends won\u2019t even let her finish ordering before they insist on separate checks", "I don't understand the concept of one bill and everyone pays equally! Why doesn't everyone just order and pay for their own meals? With the new online options, it's pretty easy  to split a bill. Order what you want, and what you can afford, and get a separate bill for each person. The only time something MIGHT be split if the whole table wants an appetizer to share or a bottle of wine/alcohol for all the share. If everyone is ordering separate food and drinks, then there's no reason to split the bill equally.  That is the ONLY fair way to handle it.", "They aren\u2019t the brightest bunch, are they? If the server is already splitting the bill to make the wine separate, then the server could just as easily give everyone their own check, for the specific items they ordered. In many restaurants, servers can also split any shared items (like appetizers) among however many people ate from that dish. No need for sharing the tab at all, IMO.", "People who judge her for asking for a separate check would also probably talk shit about taking the leftovers. They seem insufferable.", "the optical mistake, i think, was openly ordering it to go, she should have just ordered a big meal in the normal order of things, not finished it, and had it boxed and she would have probably tap-danced right around them.", "That's how restaurant systems have worked for 20+ years.", "Did OP say in another post what type group this is? (How they all met). I used to do \"8 at 8\" and you would get revolving people so that you got the chance to meet more people. It was always separate checks. Occasionally, a person would buy a round of drinks or bottles of wine for the table but otherwise it was seperate checks. This group sounds weird.", "Once OP claimed there is literally nothing they can do to jot make them angry I was like - okay, this is more of a rant and there\u2019s absolutely some hyperbole in the comments.", "Haha ok that would work too and still be glorious. \n\nI would watch that movie.", "I 100% agree - if they aren\u2019t willing to talk and listen, and accept OP has different values to them then they don\u2019t sound like great friends. All relationships involve compromise - they need to take a moment to understand OP\u2019s perspective here.", "This thread has made me realize some of my friends aren't real friends.", "And two lobsters I\u2019m hungry tonight", "Oder take out for the week then.", "Right? I want a invite lol", "Well it might be the equivalent of that. From the description of the food, OP just had a house salad while others are eating steak or lobster. But maybe OP just doesn\u2019t want to eat as much. It sounds like the friends are trying to push keeping the group unified without exceptions, and I wonder what their concern really is.", "I thought this but would be a little AH, right? In a good petty way kkkk", "Or go to the restroom and just leave.", "Why drop them? Go out, same check, order to your hearts content. It's like a 75% off coupon AND you lose shitty friends all in one!", "I'm cracking up. Thanks for the laugh!", "Do it with alcoholic beverages and it's drinksmanship!", "No more of an AH move than their supposed friends are already pulling. I really have a short line of patience for people like the Friend group. I despise greedy, entitled and self-centered people who try to take advantage of others, and then play stupid.", "Definitely an evil (but smart) move. They do your work for you.\n\nOn a different note, I wonder if these women leave a decent tip Some places add an automatic gratuity on bigger groups. Hopefully that's what happens here, because I don't think they'd tip well otherwise (and be needy at the same time)."]}
