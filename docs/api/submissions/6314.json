Obviously, my mother is not pleased and is telling everyone I demonized her. (Hmm... If I try chucking holy water at her... we'll never know)\n\nI am moving out of the country for a job opportunity with my current partner. Frankly, I feel like putting as much distance between me and my mother is going to be the best outcome for everyone. We're moving in about 2 months to Switzerland.\n\nAnna and my brother have spoken about what he did. He's apologized and told her that he thought, at that time, that he was ready to move on and be his normal self again but he realized he would need more help. He apologized profusely for what he did to her and he would understand if she didn't want to speak to him again. He's been seeing his therapist regularly again and has cut contact with our mother. Anna was hesitant at first but decided to forgive him, and they decided that being friends would be better for them. We're all meeting (siblings and mutual friends) for a New Year's eve party tonight and we'll have fun (or not since we're extremely competitive when it comes to board games and things get heated (in a good way )\n\nSo, I feel like this is a happy ending for everyone except my mother. I feel a bit bad saying this, but that makes me happy.\n\nThank you for the help and all the comments on my original post and happy New Year!", "created_utc": 1672675012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101fy8l/update_aita_for_not_telling_my_mother_that_my/", "score": 959, "replies": ["Good luck with your new job, happy New Year", "Thanks for the excellent update.
