Your mom should ask him what's the name of his new girlfriend who is on his ass for being a deadbeat for 2 decades.", "He probably needs a kidney, and wants to test if you are a match.  But seriously, I would stand by your Mom on this she was the parent that stayed and raised you.", "NTA. Never wrong to cut toxic people from your life. Best decision I ever made.", "NTA.  Unless the guy was in a coma or lost at sea or something there is NO justifiable reason why he couldn't have been part of your life.  He just didn't want to.  Now that the hard part (raising a child) is done, he's wanting you in his life for SELFISH reasons because HE is lonely or because HE is scared of being left in a retirement home or some other assholish reason.  By all means let him try to explain himself if you want to but he'd better have a DAMNED good reason for not being a part of your life.  I can't imagine he has one.", "NTA. Dude is so desperate over something hes reaching for everything he can think of. A no contact order wouldnt be unreasonable.", "NTA god. NTA. It is your choice. And you do not want a relationship with him. You certainly do not owe him one. Seems like he is trying to hit up your mom.", "NTA\n\nNobody would blame you for not wanting to have a relationship with a man who gave no fucks about your well-being for 22 years", "Nah, you're not the asshole. He had 22 years to make things right and he didn't do shit. Your real dad is the one who raised you, not this deadbeat sperm donor.

You do you.", "NTA, but it sounds like your mom made the decision FOR you. It\u2019s your father, it\u2019s your life, it\u2019s up to you to decide whether he can come around or not. I see people talking about money, if he payed you would you be willing to talk with him? The reality is that nobody knows why a couple didn\u2019t work out other than the people involved. Give the guy a chance on your terms to see where he\u2019s coming from.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m adopted, don\u2019t know my biological parents yet. So I totally think your abandonment is valid. But I do not pretend to understand what the circumstances were that made it so they gave me up. I\u2019m older than you but at 22 I thought who cares if I know my bios. Now it\u2019s a little different, don\u2019t cut yourself short before you know you don\u2019t want it in your life.", "NTA.", "NTA, easy for him to say that \u201cit\u2019s never to late\u201d lol", "NTA - he can raise his other kids, but not you? \nthough you can also tell him to pay 18 years of child support and then you'll think about letting him back in your life lol", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to meet your donor parent if you don\u2019t want to. He forfeited Gus right to be a father when he walked out on you and your mother, gave zero participation or support in your life. He\u2019s just a man you don\u2019t know who shares some of your dna", "NTA - Interesting how he wants to reconnect after you turned 18.

If you never wish to than he has to suck that up and deal with it.

You lived 22 years without him, so you don\u2019t need him around now.

I\u2019d say he\u2019s not worth the time and if he only comes around after a divorce there\u2019s a reason like no one else wants him around or he wants/needs something.
