If other players aren't wearing mouth guards, the coach is probably violating the rules. The National Federation of State High School Associations requires players to wear mouth guards. Ask the coach why he's not requiring them.", "NTA. Although I\u2019m biased because I\u2019m in the dental field. Dentistry is expensive AF. I have seen too many kids lose perfect smiles over a racket/hockey stick/elbow/whatever to the face due to sport. When you have to fix teeth that were perfect six months ago it sucks hearing parents yell at their kid for being too rough and also knowing they never supported them wearing a mouth guard\u2026", "NTA\n\nOther parents negligence shouldn't be your baseline. If/when he gets clocked in the mouth and still has a full smile he'll thank you.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps write an email to the coach about how these should be required and how it would be such a crying shame to get sued if some kid gets hurt.\n\nThen you have a paper trail showing someone has notified them of the oversight.", "NTA \n\nJust the parent. I am assuming since you are picking him up etc that the child in question is a minor\u2010 which means you are still in charge of his heath and safety. A mouthguard is reasonable in full contact sports (and required in plenty of places). So what if the other kids don't wear one, we all grew up riding bikes and snowboards without helmets too (and some people got badly injured or worse).\n\nHe wants to play lacrosse, he needs to wear the mouth guard.", "NTA\n\nObligatory \"If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?\"", "NTA, and wearing mouth guards is a golden rule in most countries for lacrosse.

The other parents/the school should do the same.", "NTA I can hear my father's voice asking \"do you want to be cool or do you want to eat solid foods for the next 75 years?\"", "NTA.  mouth guards should be required equipment.", "NTA. You really need to have a talk with the coach about mouth guards, and if he doesn't enforce them, it all comes down to what you are comfortable with in allowing for your son. When your son is an adult and responsible for his own dental expenses, he can play any sport he wants to without mouth guards, but hopefully by then, he'll realize he does want to protect his teeth no matter what.", "NTA. I played lacrosse, I don\u2019t know how many times I bit my tongue. Mouth guards seem dumb at the time but looking back, it definitely helped.", "NTA. You just never know what will happen. I used to play baseball and would almost always play without a cup on for protection, even though I should have (mostly because it was uncomfortable). The one day I do wear it, I happened to get drilled in the crotch by a stray ball during the opponent's batting practice.\n\nAfter the game I went home and checked it out after cleaning it, and what do you know? I find an inch and a half crack in it. Bought a new one before next week's game and continued to use it for every game after.\n\nJust because it doesn't happen doesn't mean it won't happen.", "NTA, you definitely need a mouthguard for lacrosse. He'll find out why eventually if he plays long enough.", "NTA. There's a high risk of dental injury in lacrosse", "Why isn't anyone else wearing one? That's not good. NTA.", "NTA you\u2019re just keeping your kid safe. I don\u2019t see this as controlling either. I think it\u2019s important to have a talk with the kid about why you\u2019re making his wear it if you haven\u2019t yet.", "NTA.  Safety first!", "NTA, you must explain him that the teeth ends up a bit loose after the orthodontic work, and he would lose it", "PS:  They might not have worn them during training, not sure why, but a player is penalized for not wearing one during a game.", "NTA if that was the one rule for him to play lacrosse then make him wear it. That\u2019s a overall safety problem not even counting the chance of damaging his teeth. I played first and third base in softball as I got older I started wearing a face mask. Just because I never took a line drive to the face doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t have happened. Better safe then sorry in cases likely that.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let up. You\u2019ve invested too much money into those teeth", "NTA. You only get one set of adult teeth. They have to last your forever. I say this as someone with a full top denture, 4 complete and 2 different teeth in half on the bottom. I\u2019m 42", "NTA - frankly I am surprised that wearing of mouthguards are not a requirement to play.  It is clear safety issue and probably opens the club up to liability.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d bring it up to the coach too. All the players should be wearing them.", "NTA - teeth are expensive!", "Nta dental work aint cheap.", "NTA. Its basic safety", "NTA\n\nI played both box and field Lacrosse for 10 years.  We had to wear mouthguards for both.", "NTA. No safety, no play.", "Wtf?! Where is coach? I played hockey in school and we sat on the sidelines if we forgot it", "Take this up with the coach and explain your situation. If he is a good coach he will encourage everyone to wear/get mouth guards", "NTA. Get to know the other parents and find out if they're aware.", "Played girls' lacrosse in high school. We all wore mouthguards despite being a \"non-contact\" sport. Boys' lacrosse is definitely not non-contact. They hit each other with sticks and throw a solid rubber ball faster and harder than girls. You're not even allowed to play without wearing a mouthguard. I don't know how old your son is, but it's negligent on the coach's part to even allow them to play without a mouthguard, especially if they're just learning and thus have less control over the ball.\n\nNTA", "NTA....but taking this up with the coach seems like the best path forward here. As others have said, all the kids ought to be wearing the mouth guards. \n\nAlso....talk to your kid. Be real and direct. Talk about the money. Explain that you're not holding it over his head, but you need to take care of investments. Things happen, money dries up, teeth should be taken care of.", "NAH.

My daughter is very pale, strawberry blond blue eyed Irish pale not the California blond she wishes she was, anyway I was the mom that literally chased her with sunscreen and when you play all the sports it is embarrassing to have mom come to dugout to spray you down but I did not care. I said no sunscreen no sun. Her dad took her once and had read about the dangers of sunscreen, I buy good environmental kind lol, and she came back a lobster like a tea bath in alkaline water lobster, am esthetician as well as mechanic lol, she is now 20 has amazing skin and very few freckles and is religious about her sunscreen.

It's your money that paid for those awesome teeth he now has and your money that will have to fix it should his teeth get broken or knocked out.", "NTA. You gave him a choice: either a mouthguard or no lacrosse. What he chooses to do with that is his problem. Lacrosse takes a huge toll on the body and is a privilege, not a right.", "NTA. Won't say much about judgement as it's pretty well covered. But one very important fact, there's been plenty of comments covering dental health.

Probably during practice or scrimmages when he \u201cthinks he won\u2019t need it\u201d as for him saying *nobody else wears one* you should report his coach immediately. Their coach is endangering everyone on that team by not teaching them the importance of safety wear.

Take it from someone who got an elbow in the mouth playing hurling when she was 12 while not wearing a helmet or mouthguard that two front teeth gettin put back and sorted is painful, expensive and not worth the risk", "NAH\n\nYou are a concerned parent who wants safety for your child. Your child thinks that you are being unnecessary. Some sports require different equipment.\n\nObviously chess doesn\u2019t need nearly the gear that sparring does. Since it sounds like your whole family is new to the sport, I would address this with the coach, who I would hope has a lot of experience. If it\u2019s truly not necessary or recommended, he would know. Never force it on your child though, because chances are if you do, then he\u2019ll end up sticking it in his pocket while playing in the future. \n\nHave a civil conversation with someone experienced, being the coach, and your son. It\u2019s the coaches job to guide and encourage safety anyway, so although it\u2019s good to be a concerned parent, that doesn\u2019t mean you should just make decisions, it means that you should bring up any issues with the people with more experience.
