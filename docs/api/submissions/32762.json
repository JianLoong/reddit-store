Sam and I met in kindergarten and were best friends until his death at the age of 34. He was my brother in every way that counted and he was an amazing dad to Kenna who was 7 when he died and Parker who was 9. A coupe of years after Sam died Erica met Jason. They got married after dating for a year. The kids struggled and never warmed up to Jason much. He is a good guy and has tried to be a good stepdad and even offered to adopt them three times in the years before they turned 18. Neither Kenna or Parker were interested. \n\nBoth kids are very close to me and always treated me like that fatherly role model after Sam died. I was more than happy to fill it. I even promised Sam that I would and that if the kids ever asked me to walk them down the aisle or dance with them at their weddings, that I would. Or to offer if they ever seemed sad he wasn't there and weren't sure what to do.\n\nI didn't need to ask because Kenna asked me the day she got engaged. She said she wanted Parker and me to do it. That I had the long history with her dad and Parker is just as much her dad's as she is. Parker and I both said yes.\n\nJason learned about Kenna asking Parker and me after Erica and Jason wondered why the three of us were planning dance lessons (Kenna wanted to do a special dance and figured some classes could help). Jason was upset. Erica was surprised that Kenna chose me and Parker over Jason and she asked me when Kenna asked and why I said yes. I told her I love Kenna with all my heart and I made a promise to Sam.\n\nLater Jason came to see me and asked me why I said yes when I had to know he would have loved to be asked. He told me I saw him try to grow his relationship with the kids and instead of encouraging her toward him, her stepdad and the man who provided for the household for many years of her adolescents years, I accept it and allow such a big focus to be on Sam. Again. He said it feels like a very big f u to him and a reminder that no matter how long Sam is gone, he will always be put first and prioritized. He said he gets it but it hurts and it hurt more to realize even I don't care about him enough to encourage her to include him instead of me. He said Parker and him doing it would have said she wanted both him and Sam represented. But by asking me it's just Sam. He asked me why I didn't want to encourage that. He left after saying all that and then texted me a few days later saying he felt like I overstepped by agreeing to the role.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702239113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fc6ug/aita_for_agreeing_to_walk_my_niece_down_the_aisle/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Absolutely Ludacris to say you're overstepping because you didn't push your niece into choosing him instead.", "NTA I get that this has hurt him. I think sometimes step parents try too hard. I think asking 3 times to adopt them was excessive and they probably felt him and mom to a degree were trying to erase there dead father. I\u2019d think that in the 2 years after their dad died that you and the kids formed a tight bond. It makes a difference that you are their uncle and have always been in their lives. You need to talk to the young adults and tell them how hurt he is. She has asked you and you accepted which is her decision. But, now that they are adults they need to talk to mom and stepdad.
