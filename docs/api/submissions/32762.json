Sam and I met in kindergarten and were best friends until his death at the age of 34. He was my brother in every way that counted and he was an amazing dad to Kenna who was 7 when he died and Parker who was 9. A coupe of years after Sam died Erica met Jason. They got married after dating for a year. The kids struggled and never warmed up to Jason much. He is a good guy and has tried to be a good stepdad and even offered to adopt them three times in the years before they turned 18. Neither Kenna or Parker were interested. \n\nBoth kids are very close to me and always treated me like that fatherly role model after Sam died. I was more than happy to fill it. I even promised Sam that I would and that if the kids ever asked me to walk them down the aisle or dance with them at their weddings, that I would. Or to offer if they ever seemed sad he wasn't there and weren't sure what to do.\n\nI didn't need to ask because Kenna asked me the day she got engaged. She said she wanted Parker and me to do it. That I had the long history with her dad and Parker is just as much her dad's as she is. Parker and I both said yes.\n\nJason learned about Kenna asking Parker and me after Erica and Jason wondered why the three of us were planning dance lessons (Kenna wanted to do a special dance and figured some classes could help). Jason was upset. Erica was surprised that Kenna chose me and Parker over Jason and she asked me when Kenna asked and why I said yes. I told her I love Kenna with all my heart and I made a promise to Sam.\n\nLater Jason came to see me and asked me why I said yes when I had to know he would have loved to be asked. He told me I saw him try to grow his relationship with the kids and instead of encouraging her toward him, her stepdad and the man who provided for the household for many years of her adolescents years, I accept it and allow such a big focus to be on Sam. Again. He said it feels like a very big f u to him and a reminder that no matter how long Sam is gone, he will always be put first and prioritized. He said he gets it but it hurts and it hurt more to realize even I don't care about him enough to encourage her to include him instead of me. He said Parker and him doing it would have said she wanted both him and Sam represented. But by asking me it's just Sam. He asked me why I didn't want to encourage that. He left after saying all that and then texted me a few days later saying he felt like I overstepped by agreeing to the role.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702239113, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fc6ug/aita_for_agreeing_to_walk_my_niece_down_the_aisle/", "score": 762, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would you ruin your relationship with someone you love to make this selfish man happy.\n\nI get it he wanted to accepted as a father figure but it didn\u2019t happen but his disappointment and feelings are his to manage.\n\nIgnore him and walk the woman you love like a daughter and who loves you like a second father down the aisle with Parker.", "I understand why couples choose to get married in civil ceremonies instead of having a wedding. Seems not worth the stress and criticism that has become interwoven.", "Nobody is the asshole. The bride has all the right to ask who she wants to participate in her wedding. The uncle who has been there throughout their lives was asked and should participate as the bride wants. If the stepfather is the breadwinner and has truly tried and put forth lots of effort into building relationship with the kids and is paying for part of the wedding ( not mentioned if he plans on it) he has every right to be disappointed and sad ( but he has no right to say anything to the uncle or the daughter).  If he was going to help pay for some of the wedding then it is perfectly reasonable for him to withdraw the financial support. And nobody better give him any shit for doing that .", "NTA\nI completely agree with all the people saying this is the bride's choice, but I'd also add that Jason is being selfish in his attitude towards YOU. He thinks he deserves this because he provided for the family? Op, you have put in the work and the time to earn your niece's love, and she wants you to be there because of it. Congratulations on being a good uncle and a good friend. Jason doesn't get to stomp all over how meaningful you've been to your family just because he'd like to have a specific job at the event. You're going to be there fulfilling your promises to Sam, proud of the woman you helped raise, and that's lovely.", "NTA.\n\n\"even I don't care about him enough to encourage her to include him instead of me\" -- this isn't your job. I see this kind of thing all the time with weddings - I can 100% understand why Jason is hurt, but the only person who made the decision is the bride, and she's also the one person he can't openly criticize or talk to about her choice. That's why he's trying to offload this onto you. \n\nUnfortunately her relationship with her stepdad is between the two of them as adults. You can tell him that you accepted because you were honored to be asked and you love her, and that ultimately you respect and care for him but this wasn't your decision to make.\n\nI feel for Jason, but he's the one who's overstepping.", "NTA but maybe encourage some other way he can be incorporated into the ceremony or reception with a special role. Maybe two father of the bride speeches or a shout out from you during yours for so graciously stepping aside and supporting Kenna in creating the day she wanted. He's not Sam and never will be but that's not his fault and it doesn't mean he doesn't deserve recognition for being there all these years. It's her choice and I think you're doing the right thing but it wouldn't hurt for him to be recognized or acknowledged in some way. He's married to her mom and has supported them all these years. That's not nothing.", "Nta this day is not about the stepfather. This is about your niece, your best friend\u2019s daughter. She did not ask her stepfather as she doesn\u2019t want him to walk with her. You were there through the good and the bad from the moment she came into this world. She is an adult who made her choice. It seems like he is competing with your best friend and brother in law who passed away. He over stepped by getting upset.", "NAH  \nFrom your account Jason was a good step father he is entitled to feel disappointed, and Kenna is entitled to ask who she wants.\n\nI think you personally could have shown a little empathy towards Jason knowing how hard he tried to do right by these kids, how does your sister feel with what is going on?", "Jason needs to undestand that this was not an either you and Parker or him situation... it's far more likely that it would have been either you and Parker or just Parker... or nobody at all if (for whatever reason) Parker said no.\n\nThere was no chance of Jason being asked to take on the role of father of the bride.  I get that he's disappointed, but... surely he had to have expected this?  It can't have been a surprise that your niece wouldn't ask him to take on this role?\n\nNAH.", "NTA. Not Jason's wedding, not Jason's call. It's as simple as that.", "No. NTA. There is a difference in opinion here regarding each person\u2019s perception of the same event. SF has the right to be hurt and to feel excluded. But he is wrong to try and make it your problem because it absolutely isn\u2019t. His wife chose him to be her husband. The children never agreed for him to be their replacement father. It hurts, but that\u2019s the reality.", "nta. kenna can decide what she wants for herself, and she did, time and time again where it concerns jason, and again when it came to her getting engaged, and asking you and her brother to walk her down the aisle and dance with her. jason and her mom both overstepped asking you when and why she asked you to do this.", "NTA. It seems like she wouldn\u2019t have chosen Jason regardless.", "\n\nNTA since the bride asked you and her dad was your best freint. But being a step parent, a good one is one of the worst things in the world. Just feel for someone who's been there for the kids gets treated like trash more or less or a ATM. \n\nI feel for the SD and I know ppl here say he should shallow his pride . F that if I were I wouldn't go to wedding since they kids basically don't think he's worthy.", "NTA", "NTA. Mayne one day step parents will realize their step kids arent THEIR KIDS", "NTA your niece asked you. End of story", "What I don't get is why is Jason, and all other people in his situation, surprised by this. I would understand if he had a close relationship with his stepdaughter, and been surprised and hurt by her choosing not to include him in her wedding as a father figure. But he knows she never warmed up to him, he should have expected this. Also, once the bride made that decision and shown she doesn't want him in that role, putting pressure to change it shows you care more about appearances than the relationship. Her caving to pressure doesn't mean she appreciates his role in her life, it's just an empty gesture.\n\n  \nIn any case, it's ridiculous they are blaming OP. The bride would likely just have her brother if he said no, anyway.", "He is right to feel hurt. After giving all the love and support possible from his side, he might have felt betrayed. And he's just pouring it out on OP as he's an easy target. Seriously, who doesn't want to be loved, especially after putting in all the efforts for decades?", "Not even just his best friend's kids - they are his nieces via his sister.", "I also think asking 3 times to adopt was excessive. I would ask once, but let them know the offer always stands if and when they feel comfortable, but you understand if they don't. Asking multiple times can cause pressure and actually create distance.", "I agree with you, but I would say the same thing holds true for children of divorce.  The parents probably saw the divorce coming long before the children.  Even children of divorce need a good while to accept it and then more time to adjust to the idea of a new authority figure in their lives.", "As a step parent I also think it is critical to be as laid back as possible about expectations of what your relationship is going to look like with your step children.  I think way too many try to force their expectations.  I went into step parenting with the idea that my step children may never love me, I would be as supportive and respectful as I could be and whatever they wanted our relationship to be I would respect.  I have a great relationship with my step kids, but I would never presume to be the most important person in my stepdaughter's life.", "I think the idea of being a bonus parent, rather than a 'replacement' parent, really doesn't get enough traction.\n\n*Actively* holding open the space for the memories and the grief.\n\nSaying I don't want to be your parent, you had/have that parent, and I know what you had there can never be replaced.\n\nI want to build something that is just us. All I'm really asking is time. Whatever we get to be, we'll get there in time.\n\nThere should also be compulsory parenting and family and individual training/therapy any time a family gets blended, especially through loss. Or just for everyone, always!"]}
