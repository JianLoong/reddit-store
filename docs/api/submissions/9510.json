I feel you have three options here and need to take one of them for your own sanity:\n\n1) Quit.\n\n2) Go above her head. Tell her boss what is happening.  You've already had it out with her so this should not come as a surprise to her.\n\n3) If you don't want to quit and don't want to be promoted to her job, then decide that you're just going to start making the specific plans--that's your job now.  Pretend she made them.  She'll probably believe you as she doesn't sound like someone who has a good handle on the decisions she's made or the conversations she's had.", "NTA - you need a skip level meeting. She has a boss, talk to them. Her management style is impacting your ability to execute your work.", "ESH. She's clearly not good at her job if this is a pattern you've seen for a while, but confronting her directly isn't the way to resolve it. Keep records and go to her manager and show just how much time she's wasted with her nonsense. Confronting her directly is going to get you nowhere.\n\nMake a plan for whatever your current project is and submit it to her for approval, via email. When she rejects it, take that to her manager to show how she's not doing her job.", "NTA. Every manager needs employees to be honest with them. They don't all *want* it, but they *need* it. But it sounds like your manger has a hard time thinking in concrete terms. \n\nMaybe it's time to take matters into your own hands. She's given you the grand vision (imprecise and unrealistic it may be). Develop the execution plan anyway. Figure out what your team can do, with the resources it has, and try to make that align as closely to her vision as possible.\n\nThen give it to her for her approval. If she wants to go over it line by line, fine, entertain her questions but don't change anything unless and until she PROVIDES SPECIFICS.\n\nIn the end, she'll either refuse to approve the plan (in which case, you've done your due diligence, so if anybody higher up asks you can tell them that there's a plan but that your boss is objecting to it), or she will approve a plan and you'll be able to get things underway.", "INFO: What does your company actually do?

I know it feels like you're snitching, but can you talk to her manager about this? Maybe invite this person to your next meeting so they can see exactly what your boss does to waste time and resources. \n\nDo you love this job enough to stay? Then you'll need to be prepared to defend your position to the higher ups and HR. If this job isn't worth it, start working on your resume.

You guys are oil & water and you don't need to be around when her boss calls her out, she will blame you.", "NTA. Your boss is a phony who somehow landed into a position she has no idea how to manage. No plan? Unheard of. She's using word salad to cover for the fact that she's not qualified for that job.   \n\n\nQuestion though: Why can't you just move forward with developing a plan yourself? If I were you, I'd develop the plan and deliver it to the appropriate people and make sure they knew that it was out of necessity since you and your manager have a fundamental disagreement about the creation of a real, tangible strategic plan.", "INFO\n\nWhat I'm getting here is that it's actually your job to supply the specifics after she gives you the brand specifications. Is that not the case?", "NTA.  I suspect she\u2019s been promoted beyond her capabilities, and this is her way of trying to disguise it.  The problem is that the only thing you can really do is quit (unless there are higher ups who would hear you out).", "NTA.

Your boss is an idiot. But you can't work for her anymore.", "NTA. Start looking for a new job, because she is in over her head and your styles don\u2019t mesh.

However,  I don't know what those job descriptions look like. Tactician is a higher level job,  as opposed to the implementation  team, who have their names by the tasks the tactician decides need to get done to accomplish the visionary goals.  However,  hearing about that meeting,  it's not clear who is supposed to have what role, though obviously the tactician is missing from the actual workstream. Who's the AH depends on who is supposed to be the tactician.", "NAH. \nSo, there's a fundamental mismatch between your styles. You should approach this, either with boss, or boss's boss, not as a problem or that boss is wrong, but as a communications issue. \n\nIE it's not about boss being wasteful or grandious, it's that she's not communicating her vision in a way that you can translate into what you need (a detailed point by point plan). And that you need help explaining to her why your approach will ultimately help you and her be more effective and achieve her vision. \n\nSo if boss needs a full day to map out her grand plan, that's great, but you would prefer that she did that herself, and send you a one page precis, so you can turn it into a pretty gannt chart for the team. \n\nMaybe you need boss's boss to referee or mentor both of you, maybe you can find some HR or PD resources to work thru this until you understand each other better. \n\nDefinitely apologise for losing your temper, but then flip it into how you have been trying to communicate your frustration for a while and she has not been responding or listening to your concerns. If she's a good manager, she should take that on board. If not, then document, document, document and then nope out of there.", "She sounds like a \"take it to the next level\", \"leverage our options\", \"think outside the box\", \"Empower and instill corporate values\", \"Shift a paradigm\", and \"leverage best practices\" type of leader.

Her job may indeed be strategic thinking, but unless your job is also strategic thinking (and you are this a horrible fit for your role), then it\u2019s her responsibility as manager to support you with what you need to succeed. That\u2019s her job, especially after you explicitly asked for more concrete expectations and timelines. \n\nCan\u2019t really tell with you because it\u2019s unclear how reasonable you\u2019re being in this. You repeatedly denigrate what she\u2019s talking about as \u201cgrand thoughts\u201d and \u201cblather,\u201d etc\u2026 when she could be talking about exactly what she needs to be focusing on and what you need to be taking into consideration. It\u2019s entirely possible you\u2019re overly myopic or incapable or unwilling to produce the deliverable being asked if you. However, that\u2019s still sort of on her since she should probably just fire you if you\u2019re actually a bad fit.\n\nUltimately, the buck stops with management. While it\u2019s possible you\u2019re just a crappy worker, it\u2019s almost certain that she\u2019s managing your poorly. Which is her job. People complain that management and executive decision makers get the big bucks and the power, but it\u2019s because the success of their teams is their responsibility to cultivate and achieve. That isn\u2019t working right now.", "This is dangerous though, I don\u2019t know how that might come across to the person above - they could as well think I\u2019m difficult to work with and cause trouble", "High risk strategy. A lot of higher up managers will adopt a hands-off attitude and demand that you engage with your direct supervisor. And they'll make a mental note that you're a troublemaker.", "The boss is in over her head. I'd put my money on the boss taking credit for said plan if OP goes this route. OP has already gone to her boss to discuss these issues. They are now well within their right to move up to the next step/higher up since step one didn't yield a resolution.", "I agree with this, if OP wants to continue doing this job, just do the work without her assistance. \n\nTo OP, I would do the work and track/ document what you do for records. Also, try to keep as much of your communication with your boss in digital form (email, texts, IM, etc.) again, to keep as much on record as possible. I also would only ever email her your work, nothing printed out and given in person/ over the phone (unless they are printed copies of what you've already sent).\n\nIt sucks, but one thing I've learned since entering the workforce is you have to cover your own ass. Unfortunately, your boss has already shown that she will choose her employment over yours; if this grows into an even bigger issue, you'll want to prove that you tried to carry out the job on your end as best as you could.", "This is absolutely the way to do things. You're not going to get her to change. She has proven that to you. You can either let the whole department fail, or take matters into your hands and develop a potential plan.\n\nDo everything by email, so that you have it in a documentable form. I'm guessing that at this point, you would rather get the work done then care about who takes credit. If that's not the case, then CC the higher up supervisor on your email.\n\nThe alternative is letting her crash and burn, but if you were on the call with the supervisors, I'm guessing that you're in a position where you might have some fallout as well. Document everything and put those emails in a folder so that when the time comes, you can show that you have asked her repeatedly to make an action plan with deliverables and that she has not done so, and that the failure of the department to meet goals is not your fault.", "If she needs approval for certain aspects though, and her boss isn\u2019t giving it?", "We have plenty of resources, it's a big well-funded business", "This is scary because her boss might think that I\u2019m the problematic one and difficult to work with and then I\u2019m f\u2019ed", "Is it the way I said it or what I said?", "I did develop a plan and she said we don't need it and it seemed odd to me to just give it to people above like I am stepping over her head, I am worried this would look wrong to them as a behavior, not worried about the quality of the plan I had that she thought we don't need at all", "I actually did develop a plan that I wanted for her to look at and use for the higher-ups but she said we don't need it and it's not helpful to have that specific of a plan. I genuinely don't understand how she works.", "That was my take, too. As a manager I don\u2019t have the time to handhold and micro manage my employees on every single aspect of their job. If you want to move up, I expect you to show that you\u2019re capable of doing the job you were hired for and have the aptitude to think ahead. \n\nThat said, I do have employees who either aren\u2019t there yet or honestly can\u2019t plan their way out of the parking lot, let alone plan a high profile project. I help them and try to advance them, but if it becomes obvious they aren\u2019t capable they just don\u2019t get to do that anymore. And if at their level they should be able to do that kind of planning but can\u2019t or won\u2019t, I show them the door.", "I don\u2019t understand this, sorry. the two of us are responsible for setting the strategy and the roadmap (tactics) for how the team (including ourselves) will go about executing the said strategy to achieve the goals we all collectively have. she is just refusing the concept of a tactical plan", "IMO it\u2019s impossible for there to be NAH because at a minimum the boss is failing to provide a successful management environment for OP to succeed.\n\nNow, it\u2019s possible that\u2019s because OP is ALSO a pain to work with or bad at their job\u2026 but in that case manager is still at fault for not moving OP to a different role with a better fit or firing them.", "She does use the phrase think outside the box A LOT", "Then that shouldnt be a place you should be working.

It could be a good idea to ask if you can have meetings (like every other week or once a month or whatever) with the grand boss just in the name of mentorship/ development something like that.

You really don\u2019t think she\u2019s already blaming you for things being off since she got there?

Someone above her.", "OP has already done that by taking her grievances to her boss. Boss didn't budge. The next step is to go higher. You never start out by jumping over the boss's head, but once you go to the boss and follow proper protocol and the boss sits on her hands, fair game.", "This is what I am worried about, that if I bring this up with people above then I'll look like I can't work with people and am insubordinate and just difficult", "Well, yes. But then a manager isn't there to tell everybody exactly how to execute on their jobs. I can tell you that my role as a manager (in the aerospace and IT consulting industries) is to *sell* the work of my subordinates to the rest of the company, and by extension to customers.\n\nSo, there is an important role for vision, goal setting, \"big picture\",  and all that. A manager has to break down what their people do into an appealing story that leadership can understand. A manager should *also* be able to connect on specifics and details, and clearly that is lacking here. \n\nOP has to ask themselves what they really want -- do they want their manager to approve an actionable execution plan?

She shouldn\u2019t be able to get away with incompetence, and she\u2019s dragging you down. Is there a colleague at your level who can back you up? In my experience, good managers can usually tell who\u2019s not really pulling their weight, or who is bsing. I bet they already have their eye on her. And as she is your superior, she can\u2019t really just blame you. If your work is substandard, they can ask why SHE isn\u2019t doing something about it.", "If that happens, you were fucked anyway.\n\nAlternatively, just get a new job. I\u2019m like 70% sure you\u2019re an engineer/technical developer or maybe a PM of some sort based on this story, so you should have no problem finding another opportunity with a manager you don\u2019t hate.", "Stand back and let her sink or swim, its on her. Just document everything, everything big or small. Have your action plans ready. Her boss will come asking soon enough about things. It won't be easy.
