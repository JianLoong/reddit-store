When I was 14, my mom sent me to live with her parents. Her excuse was that they needed me to help out.

They were also quite wealthy as well.\n\nThey both passed 4 years ago a month apart. They gave me the property (because \"I would appreciate and respect it more\") while my mom and sister(s) got money and other assets(overall valued moer than the property).\n\nIn the past 4 years, I turned part of the property into a venue for mainly weddings (GPs knew of this idea and thought it was a good one).\n\nWe are busy and usually booked about 8 months out. My sister got engaged 1.5 years ago and said she wasn't to get married at the property. I said yes, just let me know the date as soon as possible so I can make sure it is \"booked.\"\n\nI never got a date. I followed up several times and kept asking her, and she would brush me off. 2 weeks ago I got the wedding invitation. Stating the property is the location and the date.

It is OUR family's property. How she already sent out the invitations and couldn't go back now. I should just tell the other couple to cancel (they have been on the books for over a year now, and I actually like them).
