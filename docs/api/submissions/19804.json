She can\u2019t escape and your access and relationship could suffer if she experiences any consequences.\n\nI\u2019d try to call around to some of the more obvious vendors and ask if someone else has booked your location. Or straight up ask your mom or sister when vendors they planned to use. I\u2019m sure most of them would be booked months out as well.\n\nHonestly this entire situation is baffling. The only thing I can think of logically is that they forgot you are also a wedding venue and just assumed you\u2019d be free. But even that seems rude. Normally there would be save the dates that would go out before invites even.", "Unfortunately I\u2019m not surprised to hear that after hearing that she literally sent you away. At the same time, I\u2019m getting the impression that you may have dodged a bullet by getting send away to your grandparents which you seem to have loved.", "That\u2019s not a bad idea. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s humiliated to have to say that to them, but based on what he\u2019s said I wouldn\u2019t put it past them, and security may be a good idea. I\u2019d make it clear in advance to his family too that if they show up, they WILL be kicked out and arrested for trespassing if necessary. Also, I hate to say it (because I know it\u2019s not the responsible thing to do to get the clients involved in family drama) BUT - if I were getting married there and found out about this, I would have some much appreciation for them that despite the slander and the pressure, the owner would not screw me over just because his family decided they wanted it last minute.", "Pointing into a nearby lake", "Tell me they at least invited you to the steel cage match.

She probably got one of OP's cousins who has a passing interest in photography to agree to use their iPhone to take pictures of the wedding.\n\nAnd the catering... she probably expected OP to include that with the venue.", "Yeah I thought that was the case. You don\u2019t become that entitled and getting all your gross family members rallying by being kicked out at 18 and raising your little brother. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry your family treated and continues to treat you like that, that\u2019s not a good family", "To be honest we don't know if they are sweet or not. What we do know is that they followed the process of formally booking the venue. Literally the lowest bar to clear. They've probably paid a deposit.\nThey could be total bridezillas and it wouldn't matter, because they have followed the proper procedure and OP is obliged to honour it.", "Don't put the name of the actual clients anywhere visible.

Part of my childhood trauma is from having to pass info around in my fam and then seeing it all blow up because I made tiny mistakes with my words (Typical 8yo mistake) and feeling guilty because my family was fighting because I didn't \"do the job well\". \n\nTalk to your ADULT sister and her ADULT fiance about their lack of communication and preparation and their very CHILDISH retaliation against your livelihood. \n\nDo not move the other sweet couple's date. They might already have payed non refundable deposits and it will not be a good color on your business", "Just piling on here. Do NOT put your little sister in the middle of all this.

Ew, no thanks.", "I do not know of anywhere in the US police reports are NOT public record.", "NTA - Others are encouraging you to get a lawyer.

There is plenty of family that will do it properly but there is always some that won\u2019t so it\u2019s best to make clear guidelines to begin with. Even then some will still complain and say it\u2019s wrong to charge family or even expect family to adhere to rules or boundaries. I just make shirts and stickers as a hobby and have had plenty of family and friends of family come to me like if I provide this and that will u do it for free or at cost of ur material. Or you have the ones who you give a discount to then they go tell their friends and in laws that you can do the same for them. It\u2019s a never ending cycle if you don\u2019t set clear boundaries and just not mix family with business.", "They generally only say \"family above everything else\" when that family is them, or one of the favorites.

Wondering if his attorney could do something with that...", "Yeah. I can\u2019t imagine the gall of his family to just say- cancel the other couple. Like what? How would they like it if someone did that to them?       \nOP did everything in his power to get them to book with him early. Perhaps they didn\u2019t realize how popular his venue had become but that\u2019s on them.

They've had the place booked for over a year. They shouldn't have to move their date at all, especially since they might have to wait months for a new one.

Mom told me stuff about him & since he never reached out to me & she allowed me to talk to him on the phone or see him whenever he was nearby (he lived in a different county) I always said no. Because of how my mom set everything up, I always assumed that my dad never wanted to see/talk to me to begin with since I never saw or heard from him growing up until I was in high school, not even a card. At that point, I didn't want to have someone in my life who had never made an effort.\n\nHowever, now looking back on my life, I realize that my mom could've easily played me. By being so accepting (outside of her telling me bad stuff about my dad) of my dad meeting me & giving me these \"opportunities\" to talk to him, she set me up to believe that she never tried to keep him away from me but MY CHOICE instead. It could've been her plan all along, and this topic is sensitive bc I feel rejected from my own dad, so I never bother to find out the real truth & speak to him.

But, really, how is OP supposed to know her food choices? \"We want a grazing table and 8 passed appetizers for cocktail hour, and we we want vegan dish/chicken/beef fillet\" etc. - it all affects price/dietary needs/allergies/religious requirements, so it has to be discussed and agreed upon long before the wedding?
