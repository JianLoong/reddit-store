If your ex stepMIL is so concerned, she can buy the gift to give. But, I would not be buying gifts for my ex's AP kid", "NTA This is bizarre. If anyone should pay for presents from your kids to their half-sibling it should be their father. You have nothing to do with it and it's a total cheek to try to involve you at all.\n\nThe argument that the kid is innocent is irrelevant. The father of all of them has solely responsibility for the intricate problems he created by having a child this way. His parents need to be on his case, not yours -- and they can always buy the presents themselves. They have no moral high horse from which to look down on you to pressure you to pay.", "NTA.  It's Christmas, not a competition.  Your ex in-laws sound exhausting.  Listen to your ex and cut ties.", "NTA \n\nIt is on the shared parent to supply gifts amongst them, not you.  If the step grandma is concerned she can also supply a gift but it is not on you to do so.", "NTA\n\nIs your stepmother-IL a homewrecker too?\n\nAsking for a present for an affair kid?!", "i'm confused by the first sentence.  is this a full and not half sibling?  is the sibling a result of cheating? or he was born after you broke up and was raised with a new father figure?", "God, I know you are so glad you are no longer part of this deranged family. Tell ex-MIL she is always available to purchase a present for the AP kid but you will never. The AP can do whatever she wants as it is well documented she doesn't respect boundaries anyway. I would not cut off ex-FIL unless he is as shitty as his son but I would definitely establish some solid boundaries. You are no longer their DIL so they should not be having personal conversations about your life choices", "NTA if they want your kids to give him a gift they can buy it themselves", "NTA, but also the kid is innocent and we buy stuff for our sibling.  Ex is idiot,  but you dont have to be.   Just take you kid to a store, ask them to pick out one item each for 1- 10 dollar and it is  sorted.  If you dont want to  do it, ask your kids stepgran to do it.", "NTA\nYou had no way of the the AP was going to buy gifts for your kids. \n\nNow that you know it would be appropriate to buy gifts for the other kid as well if you\u2019re going to keep taking your kids to your ex\u2019s parents home at gift giving times since your ex has made it clear he wants no part of what you\u2019re doing.", "INFO: is the brother a result Of an affair? Even if so it\u2019s not fair to hold him accountable for the actions of your ex husband and the other woman. You should be welcoming a relationship between your children and their BROTHER, even if their dead beat dad doesn\u2019t encourage it. \n\n\nFor now NTA. It was nice of the boys mother to gift your children and it certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt you to do the same moving foward but clearly that won\u2019t happen.", "NTA for not buying the gift, but your ex does not want the kids around his dad for a reason.

Your ex step-mil needs to take a step back and realize she\u2019s meddling where she doesn\u2019t belong. The fact is, you don\u2019t actually even need to facilitate a relationship with your ex-fil and your kids, but you do, even when your ex doesn\u2019t put in the effort.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure the AP isn\u2019t buying gifts for your kids out of the kindness of her heart.
