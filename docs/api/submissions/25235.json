One who doesn\u2019t have the happy memories, but WILL have the baggage of the past should he learn his family history, or do a family tree in school. \n\n\u201cWho am I named after?\u201d\n\u201cYour ggpa.\u201d\n\u201cBut it says Cyrus on the family tree.\u201d\n\u201cIt was his nickname.\u201d\n\u201cHow did it get from Cyrus to Bobby?!\u201d\n\u201cIt was given to him when his dad remarried to match stepmother\u2019s dad.\u201d\n\u201cBut he was named after his mom\u2019s family.\u201d\n\u201cI guess they wanted him to be part of the family.\u201d\n\u201cThey just took it from him? That\u2019s messed up. Why would you name me that then?\u201d", "It's not about whether any given person thinks of it. It's about avoiding being asked the same annoying question over and over and people assuming your parents might be dumb. One needn't LIKE either of these musicians to be aware of their existence.   \n\n\nIf you name your kid Adolf, Barack, Cher, Lennon, Prince, etc. many people will think it's a tribute to specific people regardless of your actual reason.", "Why were his kids annoyed? Did they hate his given name?", "I wonder what the other repliers think this reference is?", "I used to know a couple who divorced over betrayal of kid names. They agreed to name the child Cam with Chris as a middle name. However, Dad wanted to name the child Chris, so Dad wrote Chris on the paperwork and Cam as the middle name (Mom was tired from birth and trusted husband). It didn\u2019t go over well. Last I knew, Mom called kid Cam and Dad called kid Chris. This was like 20 years ago and I lost touch with them. I hope kid is okay and grew into a well-adjusted adult. Cam Chris, if you see this and need any help, DM me.", "Some people don\u2019t think that children deserve basic respect.  I always go by a nickname, which is just a shortened form of my name.  My legal name is on all paperwork and things, of course (if you start putting nicknames on official paperwork\u2019s IDs and things, it causes nothing but trouble).  When I was a child, I had this teacher who insisted on calling me by my full legal name.  Even though I had proper paperwork saying what I was to be called at school.  And I told her multiple times what my name was.  She was a bully.  She never stopped saying it any time she saw me until I left that school.  She knew it caused me distress.  I\u2019ve thought about changing my name and when I was a kid I thought I might do that because of how much some people (like her) were dicks to me.  But as an adult, I find it not worth the effort.", "Can I ask. How well known is that in the family. Is the animosity something that your sister was aware of (essentially did she have the puzzle pieces together? Knowing the name was given by step mom and how he hated his dad and step mom. His name is actually Cyrus and it\u2019s the name on his grave?)", "Please tell me you weren't going to name your kid Gigi", "You are reading way too much into it. Bobby will hate or love his name for his own reasons just like every one of us do and just like he would if his name were Cyrus. My grandmother was apparently amazing but I still hate that I am named after her because I hate the name. It has nothing to do with the history but how the name is now. Now, if OP and the family mistreat Bobby because of his name, then Bobby will hate the name because of that and OP\u2019s sister certainly should take that thought into consideration when making her decision but it doesn\u2019t sound like OP plans on continuing the abusive history, despite the people on Reddit who sure seem to want to add some abuse on their sister.", "They had always said their dad was Bobby. To them Cyrus just wasn't his name even though they all are perfectly aware it was his name and that it was the name that was part of his actual family and not just \"the random woman his dad brought into the house\". Some wanted to name their boys Bobby after him and he stepped in each and every time to make his feelings clear. But to them he was their dad, Bobby.", "The Last Question by Isaac Asimov.", "Maybe he goes by Cyrus the Virus like the dude in Con Air.", "All of grandpa's kids know his real name was Cyrus.\n\nAbout 10 of grandpa's grandkids know his real name was Cyrus, now about 11 with my sister being told. The rest of us were told because we were old enough that he was very honest about his hatred of Bobby and his hatred of his dad, stepmother and half siblings.\n\nAnother 7 are unaware as they were young when he died, like my sister was.\n\nHis name is Cyrus and it is on the grave, yes. I know the \"kids\" wanted to cover up the name Cyrus and add Bobby but that didn't happen.\n\nAmended to 7 because I forgot a couple of cousins.", "Hahaha not a fan?? Pregnancy ended in miscarriage, but I do think I would\u2019ve went with Gigi. Oddly enough my other choice was Santina to honor my aunt who passed away. Her name was Concettina, which she also hated and legally changed her name to Tina but I thought with our last name starting with a \u201cT\u201d Tina didn\u2019t sound right. Guess there\u2019s a tradition of hating our names in my family \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I think you\u2019re missing the point of my replies. You said you found it hard to believe the sister didn\u2019t know the details of grandpas name change and how he felt. I said it\u2019s not unbelievable she wouldn\u2019t know and used my own family situation as an example of why I think that.  Nowhere did I say that I think either OP or their sister is in the right or wrong for their actions or responses.", "I am reading nothing into it. I am simply following the question through to the future. The kid might still like his name and not care at all, or he might be very disturbed that mom gave him a name that has a crappy history she knew about in advance. He might hate that he was given the name because of empathy for his ancestor, or his own feelings about familial abuse. \n\nIt\u2019s not about whether you like the actual name, but the question of why someone would still give the name to another loved one who could be disturbed about its questionable links. Especially since questionable naming is very under fire these days and you have no idea what the attitudes of the future will be.", "If your grandma also called him Cyrus why did all his kids think of him as Bobby?", "I said, Put\u2026 The Bunny\u2026 Down.", "Ok so all the kids and majority half of the grandkids know explicitly. \n\nHow about the abuse portion (because renaming a child to erase their dead parent) is emotionally abusive. Does everyone know the relationship between grandpa and his dad+stepmom where strained?\n\n\nEdit: and does the family know Bobby was the nickname? And that the nickname was started by stepmom? \n\n\n(Essentially are the facts known but people aren\u2019t connecting the dots that grandpa hated the name?)\n\nFor instance I know that my great grandfather was not only a gambler but also extremely abusive, I know his grandfather was sold by his step dad into indentured servitude for a donkey. So I do know sometimes these stories get passed down. But it took me until adulthood to realize that the gambling issue is why my grandfathers family had to move out of a city and into an impoverished rural community that increased the abuse.", "Just curious what kids wanted to add bobby to the grave? The remaining half sibs/their families or his own lineage?", "I think Gigi is so cute! Haha", "Why does any parent give their children the names they do? Because they like the names.", "Around grandpa's family (extended) she called him Bobby because he didn't want her to face backlash from the family. By the time he was so done that he hated his extended family and distanced himself, they were all older and didn't care if he wanted to be Cyrus, he was Bobby to them."]}
