It's why he had such hatred for the name and for a lot of the people who used it.", "The point is that if you choose a baby name for the purpose of honoring a beloved family member, how said family member felt about the name matters. \n\nMy dad was given a name that several members of his family already had, so his family called him a shortened version of his middle name and he absolutely hated it. I actually cringe a little bit when his siblings refer to him by it, because I know that to him, it wasn\u2019t his name and it wasn\u2019t how he wanted to be known. If I were to name a baby after my dad, I wouldn\u2019t give him that nickname, because I know my dad would not have felt honored by that. \n\nIf the sister had just chosen the name because she liked it, that would have been totally fine. But because she specifically said she picked the name in honor of her grandfather, the fact that her grandfather hated the name and didn\u2019t consider it his is important.", "Except that she kept saying the grandfather would be proud to have his name passed down. It sounds like her grandpa would\u2019ve been upset that the name name that was forced on him, not even his real name, is what was passed on, not his true name. It\u2019s fine for her to want to use a name that she associates with her grandfather, but she needs to do so understanding that she isn\u2019t passing on the name he would\u2019ve wanted passed on.", "If she was close to her grandpa she would\u2019ve know this.  He would\u2019ve talked to her about it.  Just like how OP knows the truth.", "He told me he hated them.", "The comment you're replying to is made by op.", "This is true.

It\u2019s one thing to have a weird nickname stick around. And quite another to battle having your name stolen from you. That\u2019s essentially what happened. \n\nAnd I feel for the sister who is now being reminded of this fact. But OP stated facts. And it\u2019s on the sister now to make an informed decision instead of blame her sister for ruining a name. The name was already ruined and represented something bad. Op made sure her sister was aware of all the info.", "Exactly. Or maybe he decides he's more of a \"Rob\" than a \"Bobby\" when he's all grown up.", "I mean, I know someone whose parents let them name their younger sister when they were five so their younger sister is named after one of the Thundercats. That doesn't make it a good idea.", "The name can still evoke positive feelings for his granddaughter though. He isn\u2019t owed a grandchild named after him and she can still name her child whatever she wants. You missed the point. She didn\u2019t know the negative connotations/history when she knew him and she associates that name with her happy memories with him.

And this post is giving me ideas on baby names too, lmao", "His real name, Cyrus, was used at the funeral, much to the annoyance of his kids and half siblings who showed up.

Such a dick move.", "Yeah I feel like this happens a lot. People continue to call someone by the name they\u2019re familiar with despite someone telling them what they prefer, and in this case what his legal name was. It\u2019s crazy. \n\nSimilarly, when I was pregnant I wanted to name my daughter after my grandmother Josephine \nbut she hated her name and went by Jo, Jack, or Gigi (her birth name was actually Giuseppina and was changed to Josephine when they came from Sicily). I think Josephine is a pretty name, but I kept thinking how she hated her name and was considering using Gigi instead.

So we were binned.\n\nStill some family members (FM 1 and 2) tried to get me to get my partner to talk with my other family member (Dude) with whom I have not talked for over 17-20 years, because the Dude was trying to break into the field my husband is working in. As far as I know, Dude never even knew about it, it was FM 2's idea, conveyed by FM 1. Telling me to think about what I owe to FM 2. So I laughed and laughed and told FM 1 that a, how did they imagine that going because as I said, Dude had no idea about the thing, b, what they were talking about owing  happened when I was under 10, I literally had no choice. And c, even if I did owe something, how exactly does that make my husband by extension responsible for \"paying up\".\n\nOdd couple of talks.

I was having lunch with him at his retirement complex when one of the staff referred to him as \u201cBob\u201d, and he didn\u2019t correct them. It turned out his legal first name was Robert and Ed was short for his middle name. It was a few years later, when one of my cousins named a son after our grandpa, that I found out that his middle name wasn\u2019t even Edward. Ed was short for a totally different name!

Grandpa Cyrus was so traumatized and upset at the erasure of his dead mother he apparently didn't even let his kids see his dad and stepmother before they died. \n\nIt's like, if my kids tried to honor me by naming grandkids after my abusers or by using my deadname. It's disgustingly disrespectful if they were aware of the circumstances.", "This. Naming a kid after the dead isn't for the dead, it's for the living. She had happy memories that all involved Grandpa Bobby, who she at the time didn't know of any complicated feelings about the name she was taught to be his.

Would you consider forcibly changing a kid's name against their wishes to be emotionally abusive?\n\nBecause I personally do, and the thought of someone using a name that is an artifact of child abuse as a way to honor someone who was abused? It's utterly horrifying to me.", "The name Bobby is incredibly common, but frankly so is hating your name. I am named after both my grandmothers (one I never met, one I hated) and my reasons for hating my name (first and middle) are because they are ugly old lady names, not because one of my grandmas was an abusive witch. I don\u2019t hate my parents for either name, they did their best even though they saddled me with this ugly name.\n\nThe sister may say it\u2019s to honour him but clearly it\u2019s to honour her memories of him and those memories are tied to a name. She is naming her kid, not putting up a plaque in his honour. Chances of the kid hating the name are high anyways, and it\u2019s hard to pick a name for your kid (someone always hates it) so all you can really do is pick something you like.

They are not here, it does not matter to them. It matters to the people who are alive and the pregnant person has positive memories associated with the name, so who cares?\n\nMy grandfather hated his name (hence he went by a nickname) and didn\u2019t speak to his family. But I liked the name and it was his name despite the nickname (and the nickname is not something you should name a child), so to honour my own feelings about my grandfather and my positive memories of him, I was prepared to name my kid after him. In the end we had a girl so she got a different name."]}
