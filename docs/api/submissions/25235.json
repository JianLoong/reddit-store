And if those people are your parents/stepparents, it can be almost impossible.\n\nOne of my cousins wanted to switch from \u201cTommy\u201d to \u201cTom\u201d when he was a teenager. Took his own family, who didn\u2019t mind the change, almost two years to completely overcome the impulse to say \u201cTommy.\u201d\n\nOne of my siblings is named Frederick. The family calls him Rick to distinguish him from all the other Fredericks in the family.\n\nOutsiders tend to immediately shorten his name to \u201cFred.\u201d He has fought a loosing battle to be called Rick his entire life.  People just don\u2019t get that there could be a different nickname. My brother has mostly given up the struggle with most people. Only his family and really good friends call him by the name he wants to use.\n\nThe first time someone called the house and asked for Fred, I told them no one by that name lived there, so completely is he Rick to me.

Your sister wanted to Honor your grandpa and grandpa hated the Name Bobby. So you were right to Tell her that", "Why didn't you mention any of that in your OP?", "I wasn't angry when I told her. It was said in a more here's a heads up on all the info kinda way. I am frustrated now because of how she responded after at first accepting it.", "He was open about it with a few of us and when he wrote his will and planned his funeral, he was clear that he wanted Cyrus on his headstone and not Bobby, etc. He also told some of the grandkids the story. But the others who were told are mostly estranged.", "I had it written originally but the post was too long so I started from scratch and removed stuff or shortened it to make it fit. That's why I mentioned what I knew but not how.", "Okay fair enough but as someone personally naming a baby rn if I was set on a name, and until that very second thought it had a sentimental value I\u2019d be heartbroken and possibly defensive to hear otherwise.", "Oh OK. I was just thinking that it's weird how no one else knows.\n\nI mean, I don't really have any judgement tough, so I guess NAH. If you felt your sister was doing your grandfather a disfavour by naming her son Bobby, then that's fine, but if she had her name set on. Bobby and really though she was doing something nice for him, then it's not unreasonable that she's upset.", "Sadly, few in the family acknowledge it even though it's widely known. Most people are like oh well I knew him as Bobby and that's what matters. The grandkids who were under 10 when he died would be the few who have no idea."]}
