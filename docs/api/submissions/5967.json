It sounds like he asked you directly and you\u2019re using his daughter as the go between. You also don\u2019t need to threaten the proposal when you ask. Just ask the man for your money back and see his response. If he doesn\u2019t/can\u2019t pay you back and that irks you so much you won\u2019t propose, break up with your girlfriend and let her be free to find someone who won\u2019t put conditions on her future.", "YTA\n\nShe can't control her family's actions anymore than you can control hers.

No question about it. \n\nHowever it\u2019s weird to me that you\u2019re bargaining a proposal over it. These things need to be mutually exclusive and you need to have a conversation with your girlfriend so you are both on the same page about how you\u2019ll loan out money once you\u2019re married.

Tell them it has been a  while since you loaned them the money and that you\u2019d like to work out the details of when and how they will pay you back.

Just don't help them out again in the future, and make sure your girlfriend understands why (they have clearly shown you that they can't be trusted to pay you back) and agrees with you, that her familys issues with money are their own and not your responsibility. If she is a reasonable person, this doesn't have to come between the two of you. You also marry her family to some extend, yes - But you decide where your boundries are, and if you and your girlfriend agree on these boundries, there\u2019s no reason why your future together should be dictated by her familys shortcomings when it comes to finances.\nYou probably won't see your 1000$ again, regardless of you marry her or not - Just make sure you won't be giving them more money ever again, and that this is a decision you both agree on!", "YTA - ??? So you are assuming that if you marry this woman that her family is going to see your money as their money because you loaned her dad $1k 1.5 years ago.  Dude, you are using this as a crutch.  All you have to do is say \"no\" if they ask for money.  No means no and is a complete sentence and does not need explanation.  If they come back with \"family helps family\" then shoot that down real quick by letting them know that that is manipulation and a guilt trip and won't fly.  Seriously, you said that $1k isn't even denting your savings.  Chalk it up to learning a lesson and get on with your life.

Be sure to take \"the family\" to small claims to let her know what she's missing out on.", "INFO: Have you asked him for the money back? Can he provide you with a timeline of when you can expect it?\n\nAlso, I don't think this is a good enough reason to not want to marry your partner. Honestly, I would forget about the money he owes you. It's unlikely you'll get it back. Is there a way you can legally protect your money so that once you're married she can't just give it to her parents whenever they're struggling.", "YWBTA if you try to shake her father down using your future marriage as leverage. That is a complete AH move and disrespectful to your GF. I agree he should pay you back, but it is not your GF's fault that her father doesn't keep his word. If this is the only think keeping you from marrying this woman, ask yourself this. Is your GF worth $1000 to you? If not, then don't get married. If she is, then kiss the money goodbye and move on with your life. Let it go, and consider it a lesson learned.\n\nMake sure you discuss this with your GF BEFORE you get married. Ask her what she plans on doing once you are married, if her family asks for money. Any money she gives is BOTH of your money no matter who's paycheck it comes out of, and there must be mutual agreement to give the money. Nip this in the bud. If she is not willing to agree that lending your marital money must be mutually agreed upon, then I would think twice about marrying her because this could a real problem for your marriage if she is giving away money that was supposed to go towards meeting your financial goals as a couple. Since she doesn't have a great background in money management from growing up with a family that didn't plan or budget well, make sure you have ALL the discussions about how finances will be managed in the marriage. Joint or separate accounts, spending limits, will she stay home or work when you have kids, etc.", "YWBTA. The agreement was between you and her step father and you shouldn\u2019t penalize her. A good rule of thumb is never loan money you wouldn\u2019t freely give, because there\u2019s a good chance that it will end up a gift anyway. Legally, you aren\u2019t tied to these people, and if you marry, you\u2019ll only legally be connected with your wife.

Look who is punishing a woman for the mistakes of men? \n\nThat would be you.  This was an agreement between two men, though, right?   And, I highly doubt you truly love her if you are holding your relationship over her stepfather\u2019s head.  1k without a written and signed agreement?  That\u2019s your stupid tax, bro.\n\nAlso, you need to have a serious talk with your would-be fianc\u00e9e about how the Bank of OP is now closed to her family, and you will never again agree to give or loan them money from your private and/or combined accounts. \n\nYTA.

Giant. First, the ick factor here ... you won't marry a woman you claim to love unless you get your 1k back ... is high. Second, every grown up in the world should know this ... if you can't afford to lose the money, don't lend the money. Consider every loan as a big \"bye-bye\" to your cash. All you have to do at this point is tell the family that this was your one and only financial gift, then get on with your life with the woman you claim to love. However, if I were she, I'd bounce out of this relationship.", "NTA.  Eighteen months is more than enough time to start paying someone back.\n\n Nicely, ask for the money back.

Can you trust her to not give them money once your money becomes y\u2019all\u2019s money? When you marry someone, you get stuck with the family. Is this going to become a big enough problem where you\u2019re going to have to cut her parents out at some point and how is she going to react if that happens? I would tell the dad you need your money back and he firm. You might need to accept that you will never see the money again, can you get over that?

You alone determine whether or not these people \"leech money off of you.\" To do it all you have to say is no. And while we're talking about lending money to family, it's a good time to accept that you just shouldn't lend money to family (or anyone you want to maintain a close relationship with) that you can't afford to give away. Why? Because they might not pay you back and you want to avoid situations like this. \n\nYou and your gf need to be on the same page 100% about lending or giving money to her family.

It's gone. \n\nTalk to the girlfriend. Let her know that going forward you won't be willing to provide financial support to her family. How does she react to this? What is her expectation on supporting her family? Is she going to be handing over all her cash without talking to you and expecting you to pick up the slack at home? You two need to have a conversation about finances and how that looks in the future when you're married.", "ESH. Step dad should have paid you back. You should have asked him for the money yourself. As for not marrying your girlfriend because her step dad owes you money? If I were your girlfriend, I would take that as a sign that you didn\u2019t really want to marry me. My view is that people who want to do things, like get married, find a way to make them happen. People who don\u2019t want to do things find reasons to not do them.  The best interpretation of your position is that you & your girlfriend need to have some serious conversations about how you will handle money during your marriage. Suggest you do that instead of making this debt a hill to die on.", "Just to be clear you are refusing to move forward in a relationship with a woman you claim to love because of unpaid $1000 loan? $1000?

Doesn't mean it's right that you haven't been paid back but if you let this get in the way of marrying the woman you supposedly love then that says a lot about you.\n\nIn my eyes you have two options:\n\n1. consider the loan forgiven and never let them borrow money again.\n\n2. break up with your girlfriend because if this is enough to change your plans for the future then you're not ready to commit to someone anyway.\n\nEither way you're likely out $1000 but do you want to keep her in your life or not?", "NTA, set up a payment plan with him. 1k is a lot of money for a family that is struggling. Ask him to pay you back $100 a month. If that's too much then $75 a month. \nNever let her family borrow money again, if it an emergency, get collateral that must be worth more than the loan amount.", "YTA\n\nYou obviously have misgivings about marrying into this family. Its a reasonable worry but you do need to let your poor girlfriend go so she can find someone who will appreciate her despite her family. \n\nThe fact that you haven't proposed even though you imply you want to is enough reason to end this relationship. \n\nStop wasting her time.", "Nta\n\nYour girlfriend doesn't appear to think it's a big deal that her SF hasn't paid you back.   You are right to think that the whole family thinks it's okay not to pay you back. That is a problem..    They've already touched you for 1k, if they were 'family', they would ask for more.\n\n  Truth is you don't want to be related to these people.  Can you imagine, first it's 'we're family', then 'do you want to see your children's grandparents....'\n\nYou should ask for the money back. If they try and say in x amount of time, say no, in stalments, so it's paid bacl 100 per month.\nIf they mes you around or get grief for getting your money back you know that's not a family you want to be tied to.", "NTA.  If you want to be petty, say something along the lines of:  'I'd love to buy a ring but I'm about $1K short.'", "I think this is a conversation to have with the father but privately. I agree this can be a bad precedent moving forward. Maybe he truly forgot - sone people really are that clueless. If he pushes back though then you know the answer. Maybe start it along the lines if \u201cI was reviewing my finances and I noticed that the loan I gave you a year ago has not been repaid\u2026\u201d Offer something like small installments if it helps. NTA.", "Nta\n\nBut I think you need to make sure you are clear on your boundaries. Even to yourself. Because in general, someone who isn't concerned with repaying a debt, even if they say they understand, will inevitably continue to borrow. Or at least try.", "NTA. I wish other people had the foresight into their relationships like this. You WILL be viewed as a source of income for her family, no question. Someone in the family passes away and there\u2019s no money for a funeral? Well, you have money, you can help! If you refuse you\u2019d be the AH. Same with nephew Timmy being out on the street because they can\u2019t afford rent. It will happen and it will get to the point where your girlfriend will side with her family and pressure you, every time. Do you really want that?", "NTA,\n\nAlthough NTA, you are avoiding taking responsibility for loaning the money and somehow putting the responsibility on your GF. \n\nIf her dad called you and asked to borrow money  and you agreed than it is you who needs to call him and ask him to start paying the money back. Be prepared to suggest a repayment plan as he may not be able to come up with a lump sum of $1000.  Maybe say something like, \u201c I wanted to talk to you about the money I loaned you last year. Are you able to start repaying me, I\u2019m ok with $50 increments etc\u2026\n\nYou are smart for being concerned about your future interactions with in-laws. I agree with other posters that you need to start talking to your HF about financial maters and seeing if your perspectives on family and money coincide!", "ESH", "NTA. You're about to become that family's wallet.", "Get where you\u2019re coming from so you need to set boundaries now. Call the $1000 a wash but make sure your GF knows this is it and you have no financial trust. Or do that awkward thing about prenups or something. Idk", "NTA. It won't stop at $1000 because \"you're family\" i.e. the family ATM if you marry into this one.", "I agree with you but I don't agree that it's about just the $1,000 loan. It's about all future money and her family possibly becoming lifetime leaches. That's enough to make anyone stop and think.\n\n*Edited for clarity.", "It\u2019s not about the amount, it\u2019s about the principle.\n\nYou don\u2019t ask to borrow something knowing damn well you won\u2019t be able to repay them.", "That's not remotely what's going on and is a really disingenuous take on the situation.\n\nIt's not about $1000 at all. It's about marrying into a family that doesn't have the integrity or respect to pay him back and having questions what that dynamic means for the future.\n\nGranted, his gf shouldn't really be part of the equation. But her family pressuring him to marry while not addressing the fact they stole money from him is absolutely relevant.", "Bingo.", "I have communicated with her. Haven\u2019t asked the father yet because of it currently being the holidays I figured now isn\u2019t the best time. I will do so once the holidays are all over.", "I had the gf ask her for me on my behalf, didn\u2019t get a clear answer. A timeline was not given.\n\nOnce the holidays are over I will ask him directly.", "Thank you for saying this because does the father even know that he still owes it? I\u2019m just saying that he might not remember - if he has ADHD for example this could be the case - and perhaps would pay right away with a reminder because it\u2019s the right thing to do, not just to get his daughter a ring. YTA OP for being so passive aggressive that you are holding up someone\u2019s life who didn\u2019t even borrow the money and maybe for not speaking to the dad directly who has no idea.", "When people say, \u201cit\u2019s not the money, it\u2019s the principle\u201d, it\u2019s usually the money.", "Separate accounts. Only one joint one for combined bills IF EVEN. My ex and I kept everything separate from the jump, and our divorce was simple signature. Idk if I had contested it, tho. I just didn\u2019t.", "Yes!", "How is it not about money? They won\u2019t be leeching his blood, they\u2019ll be leeching his money.", "You should probably talk to her about it.  As another person mentioned, whether you think about it or not, this is also about them becoming lifelong financial burdens, not just the current loan.  \n\n$1000 is a lot of money to some people but they can also view it as a small amount to someone they consider rich.  The stepfather may consider you rich enough not to need that money so he isn't considering paying you back.  But you won't find out if you don't have an uncomfortable conversation.\n\nGood luck", "You learned a $1000 lesson.\n\nWhy are you not discussing financials with your gf? You two need to know you're financially on the same page. Does she expect to help family when in need? Does she expect you to? How would she feel if you refused to give them money, because your FIL already owes you? Do you know the answers to any of these questions? Have you discussed your financial goals and how you want to achieve them with your gf? Do you know her financial goals? Have either of you ever sat down with a financial advisor? \n\nYou sound pretty proud of yourself for having money and a savings account, but you don't really come off as financially literate. Why don't you have this serious discussion with your gf and go from there? If she would be upset with you for not helping her family, then you shouldn't get engaged to her until you guys can figure out an agreement. That could be as simple as keeping your finances separate and any financial assistance her family receives comes out of her personal money, and home expenses aren't to be impacted by it.\n\nI think YTA because you're punishing your gf for something she didn't do and doesn't have any control over. You're double TA because you're not discussing your financial future with her to make sure you're compatible.", "You shouldn\u2019t lend money to friends or family unless you are willing to never be repaid. You learned a $1000 lesson. Stop making your girlfriend pay for her parents mistakes.", "But your gf didn't ask to borrow the money, the stepfather did? So you're punishing your gf for the actions of someone she isn't even related to? YTA", "You should ask the dad for the money to be repaid.", "You loaned the money to her dad; shouldn't have any bearing on when you propose.  The way to not be considered an ATM to the extended family is not to give or loan money to them. It's like you're punishing your girlfriend for literally the sins of the father...", "Simply tell them that's the last money they will get out of you and write it off. He didn't give you a concrete date for repayment from your recounting of the incident. To save yourself the aggravation, close the door on it and make sure your gf knows to never asks you for money for her family.", "I think the mistake you made was not giving an actual time limit\n\nI understand you are struggling\n\nHeres 1k until 6 months from now\n\nAnd then get it in writing", "But you obviously don't actually love her or want to marry her.", "You had a whole year at the least to bring it up to her stepdad. At this point, you\u2019re just giving excuses. Saying it\u2019s because of the holidays isn\u2019t a valid reason when you\u2019ve had a while to bring it up. I get not wanting to bring it up because you feel bad for bringing it up, but if you haven\u2019t communicated with her dad about it yet, that\u2019s on you. Your girlfriend shouldn\u2019t get the short end of the stick because you won\u2019t open your mouth to her dad.", "YUP!!!!!", "Perhaps I worded that wrong. I meant to say it's not about JUST this $1,000.  It's about all future money.", "While I understand your point of view, I think it\u2019s so ridiculous that people think just because they\u2019re family they shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay back money that was LOANED to them. \nIf there is an agreement to be paid back, it should be kept. Letting family take advantage because \u201cFaMiLy\u201d is stupid.", "Yup. I learned this lesson the hard way. Loaned FIL $4k two and a half years ago, he has paid back $500. He talks about all the events he is attending and the trip he is taking, but never mentions paying it back.", "Especially loans that are \"pay me back when you can\". That isn't a loan, there is no consideration. It is a gift that might be recirporacred one day. \n\nIf the principal matters, you set up a payment plan.", "No, it's on the gf too.  The only reason OP even considered this was the relationship via the gf; but for her, this guy is a complete stranger.  If she didn't think her stepdad was good for it, it was on her to open her mouth and tell OP not do it.\n\nOP, your point about marrying the gf includes the family is super smart.  If you're interested in this woman, tell her you're going to need that cash.  You'll learn a lot from the response.\n\nDon't marry into a family of spendthrifts, because they're going to be doing their best to get their hands on your cash.  Hell, you ain't married yet and they already started.", "They *should* be expected, and I don\u2019t condone failing to pay back loans. However, when friends and family are involved, you have no real recourse if they decide to not pay. So either don\u2019t lend, or be ready to kiss the money goodbye.", "You should stop being a doormat and mention it"]}
