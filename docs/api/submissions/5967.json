It sounds like he asked you directly and you\u2019re using his daughter as the go between. You also don\u2019t need to threaten the proposal when you ask. Just ask the man for your money back and see his response. If he doesn\u2019t/can\u2019t pay you back and that irks you so much you won\u2019t propose, break up with your girlfriend and let her be free to find someone who won\u2019t put conditions on her future.", "YTA\n\nShe can't control her family's actions anymore than you can control hers.

No question about it. \n\nHowever it\u2019s weird to me that you\u2019re bargaining a proposal over it.

Tell them it has been a  while since you loaned them the money and that you\u2019d like to work out the details of when and how they will pay you back.

Just don't help them out again in the future, and make sure your girlfriend understands why (they have clearly shown you that they can't be trusted to pay you back) and agrees with you, that her familys issues with money are their own and not your responsibility. If she is a reasonable person, this doesn't have to come between the two of you. You also marry her family to some extend, yes - But you decide where your boundries are, and if you and your girlfriend agree on these boundries, there\u2019s no reason why your future together should be dictated by her familys shortcomings when it comes to finances.\nYou probably won't see your 1000$ again, regardless of you marry her or not - Just make sure you won't be giving them more money ever again, and that this is a decision you both agree on!", "YTA - ??? So you are assuming that if you marry this woman that her family is going to see your money as their money because you loaned her dad $1k 1.5 years ago.  Dude, you are using this as a crutch.  All you have to do is say \"no\" if they ask for money.  No means no and is a complete sentence and does not need explanation.  If they come back with \"family helps family\" then shoot that down real quick by letting them know that that is manipulation and a guilt trip and won't fly.  Seriously, you said that $1k isn't even denting your savings.  Chalk it up to learning a lesson and get on with your life.

Be sure to take \"the family\" to small claims to let her know what she's missing out on.", "INFO: Have you asked him for the money back? Can he provide you with a timeline of when you can expect it?\n\nAlso, I don't think this is a good enough reason to not want to marry your partner. Honestly, I would forget about the money he owes you. It's unlikely you'll get it back. Is there a way you can legally protect your money so that once you're married she can't just give it to her parents whenever they're struggling.", "YWBTA if you try to shake her father down using your future marriage as leverage. That is a complete AH move and disrespectful to your GF. I agree he should pay you back, but it is not your GF's fault that her father doesn't keep his word. If this is the only think keeping you from marrying this woman, ask yourself this. Is your GF worth $1000 to you? If not, then don't get married. If she is, then kiss the money goodbye and move on with your life. Let it go, and consider it a lesson learned.\n\nMake sure you discuss this with your GF BEFORE you get married. Ask her what she plans on doing once you are married, if her family asks for money. Any money she gives is BOTH of your money no matter who's paycheck it comes out of, and there must be mutual agreement to give the money. Nip this in the bud. If she is not willing to agree that lending your marital money must be mutually agreed upon, then I would think twice about marrying her because this could a real problem for your marriage if she is giving away money that was supposed to go towards meeting your financial goals as a couple. Since she doesn't have a great background in money management from growing up with a family that didn't plan or budget well, make sure you have ALL the discussions about how finances will be managed in the marriage. Joint or separate accounts, spending limits, will she stay home or work when you have kids, etc.", "YWBTA. The agreement was between you and her step father and you shouldn\u2019t penalize her. A good rule of thumb is never loan money you wouldn\u2019t freely give, because there\u2019s a good chance that it will end up a gift anyway. Legally, you aren\u2019t tied to these people, and if you marry, you\u2019ll only legally be connected with your wife.

Look who is punishing a woman for the mistakes of men? \n\nThat would be you.  This was an agreement between two men, though, right?   And, I highly doubt you truly love her if you are holding your relationship over her stepfather\u2019s head.  1k without a written and signed agreement?  That\u2019s your stupid tax, bro.\n\nAlso, you need to have a serious talk with your would-be fianc\u00e9e about how the Bank of OP is now closed to her family, and you will never again agree to give or loan them money from your private and/or combined accounts. \n\nYTA.

Even if the father pays back this time, who says it won\u2019t happen again once you\u2019re married to your GF? \n\nEven if you say no to them in the future, your GF could start lending money behind your back to avoid any future confrontations.

Giant. First, the ick factor here ... you won't marry a woman you claim to love unless you get your 1k back ... is high. Second, every grown up in the world should know this ... if you can't afford to lose the money, don't lend the money. Consider every loan as a big \"bye-bye\" to your cash. All you have to do at this point is tell the family that this was your one and only financial gift, then get on with your life with the woman you claim to love. However, if I were she, I'd bounce out of this relationship.", "NTA.  Eighteen months is more than enough time to start paying someone back.\n\n Nicely, ask for the money back.

Once you get engaged, I think there is little chance of you seeing the money.", "NTA but proceed with caution. Can you trust her to not give them money once your money becomes y\u2019all\u2019s money? When you marry someone, you get stuck with the family. Is this going to become a big enough problem where you\u2019re going to have to cut her parents out at some point and how is she going to react if that happens? I would tell the dad you need your money back and he firm. You might need to accept that you will never see the money again, can you get over that?

You alone determine whether or not these people \"leech money off of you.\" To do it all you have to say is no. And while we're talking about lending money to family, it's a good time to accept that you just shouldn't lend money to family (or anyone you want to maintain a close relationship with) that you can't afford to give away. Why? Because they might not pay you back and you want to avoid situations like this. \n\nYou and your gf need to be on the same page 100% about lending or giving money to her family.

It's gone. \n\nTalk to the girlfriend. Let her know that going forward you won't be willing to provide financial support to her family. How does she react to this? What is her expectation on supporting her family? Is she going to be handing over all her cash without talking to you and expecting you to pick up the slack at home? You two need to have a conversation about finances and how that looks in the future when you're married.", "ESH. Step dad should have paid you back. You should have asked him for the money yourself. As for not marrying your girlfriend because her step dad owes you money? If I were your girlfriend, I would take that as a sign that you didn\u2019t really want to marry me. My view is that people who want to do things, like get married, find a way to make them happen. People who don\u2019t want to do things find reasons to not do them.  The best interpretation of your position is that you & your girlfriend need to have some serious conversations about how you will handle money during your marriage. Suggest you do that instead of making this debt a hill to die on.", "Just to be clear you are refusing to move forward in a relationship with a woman you claim to love because of unpaid $1000 loan? $1000?

Talk to the girlfriend about how to handle this and future parent cash flow issues.", "Yeah, and YTA here\u2019s why:\n\nYou are putting separate relationships into the middle of your relationship with the your GF.\nYou\u2019re essentially blaming her for her step fathers actions. \n\nAlso you agreed to be paid back when they were able to - have their circumstances changed that would enable them to pay you back now? You put the repayment on their terms not yours.\n\nYou lent money to people whom you know to be financially irresponsible - again  are placing that on your GF rather than a decision you made. She may be the reason you have a relationship with her family but she is not responsible for them or for you lending them money (unless she pressured you into it which would make it her responsibility too).\n\nYou do need to have a conversation with her about money etc including any future hypothetical loans to anyone (is that something you do from your own personal account, shared accounts etc) and wethers it\u2019s a hard no regardless of who\u2019s asking or something you agree as a couple (and get it plus repayment terms in writing). \n\nYou don\u2019t sound ready for marriage, which is totally fine. \n\nYou don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re going to be with this person if $1,000 (which you yourself say is no big deal to you) is what\u2019s keeping you from proposing. In effect something that doesn\u2019t mean much to you (and was worth someone else) is more important to you than your GF.\n\nand again she\u2019s not the person you lent money to, someone else is.\n\nAlso do you really not hear yourself? Pay me money or I won\u2019t marry your daughter. It Doesn\u2019t really matter that it was repayment of a loan, that makes you really really shitty.", "How about $2000?", "Depends on where you are. If OP is from a country with a weak currency 1000$ is a lot.", "Not only that, but a huge lesson in lending money to family. It doesn't work the majority of the time. You are better saying no, or considering it a gift. \n\nOP is obviously still capable of saying no. \n\nSome of us come from dysfunctional families. I am one of them. I would 100% understand someone saying they aren't up for that.  What isn't cool is stringing along the other person. You didnt loan them 1000, but chose to loan their family member. The $1000 is nonsense and an excuse. You have said no to further loans, you have said no to marriage. Either accept that loss or move on. What is happening is a wishy washy idk. If I'm repaid - it's cool, if not repaid - I'll hang out here without a commitment.", "You shouldn't need to be asked to give borrowed money back.

She didn't ask him to do so", "He's the one loaning money not her", "Did her father asked you for the money through her? Because if he communicated with you directly, I don't see why you are involving her now.", "Yep. Because he doesn\u2019t have to give anymore money but she will. It\u2019s not bad to support your family but there is a difference between supporting and enabling and setting yourself on fire to keep others warm.", "You need to have a long hard talk with your gf.   If she is the one you want to spend your life with.  She needs to understand that part of the agreement is that you or her will not be loaning her family money.  That her family will NOT be moving in with you.  Then you need to talk to her parents and tell them the same.  Nicely of coarse.  Tell them that all parents should want better for their children.  That you are concerned with their financial situation being your burden and you want to make it clear that you will not.  Your responsibility will be to care for their daughter and future children only.  Then make finances open so that she doesn't feel you are micromanaging her about money.  Agree on how to spend money.  Let her have some control.   Don't let money be a control thing.

Whether he is married or not", "that could be cleared up by talking with his girlfriend about his concerns and what her expectations are of him in terms of support?

Yup it really sounds like this is all about how much he cares about her.", "Yeah he's setting a BOUNDARY \\*within\\* his relationship to deal with an issue thats external to his relationship.

It\u2019s a $1000, in the big scheme of things it\u2019s petty cash. Next time they ask a simple \u201cno\u201d will suffice. It\u2019s not like they are just going to whisk cash out of your pocket.

Wow", "Just admit that you don't really want to marry her & let her go. YTA because you wouldn't need to use a petty excuse if you truly wanted to marry her. Instead you could have an adult conversation where you make it clear where you stand on her family & money. \n\nYou chose to make this loan & not her. Now you're just using it as an excuse to not marry her. You can say otherwise, but this comment makes it clear that is the truth.", "This, to me, is a crucial question. Did she know? Did she offer encouragement? A warning? Did she realize she\u2019d be made a go-between?", "The key thing you're missing here is they asked for a LOAN. Meaning it's expected to be paid back. You don't borrow a friend or family member's car and then just not return it do you? The fact that the object in this instance is money doesn't make a difference. He stated it's not about the amount of money it's about the principle because he doesn't want to be seen as an ATM. \n\nHe spoke with the girlfriend because he needs to know where she is going to stand on this issue. I don't blame him, because what if he went straight to step dad and he got angry and blew up the whole thing to make the girlfriend uncomfortable too and feel like she needs to leave him or has to cut off her family?

I still think OP is NTA, but they are learning a hard lesson about financial boundaries and trust. There will be countless more conversations about money with the GF and potentially her family too.\n\nIt is clear that OP is questioning the trust in his relationship, and it can be a difficult conversation to have.\n\nSo what's holding OP back from an engagement isn't just the $1000, it's their worry over whether or not they can enter a lifelong commitment when there's lack of trust about financial matters.", "Well, you think wrongly, because now it's $1000, but tomorrow's gonna be 10 000 because \"we're family, and family helps each other\"\n\nthe type of people that do not return what they owe to others are the people that love using them, especially with the \"we're a family\" excuse\n\nNTA, OP, it's understandable you want to make sure you're not used for your HARD EARNED money.

You cant imagine building a new family, if you are pressured into giving away your money to your partners family, or being seen as the bad guy.\n\nI didnt marry my MIL, but yet i was the one having to pay off her debt, that for some legal reason was redirected to my husband. They are both working on paying me back, were pretty embarrassed to have to turn to me at all, and know damn well it was a one in a freaking lifetime deal (way more than 1k). I did it because it was going to impact my own household for the rest of our lives, since my husband was not having enough savings to pay it off at once. We discussed it and i decided it was best for the both of us like this, but i know no one wouldve hold me a grudge if i said no.\n\nNow if my husband (and his family) was thinking it was totally OK to expect from me to spend the money i started saving at 15, just so his family members can live above their paygrade, this marriage couldnt work. Of course it will be up to me to accept or refuse, but either i'll be bitter all my life to see my money vanished away, or i'll be pointed to as the bad guy and guilt-tripped by my husband at all time. it just cant work. \n\nOP needs to established boundaries that everyone agrees to (expecially his GF), before considering *legally bounding himself into the family*. wether the 1000$ are paid back or not.", "My rule is simple now - never lend to friends or family; if they are in need and you can afford to, gift it.

If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t marry her.\n\nHe has tried to establish boundaries before and she won\u2019t take him seriously. This little crusade is not going to fix this issue. And based on all his comments, he barely even seems to like his GF anyway.\n\nThis is nothing but an ego trip, and the argument that he is trying to set himself up to be in a financially healthy relationship is ridiculous because he\u2019s not doing anything that is going to realistically achieve it, and he\u2019s the one who set the precedent for loaning money informally in the first place.\n\nIn my opinion, OP behaved like an idiot when he loaned the money, and he\u2019s an idiot if he thinks this convo with dad is going to fix his issues with his gf.", "Best advice to be honest.", "We have no idea if she even knows about it. It doesnt sound like OP consulted her before lending the money.", "Yeah, I also picked up on the weird age gap. \n\nIf he became financially secure at 21 (very unlikely - I would be estimating early 30s without fairly significant parental support but let\u2019s say he managed to find really good job) he would now be 31. \n\nIf she is in her mid 20s then 25 would be a decent guess. Again could be a bit older or a bit younger but that seems fair. \n\n6 years isn\u2019t huge in terms of age gaps, but if they have been dating for 4 years then he would be around 27 when he started dating a 21 year old. And that\u2019s being pretty generous - it\u2019s reads like he was a fair bit older. \n\nWhile his girlfriend could also have been financially stable at 21 but that seems very unlikely, especially as she comes from a family with money problems and because it doesn\u2019t sound like her family have been asking her for money (?) \n\nSo it\u2019s not just an age gap, it\u2019s an age gap and financial disparity. And that he is holding this over her head, rather than just discussing how they will handle their joint finances together in the future? \n\nNot TA for wanting the money back, but not as upstanding as he is trying to present himself either.", "Yeah once he said \u201cbetter half of a decade\u201d I wondered how old he is.

He leant money to someone that he didn't know well enough.  Why?  Honestly if I was his GF, I'd be more worried about how finanically savvy he is, rather than the other way around.", "Absolutely. Always get it in writing and make it official.", "Yes, that would be the adult and financially literate approach. Not qualities OP is demonstrating much skill in though.", "Yeah but she didnt loan her family any money, he did.

He needs to figure out how GF and future FIL handles the situation before he marries... otherwise it is obviously a huge risk he is taking. He must know that the person he intends marrying will have his back, even if that means fraction with her own family. I want to marry a person who would have my back above everything else, who lives by the same values as I do.\nFor me it doesn't sound like OP is worried about the $1000, it sounds like he wants to know how the matter will be handled, as this is a good indication of how all future similar matters may be handled.", "Ok but that's a reason to have an adult conversation with his gf about their future money habits and boundaries instead of dragging it out for years without telling anyone how you really feel and simmering on the inside over $1000 from over a year ago.
