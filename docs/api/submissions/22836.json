With new tools and, well, everything else going on at reddit we\u2019ve adjusted our criteria a bit, so we welcome all applicants.\n\n[Click this magic link to apply](https://forms.gle/M7i7hSF9iUUkHkqm9)\n\n# What does moderating r/AmITheAsshole entail?\n\nMost of what we do, you see! We act on every report, reply to modmail, write all of the rules, FAQs, and every other message you see. We also write posts, build custom bots and tools, and otherwise come up with more ways to moderate the community. As a team, we\u2019re responsible for this entire community and everything that goes on here. This can also involve working with reddit to improve the site - or more recently advocating that reddit do better for our community.   \nOr to put it simply: we do everything needed to ensure the community continues to meet the purpose u/flignir created it for.\n\n# Answering some common questions.\n\n* **We mod** ***mostly*** **from desktop**, and that\u2019s the way you\u2019ll need to complete your training. Modding from mobile is now possible, but isn\u2019t quite as efficient as from desktop. Hopefully in the coming months it gets even easier.\n* We\u2019re looking for adults (must be 18 or over).\n* We\u2019re happy to take applicants from any time zone, and availability during US overnight hours is especially needed.\n* You mod when you want! There is no requirement that you must mod x number of hours per day or anything. Some of us are on a good chunk of the day, others pop in when they want/can - it\u2019s entirely up to you!\n* You don\u2019t have to be an expert on the rules. Some of them are pretty simple. Others have a good degree of nuance and we often bounce questions off each other. Demonstrating a good understanding of the rules as a whole is essential, but don\u2019t worry about having the right answer every time.\n* Modding from an alternate account is allowed! You\u2019ll have the opportunity to let us know your alt after your application is reviewed.  \n\n\nPlease ask other questions about applying or being a mod below!

Thank you", "What would you say is the weekly time commitment for modding here?", "Can you give an example of the type of posts a moderator would write?", "Some mods spend hours a day (it\u2019s a nice way to spend the time in a meeting that should have been an email). Some might spend a half hour a week, in little 5 minute increments here and there. And all in between.\n\nWe all do this because we want to, and we never want someone to feel like they *need* to mod.", "According to the post,\n\n> You mod when you want!

[Here is a collection of posts for the monthly open forums](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbqapd/aita_monthly_open_forum_december_2022/) that we write - often collaboratively too.

Most posts that come from a mod in the sub are things we\u2019ve worked together on in some way.

Thanks", "Volunteer.  \n\nAnd you get paid in trash talk about you in the comments section sometimes if you're really lucky."]}
