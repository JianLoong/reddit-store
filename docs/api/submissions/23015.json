He is acting as if you are borrowing his things, when it is the other way around.", "NTA\n\nCalmly let him know that while you were happy to share, now you would like more usage of your own property so that he will need to get his own.

If he needs the tablet to do his job, surely he can afford to buy his own.", "NTA. It belongs to you, therefore you get first dibs. Keep it locked up.

A good cause to insult someone?

Do you have any good hiding places, and a nice secure case to keep the tablet from being damaged if the container is thrown around? Based on your comments, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he tried to steal or break the tablet when you tell him no. I know how expensive a nice Wacom can be and it\u2019d be a shame for you to lose *your* art supplies to your brother\u2019s shitty attitude. Your instinct to stop lending the tablet is right and justified, but it will probably piss him off and you should prepare to defend your property from fuckery. \n\nAre your parents around? Can you get them to help? I don\u2019t know what your family dynamic is like, so this might not be the most helpful, but if you think they might take your side it could be worth asking them to intervene.\n\nIf your parents refuse to tell him no, you could \u201csuggest\u201d that since your brother likes the tablet so much, they could get him his own refurbished tablet for his birthday or an upcoming holiday. If he has his own item, he wouldn\u2019t need to be a dick and take yours. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be rewarded for his shitty attitude in the slightest, so this is not a \u201cjustice\u201d outcome, but it\u2019s pragmatic in that it *would* probably get him to leave your stuff alone. (*You* don\u2019t owe him shit, don\u2019t buy him shit, this is a last-case if you can\u2019t get him off your back.

I strongly advise you to NOT lend your tablet or property to him any longer, and suggest to him that he save up his money and get a tablet himself.   \n\n\nWhile this may cause a small fight and some tension, it's clear that your brother doesn't respect you or your things, so again, back to the first section I wrote, I strongly advise you to NOT lend him anything else.", "NTA\n\nHe seems like he\u2019s the type who punches holes into drywall.", "NTA.
