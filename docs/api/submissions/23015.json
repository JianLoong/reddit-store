Time for you to take back your property and time for him to take some of the money he\u2019s earned and buy his own.", "NTA\n\nIt is your property. Your brother is very entitled. Don't lend him anything anymore, because he certainly isn't grateful.", "Since he needs one regularly, he needs to buy his own. NTA.  Stop letting him use it, period.", "NTA.  He is acting as if you are borrowing his things, when it is the other way around.", "NTA\n\nCalmly let him know that while you were happy to share, now you would like more usage of your own property so that he will need to get his own. Give a week or two to purchase his own and let him know in the mean time you expect him to return it after each use and collect it before his classes. He is the one borrowing it, the onus is on him to facilitate the exchange.", "NTA. \n\nHow your brother behaves is completely unacceptable. If he needs the tablet to do his job, surely he can afford to buy his own.", "NTA. It belongs to you, therefore you get first dibs. Keep it locked up. He's infantile, selfish, tight-fisted, petty, childish and entitled. If it's so important for the quality of his lessons he should act like an adult and buy his own, he's like a 6 year old having a tantrum because you want your ball back.", "NTA. FAFO.", "NTA. He should learn that if he doesn\u2019t treat you with respect, he doesn\u2019t get to use your stuff. Sounds like people have been enabling him for too long. If he\u2019s prone to violence then be sure to keep yourself safe. If your parents are around (and are good parents) it could be worth letting them know. This kind of aggressive behavior is not good", "NTA\n\nIf someone treated me like this after I did them a favor, I'd stop doing favors for them.", "NTA for wanting to keep your stuff. YTA for not giving him enough warning that he could get his own in time for his next class. The correct thing would to say hey bro, I\u2019m going to need to keep my tablet so I can do my stuff. So you need to get one for yourself ordered. I can let you borrow it until next week, then you should probably have a replacement for yourself.", "\"I also don't want us to fight over things and cause tension so I feel like taking back the tablet so I can use it whenever I want without a fight.\"\n\nYTA. I don't approve of you repossessing something he needs for his online teaching without either a conversation, or a static routine, so in the moment I think he had every right to be angry and good cause to yell at and insult you. Nowhere in your post is there any indication your brother has been unreasonable or abusive about the tablet in the past.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
