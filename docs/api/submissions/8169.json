Its not your responsibility, you even said he shouldnt do it", "NTA - your dad doesn't have the right to drop parental expectations on your shoulders.

I\u2019d have said NAH until your dad\u2019s reaction. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong by adopting a baby, or by being Tyler\u2019s dad. But you didn\u2019t adopt a child, and you didn\u2019t sign up for taking custody of one just because he did. He\u2019s being unreasonable to expect you to change everything about your life to take on that responsibility if something happens to him.", "Easily NTA\n\nThe 8 year old is your father\u2019s responsibility since your father adopted him. \n\nYou didn\u2019t adopt anyone, so the responsibility is not yours\u2026.simple.", "NTA. Not your kid, not your responsibility.", "NAH\n\nYour dad is 42, he's not 78! At 42 people are still birthing children. He isn't an asshole because he chose to adopt. Sounds like he enjoys being a father. Showering with an 8 year old is weird but sleeping with an 8 year old, nothing wrong with that.\n\nYou're not an asshole either. You shouldn't feel obligated to take care of \"Tyler\" because he isn't your responsibility and you're still really young. Choosing to be a parent is hard work. No matter what age you are. Its especailly hard when you're so young and trying to find your own way.", "NTA.\n\nIt looks like your dad did the right thing by waiting until you were around the age of adulthood to start taking in foster kids if you were not on board with the idea. It would have been an asshole move to take foster kids into a home when he had responsibility for a minor who could have been hostile. \n\nBut he's being an asshole now by getting mad at you because he assumed you'd suddenly be on board to become a parental figure if something happened to him when you weren't even on board with him fostering in the first place. You're at an age where I think it would be reasonable for you not to be prepared to become a parent figure to biological siblings either if something happened to your dad, so this isn't even just about adoption.\n\nHowever, the situation might be less acrimonious if you stopped insisting the issue is that he adopted in the first place. Your father had every right to do that while you were an adult. It's selfish to expect him to not take in other kids who need a home because you want his life to stay exactly the same while you go on to adulthood. Your father isn't wrong for the adoption, he's wrong for trying to make you a potential parent without his consent. He might be less hurt too if you frame it that way. \n\nSaying the adoption is the problem turns this from a conflict over what your actions would be in a hypothetical situation, into a conflict over how both you and his adopted son fit into his life, which I don't think is what you intended based on how you said you would still want a brotherly relationship with Tyler if your father passed.", "42 is not old. People have kids all the time in their 40s. But NTA. If you don't want that resonability then that should be that. He should not hold that against you. A lot of people have no interest in raising kids and that's perfectly alright.", "What country is this in?", "NTA.  You are not obligated to raise someone else's child.", "Your dad is the selfish one. Adoption should be about the child. He unilaterally decided to adopt a child without considering back up. He is doing a bang up job with the child as well. His lack of planning is not your emergency. NTA.", "NTA, though your dad made a mistake by adopting a baby and using that child as a surrogate for a relationship. At his age to still be sleeping and showering together ... eww. \n\nMaybe your dad got some concerning health news, or he's just awkward. He needs to get over it and start doing a better job of raising Tyler to be a functional kid as he is getting closer to the teen years. Your dad should also look to date and find a romantic partner.", "NTA \n\nYour father chose to adopt a child when he was somewhat older. That's on him. When you have a child that you are responsible for, especially as a single parent, you need to consider that child's future should something happen to you. That includes illness, disability, or death. Your father didn't consider any of that.he just assumed you would take over. Then he insulted you further by waving money in your face. He is disgusting. \n\nYou have the right to refuse to take on the responsibility of another human, even if you love that human.", "His mom gave birth and then \u201cran out of the hospital?\u201d\n\nI think you need to work on your story telling a little bit.", "This is a tough one. I'm going with ESH.\n\nFirst: your perspective on your dad being too old and too single to be a parent seems very, very skewed by your own youth and possibly some internalized sexism. Lots of people don't have kids until their 40s. (My husband was 43 when our son was born.) But you also seem to object to the fact that your father is raising Tyler alone. Lots of people raise children on their own, and there is no reason that a single dad is less capable than a single mom. Your dad wanted more children, and he was right: he did not need a partner to do it.  I have to ask whether you'd feel the same way (regarding single parenthood) if it had been a single woman adopting a child. Telling your dad he should not have adopted was cruel, both to your dad and to your brother, and you seem to be letting your own discomfort with your dad becoming a single parent affect your perspective.\n\nThe fact that Tyler still showers with your dad at age 8 is definitely unusual. Still sleeping in your dad's bed is a little less unusual; lots of kids at that age are still fearful. In addition Tyler--as a former foster child who was adopted--may have some trauma that you're not aware of. But unless you have reason to suspect there's abuse going on, it's not your business.\n\nBut: you are not obligated to agree to become Tyler's guardian if something happens to him, and it was wrong of your dad to assume you would be and to guilt you for refusing. Your dad is right that it is unlikely that anything will happen to him while Tyler is still a minor, but the reason parents make these arrangements is because something MIGHT. And before you agree to such an arrangement, you should absolutely consider whether you're ready and willing to care for a child, whether your life circumstances would allow it, and whether you would be a good parent to your traumatized brother.", "ESH, you can absolutely decline and don\u2019t have to be a carer. On the other hand you are now 27, and your father does have another son who is a child you seem hostile too. It makes sense he would withdraw to protect the more vulnerable person.", "The correct response everyone misses is \n\n\"I will do my best to make sure he is raised well, supported, and taken care of\"\n\nNothing in this statement ensures the one who said it will be doing the raising and it gives the other person peace of mind.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut if something does end up happening to your dad and Tyler has to go into foster care, he will 100% think YTA. Whether or not that matters is up to you. I don't know how close you two are.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
