You cannot just decide to foster a child as it is a lot more work than he may think. I worked with a family who was similar (husband was a doctor and the wife stayed at home). They had money, adult children, and took in the most calm child I ever had. They were awful to work with because they wanted things done *yesterday*. The foster care system does not work like that. \n\nI would suggest having him work in a mentorship program that works with foster children or other kids in need.

It\u2019s a full commitment to a child and their family, and if you aren\u2019t in a place to make that commitment for any reason then don\u2019t. You\u2019d be doing a disservice to a child if you started fostering due to pressure from your spouse, or for basically any reason other than a personal and deep desire to foster. \n\nIf foster care is really the thing he wants to be involved in, then maybe respite care is something you could explore together. Respite is always needed, and you could do it entirely on your own schedule with minimal disruption to your life outside of that.
