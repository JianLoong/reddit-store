Kids who end up in foster care don't get there by having a healthy childhood. They have trauma, and trauma usually doesn't come out in pretty ways in children.

A foster child is a person with needs and a personality of their own!  People should not foster a child unless they sre all in.   You are not interested, and that is okay.   Tell your husband that it won't improve a child's life to be in a home where it is not wanted, and you don't want another child.", "NTA. He is delusional.", "No, don\u2019t do it remember this saying no good deed goes unpunished", "If you don't want to do it, please don't the child will feel the rejection even if you try to hide it.  I think if he wans to help he can look for charity orgs like Big Brother and sponsor a child himself.   And the fact he wants it beause he is 'bored' is a bit of a red flag. Kids aren't there to fill your empty time and entertain you.  Maybe he can get a dog instead?", "He should apply to Big Brother", "NTA You would be TA if you agreed to go along with it without being fully on board. Putting a child that's in a vulnerable place in a home where both parents aren't 100% committed is only going to cause further trauma.\n\nThere's so many ways he can help,, he could be a big brother to a child, or volunteer with Make a wish to help make children's dreams come true. There is probably even a way he can volunteer to work with kids in care without the commitment to fostering. They always need respite homes, if that's something you were okay with doing. For example, if a foster family is going on a vacation where they aren't able/allowed to take the child along, they would need another home for them to stay at for a predetermined amount of time. Again, lots of good options where he could really make a difference.", "As a child of the foster system, NTA. I appreciate that you accept you are not ready for the burden of dealing with a traumatised child. And it is/can be a burden, because as you said it isn't easy to know what the child had been through. Their specific traumas could be unprocessed, chock full of hair triggers, or even completely repressed to the point that when they \"break\" or have a meltdown they won't even know why. I agree that if your husband is looking for that nurturing that comes with a child he should look elsewhere. A foster child is not an accessory, it's a commitment.", "OP--NTA.  \n\nMy mum was a foster child and she said that she was very, very lucky--she was placed with a family that wanted her, worked on making sure she had an education, etc.  The most important thing for my mum was the stability they gave her. She wasn't shuttled between families. One family that wanted her. \n\nIf you know 100% you do not want to do this, do not let yourself be worn down by your husband. Kids aren't stupid, they can sense if you want them around you or not.  \n\nIf your husband feels the need to make a positive change in a child's life, there's Big Brothers.", "NTA. Get your own space and live your life! If hubby still wants to foster, let him. By himself! \u270c\ud83c\udffe", "NTA. You raised two kids. You did your part. You get to enjoy yourself now. Like you said- he can get a job or volunteer helping children.", "NTA. Your husband actually sounds very selfish. If he's bored he needs to find a hobby. Raising children, particularly fostering children with trauma, is not a panacea for his boredom. \n\nIf he wants to make a difference in the world he could do a lot on his own, rather than placing additional emotional burden in his wife and any foster child.", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to not want another child, foster or not.", "He's BORED so he wants a kid?!?? Tell him a kid is not a hobby. NTA.", "NTA - he is only remembering the 'fun' times OR he was only around for the 'fun' times & never did the work", "NTA and do not do it. This can't be a decision made only to pleasure someone.", "NTA\n\nThere are plenty of other mentor programs that don't involve bringing a child into your house. In the state the most well known is Big Brothers/Big Sisters of course but I'm sure there are statewide or even county/city wide mentor programs that he can look into. I think that is a much better route for you guys. And if you are not American I'm sure there are similar programs to look into!", "He\u2019s \u201cbored\u201d\u2026. \ud83d\ude33 get him a dang puppy!!!", "I was hoping someone who was a foster parent would chime in. As a former foster parent myself, this is 100% accurate, especially in regard to dealing with trauma and attachment focused parenting. It's a different world than traditional parenting, and you both have to be 100% committed - both for your sake, but also the child's/children's sake.\n\nTell your husband to focus his energy in other places that can still help foster kids. You don't have to be a foster parent to make a difference.", "Having a soft spot for foster kids is exactly why the vote on this should be NTA.", "Wow. This needed to be mentioned. It's definitely not all sunshine and butterflies...... \ud83c\udf3f Edit to add additional thoughts. No matter how good your intentions to make a difference, some kids are honestly broken beyond repair.", "Tell him \u201ca foster child deserves two parents who are excited to raise them. Having a parent who has to be convinced to have them will only be detrimental.\u201d Anyway, if both of you aren\u2019t fully on board ya\u2019ll are unlikely to get approved to foster anyway.", "Honestly he just sounds bored and empty-nested. Also, he doesn't seem to grasp what fostering actually entails.", "Perhaps he can join the Big Brother program since that's the limit of his attention span on kids.", "This made me laugh too. Like - Ew! Who wants that when they\u2019re ready to retire!!?? Fuck no! That\u2019s exactly WHY she doesn\u2019t want it!!! He\u2019s trying to sell her a job as if she doesn\u2019t know what it entails. And clearly HE doesn\u2019t know what it entails which is why he\u2019s so eager to sign her up for it. What an AH.", "I was going to suggest Big Brothers/Big Sisters. Adopt a Grandparent sounds like a great alternative and a way to dip his toes into the water without all out committing to full time care.", "Agreed.  It seems like he doesn't really understand what goes into raising a child.  Having fun and playing with a child is important, but there is so much more to it than that. .", "I had the same issue with my ex-husband.  We had two dogs and so much of their care landed on me.  The one time he tried to discipline one of the them, we put him in the coat closet when he ran down the street to pee and didn't stay in our front yard.  I knew there was no way I could raise a child with a man who thought this was appropriate punishment and would leave me with all the work and probably comment on how I'm doing it wrong.", "Emergency fostering is a thing so is respite fostering which is where you \u201cbabysit\u201d a foster kid so their foster parents can have a break or go to a funeral out of state or go on a vacation or whatever.  It\u2019s usually just for a few days at a time, the state pays you and the foster parents will often go overboard to make sure the kid has everything they need.", "I'm wondering how much of this has to do with the change in dynamic at home.  While the kids were at home, OP's life was probably pretty circumscribed between her day job, kids, and house.  Now she has free time for new interests and can do more of what interests her.  I'm wondering if her husband finds that uncomfortable or even resents it, consciously or not.\n\nHaving a foster would restore the previous dynamic - OP would be locked down again *and* he would get to feel like a good guy who is nobly fostering a kid.  Win-win for him, except not for OP.", "Right!? Emergency foster care usually involves a child that had some sort of traumatic event just happen. Using them to prove he can't hack it is cruel to the already traumatized child. Not that that's appropriate for any child but it just makes it an even worse idea.", "I was wondering about that, too.  He liked things the way they were, with his wife either working or at home with the kids.  Now, she's changing and blossoming and he might not like it.", "I mean she basically did \ud83d\ude04"]}
