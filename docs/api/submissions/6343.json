If he wanted to get divorced and foster a child himself, that would be his right. But it's not right for him to pressure you to fostering a child you don't want.\n\nEnjoy having an empty nest!", "As someone who was in foster home then adopted, NTA. Fostering a kid isn't just because you are bored. It's a lot of emotional labor. And foster kids are more hyper aware than most when they aren't wanted. It wouldnt help them and you would probably resent being pressured into doing it when you already stated you dont want to! NTA, hope this feedback helps", "NTA. Not fair to the kid who had already experienced trauma to be placed in a home with a caregiver who doesn't want them there. You are being honest about how you are feeling.

There are many programs he can get involved with that will allow him to make a difference without fostering.\n\nOr... try a puppy lol", "NTA! Fostering a child is a big commitment! You saw how much your cousin struggled. Both you and your husband need to be willing to take in a child.

The compassionate thing to do is to not have the child.", "NTA so very NTA", "NTA being a foster parent is not for everyone. If it\u2019s not in your heart please don\u2019t do it. Foster children have enough to go through.", "NTA \n\nJust because you can doesn't mean you should.  Your husband currently is not adjusting as well as you with the empty nest and he needs to figure it out for himself somewhat.  Filling that space with a troubled child that you are not 100 percent on board with won't fix his problems and you shouldn't feel any guilt for not wanting the same thing.", "NTA being a foster parent is no joke, you both have to 100% be on board.

Has he spoken to other foster parents, kids etc. I get the impression that he thinks that it\u2019s going to picnics and butterflies when it\u2019s a lot of hard work.", "NTA, that is a huge responsibility. Can't you guys get a hobby together? Learn to play pickleball or hike or something.", "I was a foster child, nta, it must be a unanimous decision because it's not easy.  I went to meet my foster parents 35 years after the state decided to take us away in favor of our grandparents. They were left devastated.", "NTA.  You and your husband have radically different views on how to your time and money are to be consumed.  This is a radical difference.  He will complain and blame you for denying him the opportunity to be fun adult while forcing you to be responsible parent.  On your time.  On your fine.  He is unlikely to give this up.  It\u2019s a hill he\u2019s willing to die on.   It may be time to protect your financial stability and your time by divorce.  Set him free.", "NTA but I would be willing to bet that he has a kid with someone else that he wants to slide in and take as a 'foster' and/or he is going to do this come hell or high water, so you probably might want to look into counseling to discuss. \n\nOr maybe we all read too many similar stories here with these types of predictable reasons/outcomes.", " Nope. Fostering is incredibly stressful and you both have to be 100% in. He has rose colored glasses. It\u2019s so so much work and paperwork and people breathing down your neck. I promise it is not like having a kid again.", "NTA. Foster care is not for everyone. It's a lot of work to get licensed not to mention the intrusiveness of inspections. Plus, the children are suffering some sort of trauma and will almost always have special needs. On top of that, there will be visitations and the biological parents might take out their frustrations on you; not to mention the case workers are overworked and some are controlling AH. \n\nThis is not to say it isn't rewarding. It is something that requires serious commitment and should not be done on a whim.", "NTA  \n\n\nThis situation requires two people to say yes, but only one person to say no.\n\nYou've stated your position.

The only reason to bring a child into your life is because everyone involved actively wants to raise a child. You do not, and you will end up resenting this foster kid, which will be terrible for the mental health of a child who is probably already going through a lot.

Choosing to be a foster parent means showing up all day every day for someone else's kid.  That child may have been exposed to trauma going into foster care and was likely traumatized by having to go into care and be in care.  I say \"someone else's kid\" because they're experiencing the limbo of not knowing if their parents rights will be terminated, if they'll be adopted, if they'll return home etc.  Foster kids are NOT toys.

I was in the system for 8 years, and was in 12 homes and 3 shelters.

It only causes more emotional damage to be placed in another home where you aren't wanted.", "This. NTA because husband really needs to think this through from her perspective at their age and place in life. He's got a good heart, but she's raised all the kids she has the energy to raise.", "> He argues it will be like having a child again \n\nExplain that this is exactly why you don't want that. He wasn't helpful the first time around and you did the vast majority of the actual parenting while he was only ever present for the precious little time when his work allowed him to be there, and that you have no interests in this arrangement for a third time.", "This is why I don\u2019t want kids with my husband. We have two small dogs, and I do 99% of the care.", "I don't think it's 'we' as in 'we have two small dogs'. You should tell your husband 'I have two small dogs, and you sometimes play with them'."]}
