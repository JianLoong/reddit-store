You cannot just decide to foster a child as it is a lot more work than he may think. I worked with a family who was similar (husband was a doctor and the wife stayed at home).

It\u2019s a full commitment to a child and their family, and if you aren\u2019t in a place to make that commitment for any reason then don\u2019t.
