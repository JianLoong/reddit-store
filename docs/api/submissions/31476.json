So for 16 of your 42 years, you've shared your ex's surname. And it's the same surname you share with your child. I'm at a loss to see why your current partner has an issue, other than his own insecurities. If you cave on your name (your identity), thr goal post will just move to appease his issues. If this is a hill for him to die on, then that's *his* hill and he can stay there.", "NTA he has no say in your name. This is his insecurity speaking up. It's ok to kiss a few rebound frogs before you find your prince.\n\nETA: my mom kept the name after divorce, and it caused no problems with her partner after.", "NTA. In my opinion there's nothing wrong with keeping the last name especially since there's a kid involved. Wanting to have the same name as your kid makes all the sense in the world to me even for just convenience sake. Plus the fact you don't even want to remarry.\n\nI don't think your current partner should see you keeping the name as an indication that you want them back or something.", "NTA, \n\nOk, my mom never took my dad's name. I took my dad's last name when I was born.  When my mom and I traveled alone together, we would always be stopped because of the different last names, especially when at boarder control. \n\nOne time, we got stopped and had to wait 3 HOURS in an airport so they could prove that my mom wasn't kidnapping me. I was only a year or two older then your son at the time, so age didn't play a factor in it.\n\n Tell your boyfriend that your wanting to keep the name because it'll just make things smoother when your traveling, filling out documents, etc.", "NTA. Your name is your choice and your reason is valid. The fact that you want to share a last name with your kid is great. Not to mention the hassle to do all the paperwork to reclaim your maiden name in official papers. You don\u2019t own anyone an explanation about your choice, let alone a person you\u2019re not planning to marry.", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR name. Maybe not the one you were born with, but, it\u2019s most certainly yours.  Your response was more than sufficient.  If this is an issue for him, then, it\u2019s a him problem. If he wants to make a deal out of it, then he\u2019s shown you who he is.  Believe him, and act accordingly (by that, I mean say bye to a jealous and controlling individual- ain\u2019t no one have time for that noise).", "NTA. It\u2019s annoying to change a name, I\u2019m sure you learned when you changed it the first time.", "NTA, and if you\u2019re not getting married again there\u2019s no reason for you to entertain a guy who can\u2019t figure out a mother wanting to maintain the same last name as her child.", "NTA.   it's your name, and your choice.   Be whoever you want to be!", "NTA\n\nIt's natural to keep it after a divorce, especially if there's a child involved.", "NTA but you should invite him to legally change his last name to the surname you share with your ex and child. Problem solved", "NTA\n\nWhere I live (southern USA), it's pretty typical for a woman with children to keep her married name after a divorce.\n\nWhen there are no children, the name change is part of the divorce decree.\n\nYour bf needs to understand that this is not his business and has nothing to do with him and everything to do with your child.\n\nGood Luck", "**NTA**  It's quite common for a divorc\u00e9e to keep her married name, especially when there have children or developed a professional career during the marriage.    Not to mention, it's a major pain to revert to your maiden name...which is one reason young professional women don't take their husbands' names.", "NTA. I have also keept my ex s last name.", "I\u2019ve been married for almost 17 years and I still have my ex\u2019s last name. I use my hubby\u2019s at work so I call it my work alias. It\u2019s just a name it\u2019s not a big deal", "NTA \n\n\"struggling to understand my reasons why\"\n\nI mean, I don't know what to do for him. Your main reason is perfectly clear and makes a lot of sense.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your ex\u2019s name\u2014 it\u2019s yours and your child\u2019s", "Nta. Personally, I wouldn't want to keep it, but I understand your reasoning.  I have a friend who was married to a guy for maybe 2 years about 20 years ago... they never had kids together and she still keeps his last name even on Facebook! I find the whole thing very weird, but in your situation, it's totally understandable", "YTA. Not for not changing your name, it\u2019s your right. But for not \u201cunderstanding.\u201d\nIt\u2019s pretty understandable why he\u2019d be upset if you tried to walk in his shoes for two seconds. The outdated custom that makes woman change their name for their husbands\u2019 mark the woman as the husband\u2019s wife. And you\u2019ve kept that. Of course it\u2019s natural for a current partner to not like it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not uncommon at all for divorcees to keep their last names, especially if the marriage is long-term. My parents are no longer together, but my mother continues to use my father's last name (she never remarried). This is a weird insecurity on your boyfriend's part.", "NTA.  As for the child argument - well, my SIL didn't change her name as in the Netherlands its really hard to change your name so most women just don't.  She has a different name from the kids and no one cares.  You had the name for 13 years - no reason to change it - it is your legal name.  Unless its some really unusual or particularly famous name, there are probably lots of people with that name as well that you aren't planning on running off with.  \n\nThis isn't about your ex - its about practicality.  If your partner is threatened by that, that is his problem.", "NTA\n\nThe moment you changed your name it became yours. That's it. Worn aren't required or supposed to switch their last names based on if they have a relationship with a man or not.", "NTA. This is a male ego thing. It's none of your new partner's busines what surname you choose to use. There is no requirement, or even a societal \"norm\" for women to take back their maiden name after a divorce. You married name IS your name. This would be a conversation I'd have ONCE with a new partner. He either accepts it and never mentions it again, or he stops seeing me.", "NTA. I\u2019m 44 and just got divorced last year. This was my name for 10 years and after everything I went through with my divorce I just don\u2019t feel like changing it. Someone in the divorce subreddit said she kept track of how many things she had to change (cards, accounts, work stuff, etc) and it was over SIXTY items. If I was more bitter or betrayed or something maybe I\u2019d care more about changing, but it\u2019s a super common last name and we also don\u2019t live in the same state. You\u2019re especially NTA because you have kids and your life will be so much easier if you have the same last name as them.", "NTA\n\nIt's just a name. It's very expensive and time consuming to go change your name again. Your child shares that name. That name has been your legal last name for over a decade.\n\nMy mother was separated in the mid-70s. She moved across the country. They \"offically\" divorced in 2006. She kept her married name. \n\nIt was *her* name. It didn't matter where she got it.", "NTA. For legal reasons it's better to have the same last name as 12. No question whether you're her mom for school, doctors or whatever", "NTA. He is being insecure.", "NTA. I'm 31, divorced, and still going by the \"married name\" I took at age 20. I don't have kids, either, I just like my name and didn't want to switch back. My current partner (37m) was curious about the decision when I first told him, but that's all. There's nothing wrong with using your name, and to be clear, it is \\_your\\_ name. I'm guessing that might be the source of your partner's confusion - he sees it as you keeping your ex' name. At the end of the day he doesn't have to understand your reasoning, but he does have to accept it.", "These are not the 1950\u2019s, your child will not be stigmatized for having a different surname than you. Still, NTA, just misguided", "NTA! \n\nMy mum did the same thing! She didn\u2019t want to have to a different surname to her kids. I think it\u2019s a pretty common thing to do", "if my sis got divorced I'd encourage her not to change her name back, ours is kinda stupid", "NTA.  \n\nIf he's not planning to put a ring on your finger then what is the point of him making a fuss? You've already given a reasonable explanation as to why you kept your married name. \n\nAlso, I don't think this is that weird. My husband's cousin has gone through a very civil divorce and she kept her married name as well.  She also has two children with her ex-husband.", "A perfect opportunity for you to introduce Crap Bag \u2026he was Princess Consuela Banana Hammock\u2019s bf.", "Yeah we got stopped in Italy for this also. I have a different surname to my daughter. She has her dads, it didn\u2019t help we were all on 3 different passports at that point. Luckily, I had the foresight to bring a whole bunch of different documents including her birth certificate so once they sighted those they waived us through.", "Except it has nothing to do with her partner and everything to do with her child. Wanting to share a name with your child and avoid going through all the hassle of changing your name back are 2 easy to understand reasons that the new partner should understand", "There it is. Sometimes you have to scroll a while but you can always find a fucking ridiculous, awful opinion only a moron would have if you just keep looking long enough."]}
