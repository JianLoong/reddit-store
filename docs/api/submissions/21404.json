Maybe she thinks she will, but I think she\u2019s only remembering the fun parts of cooing over a little baby and then will want to hand it back when the real work is needed.  No way would she last even a week of multiple bottle feedings and diaper changes. 3rd - I fully expect after a child is born the guilt trip for abandoning would start and she would expect me to raise the kid.  It\u2019s a trap!", "The aunt couldn't even be bothered to care for her kid, yet a kid is apparently the infalible way to keep a partner? Suuure.\n\nNTA and, if you need to keep your partner hostage, the relationship is already dead.", "Fully agree. Kids are NOT something to gamble on. I\u2019m a full believer than unless both parents are \u201cFUCK YEAH LET\u2019S HAVE A BABY\u201d then they shouldn\u2019t have one", "The right mentality, the right supports, and most importantly, the desire.", "From her edit It sounds like the aunt checked out of her kid\u2019s life entirely. Not just had to work long hours and so the kid was with daycare workers.", "I would feel bad for her up until she attacked me for my choices.", "Ugh yes tell me about it. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and that\u2019s another issue lol. My son might have it too\u2026 so navigating his autism, reparenting\u2026 I see the cycle. He has bad anxiety like I do but I try to give him compassion unlike my parents.", "I also have ADHD as does my son. It makes it a lot more difficult to regulate your emotions but it can be done :)", "You all kind of sound like assholes to me. You\u2019re aunt is wrong and you\u2019re also wrong for making assumptions as to why your cousin is so troubled and throwing it in her face. \n\nUnless you know for certain your aunt is the reason he\u2019s an addict (which is kind of impossible to say), it\u2019s a pretty screwed up thing to say. \n\nBut you\u2019re also being very unclear on exactly how your cousin was \u201cleft.\u201d I go to work 9-5 and my daughter goes to daycare. If she becomes an addict, is it my fault for working to support our family ? You\u2019re leaving a lot unclear here.", "NTA   \nShe should follow Thumper's advice (Bambi's rabbit friend) \"If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all.\" She had it coming, and it's not like you said a lie", "NTA. When people criticize others, they open themselves up to criticism.", "NTA - first of all people who say they\u2019re having children to \u201ctake care of them and their old age\u201d are morons. There\u2019s no guarantee that your child will outlive you, be capable physically or financially enough to take care of you, or even give a crap about you at your time of need. \n\nSecondly, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but your own whether or not you decide to have children. Or your reasoning. Wanting to break a cycle of abuse *is* a good reason. Recognizing you don\u2019t want to *is* a good reason. You don\u2019t have to defend your choice. \n\nWas what you said unkind? Sure. But minding your own business is free so if she can\u2019t do it, she can\u2019t get mad when someone returns the favor.", "NTA\n\nAuntie needs to learn that people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't harsh. You told the truth.  Next time put them on mute or better yet keep them low contact.", "Kids from middle class, nuclear families who have the best of everything can still wind up with a drug problem. That being said, nobody can force you to have a child. Let your aunt tell your bf to dump you--and let him laugh hysterically in her face. NTA", "I don't really know. Seems to me you're both the assholes. She started it, but you really could've kept your cool, since your aunt doesn't give the impression of a person worth discussing anything with. I think YTA as well because you can't know for sure, you said that to her ONLY to annoy/hurt her because she did the same to you", "NTA!! Point Blank... no one can tell you, you have to have kids.", "stop telling them what you want.  They don't care what you want.  Just agree all the time and do what you want.  Don't explain or try to justify.  They love a good confrontation.  \"You need to do this!\"  \"You NEED to do that!\"  Yeh. Sure. No problem.  Whatever you want.  Moving on", "Esh", "Secondly, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but your own whether or not you decide to have children.", "It's not useless if it makes her shut up and knock it off\n\nIf she was a decent reasonable person then you just ask her to stop, but that hasn't worked so she isn't and you gotta use the kind of communication that works with assholes like her aunt", "You don't deserve the downvotes you are getting. The aunt and family are obviously AH. But I am surprised by how many people think that means it is okay to say something hurtful on purpose that is just a personal opinion.\n\nUnless OP is a psychiatrist, or trained professional, how is she remotely qualified to make the statement that the kid is an addict because of the aunt being a single mom. Might as well roll out the racist tropes about kids with absentee fathers...\n\nThis is an obvious ESH, even if OP was antoginized into lashing out. She still said something that was designed to be as hurtful as possible.", "Don't forget to edit your N T A so it doesn't get counted in the voting.\n\nAnd yeah, that would have been a much more appropriate response.", "Exactly this.", "I wonder if there have been any studies done comparing the costs, labor, risks, and ROI of the following, strictly from the perspective of planning for old age:\n\nA 401k/IRA\nLong term care insurance\nReal estate investing\nA High yield savings account\nA human child\n\nSomehow I think there's flaws in her logic outside just the factor of ethics \ud83e\udd14", "Thank you. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right!", "That would be an interesting read. Once I'm home from work I think I'll do a little searching and see if such a thing exists.", "Yeah he\u2019s super forgetful just like me. My husband was like uh, have you noticed that the things you yell at him for\u2026 you should yell at yourself for? I KNOW, STOPPPP."]}
