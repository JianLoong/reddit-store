As expected I am very happy and am sharing news of my pregnancy on Facebook as I have several family members who live overseas and also I want to. This is my first child and I am beyond happy.\n\nThe issue is my older sister (29F) who is infertile and has given up on children after 9 miscarriages. I and my sister have never had a good relationship, she was sick as a baby and nearly died. The trauma of it caused my parents to favor her and place her above me. I was always expected to make myself as small as possible to accommodate her. \n\nShe always got a cake and more presents on my birthday so she wouldn't feel left out, I was told to hide my grades as she did very badly at school, I was also not allowed to display any trophies in my room because she might see them and get upset. My sister 100% leaned into this and made my life hell. She would make stuff up so my parents would take stuff from me and give it to her. I was even told to not go to my prestigious university (think ivy league but in my country) because it would upset her. When I chose to go my parents cut me off. \n\nWhich was fine as my paternal grandparents who raised me took care of everything. Since then I have been LC with my family and only see them around the holiday at my grandparents' place. They weren't invited to my wedding. When I got pregnant I shared the announcement online and everybody congratulated me except my parents and sister who harassed me and reported my post so it would get taken down. I blocked them all.\n\nI saw them again on New Year's at the grandparents' place when they saw me my sister started screaming at my grandparents saying how they could invite me after \"what I did to her\". She was also screaming at my belly as it offended her. She kept crying and saying how I could do this to her. I told her I did nothing to her. She went on and on about her miscarriages and how hard they were on her but I snapped and told her I don't care. She's not my sister, she's my bully who tormented me my whole life. I owe her nothing. My life has nothing to do with her. This got my parents mad and they screamed at me too. My uncles ended up throwing them out and it ruined the party. My family said I did nothing wrong but my parents and my sisters' friend have been mass reporting my FB account until I ended up deleting it.", "created_utc": 1673895120, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dnyd6/aita_for_publicly_sharing_my_pregnancy_saying_i/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your pregnancy has nothing to do with her, and she needs to grow up. Your parents have enabled her to play the victim for her whole life, you don't need to contribute any time and attention to that.", "NTA. You psychologically gave up so much for her\u2026the way she\u2019s acting is so ridiculous. Your sister sounds super entitled and I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with this. Growing up as a glass child is never easy. Congratulations on your pregnancy. I wish she\u2019d had the balls to congratulate you too.", "NTA. Congratulations on your pregnancy. You owe you bully nothing. Go NC and have a happy life.", "Wtf? Absolutely NTA!!! Your parents and sister are the real assholes. Cut them off you life. You don't need enemies with parents like that.", "INFO: *\"my paternal grandparents who raised me took care of everything.\"* How did your parents torment you while your grandparents raised you?", "NTA.\n\nand she needs therapy. Your parents... I'm not even to spend time typing what I think of them. \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I feel bad for her for having to go through 9 miscarriages but your life doesn\u2019t revolve around her. Your parents are horrible parents for their blatant favoritism and making you hide all of your achievements growing up so you camt (in a sense) outshine her.\n\nIf I was you I\u2019d go no contact after this", "NTA. They sound awful", "Surprisingly, NTA !!! Your parents sound like they groomed your sister to act like that so ultimately they are the ones you should direct your anger towards. \nHowever, your sister being offended at you getting pregnant is completely childish and rude. Im sure she had a really hard time emotionally with those 9 miscarriages (whew) and my heart definitely breaks for her. But you are bringing a life into this world, she should be happy and try to mend things with you IMO. \n\nIt\u2019s more than unfortunate that your parents enabled her behavior and brought her up to be so entitled. Ultimately, though, she will have a harder life because of that if she doesn\u2019t already. I think you should take solace in that and potentially forgive her for what she has done to you in the past if not for her but for you. \n\nYour parents are complete assholes and they should 100% be to blame for this all, I think. Cutting you off because you went to college??? It seems like they set you up for failure and you ended up thriving so you should be very proud of yourself. They also pit you both against each other from the moment you arrived, so it would be great if you and your sister could reconnect and not give them the satisfaction of that working. \n\nI have many sisters myself and my dad definitely played favorites on my younger sister, but ultimately we were able to bond through negative experiences facilitated by both of my parents. Im wishing that for you, or at least, peace.", "NTA. And I\u2019m certain you know that. \n\nLooks like low contact won\u2019t be enough in this case\u2026 this is a no further contact situation. What a shame. You would think your parents would be excited and happy for you. There\u2019s no reason to expose your upcoming child to their abusive behaviour", "If your grandparents raised you how did your sister and parents get so many opportunities to harass you?\n\nThis discrepancy makes me think you just want us all to drag your family.", "NTA - wow, your parents are enabling your grown-up sister's bullying? I mean, I get that they wanted to spoil her after almost losing her as a baby, but nothing warrants the harassment the three of them seem to have put you through your whole life. Like, seriously - are you supposed to never be better/ faster than your sister at anything EVER? Jeez. I can't tell how \"bad\" you snapped since you probably paraphrased the interaction, but it seems like your sister had it a long time coming and you should honestly just cut off all contact with her and your parents, the toxic vibes are strong with these ones...\n\nAlso, CONGRATS on your pregnancy!

Congratulations on your pregnancy.", "I came here with an opinion formed by the title, changed by the content. NTA. You should never have to hide your successes from people who claim to be family, I agree with another reply, maybe it\u2019s time to consider whether they are an influence you still want / need in your life. Or if you want that behaviour around your child. But that\u2019s something to discuss with your support system if it\u2019s a step you would consider", "NTA create a new account and share your fantastic news, only \"friend\" people you trust.

Congratulations on baby.", "Is you parents last name Dursley?", "ESH, you\u2019re entitled to your life and opinions but you didn\u2019t have to say that to her. You took the one thing she struggled with the most and stabbed her with it.

She needs therapy not harassment, what is wrong with you?", "ESH\n\nGoing through a miscarriage is a really painful thing, and to go through it some many time and eventually have to give up is especially brutal.  It's great that you are happy with your pregnancy, and too bad that you and your sister don't get along, but what you did was cruel, and now you are being the bully that you accused her of being.  It'd be like showing up at a funeral and acting like it was a birthday party.\n\nIf you don't want to be friends with her anymore, just go your own way but you don't need to kick her while she is down.  Be the bigger/better person, what you are doing is stooping to her level and doing a lot of the same things mean things that she did to you.  \n\nEnjoy your pregnancy, don't get bogged down in the negativity of the past when things are going so well.", "NTA- Your parents and sister are assholes. CONGRATULATIONS !!!!!!", "NTA\n\nWow, it\u2019s good you went no contact with them because they are horribly abusive to you. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this shit while you\u2019re pregnant. Given how she started it & her behavior, you had absolutely every right to defend yourself in that way.

We are taught from an early age WE are the problem, and our reactions to others treating us horribly is what causes conflict in the family, not the other peoples\u2019 behaviors. What seems obvious to someone from a healthy, functioning family is not so obvious to us, particularly when we get attacked en masse for sticking up for ourselves by abusive family members and their flying monkeys.\n\nBtw OP you are NTA and I\u2019m proud of you for sticking up for yourself.", "Why not if it makes someone feel better?\nHere goes, op's parent and sister are trash people. Cut them out completely.", "So much this", "Huh\u2026 you do bring up a valid question. Clearly the parents and sister are TA.", "Nailed it", "Ahh the YTA but not for the reasons laid out in the post.", "Ya probably, but they do suck", "I only saw them during the holidays at my grandparents' place but I don't think I can anymore. Not for me but for my kid, I don't want her exposed to that.", "Probably was a safe haven when it got bad. Probably was the people who actually allowed op to be her and loved her.", ">It'd be like showing up at a funeral and acting like it was a birthday party.\n\nYou're saying that her sister's fertility problems have transformed the life of the entire family into a perpetual funeral. That's absolute bullshit. \n\nOP is preggers, she's absolutely entitled to announce the good news to family and friends. She doesn't need to be cloistered in a convent to hide her condition. \n\nNTA", "Wait, what did she do wrong?", "Are you joking? OP went to a New Years party at her grandparents house NOT to her parents or sisters place. She's already otherwise NC with them. She had already announced her pregnancy online so she didn't even announce it at her grandparents house. They're the ones who started harassing her out of nowhere. She doesn't need to give a single shit about her lifelong tormentors fertility problems. All she did was stand up for herself after years of bullying and favoritism. She is firmly NTA.", "Yeah let yourself be bullied and stomped over to make everyone happy. Oh shut it...\nShe was just at the party, she didn't announced it there, she was just there. She can't be there cause she is pregnant and it will make sister sad?", "Literally nothing you\u2019ve said makes even the tiniest bit of sense. OP going to a family function whilst being pregnant is not being a bully or kicking anyone while they are down. Telling someone that your life has nothing to do with them is not being a bully. Telling the person that actively tortured you for your entire childhood that you don\u2019t care what they\u2019ve been through is not being a bully. \n\nOnly someone as terrible as OPs sister would write something this warped.", "My husband doesn't understand why this is why I apologize so much, or why I always feel that conflicts are my fault, even if my therapist has said I was in the right. I'm working on it, but it is so hard to explain to people that you just always feel WRONG. \n\nNTA OP. Your parents and sister are... Words I cannot say.", "Definitely not, and you'd never be able to leave her in a room with them, even for a toilet break. They'd find ways to weasel in and manipulate her.\n\nNothing sucks more than having to go NC, but it sounds like this option causes less pain and stress for everyone.\n\nBest of luck with the rest of your pregnancy! I hope you celebrate and enjoy it well, and enjoy being a mother. :)"]}
