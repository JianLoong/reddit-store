I was always expected to make myself as small as possible to accommodate her. \n\nShe always got a cake and more presents on my birthday so she wouldn't feel left out, I was told to hide my grades as she did very badly at school, I was also not allowed to display any trophies in my room because she might see them and get upset. My sister 100% leaned into this and made my life hell. She would make stuff up so my parents would take stuff from me and give it to her. I was even told to not go to my prestigious university (think ivy league but in my country) because it would upset her. When I chose to go my parents cut me off. \n\nWhich was fine as my paternal grandparents who raised me took care of everything.

But you are bringing a life into this world, she should be happy and try to mend things with you IMO. \n\nIt\u2019s more than unfortunate that your parents enabled her behavior and brought her up to be so entitled. Ultimately, though, she will have a harder life because of that if she doesn\u2019t already. I think you should take solace in that and potentially forgive her for what she has done to you in the past if not for her but for you. \n\nYour parents are complete assholes and they should 100% be to blame for this all, I think. Cutting you off because you went to college??? It seems like they set you up for failure and you ended up thriving so you should be very proud of yourself. They also pit you both against each other from the moment you arrived, so it would be great if you and your sister could reconnect and not give them the satisfaction of that working. \n\nI have many sisters myself and my dad definitely played favorites on my younger sister, but ultimately we were able to bond through negative experiences facilitated by both of my parents.

You\u2019ll see that your subconscious has already put \u2018my family\u2019 and your parents and sister in two different categories. You already know they aren\u2019t family and not worth any of your time, emotions or thoughts.", "It sounds like you need to report them for harassment NTA", "You need to completely cut them out of yours and your child's life. No one deserves that kind of treatment.", "NTA. You have done nothing wrong. They're deranged and you may need yo take legal action against them if they don't leave you alone", "NTA. Post in detail on social media what she and your parents did, tag them before blocking them, then go NC after that. But then again I\u2019m petty.", "NTA \n\nFirst of all congratulations for your pregnancy! \n\nYour sister is an egocentric person and has been fed this by your parents her whole life. It's only right that you stopped caring about such people. \nIf I was in you I would cut contact forever, and it's better for your future children not to have such people near them. \n\nI'm sure your sister doesn't care about every pregnant lady out there, it's not about her not having kids, it's more about her not having kids before you. \n\nI'm also happy you have a big part of the family on your side. \n\nHope there's only nice things for you \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Honestly, good for you - she sounds unhinged. Your parents are even worse because they\u2019re the ones who have enabled her and made her into who she is. \n\nA word of caution though: make sure she doesn\u2019t know your address/work address/places you frequent and get a good home security/camera on your doors. Your sister sounds unhinged enough that she could actually pose a threat to you or to your unborn child.", "dude, even if she didn\u2019t bully you, are you just supposed to never ever get pregnant because she can\u2019t? that\u2019s fucking insane. NTA", "NTA, Your sister and parents should have supported you but instead they yelled at you. \nTo make it worse they put your sister above you, made you feel less and cut you off when you chose to go to an Ivy League school.", "NTA, she made your life hell along with your parents. Cut them off completely it will only cause stress that will hurt the baby. Stay strong, you can do this.", "classic case of title makes it seem like you might BTA, but wooooooow the post tells a much different story. NTA, your parents and sister definitely are in the wrong", "NTA SEVER ALL TIES YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF", "It sounds like a miserable childhood. Just miserable. \n\nShe was and is the golden child, but the one thing your parents could not give her is a pregnancy that leads to a full-term birth. This is your time to glow. Enjoy it. Not as 'revenge' but as a happy moment in life.\n\nYou have already gone NC. Stick to it. And enjoy this time with your grandparents and family that is supportive. I hope your baby is born healthy and all is well in your life.\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA, yes, going full NC sucks, I had to do this with my sister because of her toxic husband and her starting to act like him.  But this is WAY beyond toxic. This is more along the lines of insane. after everything you've gone through with them, I wouldn't even be worried whether you're TA or not, because you really aren't. Don't allow them to make you suffer anymore by even feeling remotely bad about any of this.  Congratulations on the pregnancy now get out there and be happy.", "NTA.\n\nWhat are you supposed to do abort the baby? Hide it every time you see your sister or your parents? Pretend the child just doesn't fucking exist??\n\nPeople like that are fucking nuts. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong OP. And your reaction at the party was much tamer than what I would have said If I was in your shoes.\n\nI'd cut them out of your life completely until they grow the fuck up and apologize to you.\n\nSounds like the other members of your family knows this too.", "ESH, she may well be awful, but using miscarriages against someone is a fucking low blow.", "This. Cut all these people out of your life\nNTA", "\"raised\" doesn't automatically mean \"lived with\".  \nMy ex says his grandparents raised him. I know he lived with his mother, but she was so neglectful of him that he ran away to live on the streets when he was 15. He credits his grandparents with raising him. He hung out at their place a lot after school before he ran away.", "Story sounds like they tried to make a post as horrific as possible to do a bait-and-switch with the title. I mean, she makes it sound like her family supposedly did a point and scream out of \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\" because she was pregnant and someone with as much hate (justified hate if the story isnt made up) wouldnt need to ask if they are the AH.", "Certainly not. You are definitrly NTA. Congratulations on your pregnancy and all the best.", "OP you don't need this stress. Either during the pregnancy or after giving birth, when you will have your hands full with your kid and your body will be recovering. G\n\nAlso, what will be your get togethers at your grandparents' be like after the kid is born? Will be expected to hide them? If you bring your kid to the dinners will your sister throw a fit? \n\nI think you should think about these things as well and decide on your boundaries. Talk to your grandparents and uncles about what to do for future get togethers.\n\nNTA", "Don't know why this was voted down.  \nIt's objectively true. OP was emotionally abused (read the post again; she was made to feel like she was *nothing* whereas her sister was *everything.* You may think it's tame, as abuse goes, but the effect is there). Also, people who are emotionally abused by parents often internalise it, as it's their *parents*, the ones who give them their first and deepest beliefs of how the world works, doing the abusing.\n\nAnd it apparently needed to be said. People always underestimate how much being abused as a child can skew your vision on what's right and what you deserve.  \nLuckily OP has grandparents who were able to mitigate the damage, but mitigation is not prevention.", "[removed]", "Oh, yes, because in their minds the sister deserves a baby more than OP...\n\nFrankly, the sister sounds unhinged enough that it is probably for the best that she is not a mother.", "My spouse does not read the news much. He could not even believe it was a thing when I told him about the latest murder of a pregnant woman for her baby.\n\nI can understand his disbelief. It is just horrifying to contemplate."]}
