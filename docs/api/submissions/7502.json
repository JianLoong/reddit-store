I and my sister have never had a good relationship, she was sick as a baby and nearly died. The trauma of it caused my parents to favor her and place her above me. I was always expected to make myself as small as possible to accommodate her. \n\nShe always got a cake and more presents on my birthday so she wouldn't feel left out, I was told to hide my grades as she did very badly at school, I was also not allowed to display any trophies in my room because she might see them and get upset. My sister 100% leaned into this and made my life hell. She would make stuff up so my parents would take stuff from me and give it to her. I was even told to not go to my prestigious university (think ivy league but in my country) because it would upset her. When I chose to go my parents cut me off. \n\nWhich was fine as my paternal grandparents who raised me took care of everything. Since then I have been LC with my family and only see them around the holiday at my grandparents' place. They weren't invited to my wedding. When I got pregnant I shared the announcement online and everybody congratulated me except my parents and sister who harassed me and reported my post so it would get taken down. I blocked them all.\n\nI saw them again on New Year's at the grandparents' place when they saw me my sister started screaming at my grandparents saying how they could invite me after \"what I did to her\". She was also screaming at my belly as it offended her. She kept crying and saying how I could do this to her. I told her I did nothing to her. She went on and on about her miscarriages and how hard they were on her but I snapped and told her I don't care. She's not my sister, she's my bully who tormented me my whole life. I owe her nothing. My life has nothing to do with her. This got my parents mad and they screamed at me too. My uncles ended up throwing them out and it ruined the party.

Your parents sound like they groomed your sister to act like that so ultimately they are the ones you should direct your anger towards. \nHowever, your sister being offended at you getting pregnant is completely childish and rude. Im sure she had a really hard time emotionally with those 9 miscarriages (whew) and my heart definitely breaks for her. But you are bringing a life into this world, she should be happy and try to mend things with you IMO. \n\nIt\u2019s more than unfortunate that your parents enabled her behavior and brought her up to be so entitled. Ultimately, though, she will have a harder life because of that if she doesn\u2019t already. I think you should take solace in that and potentially forgive her for what she has done to you in the past if not for her but for you. \n\nYour parents are complete assholes and they should 100% be to blame for this all, I think. Cutting you off because you went to college??? It seems like they set you up for failure and you ended up thriving so you should be very proud of yourself. They also pit you both against each other from the moment you arrived, so it would be great if you and your sister could reconnect and not give them the satisfaction of that working. \n\nI have many sisters myself and my dad definitely played favorites on my younger sister, but ultimately we were able to bond through negative experiences facilitated by both of my parents. Im wishing that for you, or at least, peace.", "NTA. And I\u2019m certain you know that. \n\nLooks like low contact won\u2019t be enough in this case\u2026 this is a no further contact situation.

OP went to a New Years party at her grandparents house NOT to her parents or sisters place. She's already otherwise NC with them. She had already announced her pregnancy online so she didn't even announce it at her grandparents house. They're the ones who started harassing her out of nowhere.

She can't be there cause she is pregnant and it will make sister sad?", "Literally nothing you\u2019ve said makes even the tiniest bit of sense. OP going to a family function whilst being pregnant is not being a bully or kicking anyone while they are down. Telling someone that your life has nothing to do with them is not being a bully. Telling the person that actively tortured you for your entire childhood that you don\u2019t care what they\u2019ve been through is not being a bully. \n\nOnly someone as terrible as OPs sister would write something this warped.", "My husband doesn't understand why this is why I apologize so much, or why I always feel that conflicts are my fault, even if my therapist has said I was in the right.

What a childhood filled with grief you had!", "nta", "NTA - a family who abuses together does not need to stay together.  I commend you from doing your best to break the cycle and go NC.  The parents have crippled your sister to expect the world to cater to her needs.  However I'd watch your baby like a hawk around that sister if you even have to be around her once it is born.", "NTA, please go no contact.  Families can be a tremendous comfort when they are loving and supportive, but your family sounds toxic and abusive.   Which down the road can cause you a lot of emotional issues as well as your child.  Stay away from them, and Go out and live your life to the fullest, and congrats on your new baby.", "NTA.\n\nNo problems sharing your pregnancy. If she doesn't like that, she can unfriend you on social media. As long as you're not being a jerk and rubbing her face/mocking her, I don't see the issue here. You all probably need therapy. Having parents like that is pretty gnarly as well.   \n\n\nThey'll realize their mistake too late, when they understand that they alienated their only link to grandkids.", "After reading the title my first thought was YTA. But after reading the body I\u2019m going with NTA. As someone who\u2019s had miscarriages, it\u2019s really fucking hard.

Wishing you the best.", "NTA.  Congrats on your big news!\n\nNo, you don't have to stop living because things aren't going the way your sister wants.\n\nAs most people are suggesting, it's time to go full no contact with your parents and sister.", "NTA. I'm so sorry that you've had to put up with that constant belittlement and bullying your whole childhood. You do not need to do anything to make your sister \"feel better\". Your parents and sister are super toxic and definitely need to be kept out of your life. I'm surprised your relatives still allow get-togethers with you and your family if they know how awfully your family has treated you.", "Esh but also nta", "This sounds like it was written by an angry middle schooler", "NTA as sorry as I feel for your sister no one life and joy should stop because she can\u2019t have children. Your sister has mental issues and she really needs help and not be coddled by family. I would stay away from her especially once your baby is born.", "I mean this in a civil way: such a question implies zero knowledge of how abuse and neglect affects people, even if that is not accurate. The wording implies sarcasm, not sincerity.\n\nNTA", "My guess is that she was dropped off with them a lot when sister needed medical care", "Sounds like that was only when she went to college and was disowned by her parents", "Honestly I would go no contact and quite frankly I'm worried about you if they're that deranged. Do not ever be alone with these people.", "Yep exactly. Spent literally 10 years of my life believing I was in the wrong constantly and developed really bad anxieties over it because of the way family treated me. Especially when you\u2019re young and you don\u2019t know that your family isn\u2019t \u2018normal\u2019 so it really messes you up.\n\nOP NTA", "Hmm thats a fair point", "If thats true I wouldn't say college age is young enough to still be raised by someone but that might be a harsh view or too black and white of me.", "It took my husband almost 10 years to grasp the full scope of it. It is so hard for people who grew up in a healthy/mostly healthy environment to grasp the psychology of childhood abuse/neglect, but it CAN be done, I promise! Keep taking care of yourself \ud83d\udc95", "It took me 30 years and a diagnosis that should have been caught in my teens to go no contact with my parents. I have felt more confident, calm, and sure of myself in the last 2 years than I have in the three decades before! Breaking the cycle is hard, and what worked for me may not be the answer for you, but there IS a light at the end of the tunnel. I\u2019m now expecting my own child and NOTHING has ever made me want to make sure I break the wheel more than this."]}
