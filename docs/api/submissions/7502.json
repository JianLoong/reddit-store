I was always expected to make myself as small as possible to accommodate her. \n\nShe always got a cake and more presents on my birthday so she wouldn't feel left out, I was told to hide my grades as she did very badly at school, I was also not allowed to display any trophies in my room because she might see them and get upset. My sister 100% leaned into this and made my life hell. She would make stuff up so my parents would take stuff from me and give it to her. I was even told to not go to my prestigious university (think ivy league but in my country) because it would upset her. When I chose to go my parents cut me off. \n\nWhich was fine as my paternal grandparents who raised me took care of everything. Since then I have been LC with my family and only see them around the holiday at my grandparents' place. They weren't invited to my wedding.

She went on and on about her miscarriages and how hard they were on her but I snapped and told her I don't care. She's not my sister, she's my bully who tormented me my whole life. I owe her nothing.

Your parents sound like they groomed your sister to act like that so ultimately they are the ones you should direct your anger towards. \nHowever, your sister being offended at you getting pregnant is completely childish and rude.

But you are bringing a life into this world, she should be happy and try to mend things with you IMO. \n\nIt\u2019s more than unfortunate that your parents enabled her behavior and brought her up to be so entitled. Ultimately, though, she will have a harder life because of that if she doesn\u2019t already. I think you should take solace in that and potentially forgive her for what she has done to you in the past if not for her but for you. \n\nYour parents are complete assholes and they should 100% be to blame for this all, I think. Cutting you off because you went to college??? It seems like they set you up for failure and you ended up thriving so you should be very proud of yourself. They also pit you both against each other from the moment you arrived, so it would be great if you and your sister could reconnect and not give them the satisfaction of that working. \n\nI have many sisters myself and my dad definitely played favorites on my younger sister, but ultimately we were able to bond through negative experiences facilitated by both of my parents.

Growing up, I had a friend who had parents, lived full-time with them, but I never met them because they seemed to be at work or away literally all the time. His grandmother also lived with them and I would say she's the one who raised him, taught him how to take care of himself, showed him all the things he now loves (music, books, theatre) and who always supported him in everything, encouraged him to work hard without being punishing, and was the biggest influence in his life in almost every way.\n\nWhen she died a couple of years ago (of old age and old-age-related illness), he was understandably really distraught. Recently, I was genuinely surprised to find out at least his mother is still alive, because he never talks about her at all, even though they've apparently got a not-bad relationship (I say not-bad because, again, literally never talks about her). His birthday posts to his mom are a couple of lines and a photo of them together from when he was a child, and his posts about his grandmother vary in length but are way more heartfelt and her presence in his life is noticeable when he talks about his love of books and other things.\n\nSo I guess it's possible OP is misleading us, but I've known a lot of situations like that in my generation as I was growing up (usually when the parents worked all the time and were emotionally distant, but also sometimes when they were malicious towards their kids) but I don't have a reason to doubt it.
