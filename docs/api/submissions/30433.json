An exact copy, the specs would be the exact same, I might even suggest looking on ebay/facebook marketplace etc. And send her AND your mother a few links to places selling the exact model camera you have, and if you really, really, want to twist the knife, and it's cheap enough, buy it yourself and give it to her as a peace offering with a perfectly sweet smile!\n\nHowever, if she says no to any of the above, and it has to be your cherished childhood memento, then this is obviously about hurting you, and this entire drama is about taking something you love from you.

Your sisters over-reaction tells everyone all they need to know. She wants it because it is yours. The fact you don't have a good relationship makes it all the more sus.  \n\n\nStart hiding important stuff, because it is likely if she can't hurt you via the camera she will try another way to hurt you.", "NTA - The camera is yours, you have no obligation to give it to her, and its never a good idea to give an entitled narcisstic person what they want, it reinforces their bad behavior and makes it worse. If I were you, I would hide the camera somewhere or leave it with a trusted friend and simply tell them that you removed the SD card and sold it so that it wouldn't be a point of contention in the family anymore. Let your sister buy her own camera, they are pretty cheap nowadays anyway, and any camera she gets is likely to be much better than your old one.", "NTA\nIf its an item you care about, its understandable that you don\u2019t want it to be taken across the world by someone other than yourself. \n\nI agree with the posts above.

However, now that you have made such a fuss about your childhood camera, it might be best to put it away in your room instead of leaving it in storage. At least pretend that it is important to you and you want it for sentimental reasons (and because your sister was never nice to you so why should you be nice to her?). I get that but it doesn't sound like your sister does if she has already bought an attachment for YOUR camera. Bottom line - it is your camera and you do not have to give it to your sister. I really do not understand why your sister (or your mother) don't simply buy a new camera?", "Why does your sister even need a camera in this day and age?  If she has a half decent cell phone, it would have a camera, so why can't she just use that?  Even older phone cameras would probably be better than your old Sony camera as far as picture quality is concerned.  You're NTA.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to, but here is what I would do: First of all, take the sd card out and back it up. \n\nThen, put the sd card in another device (laptop or smartphone), type an error message in a text processor and take a screenshot (maybe a message like a faulty sd card slot or something, definitely something that can\u2019t be easily fixed). Then save the screenshot on the sd card and put the sd card back into the camera. Open the error-message picture on the camera and take a picture of it on the camera, and make sure that your hand holding the camera is visible so it\u2019s obvious that you took the picture and didn\u2019t just google a picture. \n\nAfterwards, tell your family that you changed your mind/ wanted to surprise her with the camera and wanted to check that it was still working properly, but saaadly it\u2019s irreparably broken. And store the camera at a friend\u2019s house from now on until you move out.", "NTA, it\u2019s yours, you shouldn\u2019t have to give it to someone else.\n\nI suggest you take out the SD card, backup everything and hide the camera.

Because kindness is not transactional.", "As I mentioned in another comment, I had forgotten the npd detail. That makes a huge difference. I had overseen the possibility of your sister just trying to be cruel. \n\nAll my siblings are from my dad\u2019s previous marriage to a narcissist abuser. The older siblings took after her. I literally never got a thing from them. Just one of many examples: I remember when I was like 7 and my brother was 17, I wanted a baseball glove. My dad said he wouldn\u2019t buy me one because there was a glove my size out in a bag in the garage. It was my brother\u2019s- didn\u2019t fit him, hadn\u2019t used it in a decade.

But I was stoked. \n\nUntil my brother literally tackled me in the back yard ripping it from my hand, screaming that it was his and not to touch his stuff. Then he punched me in the chest and took it. \n\nSo when I read you had something a sibling could use that you weren\u2019t using, well I relived being told to not even look at my siblings things.
