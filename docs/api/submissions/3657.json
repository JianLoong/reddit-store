She wasn't there for your needs and you are not required to be there for hers. It's always telling when someone only contacts you once they need something and says \"but I'm your ____.\" \n\nCut them all off and build a happy life.", "NTA\n\nI grew up in similar circumstances but my mother was more abusive than what you've described. So let me share the lesson that I learned the hard way with you.\n\nBlind faith to family is something that only those with loving families can afford. You can't be a spoiled brat if mommy didn't love you, and why should you intercede with what is obviously karma?\n\nWould it make you the bigger person? Sure. But it's not a requirement. You lost your obligation when she started treating you as a burden rather than her child.", "Absolutely NTA. They mistreated you (this sounds borderline abusive) *terribly*. When you were 18 you did the right thing and got out of a horrible situation. You cut off contact. Nobody ever got in touch with you to make amends or even just to check in. But now that there is looming and significant financial burden suddenly you're needed again? No way. You are absolutely in the right to decline, especially after they prefaced their asking for money by telling you they didn't miss you. Yikes. Sorry you've had to go through this.", "NTA. You owe them nothing. They see you only as a potential source of money.", "NTA. If the concept of 'family' truly mattered to any of them, your sisters would have acted like it while you were all growing up & in the years since you left home; they wouldn't have the audacity to now try to gloss over your mother making your first 18 years horrible with her openly cruel, systematic emotional abuse as \"random shit\". Obviously family is a negotiable concept to them, one that they only apply to you when they want something. They've never done anything to actually earn a favor from you, & you don't owe them shit.\n\nAs for your mother, you don't owe her shit, either. How nice, she managed to achieve the absolute baseline of parenting by not treating you so badly that CPS felt the urge to get involved on your behalf. That's a bar low enough to trip over, & actually her job, as the responsible adult who chose to bring you into this world. You certainly never asked to be born, as that's literally not possible. It's unfortunate for her that she can't depend on the daughters she favored so heavily over you to provide everything she needs now that she's seriously afflicted, but that's not your fault, or your problem to solve. \n\nAll of them need to accept the consequences of their neglect toward you. Shared DNA doesn't give them a right to abuse you in any way, including neglect; shared DNA doesn't obligate you to patiently accept their abuse & eagerly hand over whatever they want (time, money, effort, etc) whenever they demand it. If you haven't blocked them all yet, you should give it some thought.", "NTA! Oh this is RICH! NOW THEY REMEMBER THEY HAVE A SON/BROTHER? When the shit hits the fan? Sucks for them. You don't owe anybody anything. Blood does not make you family. Perhaps your mother and sisters should have remembered you were family from the start and they wouldn't be stuck in this shitty situation they created for themselves. Live your life. Congrats on cutting out these toxic and neglectful people from your life!", "NTA\n\nShe's right, though, bickering over old wounds repeatedly may sound childish. Block and go full NC would be the adult reply. \n\nHope therapy helped, OP. No child deserves to be treated that way.", "NTA\n\nBlock them all. You owe them nothing just because you're genetically linked.", "NTA,  your mom and sisters are.\nShe gave you nothing but stress and ended up in therapy. You owe her nothing.", "How long has it been since you turned your 18 and cut them off? If it had been a significant period of time I feel that makes this whole situation much worse. Basically ghost you until money is needed then hold their paws out when times get tough.\n\nSounds like your family needs to ask themselves if they would provide the support they seem to want from you if it had been you diagnosed with ALS and not your mother.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\nI feel so sad for you.\nYour mother has behaved absolutely appallingly.  She deserves nothing from you.\n\nThere are 3 of them. Let them deal with it. \n\n** It has always gotten up my nose that these bloody people treat their children like absolute shit... Then they get old or sick? And expect the children to jump in and care for them.  And yes. Often the sibling / s that wasn't treated badly? Cannot accept that the child that's been treated like shit doesn't just forgive & forget.\n\nThis situatuon is not as unusual as people think.", "NTA. \n\nPeople hate it when the chickens roost at home. \ud83e\udee2", "NTA. Pushing you out of her body doesn't entitle her to lifelong financial and emotional support from you.\n\nIt's so fucking easy for them to go \"but family!\" when they never acted like one in the first place. Family supports you. Cares for you. They don't neglect you and disappear from your life only to come back and ask for something.\n\nStick to your guns.", "NTA\u2014 my kids always say that I may have a favorite dog but if I have a favorite kid they couldn\u2019t guess which one it is. I always tell them it\u2019s whoever refreshed my ice water last and they laugh\u2014 children deserve unfettered, unconditional love, and parents who can\u2019t handle that reap what they sow.", "Family doesn\\`t equal eternal obligation because there is this thing called love and mutual respect. So if one side doesn\\`t get any of it through out their life - they are under no obligation to help the other one when hard times come.

They stopped being your family when they started neglecting you for not having a specific sex/gender. \nYour mum didn't and doesn't feel guilty and told you to your face you even existed, she even left you at home and showed off her daughters like they were her accessories.

And an abuse victim refusing to help their former abuser (along with the abusers flying monkey brigade) is also not even close to being in the wrong.\n\nAs you're not taking random stuff out on your Mum and are instead refusing to help your former abuser who has not been part of your life for some time.
