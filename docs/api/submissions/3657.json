So let me share the lesson that I learned the hard way with you.\n\nBlind faith to family is something that only those with loving families can afford. You can't be a spoiled brat if mommy didn't love you, and why should you intercede with what is obviously karma?\n\nWould it make you the bigger person? Sure. But it's not a requirement. You lost your obligation when she started treating you as a burden rather than her child.", "Absolutely NTA. They mistreated you (this sounds borderline abusive) *terribly*. When you were 18 you did the right thing and got out of a horrible situation. You cut off contact. Nobody ever got in touch with you to make amends or even just to check in. But now that there is looming and significant financial burden suddenly you're needed again? No way. You are absolutely in the right to decline, especially after they prefaced their asking for money by telling you they didn't miss you. Yikes. Sorry you've had to go through this.", "NTA. You owe them nothing. They see you only as a potential source of money.", "NTA. If the concept of 'family' truly mattered to any of them, your sisters would have acted like it while you were all growing up & in the years since you left home; they wouldn't have the audacity to now try to gloss over your mother making your first 18 years horrible with her openly cruel, systematic emotional abuse as \"random shit\". Obviously family is a negotiable concept to them, one that they only apply to you when they want something. They've never done anything to actually earn a favor from you, & you don't owe them shit.\n\nAs for your mother, you don't owe her shit, either. How nice, she managed to achieve the absolute baseline of parenting by not treating you so badly that CPS felt the urge to get involved on your behalf. That's a bar low enough to trip over, & actually her job, as the responsible adult who chose to bring you into this world. You certainly never asked to be born, as that's literally not possible. It's unfortunate for her that she can't depend on the daughters she favored so heavily over you to provide everything she needs now that she's seriously afflicted, but that's not your fault, or your problem to solve. \n\nAll of them need to accept the consequences of their neglect toward you. Shared DNA doesn't give them a right to abuse you in any way, including neglect; shared DNA doesn't obligate you to patiently accept their abuse & eagerly hand over whatever they want (time, money, effort, etc) whenever they demand it. If you haven't blocked them all yet, you should give it some thought.", "NTA! Oh this is RICH! NOW THEY REMEMBER THEY HAVE A SON/BROTHER? When the shit hits the fan? Sucks for them. You don't owe anybody anything. Blood does not make you family. Perhaps your mother and sisters should have remembered you were family from the start and they wouldn't be stuck in this shitty situation they created for themselves. Live your life. Congrats on cutting out these toxic and neglectful people from your life!\n\n*Somehow I got a silver award for this. I don't know how, but if someone gave it to me, thank you! Actually made my day!*", "NTA\n\nShe's right, though, bickering over old wounds repeatedly may sound childish. Block and go full NC would be the adult reply. \n\nHope therapy helped, OP.

You were the child, needing a mother.  **Their mother abused you, by choosing to neglect and ignore you**, to not meet your needs as a child.  \n\nWhen a parent abuses a child, it's the parent that broke the parent/child bond/relationship, not the child.

You refusing to come take more abuse isn't taking anything out on her.  It's protecting yourself from her and her band of mean girls.
