It's not that I hate my other half-sisters; I simply have a better sibling bond with Katie. However, my stepmother merley sees it as blatant favouritism, which is ironic coming from her. I have seen plenty of times when she chooses her children over Katie. The only difference is I have more money to burn, and she's financially struggling. Then there's my dad, who just doesn't care about any of this.\n\nThe other day I was speaking to my dad about sending Katie to private school and even creating a college fund worth $200,000. But I was interrupted by my stepmother, who asked about her children. I knew what she meant, but I purely said that they weren't my problem and that is she wanted, she would have to do it herself. This didn't sit well with her, and she began to rant about all the times I have favoured Katie over her children.

I know I will get voted down for this, but I personally think the idea of favoritism on apply to the parents because they are only ones who are morally obiligate to love and treat their children equally. You didn't bring Katie or your other half sibilings into this world. You have no legal or moral obiligation to take care of any of them. You have the right to develop whatever type of relationship you want to have with any of them. There are plently of sibiligns who are not close . There are plenty of sibilings who do not have relationships with each other. Based on your post it does not seem like you have a desire to have a relationship with all your half sibilings which is your right as an human being with your own feels and preferences.", "NTA.  Katie doesn\u2019t have a mother.  Would you be open to taking guardianship of her?  It would surely relieve your dad of the burden of mitigating fights with you and his wife.  I\u2019m sure your dad\u2019s wife is cruel to Katie when no one is looking.", "NTA. Your other half sisters still have their own mother alive while Katie just have you.

What was it?  Why do you (seemingly) not like your step mom? \n\nI just feel like there is a SHIT TON of missing information and that you are purposely keeping this pretty vague. You are 100% not obligated to pay the way of anyone but your own children, BUT (in all honesty) it sounds like you are passively punishing your other half siblings because of your dislike for your step mom which is a dick move unless you have reason for it. \n\nI don\u2019t feel comfortable giving a judgement until you answer the aforementioned questions.", "Technically you have the right to pick favorites but it is destroying the family already.

Because you prove in your comments you are racist", "This is your money and ultimately you can do with it whatever you want, but... that being said, favouritism is never good.

There\u2019s a difference from showing a little extra attention to Katie too offset some of the favoritism by her step mother and actively showing favoritism because you want to take a stance or make some point or stick it to your stepmother. The younger 2 won\u2019t be kids forever and they will see this and remember how you made them feel. Also doing things like this can really place these kids in a us vs them mindset and soon they\u2019ll be adults with a bunch of hatred a resentment for one another and not even know why. You could possibly be setting the tone for a negative relationship between all your sisters. You as the 30 year old adult should be showing them how to treat each other with fairness and kindness since your stepmother is failing at this. You should be counteracting her bullshit not doubling up on it.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your money, and your argument about Katie not having a mother and wanting to look out for her is admirable.  However, I think you knew how this all would come across, and you may be relishing in the justice of it all a little too much.  You admit to having more money to spend on Katie than she has to spoil her own kids, and that sort of dynamic is not healthy for Katie\u2019s relationship with her sisters, and could lead to further division in the future.  If you truly have the opportunity to provide for all 3 sisters, maybe not equally, you should consider doing so, even if only for Katie\u2019s benefit.

If you don't care about it (it seems you don't), keep doing what you want for your favourite half sister.

You are taking your dislike of your stepmother out on innocent children, and it\u2019s pretty despicable. Of course you don\u2019t have a sibling bond with them, you spend all your time and money lavishing gifts on Katie while ignoring them. If your stepmother also behaves badly towards some of the children, that doesn\u2019t excuse you doing the same. Your dad also sucks for allowing any of this.", "Listen. This isn't a cut and dry NTA, but I'm leaning that way. As others have said, no you don't have to treat your other siblings the same. I wouldn't care for your step-mum's entitlement either. \n\nThat said, are you hurting the feelings of your younger siblings unnecessarily? Of course life isn't always fair, and you can have a favourite with good reason, bit eventually, with your step mum's rectoric ringing in their ears, they are going to think you don't like them when they have done nothing wrong, and they may also believe it is due to race.", "NTA. You're not their parent, you have zero obligation to treat them the same way, It's called a sibling friendship!\nPlus she mistreats Katie, you're just making it even.", "YTA, I'm interested to know if racism does plat a part here since you've been vague in that regard. It seems to take your dislike of your stepmother out on her children which is unfair and will only breed resentment between your sisters.", "NTA. Especially given Katie doesn't have her mother. You filed a caring role for her so you have a bond.  It's your sibling, you don't have to treat them all the same.  Your dad is a bit of an A H for being \"neutral\" in a situation that he is the common denominator.  He has 4 kids with 3 women and is dissapointed in you for not funding all of them?", "What you must consider is that everything your step mother sees going to Katie (and not her kids), she will extract emotionally from Katie.\n\nYou\u2019re better off doing secret things.\n\nIf you can help out your other sisters it would be nice if you could.\n\nNTA", "Katie doesn\u2019t have a mum any longer - NTA for being there for her", "NTA, this is simple jealousy that she can\u2019t provide for her family the way you could.

But i do have a question cause i am a bit confused about the mention of Katie race, are you and katie and your dad the same race and your stepmother a different race and so her bio kids mixed and she is saying you are favouring katie over them for that reason or is katie the one that mixed race and is she trying to call you a racist and saying you favour her because she is mix? \n\nEither way i dont think your the ahole its just what she said and your response make me a little confused and curious.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
