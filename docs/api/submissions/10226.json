Then you amped up the PDA, knowing it would elicit a reaction. \n\nBeyond that, you have some stuff to work through. \n\nAs long as the two of you are happy with the relationship, stop worrying about what your family thinks about your marriage. Their negativity is only going to hurt you. \n\nIf your husband is overly controlling (notice that he was the one touching you at dinner, not the other way around), maybe your family is picking up on unhealthy elements of your marriage.

Your insecurity should not be put on other people like that.", "ESH. Obviously wrong of your aunt to make assumptions, and your dad/brother for starting shit with your husband. With that said, why did you decide to engage in your aunt's drama and beg your husband to go to something he would not enjoy just to unnecessarily prove a point?! Why do you feel the need to make that point? You shouldn't have to prove anything to anyone, her opinion shouldn't hold that kind of weight.

At least your husband tried to go to make you happy.  That's the only NON-AH thing about this.", "YTA who cares what your aunt is telling people?

Please, do go on & don't forget the updates \ud83c\udf7f\ud83e\udd23", "ESH because this was unnecessary. Why did you have to bring your husband to a place where he would interact with your dad and brother in public? Why couldn't you invite your aunt out to show your husband to her alone? Or is she so insignificant to your lives that you don't have one-on-one time with her? If that's the case, why does it matter that she thinks you're divorced? That's her own fault. Don't bring your husband into an uncomfortable position just to one-up someone who's not involved in your marriage.\n\nAnd your brother is an asshole for starting something after he promised to behave. You need to set boundaries with him to not disrespect your husband if he wants to be in your life.", "NTA Does your family follow a strict religious code that prohibits human contact in the view of others? Your brother also sounds disturbingly jealous if he considers this \"watching someone grope his sister\"", "I mean what you describe seems like normal PDA that married couples do, but saying your husband thinks it's fun to get under your brother's skin makes me think he's kind of an asshole. Unless your brother and dad did something super bad to him, anyone that enjoys antagonizing others isn't someone I'd like to be around so I understand them not wanting your husband there.\n\n NTA for doing normal couples stuff but again unless something major happened I understand them not wanting your husband around.", "YTA- GROW UP. No one consented to your soft porn show and yes, if they know you have relationship issues and they haven\u2019t seen him in 3 YEARS it\u2019s very reasonable to assume you got a divorce. People are trying to eat and you are getting groped right in front of their salads.", "YTA.  You put your husband in a horrible situation.  You need to figure out where your loyalties lie.  I'll give you a hint:  A great deal of the trouble in your marriage probably came from the fact that you let your family disrespect your husband.\n\nSo what that your aunt ran her mouth?  What does she know about your marriage?  Not much apparently.  Rather than dragging your husband into that mess (that he only went to in order to support you - because that's what spouses do, support each other), you should have smiled sweetly and said \"Really, Aunt\\_\\_\\_?  When did I get divorced?  Because, honestly, I don't remember doing that.  Divorces are a matter of public record in \\[County you live in\\].  Would you please print out a copy of my divorce decree for me?  Until I have proof of a divorce, I'm still married.\"\n\nBetter yet, call a family meeting.  You can do it over Zoom so your husband doesn't have to be in the same room with your family.  It needs to be a very one-sided discussion.  All you need to say is \"DH and I are happily married.  The only time we are unhappy is when you get involved.  As a result, we are no longer going to interact with you.  DH isn't interacting with you.  I'm not interacting with.
