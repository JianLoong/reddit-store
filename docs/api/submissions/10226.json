Were you holding hands or licking chocolate sauce from dessert off each others neck?", "In my many years of being alive i always notice that the couple that has the grope eachother during dinner does not have a stable relationship. If you feel the need to mark your territory, then something is off. Weird that your family has not seen him in 3 years, and odd that they don't just ask if you are divorced. ESH , just all stay away from eachother, and everyone wins.", "Info:\n\nWhat does \"being all over him\" mean? Don't tell me you had your tongues down eachothers throats and were groping at eachothers private parts just to prove a point.", "ESH, just bad planning on your part. Also, figure out why the aunt thought you were divorced good chance someone told her that\n\nNo family member want to see PDA at dinner", "INFO: Why dont your husband and family like each other?", "ESH. There are better ways to 'prove' your relationship than PDA. Since your brother said something about groping I assume it's not just you being extra nice to your husband to set an example.\n\nAnd obviously, your aunt is way out of line being a busybody about your relationship.", "YTA. You deliberately put your husband in a situation you knew he didn't want to be in, & opened him up for more hurt, just to prove a point to your aunt. Who cares what your aunt thinks? Mildly annoying, sure, but you had a far easier solution - **just stop going**", "INFO - How affectionate, as you put it, were you being? It is definitely inappropriate in most families to be groping each other at the dinner table.", "ESH\u2014 you put your husband in an uncomfortable situation because of something that annoyed you, but your family are also a bag of d***s. Only non-AH here is your hubs", "YTA - You engineered this fiasco to prove a point. Your husband didn't want to go, and your family didn't want that either, but everyone accommodated your wishes. Then you amped up the PDA, knowing it would elicit a reaction. \n\nBeyond that, you have some stuff to work through. \n\nAs long as the two of you are happy with the relationship, stop worrying about what your family thinks about your marriage. Their negativity is only going to hurt you. \n\nIf your husband is overly controlling (notice that he was the one touching you at dinner, not the other way around), maybe your family is picking up on unhealthy elements of your marriage. It's fair to remember that they've loved you since you were a child.\n\nYou probably can't have it both ways.", "ESH, all of you...\n\n>I didn\u2019t actually realise she thought I was divorced until she told my cousin she would be divorced at 25 like me if she didn\u2019t wait until they were older to marry her fianc\u00e9. \n\n>she refused to believe I was still married,\n\n>During the dinner I could tell he didn\u2019t want to be there\n\n>he was being a lot more touchy than normal\n\n>I was being more affectionate to show I appreciated him coming and to prove a point to my aunt.\n\n>my brother rudely asked me if I had to be all over him and that he didn\u2019t need to see some jackass grope his little sister.\n\nAll of you.

I can't imagine treating someone they way your family treated your husband, but I also can't imagine participating in even a little bit of PDA in front of my parents and siblings.", "Kinda YtA for your husband for taking him to that toxic environment", "YTA. You pressured your husband to go to a dinner he didn't want to be at in the first place. And then you used him to show off to your family with PDA that probably made everyone uncomfortable. Your insecurity should not be put on other people like that.", "ESH. Obviously wrong of your aunt to make assumptions, and your dad/brother for starting shit with your husband. With that said, why did you decide to engage in your aunt's drama and beg your husband to go to something he would not enjoy just to unnecessarily prove a point?! Why do you feel the need to make that point? You shouldn't have to prove anything to anyone, her opinion shouldn't hold that kind of weight. And look where it got you- drama ensued, you and your husband did not have an enjoyable time, and gonna go out on a whim here and say nobody's opinion of your husband/marriage changed.", "INFO: why does your family hate your husband that much? pretty bizarre the way your brother talk about you", "YTA. PDA is uncomfortable and rude for everybody else.", "YTA work on your marriage instead trying to embarrass your aunt. Really, this show, just proved her point.", "If you were going over the top with public displays of affection (like making out at the dinner table) I\u2019d say yeah, YTA.  Of course, Aunt is also an AH.  Your brother may be too depending on how aggressive you were getting.", "ESH. \n\nYour family shouldn't have done that, and neither should you. I feel bad for your poor husband being in the middle! You had the chance to take the high road.  Your husband and your brother have a bad relationship, and you're stoking the flame..", "YTA. Why do you care what anyone thinks, grow up, there was no need for this just for point scoring.", "ESH except the husband here. You brought him to a place where he surely wouldn't be welcome and your family just treats him pretty bad.", "ESH but I think you seem to suck less than the rest of your family. Depending on exactly how all over him you were, that changes things a bit (how in-your-face you were trying to be). But overall it just seems like an overall toxic family environment that has gotten you too, and you put your husband in a very uncomfortable environment to prove someone wrong.", "INFO: I get why your husband doesn't attend. Buy why do you attend?", "Depends on what exactly you did during that dinner. If you were appropriate, just touchy-feely, then you are NTA. \n\nBut your aunt actually is.", "YTA\n\nThe only point you proved is that you can be tacky at a family event.", "INFO: What hubs think? Like, is this a plus good? I can see more PDA being something that could help y'all if this is family you are from.", "NTA.  But your family surely is.", "ESA you shouldn\u2019t have forced your husband to stay but also your aunt stepped over the Line by saying that you 2 were divorced", "NTA for essentially reciprocating your husband's affection. I wouldn't call responding to him being a little more hands on \"all over him\". However it sounds like you need to discuss with your family how they treat your husband and make them aware that you're on his side and the toxic way they treat him isn't going to be tolerated.", "You call that groping???? Watch *this*", "NTA.\n\nEveryone's hating on you without really explaining or realizing that people suck and relationships are work. You have to talk with your husband and clear some anxieties.\n\nWith my gf I check in when I know she's anxious or doing an anxious activity and if she's upset in anyway I tell her we will leave.\n\nTry reading the \"5 love languages\" by Gary Chapman it'll change your life.\n\nHe's your soulmate.

The couple groping each other is always the couple that is falling apart behind closed doors. Most likely people are saying \u201cdid you see them grabbing at each other?? Their marriage must really be on the brink.\u201d You basically just confirmed all the suspicions that your marriage is in shambles. I mean, the first time your husband has shown his face in front of extended family in years and he still gets into a fight with your dad and brother because he won\u2019t get his hands off your thighs and waist in front of them?? Yeah I would also be betting against you if I was your aunt.", "ESH", "We were sitting super close to each other, hugged a few times and my husband had his hand around my waist or on my thigh a lot. When my brother called us out my husband was hugging me from behind and his hands were on my stomach so nothing super inappropriate.", "I read that as pointing to each others private parts and now I can't stop laughing at the visual \ud83d\ude06 \ud83d\ude02", "They might not like anyone making out at their dinner table, i would not. I asume rocky start is the reason they also don't like him.", "since he likes to piss her brother off, i think even he is prob an AH.", "I would agree with the level of affection being displayed. If you're grinding on the table in front of your family then yeah YTA. If it's hand holding, arm touching or anything a reasonable person would consider socially acceptable then your family is absolutely out of line.", "Op commented this under someone else:\n\n\u201cWe were sitting super close to each other, hugged a few times and my husband had his hand around my waist or on my thigh a lot. When my brother called us out my husband was hugging me from behind and his hands were on my stomach so nothing super inappropriate.\u201d", "My husband found it funny but that's mostly because he likes getting under my brother's skin.", "OK NTA then, that's normal levels of affection between a couple", "Look we both have working junk!", "YTA.  You set your husband up to be the punching bag of the family and you're wondering why it didn't work out?  C'mon man.  How ELSE was this going to go?  At least your husband tried to go to make you happy.  That's the only NON-AH thing about this.", "YTA who cares what your aunt is telling people? Her believing your married or not doesn\u2019t matter as you are in fact married. You forced your husband into an uncomfortable situation to prove that your married to an aunt who seems to be a drama queen.", "ESH. Who TF cares what someone else thinks especially if the truth is evident? Your show would have made me laugh and would have made me believe there were problems. Your aunt needs to stop being a busy body but you're definitely the one that is worse here.", "This is the trashiest shit I've ever heard! Please, do go on & don't forget the updates \ud83c\udf7f\ud83e\udd23", "ESH because this was unnecessary. Why did you have to bring your husband to a place where he would interact with your dad and brother in public? Why couldn't you invite your aunt out to show your husband to her alone? Or is she so insignificant to your lives that you don't have one-on-one time with her? If that's the case, why does it matter that she thinks you're divorced? That's her own fault. Don't bring your husband into an uncomfortable position just to one-up someone who's not involved in your marriage.\n\nAnd your brother is an asshole for starting something after he promised to behave. You need to set boundaries with him to not disrespect your husband if he wants to be in your life.", "NTA Does your family follow a strict religious code that prohibits human contact in the view of others? Your brother also sounds disturbingly jealous if he considers this \"watching someone grope his sister\"", "I mean what you describe seems like normal PDA that married couples do, but saying your husband thinks it's fun to get under your brother's skin makes me think he's kind of an asshole. Unless your brother and dad did something super bad to him, anyone that enjoys antagonizing others isn't someone I'd like to be around so I understand them not wanting your husband there.\n\n NTA for doing normal couples stuff but again unless something major happened I understand them not wanting your husband around.", "YTA- GROW UP. No one consented to your soft porn show and yes, if they know you have relationship issues and they haven\u2019t seen him in 3 YEARS it\u2019s very reasonable to assume you got a divorce. People are trying to eat and you are getting groped right in front of their salads.", "YTA.  You put your husband in a horrible situation.  You need to figure out where your loyalties lie.  I'll give you a hint:  A great deal of the trouble in your marriage probably came from the fact that you let your family disrespect your husband.\n\nSo what that your aunt ran her mouth?  What does she know about your marriage?  Not much apparently.  Rather than dragging your husband into that mess (that he only went to in order to support you - because that's what spouses do, support each other), you should have smiled sweetly and said \"Really, Aunt\\_\\_\\_?  When did I get divorced?  Because, honestly, I don't remember doing that.  Divorces are a matter of public record in \\[County you live in\\].  Would you please print out a copy of my divorce decree for me?  Until I have proof of a divorce, I'm still married.\"\n\nBetter yet, call a family meeting.  You can do it over Zoom so your husband doesn't have to be in the same room with your family.  It needs to be a very one-sided discussion.  All you need to say is \"DH and I are happily married.  The only time we are unhappy is when you get involved.  As a result, we are no longer going to interact with you.  DH isn't interacting with you.  I'm not interacting with.  I'm no longer going to put up with you being rude and disrespectful to my husband and my marriage.  Goodbye.\"", "save your marriage, dump your family.", "Uhm.   I wouldn\u2019t want to go either.", "Eh, ESH. I'm more concerned about WHY you forced him to be there and why you're still hanging out with those people when they don't like your husband and he doesn't like them.", "ESH.   This is beyond ridiculous.", "I don't want to blame you, but you have to admit, either your aunt has early dementia or she played you like a fiddle.", "The whole lot of you sound dysfunctional.", "Maybe? In total, that can be a lot (versus like \"I usually sit with my hands on my partner's thigh and they tend to touch my shoulder or sneak a kiss when they pass me.\""]}
