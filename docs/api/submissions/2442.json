I love her dog, so I\u2019m usually happy to watch it when she\u2019s away. \n\nSome context: I have a job where everyone works in the office Monday through Wednesday, and at home Thursday and Friday. Kate was planning to come back on Tuesday. So I would have to come home early on Monday to let the dog out, but not on Tuesday, since Kate would be getting home. \n\nOn Sunday night, Kate texted me and asked if I would mind if she stayed until Wednesday. While it would be a bit inconvenient to leave work early both Monday and Tuesday, I told her I thought I could make it work. But after sleeping on it, I realized I also had to leave work early for a doctors appointment on Wednesday, so that would be all three \u201cin-office\u201d days this week I would be leaving early. I should also note, I had been working from home full time for the last two weeks because I was watching my parents\u2019 dog while they were out of town. So I felt like I really needed to put in time in the office this week to show I wasn\u2019t slacking. So I told her that actually if she could come back as planned on Tuesday that would be much easier for me (and explained about work).\n\nKate agreed to come home as planned on Tuesday, but she was curt in her text and I could sense she was annoyed at me. Sure enough, when I got home today and asked her how her trip was, she said \u201cGood. I mean, I wish I could have stayed longer\u201d in a passive aggressive tone, then went back in her room. \n\nAm I the asshole here? All I did was request that she stick to our original plan. I was doing her a favor by watching her dog, and when she asked if I could do it longer than agreed, it was inconvenient for me so I said so. I\u2019m usually a huge people pleaser, so I was proud of myself for drawing a boundary. But after her reaction I\u2019m second-guessing whether I\u2019m actually the asshole.", "created_utc": 1668575944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywkp2f/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_come_home_as/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were doing her a favor. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask her to stick to the plan for the sake of your work performance. \n\nI think she was just a little annoyed you said yes to watching the dog till Wednesday and then rescinded the offer, regardless of your reasons for doing so. She probably just needs time to cool off. Give her space for a few days.", "NTA. Having a pet comes with accepting responsibility for that pet. I sure hope your roommate never has children if she cannot even manage the responsibility of a dog.", "Nta, if she wanted to be able to change her plans like that then she could have paid someone or taken the dog to a boarding kennel. You were doing her a favour and she changed the plan last minute, not your fault she didn't plan responsibly.", "NTA. You can\u2019t pause your life because Kate wants to stay later on her trip. You were doing her a favor by watching the dog. The least she can do is come back on time.", "NTA. Next time she could take her dog with her and stay however long she wants?\n\nI love dogs, but she doesn't get to be angry when you were doing her a favor in the first place. She should be thankful.", "NTA You were already doing her a favor, for which she should be grateful for. She probably was just riding that high of getting to extend her trip and then got majorly bummed when she saw your text in the AM, thus not being able to stay longer. \n\nI would honestly just talk to her. Since you are friends and live together, sometimes it\u2019s best to just smooth things over and say your peace so you can both move on from it. You could say something like, \u201chey, I know it was a bummer to not be able to extend your trip. When I said yes to the extra day I had a lot on my mind and I wasn\u2019t thinking about the repercussions at work or my prior commitments. I just want you to know that it wasn\u2019t my intention to put a damper on your trip. I hope you can understand why I had to go back on agreeing to the extra day. I love (insert dog name here), and I\u2019m happy I can help watch her for you when you travel. Just in case you run into this situation again, maybe you could find a dog walker in the area who can step in occasionally if plans change last minute when I\u2019m not available. I\u2019m sure one of the neighbors has a great recommendation.\u201d", "NAH - I think you\u2019re reading too much into it. She asked, you said you\u2019d prefer she came home as planned, she did. She\u2019d be an AH if she hadn\u2019t, but she is entitled to feel upset about having to come back sooner than she\u2019d like, without her being an AH. But you\u2019re not an AH for asking her to do so either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She could've arranged for another friend to pick the dog up from you and keep it an extra day. You're not her on-call dog sitter. This is absolutely not on you.", "NTA and I think you both should talk about this. It is good practice to talk about things that seem to be off, instead of letting it build up. She may be annoyed about not staying longer but she has to understand your side, which is a valid point. Plans change and you both will have to face numerous changes in life. She may bring up how you could take days off e prior week but not when she needed you. Sometimes your job does not allow the flexibility you need and if you had to choose, work comes first because bills have to be paid. She has to also understand that the prior weeks schedule affected this week\u2019s flexibility.", "NTA\n\nLet her be annoyed.  Why do people try to protect everyone from having emotions?\n\nYou couldn't take care of her dog.  She wanted to stay longer.  The dog is her responsibility. She came home and did her duty.

You told her \"yes\" and presumably she made plans based on that which she then had to cancel.  It would have been fine to tell her \"no\" in the first place, but you didn't so \"as planned\" became Wednesday rather than Tuesday and then you asked her to come back early.", "she had no right to be passive aggressive, but you need to understand that you said you could, then you backed out the next day. maybe in future, double check your schedule before making a promise you\u2019re not sure you can keep.\n\nsoft ESH"]}
