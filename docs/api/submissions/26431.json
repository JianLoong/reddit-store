In order to \"go there,\" it could only be with someone who cared about my feelings way more than they ever cared about trying to pressure me into sexual activities.

They tell me they'll still hook up with me though as if that's some kind of prize.\n\nI told one of them I accepted his view that I wasn't young enough to have a relationship with, since he had younger options. I told him that unfortunately, he wasn't hot enough for me to hook up with. Since I have much hotter options than him, that's who I would choose if I ever were to do that. It wouldn't be worth it at all if it were him. I would most likely do it for Momoa, not him.

NTA.", "Don't worry, I'm not settling for anything. I had fully accepted I would be single for the rest of my life at the age of 29, and the thought was actually a relief. In fact, back then, the thought of being single for the rest of my life felt like a reprieve from a lifetime prison sentence.\n\nI've come a long way but my life is one of very deep peace. There's no way I would disturb that for anyone who is not coming correct.", "Yes. I don't think they understand the reality of the situation, since in their view, I'm not a very \"desirable\" woman. They don't understand that almost all single men are willing to hook up with almost all halfway decent women. Even 4's and 5's can hook up with male 10's if they are willing to accept it will ONLY be for sex and maybe also a secret.\n\nAnother thing I discovered is something I was not expecting at all. When I was on these apps in my 20's, all kinds of older men lied about their age, saying they were younger. Now, there are even more younger guys lying about their age, saying they are older, to get around your age parameters and trick you into matching with them!! Almost all the guys like this are purely sexually motivated. I understand older woman/younger male has become a popular porn category. My interested in these guys could not possibly be lower. But I don't think the 40-45 year old guy, who very much looks his age, understands that I get more hookup requests from the 22-25 year old range than from his age range.", "Good on you for getting out of that marriage and achieving your goals.", "I\u2019m not surprised.  \n\nOlder men want to find a young attractive woman to marry, but they realize she wants someone similar in age.  So they lie to get a first date, hoping she will forgive him once they\u2019re dating.  \n\nThe younger dudes are just looking for sex, they want to avoid women their age who are looking for an LTR and focus on women who may be up for a fling.\n\nI know you\u2019re looking for an LTR, but while you\u2019re waiting for a good guy, you could always find a nice Jason Momoa-esque 20-something for a fun night \ud83d\ude09"]}
