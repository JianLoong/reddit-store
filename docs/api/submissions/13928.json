Together they had 2 daughters. My brother wanted B to become a stay-at-home mom to their two kids. B worked part-time for a while which my brother claimed caused him a lot of \"mental stress\" because he would have to care for the kids occasionally. I have always been close to B, she even introduced me to my future husband (her little brother). She has always been a super kind and genuine person. B and I have been best friends since we met in middle school.\n\nEventually, B quit her job and became a SAHM. After B began staying home full-time P began going on \"business trips\" for weeks at a time, including making B go to her dad's funeral alone with the kids because he had an important business trip that weekend. B later discovered my brother was sleeping with another woman Z(23f).\n\nAfter she found this out my brother drained their shared bank account and moved in with Z. After the divorce B was left with 2 young kids and no money. Throughout all of this, my brother has been completely useless and downright horrible to B. Because he wanted a fast divorce since Z was pregnant and they wanted to get married.\n\nTwo weeks ago P invited me to his and Z's backyard wedding. The date it was set for was April 2nd and he constantly called me begging for me to come as he wanted me to be a part of his wedding.\n\nI told P I have no intentions of going after I first hand witnessed how poorly he treated B. P said that I don't understand what it's like to be married so young and not get to experience the \"fun years.\" And that I'm being unfair and choosing B over my own blood. He emphasized over and over again that at the end of the day, he is all I have and spouses come and go.\n\nWell, I ended up skipping the wedding. My Husband said he didn't care if I went but he wasn't going to go no matter what. B also said she didn't care if I went because P is still my brother. But my parents have been calling me selfish and saying that I have backstabbed the family by not supporting my brother. They also said I needed to suck it up and just be supportive of P. P refuses to talk to me but his new wife Z has been messaging me on social media saying Im a huge asshole and should feel sorry for myself for picking his ex over P.\n\nI feel like an asshole now. I know what he did was horrible but I can't look P in the eyes knowing what he did to B. I really don't know if I'm being unreasonable in this situation.
