He has autism, which doesn't bother me at all because I have several autistic friends who are fun to hang around. However, he makes me and several other female students feel uncomfortable.\n\nHe calls us his sweetiepies, and asks to see our bellybuttons, which is weird, and he said to one of my friends that her boobs were perfect (weird). Word on the street is he got expelled from his last school for treating girls with disrespect. He tries to talk to me and my best friend V. V and I never enjoy talking to John, and all of our conversations with him end badly. It's even gotten to the point where John is following my 11 year old sister around school, and I told him to leave her alone.\n\nWhen my dad drops us off in the morning, one time, John came up to the window to my car and started talking to my dad, I told him just to drive away and he did.\n\nFast foward to last night, we had a choir concert. We all did good, and at the end I was talking to V, and John and his parents come up to us and John starts talking to us. I give V \"the look\" (if u have a bestie yall know what I mean lmaooo) to walk away so we start to retreat to the bathroom. As we start to turn around and walk to the bathroom his mother says \"Where are you guys going? John was talking to you.\" V says \"Oh I gotta pee real bad.\" and we went to the bathroom.\n\n5 minutes later, we come out of the bathroom and we try to sneak past them, when John tries to speak to us again and we keep walking. Now John's father says \"Do you guys not have any manners? My son was talking to you.\" I then decide I had to be honest and I say:\n\n\"Do you know how your son acts? He goes around making me and my friends uncomfortable by talking about our bellybuttons and saying our boobs are perfect. Give him a lesson on respect and maybe he would have more friends.\"\n\nHis mother, in shock, retorts with\n\n\"Well, John has autism, so it's hard for him to read social cues. However, this is no excuse for him to be treated this way.\"\n\nI then boldly say:\n\n\"I don't give two flying fucks about any of that. It's no excuse. Tell him to treat women with respect, and to stop talking to me, and asking for my number/social medias. Good night.\" Me and V storm out.\n\nEveryone watching says I was being too mean, but I think I handled it well.\n\nAita for not wanting to be friends with him?", "created_utc": 1682042433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tmuge/aita_for_not_liking_an_autistic_classmate/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The parents made this confrontational, not you. (They are doing their son a massive disservice, not you!) You guys left and disengaged and they kept pushing so you answered. You aren\u2019t obligated to be harassed for the comfort of anyone. Ever. I wish I\u2019d understood how to stick up for myself at your age, especially like that.", "NTA. Being autistic has nothing to do with being gross. This is NOT a social cue thing- this guy has clearly had his ignorant parents using his autism as an excuse for his grim behaviour. Report the kid's behaviour to the school honestly and well done for not letting his awful parents manipulate you into an uncomfortable and most of all POTENTIALLY UNSAFE friendship.", "Nta. His parents need to do a better job.", "Absolutely NTA! Too many parents have used \"my child has autism\" as an excuse for taking care of them, correcting their behaviour and getting them help when they need it...being the way he is to you guys has nothing to do with being autistic and his parents not dealing with it is going to make him grow to be the weird creepy guy that's mentally unstable instead of the weird guy that's friendly. I feel you handled it perfectly and would be proud of my daughter if she told me that she stood up for herself and her friends like you did. If people went back to calling things out like they are vs trying to not offend someone, we'd have a lot less problems.", "Extremely NTA. As someone who dealt with this same situation in hs from an autistic kid, it doesn't matter if he's autistic, his behavior is inappropriate and he should be punished like any other kid for his actions. Autism is not an excuse and never justifies actions like this, especially when the school and parents keep letting it happen. You could argue that some autistic people genuinely cannot tell right from wrong-which is true in some cases- but the people taking care of them and monitoring them sure as hell do, and there's no excuse for them either", "INFO: You didn't tell them to make John stay away from your sister?", "Delete my first comment because I misread the mother's reply to you.\n\nNTA, although \"handled it well\" might be a bit of stretch. You honestly weren't in a good position to handle it well and pressed into a less than optimal way to handle the matter, so not rly your fault.", "NTA. Nothing you said was untrue or insulting. You\u2019re not obligated to stay in conversations where you\u2019re uncomfortable, and his parents are doing him a disservice by not teaching him to leave people alone when they walk away from him because one of these times someone is going to call the police or security on him. Autistic people with higher support needs, like many disabled people, often have problems with police brutality.\n\nIt also sounds like John needs more support on learning social skills than he currently is, and I hope that\u2019s being worked into his IEP.", "As a person on the spectrum NTA. Autism doesn't excuse sexual harassment ever. His parents are teaching John to use his autism as an excuse to get away with horrible behaviour. Autistic people might struggle with social clues, but we can still learn.

AT ALL\nI was a mother to a Autistic teen, now young (21 yo) man.   We knew that he would need direction with social cues. So we taught him to ask for our wants and our needs.  He always asked before touching anyone in any way.  We went over appropriate speech and how to tell facial expressions. He can usally spot \"oh I screwed up\" face and redirect himself. All this culminated with his first girlfriend when he was 14.  After a couple of weeks I got a phone call from a very angery mother yelling about my deviant son.  Aparently He wanted to get to second base and asked for his wants... She said no and he didnt do it... this mom was upset that he had asked.  I know that teaching approprite behaviour is possable. \n\nNow a bit of backstory I went to school with this woman and her oldest was born when she was 15.... so....", "Nta you should kill their whole family", "Deleted first comment because I completely missed the part about your sister too.\n\nNah OP. Autism doesn't give someone a pass for having creepy and sexually harassing people. That's just not okay. \n\nYa did good.", "NTA You stood up for yourself and your friends and handled that situation very well!!", "NTA.  Autism doesn\u2019t make you a sexual harasser. He learned it from somewhere. One would think his parents would be concerned, given that he was expelled previously because of that; however, it sounds like they excuse everything with autism. If they don\u2019t work to stop this behavior now, it could escalate", "NTA\n\nEven if John \"can't help it\" that doesn't mean you have to put up with it. You've expressed that he makes you uncomfortable and he hasn't stopped. The next logical step is to remove yourself from the situation.\n\nI understand his mother's desire to protect her son from alienation, but the fact that she's completely disregarding the fact that John makes his female classmates uncomfortable is not okay. Autism *might* explain his behavior (I doubt it), but his behavior is why you avoid him, not his autism. If someone had a tic that made them thrust their right elbow out to the side, no one would be calling you ableist for not sitting directly to their right. Sure they can't help it, but why would anyone who knows about it be in elbow throwing range?", "NTA, these parents use their son's diagnostic as an excuse for his behaviour and play the victim when they get called out. I don't think you were too mean. Maybe it was something they needed to hear. Being on the spectrum, depending on the severity, doesn't mean he is unable to learn what is and is not appropriate to say/do.", "Quite often the result of women feeling obligated to be polite or nice about people like this ends in something much worse that doesn't come to light until it's too late because being understanding and nice undermined their safety until there was none.", "This is what I came here to say. It's fine that John can't read social cues. It's not fine that his parents haven't taught him that bellybuttons and boobs are off limits for conversation. It's *really* not fine that they would expect anyone to accept sexual harassment to make their lives easier. Just because he can't read a room, doesn't mean he can't learn right from wrong.\n\nOP should make sure her parents know that she's being harassed by another student and that the students parents tried to force her to accommodate her harasser. If John's parents ever try to speak to OP again she should refuse unless her own parents are present. \n\nYour own safety and autonomy outweighs any diagnosis given to another person.", "sexual assault needs to be gunned down expeditiously. regardless of anything.", "Nah you're right.
