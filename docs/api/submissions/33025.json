{"id": 33025, "submission_id": "18igpg5", "title": "AITA For cancelling the babysitter after my wife decided not to attend my work holiday party", "selftext": "My (38M) work held our annual holiday party last Friday.  It was held at one of those axe-throwing places which I had never done before so I figured it would be pretty fun.  My wife (36F) and I have 3 kids (10, 8, & 5) so we don't get out of the house for dates very often.  The holiday party was planned almost 2 months ago and my wife agreed to attend with me.  I suggested we make it more of a \"date\" by either going out for drinks after the party or catching a late-night movie.  She thought this was a good idea too. I also arranged for a babysitter to come watch the kids for that night.\n\nThe day of the party, my wife got home from work and told me that she had a horrible day and was in a bad space mentally so she didn't want to come to the party.  I told her I was disappointed, but I understand if she wants to stay home.  As I was getting myself ready to head to the party, I called the babysitter and cancelled.  I apologized to her and offered to Venmo her an hours worth of our agreed rate ($30) to compensate for the cancellation and she agreed that was reasonable.\n\nAs I was getting ready to leave, my wife asked when the babysitter was going to come.  I kind of looked at her funny and told her I had just cancelled the babysitter because she was no longer coming with me.  She got mad at me and told me that I knew she had a bad day and was in a bad mental state and needed some time to herself.  I told her that I had assumed none of that meant she was incapable of watching our kids and that I didn't think having the babysitter come when my wife was still home made any sense at all.\n\nShe told me to call her back and see if she could still come watch the kids and I told her that if she wanted to do that she can do it, but I'm not going to.  She tried to argue with me about it, but I told her that I had to leave for the party.  While I was at the party, she sent me multiple texts about how the kids were driving her nuts and that the babysitter didn't answer her calls and she needed me to come home.\n\nShe kept blowing up my phone and I eventually left the party over an hour early to go home.  When I got there, she kept arguing with me about how I was an AH for cancelling the babysitter when I knew she had a rough day. I told her I was not going to pay a babysitter just so that my wife can rest after a bad day.  I told her she could have just thrown a movie on for the kids and relaxed.  I told her she was the one who ruined our potential night out and that having a bad day at work is not a good enough reason to pay a babysitter $150-200.\n\nShe still thinks I was an AH for cancelling the babysitter without talking to her first and she's still mad at me for it.  But I don't think that was an unreasonable assumption to make considering that there have been plenty of times when I've had a bad day and I am still 100% capable of watching the kids by myself while my wife leaves the house.\n\nEDIT:  Hey everyone, can we cool it with the purely speculative cheating angle?  My wife goes to yoga class with 5 other moms from our neighborhood.  So, unless they are all stepping out on their husbands or all in cahoots together, she's not cheating.  Our neighborhood isn't a reality TV show and real life isn't like that.  She's an introvert and when she gets to her social limit, she doesn't want to go out. It's happened before which is why I didn't push her to come out with me.

No sane persons going to spend $200 for a babysitter when a parent is actually home. She didn't have to take care of the kids. Based on their ages she could have made it a movie night or put their favorite shows on while she relaxed. My guess is she had other plans she didn't want you to know about and got upset because you canceled the babysitter which is super reasonable thing to do since she's staying home. The fact she got so heated about it is odd. Who makes plans for a date night at a work party  then decide last minute not to go because they had a bad day , that's pretty rude. The fact she just assumed you'd keep the babysitter despite your plans changing is weird and should be talked about.", "For all the parents and/or folks who aren't independently wealthy, responding Y T A, please ask yourself this: \"When was the last time, after having a rough day at work, you decided that was a good reason to spend $150 - $200 on a babysitter, so you could stay home with your kids & the sitter?\" What? NEVER? Then STFU. Of course OP - the person who made all the arrangements for their long planned and much anticipated date - cancelled the sitter, because he hired her based on the fact that no parent was going to be home with the kids. Now that one of the kids' parents was going to be home - and never suggested they needed the help a sitter with their own children - why on earth would he throw away $150 min? That cash can be put towards a sitter when they are BOTH able to go out!  NTA.", "NTA. Why pay for a babysitter if she's home. They're old enough to entertain themselves. If mom says \"guys I'm too tired to be running around tonight dealing with messes. If I order pizza and put a movie on, you have to promise to be quiet and leave me alone\"\n\nBasically, she's allowed to act like an adult and reason with her kids. 200$ for a babysitter and she has the guts to bitch at you when SHE canceled something you were looking forward to...last minute?\n\nShe's TA.", "NTA. I know zero parents that get a $200/night babysitter for a bad day. \n\nSource: I\u2019m a parent that knows lots of parents.", "NTA.  Seems odd that she's so upset over you cancelling the babysitter.  Sounds like she made other plans that got derailed when she had to stay home with the kids.", "What puts it into NTA for me is the fact that you are able to watch them when you have bad days. How often do you have date nights or time by yourself and herself respectively", "As a working mom of 3 I\u2019m firmly saying NTA. There is no need for a babysitter just for being in a crappy mood. You are more than capable of watching the kids. If you\u2019re that miserable, just stick them in front of a movie with a treat. My kids are younger and I\u2019d never expect to cancel a planned night and still get the sitter.", "To all the people calling the OP an AH. I have personally never heard of anyone hiring a baby sitter while they were home because they had a bad day at work. Is this something people do?", "NTA\nI had terrible days at work. That did not mean I needed a day off from my children and spouse. If that was your wife\u2019s expectation, she should have clarified herself and articulated clearly her expectations and needs.", "NTA, I think wife was looking for an excuse to get out of the party and have down time. It\u2019s just extremely convenient she had this terrible day on what was suppose to be a date night but instead wanted to stay home and still hire the babysitter. BUT if you love your wife and value your relationship you need to talk to her about actually getting some down time in without needing to play games. You need to make it a reality and vice versa.", "NTA\n\nShe should have told you to keep the baby sitter.  She made the poor assumption.  Further, if she wanted to stay home and relax, she could pay the sitter herself.  This is a problem she caused herself.", "NTA. Why spend money on a babysitter when one of you are home. Her work day was over so it was time to leave it at work. Personally I think she should have gone with you to your party. I would have taken her mind off the day and made things better", "NTA. At those kids ages, his wife could have chucked on a movie, ordered pizza, and everyone could have a relaxing, stress free evening. He had been looking forward to this evening for a couple of months, and I think it was unfair for her to derail the whole thing just because she'd had a bad day. That being said, I think he should have mentioned to the wife that he was cancelling the babysitter. But given she was going to be at home anyway, that would have been a very expensive luxury unless she was seriously ill.", "NTA. I can understand having a bad day. My kids are 8 & 9 and things can sometimes get crazy but also, in other instances, ordering pizza and cuddling on the couch takes away all that stress from my day and actually improves my mental state. Also, I would feel incredibly uncomfortable if I had a sitter there to watch my kids while I relaxed in my room. I can see that she was frustrated when it initially happened but I don\u2019t understand her continuing to be angry about it\u2026in the morning she would have had to realize that her frustration and anger were due to her bad day and not you cancelling the sitter. Maybe just explain to her that you were looking forward to a date night and reschedule for another night when you both are ready. It seems important that you still do the date night together.", "NTA \n\nShe made other plans and you just messed them up.", "NTA. If she wanted the sitter to still come, she should have explicitly stated that. You made the reasonable assumption that if one parent is staying home, then a sitter is no longer necessary. I have a feeling if roles were reversed here there\u2019d be a lot fewer redditors calling you an AH.", "NTA. As a mom I feel like I can't just check out bc I'm having a bad day. $200 could buy us groceries for a week and would feel wasteful. Having you leave early is super selfish on her part.", "NTA. Who in their right mind would pay to have someone watch their kids for the night when all you need to do is throw on a movie and then put them to bed like every other night. The wife is being unreasonable", "NTA.\nBUT, you probably could have thrown a \u201cSo I\u2019m going to cancel the babysitter\u201d communication in there instead of just doing it.\n(Although there\u2019s a chance that would have just started the \u201cI\u2019ve had a bad day, so I want to keep the babysitter\u201d argument earlier\u2026)", "NTA.   She needs to grow up. Or at the very least communicate better.  I mean lets be honest if the roles were reversed and the husband was begging off the party and still expecting the wife to keep the babysitter so he could decompress 100% would think he was an AH", "NTA. Her having a bad day at work doesn\u2019t mean you need to waste $150-$200 so she can not parent your shared children for the evening.", "NTA. Being a parent is hard. Even when you have a bad day, you still have to take care of the kids. Spending $150-200 on a babysitter while one parent is home is ridiculous. \n\nIMO, a \u201chard day\u201d at work isn\u2019t a good enough excuse to bail on a date night with your spouse. Hell, if I\u2019ve had a hard day at work, I\u2019d be thrilled to come home and have a date with my wife while somebody else watched the kids. She makes me feel better than any other person could.", "NTA. It wouldn't have even occurred to me to consider keeping the babysitter knowing there was going to be an adult at home. And as a babysitter, I would find the fact that there was still a parent home incredibly awkward. When I was a teenager, babysitting was usually a dance party having, game playing, popcorn making, movie watching, loud time. Having a parent in the other room trying to rest would be such a horrible vibe.", "NTA\n\nWhile I do feel like you should have let her know you were going to cancel the babysitter, sometimes you just have to rally and do things you don't feel like doing.  \n\nYour wife is being a bit precious here throwing herself a pity party. This was supposed to be a date for you two, and while she may have viewed it as skipping out on the company party, it also was abandoning the date because she had a bad day.\n\nAdults should be able to regulate their emotions better than this. Put on your big boy pants, have a drink, and throw an ax.", "NTA\n\nBut I think that she\u2019d made alternate plans that you wrecked by cancelling the babysitter", "NTA. I would have assumed the same.", "NTA I really don't get how the people who say otherwise think parenting works. You were cool with her not going and went on your own.

If she wanted an off day she could've gone for drinks and a late night movie after a party... if only that was an option.", "So your wife, who had a rough day at work, made sure to ruin your fun by blowing up your phone. Your wife is in the wrong here and owes you an apology.", "No judgements here other than, couldn't you have least mentioned \"hey, I may as well cancel the sitter?\"", "NTA. A reasonable solution would be save the$150 plan to go out together when she feels better. \nIt actually might have been beneficial to her state of mind to go out, away from the kids, a little adult time with her husband. I just can't reconcile paying someone to watch my kids while I am home.", "Nta. What was she planning on doing when you left?", "NTA, especially based on OPs responses.\n\nThese e s h/y t a comments are absolutely wild.", "NTA\n\nCancelling the sitter was the logical thing to do.

Yours was a reasonable assumption.", "NTA.\n\nIt's reasonable to have a bad day at work and not be up for socializing or going out.  It's also reasonable to assume it would have been okay to cancel the babysitter since she would be home.  The onus is on her at that point to determine the day is so bad and she would still need help at home for the kids.", "NTA. Her reaction is sus. I agree with others, I think she had other plans and OP messed it up when he cancelled the babysitter. I'd be keeping my eyes peeled for other strange behaviour if I was OP.", "NTA.  You did not make an unreasonable assumption, she did by thinking the babysitter would not be cancelled. Basically if the babysitter was there the kids would still be bothering her with all they things they bothered her with because they are used to going to her, not the sitter.  It's a ridiculous expense compared to movies and pizza, as others have suggested.

She's TA.", "Wife and mom of 7 here - you are NTA imo. If your wife wanted to break from the kids then she needs to pay for it. Especially since she canceled her plans on you last minute. If I were you I'd be pretty pissed!", "NAH, and I feel like I might get a bit of disagreement about this.\n\nI think communication is the key issue here, and you and your wife would benefit from working on your communication patterns. I don't think you are the AH, because you didn't cancel in retaliation or to be difficult, but because you assumed it was the right thing to do. I don't know about your financial status, to comment on if the $150-200 is a large sum for your family or not, but understanding thinking this was not a good way to spend money. I assume you usually don't use a babysitter to recover after a bad day if your wife is unavailable to watch the kids. \n\nI also don't think your wife is the AH. I can imagine having a bad day, and not feeling like being social. Then thinking of a night to yourself, not being responsible for your kids either, and how great that thought may have been. Then learning that this dream is not happening, and you need to switch straight into parenting mode when you just don't have it in you. \n\nI think communication and empathy (from both of you) are what needs to be worked on. Remember that you are a team, not against each other. You shouldn't have minimised her bad day, and she shouldn't have blown up your phone, knowing you've been looking forward to this night for two months.", "NTA.

Since wife is home, babysitter isn't needed anymore", "NTA - to pay a sitter while she is at home is asinine", "Sounds like you ruined her night out alone and she got upset by that. So NTA.", "NTA\n\nI actually feel it is very unreasonable for her to expect you to keep a babysitter when she dissed you.  I have six kids, when they were little, I would have not missed a date night for anything, they were so rare.  If I had a bad day, I would have still gone to just get away and have a change of scenery.  Your wife texting you to come home early is even worse, so she ruined date night for you and her, and then she wanted to ruin your Christmas party for you also.  She is actually being selfish.", "NTA, when I used to babysit kids (20 years ago) if I had come over and one of the parents was still there id be like wtf is happening right now", "NTA. I do think you should've told her you were cancelling the babysitter, but the reasons for cancelling seems valid to me.", "NTA.

The kids either don't listen to you since Mom is in charge or Mom micromanages you.", "NTA but there was a clear communication disconnect. Next time, ask your wife before canceling. You might have had time to really talk about her day before you had to leave for your party but you should make it a priority to do so soon. Also its great that you can manage the kids when you\u2019re having a bad day but that doesn\u2019t mean your wife has to do the same as you. This can be a learning for both of you on how to manage when one of you needs a mental day.", "I kind of understand her viewpoint but also I completely understand why you'd cancel.

Dealing with your kids is different than dealing with lots of people you don't know.", "also, it's... just a company holiday party. some people go, some people don't. weird to take them so seriously that someone changing plans not to go with their partner would make them an AH; people saying that are probably not the types i'd want to encounter at a party anyway, tbh.", "Like he used his own words when discussing the decision to cancel the bbs with her? Nope. Didn\u2019t think so\u2026.", "Agree, but still a better option than trying to wrangle three kids through dinner, hygiene, and bedtime, or going to a company holiday party with a bunch of strangers.", "Right? Or even for the people disputing this just get a blanket make a fort for the kids, set up snacks and toys, setup a tablet and say okay mommy needs me time you guys stay in here and play while I relax and yall will still be in the same room. Like it\u2019s not that hard for kids to understand space at these ages.", "Work is a little different because the children have been conditioned that dad in office = do not disturb. There\u2019s not a chance in hell my kid would leave me alone if a sitter was here and I tried to chill in my room. \n\nThat being said, I could see having a bad day and just wanting to decompress and mindlessly window shop at a mall or read at a cafe - things I never get to do as a mom - but I wouldn\u2019t expect my husband to keep the sitter for me to bail on my plans with him and do that.", "Same! I\u2019ve been in two book clubs and both met once a month. I have a few friends who do book clubs too and they\u2019ve all been once a month. Even if by biweekly he meant every other week, that is a lot\u2026", "Even with the sitter there, she's unlikely to get that if the kids know she's there.", "Relaxing bath, mom edition:\n\n\"MOOOOOOOM!!! Josh is taking the remote again!! TELL HIM TO STOP! \"\n\n\"Give it to me!\"\n\n\"NO!!\"\n\n*wrestling noices*\n*heavy body falls*\n\n\"OW DON'T HIT ME!!\"\n\n\"MOM! MOM!\"\n\nPlus points if she works in a nursery and have dealt with noice, screaming and fighting or fussy kids the whole week.", "No, you\u2019re correct. It\u2019s one thing to say, \u201cI had a bad day and I don\u2019t think I can mentally handle your work event. But Jenny/Bob/Susan B. Anthony invited me to see a comedy show instead. That would really help me relax. Is it ok with you if I cancel on our plans and do that instead?\u201d That might be disappointing but it would be fine.\n\nIf they canceled because they got an invite to do something more fun *without being honest about their intentions* then that\u2019s messed up.", "Oh, I see, I thought you didn't like the fact OP went without his wife, apologies for the miscommunication. \n\nNo I don't think it would be acceptable to lie about not going out, but why would you pay $200 for a babysitter if your partner decided to stay home? \n\nThis event had been planned 2 months ago. The wife decided she didn't want to go basically at the last minute, why should OP miss an event he had been looking forward to just because his wife decided she didn't want to go? \n\nThey need to work on their communication.", "It was probably later in the evening --- by the time the sitter made other plans they didn't want to then cancel.", "I guess, to each their own. I mean now that my kids are in their 20\u2019s I have the money that I could drop a couple hundred like that, but when they were at the age where they needed a babysitter, no way. I remember taking care of them when all I wanted to do was crawl into bed and die, but in my mind that\u2019s just what it is to be a parent.", "She didn\u2019t but she could have communicated that. When you know the finances and know this is a splurge, you don\u2019t assume the extra expense isn\u2019t going to be cancelled if no longer needed without communication. She clearly had plans or something but didn\u2019t communicate and is taking it out on him.", "Yeah but a non shady person would say that. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bad day. I am sorry, I just can\u2019t people. I really wanted to go and sit in the movie theater alone.\u201d", "I mean. Have the sitter come, have a bath, lay in bed with takeout and watch a movie, \u201cpretend I\u2019m not here\u201d \n\nSounds heavenly.", "Alright we need a fund going to get these guys a decent punching bag!", "A stress ball doesn\u2019t last an hour with us!", "Our union has our first contract negotiations starting next month - I feel like we might need to borrow this idea lol", "They were going to go out for a rare couples time alone afterwards. It wasn't just the company party she last minute canceled, but alone time with the NTA husband. Then she did her best to make sure he didn't enjoy the company party.", "As someone who plans office events, it\u2019s actually really stressful when people say they will show up and don\u2019t. Paying for x amount of people who decided last minute to not show up is taking money from other things we can do. I am constantly trying to make educated guesses about how many people will a) show up without having told me and b) won\u2019t show up when they said they would. It\u2019s never consistent and causes a lot of problems.", "It isn't as much that she changed her mind but that she ruined his time at his party with continuously texting him because she was pissed that he canceled the babysitter.  She wanted the babysitter to take care of their kids even though she was going to be home.", "I think agreeing to go somewhere with your partner then flaking kind of rude, but I feel that way about any activity. Some people have a harder time going to social events so having their partner come is a show of support. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, just that for some people, it\u2019s not \u201cjust a company holiday party\u201d. And in some cases not going isn\u2019t really an option. \n\nThe blowing date night afterwards off after is what pushes it over for me. Like, she could have skipped the party, had quite a bit of time to relax and get ready and still gone on the planned date after with her husband.", "That largely depends on the company/department, if its 100 people going, yeah no one will notice who is or isnt there. But if its 15 and all your coworkers know you planning on going and suddenly are a no show, it will be talked about at work.", "lol what? He was the one who did all the planning. Why on earth should he intuitively know that his wife wants him to spend a couple hundred bucks so she can \u201cdecompress\u201d? No one in their right mind would have assumed the babysitter was still on the table. It\u2019s bizarre she even expected it, especially since she didn\u2019t verbalize that expectation. \n\nMost people can only afford a babysitter for a special occasion. Using the babysitter fund so his wife can randomly chill is absurd.", "???  Who pays for a sitter when you have a bad day?  Hmmmmm\u2026..", "Why would you need to check to cancel the babysitter? It's the logical next step and she didn't say anything beforehand.", "Dealing with it all is even while sick is definitely what we do as parents.\nBut I\u2019m just looking at it from the perspective of the babysitter is already scheduled, you\u2019d have paid that amount anyway if you both went. \n\nJust let her rest.", "Kids rarely pretend mom isn't there, even with a sitter.", "Plus it seems like many ppl are missing OP's comments that his wife has 6 scheduled nights out every month, during which time he stays with the kids. If you are child free you might think \"so\"? But if a mother wrote that her hubby left her alone with the kids 6nights/mon for the gym and get togethers with common interest friends while she (working full time like him)  had zero nights out AND the last time he took her out was 3 months ago, (if that's an average it works out to 4nights per yr as opposed to 6/mon) everyone would be screaming for her to divorce him.", "Let's say she entitled to have the sitter there. The problem is she didn't say anything. The first logical step to learning she is staying home is to cancel the sitter.", "Or cancel and you can afford your pay a babysitter and go out another night. I mean he had been looking forward to that date night for two months, and I would hope she had been too.", "The kids would snuggle up in bed with you to watch the movie.", "And why would she need a babysitter for that?"]}
