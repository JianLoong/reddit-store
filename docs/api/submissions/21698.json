My Mom was diagnosed 7 years ago with BPD and schizophrenia \n     Thru all my teen years I dealt with her countless outburst child like fits smashing things and being a compulsive liar. I've always tried to be understanding and either ignore her or help her however I can. My dad always  worked out of town so it was mostly just me and my mom.\n      I took on most of the household responsibilities with our dogs and yard work as my mom would go into depressive states for days. The real frustration started with the bills randomly not being paid dispite her definitely having the money to pay them. From time it would be either the water getting turned off or our phone plan or insurance on our vehicles. Her truck was even reposed at one point. Me being naive at the time I never really was suspicious of this just frustrated.\n       Fast forward to me being 21 parents had gotten divorced mom was seeing someone new, one day I check the mail to see a cash offer on our that was going into foreclosure. I called my dad to confirm this was real (it was). Turns out for years she had a secret gambling addiction that caused all these problems. We had a family intervention and me and her figured out other living plans.\n       Fast forward to today for the past 6 months there has been many incidents in her mental state. She has gone totally down the rabbit hole of conservative conspiracy theories from one world order and mRNA vaccines changing our DNA. Another recent one she sent me Snapchat videos of her in a complete manic state around her current husband which I found very disturbing. I've tried to lay down boundaries saying I'm not qualified to help her out with her current mental state. She claims she is seeing a psychiatrist of whom when I look up his name on Google nothing comes up.\n       Today is what lead to me temporarily blocking her. This morning 5:45am she texted my grandmother saying she was on the way to my house about 3 hours away completely unplanned. Her plan was to come over and convince me all her \"research\" on conspiracy theories are things I need to take seriously because they are \"true\".\n     When my mom asked me for my address today this was the message I sent to her.\n\n \"at this moment I really need some space from you. I really feel like you're not doing your best to help your mental health and trying to do what's best for yourself I feel like our dozens of heart to hearts hasn't gained you any progress. I'm willing to jump right back into your circle once I believe you are doing regular therapy and Dr visits. I'm sorry\"\n\nThis was extremely difficult for me especially the feeling like I can't help her. I ultimately feel right on what I did because and the end of the day she has refused to help herself.

That text was a lot kinder than a restraining order, which might ultimately prove necessary. It sounds like she's really heading for  bad situation if that 5:45 text and spontaneous journey to lecture you on conspiracy theories is anything to go by.
