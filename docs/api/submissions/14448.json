I\u2019m happy to help.\u201d \n\nWhen I made this offer I was thinking along the lines of cooking some food or watching her kids or being a letter of reference for a second job or better paying job. \n\nShe recently approached me saying she would like to take me up on my offer. It turns out she isn\u2019t single \u2014 her boyfriend is in prison \u2014 and has come up for a parole hearing. \n\nShe is trying to garner as much social media attention and support as she can for him. She asked us to, among other things, share social media posts about this, attend a demonstration on the day of the hearing, and sign something in support of him. \n\nI looked into what he\u2019s in prison for and it isn\u2019t even worth sharing specifics, the result was I have no interest in being involved with this. \n\nMy other coworkers feel similarly but also made blanket \u201c*Anything* I can do to help,\u201d offers so now feel obligated and are going ahead. I\u2019ve expressed I don\u2019t feel comfortable and my coworker is accusing me of making an empty gesture and attempting to use her to virtue signal, as well as just being a jerk in general. \n\nMy having a noticeable conflict with this person has made work really tense, for me and everyone else, so I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole for renegging on my original offer. It was clearly my mistake to make such a broad offer in the first place, but once I did, was it too late to pull back without being an asshole? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t feel right participating in her boyfriend\u2019s parole initiative but I feel like an asshole for both breaking a promise and making work tense for everyone.
