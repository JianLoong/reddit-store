Not impossible, but hey, this person is in crisis and our goal is to decrease their load, right?\n\nEven if I did end up needing help with something no one offered to do, it was easier to ask the concrete-offer people because I knew their offer wasn't BS, and because we are already talking in terms of concrete actions. \"Oh, I don't need a ride from the airport, but if you could give me a ride to the hospital the next day that'd be great\" is just easier.

You have to do what's right for you. If she were selling illegal substances, and she needed help with *that*, would that fall under the blanket \"anything\"? There are limits to *everything*. I suspect that the next time you make an offer like that, you'll put some qualifications on it...", "NTA. You envisioned something related to being a struggling single mother, not trying to get a criminal out of jail. This is significantly different and because she hadn't shared anything before she knows you had no idea.", "Next time, \"let me know what I can do to help\"", "i tell my siblings all the time to let me know if they need anything. often they don't and when they do they still understand that i can't always fulfill it...\n\nNTA", "Nta.", "NTA. You clearly offered to help her with single mom stuff, not dad in prison PR. My brain wants to use the word trashy but I don\u2019t want to be a jerk.", "No. But it teaches you to be specific when offering anything. Mind your own business!!", "Nta. Her request is not reasonable.", "NTA. You offered to help her and her kids. Not a felon you\u2019ve never met.", "NTA Anything I can do to help usually means within reason & for the person I make the offer to. I can't help with this because it goes against my principals & it is not for you!", "NTA. Offering to help does not in any way mean to help someone in prison. Absolutely not! This person is trying to manipulate you into helping them. To me this would be crossing boundaries. You also have every right to rescind any offer at anytime.", "NTA\n\nNone of what she is suggesting will do anything about his parole hearing.  I mean if he was a solid citizen in jail, that helps.  If an individual or individuals that he affected with his crime, speak on his behalf that could.  Honestly what you are suggesting will have no bearing on his parole hearing.  If anything protesting at his parole hearing might actually be detrimental.", "NTA. \n\nThis favor was not within the realm of what you reasonably could expect to be asked to do. Offering assistance to single mother as such is quite different than advocating on behalf of a criminal. It's a radical bait and switch, and if she is making your life uncomfortable because of your refusal I would strongly urge taking the conflict to your boss/HR.", "NTA had something similar happen and when I saw the charges I said I hope he was put down like a rabid dog but if she needed groceries or diapers let me know and I'd have it delivered. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, and it makes total sense she's mad at you, if she recognised that you were reasonable for not wanting to support her bf in prison, she would have to acknowledge that her bf is in prison for a good reason. It's misplaced anger, you've just become the target of her anger at her bf's circumstance. You will probably have to get hr involved, as you are unlikely to be able to talk her down, for the above reasons.", "NTA. Not reasonable to ask for getting publicly involved in a court case that you don't actually support. \n\nGoing forward I'm happy to help with anything in regards to XX. Be specific about these things otherwise people make outrageous requests.", "NTA.\n\nPeople say \u201canything\u201d when that is obviously not the case. If she had asked you for an organ donation, would people be mad at you for saying no?\u201d There are limitations to what is reasonable to expect from others.\n\nYou have a boundary, and that is ok.", "NTAH.   You were being a decent person making the gesture. It ends there.", "NTA, that your definition of support differs from her's\\their's sounds like the problem. That's still not breaking a promise. You promised support, buying a drunk a drink is not support. Follow your conscience.", "You promised to help her with something she needs. Not help her boyfriend with something he needs. Watch her kids while she goes to demonstration, sure. Be at demonstration, pass. That's the difference. You may want to clarify that for her that you didn't mean help her help others.\n\nNTA", "NTA and note to myself, next time I say \"I'll do anything, just ask\", I'll add in, \"except get involved in parole hearings.\"", "I say NTA, however I desperately want to know what the boyfriend is in prison for. No matter what it is, sharing social media posts is not real help in any sense of the word. \n\nBut I am fucking DYING to know what he's in for. \n\nplease, OP. you can dm me if you want, I won't tell anyone else.", "NTA\n\nI have been open to pretty broad interpretations of \"anything\" when friends have asked for help.  I have scrubbed toilets, gone catching bugs (pet store had a shortage of feeder crickets), loaned out furniture, loaned out my knee scooter, cooked meals, and watched children.\n\nI do not and will not testify as a false character witness.  You don't know her partner, don't know if he's reformed in any way, don't know if he's safe to be released, and can't honestly say that him getting out early would be in the best interests of their kids or anyone else.\n\nI've known too many abused spouses to blindly believe that someone is alright just because they're loved.", "NTA. Anything to help means actual support in the day to day. By her standards she thinks she can ask you to commit a crime and you would have to. There is a limit and she passed it for you.", "lol an offer to do \"anything\" is only ever interpreted as an offer to do truly \"anything\" if you've made the offer to a Faustian demon.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Tell her no or ignore her", "\u201cHappy to do anything to help\u201d \u201cHey, could you come protest for this issue you\u2019re directly in opposition to?  \u201cYou horrible, virtue-signaling person, you used me!\u201d", "Is there anything I can do for YOU, is different than is there anything I can do for your criminal(?) BOYFRIEND! \n\nNTA", "Especially when the offer was made prior to any knowledge of the court case. NTA", "No way I'm going to court or even submitting a letter in evidence supporting a person I don't know and haven't done any research deep dive on.

Coworkers flawed logic really shows why she is vouching for a convict in the first place.", "I think it's NAH until the coworker was badgering and creating an uncomfortable work environment. OP made a set of assumptions: single mom must have xyz issue. Coworker made a set of assumptions: OP said they'd help and this is what I need most of all. All this tall about \"social norms of support\" just goes to show how cast aside incarcerated people and their families are. I think unless you've had an incarcerated family member you can't know the toll that it takes, and we need to trust this woman that she knows what she needs. Having an incarcerated family member is traumatic and EXPENSIVE and does leave her parenting on her own. We don't know the charges or what OPs moral objection to it is, so I feel it's hard to judge that aspect-- some people are in jail for marijuana longer than for physical violence for example. OP made an offer, coworker asked for what SHE believes is most impactful in HER life. She is not the AH for asking, OP is not the AH for declining. The only AH behavior is the badgering from coworker.", "If you knew she was doing this for her boyfriend and offered to help with \"anything she needs,\" that would be different.", "This is an interesting take on this phrase. I can actually apply this to more than one situation I have going on. Thanks.", "I didn\u2019t look at whatever she wanted me to sign or ask any follow up questions but from what I picked up in context it was just a freeform petition or letter they were trying to fill with as many signatures as possible, not a legal document. \n\nI completely agree with you though and your image of me outside the courthouse has me chuckling.", "I did tell her a version of this. Unfortunately it landed me here. \n\nI agree with you in a perfect world it would\u2019ve ended there, though.", "I think this is a valid concern actually. \n\nI don\u2019t know one way or the other. I have no way of finding out. It\u2019s a big reason I don\u2019t feel comfortable participating whatsoever.", "And the thing is, based on what I read about why he is in prison, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily have a huge positive effect on her for him to be back in her life. \n\nObviously I know nothing about the situation and not at all enough to make a judgment call. \n\nBut I saw enough to know I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable influencing the situation in any direction (good or bad) because it is so out of my depth.", "As I understand it, to show whoever is making the decision about his parole (I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a judge or a jury or a panel of some kind) that a large group of people are upset about his incarceration, believe in his character, and are bringing attention to his case. \n\nIn short, to show the man support, and to exert pressure on the decision makers. \n\nShe does not deny he did what he did but does not believe he should be in prison for it, or at the very least, that he should have been released by now.", "It\u2019s because there is an implicit tag of \u201cwith regards to this issue\u201d (the struggle of being a single mom).", "Yeah but there\u2019s no way OP could have known the coworker\u2019s boyfriend is in prison and that coworker was going to ask her to help publicize the boyfriend\u2019s upcoming parole hearing. She didn\u2019t know enough to be able to say \u201cplease let me know if there\u2019s anything I can do to help you out, anything at all, except I cannot get involved with anything that has to do with someone in prison, for example I cannot publicize someone\u2019s upcoming parole hearing.\u201d  I mean come on. \n\nSocial norms and behaviors exist for a reason. The world cannot possibly communicate every single thing in a way that someone with autism clearly understands exactly what is being said.", "Jumping on this comment to say, \u201cif there is any way I can help, let me know\u201d does not translate to \u201cI will do anything you ask for in the way of help.\u201d", "I'm always down for a casserole", "I didn\u2019t consider this and it does encourage me to give them a bit of more benefit of the doubt here. Thank you for this perspective.", "Why didn't you look at it? Maybe he was falsely charged, there was a miscarriage of justice, civil rights violation, etc. Petitions often give reasons that would at least let you know why your coworker asked for this, even if you ultimately decided not to get involved", "Thank you for putting this abstract concept into words.\n\nI\u2019m glad to get third party confirmation it\u2019s applicable to this interaction as well, since she kind of made the argument it was within that scope.", "Or the also implicit tag of within reason so like asking for money or food may be within reason but asking to move in may not be", "(I'll put it at the top for you, I never said she was in the right or he was wrong. I included my vote in my first comment for a reason)\n\nDude crazy idea:\n\nSaying \"I can help you take care of your kids\" rather than just the blanket statement \"I'll help with anything\" is actually really easy. Refusing to communicate your feelings about a situation in words, doesn't make you superior.\n\nAlso you could apply your logic in reverse, there's no way she could of known he didn't mean *anything*.", "Ooh, I\u2019d never heard of this until your comment. Do you have a favorite version?\n\nPersonally I like this [broccoli chicken cheese](https://thecozycook.com/broccoli-cheddar-chicken-and-rice-casserole/) casserole because it\u2019s family friendly, comes together quickly, and freezes well in individual portions. \n\nYou can also replace the broccoli with any number of other vegetables if someone isn\u2019t a fan.", "I say the coworker is being unreasonable and if she's making you uncomfortable in the workplace, go to HR and explain the situation as you have here.\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s not though. You asked if there was something you could do to help her with her own parenting of her kids. Clothes, food, money, babysitting, etc. that\u2019s the scope. \n\nShe cannot use your goodwill towards something you didn\u2019t agree to. \n\nTell her the offer for help with her kids is still there but you are not offering to help with her partner\u2019s legal battles. \n\nIf she pushes then rescind the offer. I know it\u2019s harsh but your boundaries matter and you can\u2019t have someone taking a mile from an inch.", "I kind of agree with both you and the commenter above. Specifically I agree with you about social platitudes not always being understood and the reason for that being fair. Frankly I think often social platitudes aren\u2019t always specific enough. But this coworker hadn\u2019t shared that part of the puzzle either. \n\nIsn\u2019t it logical to assume that by not discussing that she isn\u2019t single but actually with someone in prison and is trying to get them out (especially since it sounds a bit more serious then petty crime) that her coworkers where being taken advantage of. If they had known would they have made the offer? \n\nI think if you are going to make this argument the opposite can also apply. These coworkers offered something nice with the understanding that this woman was on her own and could have needed help. But the truth was there was information missing. \n\nThis is why there\u2019s discrepancies with blanket statements. The stipulation is that it\u2019s something within reason, this request is outside of those bounds. It sucks but sometimes circumstances change or things adjust. Like if I offer to help with anything a friend needs, and I lose my job a few months later then if my friend asks for a loan it\u2019s now unreasonable and circumstances have changed.", "Try it with asparagus,you won\u2019t regret it.", "If this is out of your comfort zone, you're not obliged ethically or morally to do anything.", "I don\u2019t think this is an HR issue unless this woman begins to harass her coworkers over it."]}
