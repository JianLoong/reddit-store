Not impossible, but hey, this person is in crisis and our goal is to decrease their load, right?\n\nEven if I did end up needing help with something no one offered to do, it was easier to ask the concrete-offer people because I knew their offer wasn't BS, and because we are already talking in terms of concrete actions. \"Oh, I don't need a ride from the airport, but if you could give me a ride to the hospital the next day that'd be great\" is just easier.

They were not well of by any means and this kid spent a lot of time at our home. He was always included in every holiday and we always got him a little something knowing he wouldn\u2019t have it otherwise. One year before Xmas his mom told me that the dad had to leave to go to another state to find a job and that they were really struggling without him home, as well as no money. Every year my family picks a family that either we know or that someone brings to my attention, to really bless for the holidays. That year a bunch of my friends went it with us and we got the mom and both kids almost $1000 in visa gift cards, the kids each got their own and the mom as well. Turns out, the mom took both kids cards from them as soon as we gave them to them and used them to pay for a storage unit. Now I\u2019m not gonna say what you can do with something after I give it, but that money was for those kids to be able to have a nice Xmas and get some clothes and other things they desperately needed. About two weeks later my other neighbor told me that they\u2019d seen on the news that the dad was not in fact out of town working, he was in jail because while working for this large hotel here in town as a maintenance man, he had been going in and stealing thousands of dollars in valuables from hotel guests. Not only did I feel betrayed, but I had believed her and also had my friends participate in the gift giving. She lied to the one person who would have gone and done anything for them. I don\u2019t think the kids knew the truth about the dad being locked up, so I let it be, because it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to them to bring the truth to them. But I never gave her another dime or support. It\u2019s one thing to be needy and ask for help, but when you\u2019re doing it under false pretenses, I\u2019m just not down with that.

You should not be pressured into this.", "Nta. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable then don\u2019t do it. If they think you\u2019re a jerk then let them think that.

Great friend but not up my alley, I can\u2019t stand by something and look dumb too. I\u2019ll supper u from afar tho, just say it\u2019s against your religious beliefs lol", "NTA. most would agree your offer does not encompass participation in activities that conflict with your moral judgment.

Don't know, don't care how reliable your narrative is, because in the end it doesn't matter--your situation is not everyone else's.\n\nYou are telling me that I don't get to reach my own conclusions as to the likelihood of MY actions/money/support being helpful and/or being consistent with MY values.   That's not how it works.   If an acquaintance wants me to help spring her abusive ex who assaulted her or abused her kids?   Not helping her, no matter how much she thinks she wants it, because I know that enabling the abusive guy would not help, she just doesn't understand that yet.    A known addict wants a bunch of money?   Not giving it to them.   I might bring them groceries or pay some of the rent directly to the landlord, or do something for the kids, but I'm not giving them enough cash to buy drugs.  So yeah, I AM making judgements as to what will help, as is my right.\n\nTry just telling acquaintances that you need $1000 to save your life without further explanation, just insist that it you need it,  and see how quickly they write that check.

If you need any of those things, feel free to ask.", "NTA. \n\nShe isn't a single parent because her spouse passed on or is very ill, etc \n\nShe is a single parent because of a choice her spouse made knowing the consequence were she'd be alone. \n\nI'd see her still asking for baby sitting or any of the things that OP offered ... but to get involved in a criminal case and to defend a criminal She doesn't even know?\n\nTo much.", "NTA. You made an offer of general assistance, not specific assistance. You still have to live with yourself. So no, you are not obligated to buy her a house, give her your kidney, or sign a letter on behalf of her (pederast?) boyfriend.

I refuse to post on social media and go to a demonstration I don't believe in regardless of the relationship.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA. Her request is freaking unfathomable haha. It\u2019s like telling you pigs can fly. People have to believe in a cause to support. Your co-workers are enablers if they\u2019re co-signing even though they don\u2019t agree. And trust me, THIS WILL GET WORSE lol", "NTA and this is come from a convicted felon.", "Technically you said she was free to *ask* if there was anything you could do, not free to *demand*.\n\nSo she asked, as she was free to do.\n\nI know this isn't going along with the intention of what you meant, but she overstepped those bounds first by putting you in this situation and took it well beyond your original offer which from context was just about helping with the kids or some domestic tasks.\n\nNTA.", "Maybe offer to buy a case of water bottles and make some bagged lunches for the people who are willing to go?

I also can\u2019t imagine what posting on social media is going to do. Most people are going to have your reaction because trying to get a fireb*mber out of jail is generally not something most people are going to be supportive of. \n\nPlus why would she want to have someone with that record against them around her children? That doesn\u2019t seem like a safe person for them to grow up with. \n\nI don\u2019t blaming you for noping the fuck out of there.

BOMBED. and then assaulted someone who thought he was injured not realizing he\u2019s the one who caused the problem. she absolutely SHOULD NOT be judged for questioning endorsing him. you can be rehabilitated in jail, sure. but what\u2019s stopping him from firebombing HER office if he and the coworker break up", "You don\u2019t just oops a firebombing like you can oops a manslaughter or oops a possesion charge, that takes planning and shit.", "I think I misrepresented what I was trying to say. I fully agree that op shouldn't do what was asked. And is nta for refusing the request.\n\nBut their judgment of this woman's situation feels iffy to me. If it's a violent crime, then yeah, judge away. If it's something like drug possession... Well, it's pretty well known how the justice system imprisons men for an outrageous amount of time for having a couple ounces of weed in their pocket. \n\nThe way op has agreed with other commenters about this man probably being dangerous to the child, and the general sense of judgment doesn't sit right with me. So the context matters in my opinion.", "Yep. And probably some kind of manifesto or belief system that advocates fire bombing.", "she did say what he did though, albeit her comment was posted after yours. his firebombing an office park is a violent crime, actually it\u2019s terrorism. he\u2019s a domestic terrorist. and i do agree the justice system is flawed deeply, but in this case i don\u2019t think it was and he could actually be a danger to OP in the long run if he and coworker don\u2019t pan out", "Oof, and if the reasons happened to be racist, if anything prison would radicalize the dude, not reform him. I certainly wouldn\u2019t campaign for the mans release just because his baby momma asked without knowing a lot more than OP already does.", "Ah! I didn't see that.

This is asking a lot.", "NTA, but if ya wanna be non-confrontational about it, could share it and make it that it is only viewable by her in privacy settings, that's saved my ass a few times.", "On top of this, you can also just clarify. Just because she interpreted your offer on a way doesn't make it true. After making the offer you can clarify it. \n\n\"let me clarify. When I made this offer I meant to help you with things like the occasional babysitting or help with making food. I am sorry you interpreted this differently, but I hope we are on the same page on expectations now, as I am not comfortable with helping in regards to your husband. I am hoping we can still work professionally at work.\"\n\nThis way, you set clear expectations and boundaries in a professional way. And if HR will ever be involved, it will be clear you aren't making  this a hostile situation over something that doesn't even involve work. I recommend at least sending this to her through email. You can also first tell her this in person of you prefer it that way and then also send it through email and preface it \"as we just discussed in person...\" Then you also have proof for HR of that is ever needed.\n\nAlso, any normal person would understand you reneging that offer. Even if you actually made that offer, circumstances can change as you get more information or things happen in your life. Everybody taking that statement as \"you have to help me by saying that one sentence no matter what I ask because you used the word anything\" is entitled and stupid. Don't let her get in your head.", "I saw somewhere that they aren't denying his guilt, but they are trying to make the case that he is safe to re-enter society. Which is just stupid to ask. Because OP doesn't know the man. I have no experience with the courts and early release, but I assume they will actually want to speak to people endorsing him and will ask if people know him and if they endorse him on good grounds (or at least ask for a statement from people). And saying \"his wife trusted him so I signed and endorsed him\" I really hope won't cut it. They won't just trust some random people signing a petition and release him I may hope lol."]}
