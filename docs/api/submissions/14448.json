There are very few people out there who can make it through something tough and not be a jerk at some point.\n\nFood for future thought: when I've gone through hard times previously, the people who came up with concrete things they could do and offered those were so, so much more helpful than the blanket \"anything you need\" people. Don't get me wrong; both are appreciated, but the friend who said \"hey you don't need to uber home from the airport after the funeral; I'll pick you up and we'll grab your favorite pizza on the way\" took a weight of my shoulders without my even having to muster up the mental energy to ask. For the anything-you-need people that puts the burden on the person in crisis a) come up with tasks b) assess who would be capable of doing said tasks (including trying to assess if the \"anything you need\" offer was real or just politeness, and what that person's \"anything\" limits may be)  and c) manage task assignment.  Not impossible, but hey, this person is in crisis and our goal is to decrease their load, right?\n\nEven if I did end up needing help with something no one offered to do, it was easier to ask the concrete-offer people because I knew their offer wasn't BS, and because we are already talking in terms of concrete actions. \"Oh, I don't need a ride from the airport, but if you could give me a ride to the hospital the next day that'd be great\" is just easier.
