My son has been married for two years at this point. We get along as well as water and oil. I just keep my distance because I don\u2019t like dealing with her. \n\nShe is a horrible picky eater, I don\u2019t know why but truly I don\u2019t care because she is a pain at restaurants. We try to go anywhere and we have to change places multiple times so she can have something to eat. She makes the waiters go through hoops so she will have something she likes and if anything is wrong she will bitch about it or pout in the corner.\n\nExample: She got a quesadilla, removed everything on it, and when it came out she sent it back because there was sour cream on the side, it wasn\u2019t touching anything and she mad a huge deal about her food being wrong. She doesn\u2019t have allergies either.\n\nWhat really made me dislike her is that she complained about the food at a funeral, they had a sandwich spread but went on about it\u2019s gross multiple times.\n\nSo I had a dinner  yesterday and I invited everyone but my sons wife ( son wasn\u2019t invited either but he was on a business trip). My other DIL posted it online and I got a call from DIL. She was pissed I didn\u2019t invite her and asked why, I told her it\u2019s due to her being an embarrassment at dinners and I won\u2019t be inviting her to dinners. She called me a jerk and hung up.\n\nNow my son is on my ass and I am wondering if I should apologize or not.\n\n\nEdit: I\u2019m going to say it, it doesn\u2019t matter if she has an eating disorder or is on the spectrum. Both those group know how to act  at a funeral or restaurant. It may be harder but they can. \n\nEdit2. So to make it clearer, I have three DIL and one SIL, we all have a good relationship besides this one DIL (3/4) it\u2019s not me that\u2019s the issue here.   They don\u2019t like her either\n\nAlso I find the threat of I better bend down to her or I won\u2019t see her kids such a stupid threat. I\u2019m already a grandma and if she withholds her kids then that\u2019s on them and would be depriving the kids of grandparents on my sons side.\n", "created_utc": 1699449798, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17qljsa/aita_for_telling_my_dil_she_wasnt_invited_since/", "score": 10478, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn't about her being picky. This is about her behavior - she is disrespectful, childish, impossible to please, and makes everyone else suffer because of it. I've met elementary school kids with better manners.", "NTA She is not just being picky; she could be being discreet and considerate about it, and setting limits for herself, but she's not. She's acting like a spoiled child pouting, whining, and having no consideration for how her behavior affects fellow diners and restaurant staff.\n\nSaid simply: Picky may possibly be accommodated for (even if it's a pain), but rude and inconsiderate shouldn't be accommodated, especially when it's utterly predictable. You should make this distinction clear to anyone coming to you supporting her.\n\nWhen you know that she is going to make the experience miserable for everyone in a completely needless way through selfish behavior, why should she be invited?\n\nEven accommodating polite pickiness should have its limits. You don't waste everyone's time endlessly and ruin the flow of the night because you can't get exactly what you want.\n\n\\*Typo fix", "NTA. She OPENLY complained about the sandwich spread at a funeral? That's all you have to point out to her, and to your son, and to anyone else who challenges you on this. She either behaves at mealtime like a decent human being or you, for one, will not be inviting her to dinner.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having food issues. But if you abuse waitstaff and make a scene at restaurants, you\u2019re not invited.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about inclusion, it\u2019s about enabling her abusive and antisocial behavior", "NTA,  as someone who is also a picky eater there is no reason for acting that way. I go out of my way to look at menus before going anywhere. I find something I can eat and know how it will need to be modified before ordering. I try to be as clear as possible when asking for modifications and if somehow it's messed up I'm apologetic with staff when asking for it to be fixed. I understand I'm the difficult one in the situation and try to minimize the trouble to staff that my texture and food aversions can cause. \n\nIn the Spring I visited the DC area and while there arranged to meet a cousin for dinner. When they asked where I might like to go I let them know I had texture and food aversions and absolutely will not eat seafood. That I generally have no problem ordering something I like at Italian, or Chinese restaurants. Or American fair or steakhouses. She sent me the link to a menu for one of their favorite places and asked if this place looked okay. I saw a few things on the menu that looked good and would require no, or only a minor modification so they made a reservation. We had a wonderful dinner and my pickiness did not affect dinner in any way. It's totally possible to be a picky eater without acting like an asshole about it .", "NTA. I hate eating out with people who are super picky and make scenes. Going out becomes unenjoyable for everyone. I'd simply tell her that she clearly doesn't actually enjoy eating out, so you are saving her from the hassle.", "Geez, I'm a pick eater...\n\nBut if a restaurant or event doesn't have a single entree/salad/dish/desert I like, then keep my mouth shut, have a soda/drink, and eat at home.\n\nThe problem isn't the food.

Maybe she will learn to stop complaining about everything if she\u2019s not invited when your son isn\u2019t also coming.  Stop catering to her by switching restaurants, etc.  Let her pout like a child.  Let it be your son\u2019s problem to deal with.  She can learn to behave or not come.", "She is controlling the whole thing and she knows it. Making you switch places to eat, running the servers ragged. She has to be the center of attention and I would not tolerate her shenanigans. Leave her out of more things and I bet she cools her jets.

I'm a picky eater and you'll never hear me moaning out loud about my food being gross or too nasty for me to eat in a public place.

Are you respectful with wait staff and fellow diners or do you act like the worst toddler throwing a tantrum?\n\nShe\u2019s the latter, NTA.", "NTA\n\nComplaining about the food at funeral is so disgusting. I would never speak to someone who behaved that despicably again. I used to be a very picky eater, but in public, I just got on with it. I never whined or complained, I just sometimes had to feed myself privately afterwards. It's very easy to be polite.", "NTA I\u2019m on the spectrum and a vegan but I don\u2019t make a fuss and tend to eat before I go out so I don\u2019t cause a problem for others - even if I don\u2019t  eat prior there is always something I can eat on the menu, this girl needs to realise the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her and her foibles and if your son is backing her up then don\u2019t invite either of them until she learns how to behave in public", "NTA Franky speaking i would do the same. I have several food related allergies and Intoleranzes but i wouldn't even Dream about talking to a Server.

I\u2019m a picky eater but not by choice. I have the unfortunate combo of ADHD and being a super taster. I\u2019ve been in plenty of situations as an adult where I can\u2019t eat anything that is offered. I keep my mouth shut and don\u2019t draw attention to myself.", "Nta- i was sure by the title but nope.\nHere's the thing :\nYOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO INVITE ANYONE to dinner or elsewhere.\nThis wasn't an open invitation.  You didn't invite your don either (reasons don't matter). Your DIL went out of her way to confront you. She was looking for a fight. \nIn the future maybe keep your real reasons to yourself as neither your DIL or son is capable of handling them.  Polite platitudes are my friend", "NTA\n\nI myself am a rather picky eater. That doesn't mean I demand the family change restaurants when going out to eat or complain about the free meal I get at a family event. The problem sounds like it is less about her being picky and more about her being rude about it.", "NTA.  Complaining about the food at a funeral??????

How obnoxious can she be?", "I gotta say, I have autism and extreme sensory issues when it comes to food, and I can find something to eat at any restaurant I go to, even if it\u2019s an app or a side or off the kids menu. If I was at a funeral and there was nothing I could eat, I wouldn\u2019t eat. I\u2019ve brought my own dishes to peoples houses (after asking) to make sure I had food at a dinner party. Were you a little harsh, maybe. But you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA, she's clearly entitled and high-maintenance.

She's crossed that line. \n\nIf a food isn't touching yours; just don't fucking eat it. If you don't like the options at any event in which YOU didn't host, just don't fucking eat it.... how Incredibly rude of her. \n\nI would say to son....\"My meal choices will not be held hostage to her bad behavior. You're invited to go BUT we won't be changing restaurants and anytime she's out of line to a waiters/ waitress I'm not gonna bite my tongue anymore and I'll call her out on it; you can chose to attend or not\"", "People like this are attention seekers. Making wait staff jump through hoops for no reason just so they can feel special. Don\u2019t continue to dine out with this person. She will get your food spit in regularly with this behavior.", "NTA. My mother in law is the exact same way. She will call a waiter over, take 15 minutes to explain how she wants her food cooked, and then complain that it's not right. Example: we went to a pizza place that is well known for its pizza and the way it's cooked. It's a really deep dish pizza, about 3.5\" thick. From the bottom, it's crust, then all the toppings, including cheese, then sauce on top. This is how the pizza is advertised. It's what they are known for. My mother in law got into a 20 min argument over this. She wanted a thin crust, then sauce, then cheese, then toppings. Like you can get at any old take out pizza joint. After 20 min, they still said no. They did compromise and make the pizza (still thick) with crust, cheese, and then the sauce and toppings on the side. It was so embarrassing. \n\nEven if she picks a restaurant, she goes thru the same ordeal every time. After all the fuss, she will then take a minimum of 2 hours to eat 10 bites of food and end up taking it all home. She will hold up a server's table for hours. 9 times out of 10, the manager will give her free dessert to go if she leaves due to her holding up a table for hours. It's embarrassing. I dread going places with her. I have 6 kids, and they have made fun of her antics (in front of her) since they were about 7 years old. At least since the pandemic, she has become a hermit and won't leave the house, so we no longer have to deal with this stupid behavior. However, she still torments the restaurants and delivery app drivers on a daily basis (the woman can't boil water, she orders out EVERY single meal).", "NTA\nThis is controlling and attention seeking behavior.

Certified picky eater here (I'm on the spectrum so it's the whole taste, texture, etc.). I have never sent my food back, and I can always find something at any restaurant. They will have SOMETHING. \n\nI'm also a server. Sending your food back multiple times and making me jump through hoops without any actual allergies just pisses me off. PICK IT OFF at that point or don't order it in the first place. Most restaurants tell you exactly what's in it on the menu, and they'll also get you a sample if you want to try anything. \n\nI wouldn't invite her either. If you can't handle your own picky eating, you should stay eating at home.", "I\u2019m a horribly picky eater (I wish I wasn\u2019t) and I would never complain about the food anywhere it\u2019s so rude.

She loudly states that making a sandwich shouldn't take that long, especially when they are fixing a mistake.  She again complains to the waiter about the new sandwich; something about it not being toasted, but decides to eat it anyway because everybody else was almost done.
