There\u2019s nowhere local to park, apart from one car park round the back, which is strictly residents only. Each person has to pay for their space which is then allocated with a number matching their flat. There are signs clearly stating this, but it is never checked or enforced. Besides this though, the nearest parking is a good walk away down some dodgy side roads.\n\nNow this happened last Wednesday, when i got home from work and there was a car i had never seen before parked in my space. i didn\u2019t think anything of it as maybe a neighbour had visitors who parked there without realising or something like that. It was a little bit frustrating, but no big deal. i wrote on a small piece of paper \u201cplease do not park here, i pay for this space and am heavily pregnant\u201d and stuck it under the cars wiper. i parked my car down the side streets, and by the time i walked to my apartment, i was tired and my back was starting to ache from all of the stairs too.\n\nAnyway, Thursday when I got home from work, there wasn\u2019t anybody there, so i assumed i was right, a neighbour had guests and it was a one off that someone parked there. Or maybe they read my note and parked elsewhere. However Friday, i got home from work again and there was the exact same car as 2 days ago in my space. I was especially tired this day and just not feeling it, so i walked up to the car and let down the front 2 tires. This time, i didn\u2019t leave a note.\n\nLater that evening, i heard someone talking and went so i could hear the conversation better. It was a man speaking to someone saying that he was stuck as he had 2 flat tires and was unable to move his car. He seemed angry about it, so i didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nSaturday morning, his car was still there, but it was gone later that evening. I told my husband about it, and he said i am a massive asshole and even though i pay for the space, i shouldn\u2019t mess with someone else\u2019s car, i should have left another note instead.\n\nI don\u2019t think i was being unreasonable though, so AITA?\n\nedit: im from the uk and we can\u2019t call tow trucks here.", "created_utc": 1696256828, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xy36r/aita_for_letting_down_a_cars_tires_for_parking_in/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The person who repeatedly parked in your space is definitely an AH, that goes without question. As far as letting air out of the tires - well, it's not really damaging anything (it's not good for the tire sidewalls, but it's not going to destroy them), but it is counterproductive as far as getting them to move. If it's an option to get them towed, that would solve both problems.", "NTA, I love petty and swift retribution.", "NTA. Screw them. They were warned and disregarded it. You have no obligation to be extra nice and warn them a second time. If more people faced immediate, tangible consequences like this for their bad behavior, the world would be a better place.

He used it once and you were nice enough not to have it towed.  I get it, mistakes happen, give people a chance. But the second time...

Kidding.....NTA OP.", "Call a tow truck next time", "ESH!! Sorry but there was a better way of dealing with this like calling a tow truck. You basically damaged another persons vehicle out of spite. He sucks too for continuing to park in your spot. Next time think with your head and not your emotions. Being heavily pregnant and walking a lot sucks - I know, I worked jobs where I was on my feet for both of mine, but it doesn't give you an excuse to damage another persons property.", "NTA Have it towed.", "Esh\n\nCall a tow truck. That would get the car out of your space, and teach them a lesson about parking in the space. And all of that is *legal*... which is the important part. \n\nWhat you did is illegal, regardless of if it's your space or not. Depending on how you flattened the tires also changes how illegal (mischief or straight out vandalism with damaging property). To add on to all that, by flattening the tires you guarantee the car will actually be there *longer*.\n\nNext time, use common sense.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYour option was to have the car towed, which you could have done even on the first offense if you wanted to come in hard about it. You don't get to semi-vandalize the vehicle.\n\nUnless you mean you \"slashed\" his tires, letting the air all the way out of a car tire to the point that it's flat takes a bit of effort.  it's not as simple as taking the plug out of a pool float and whoosh it all rushes out. \n\nYou're heavily pregnant but still took the time and effort to remove the valve cap, then find something to press into the valve to release the air, and stood there doing that for the whole time it took to flatten the tire? That's not just petty, that's silly.", "ESH - Whilst yes, they are inconsiderate and should go by the rules that you politely informed them of, letting someone's tires down could not only be dangerous but could even be considered a crime.   \nWould I do the same? Probably.", "ESH.", "ESH - Him because he obviously knew that he wasn't supposed to park there by the 2nd time. And you because you messed with someone else's property, that honestly probably just prolonged him from getting out of your space. I would have went N  T A had you just called a tow truck on him the second time instead? I mean you are paying for that spot, so wouldn't you be able to call a tow truck to remove the car?", "ESH - he's an asshole for parking in your spot after being warned. You're an asshole for letting the air out of his tires. It doesn't seem to have been a particularly useful solution for you either. You should have just called to have his car towed.", "ESH- I mean he definitely sucks you left a note and explained to him not to park there. But there had to be something in between leaving a note and property damage that you could've done. There's not a parking or building manager you could complain to, or a way to find out whose car it is to complain in person?\n\nPlus if his car is disabled in your spot, you definitely can't park there.", "ESH - tow the car. You could be liable for damage if you bring the tires down to sit on the rims.", "I don't blame you for being mad, but that wasn't the best solution. 1, because flattening the tires forced him to stay there, which is the opposite of what you wanted. And 2, because thanks to the note you left last time, he can reasonably guess who did the vandalism and press charges. \n\nGetting him towed would have been the better solution, or asking your neighbors or husband to look out for people parking in your spot so that someone can confront them directly next time it happens. Still, hopefully this is resolved now, and good luck with the baby!", "Tow the car don't do something that could get you charged!", "ESH him obviously for parking in your spot the second time, but why would you let air out of tires? Doesn't that make it more difficult for you if the vehicle gets left longer because it can't move? If it happens again call a tow truck or the lot manager and have them call a tow truck.", "ESH report to the complex and have them call a tow service next time. Don't flatten his tires. I laughed out loud, but that's not a good way to handle things. You could be putting yourself and unborn baby in danger if the man gets too angry about it and finds out it was you.", "You're both the asshole. What they did sucks, but what you did is vandalism.", "YTA Call  tow truck if it happens again. Unless you want to get arrested for vandalism.", "YTA; don\u2019t mess with someone\u2019s car. Just call the city for a tow.", "Nah, but since you pay for that spot, couldn\u2019t you have them towed?", "Ummm...I think that's probably a misdemeanor crime, OP. You're tampering with someone's property. Yes, he shouldn't have parked in your space but that's when you call the company you're paying money to and demand that they do some sort of enforcement.\n\nI have to agree with your husband, YTA.", "YTA - this is what tow companies are for. You vandalized their car instead of using the proper channels.", "ESH, never resort to petty vandalism. Call a tow truck.", "You\u2019re lucky he didn\u2019t seem to have a dashcam", "ESH. He\u2019s an asshole for parking in your space, but it\u2019s not cool or legal to let air out of the tires. You went nuclear over a small inconvenience. Not cool.", "YTA - someone parking in your space doesn\u2019t mean you can commit criminal damage to their property.", "Yta", "YTA.  The proper way to deal with this is have the vehicle towed.", "You VANDALIZED his car.  Is he an asshole?  Yes, but you have no right to touch his vehicle.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
