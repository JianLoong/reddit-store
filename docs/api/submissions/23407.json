He was a big collector of old Petroleum items like globes, signs and gas pumps. I have 3 siblings and I was the only one that would travel around the United States with my dad when he went out to swap meets and people's house to buy and sell stuff. I really enjoyed traveling with him. \n\n14 years ago I joined the military, 13 years ago I got married. Since then, my parents and I have had a contentious relationship. Arguments and periods of not communicating with each other. It's tough for me to visit, because I'm a single income household and I support 3 other people on my pay.\n\nAfter my father died, I've tried to have a better relationship with my mom and invited her to visit and talk more. \n\nWhen my father died over a year ago. He did not leave a will. My mother got everything. I asked for a few things after his death. But none of the gas collectibles because they are rare and worth a good bit of money. I also did not want to seem greedy, She did tell me she was hanging onto everything for the forcible future. I told her, everything is yours. It is your decision to do what you want with everything. In my mind I wanted a few things and figured there would be a day that my mom would ask if I wanted anything.  \n\nI found out last week she was selling everything through an online auction. I called to talk to her about it. She eventually told me she asked the kids if they wanted anything. She didn't ask me. She then told me, because of our arguments since I've joined the military. That I didn't deserve anything. I did ask if I bought anything at auction, would she refund me. She didn't answer. The auction is over. I was able to get one thing. But nothing that I truly wanted. \n\nShe did say she still wants a relationship. I don't think she understands how hurt I am. I've tried to explain it.  I tell her you called your kids, but you didn't call me. Am i not your child? I loved my dad, even if i you think i don't deserve anything at least let me buy stuff before anyone else can. She just digs up the past 10 years.\n\n I talked to my siblings about it and they understand if I want to cease my relationship with my mother. I'm deployed to the middle east right now and I told them I was disappointed in them not informing me, my mom was selling everything. \n\nI don't know what to do. Should I keep bringing it up that it was unfair of her not to offer anything to me. Even tho everything is hers. I don't know what type of relationship we can have after this.\n\nEdit: my three siblings had about 30+ items to pick from. Only one person, picked one item. Because they weren't invested in the stuff. They also admitted to me they knew I'd be the only one interested in then", "created_utc": 1690628356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cpgsf/aita_in_response_to_my_fathers_inheritance/", "score": 210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were not looking for handout but for fight of first refusal (i.e. buy at market price before auction). That is something very reasonable and would not cost her a penny.  She is clearly does not see you as part of the family. I am not sure if \"keep bringing it up\" will change anything (she can not undo auction and I doubt she will understand at this stage). You need to make a decision what it means for the relationship on your side and act on it.  \n\nPS: You can contact the auction and see if they are willing to contact buyers anonymously for a few items dear to you and ask if they willing to sell items back to you. Not everyone is willing to do it but I have seen it done.", "Firstly , thank you for your service ! NTA , what she did was very spiteful. Those things were items that held memories tied to time spent with your dad , I don\u2019t think she understands that clearly and probably never will , but do you really want to have someone that vindictive in your life moving forward ?", "NTA. You have every right to feel wronged by how you were treated. I would personally limit contact after something like this. If my own family didn\u2019t treat me like family, I would want nothing to do with them.", "NTA. She will not apologize to you, nor is it ever worth it to ask for one.", "NTA - You\u2019re upset and mad because of what your mother did. She was very wrong and mean to leave you out of your father\u2019s inheritance, especially when you loved his collection with him.\n\n*  She had no right to use your old fights as a reason to keep you from something that was important to you. \n* She should have at least let you pick something or buy something before the auction.\n*  She is the one who is being selfish and nasty. \n\nYou can stop talking to her if she doesn\u2019t say sorry or care about your feelings. You\u2019re not in charge of her actions or her happiness.", "NTA, let her go & move on with your life", "NTA and go no contact. She clearly doesn't consider you one of her children. I am sorry that she is such a petty mother.", "NTA- It was a bit uncalled for to get upset with your siblings for your mother\u2019s actions, but your mother is the AH here overall. She hasn\u2019t apologized for keeping you from PURCHASING your father\u2019s belongings. The purchasing is even too much, but not even giving you that opportunity makes her ridiculous and vindictive.", "No judgment because we don't know enough background.\n\nYou're allowed to be upset and you can choose to stop having a relationship with your mother. But on the other hand, it was totally her right to sell any of her own possessions.\n\nI don't know why your relationship was already bad, but not including any of that makes me think you're either hiding your own mistakes or attitudes your parents had that you're ashamed to share. You're probably not going to get very useful advice without telling us the whole story.", "NTA. Time to move on.", "NAH.  You have every right to be disappointed in your mother's behaviors. However, as you said, it IS her stuff and she has every right to sell it. What's more, you made a lot of assumptions about what would (your mom asking you if you wanted stuff) and would not happen. Also, you failed to express your interest in those memorabilia when you could/should have;  as in \"mom, if you ever want to get rid of the old oil stuff, I'd be interested in buying it from you.\"\n\nThat in 13 years you and your parents did not heal that rift and that your mother holds onto things that you may have said quite long ago are not good. At this point you have a choice to make: let go of the relationship (and recognize that you will, in all likelihood, be disinherited) or work to heal it because you think that there's something worth holding onto (e.g., her grandchildren getting to know her). You cannot control your mother; but you can control your own actions.", "ESH. You guys need to learn how to communicate", "NAH Thank you for your service. Your mother may be the AH, but that is no surprise.  What is truly disappointing is the lack of respect from your siblings. You have chosen your path and hopefully you can continue your father's traditions at future swap meets. You may be a cycle breaker in this dysfunctional family dynamic. I understand how hard it must be to communicate your wants clearly while not appearing greedy.  You might teach this value to your own progeny! Take care.", "ESH. You literally told her to do what she wanted with those items. And then you just assumed she\u2019d offer them someday? If you wanted them so badly you should\u2019ve just asked her for them.\n\nShe sucks for what she did but why didn\u2019t you just be direct with her in the first place?", "YTA Her husband JUST DIED. She is DEVASTATED, and you want to argue over stuff. You have no idea the hell she is in. Your only question is what about me. YTA ALL DAY", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But you can change your expectations of her and maybe should look into therapy for dealing with that relationship.\n\nMy condolences on your losses. I wish you well.", "NTA. \u201cI called my kids\u201d. This right here is the only thing that matters. That is scorched earth and she deserves no further consideration from you.", "NTA and f\\*\\*k her what a terrible mother.  Delete that awful women from your life.", "I mean I suppose the context as to what exactly transpired between you and your father is relevant. \n\nINFO \n\nWhat occurred between you that resulted in estrangement to the point where your mom didn\u2019t want you to have these items?", "I understand being hurt that his siblings didn't reach out to him once the mom decided they could select belongings from their father's possessions. It would seem like a conversation would be warranted between the siblings in the event more than one person desired the same item to avoid conflict. It's sad to read that relationships in this family seem to be deteriorating even further after the father's death.", "I did say that, and they are/ were hers. She still contacted my siblings tho.", "Oh grow up", "He died in February of last year", "What transpired between you and your parents that she wouldn\u2019t even want you to have these items even if you purchased them?", "NTA. I simply do not understand these parents that do something like this, but then still want a relationship. Why would anyone do that? They already showed how they feel about you.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for your Service. I am also sorry that the woman who birthed you is so heartless and cruel. Please, for your own well being, cut ties. If she will treat you, her own child, so cruelly, I hate to imagine how she would treat your children. Best for you & your little Family to go NC. You are NTA. Be safe, blessing on you, your wife & kids.", "\\>They also admitted to me they knew I'd be the only one interested in then\n\nAnd they didn't think to ask if you wanted anything, so they could claim it and pass it on? This is what I came to ask, only to see right at the end that they had not chosen to act on it.\n\nYou are NTA in the slightest. The gall of the woman to say she still wants a relationship after telling you that you were entitled to nothing of your dead dad's beloved items...", "NTA. Your mom made the decision to exclude you when asking if her kids wanted anything, they didn't tell you. \n\nFocus in the family you created, those others don't care about you.", "Wow. I believe your mother has made the decision for you. If she doesn't consider you her child, yhen don't consider her your mom.  She was being petty and vindictive by not allowing you to choose things that had been your father's. I would match her energy.", "NTA.. your family is especially your mom is a massive AH.. she should not be surprised when you go NC. I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "I agree with your assessment: it was done out of spite. It may be hard, but for their own mental health, it would probably be better to go LC or NC. NTA", "INFO: So what caused the estrangement/arguments? Without that context I can't give a vote. Also it isn't clear that your father would even want you to have his precious items given that you were at odds for more than a decade.", "Your mother is -pretty nasty. She knew the significance to you and your father. She deliberately cut you out of any access to the \"treasure\" that you had a hand in gathering. And she expects you to shrug and hold her in the highest regard?\n\nNTA. No one would blame you for going NC. She deserves it. If she isn't expecting it, she's a fool. Chances are, though, that she will just complain to all that will listen without any ownership on her part in this.", "NTA. That relationship is already gone. She made it extremely clear she doesn't value you and doesn't seem to care about you at all. You're done.", "NTA please go no contact with your mother. Send her a message that you cannot forgive her toxic and hurtful behaviors. That your life will go in, but you can never see her again, and won\u2019t go to her funeral. Then block her and move on with your life as best you can. I will pray for you.", "Yup, and if she tries to come to OP for help for whatever, they've got a perfect reason to turn her down.  Her reasoning for not letting OP choose a mememto of their father is BS.", "Yeah I feel that the reasons the relationship deteriorated might be relevant to this.", "That was op's dad, the mom wasn't the only one who had a family member die, literally what are you on?"]}
