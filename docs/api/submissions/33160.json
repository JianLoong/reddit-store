I found out the meaning of dyslexia at a young age, and since then, I believed I had it as I was struggling in school and most of the \"criteria\" for dyslexia. My parents didn't believe me and wouldn't pay for me to have an assessment done, and the school didn't, too. I was hesitant to start college as I struggled so much during school so I left it for a few years. \n\nLast year was an emotional year for me as I finally started college and the college I went to believed me in that I have dyslexia. The college I attend has a support fund for people with dyslexia, and they also pay for students' diagnoses; however, there's a waiting list of up to three months. As soon as I started my first year the college paid for my assessment to be done and whilst waiting for three months I struggled throughout as I wasn't eligible for any support. \n\nIn December 2022, I finally got diagnosed with dyslexia, and the college gave me their support package. My college also bought me dyslexia-friendly materials such as a diary that's been designed to be dyslexia-friendly and so on. Since then, with the help of these materials, I've been succeeding well and haven't had to use any extensions; I've attended all classes and stayed organised thanks to my dyslexia-friendly diary. \n\nEvery three months or so my college professors reveal who is at the top of the class and since December 2022 it has constantly been me. I've got 100% attendance, I've had top marks throughout my essays, I always do the enrichment activities and so on. I feel really proud of this achievement because I finally feel supported and believed. \n\nOn Tuesday of this week, my professor read out who's top of the class and I found out it's still me. I have a classmate who's very bright but she also has autism. She went into a meltdown over it being me and not her. The professor reads the whole list and she's in fourth place. My professors haven't explained why they do this and I still don't have any clue but I feel proud to be top of the class as I feel supported for once in my life. Although I'm top I do feel that quite a lot of people work hard in my class including this classmate but the professors said the stats show I work hard and she walked off upset.\n\nThis has now become a tense situation as my classmates are saying in paraphrasing terms that I'm an asshole because I'm not apologising for being top of the class. I don't see why I should apologise as I'm proud to be at the top. I video-called my mom and dad yesterday (who still don't believe my dyslexia diagnosis) and we caught up. I explained there was a situation at college and what happened and my parents said the same thing. \n\nWas I in the wrong for not apologising to a classmate for being top of the class and does this make me the asshole?", "created_utc": 1702753256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18jy10x/aita_for_for_not_apologising_to_my_autistic/", "score": 362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you kidding ? \n\nNTA and I wouldn't apologize. \n\nAlso I feel like that's a shitty ritual on the teachers part, to read that list aloud when people clearly are so affected by it. He could broach that subject personally with each student.", "NTA. The teacher is though. There is zero reason to announce who is 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. What does he hope to achieve by that?  All it does is create unnecessary drama between people. There is also no reason for you or anyone else who did better than her to apologize. You worked hard and did your best. Keep it up!", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe anyone an apology for working hard, doing extra work and being present for every class. \nTry to stop feeling guilty. You had nothing to do with the Professor's choices such as coercing him, cheating or anything. \n\nWe would all love to be recognized for our hard work but that doesn't always happen so we need to learn how to accept the things we cannot change. The only thing we can change is how we react to adverse events. \n\nCongratulations!!", "NTA. \n\nAs someone on the spectrum, I graduated with highest honors from my community college, and then as Summa Cum Laude from my four year, an achievement I was insanely proud of especially after my HS struggles. Much like you, I also was able to do this via college resources not available in HS. My college didn\u2019t post rankings, but I did get some awards and shit for honors society (some Greek organization\u2026I don\u2019t remember because it\u2019s silly now). \n\nNo one since college has asked about my GPA. No one cares where I ranked or my awards. They want to hear what I actually learned, not how I learned to work within the academic system. Everyone who got the same degree as me has an equal shot at jobs in our field. My close friend who struggled through college as a single mom now has the same career field as me, and despite graduating at the same time, she\u2019s actually a step above me in our profession. \n\nYour rankings don\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all arbitrary, and it\u2019s silly of your college to even post them or announce them like that. You don\u2019t need to apologize for it. If you say anything to your classmate it should be reaffirming that \u201cyou know at the end of this we will both have the same degree and are likely to end up in the same job field, right? Don\u2019t worry about where you rank now, just do your best and we will be there for each other in the professional world once this is all over.\u201d", "Are the second and third runners up being asked to apologize as well?

The girl should use it as inspiration to work harder against her disability, just like you have.", "Pretty sure FERPA applies in universities also. What country are you in? \n\nThis scenario makes no sense. Firstly, professors doing this would only cause division and damage the learning environment. Secondly, a university that seems so progressive about learning disabilities and mental health probably would have a policy against it. Then, if you\u2019re in the US, FERPA precludes such things as identifying students by name and their grades. At BEST, they might be allowed to post grades with an anonymous number known only to the student. But even then. Professors aren\u2019t even allowed to email grades because someone might see it who isn\u2019t the student/it\u2019s not secure enough. \n\nIF this story were even true, you wouldn\u2019t be TA; the professors would. But this is highly unlikely for various reasons.", "NTA  One of my professor's gave me the nickname \"Curvebuster\" and I wore it proudly. Like you, I put in the work to the best I could and it paid off. Agree with other posters that reading out rankings by the prof might not be the best thing, so really it's a them problem and not a you problem.", "You must attend a college outside the US or Canada because privacy laws would make this practice illegal here.", "??? NTA I simply don't understand why you should apologize to anyone for doing well, you're not hurting them, they're not missing out because you're the top of the class, there isn't a prize for being no.1. You succeeding doesn't affect them in any way, shape, or form. The MOST that it could possibly be affecting them is that they're bored of hearing your name every three months. But that's IT, you haven't done a thing wrong.  \n\n\nI'm happy for you getting the accommodations you need and doing well now, I hope this continues for you and the rest of college goes well.", ">My parents didn't believe me and wouldn't pay for me to have an assessment done, and the school didn't, too.\n\nI take it you\u2019re not in the US?  Testing for dyslexia in public schools is free, and if a teacher suspected you had it, they could initiate the request.\n\n>Every three months or so my college professors reveal who is at the top of the class and since December 2022 it has constantly been me.\n\nWhich \u201ccollege professors\u201d?  All of them? So multiple professors, in different classes, all have the same policy of violating student privacy and revealing what should be confidential information?  And in every single class you\u2019re taking in your second year in college, you\u2019re getting the highest grade?\n\nOkay.\n\n>The professor reads the whole list\n\nOh, so now we\u2019re violating the rights of EVERYONE in the class.  Marvelous.  What is the purpose of *reading* the list?  If he really wants to shame and embarrass the students who didn\u2019t do well, why can\u2019t he just post the list outside the classroom?  That way you can all gather there like a bunch of high school bullies and mock the losers at the bottom of the list.\n\n>the professors said the stats show I work hard\n\nThat is the biggest load of garbage I have ever heard.  I was a geology TA for years.  High marks don\u2019t necessarily mean someone has \u201cworked hard\u201d, and no professor I know would ever say such an asinine thing.  All high marks mean is that you completed the assignments and knew the material.  Which is great, don\u2019t get me wrong - but if someone is a quick study, they could have gotten those same grades with a lot less effort than you put in.  Someone who studies for hours every day, but has terrible test anxiety - do they not \u201cwork hard\u201d?  Of course they do.  But their grades may not reflect it because their anxiety affects their performance.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re an AH.  I suspect you\u2019re a liar.  If any of these professors turn out to be real, they wouldn\u2019t last a week in the US before they\u2019d get fired for multiple FERPA violations.", "Nta, why in the world would you apologise. Apologise for studying hard and attending every class. I don't think you should apologize. Its your hard earned position.", "Do you know if your classmate is equally accommodated?

Top grades sighting beating someone out by a slight percentage shouldn't lead to others feeling less than...", "NTA\n\nYou work hard to succeed.

You're very hard-working & have every right to take pride in being top of your class. It's admirable. This chick has an obvious hang up about not being on top, but that's not your business or responsibility. We are ONLY responsible for ourselves. Don't apologize. Anyone who says differently can fuck off. Keep up the great work.", "NTA - You should never apologise for working hard and being successful. It is weird that the professor read the whole list though, and idk how I feel about doing the \"Top student\" thing in front of the whole class, but that's on them, not you.

It would be a massive FERPA violation.", "Obviously you don't owe anyone an apology for doing well, but if there are multiple people telling you that you should apologise, i wonder if it's actually about something slightly different- is it possible that you came across as 'crowing ' over your classmate and that it is more about how you are perceived to have reacted, than the fact you came top, which they are reacting to?", "NTA. Teacher is, though. This is not college-level appropriate behavior. Everyone should be proud of their hard work and do their best, not spend all this emotional energy on something that will not matter in the long run.

Some other kid got recognized for having a 4.3 ( I don't know how the hell that happens- I guess it's the new math) the entire 1st semester.

Way to go.", "This is what happens when an entire generation is given trophies and praise for just participating. You owe nobody an apology for working hard and succeeding... Ever.

This did not happen.", "It's a dumb dumb policy to announce it but you should never apologize for being better than someone else. You work harder...even if she wasn't autistic it doesn't mean she'd be the best.\n\nWHat do they want participation trophy?", "NTA. I am apalled at the thought! Just because someone is autistic that doesn't give them the right to be AHs. I get it that she can't control her meltdowns, but once that is over she must have coping strategies to pick up and move on. Her not being able to cope with being number 4 is on her, not on the people who did better than her. \n\nOnce that is said, I have to say that I hate the idea of reading out in class who did best, who came in second etc. It is oldfashioned, irrelevant and not good for learning. As long as everyone is learning to the best of their ability that should be fine. Once you hit the job market it doesn't matter one iota who did best in class. It will be all about how you do your job. If anyone should apologize it should be the college for its outdated methods of motivating students.", "NTA. I agree with others that it is a weird thing for your college to do. But if it is going to do it, your classmate is going to have to find ways to manage her disappointment.
