I did and my colleague made an instagram post about their new home office. It blew up and more of their acquaintances asked me to help them. This time they paid. I started an IG account. soon I did home offices and gyms. When people started going back to work I started designing for companies.

Your SIL is being told she\u2019s jealous all the time because she is jealous & apparently you aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s noticed. Did your husband actually say those things though? If so, then he absolutely sucks too. But you\u2019re his wife & she clearly has a pattern, so don\u2019t feel so bad about not scolding him in public. If he really feels that way though, you have bigger issues than just your SIL\u2019s feelings. Why hadn\u2019t he been honest with you about it? Is he really that threatened by your success?

She tried to hurt and humiliate you at the table and that's not ok. She also tried to minimize your accomplishments. You should be proud of what you have achieved and your husband should also be proud. Definitely talk to the husband because him talking about you behind your back to her like that is a red flag. Feels like both SIL and husband are jealous imo.", "Question: did you ask your husband if he said anything to SIL?", "NTA she fully is the AH she insulted you and you responded in a pretty calm way.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t say anything equally as disrespectful as her. Trying to minimize your new company and success and you calling her a jealous bitch is not on the same level. You should still speak with your husband, but I think you acted appropriately. She called you out, you told her to stuff it. If she can\u2019t be called jealous then she has some personal issues. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone breaking down and crying after being called jealous. What a child.", "NTA don't you dare apologize. Your husband's TA for talking behind your back to his sister, and his sister's TA for weaponizing a private convo about her brother's obvious insecurities in public to humiliate you. She \\*is\\* jealous and petty, and if she can't take it, she sure as hell shouldn't dish it out", "NTA. \n Congrats on your success. Keep going. \n\nShe can dish it, but can't take it. People like her need to be put in her place or she'll keep going and it'll only get worse. And why is it that she hates being called jealousy? Maybe she displays that behavior all the time. As they say, if the shoe fits. \n\nNow, what did your husband say during and after all this?", "NTA. She insulted you in public and you took a stand for yourself. You didn\u2019t know that she was saying that because your husband said so. However, you should apologise to her once since she was just quoting what she was told. Husband sounds like the asshole to me :)", "nta, By her doubling down saying \"no ask hin\" after you said she was being hurtful, she was asking for it. She made what she knew knowledge, she didn't need to keep hammering away.", "NTA but your husband & your sister sure are. Your husband is a lector - not a professor of any kind - at a university. You are a successful business person & entrepreneur. It sounds like your husband is also jealous of your success, & in a mean back biting \u201cI will reap the financial rewards of my wife\u2019s success & then back stab & insult her so I don\u2019t feel too emasculated\u201d kind of way. If you don\u2019t want to apologize to your SIL, keep in mind that if you divorce your husband, you will probably never have to see her again.", "NTA.  You need to talk to your husband and see whats up with him and  yes she jealous  so ignore her.", "NTA. It really doesn't matter what your husband told his sister in private, your sister tried to embarrass you in front of the whole family. Whether that weapon was given to her by her brother is inconsequential.", "NTA - she and your husband are though. Maybe instead of whining to his sister he should be talking to you about how he feels. He gave her the ammo and she used it. In addition to being jealous she's also insecure and petty.", "My dear, you are the one person in this scenario who is definitely NTA. I won\u2019t go so far as to call the others at the table assholes per se (with the exception of the husband type person), but any of them could have told her she was being inappropriate. Husband and SIL were just truly the co-stars of The Asshole Show. Husband never should\u2019ve been saying those things to his sister rather than using his big boy words to talk to his wife. That right there seriously needs to be addressed not now, but RIGHT now. As for SIL, I would very sweetly ask: so why do you think you feel so inadequate as a human being that you have to arbitrarily attack others to feel good?  Is there something that I could do to help you get horny rich men to flirt with you so that you don\u2019t feel the need to project your FOMO onto others?  How much attention do you need and how often do you need it to feel emotionally stable enough to sit at the grown ups table?  I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019ll either have a meltdown and leave or blow up and leave. Either way, she leaves and you guys enjoy your meal lol", "You? NTA. \nYour husband and SIL? Totally are. \n\nHonestly sounds like they\u2019re both immature and jealous. I wouldn\u2019t apologize personally. It\u2019s apparent she needed boundaries on being disrespectful to you.

Even if your husband did say it, she made the decision to bring it up in a public setting. What did she hope to gain by doing so ? Humiliate you ? You had a right to be mad at her.

She always had that option of talking to you privately about it, but nooooooo.\n\nNow for your husband, if he had a problem with it, he should have told you. Honestly, I am more insulted for you that he attributed your success to rich men being horny. I mean you did not start with wanting to build a business, but people enjoyed your services enough to talk to others and it snowballed from there. Also, I saw your comment about your husband thinking your new job was beneath you... How come ? Last time I checked a job is a job. Whether you are someone who is a janitor, a plumber, a doctor or working in a factory... A job is a job. Last time I checked, I might be university educated, but I still need a freaking plumber because I have no clue what to do if I have issues with my toilet pass the basics...", "NTA.

If anyone talked about me like your husband talked about you, my husband would flip his shit. thats what a spouse is meant to do. \n\nyour husband actively looked down on you and likely still does because dudes like this Do Not Change.\n\nplz have some self respect and reevaluate your relationship because people who love you dont talk shit about you like that\n\nediting to add: op you realise the actual jealous person is your husband right and its not about other men. The age difference and very direct job comparison of him (elite! professor!) vs you (regular old teacher) - this is a man who has had his perceived superioty shifted and honestly? gross af.

Yep your husband is an asshole, too, and they were his words but she weaponized it to attack you in public because she IS jealous. So what she made herself cry. She needs to own up to that jealousy and stop attacking other people for being successful. Your husband needs a serious come to jesus moment too. Hope he isn't benefiting off of your work and you've got it securely in an account just for you if he's feeling that way and saying it to other people.

We've all encountered the kinds of faculty who lord their knowledge and position over others to attempt to reconcile their insignificance with their ego.  I advise and support the students that they harm daily, and I try to work with my advisees to improve their resilience and to empower them to find their unique presence so that some petulant child in a suit can't disrupt their sense of self. \n\nYou are a creative, an artist, a designer, a teacher.

The husband is the real AH but SIL is far from innocent.
