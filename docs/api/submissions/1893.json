And I know for a fact that my SIL hates it when people tell her that she is jealous, especially of me. But I was very hurt and embarrassed. \n\nI'm a teacher from the start(f38). High school, math and chemistry. I loved my job. My husband is a lector at university(m51). We have two children. SIL (f39) is also a teacher. \n\nI have always loved interior design. Our apartment is something people talk about all the time. People (relatives friends etc) always ask me to help them design their homes. When the pandemic hit and people started working from home, a colleague of mine asked me to help her design her husbands home office. I did and my colleague made an instagram post about their new home office. It blew up and more of their acquaintances asked me to help them. This time they paid. I started an IG account. soon I did home offices and gyms. When people started going back to work I started designing for companies. Now I even do restaurants, hotels etc. I left my teaching job in the start of this year. I have also been developing homegym furniture that will be launched next year. \n\nWe had dinner at my in laws last Sunday. That's when MIL started talking about my company to her friends. SIL got very irritated and said that my clients are only horny rich men that wanted to flirt with me. I felt a lump in my throat because everyone was listening in shock. She said its true ask (my husbands name), he told me that. I told her that she was being hurtful. That I work hard for my company. She said NO ASK HIM (about my husband), he won't stop whining about how he hates your new hobby. I told her that I aways knew that she is a bitter jealous b it c h but that this is a new low and that I'm tired of it. She started crying because she hated that people always tell her that she is jealous.\n\nWhen I got home I felt bad. I embarrassed her where she is most sensitive and in front of everybody.

Don't apologize. She intentionally picked a time that would be humiliating for you, and tried to get your husband to back her up on insulting you. Even if he had said it, he sure didn't in front of a bunch of people. \n\nAlso, your husband is a dick for not standing up for you, you should have a really candid thought about the way he treats you!", "NTA. Your SIL is being told she\u2019s jealous all the time because she is jealous & apparently you aren\u2019t the only one who\u2019s noticed. Did your husband actually say those things though? If so, then he absolutely sucks too. But you\u2019re his wife & she clearly has a pattern, so don\u2019t feel so bad about not scolding him in public. If he really feels that way though, you have bigger issues than just your SIL\u2019s feelings. Why hadn\u2019t he been honest with you about it? Is he really that threatened by your success? Regardless, you\u2019ve done nothing wrong based off this info other than marry into a dysfunctional family.", "NTA, but your husband and SIL are.", "Your husband may have said those things, but she didn't need to repeat them. She tried to hurt and humiliate you at the table and that's not ok. She also tried to minimize your accomplishments. You should be proud of what you have achieved and your husband should also be proud. Definitely talk to the husband because him talking about you behind your back to her like that is a red flag. Feels like both SIL and husband are jealous imo.", "Question: did you ask your husband if he said anything to SIL?", "NTA she fully is the AH she insulted you and you responded in a pretty calm way.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t say anything equally as disrespectful as her. Trying to minimize your new company and success and you calling her a jealous bitch is not on the same level. You should still speak with your husband, but I think you acted appropriately. She called you out, you told her to stuff it. If she can\u2019t be called jealous then she has some personal issues. I\u2019ve never heard of anyone breaking down and crying after being called jealous. What a child.", "NTA don't you dare apologize. Your husband's TA for talking behind your back to his sister, and his sister's TA for weaponizing a private convo about her brother's obvious insecurities in public to humiliate you. She \\*is\\* jealous and petty, and if she can't take it, she sure as hell shouldn't dish it out", "NTA. \n Congrats on your success. Keep going. \n\nShe can dish it, but can't take it. People like her need to be put in her place or she'll keep going and it'll only get worse. And why is it that she hates being called jealousy? Maybe she displays that behavior all the time. As they say, if the shoe fits. \n\nNow, what did your husband say during and after all this?", "NTA. She insulted you in public and you took a stand for yourself. You didn\u2019t know that she was saying that because your husband said so. However, you should apologise to her once since she was just quoting what she was told. Husband sounds like the asshole to me :)", "nta, By her doubling down saying \"no ask hin\" after you said she was being hurtful, she was asking for it. She made what she knew knowledge, she didn't need to keep hammering away.", "NTA but your husband & your sister sure are. Your husband is a lector - not a professor of any kind - at a university. You are a successful business person & entrepreneur. It sounds like your husband is also jealous of your success, & in a mean back biting \u201cI will reap the financial rewards of my wife\u2019s success & then back stab & insult her so I don\u2019t feel too emasculated\u201d kind of way. If you don\u2019t want to apologize to your SIL, keep in mind that if you divorce your husband, you will probably never have to see her again.", "NTA.  You need to talk to your husband and see whats up with him and  yes she jealous  so ignore her.", "NTA. It really doesn't matter what your husband told his sister in private, your sister tried to embarrass you in front of the whole family. Whether that weapon was given to her by her brother is inconsequential.", "NTA - she and your husband are though. Maybe instead of whining to his sister he should be talking to you about how he feels. He gave her the ammo and she used it. In addition to being jealous she's also insecure and petty.", "My dear, you are the one person in this scenario who is definitely NTA. I won\u2019t go so far as to call the others at the table assholes per se (with the exception of the husband type person), but any of them could have told her she was being inappropriate. Husband and SIL were just truly the co-stars of The Asshole Show. Husband never should\u2019ve been saying those things to his sister rather than using his big boy words to talk to his wife. That right there seriously needs to be addressed not now, but RIGHT now. As for SIL, I would very sweetly ask: so why do you think you feel so inadequate as a human being that you have to arbitrarily attack others to feel good?  Is there something that I could do to help you get horny rich men to flirt with you so that you don\u2019t feel the need to project your FOMO onto others?  How much attention do you need and how often do you need it to feel emotionally stable enough to sit at the grown ups table?  I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019ll either have a meltdown and leave or blow up and leave. Either way, she leaves and you guys enjoy your meal lol", "You? NTA. \nYour husband and SIL? Totally are. \n\nHonestly sounds like they\u2019re both immature and jealous. I wouldn\u2019t apologize personally. It\u2019s apparent she needed boundaries on being disrespectful to you. I\u2019m sure this certainly put some in place. \n\nGood luck with your business \u2665\ufe0f", "You know if you drop the husband you won\u2019t have to deal with a shorty sil anymore\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your husband should have said something. He's allowed to vent and maybe he's telling the truth that it was just in the beginning but he should have shut SIL down.\n\nSIL is jealous and threw both of you under the bus. Not sure what she thought would happen but she knew that saying it would hurt both of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, I also think that you need to have a conversation with your jealous husband as well and let him know what you think about what he said.", "NTA\n\nyou stood up for yourself. If she can't handle being told off in public, she shouldn't be rude in public.\n\nBut you \\*need\\* to talk to your husband and find out if he really is going around saying what she suggested. He should have stood up for you too", "First she brought that onto herself.  She chose the place and manner in which to confront you.  She likely thought your husband would back her up, which leads to how bitterly he IS talking about you to his friends and family.  Which leads to you needing to consider what's going on with your husband.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your husband and sil are. Obviously she is jealous of your success. You need to sit down with your husband because saying those things about you is really disrespectful.", "NTA and please don't apologize.  You need an apology from not only her but your husband.  Have you talked to him about what the SIL said?  If she is repeating something he said then you have a bigger problem on your hands.", "What was your husband doing/saying while she was saying this?", "NTA. Even if your husband did say it, she made the decision to bring it up in a public setting. What did she hope to gain by doing so ? Humiliate you ? You had a right to be mad at her. It is like kicking a hornets nest and hoping nothing will sting you. She had it coming. She always had that option of talking to you privately about it, but nooooooo.\n\nNow for your husband, if he had a problem with it, he should have told you. Honestly, I am more insulted for you that he attributed your success to rich men being horny. I mean you did not start with wanting to build a business, but people enjoyed your services enough to talk to others and it snowballed from there. Also, I saw your comment about your husband thinking your new job was beneath you... How come ? Last time I checked a job is a job. Whether you are someone who is a janitor, a plumber, a doctor or working in a factory... A job is a job. Last time I checked, I might be university educated, but I still need a freaking plumber because I have no clue what to do if I have issues with my toilet pass the basics...", "NTA. She is the one who chose to say something in front of everyone. If she had come to you in private without everyone around I'm sure you would have reacted differently. They are both jealous of your success. Congratulations on creating a sucessful business during such a crazy time in everyone's lives. It couldn't have been easy and I know it had to take it's toll on you both mentally and physically.", "NTA your SIL and husband are clearly cut from the same shitty cloth.", "NTA don't let those fake tears get to you. Don't apologize to her. If anything she needs to apologize to you. Also, your husband is the main cause of this here. Don't let him off the hook especially after his explanations. He sounds just as jealous as his sister and needs a reality check. Good luck and be careful, you have snakes in your grass.", "He didn't stand up for me because that is what he really had told his sister. when I confronted him he swore  it was just in the beginning. Because the vast majority of my my clients were men", "yes my husband did say this. that's why I was thinking maybe she was just innocent because these are my husbands words", "Yes, and she wasn't lying. I never knew until we got home and I confronted him.", "He didn't say anything. He looked like a deer in headlights. and shook his head to signal stop this. but I confronted him at home and apparently he doesn't think my work has the dignity of my previous teaching job", "that doesnt make it better. he trashed you over something you clearly not only enjoyed but were good at. If anyone talked about me like your husband talked about you, my husband would flip his shit. thats what a spouse is meant to do. \n\nyour husband actively looked down on you and likely still does because dudes like this Do Not Change.\n\nplz have some self respect and reevaluate your relationship because people who love you dont talk shit about you like that\n\nediting to add: op you realise the actual jealous person is your husband right and its not about other men. The age difference and very direct job comparison of him (elite! professor!) vs you (regular old teacher) - this is a man who has had his perceived superioty shifted and honestly? gross af. Dude has thought himself better than you all this time and shits coming out cos you're succeeding and it threatens him. GROOOOSSSSS  unmarry him.", "Your SIL is not innocent. She chose to repeat this hurtful slander in the most hurtful way possible. Also, she said it as if it was her opinion, as if she actually believed it.\n\nOk, time for a weird metaphor. Your husband gave her an axe, and he shouldn't have. You have to settle this with your husband. But your SIL, she grabbed the axe, and she tried to decapitate you with it. She could have left the axe in a drawer. She could have said, hey, between you and me, your husband gave me this axe, maybe you should have a talk. She could have thrown the axe away.\n\nBut no! She chose to take it and hurt you with it. You have nothing to apologize for.", "Neither of them are innocent here and I\u2019m honestly so sorry you\u2019re receiving such hate from people who should be supportive & proud right now. How did he react from your private convo about it?", "No she wasn't innocent.  She did that on purpose and your husband allowed it.  Please don't apologize.  They should be apologizing to you and your husband is also an AH,", "NTA\n\nBut your husband is an AH because he should have spoken to you instead of involving SIL. She sounds jealous and he just gave her information to use against you", "Sounds like he's jealous too to be honest.", "I don\u2019t buy it. He\u2019s insecure you make more than him now. He\u2019s no longer the \u2018man\u2019 of the house. Plus he\u2019s insecure in your relationship. By this logic, you should be upset he\u2019s around 18-22 year old women who only take his courses to flirt with him. See how ridiculous and demeaning that sounds? Why would you want to stay married to a man that doesn\u2019t respect you and blames you for his insecurities?", "true! thank you. she did swing the axe didn't she", "Oh yes! She did! And as you reacted strongly, to say the least, maybe she will hesitate before attacking you next time. Good for you for standing up for yourself. Honestly, I think you did everything right. \n\nAlso, everyone is always saying your SIL is jealous? Gee, I wonder why! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEditing to add: she also chose to swing the axe in public. In the presence of your in-laws. To humiliate you as much as she could."]}
