He works while I get to be a SAHM with the kids. We made that decision when I got pregnant with our first. He didn\u2019t want me working and I didn\u2019t want to leave our child with someone else so it worked out perfectly. \nNow because I\u2019m a SAHM I do all the chores and cooking around the house which I don\u2019t mind along with teaching/playing with the kids, and I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s perfect because no relationship is but it\u2019s pretty close. \nMy mother came over the other day to spend some time with the kids before my husband got home from work (we never know when he will get off but always lets us know when he is on his way home) anyways my husband came home early that day and walked into the house, said hello to everyone and after hugs and kisses from the kids he sat down to relax. \nI went over and started to take his boots off(we have an agreement if I take his boots off he rubs my back later) and as I started my mom just blurts out \u201cWhat do you think your doing? He\u2019s a grown man he can take his own shoes off!\u201d \nI replied very calmly and said \u201cMomma is ok, I do it all the time and I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nMom says \u201cWell don\u2019t let him treat you like a slave. Your better than that. You deserve better!\u201d\nI snapped and whisper y yelled back to her \u201cShut up and mind your own business. My husband works hard all day long from the crack of dawn until dark and the least I can do is take his boots off after a hard day.\u201d\nShe called me ungrateful, a brat, an AH and basically stupid for being with him. She never really like him because we got pregnant before we were married and in her eyes he ruined my life, but I see it as he saved me and now I can live the life I actually want. \nSo AITH for telling my mom to shut up for judging my relationship?", "created_utc": 1696879729, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1740n28/aita_for_telling_my_mother_to_shut_up_and_mind/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
