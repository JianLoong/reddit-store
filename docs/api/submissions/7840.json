Have him come visit and in general they are a cuddly bunch of siblings. Nothing weird about it. \n\nIn a healthy sibling relationship with a large age gap showing interest and staying connected is normal. \n\nMy youngest sister was adopted and is only a year older than my oldest child. \n\nWTF is wrong with you and your family relationships that causes you to be so suspicious of your gf? \n\nAnd do you really think that a pregnancy at 16 would not leave tell tale signs on your gfs body?", "YTA.

Isn't that WEIRD?! I thought my 25 year old girlfriend was her 8 year old brother's MOM, because she LOVES him.\"\n\nYou're depressing.

Of course they're like mother and son, she's 18 years older than him. That doesn't mean she is his mother. She sounds like a caring and loving big sis.

No, because that is a weird place to go", "YTA\nthey have an 18 year age difference. Of course she will take a more motherly, adult role in his life.
