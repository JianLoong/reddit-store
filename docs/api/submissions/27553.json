They were staying up north with another cousin, and wanted to come down to visit my wife\u2019s mother (who is currently staying at my wife\u2019s sister\u2019s house). Both us and my wife\u2019s sister live 15 minutes apart. My wife\u2019s sister invited them over to stay at her apartment. Now a week before they are about to come, my wife\u2019s sister asked if we can host them instead, since we have a bigger house (We have a 4 bedroom vs 2 bedroom). I said no because I work from home (my wife works at the hospital) and we were not planning for this. We don\u2019t have any kids, so then it would just be me and her cousins family staying at our house on the weekdays where I will be occupied with work. My wife\u2019s sister said that they will visit her house during the day, but that they would just need a place to sleep. However, I don\u2019t know how true this would really be. I also have never met any of these people, and this would be the first time I am meeting my wife\u2019s cousin and her family. I don\u2019t know how her kid is behaved or not, nor is our house as kid friendly. I mentioned to my wife that had we known in advance (say a month prior) we could\u2019ve accommodated and mentally prepared. Now my wife\u2019s sister is calling me (through my wife via text) that I am selfish and not the \u201cgood guy\u201d. My wife defends me, but I hate that this is causing a rift between close sisters because of a last minute change of plans. My wife\u2019s birthday is this coming week, and because of this my wife\u2019s sister and her family have decided not to come over to her birthday party\u2026 which feels like blackmail IMO. I am typically reserved when it comes to inviting people to stay over for a week at our house, but I don\u2019t like the emotional gymnastics that my SIL is playing with my wife. Am I the Asshole?\n\n\nUpdate: So we reached out to my SIL and I offered to pay for 75% of a nearby AirBNB (Am also open to paying 100% to squash any beef), but no text response back. Later, my wife was talking to my MIL with this proposed idea, and my SIL said \u201cWe are not doing an AirBNB\u201d. I have offered to host my MIL, but she also wants to be with my wife\u2019s cousin\u2019s family. \n\nSome more context: I am Indian and understand the desi culture, however I am still for setting boundaries and respecting others\u2019 comfort levels. My MIL jumps between the 2 households, where for the previous 6 months she was staying with us. I work from home during the day, where my computer is a hefty desktop, so moving the office setup is unfortunately not an option. Had I known more in advance, I could\u2019ve taken PTO. Had my in-laws planned with better communication, we could\u2019ve agreed on dates that worked for everyone (such as coming over Thanksgiving break - where I would\u2019ve had the week off).", "created_utc": 1695576857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16r3kdy/aita_for_not_allowing_my_wifes_cousins_family_to/", "score": 427, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean we have no idea the times he works. And if people really think he won't be bothered if they are there when he is working then they are delusional. The kids being kids. The family wanting who knows what. Or to go wherever. He as he is home will be the one expected to drop everything to cater to them. \n\nDo we know when thwyvqill go to bed.

So she knew what she was doing when she popped this on them a week beforehand. That is manipulation on all counts and would inform them that fine but don't expect any help from him.

I do not know if I would want a bunch of strangers being in my house (including some of the cousins I do not know very well).", "Yeah, you've made your point. I've made my point. I'm not going to change my mind because you rephrase the post for me. I can assure you, I have plenty of experience hosting company, including people I know well, people I don't know at all, and people from Pakistan. Pakistanis are among the most gracious hosts you'll meet in the world. It will absolutely be an insult if OP doesn't compromise to accommodate his wife's family.", "You must be a child\u2026a week of AirBnB will be several hundred dollars in every place I have ever gone in the developed world. \n\nPeople being so antisocial is probably why American\u2019s have more mass-shooting than days in the year.\n\nYou really need to learn something about other cultures\u2026then you might understand why isolating the visiting family in a home alone is also a bit rude. Hosting very much part of their culture. \n\nThis might just be the reason that they have a rift with her family. Hope they never decide to have kids and that they never need a favour themselves.", "Well then maybe you can volunteer to host OPs unwanted guests. Lol. His wife isn\u2019t even asking him to do this, meaning she probably doesn\u2019t want them there either. Being a part of another culture doesn\u2019t give you a free pass to impose on someone in their home if they don\u2019t want you there.", "YTA", "He shouldn\u2019t have to make back up plans for HOS OWN HOUSE!!!!!! It\u2019s also his work place. Also everyone seems to be acting like his wife is the one that wants this but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s his SIL. This is her problem not theirs.", "Actually it is not very last minute. They have a weeks time. In a normal Indian household, that is plenty of time to arrange for the visit. I am guessing it will be the same for Pakistani household too.\n\nUnless they want to child proof of remodel the house for visitors.", "so you think. I'd like some references please. lol", "He has said that he would have taken PTO from work, or planned days when he wouldn\u2019t have been working all day."]}
