They were staying up north with another cousin, and wanted to come down to visit my wife\u2019s mother (who is currently staying at my wife\u2019s sister\u2019s house). Both us and my wife\u2019s sister live 15 minutes apart. My wife\u2019s sister invited them over to stay at her apartment. Now a week before they are about to come, my wife\u2019s sister asked if we can host them instead, since we have a bigger house (We have a 4 bedroom vs 2 bedroom). I said no because I work from home (my wife works at the hospital) and we were not planning for this. We don\u2019t have any kids, so then it would just be me and her cousins family staying at our house on the weekdays where I will be occupied with work. My wife\u2019s sister said that they will visit her house during the day, but that they would just need a place to sleep. However, I don\u2019t know how true this would really be. I also have never met any of these people, and this would be the first time I am meeting my wife\u2019s cousin and her family. I don\u2019t know how her kid is behaved or not, nor is our house as kid friendly. I mentioned to my wife that had we known in advance (say a month prior) we could\u2019ve accommodated and mentally prepared. Now my wife\u2019s sister is calling me (through my wife via text) that I am selfish and not the \u201cgood guy\u201d.

Family matters and to force them to fit that many people into a 2 bedroom apartment when you have a comfortable space for them? Not to mention the \u201cface\u201d aspect of it. When my family in Atlanta hosts, it was always at my uncle with the biggest house\u2019s place because in the culture, appearances matter and even if the sister is in an apartment with her mom, your wife and her family members will want to show that at least one of them is well settled. This would be a good time to bend a little because it doesn\u2019t cost you much to make some room for a week but it IS a big deal to your wife\u2019s family.", "Nta\n\nIt has NOTHING to do with cultural differences here.\n\nIt's a basic fact. No matter the culture you do not suddenly spring this on someone. You do not offer someone else's home up to visitors after your was agreed on. That's not culture l. That's being rude af.\n\nIt's easy to say you have more room. It makes sense. But he has never met these people. The sister has said they will be with her during the day. She also said they would be staying with her. How soon will that change. \n\nHe works from home. How often will he be interrupted because they need something. Such as extra towels or toilet paper. I mean we have no idea the times he works. And if people really think he won't be bothered if they are there when he is working then they are delusional. The kids being kids. The family wanting who knows what. Or to go wherever. He as he is home will be the one expected to drop everything to cater to them. \n\nDo we know when thwyvqill go to bed. Will the baby sleep through the night. Yes it's a week but he needs sleep as it's not his kid so he should suffer because he has more room. \n\nDo you really think they won't want breakfast made before they go to sisters house. Won't want time and to hosted as normally someone would? So he should suck it up and be cleaning up after people that are not even immediate family. Catering to them. Expected to put aside his work for their needs? Because soon enough sisters place is to small for all so we should just go back to OP. Oh sister needs a break so now suddenly op needs to host them for the day. \n\nSo he should make himself uncomfortable in his own home. Have no idea what will be expected or demanded of him. Because he married into a cultural family. Well that family also married into his culture. He has a right to not want strangers in his home. To not want to be guilted by them not coming to wife's bd party because he expects people to hold up to their side of agreement.\n\nI am sorry but the moment they said they wouldn't come I would be putting my foot down. Telling them because they think they can make decisions concerning his home and then call him an ah when he doesn't agree to it. Because they can cut off coming and celebrating his wife birthday because they didn't get their way. And sorry sister knew she lived in a two bedroom. So she knew what she was doing when she popped this on them a week beforehand. That is manipulation on all counts and would inform them that fine but don't expect any help from him. His home will now be off limits to them all. And wife can visit as she wishes but you will not let them treat you like that. Treat her like that and accept that it's their culture. Because abuse and manipulation is not culture. It's people wanting others to bow to their demands and when they don't they punish them. You and wife don't need that in your life.", "YTA. As a middle easterner you're giving me the yuck. This is very misogynistic and abuse of your power as a husband", "Can you help put in some money for them to stay at a hotel? Since it's just to sleep(according to SIL)-it doesn't need to be a top line hotel.\n\nI won't say that you are the AH, because you weren't given warning and you always have a right to the two yes/one no on overnight(+) guests.\n\nI am sad for your wife too--since sister is being an AH(refusing to attend her party because of this).  And I admit, that would make me take an even harder line(rather than give in).  I don't give in to blackmail(or hostage taking).", "NTA. This is your home, and you and your wife are the ones who should extend an invitation to stay if that's what you want to do. That is not your SIL's prerogative.", "NTA, and you need to establish boundaries with SIL so this never happens again.\n\nBan the cousins from your house and do not attempt to visit with them. Your wife shouldn't, either. Make SIL realize that she can't go around flinging insults at you just because you WON'T GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHEN SHE COMMANDS IT.", "NTA. Tell your wife's sister that she's free to talk to you about this and not drag your wife into the middle.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister invited her family to stay at YOUR house and only decided to let you in on the little secret a week in advance.", "NTA. Take your wife out for nice evening on her birthday.", "NTAH, you work from home, that did it for me.", "NTA your house is your workspace, I'd bet money absolutely none of them would be respectful of that", "It doesn't matter. You'll be the ass no matter what because you are going against cultural norms.\n\nI would hate to be in your shoes since I'd freak out too. I don't share personal space well and I'm big on planning ahead. Good luck!", "YTA. You married someone from a different culture, with different and specific expectations of how to treat family, and you're not finding a way to compromise with your wife and her family to make sure you aren't insulting them. It's a week; a week is really not that long. It's certainly not so long that you can't set expectations and make backup plans for yourself if you find things are too stressful for you in the house. They aren't strangers, they are family you haven't yet met. It's your wife's house too. When did it become acceptable to refuse to be a little inconvenienced by family, of all things?", "NTA\n\nShe invited and offered them a place, she's being incredibly rude trying to offload them as guests into your house without notice or consent.\n\nWhere's the rest of the family to step up? Why is it YOUR job now?", "Why doesn't the sister ask if she and the mother can sleep at your house instead? Then you don't have to worry about childproofing nor children/guests you don't know interrupting your worktime. Could you accept that as a compromise?", "Culturally, you can\u2019t ask people to stay at a hotel. It\u2019s seen as incredibly rude and conversely most people won\u2019t go to a hotel proactively for fear of offending the host who may genuinely want to do their best to take care of them even if the offerings are humble. Generally, people just scrunch in and sleep where they can if space is an issue and yes, draw on nearby relatives\u2019 homes for extra space like what OP\u2019s in laws are proposing. Really sucks for introverts like myself, family gatherings can be hellish with 30 people all packed into one house.  Remember, for some cultures, possessions and space aren\u2019t individual by default and it\u2019s generally assumed that you\u2019ll help each other out.", "Cause she planned to pawn them in the sister.", "It needs discussion. SIL lives 15 min away and she can pick them in the morning and they return for night. It needs to be discussed and agreed upon.", "This is absolutely what would happen.", "This", "OP shouldn\u2019t have to leave his own home to accommodate guests he never invited or wanted to host in the first place!! If anything the five family members can stay in an airbnb", "I bet the plan was for the family to stay with OP from the very beginning. Making it a last minute emergency was always the plan.", "I think you are making some very strong assumptions about 6 year olds. \n\nSome may be quiet and well behaved and some are absolute terrors that will get into anything that isn\u2019t locked up.", "\\*fair\\* to ask", "It's not just his home, it's his workplace too. He needs peace and quiet, presumably, to do his job and, having the bigger place, others would likely decide to show up there instead of going elsewhere.", "Yep, cultural differences here mean that if he does not host then whole family will be gossiping about it and it will cause drama. Also a week is more than enough notice to prepare, a months notice is just an excuse. OP not an AH for wanting own space but needs to \u2018man up\u2019 and use legitimate reasons and live with consequence.", "Tell me you\u2019ve never met a 6 yo without telling me you\u2019ve never met a 6 yo.", "My mom comes over for a few hours once a week to help me with laundry, and I have to do all the prep of collecting the clothes and baskets, explain what to wash, take her to lunch and then refold and put away the clothes because she won't do them as I prefer. This is her helping me. Imagine how it is when I take her along on our family vacations. \ud83d\ude11", "Sometimes they don\u2019t understand how cleaning works. One on my friend had his wood floor washed with hot water because coding family wanted to clean up after them selves.", "Maybe SIL and MIL would do the cooking and wash dishes at OP\u2019s house. It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s a compromise. Wifey can clean up after they leave.", "Lol this way of thinking is the problem.", "This is a great idea! That way one one person is traveling to her place for the \u201cday\u201d visit and I bet $100 the SIL and MIL would just come to your house for the day visit and leave when they needed to sleep.", "That is very true", "There's a lot of information in here that I didn't see in OP's comment. You really can't presume to know anything about the family, let alone that the matriarch will be overbearing, that they don't speak English, or that they aren't accustomed to people working from home.", "Are Pakistanis matriarchal? I tend to doubt it.", "No it doesn\u2019t. OP seems to have decided they aren\u2019t coming.", "From a cultural standpoint, putting the relatives in a hotel is a no no. That's why I suggested he go.", "Oh wow that didn\u2019t cross my mind. If that\u2019s true, that\u2019s just pathetic", "Depends on the newborn. My oldest was sleeping through the night at 9 weeks and was a quiet baby. Her sister was a terrible sleeper but even her crying couldn't be heard from my parents guest bedroom until I opened the door. She wasn't too bad during the day. It's only a week and it's family.", "That part. Loud, destructive little hellions.", "I was about to say - some of the stories in this sub about kids!!!", "The real question is, which consequences does he want to live with? The family gossiping about him, or being a pushover for the SIL. Does he really want to set a precedent of SIL inviting family, then telling him they have to stay with him? \n\nI'd rather have the family gossip about me until someone else commits the next faux pas everyone else will gossip about \n\nStand your ground.", "Without knowing OP\u2019s day to day schedule it\u2019s not easy to determine whether or not a week is sufficient time to prepare a house and grocery shop for a family of 5. Plus working remotely can be difficult with distractions especially when used to being alone.", "Work is a legitimate excuse. It\u2019s his livelihood.", "I got 3 kids on my own. Just to be clear. What can I say mine and their friends are not little AH. I am sorry if yours are.", "I have a 6 year old with ADHD. She's generally well behaved and she listens well.", "You seem to have phrased that wrong. Don't worry I got it. Op's wife can't expect to marry someone with a strong culture of individualism and respect for privacy, and expect her extended family be able to impose on them whenever they want without notice.  There, all fixed.", "Him sucking it up for a week and not letting his wife's family visit is some BS and it's misogynistic I don't care what you say about my culture you're not part of it.", "I def understand what you\u2019ve explained. I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand why he\u2019s saying that he needs a month\u2019s notice to prepare. What would change about those things in a month?", "He should be able to set healthy boundaries ESP with family so this doesn\u2019t become an ongoing issue. It\u2019s his house. He works from home. They need to stay with SIL since she planned and arranged the visit and volunteered. She knew her space was 2 bedrooms when she made this decision and she needs to deal with it", "It\u2019s not his culture. Why can\u2019t he work from his own home?", "What a cynical assumption!", "That assumes that they expect everybody to love you and come celebrate you or that you want people to come knocking.   Op didn't say they would host, op didn't invite anyone...that was SIL, and now she's trying to drop the obligation to host that she volunteered for.", "NTA  Since OP's wife works, who will be doing the cooking for 7 people each day? Will SIL come over for breakfast, lunch, and dinner or will the MIL want to do it but have a million questions about where things are, why don't you have x, what is this stuff, etc? I wouldn't let them stay just because of that. OP would never get any work done.", "And he\u2019s not a part of his wife\u2019s. And she didn\u2019t invite the family either. She works full time, she won\u2019t be home while he is at home trying to work, and he\u2019s expected to entertain, feed, and clean up after strangers. He is absolutely allowed to set these boundaries. And I\u2019m OPs culture, that is completely normal and not misogynistic. I\u2019d be saying the same thing if wife was saying no, and it was the husbands family coming with VERY LITTLE notice that she didn\u2019t invite.", "That\u2019s a good question.  I know when I have houseguests I try to restock everything in the fridge and pantry, getting things they might like to make their stay more comfy, setting up the guest room and bath, deep cleaning the house, etc\u2026In OPs case I would assume they need time to mentally prepare themselves and put away things that aren\u2019t child friendly.   Maybe even to restructure their work schedules so that his wife can be home a day?  It\u2019s a lot to go from sharing a house with your partner to having 5 additional people there.  And having kids around when you\u2019re not used to it.  It\u2019s a challenge for the kids too because their in a different environment and probably jet lagged from flying all the way from Pakistan.  \n\nI have 3 kids under 10\u2026I personally would not stay at anyone\u2019s home except my parents because I know it can be a lot.  That said culturally it might be deemed as insulting to have your out of country guests stay in a hotel.  I just feel the sister should have worked this out before and discussed the arrangements.", "I get boundaries and yada yada yada, but they are coming from Pakistan, not North Jersey. It's not like this is going to happen every other weekend. So they can think he's a dick til the end of time, or he can find a way to make it work and have a serious discussion with SIL about not putting them in this position ever again.", "Well, that's on SIL, she's the one who invited and agreed to host.", "OP working from home is also a major issue here. I mostly refuse to host anyone during the week anymore except for a very few people who I know will leave me alone and let me work in peace or who will be out all day. I quit doing it after having multiple different guests in the past who knew I worked from home and still assumed I could just drop everything and stop working to cook for them, drive to the grocery store, entertain them or whatever else. I've had others that never came into my home office to bother me, but couldn't understand why they couldn't just have music or a movie blaring over the stereo while I was working. \n\nI've been at least part WFH for over a decade and it seems people still don't understand that you still have to work all day even if you're working from home. I really thought that covid might change that since so many more people experienced what WFH is like, but it mostly hasn't.", "If OP isn\u2019t Pakistani, they will probably give him a pass. I know it\u2019s a bit offensive, but by desi standards, people assume westerners won\u2019t know how to be properly hospitable because the way of life here is so individualistic. And really, what people do to host here is a fraction of what a lot of Indian/Pakistani people expect from hosts. When my parents were trying to talk up a more traditional marriage for me, one of their talking points was that my prospective in laws wouldn\u2019t expect much out of me because I was born/raised in the US and they\u2019d assume I didn\u2019t know any better if I wasn\u2019t following expectations about cooking/hosting/etc.  Shockingly, even that did not tempt me to enter into a traditional marriage :D", "Yeah, but he is part of her culture because he married her. If someone isn't open to intercultural experiences, they shouldn't marry someone from a different culture.", "But it\u2019s a can of worms that he should be able to say he doesn\u2019t want to open. SIL is manipulative and no amount of discussion will make her listen. Next time they\u2019ll come back, and it\u2019ll be for weeks or a month. This trip was never planned by OP or his wife. I\u2019d rather people think I\u2019m a dick for standing my ground than become a door mat until the end of time", "Not to mention the awkwardness when OP needs the bathroom or kitchen. He\u2019ll be expected to be hospitable, offer food, beverage, play the host. It\u2019s odd that \u201cthe family\u201d wants to punish OP and his wife for not wanting to host them. I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want to stay where I\u2019m not wanted.", "That\u2019s helpful to know! I just feel like with the situation overall, it should be okay for OP not to want to host a short notice. I know if it were my family, my mom would be really stressed trying to plan for an entire family to stay at our house for week while also working full time. People should be able to set boundaries even with family:", "*\u201cPeople should be able to set boundaries even with family\u201d*\n\nAmen."]}
