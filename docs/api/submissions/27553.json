They were staying up north with another cousin, and wanted to come down to visit my wife\u2019s mother (who is currently staying at my wife\u2019s sister\u2019s house). Both us and my wife\u2019s sister live 15 minutes apart. My wife\u2019s sister invited them over to stay at her apartment. Now a week before they are about to come, my wife\u2019s sister asked if we can host them instead, since we have a bigger house (We have a 4 bedroom vs 2 bedroom). I said no because I work from home (my wife works at the hospital) and we were not planning for this. We don\u2019t have any kids, so then it would just be me and her cousins family staying at our house on the weekdays where I will be occupied with work. My wife\u2019s sister said that they will visit her house during the day, but that they would just need a place to sleep. However, I don\u2019t know how true this would really be. I also have never met any of these people, and this would be the first time I am meeting my wife\u2019s cousin and her family. I don\u2019t know how her kid is behaved or not, nor is our house as kid friendly. I mentioned to my wife that had we known in advance (say a month prior) we could\u2019ve accommodated and mentally prepared. Now my wife\u2019s sister is calling me (through my wife via text) that I am selfish and not the \u201cgood guy\u201d. My wife defends me, but I hate that this is causing a rift between close sisters because of a last minute change of plans. My wife\u2019s birthday is this coming week, and because of this my wife\u2019s sister and her family have decided not to come over to her birthday party\u2026 which feels like blackmail IMO. I am typically reserved when it comes to inviting people to stay over for a week at our house, but I don\u2019t like the emotional gymnastics that my SIL is playing with my wife.

It\u2019s your home so if course you have final say.\nBut man you have a 4 bedroom and no kids\u2026\nSIL a two bedroom.\nA 6 years old do not need a child proof house. Just hide your Venetian 4 ft tall glass vases. And it\u2019s not a toddler screaming and tantrum, most (not all) are quiet if you give them something to do.\nYou do not know the family and this is a good way to meet them and get in good grace with the rest. Otherwise say no, it\u2019s in your rights, but then don\u2019t complain if they label you the AH in the family meetings, cause it\u2019s kinda AH move.", "NTA! I\u2019ve been there being married to someone of a different culture. Unless we extend the invitation for her family to stay, it\u2019s not happening. It was hard for them initially but they learned. \n\nHome is your sanctuary, don\u2019t disturb your peace for anyone.\n\nOAN: after seeing how they allowed their kids to behave in other family members homes\u2026It\u2019s a HELL NO!", "NTA.  You are not a hotel.  You are not the hotel staff.  Your home is not prepped for these guests.  You have a day job that you wfh.  Your wife does not seem to be taking the week off to handle them.  They are not your responsibility. Your wife and sister can rent them an Airbnb.  Your wife needs to back you up, particularly after she threw you under the bus as the person to blame.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur wife's sister is the AH - SHe invited them. Ask her why she does not like them any more, and what is the reason she is kicking them out?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand: You are right to set boundaries, and not give in to blackmail..", "Since you work from home, I\u2019m going to say NTA. I they are there for a week and your wife is not taking off to deal with them, then you will have to. \nAnd trying to work and trying to accommodate them will be total chaos for you. Otherwise I would say let them come.", "INFO: So it sounds like your wife would allow this except for your objections...?", "NTA. At this moment, your SIL is saying you have more bedrooms but they will come to my small apt every day to visit...until it's we are going to all come to your house every day cause you have a bigger house to host all the family during this visit...we are all visiting at your house and you haven't made us lunch. Why are you ignoring us while you are in your house during the day...you can work later.\n\nIt may or may not happen like this but agreeing to them staying at last minute so cause more issues. Especially since they will probably expect you and your wife to play host to them all week.", "NTA, give in now and you will be manipulated every time", "NAH - but dude, it's only a week. You can lay down some rules for them, say that it has to be very quiet during the day because you work from home and they cannot disturb you at work. You can do basic child proofing in a few hours, remove valuable breakables and put them away. Lock the cabinet with toxic cleaners, etc. Six year olds are not as troublesome when it comes to child-proofing.", "NAH. But\u2026\n\nYou married someone with a big extended family. It\u2019s one week and you keep the peace between your wife, her sister, and her family. I suggest just biting the bullet and making the best out of it.", "NTA how on earth was your wife\u2019s sister going to host 5 extra people in a 2 bedroom apartment with no guest room? I bet that the plan from the beginning was to have them stay at your house. Send them Airbnb or hotel info. That is a huge ask especially since you wfh. You could offer for your MIL to stay at your home for the week.", "NTA.  They can stay at a motel or hotel.  You are under no obligation to house or entertain people just because they are somehow related.", "That's a big ask.  Maybe you could take them the last couple days?  After you get to know them a bit and they would be up-sizing not downsizing apartments?", "NTA! Your wife\u2019s sister invited them over. Didn\u2019t she know that she has a 2 bedroom place beforehand? She could talk to you and your wife before inviting them over, discuss everything. But now it seems like she decided not to deal with her own promises and guilt tripping you.", "I support you fully. And truly, the only possible mistake I see you making is not having tremendous foresight regarding any cultural differences between yourself and your wife's family? Its your house. And you certainly don't have to allow your SIL to influence how things are managed. (***But, I bet this was her plan all along because she knows you have more room?*** She just waited to break it to you because for her and most of her family - this is to be expected as the norm?)\n\nFamily makes room for family in many subcultures, after all?\n\nAt any rate - NTA. But, trying to get a handle on these kinds of expectations for the next 30 years might not be what you saw coming? One of the benefits of living apart from the family hive is that no one is constantly trying to manipulate you with their BS? \ud83d\ude02", "YTA\nYou can't just be nice to your inlaws for a short period of time and let them stay? Incredibly selfish and a hole of you", "NTA but these are like one in a lifetime trips that I don\u2019t see happening to often and since this is the first time this has happened and you live 15mins from the sister. This would be a solid u can do for the family but I understand your comfort for a week is more important.", "INFO: Why do you need a month\u2019s notice to mentally prepare for someone to come stay at your house?

It will give them privacy, too, which may be greatly needed after their travels.\n\nPeople who think that OP can just tell them rules have never dealt with determined matriarchs.  I'm sure that grandma is in charge of the young family, and that she has definite ideas about food, bedtimes, activities, etc.  \n\nOP also hasn't said whether these people are proficient in English, which could be problematical.

This is super short notice, and it\u2019s 5 people. Including a newborn, which would be very disruptive for OP who works from home. I know my mom would\u2019ve been incredibly stressed to be asked to host 5 people for a week with no notice. You have to think of arranging meals, laundry, cleaning up after kids, etc. OP and his wife didn\u2019t invite them or arrange this trip, and the obligation shouldn\u2019t fall on them simply because they have the space. OP\u2019s SIL made the arrangements and asked them to stay with her knowing she didn\u2019t have much space, that\u2019s on her.", "I  kind of understand where OP is coming from.

Sister in law is probably wondering why mother is camping on their tiny apt already while sister is in the empty mega mansion. Probably add that to family not wanting to come over for bday.
