We are only a year apart, we are married to best friends and live close to each other. Before kids we went out a lot socially as a 4, now it\u2019s more family occasions. We both have sons age 5 , 6 months apart. They are also close and we spend Saturday mornings in the park- dads and lads playing football. I do have to travel sometimes for work and if I\u2019m not back, Joe will take both boys. \n\nJoe and SIL(Cat)work full time in well paying jobs and have a nanny. I work full time, sometimes away from home, my wife (Mim) works part time and is able to WFH. \nWe have an arrangement that their nanny will look after our son for a while before and after school and we contribute a bit. \n\nWe have been trying for a 2nd child for nearly a year and it\u2019s now putting a strain on us. Mim is doing ovulation tests-  if I\u2019m away at the optimum time it\u2019s difficult, sometimes I drive back, sometimes I really can\u2019t and we argue. When her period comes, she\u2019s very upset and I don\u2019t seem to be able to say anything to help. I think we\u2019re ok and it will happen soon, as we had 1 quite easily, but she\u2019s very stressed. I\u2019m trying to be supportive but I\u2019m tired and starting to feel like a sperm donor. \n\nAt the same time, Cat effortlessly got pregnant, which upset Mim, though she\u2019s  her friend and she was outwardly happy for her. \n\nCat went into labour recently, slightly earlier than expected. Joe wanted to be there with Cat but the nanny had a family commitment and was unable to stay later than her normal hours to look after their boy- otherwise she would have stayed late. I was working away. Joe asked Mim if she would babysit. \n\nMim said no before Joe had chance to say Cat was in labour. She could have helped practically, but thought they had to work late and was annoyed they would put work before their child. But basically, she was upset because her (late) period had come. Not sure but sounds like she cut him off before he could say real reason- and he\u2019s as stubborn as her and wouldn\u2019t beg her. \n\nJoe asked our other brother (100 miles away) and he came. It made it more stressful for Joe and Cat but ultimately it\u2019s ok for them, they now have a beautiful healthy daughter. \n\nWhen I found out, I was annoyed with Mim and told her so. It\u2019s not gone well. She was upset but Cat is her friend and she caused stress for her when in labour and potentially could have prevented Joe being at the birth but I know she\u2019s stressed by not getting pregnant again and maybe I should be doing more.", "created_utc": 1670189168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcm8fl/aita_for_being_annoyed_with_my_wife_for_not/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get being annoyed cause of the situation but one it worked out fine and two she didn\u2019t know and he didn\u2019t bother to correct her so that is in him not on her she was probably feeling devastated and depressed not just \u201cupset\u201d her period was late meaning she got her hopes up and then her hopes and dreams were shattered that day and then she gets a call about babysitting for what she believes is work not that her friend was in labor so I\u2019m sure in her current feelings she didn\u2019t want to be around children because she would most likely feel more like a failure and get more depressed and possibly even resentful towards either the children or her friend. Then when she finds out what was actually going on she probably felt guilty that she cut him off and is still most likely feeling depressed and hurt about the period and then her husband comes home and tells her he\u2019s annoyed with her for not babysitting the kids. So on top of everything else she\u2019s feeling now her husband is piling on to all of it so I understand where you were coming from but you should have kept your annoyance to yourself especially if joe and sil haven\u2019t said anything about it and they were the ones effected not you. But I don\u2019t think anyone was an asshole I think your just not understanding the depth of her emotions on infertility especially for women when we are told all our lives that kids are basically our only real value in the world and then when you can\u2019t give that to the person you love more than anything it really messes with your mind and self esteem. So I really think you should apologize. Now this is all based on the info provided and obviously I do not know your wife or her emotions this is just speculation based off what I know most women feel when having infertility issues. But I would have a conversation with your wife about everything especially because if it\u2019s effecting her mental health like I think you might need to have a conversation about taking a break from trying while you both maybe to go some therapy about your infertility issues to help you both process it because it could also be effecting you without you realizing it. I\u2019m basing that off you saying you feel like a sperm doner. Maybe instead of being more emotional you\u2019ve become more numb in a way to it. Again I don\u2019t know you this is just me giving theories.", "NAH. This is an emotionally volatile situation for everyone involved, and some kindness is in order on both sides. \n\nThat said, secondary infertility (when you conceive your first child easily but experience challenges with the second) is incredibly common. If you\u2019ve been trying for close to a year for your second, I would strongly recommend seeing a fertility specialist or reproductive endocrinologist.\n\nYour wife is also 35? Most doctors recommend seeking fertility support after six months of trying without conception at that age. It\u2019s technically considered a \u201cgeriatric\u201d pregnancy, meaning there can be additional challenges due to age. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to mansplain here, and I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m already telling you something you both know. But secondary infertility is very real, and if you both want this second child, I can\u2019t express how much I recommend talking to a doctor earlier rather than later.", "NTA, but I do think you should have been just as annoyed at your brother. Just as your wife could have heard him out, he could have taken two seconds to be like \u201cit\u2019s because my wife is in labor and the nanny\u2019s unavailable.\u201d \n\nYour wife had an emotional day and lacked the info it was an emergency. Your brother does a lot for you - definitely enough that babysitting shouldn\u2019t be an issue at all and I can see the annoyance - but he is also an adult who can communicate information. Pretty much everyone had days they\u2019re less up for doing stuff and circumstances that can override that.", "NTA", "Nanny was completely available apart from this day! \nJoe did try to call me, my phone was required to be off. \nI\u2019m  not holding a grudge against her, I love her.", "No, from what I gather she cut Joe off before he could say it. I\u2019m sure he could have interrupted her to explain but he didn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t there so don\u2019t know exactly how it went (he\u2019s not complained tbf).

It\u2019s been tough on both of of us, but more on her. Good perspective", "I don\u2019t agree with the statement that he should be doing more. I feel like people often forget that fertility issues are difficult for men too, not just women. And people on Reddit are very quick to jump and support the women in a fertility post, but not so much the men. And that\u2019s not right. \n\nFrom his post alone it\u2019s apparent that he loves and supports his wife, but he is also stressed out. Feeling like a sperm donor does not sound like a picnic, and can make you feel objectified, which is something that most women can relate to. \n\nAnd the way you stated that you feel bad for his wife because he\u2019s adding to her stress, well she seems to also be adding to his stress by arguing with him when he can\u2019t leave work to have sex because she is ovulating, or starting arguments with him when it turns out that she got her period that month. That\u2019s not okay. And he is also dealing with a lot. \n\nI think this was a poorly communicated situation and his wife seems to be taking her stress and resentment out on the brother and his wife. Unintentionally, but it\u2019s still happening. \n\nPerhaps a weekend getaway would help both of them relax and reconnect, and remember why they wanted to add a new bundle of joy to their family in the first place.", "When someone looks after your child on the regular, or has your child looked after, it is not unreasonable to return the favor.  The fact that they are family and friends should make it even more so.  If a family member or friend who routinely helps me out asks for a favor than yeah I'm obligated to help them back if it is possible.  I'm sure as shit obligated to let them finish their request before saying no.\n\nFertility issues are horrible, but her SIL didn't get pregnant out of spite.  She doesn't have free reign to take her frustration out on those around her that do nothing but help.  She said no because she's upset and taking it out on the wrong people.  Stop making excuses for shitty behavior.", "So if someone calls to asks a favor from you it is typical for you to cut them off before they can finish asking?

You guys seem really close and might not have been a thought to have specific conversations. I had a friend in a really really labour and I went over to take over for the nanny who had to go come and be there before the grandparents arrived. \nI hope your wife isn\u2019t being to hard on herself.\nI wish you both strength during your current struggle.", "I really don\u2019t want to call you an asshole because of everything your brother does for your family, but you seriously are not recognizing the mental toll this has taken on your wife.\n\nEverytime she gets her period is a slap on her face, you yourself call yourself only a sperm donor. For her she is seeing herself as a failure. You can\u2019t get annoyed at her for things cause by her mental health. She is trying her best to put a smile on for the last 9 months. She was bound to crack at some point. You are the asshole for not understanding that and communicating this to your brother prior. Everything could have been avoided if a birth plan was communicated. Your wife would have never been in that situation where you would expect her to compromise her mental health.", "She wasn\u2019t in a mood to babysit that night and thought they were just trying to stay late at work is what you said, so maybe Joe should have said \u201cHold on- Cat\u2019s in labor\u201d, but he was too frazzled to think of it at that moment. \n\nBack off your wife. \n\nShe may feel bad about it too.", "EXACTLY. She's having a hard time and that should be taken into account but so is HE!! It is a difficult situation for BOTH of them.", "Yeah, if I was feeling overwhelmed enough I absolutely might! She doesn't necessarily have to know all the details to judge whether or not she's up for doing a favor. Making assumptions isn't great, but berating her isn't right either.", "The fact that she reacted that way shows she's at her limit.", "I agree, it definitely seems like he\u2019s minimizing her very real anxiety and grief. \n\nI went through something similar. I got pregnant easily with my oldest when we started trying - within 3 months. With my second, it took us more than a year. Every negative test every month felt like a failure on my part, it was incredibly painful and I cried every time my period came. My partner had a similar attitude to OP at first, but he eventually got it one month when he gave me his usual platitudes and I just broke down.", "So to just say no without letting them finish makes you rude full stop.  If you are not up to it and cannot after they finush asking then that is one thing, but to cut them off before they finish what they are saying is another thing completely.", "So she needs to find a better way to deal with emotions rather than cutting people off dismissively.  I get that she is having a hardmtime emotionally but her reaction is self defeating and rude.  She blew off her best friend/SIL and BIL when they were in need.  I hope she needs no favors from them for a bit to let things settle out some.", ">  I get that she is having a hardmtime emotionally but her reaction is self defeating and rude.\n\nShe is not acting rationally because she's having a breakdown. How hard is that to understand?", "YTA. You are so far up your own butt you cannot see how that would hurt your wife. Smh", "NTA Your wife is projecting her issues onto her friend and BiL. While it sucks she\u2019s struggling to get pregnant, it doesn\u2019t entitle her to be nasty about it or take it out on others.", "Late periods when trying to conceive could be an early stage miscarriage which means hormones mixed with physical and emotional exhaustion might not make her a good babysitter anyways.  I was going to say N-A-H but going to say YTA for downplaying your wife\u2019s struggles and emotions.", "NTA", "I say NTA", "Nobody is an AH in this situation.", "Periods can have those effects anyway.", "YTA, massively. Her period just came and you assume she feels okay to babysit and deal with your immaturity.\n\nAdopt if you want a baby so bad.", "Brother also could have led with, \"Wife's in labor. Can you babysit?\"", "She just got her period, it's like her dream of getting another child was crushed AGAIN. \n\nIt sounds like she is/was depressed af. \n\nWhen she heard the word \"babysitting\" her only thought was probably \"hell no, there is no way I can handle that right now\". \n\nThe brother could have told her it's an emergency. But apparently him being generally stubborn is a perfect valid excuse to not clarify while the wife feeling depressed and not thinking straight isn't.", ">Ops wife cut off his brother before he could say cat was in labor how was he supposed to tell her.\n\n\nBrother: \"Hey can you babysit, it's -\"\nWife: \"No, sorry I can't/don't feel like it.\"\nBrother: \"But it's an emergency\" and/or \"My wife is in labor\" \n\nThere you go:)", "Fertility issues don\u2019t entitle someone to be an ah to others or take out your grievances on others.", "Tell that to the wife. She\u2019s the one who wants the baby bad", "Yeah I think it was silly that he didn't explain. \n\nThis is an overall shit show but they BOTH need help.", "We don\u2019t know, but- quite possibly it wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d responded to brother/SIL by being depressed & unable to handle things, and under the circumstances he didnt have time to deal with that.\n\nIt sounds like OP & especially wife could benefit from counseling, before she ends up alienating people who love her. OP might not be the only person in her life who\u2019s been affected by her stress for the past year. (It can\u2019t be good for the child they already have, either.)", "And if I beat someone up, it must be because I\u2019m at my limit?", "Tone also matters. What if she was short and said a very resound no? Then people will call BIL an AH for persisting and respecting her boundary. She said a very clear no and he took it.", "Yes but she cut him off...again. that's the point she didn't let him speak.", "Nothing entitles somebody to that. But fertility issues and grief explain the behaviour, and anyone with a heart would empathise with that.", "I agree. I've always had fertility problems & was not able to have kids. I admit it hurt, that the majority of my friends & family seemed to be able to get pregnant with very little problems. However, I never took any of my issues with it, out on someone who was pregnant, because it wasn't their fault I couldn't.", "She may have cut him off to rush off the phone or have an emotional breakdown in front of someone. We don\u2019t know or understand her state of mind - she may have been doing the best she could at that moment.", "this is crazy is it normal to treat having another baby like a job? this just sounds depressing for everyone involved", "You can empathize and still be annoyed by their behavior. Her closest friend and BiL needed her assistance for something very important and she couldn\u2019t set aside her feelings even briefly enough to have a conversation with him to find out exactly what was needed.", "What do you mean?", "Come on. You've just had a period you didn't want, which means you're not pregnant. Again. You're devastated, frustrated, angry, sad, hopeless, grieving.\n\n  Hey can you babysit?\n\n  No it's a bad time go away please.", "I agree with this. It's sad that Mim is having trouble conceiving but you have your best friends' back. It sounds like the brother is willing to take both kids to play football.  That's why you don't jump to conclusions. especially about women who are super pregnant.", "husband feels like a sperm donor and wife is heart broken every time she gets her period it just sounds like a sad way to live", "Yeah life is really sad. Fertility issues are very common and it causes a lot of heart break.", "I don\u2019t understand this sub - I\u2019ve seen a few posts similar to this where the only difference is no fertility/pregnancy issue, and the person who refuses to babysit is always the asshole. Because OP\u2019s wife just got her period and isn\u2019t pregnant, it\u2019s okay that she immediately said no to watching her BEST FRIEND\u2019S kid, without even hearing the entire situation? I understand the frustration and heartbreak with fertility issues, but that doesn\u2019t magically and entirely excuse someone from being a good friend. And OP\u2019s wife had to know her BEST FRIEND was due any day. NTA", "I mean there's only so much you can do! You both need to calm down and let mother nature do her thing. Stressing about it will not help you get pregnant any faster. Maybe you and wife need a weekend away to just relax. As for her behavior toward your brother and his wife, I definitely  think they deserve an apology from your wife.", "Nta", "YTA. And your relationship is not \u201cokay.\u201d", "Gentle YTA. I think OP, Joe and Cat should extend your wife a little grace on this one. It sounds like very unfortunate timing. She was having a moment where she did not have the mental bandwidth to cope with babysitting or talk to anyone in that moment. She didn't know there was an emergency and she was too deep grappling with grief of her own. Explain the situation to Cat and Joe and ask them to be understanding. Ultimately, no harm was done, an alternative carer was found, everyone is fine except your wife (and perhaps OP too).", "YTA, I guess, for dragging this out and remaining angry over a misunderstanding that everyone involved seems to have got over. \n\nYour wife was stressed and upset and said no to a request to randomly babysit, not a biggie. Your BIL really could have mentioned his wife was in labour at that point, but he found another option instead and everything worked out. If your other brother couldn\u2019t have come, he may have gone back to your wife and explained, and she may have agreed - we have no idea of all this. But wife isn\u2019t an AH for saying no to babysitting randomly not knowing the circumstances.", "NTA - I don\u2019t know why everyone is giving OP so much flack. Every time they don\u2019t get pregnant, he is experiencing it too. His feelings are valid. The replies are giving off the vibe of degrading and undervaluing men\u2019s emotions\u2026 \n\nOverall IMO it sucks but as a woman, period don\u2019t give you an excuse to be rude. Which cutting people off mid sentence is exactly that. And also it\u2019s a known thing that when you stress so much over getting pregnant, makes you not get pregnant. It happens to families often\u2026", "Why didn't you volunteer to babysit, OP? Being as how you're so concerned about leaving your friends in the lurch.", "Maybe OP should have volunteered to babysit, instead of letting Mim take the heat."]}
