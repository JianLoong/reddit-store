It\u2019s not someone else\u2019s job to fix her mistakes", "NTA. She asked if she could borrow it. You said no. She stole it, broke it, and now doesn\u2019t think she should have to pay for it. The compromises that you offered her are generous but unnecessary. \n\nThe rest is background noise. It doesn\u2019t matter if you could afford to replace it yourself or how old she is or how much sleep she gets. She shouldn\u2019t have been using it in the first place.", "NTA\n\n> she \u201cfeels bad enough\u201d\n\nHer feelings are not compensation.", "NTA\n\nEven without the whole car situation/non-easy financial situation you are in... Your sister went behind your back to get your tablet, and her kid broke it. That makes it twice her responsibility to repair/reimburse it. The fact she is \"feeling bad enough\" doesn't take away her responsibilities.", "NTA. Your sister sounds a little entitled. There\u2019s a saying in my native language that says something along the lines of \u201cyou can\u2019t pluck feathers from a bald chicken\u201d, so I would suggest trying to overcome this on your own.", "NTA. A red flag I see is that your sister as an adult woman flees the crime scene and lets the mother explain her mistake. Yes, she is young but the attitude that cone cverants do not affect her and that she herself does not have to apologize is unacceptable.  \nShe stole your property. She let her child ruin your property. She must take her adult responsibility; Apologize and buy the exact tablet model that her child destroyed. \n\nYour sister's attitude is that her mistake is your problem, and of course if she crashes your car (which she stole btw) then you have to pay the damage.\n\nRecommend to take insurance on everything of value, or lock it in a safe/room if she ever greets you.", "Nta. She broke it. She pays for it. You were more than generous to offer to cover 1/3. She doesn\u2019t get to use teenager as an excuse. You said no. She stole it and broke it in the process of theft.", "NTA - your sister broke hardware that does not belong to you, and which now needs to be replaced.  I saw your comment that they will take the cost of it out of your paycheck, so she needs to reimburse you.  \n\nYou are being very generous by agreeing to pay for 1/3 of it yourself, but your sister needs to understand there are consequences to actions.  And we all know she knows that she's wrong here - that's why she ran up the stairs and tried to hide.  She is the ONLY one to blame for the fact that she's a single teen mom, that excuse for weaseling out of stuff is ridiculous.  She needs to pay for this.", "NTA \"feels bad enough\" is not worth anything. And its not like you are asking her for the full amount even though you had every right to. Her being a single teen mom is her own choice which whilst sad does not factor into her stealing your stuff. If you had let her use the tablet and if the tablet was not the universities property then I can understand her not wanting to pay. Like I dont expect anything I lend to my friends with babies to come back in tip top condition so I dont lend them anything super expensive because even if it breaks I dont mind and would not expect the them to pay. But she and lets not forget this STOLE it from you after you said no it was not even yours which crosses the pity line and puts her entirely in the wrong. You can tell her to go tell the university that \"she feels bad enough\" and see if they wont want the money back still (to be honest its like 50/50 depending on how understanding your admins are but hopefully they dont let her off because she should learn a lesson).", "NTA she should at least pay for some it person to check it out, and go from there.", "NTA. Your sister stole from you and broke your property. Stand up for yourself.", "Your sister is a mom and STILL can't understand the word no? Jesus your mom failed her by coddling her too much. It's time she took responsibility like a real mom should.", "Your sister needs to learn her lesson and it back. It\u2019s the only way.\n\nNTA.", "NYA. She used it without permission, and her kid wrecked it. She has a job - this is where she gets to learn about payment plans!", "NTA. You likely signed some sort of IT acceptable use document/contract to participate in this research, that likely includes a clause about responsible use of academic property. Thus, you accepted responsibility for this equipment. This means telling non-authorized users they cannot use the tablet, which you reasonably did when you told her \"no\" - which is a complete sentence. Your sister decided she knew better and now this property is damaged. Even if her child got his hands on it, she could have taken it from him and returned it to your room. The university will hold you responsible though you're not at fault. It's only reasonable to hold your sister accountable for 100% of the incurred cost.", "Sue", "If you don\u2019t go after her in small claims, the school will go after you.\n\nTime to make a choice.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  What tour sister did (using a piece of your equipment after being told no) is the kind of thing that could potentially get you fired from a job.  Many people in corporate jobs have a laptop or iPhone that they are not allowed to let a friend or family member use, as there can be secret or confidential information exposed. \n\nYour sister needs to grow up and act like an adult. And your mom needs to stop coddling her. \n\nAlso, you shouldn\u2019t have offered to pay for 1/3 of the cost - you did nothing wrong.", "NTA and she needs to pay for the full amount. Do not let this go. She can sell some of her stuff and pay for it.", "NTA and imo, you should have not let her off the hook for that 1/3. She's old enough to know what the word \"no\" means. You shouldn't have to lock your shit up from people who are older than 6 or 7. She *is* a single teen mom - meaning that, as a mom, she is responsible for her child. No \"but he's just a baby\" bullshit. Parents are responsible for the actions of their young children, and for keeping them from doing dumb things. It's not your fault that she had a kid so young and then couldn't be bothered to watch him. It's definitely not your fault that she can't understand what \"no\" means. Why should you be the one to eat the costs?", "NTA - she broke it she can pay for it.", "NTA. She used and broke something that didn't even belong to you. No you should not let it go. Get the money for the tablet (go to small claims court if necessary) and get the whole amount.\n\nIt doesn't matter how she is \"feeling\" the tablet needs to be replaced. There will be a lot of these kinds of lessons coming if she doesn't learn now.", "NTA. She should pay to replace it", "NTA\u2026she needs to learn not to touch other peoples things.

Your sister is completely in the wrong and should have known better. You don\u2019t steal people\u2019s stuff and you certainly don\u2019t steal stuff you can\u2019t afford to replace.

Hell, maybe the threat of going to court would get her to pay for it.\n\nAlthough you are a bit of an AH to yourself for not pursuing compensation from Uber or Lyft for the kid peeing in your car. From what I know, you have to report it right away and take pictures, so it\u2019s probably too late. But you should still look into it and see if you can get them to pay for it. \n\nJust remember for the future that you don\u2019t have to swallow expenses like that when you\u2019re doing stuff for an employer. Essentially, if something happens while working that will cost money to fix, the first thing you should do is look it up to see if your employer is responsible for the expense. This includes if you\u2019re hired as an independent contractor. It\u2019s more limited but you still have rights, and you should know them because employers will lie to your face to get you to give up.\n\nThere\u2019s all sorts of precedent for employers having to pay for an accident their employee got into while performing work duties in their private car, for instance. So if you get into an accident while driving a passenger, that doesn\u2019t go on your personal insurance, it\u2019s on Lyft\u2019s or Uber\u2019s.
