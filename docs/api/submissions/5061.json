All the neighbours here are really friendly and we all know each other. \n\nI was out the front of my house taking the bin bags out 2 days ago and when I opened my bin, I didn\u2019t know why or how, but my neighbour\u2019s (f19) cat Violet was in my bin. The lid was shut, and she started meowing like crazy. The poor thing was absolutely terrified. I tried reaching in but at first I couldn\u2019t reach, so I got my step ladder from inside.\n\nEvery time I touched her, she tried to attack me. I gave up when she scratched my hand and it hurt. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, but I didn\u2019t want to put my rubbish on top of the cat obviously, so i just closed the lid again and put the bin bags next to it.\n\nI hadn\u2019t heard anything from my neighbour so I assumed she found Violet in there as she wouldn\u2019t stop meowing. Today at around 9:15am I got a really loud knock at my door. When I opened it my neighbour actually had tears streaming down her face. \n\nShe went on to say that she\u2019d come back from being at her friend\u2019s house, and she was looking everywhere for her cat. She heard the meowing and found her cat in the bin still terrified and hungry. I didn\u2019t notice it had still been there. \n\nBecause the lid was shut, she checked her camera\u2019s outside (there\u2019s a view of my house) and claimed some horrible person had walked past and lifted the cat into the bin and shut the lid, and when I found her she\u2019d been in there for 1 hour. She saw me close the lid again, and she\u2019s absolutely devastated.\n\nI never meant for this to happen, I like cats and wouldn\u2019t want to hurt one. I said sorry but she just walked away. AITA??\n\nEdit: Because the bin is tall that not even I could reach, if I left the lid open it probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to jump out.", "created_utc": 1671399423, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp94bn/aita_for_leaving_my_neighbours_cat_in_the_bin/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I tried to get her out but she seems scared and scratched me, so I wanted to make sure you knew. Sorry to send this in a text but I wanted to make sure you knew as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThat took me about a minute to type.\n\nYes OP, YTA", "YTA - The bin was empty, right? If it\u2019s the type of standard trash bin I\u2019m imagining, why didn\u2019t you just tilt it on it\u2019s side so the cat could scurry out? At least leave the lid open? *Alert your neighbor*?\n\nI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t mean to cause the cat harm greater harm, but there were other options you could have and should have taken. Leaving the cat in the bin, and especially closing the lid, was not the brightest move. You do owe your neighbor an apology, your head wasn\u2019t all there at the time.", "YTA - so you just shut the lid on the cat and made no attempt to contact your neighbor?! Wtf?", "YTA.  You left a living being in a trash bin she couldn't get out of.\n\nWas there no way to tip the bin over to let the cat? Or find a tall item to put into the bin to allow the cat to crawl/climb out?  Maybe you could have contacted your neighbor to let her know rather than leaving the cat for someone else to hopefully find.", "YTA. Why in the world didn't you knock on your neighbors door or leave a note for them? Or tip the bin gently over and hold the lid open? Or call a friend for advice?", "YTA. If that cat had somehow died, it would have been your fault.", "YTA, and I fail to see how would you think you are not.", "YTA firmly.\n\nYou *closed the lid* and didn't alert your neighbor.  On what planet are you *not* the AH, Melmac?", "YTA. You could have at least told them. If you mean bin as in trash can, then you could've tipped it over. You also need to apologize for knowing about it and not doing anything.", "YTA. There\u2019s a few actions that could\u2019ve been made.\n\n-Contact your neighbor their cat is stuck in your bin. \n-Ask *anyone* for help. \n-Tilt the bin and leave it open. \n-Move the bin to avoid the garbage truck. \n\nYou sound unaccountable. You failed to act and don\u2019t see how that could upset someone. That cat was *trapped* and you stopped trying after plan A failed.", "YTA\n\nScared cats scratch, that's not a reason to trap them. Grab her with a towel, lay the bin on its side, go get your neighbour, call your council/animal control, call the local vet...anything but just leaving her trapped in there.\n\nJesus Christ.", "YTA. You know you could have just tipped the bin over, or asked for help, or called animal control? Ugh.", "YTA.  Biggest one I\u2019ve seen in awhile.", "YTA. You found your neighbour's trapped pet, and it didn't occur to you to tell your neighbour? Or tip the bin over to let Violet out? Or anything that wasn't close the lid on the poor cat and leave it there for two days? Because of you, that poor animal was trapped, hungry, and frightened. For two days. What did you think was going to happen to the cat? Were you hoping bin day would arrive and the bin men would solve the 'problem' for you by unknowingly throwing poor Violet in to be crushed? Because that's what you nearly caused.\n\nSomehow I don't think your neighbours are going to be friendly to you anymore. In fact, I think you should probably move, because if I was the neighbour whose cat you did this to, I'd be putting the video online and making sure everyone in the street saw it.", "You closed the lid, guaranteeing the cat would be incapable of escaping on its own.  YTA.", "WTF??? I hope this isn't real, but yes. YTA.", "Why wouldn\u2019t you at least try to contact your neighbor about it? YTA", "YTA. Couldn't you have told your neighbor about this?

It didn\u2019t occur to you to get in contact with your neighbor?", "YTA\n\nDude, so you, in your rational mind, thought the cat was supposed to be in the bin? Was it on time out?\n\nIt was clearly in distress and needed human intervention or a quick death. You should have stepped in or at least called for help if you were too cowardly to take a scratch or two.", "You are clearly the asshole in the situation. You could've gently laid the bin on its side and let the cat run out or call your neighbour to tell them where their cat was or at the very fucking least not put the fucking lid back on making it impossible for the cat to get out or breathe.", "YTA for walking away and assuming that they neighbor would find the cat rather than knocking and telling them. \n\n(Pro tip, if you are trying to pick up an unhappy cat, wrapping your arms in a towel reduces the bloodshed.)", "Yes\nYTA", "YTA. You should have alert your neighbor or at the very least leave the lid open so the cat could escape.", "YTA. Is the bin too big to tilt on its side so the cat can escape? If so, you couldn't simply leave the lid up so it try to climb out?", "Are you serious?! Yes YTA! You could have gotten gloves, left the lid open, asked your neighbors for help, let your neighbors know what was going on, tried leaving the ladder leading out so the cat could climb it, but instead you shut the lid and left it there. What is wrong with you?", "What the actual fuck did I just read. Of course YTA for keeping an animal trapped!!!!!! Jfc dude.", "I dont get it? \n\nWas the bin to big to tip over so the cat could run out?\n\nor as others have said leave the lid open maybe put a box in so the cat has something to jump  on then jump out?\n\nyou made an effort then gave up. what if that was you terrified and stuck how would you feel?\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nThere were so many things you could have done to help this poor kitty, who was terrified and traumatized by being stuck in the bin. You could have tipped it over, called animal control, hell even putting a branch in there for it to climb out on its own would have been something. Putting the lid back on and just leaving it there was the wrong thing to do.", "YTA why would you not tell your neighbor her cat was stuck in the trash can???", "YTA. Lean the bin on its side so she can walk out. Leave a ladder in there so she can climb out. Go knock on your neighbors door. There are so many other options besides closing the bin on a terrified cat.", "YTA.  Why didn't you contact your neighbour?  Or put the bin on its side?  Or get someone else to help?  Or call animal rescue?  You had options and you chose to simply leave the poor soul in a bin.", "YTA, leave the lid up, tip the bin over, etc, you had options.", "YTA. \n\nWTF? This has to be fake because that has to be the worst problem solving/reasoning skills I've ever seen.", "Are you for real right now? Like you really want an answer? The fact that you let a cat in a trash can for who knows how long isn't enough? YTA", "YTA, why didn't you tip the bin to the side so the cat could get out without you touching it??? Why did you shut the lid? Why didn't you try to let your neighbor know her cat was in your bin?", "Yes YTA. Should have left the top up, turned it on its side.. asked for help. That was a complete careless move on your behalf tbh", "INFO - When you first saw the cat in the bin did you know who it belonged to and where that person lived?", "YTA.\n\nI get not knowing how to get a frightened cat out of the bin. That\u2019s not what made you the AH. The AH part came from the fact that *you willingly, and knowingly, closed the lid of the bin despite knowing the cat was there*. Did you expect the cat would make its way out magically? \n\nWas tipping the bin on its side not an option? The cat would\u2019ve eventually made its way out of the bin had the bin been left on its side. You should\u2019ve also notified your neighbour about what you found at the earliest instance; being a good neighbour means looking out for each other. Don\u2019t just assume your neighbours will figure out where the cat is. Alternatively, you could\u2019ve called your local animal shelter or animal control and seek advice on freeing the cat. You could\u2019ve offered the cat a towel for it to claw onto and once the cat was attached to the towel, gently lift it out. Lastly, leaving the lid open would\u2019ve been infinitely better than shutting the lid again; the cat may have been able to jump out, depending on the size of the cat and the height of the bin.\n\nYou weren\u2019t the one to put it in the bin, no. But you were the one that came across the distressed cat, failed in your one attempt to free the cat, and decided that keeping the cat trapped in the bin was the better course of action.\n\nAs a cat owner, I would\u2019ve been absolutely livid had this happen to my cat.", "YTA - you should have contacted the neighbour immediately, if they were unavailable call animal control to help.", "Big YTA. There is something seriously wrong with you.", "You seriously couldn't try to get in contact with your neighbor? Or keep the lid open? Or gently place the bin down and open it so the cat could get out?? YTA", "YTA. How cruel and inhuman do you have to be to not try and contact your neighbor?\n\nAnd when/if not reaching her then call the animal emergency line. Or ASPCA or whatever the equivalent is where you dwell. \n\nAsshole is definitely the kindest word that I\u2019m thinking right now.", "YTA I know that this first bit is unpopular but I loathe 99% of cats. I would NEVER have done this. Ever. \n\nI would have tried to tip the bin down. If I couldn\u2019t do that I would have left the lid open and made every effort to contact the neighbour. Like ringing, phoning, knocking on windows. Since you know the name of the cat, you also knew exactly where to ring the bell. A child would have had more sense than you.", "Is this a serious question?! Of course YTA, you could have tipped the bin on its side, you could have not closed the lid, you could have tried to contact your neighbour, but no you walked away and did nothing.", "Why in the actual fuck would you close the lid after finding the cat in there? What is wrong with you? YTA and have absolutely no care in the fucking world for other living creatures. Holy shit dude.", "YTA\u2026 A. Why didn\u2019t you tell her? B. Why not just push the bin over or tilt it so the cat falls out? And finally C. Why in gods name did you close the bin lid again?!", "YTA.\n\nCome the fuck on. How can you be so dense? If I were you, I would honestly consider getting a mental evaluation because normal people wouldn't just walk away and go about their day after finding a cat trapped in a garbage can.\n\nGet help and fuck you.", "YTA. I curse you and your next 5 generations for intentional cruelty to an animal.", "YTA for not telling your neighbor.  Did it ever occur to you they didn't know where their pet was?

Put the trash in the bin and the cat will climb it to get out. Just leave the bin open and the cat will jump out. Cats can jump really fuckin high.

If you couldn\u2019t take the cat out why close the f*cking lid, wtf is wrong with you? Why didn\u2019t you go tell your neighbour?

All the neighbours here are really friendly and we all know each other. \n\nI was out the front of my house taking the bin bags out 2 days ago and when I opened my bin, I didn\u2019t know why or how, but my neighbour\u2019s (f19) cat Violet was in my bin. The lid was shut, and she started meowing like crazy. The poor thing was absolutely terrified. I tried reaching in but at first I couldn\u2019t reach, so I got my step ladder from inside.\n\nEvery time I touched her, she tried to attack me. I gave up when she scratched my hand and it hurt. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, but I didn\u2019t want to put my rubbish on top of the cat obviously, so i just closed the lid again and put the bin bags next to it.\n\nI hadn\u2019t heard anything from my neighbour so I assumed she found Violet in there as she wouldn\u2019t stop meowing. Today at around 9:15am I got a really loud knock at my door. When I opened it my neighbour actually had tears streaming down her face. \n\nShe went on to say that she\u2019d come back from being at her friend\u2019s house, and she was looking everywhere for her cat. She heard the meowing and found her cat in the bin still terrified and hungry. I didn\u2019t notice it had still been there. \n\nBecause the lid was shut, she checked her camera\u2019s outside (there\u2019s a view of my house) and claimed some horrible person had walked past and lifted the cat into the bin and shut the lid, and when I found her she\u2019d been in there for 1 hour. She saw me close the lid again, and she\u2019s absolutely devastated.\n\nI never meant for this to happen, I like cats and wouldn\u2019t want to hurt one. I said sorry but she just walked away. AITA??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
