Forced my parents to change their holiday plans to accommodate our xmas present to them", "selftext": "Please don't post this anywhere.\n\nMy mum and step-dad got married earlier this year. It was a big affair and was in a place very special to them.\n\nFor xmas, my sisters and I all decided to chip in and get them a one night stay at that place on their anniversary. They'll be staying in the same bridal suite they did before, they'll have a bottle of champagne in their room, and our grandparents are getting them a lovely dinner in the restaurant there. We also thought they'd like to wander about the place they got married exactly one year prior and visit the on-site church they said their vows in.\n\nWe were convinced our parents wouldn't have made any solid plans for their anniversary so close to xmas and they hadn't mentioned anything to us so we didn't get the refundable option as it was an extra \u00a350 that we just couldn't afford.\n\nAfter booking, we found out we were all inheriting a decent portion of money. It isn't a lot, but it's enough to go on a fancy, 2-week trip abroad. And that's exactly what they decided to do. They told us last week they're spending their anniversary in the same place they spent their honeymoon in.\n\nWe asked if they'd booked it yet, which they said they hadn't, they'd only booked the holidays off work. We tried to explain that we've already booked them something non-refundable for their anniversary and could they change their dates? My mum considered it but my step-dad can be quite a stubborn man and he absolutely refused to change the dates. My mum was very torn but stuck with my step-dad and said they wouldn't change them.\n\nWe got quite frustrated and I ended up messaging my mum telling her they've basically ruined their xmas present if they don't change their dates, that they've dropped this on us 2 weeks before xmas and we dont have the time or money to find a new present for them and we're going to lose out on a lot of money because it's non-refundable. She never replied to this message.\n\nI touched base with my sister yesterday to see how things are going. She told me they've changed their holiday dates but it's not good. Apparently, they'd basically done everything but book their holiday. They'd had meetings with a travel agent, got a whole package sorted and discounts applied, they had planned it completely without mentioning it to any of us. They then tried to change the dates twice, but each time they changed them they found out someone else already had those dates off work (idk why they didn't check before deciding). They've settled on new dates now but lost out on certain aspects of the holiday because of this and my step-dad especially is acting very unhappy about the whole thing. My sister now thinks we pushed them too far and they are not going to enjoy our gift.\n\nSo, Are we the arsehole for forcing my parents to change their holiday plans because we already bought them a xmas present that happens on the same day?", "created_utc": 1671183710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znawj6/aita_forced_my_parents_to_change_their_holiday/", "score": 594, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can\u2019t gift someone a trip as a surprise unless that someone is your own minor child that lives with you.", "YTA. I've had something similar happen to me actually, when someone booked something for me and my husband without checking we were free. Our wedding was cancelled due to covid, so on the day it was supposed to have been me and my now-husband made romantic plans that were meaningful to us, including lunch at the place we had celebrated our engagement. Unbeknownst to me, my best friends planned a really thoughtful gift for us, that required my husband to drive somewhere quite out of the way in the morning to pick it up (he had to get it that day as it was an edible type thing that you collect the day it is made). This was all arranged behind my back and my husband was only told the night before as he was needed for the pick up (my friends live in another country). \n\nThe morning of our non-wedding day I was trying to start our plans and husband kept delaying them. He wanted to drive to do some random chore. I got really annoyed as we had agreed how to spend the day and it made no sense for him to disappear for 2 hours. Eventually he just told me what was going on and tbh I was more annoyed than grateful. The gift was thoughtful and definitely something I would have liked. But monopolising a day without asking me wasn't a fun surprise it was just really annoying. We had to completely reschedule our plans. We enjoyed the gift, but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd been told about it in advance and didn't end up losing lunch reservations to be able to go and get it. I could have suggested it was done on another day.\n\nYou've done the same thing to your mum but on a much much larger scale. They already had their own idea of how they would spend their anniversary that was meaningful to them. You have imposed your idea of how they should spend the day on them. Just because it is thoughtful doesn't mean it isn't a bit selfish to assume that you can monopolise someone else's event without their knowledge.", "Yta this is why you don't book something without the people knowing.

It's a very expensive time for them and they don't have a lot of money to spare.

That's the part where you've been really unfair, and kinda missing the whole spirit of a gift.", ">there was really no way of knowing or even expecting this was going to happen\n\nThat's the point, though. You never know what may come up so booking something like this without vetting it ahead with them *and* making it non-refundable was a bad idea. Some surprise presents work well, but presents which require the giftee to adhere to an agenda of your choosing is a terrible idea. And you say \"sisters\" meaning at least 3 of you and you could afford the vacation but couldn't afford the extra 50 split 3 ways? You honestly couldn't really afford the vacation. So yeah, now you've put a lot of pressure unfairly on them *and* you're telling them that they have \"ruined\" a gift that laid expectations on them that they were never advised of, nevermind agreed to.

If you'd dealt with your understandable disappointment and put the blame where it was due (the poor planning of you and sis), then you wouldn't be an ass.  But guilt tripping and acting like they are ingrates because you messed up is awful. Whether they use your gift or not, you've already ruined the experience. \n\nIt would have been better to explain the situation to mom and let them give the hotel room away (maybe to you and sis).

General rule of thumb that\u2019s good to follow is if you\u2019re gifting something that will take up a specific time frame for people, tell them first. There\u2019s no need to wait until Christmas morning, they know it\u2019s not from Santa, and they would appreciate the gift more being able to plan ahead.", "Apparently you don't or you would have already apologized to your mom and you'd stop f****** complaining on here.

Just because they didn\u2019t share their plans with the entire family, doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t have plans.   Way to go with the guilting on top of an already uncomfortable mess, which YOU created.  Happy Anniversary, Mom.", "YTA. \n\nAgain, even after you found out about the trip, you didn\u2019t bother to ask how feasible it was for them to move the dates? Even the most basic follow up questions would have revealed how much effort had gone in and that it wasn\u2019t just a simple date shuffle. \n\nI also hate that you caused an unnecessary conflict between your step-dad and mom. \n\nYou owe them both an apology. \n\nHopefully, lesson learned. And damn, don\u2019t book dates without finding the extra \u00a350 to possibly save you a massive amount of money in the future. \n\nAn alternative would have been to make a homemade gift certificate with the commitment to cover expenses for the date of their choice.", "You hijacked their first anniversary together. I don't understand the thinking, deciding for them what they would like to do on their anniversary...and presenting it as a Christmas present?

So quite common for couples to throw parties for 25th, 40th, 50th and if fortunate enough to hit 60th that was for the kids, grandkids and great grandkids to ask what they wanted and do all the legwork so the couple were just able to enjoy.\n\n1st is a personal milestone. In my super conservative family it was just unspoken that someone had the date down if a babysitter was needed, otherwise go on your good self and please tell us nothing except the info about the restaurant. (1980s conflict era Northern Ireland eating out was up there with a wedding for big events. We were so bored and war torn people visited in genuine awe when my parents got a power shower. Imagine the excitement if you ate out in a place with real tablecloths? Way more interesting than the white dress.)\n\nOtherwise we knew our parents\u2019 anniversary date and when little we made them a card each and then they usually went out and we had a babysitter. Or we had a sleepover and they stayed home.\n\nThus I as a small child in a repressed AF country with parents who showed zero affection for 25 years had gleaned by maybe age 6 that anniversaries are private couple time unless clearly stated. Thus all my anniversary plans are \u2018stay in and have sex\u2019 and I find it off when people are \u2018are you inviting friends?\u2019 And I\u2019m in a polyam relationship :)\n\nWho organises their child or their parents\u2019 romantic mini break or hosts a family dinner unprompted for anniversaries? Do they know they are more prudish than 1980s Irish nuns? It absolutely blows my mind. It\u2019s as intriguing to me as people who have a pet lion.

Adults have complicated lives, and they can't always rearrange things without some advanced warning.
