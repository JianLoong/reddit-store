Forced my parents to change their holiday plans to accommodate our xmas present to them", "selftext": "Please don't post this anywhere.\n\nMy mum and step-dad got married earlier this year. It was a big affair and was in a place very special to them.\n\nFor xmas, my sisters and I all decided to chip in and get them a one night stay at that place on their anniversary. They'll be staying in the same bridal suite they did before, they'll have a bottle of champagne in their room, and our grandparents are getting them a lovely dinner in the restaurant there. We also thought they'd like to wander about the place they got married exactly one year prior and visit the on-site church they said their vows in.\n\nWe were convinced our parents wouldn't have made any solid plans for their anniversary so close to xmas and they hadn't mentioned anything to us so we didn't get the refundable option as it was an extra \u00a350 that we just couldn't afford.\n\nAfter booking, we found out we were all inheriting a decent portion of money. It isn't a lot, but it's enough to go on a fancy, 2-week trip abroad. And that's exactly what they decided to do. They told us last week they're spending their anniversary in the same place they spent their honeymoon in.\n\nWe asked if they'd booked it yet, which they said they hadn't, they'd only booked the holidays off work. We tried to explain that we've already booked them something non-refundable for their anniversary and could they change their dates? My mum considered it but my step-dad can be quite a stubborn man and he absolutely refused to change the dates. My mum was very torn but stuck with my step-dad and said they wouldn't change them.\n\nWe got quite frustrated and I ended up messaging my mum telling her they've basically ruined their xmas present if they don't change their dates, that they've dropped this on us 2 weeks before xmas and we dont have the time or money to find a new present for them and we're going to lose out on a lot of money because it's non-refundable. She never replied to this message.\n\nI touched base with my sister yesterday to see how things are going. She told me they've changed their holiday dates but it's not good. Apparently, they'd basically done everything but book their holiday. They'd had meetings with a travel agent, got a whole package sorted and discounts applied, they had planned it completely without mentioning it to any of us. They then tried to change the dates twice, but each time they changed them they found out someone else already had those dates off work (idk why they didn't check before deciding). They've settled on new dates now but lost out on certain aspects of the holiday because of this and my step-dad especially is acting very unhappy about the whole thing. My sister now thinks we pushed them too far and they are not going to enjoy our gift.\n\nSo, Are we the arsehole for forcing my parents to change their holiday plans because we already bought them a xmas present that happens on the same day?", "created_utc": 1671183710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znawj6/aita_forced_my_parents_to_change_their_holiday/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can\u2019t gift someone a trip as a surprise unless that someone is your own minor child that lives with you.", "YTA. I've had something similar happen to me actually, when someone booked something for me and my husband without checking we were free. Our wedding was cancelled due to covid, so on the day it was supposed to have been me and my now-husband made romantic plans that were meaningful to us, including lunch at the place we had celebrated our engagement. Unbeknownst to me, my best friends planned a really thoughtful gift for us, that required my husband to drive somewhere quite out of the way in the morning to pick it up (he had to get it that day as it was an edible type thing that you collect the day it is made). This was all arranged behind my back and my husband was only told the night before as he was needed for the pick up (my friends live in another country). \n\nThe morning of our non-wedding day I was trying to start our plans and husband kept delaying them. He wanted to drive to do some random chore. I got really annoyed as we had agreed how to spend the day and it made no sense for him to disappear for 2 hours. Eventually he just told me what was going on and tbh I was more annoyed than grateful. The gift was thoughtful and definitely something I would have liked. But monopolising a day without asking me wasn't a fun surprise it was just really annoying. We had to completely reschedule our plans. We enjoyed the gift, but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd been told about it in advance and didn't end up losing lunch reservations to be able to go and get it. I could have suggested it was done on another day.\n\nYou've done the same thing to your mum but on a much much larger scale. They already had their own idea of how they would spend their anniversary that was meaningful to them. You have imposed your idea of how they should spend the day on them. Just because it is thoughtful doesn't mean it isn't a bit selfish to assume that you can monopolise someone else's event without their knowledge.", "Yta this is why you don't book something without the people knowing.

Of course you didn't want all that money to be wasted and result in them not getting a gift from you. Having to change their plans sound like an inconvenience, not an insurmountable feat.", "Everyone Sucks Here. You made plans without asking if it was convenient, they are angry about your gift.\n\nNext time ask about other olans before you book someone else a surprise", "We were trying to keep it a surprise before christmas, if we told them to clear their schedule they'd know what we were planning, we're not very subtle people tbh", "That's fair, we just really didn't expect them to book anything so close to christmas. It's a very expensive time for them and they don't have a lot of money to spare.

Character limit forced me to remove certain bits though.", "There are things that can be a surprise, and others that need to be planned with the interested parties.  \n\nFor example, you can't gift a puppy without saying anything to the recipient, \"because it's a surprise\".  \n\nSimilarly, it's bad planning to schedule commitments in someone else's name without knowing if they are available.", "That\u2019s just the thing about surprises.

You don\u2019t just spring a gift like this on someone unless you are very sure it works for them AND are 100% ok if it doesn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t give them gift, you gave them an obligation and now are being rather self centered and unreasonably upset that your plan didn\u2019t get the reaction you wanted.", "Its very easy to maintain the surprise.

The fact is that you didn't check and you're acting like *they* did something wrong when they didn't. That's the part where you've been really unfair, and kinda missing the whole spirit of a gift.", ">there was really no way of knowing or even expecting this was going to happen\n\nThat's the point, though. You never know what may come up so booking something like this without vetting it ahead with them *and* making it non-refundable was a bad idea. Some surprise presents work well, but presents which require the giftee to adhere to an agenda of your choosing is a terrible idea. And you say \"sisters\" meaning at least 3 of you and you could afford the vacation but couldn't afford the extra 50 split 3 ways? You honestly couldn't really afford the vacation. So yeah, now you've put a lot of pressure unfairly on them *and* you're telling them that they have \"ruined\" a gift that laid expectations on them that they were never advised of, nevermind agreed to. But they didn't. You & sisters did. Not with the gift but by treating them so poorly when your gift went wrong.", "Your expectations are not binding upon others. Adults communicate.", "You had good intentions but it was a huge mistake on your part to book a non refundable outing without getting their advance ok. It really doesn't matter whether traveling would usually have been out of budget. They may have had other local obligations. \n\nMistakes happen. If you'd dealt with your understandable disappointment and put the blame where it was due (the poor planning of you and sis), then you wouldn't be an ass.  But guilt tripping and acting like they are ingrates because you messed up is awful. Whether they use your gift or not, you've already ruined the experience. \n\nIt would have been better to explain the situation to mom and let them give the hotel room away (maybe to you and sis). At least then they could have appreciated the gesture - it's no big deal if you didn't get a replacement gift in that case.", "And you were super super wrong. Lesson learned.

In future just ask.", "Right, I understand that they\u2019re booking two weeks, but it could have just as easily been them booking a night somewhere for their anniversary on the same night that you did, which would still ruin your plans. They easily could have decided that themselves and booked it while your sister was out of the house. General rule of thumb that\u2019s good to follow is if you\u2019re gifting something that will take up a specific time frame for people, tell them first. There\u2019s no need to wait until Christmas morning, they know it\u2019s not from Santa, and they would appreciate the gift more being able to plan ahead.", "Apparently you don't or you would have already apologized to your mom and you'd stop f****** complaining on here.
