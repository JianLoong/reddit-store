It\u2019s hard to get through to a teenager and it sounds like you managed to do it.", "NTA but I will say it may have been something to at least mention to your wife before doing it. I feel like this is incredibly effective however and kudos for you for taking the effort to teach your son in this way.", "NTA, good job. You know what's at stake because you lived it and you help those still living it.

It\u2019s pretty much the norm for that age so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. I do agree that 15 is too young, especially for the pot because his brain is still developing and it does make you lazy and apathetic and that\u2019s not the age you want to be feeling that way for. I would try to explain that part to him and try not to do the typical \u201cscared straight\u201d route. Kids smoke pot, they just do, but if you can have a respectful conversation on his level on the negatives of abusing it at a young age while understanding where he\u2019s coming from I think it will get through to him more.", "NAH, but this was a stupid way to teach the kid.\n\nYou basically DARE'd him. Telling somebody that weed is addictive and a gateway to hard drug use, even implicitly, is so obviously bullshit that you've made any actually good anti-drug messages you give seem equally stupid.", "NTA, it will probably do more good than any talk will.  You were with him, and you know the people and the area.  It's best to use what you know from experience to try and get him on the right track before he starts experimenting with harder things.", "NTA\n\nLet him see what happens with drug and alcohol use and abuse.

You need to be careful not to create a self fulfilling prophecy from something that might be a one and only thing.", "NTA. This is a case of \"Better to ask forgiveness than permission.\"", "YTA. Not only was that extreme, you should know from experience that addicts are unpredictable and that can sometimes lead to a dangerous situation.", "YTA. \nThis was not the way to go about it. \nAlso weed is not the gateway drug people think it is. Sure it isn't 100% harmless, but most people do not smoke a joint in their teens and end up shooting up heroin by the time they graduate. \n\nI'm exaggerating here, but this was reckless parenting. You could have sat your son down and had a calm conversation about the consequences the weed and indeed other drugs can have. This includes alcohol. \n\nChances are your son is going to make even more sure he hides the weed from his parents. \n\nPersonally, if I were a parent, I'd feel much better knowing my son smoked under my roof and know that if something went wrong, he'd feel safe rather than not having any idea.\n\nIt also sounds like your projecting your experiences onto your son and that isn't fair. You might want to consider therapy for yourself.", "YTA\u2026 not for taking him out, because I don\u2019t think he was at much risk with you, but for overstating the risks. Most teens start experimenting with weed and booze around that age. Most of them don\u2019t end up living in homelessness and addiction. And most kids know both of those things.  They know weed isn\u2019t a gateway drug, they know plenty of people drink or smoke socially or even daily and are fine.  \n\nWhen risks are overstated and kids know it, they tend to dismiss everything they\u2019re told about it.\n\nI do understand where you\u2019re coming from given your history with addiction, but I think you\u2019re foisting too much of that onto your son. He is going to experiment no matter what - it\u2019s more important that he have a robust sense of self and trust in you, than that he be scared.", "NAH, I don't think you did anything wrong but it's also not going to work. 15 is about when a lot of kids start drinking and smoking a bit, and if it's what his friends are doing he'll be doing it too. And these scared-straight things don't work because he'll inevitably interact with people who drink and smoke and are doing just fine \u2013 which, to be fair, a lot of people are. I can completely understand why with your history you'd have a strong reaction, but teenagers are gonna do teenager things no matter what.", "Yta only because his mom seems blindsided by this?

You're in a partnership not a dictatorship. \n\nAlso have you told him your story?  Also that he may be at risk to be an addict genetically because you are? \n\nThis is all important. Not just scaring him straight.", "NTA and congrats on beating heroin and staying sober.", "Btw, you\u2019ve only been sober for 10 years. From heroin. Please be careful keeping in such close contact with people you used to use with.", "NTA yet. \n\nBackground is my parents did this all growing up.  I've seen jails, prisons, homeless camps, thousands of hours of community service like soup kitchens, trash pickups, etc., and then eventually i went through years of therapy to fix the self-esteem, anxiety, and depression  issues that developed over years of being told that I was becoming just like these people and that I needed to change my behavior or I was destined to end up there.  I was in poverty and on the brink of homelessness because of depression and  self-esteem/shame issues. I eventually naturally chose abstinence more and more once I was able to overcome how my brain was trained to perceive myself over the course of my childhood.\n\n \"Let's go take a tour of the homeless camps\" isn't necessarily bad but it's a small gap from that to your child hearing something along the lines of \"this is how I see you\" \"this is your only future\".  It doesn't matter if that's what you meant or intended, it matters how your child took it. \n\nTHIS IS DAMN IMPORTANT:  nothing past this point is specifically about your situation.  All references to anything adjacent to a \"you\" are meant as royal, a.k.a \"if you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band\" does not literally refer to me when I listen to the song, or \"you can't just keep tapping the a button during a loading screen and expect it to do anything\" isn't targeted to me when it's expressed somewhere.  Hopefully this paragraph is long enough to be noticed so we can move on from this point woth understanding that the only assertions I've made about you and your situation are that tours are close to unkind impressions.  I grew up in a fucked up situation and this is presented as something to be careful to avoid, not an assertion that you have in fact done any of this.\n\n I spent 16-25 binge drinking, smoking weed, doing mushrooms, tried extacy, did maybe like a couple tenths of a gram of meth over a weekend to party for 36 hours straight, occasional cocaine bump or two, and even played with some of the og spice shit.  Late twenties into early thirties and now I rarely choose to drink in small amounts and do about two dabs a day to help the stomach problems I've had since childhood because it's a few thousand dollars cheaper a month(haven't been high in years).  This is not to say any of that was a good idea, but to contrast with your own experiences.  You can set your foot down on drinking and drugs and explain the dangers and why it's a bad idea and all the legitimate reasons not to do drugs.  What you shouldn't do is start projecting your experience onto your child. \" You're not allowed to do this yet\" is not in the same league with overreacting and asserting wildly that underage drinking and weed is on the same level as heroin addiction.  It's just blatantly not and your kid knows this.  The only part of your child's reality you are going to affect comparing these two things are how much they can trust you not to bullshit them for your own temporary perception of gain or compliance.\n\nIt's not reasonable that a teenager caught drinking and smoking weed is necessarily or even more likely to end up homeless or addicted.  Some of the most out of control (as in sloppy or overindulgent, not violent) individuals I've met (generally speaking and as a group) is people who never experimented and then were all the sudden cut loose on the bottle or the high for the first time at 19 or 20 when there are no restraints at all.  When they're not worried about toning it down because they gotta sneak past mom and dad.  Trying to throw heroin addiction levels of shame or regret at a joint and an underage party is a close neighbor to demonstrating that the cool druggie kids are not going to provide a promising path for his future.", "NTA. You know why DARE didn\u2019t work? It was a bunch of talking and nonsense. You know first hand the perils of addiction and you showed him.", "NTA. Probably an aggressive move to go straight to the scared straight route but you've bought yourself a year or so before he realizes drinking 40's in the woods is probably not gonna lead him to mainlining smack.", "i\u2019m gonna say nta. weed and alcohol at his age probably won\u2019t lead to anything on its own, but where i grew up a lot of people ended up addicted to drugs and it\u2019s scary how easily it can happen. this is a reality that teenagers should be aware of before it\u2019s an issue, not after, so as long as you were careful i think it\u2019s okay.", "NTA, \n\nthe whole point was that it is dangerous, the whole scare them with reality routine is all about showing them what it looks like. \n\nIm not sure if it'll sink in with your son in the long term but doing it was not wrong in a vacuum. Is suggest a more wholistic approach to solving your alchohol/drugs issue, showing him the dangers may not be enough to get him off it, you should keep working to help him in other ways too.

Taking a kid to see a bunch of heroin addicts as punishment for smoking weed is exactly that style of teaching.", "Drug addicts don't just randomly attack people on the street and its not like he took the kid out at 3am. Hundreds (if not thousands) of people walk through the east van/hastings area every day for regular commuting or shopping.", "i feel like everyone saying \u201cNTA\u201d to this is probably not a recovered/recovering addict coming from an overbearing and/or abusive home life where \u2018scare tactics\u2019 were at play. this is so horribly dehumanizing. nevermind that my dad did this to me\u2014and it was over, i shit you not, bad grades. guess what! i ended up hiding even *more* things, far worse and detrimental things, from him\u2026and becoming an addict anyway.

Sure weed isnt a gateway drug, but addiction may run in the family. Not only is this a way for his son to see what drugs can do, but its a way to give back to the community and do some good.

For other people, this is wholly wrong. It's not the weed specifically that catches you, it's the crowd. You rarely find opioid addicts who don't smoke weed, not the other way around. Stats show that weed might not lead you to opioids, but you don't get to opioids except through weed, except in rare exceptions like injuries or romantic relationships.", "Every bit of this. Spot on.\n\nPeople, including young ones, know when someone is exaggerating for effect and it just makes them disregard the message even if the message is decent. \n\nYTA for acting as if drinking or smoking weed is a gateway to homelessness and addiction. It's not 1940. \n\nIt is important to focus on the actual risks, such as cannabis negatively impacting brain function and development in young people, and drunk driving.", "Hard disagree. Working in an ER at 19 completely changed my parties. Did for most of the other CNAs too. Saw the effects of drinking and driving - cleaned up the blood. Of the kid HIT by the drunk driver. Saw the effects of too much alcohol  - one chick passed out, her \"friends\" tossed her in the bed of a truck. Wearing those spray-on jeans from back in the day. She'd shat herself, and it squooshed throughout her jeans, and then dried, cementing them to her body. Stench of her alcohol $#!*s was incredible. Saw the effects of the ODs. Told the families if there, often 'friends' ditched the OD as soon as they called 911. So the last thing many saw was their friends leaving as they died alone. At least they called 911 though, I'll give them that. 'Always use your skillsaw PRIOR to your meth.'\n\nBefore moving to the area and becoming a CNA (we aren't talking intensive study here, got it in a couple months over the summer), i had been a promoter on the rave scene in NYC in the early 90s. GREAT parties. I saw a TON of drugs helping people have a BLAST!! I'd had a blast on a number of them. After a few weekends working the ER? I still drank - some. Might have a hit if someone was passing a joint, but I wasn't buying and I sure as hell wasn't taking any stronger. And neither were the other teens and early 20s working with me.", "It\u2019s not about him smoking weed and drinking though it\u2019s the fact that the kid is 15 and doing it.

The best we can do is empower them to hopefully make good decisions for themselves and trust their parents when they have questions or experiences they want to talk about.", "I understand that, but taking the kid to see heroin addicts on the street is an incredibly stupid way to teach him not to do that. If you want to teach somebody not to drink alcohol or smoke pot, you tell them the actual risks of drinking alcohol and smoking pot, you don't try to imply they'll wind up a heroin addict, because they know that's bullshit and now they don't trust you on the subject.

He even talked about how important it was to him to go and give them food.", "The only thing I want to point out is that in many cases, there's a genetic link in drug abuse. Not everyone who drinks or experiments is going to be an addict, but if you have a kid with a family history of abuse, I get why the dad came on strong.", "Yeah I mean I can see both sides of it honestly.

Kids don\u2019t see themselves like that - they just don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever turn out that way. \n\nIt\u2019s a longterm thing, raising them so they are confident in themselves and trust their parents. Parent them in a way that doesn\u2019t result in accidental trauma. Communicate openly and freely about everything, so they come to you when they have questions or if something scary happened to them. That will hopefully result in resilient kids who don\u2019t want or need to get heavily involved in drugs; kids who can say no to drugs they don\u2019t want to use; kids who can talk to you about it if they do try something; kids who can trust you not to freak out or punish them when they open up."]}
