It\u2019s pretty much the norm for that age so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. I do agree that 15 is too young, especially for the pot because his brain is still developing and it does make you lazy and apathetic and that\u2019s not the age you want to be feeling that way for. I would try to explain that part to him and try not to do the typical \u201cscared straight\u201d route. Kids smoke pot, they just do, but if you can have a respectful conversation on his level on the negatives of abusing it at a young age while understanding where he\u2019s coming from I think it will get through to him more.", "NAH, but this was a stupid way to teach the kid.\n\nYou basically DARE'd him. Telling somebody that weed is addictive and a gateway to hard drug use, even implicitly, is so obviously bullshit that you've made any actually good anti-drug messages you give seem equally stupid.", "NTA, it will probably do more good than any talk will.

It's best to use what you know from experience to try and get him on the right track before he starts experimenting with harder things.", "NTA\n\nLet him see what happens with drug and alcohol use and abuse.

You need to be careful not to create a self fulfilling prophecy from something that might be a one and only thing.", "NTA. This is a case of \"Better to ask forgiveness than permission.\"", "YTA. Not only was that extreme, you should know from experience that addicts are unpredictable and that can sometimes lead to a dangerous situation.", "YTA. \nThis was not the way to go about it. \nAlso weed is not the gateway drug people think it is. Sure it isn't 100% harmless, but most people do not smoke a joint in their teens and end up shooting up heroin by the time they graduate. \n\nI'm exaggerating here, but this was reckless parenting. You could have sat your son down and had a calm conversation about the consequences the weed and indeed other drugs can have. This includes alcohol. \n\nChances are your son is going to make even more sure he hides the weed from his parents. \n\nPersonally, if I were a parent, I'd feel much better knowing my son smoked under my roof and know that if something went wrong, he'd feel safe rather than not having any idea.\n\nIt also sounds like your projecting your experiences onto your son and that isn't fair. You might want to consider therapy for yourself.", "YTA\u2026 not for taking him out, because I don\u2019t think he was at much risk with you, but for overstating the risks. Most teens start experimenting with weed and booze around that age. Most of them don\u2019t end up living in homelessness and addiction. And most kids know both of those things.  They know weed isn\u2019t a gateway drug, they know plenty of people drink or smoke socially or even daily and are fine.  \n\nWhen risks are overstated and kids know it, they tend to dismiss everything they\u2019re told about it.\n\nI do understand where you\u2019re coming from given your history with addiction, but I think you\u2019re foisting too much of that onto your son. He is going to experiment no matter what - it\u2019s more important that he have a robust sense of self and trust in you, than that he be scared.", "NAH, I don't think you did anything wrong but it's also not going to work. 15 is about when a lot of kids start drinking and smoking a bit, and if it's what his friends are doing he'll be doing it too. And these scared-straight things don't work because he'll inevitably interact with people who drink and smoke and are doing just fine \u2013 which, to be fair, a lot of people are. I can completely understand why with your history you'd have a strong reaction, but teenagers are gonna do teenager things no matter what.", "Yta only because his mom seems blindsided by this?

Please be careful keeping in such close contact with people you used to use with.", "NTA yet. \n\nBackground is my parents did this all growing up.  I've seen jails, prisons, homeless camps, thousands of hours of community service like soup kitchens, trash pickups, etc., and then eventually i went through years of therapy to fix the self-esteem, anxiety, and depression  issues that developed over years of being told that I was becoming just like these people and that I needed to change my behavior or I was destined to end up there.  I was in poverty and on the brink of homelessness because of depression and  self-esteem/shame issues. I eventually naturally chose abstinence more and more once I was able to overcome how my brain was trained to perceive myself over the course of my childhood.\n\n \"Let's go take a tour of the homeless camps\" isn't necessarily bad but it's a small gap from that to your child hearing something along the lines of \"this is how I see you\" \"this is your only future\".  It doesn't matter if that's what you meant or intended, it matters how your child took it. \n\nTHIS IS DAMN IMPORTANT:  nothing past this point is specifically about your situation.  All references to anything adjacent to a \"you\" are meant as royal, a.k.a \"if you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band\" does not literally refer to me when I listen to the song, or \"you can't just keep tapping the a button during a loading screen and expect it to do anything\" isn't targeted to me when it's expressed somewhere.  Hopefully this paragraph is long enough to be noticed so we can move on from this point woth understanding that the only assertions I've made about you and your situation are that tours are close to unkind impressions.  I grew up in a fucked up situation and this is presented as something to be careful to avoid, not an assertion that you have in fact done any of this.\n\n I spent 16-25 binge drinking, smoking weed, doing mushrooms, tried extacy, did maybe like a couple tenths of a gram of meth over a weekend to party for 36 hours straight, occasional cocaine bump or two, and even played with some of the og spice shit.  Late twenties into early thirties and now I rarely choose to drink in small amounts and do about two dabs a day to help the stomach problems I've had since childhood because it's a few thousand dollars cheaper a month(haven't been high in years).  This is not to say any of that was a good idea, but to contrast with your own experiences.  You can set your foot down on drinking and drugs and explain the dangers and why it's a bad idea and all the legitimate reasons not to do drugs.  What you shouldn't do is start projecting your experience onto your child. \" You're not allowed to do this yet\" is not in the same league with overreacting and asserting wildly that underage drinking and weed is on the same level as heroin addiction.  It's just blatantly not and your kid knows this.  The only part of your child's reality you are going to affect comparing these two things are how much they can trust you not to bullshit them for your own temporary perception of gain or compliance.\n\nIt's not reasonable that a teenager caught drinking and smoking weed is necessarily or even more likely to end up homeless or addicted.  Some of the most out of control (as in sloppy or overindulgent, not violent) individuals I've met (generally speaking and as a group) is people who never experimented and then were all the sudden cut loose on the bottle or the high for the first time at 19 or 20 when there are no restraints at all.  When they're not worried about toning it down because they gotta sneak past mom and dad.  Trying to throw heroin addiction levels of shame or regret at a joint and an underage party is a close neighbor to demonstrating that the cool druggie kids are not going to provide a promising path for his future.", "NTA. You know why DARE didn\u2019t work? It was a bunch of talking and nonsense. You know first hand the perils of addiction and you showed him.", "NTA. Probably an aggressive move to go straight to the scared straight route but you've bought yourself a year or so before he realizes drinking 40's in the woods is probably not gonna lead him to mainlining smack.", "i\u2019m gonna say nta. weed and alcohol at his age probably won\u2019t lead to anything on its own, but where i grew up a lot of people ended up addicted to drugs and it\u2019s scary how easily it can happen. this is a reality that teenagers should be aware of before it\u2019s an issue, not after, so as long as you were careful i think it\u2019s okay.", "NTA, \n\nthe whole point was that it is dangerous, the whole scare them with reality routine is all about showing them what it looks like. \n\nIm not sure if it'll sink in with your son in the long term but doing it was not wrong in a vacuum.

Taking a kid to see a bunch of heroin addicts as punishment for smoking weed is exactly that style of teaching.", "Drug addicts don't just randomly attack people on the street and its not like he took the kid out at 3am. Hundreds (if not thousands) of people walk through the east van/hastings area every day for regular commuting or shopping.", "i feel like everyone saying \u201cNTA\u201d to this is probably not a recovered/recovering addict coming from an overbearing and/or abusive home life where \u2018scare tactics\u2019 were at play. this is so horribly dehumanizing. nevermind that my dad did this to me\u2014and it was over, i shit you not, bad grades. guess what! i ended up hiding even *more* things, far worse and detrimental things, from him\u2026and becoming an addict anyway.

Sure weed isnt a gateway drug, but addiction may run in the family. Not only is this a way for his son to see what drugs can do, but its a way to give back to the community and do some good.

For other people, this is wholly wrong. It's not the weed specifically that catches you, it's the crowd. You rarely find opioid addicts who don't smoke weed, not the other way around. Stats show that weed might not lead you to opioids, but you don't get to opioids except through weed, except in rare exceptions like injuries or romantic relationships.", "Every bit of this.

Working in an ER at 19 completely changed my parties. Did for most of the other CNAs too. Saw the effects of drinking and driving - cleaned up the blood. Of the kid HIT by the drunk driver. Saw the effects of too much alcohol  - one chick passed out, her \"friends\" tossed her in the bed of a truck. Wearing those spray-on jeans from back in the day. She'd shat herself, and it squooshed throughout her jeans, and then dried, cementing them to her body. Stench of her alcohol $#!*s was incredible. Saw the effects of the ODs. Told the families if there, often 'friends' ditched the OD as soon as they called 911. So the last thing many saw was their friends leaving as they died alone. At least they called 911 though, I'll give them that. 'Always use your skillsaw PRIOR to your meth.'\n\nBefore moving to the area and becoming a CNA (we aren't talking intensive study here, got it in a couple months over the summer), i had been a promoter on the rave scene in NYC in the early 90s. GREAT parties. I saw a TON of drugs helping people have a BLAST!! I'd had a blast on a number of them. After a few weekends working the ER? I still drank - some.

I think that's great that you showed him how bad things can get.", "I\u2019d smoke and drink too if my Mom named me Gavin.", "NTA au contraire...good parenting I would do the same", "NAH your son is copying your previous behavior and you\u2019re trying to show him just how bad that life can become. Mom would still like to protect him from some of the world\u2019s harsh realities. Maybe go for a more sheltered approach by volunteering at a soup kitchen instead of just walking the streets if the lesson needs more emphasis. Make him take a few drug tests though and see if he likes it because that will be a regular occurrence in his future if he keeps messing with intoxicating substances. Talk to your wife before going all Scared Straight on him again and use a blended approach to getting the ideas through a thick teenage skull. Sometimes a shock therapy approach is the right way with some kids (my son has never played with matches again after he got caught and a firefighter friend showed him houses that had burned and just how much danger his playing with matches could have caused. My husband and I were both on board with that one though and we sat down with him afterwards and continued the discussion at home to clarify his understanding.", "WOW NTA You done such a great job and parents should learn from you and take a leaf out of your book. You are actually amazing you just totally saved your son from screwing up his life . Look half the jail cells are filled with people who couldn't control there kids growing up they have all done drugs, became addicted to alochal, even heroin like you were but you got clean and sober for your kid and you don't want him to go through with that you went through. The people who didn't get clean either end up in jail for stealing or worse they would do anything for there next fix massive massive credit to you!", "NTA at all. Perfect parenting", "NTA I was expecting you to be the asshole from the caption because it sounded like you were using other people as props for the lesson you wanted to teach your son, but the fact that you help these people and apparently engage with them as human beings makes the setting very different. I think, ideally, you'd talk about the moral lesson part with the people you're helping so they can exercise their agency over their involvement in it. But I don't think your son was in any danger in your company, to assume he was is based on stereotypes.", "YTA\n\nI get why you did it, but Fear is a shitty tool against addiction. \n\nSince you are an addict, I would have thought that you knew why people start using drugs: they think drugs help them in some way. Real or imagined. Ask him what he gets out of it & brainstorm replacements. \n\nEven still, your son needs to know how to responsibly use these substances, the risks involved & encouragement on putting safeguards into practice. How to know if he has a problem and the resources available to him if he thinks he does. If that\u2019s too hard or risks your sobriety, ask a friend who is into that kind of stuff to talk to him. \n\nBc Even if he quits today, that knowledge would go on to help somebody else. Creating fear helps nobody, except maybe your conscience. \n\nMy lil cousin has never smoked but I definitely gave him the talk so he knows what is normal and what is weird. And that kept one of his bffs from smoking something that was laced. \n\nJudgement & a fear based approach just means he won\u2019t come to you until it\u2019s too late.", "NTA. You shared with your son some valuable personal experience at a time when he is starting to make his own choices about substance use. Hopefully you also shared your unconditional love for him and left the door open for honest questions and dialogue. Congratulations on your recovery and good luck with your son.", "NAH, but that\u2019s not how you\u2019re going to stop a 15 year old from smoking weed or drinking. There are plenty of people that smoke and drink and don\u2019t wind up as heroin addicts and he\u2019s aware of that. This is why DARE is a failure. \n\nDid you even speak to him to figure out why he started smoking and drinking? It\u2019s pretty normal for teenagers to start rebelling like this. Did you talk to him about how to recognise addiction? The actual effects of smoking and drinking at an early age? \n\nI get that you got freaked out because of your history, but this wasn\u2019t an effective way to make him stop.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur being an addict does not mean your son can not drink responsibly. YOU Failed at that .. HE does not have to. This is pushing your trauma on him. Get some therpy.", "I don\u2019t know if it is Going to work, the dad\u2019s thing, tho fingers crossed, but I went thru the DARE program too, and even as young and naive as I was I found it total bs.", "Acting as if alcohol or weed are the same as heroin does not work either tho. That is what they tried to do with us, that is how I know.", "He literally said they walked and talked. Why does he have to be sitting down?", "Did anyone ever tell you how impressive that is? If you're in the US, god damn. There's a lot of people on pain meds who aspire to be you in the future", "Most likely reason is \"it looked cool\" or \"I was curious\" or \"adults do that and I wanted to feel like adult\" or \"I wanted to look experienced/fun\" or some such. The reasons for 15 years old experimenting with alcohol or weed are not always super deep traumas or what not.", "One of the important facts I took from Juvenile Justice was that D.A.R.E. was a massive flop, and the single best anti-crime initiative for children was...\n\nHead Start breakfast program.\n\nThe breakfast program was the single surviving initiative that showed significant long-term crime avoidance in youth.  By feeding kids in the morning, schools reduced behavior issues and raised grade averages.  \n\nThe kids who got breakfast managed to avoid being separated early on in the school careers, which showed to be a major problem in public schools.  The classes that received the least help, the worst teaching aids, and the least amount of supplies were the lowest classes--the remedial groups.\n\nWhen together, these kids formed bonds that lead to adulthood.  They grew up getting in trouble.\n\nD.A.R.E. was connected to propaganda and useless pledges.  In fact, my daughter was cornered in an attempt to sign the Don't Drink Don't Do Drugs Ever pledge in sixth grade here.  She asked the officer if this meant she could never drink.  He said yes.  She said she could not sign in, then, because she wanted to drink champagne on New Years and at her wedding as a grown up.\n\nThen the officer said it was just a symbolic pledge, so she could sign it.\n\nMy kid told him if it was a symbolic pledge, it was not real, and she couldn't sign it.  He didn't get 100% completion for the class, which was the real goal, not helping kids, in my opinion.", "I don't think this is the same as DARE. This is a father sharing his personal experience of addiction and his own way of keeping his recovery fresh with his son at a time when his son is faced with choices about useing. Not a bunch of strangers with weird props trying to scare 10 year olds into promising never to do drugs", "You have obviously never seen anyone with an alcohol addiction then?  Just because alcohol is socially acceptable doesn\u2019t make it less damaging or dangerous. Especially at 15, and even more so as substance abuse disorder has a high degree of heritability.", "So have a conversation about why he\u2019s too young to be getting into weed and alcohol?\n\nDon\u2019t try to scare him by lying to him about how doing it is going to turn him into a heroin addict.", "That is however not saying that at all. That is your rationalization of it, but not what was taught to the teenager.", "There is a recent article I read that was released talking about the effects on the endocannabinoid system (I'd have to go find it though I can't remember the title).  How endogenous endocannabinoids are reduced or no longer produced in an individual who partakes regularly.\n\nThose endogenous cannabinoids act to regulate your nervous system.  They can operate like a check; If a neurons receiving signals is overstimulated that neuron can release these endogenous endocannabinoids in an effort to decrease the incoming activity from connected neurons and back regulate their input.  Its the only mechanism shown to operate this way (retrograde regulation) that I know of when it comes to this type of neural self regulation.\n\nIt takes time for your body to reset and properly produce these endocannabinoids once abstaining.\n\nThat mechanism describes a potential avenue for physical and not just psychological addiction.  There are others as well.  I'm not writing a bigger comment than this though.\n\n  On top of this there are well documented physical withdrawal symptoms many people experience as a result of quitting after prolonged use.", "I can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s supposed to be wrong with the quoted text. \n\n\nRedditors have reached the point where they clutch their pearls at the suggestion \u201cliving like a heroin addict is bad", "That's literally what every DARE-like program does, minus the \"friend\" part. As long as OP wasn't in front of them talking loudly about how they're failures and you don't wanna be like them, I don't see a problem with making sure he sees it in person. It's not like OPs relationship with these people is soley to teach his son a lesson", "What was everyone's DARE program like? I felt mine was incredibly comprehensive.", "> I know a classmate who OD on weed\n\nLol", "Correlation does not indicate causation and there are no studies that show what you claim with any statistical certainty but at most find a pattern or correlation and they may posit a causal link- they do not in fact actually show one.\n\nYou know what\u2019s just as likely? That individuals with a predisposition towards addiction or that are likely to progress / do progress into harder drugs tend to try weed first because it\u2019s the first drug they can get access to. To suggest that that experience somehow is the reason they use other drugs as well is just not true or accurate. Are there perhaps certain specific individuals that may never have touched another drug if they didn\u2019t use weed first? Sure. Is that because weed inherently leads to harder drugs? No. There are a million reasons why someone may or may not end up trying other drugs and to boil it down to did you smoke and/or drink alone is just a completely wrong view of addiction. \n\nHeavy use of weed or alcohol at a young age is troubling because of the implications on brain development sure and there are lots of valid reasons to not be ok with your 15 year old smoking or drinking\u2026because they\u2019re gateway drugs is not one of them or at least shouldn\u2019t be.", "I agree with you. A 19 year old kid in a college party smoking weed and having a few beers? Completely normal. A 15 year old? That\u2019s not okay. Majority of his peers are not drinking and smoking. At his age, he shouldn\u2019t be in those environments. Seeing the fact that at his age he is already doing this would definitely put any reasonable parent into a question of who he is hanging out with and why he is using these substances.", "Thank you for giving the neighborhood kids a safe place to crash -- you probably *really* helped some folks.\n\nHaving parents who you trust to talk to about drugs and alcohol also makes a huge difference in demystifying it and helping kids resist pressure and make smarter choices, and it sounds like your kids trusted you to have those conversations. I suspect that had just as much influence on them as you sharing any horror stories you'd seen.", "It's not that smoking weed was a physical pathway, it put him in touch with people who were willing to break the law. \n\nA recent study showed that people who are more likely to get addicted are the same ones who take more dangerous drugs. It's about risk reward and their attitude to their own life. People who take heroin are more capable of being addicted to any substance. People who look at those most dangerous substances and say no are also more responsible with less dangerous drugs. And alcohol too.\n\nPutting all drugs in a single box is the reason there is a slippery slope for your brother to slide down. If he wasn't taught weed will make you insane after a toke he may have not decided that perhaps the risks of heroin were overstated. If he didn't have to find people willing to break the law to get it he may never have been offered it. And if he didn't already have the underlying issues to proceed like that he probably wouldn't have risked it anyway", "The problem is that when you treat the less harmful drugs the same as the actual life ruining ones, your kid is going to realize that you have been lying to them when they try the less harmful ones and still manage to live normal lives and function in society. \n\nAnd that makes them think that maybe you were also lying about the drugs you told the truth about."]}
