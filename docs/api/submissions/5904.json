It\u2019s pretty much the norm for that age so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. I do agree that 15 is too young, especially for the pot because his brain is still developing and it does make you lazy and apathetic and that\u2019s not the age you want to be feeling that way for. I would try to explain that part to him and try not to do the typical \u201cscared straight\u201d route. Kids smoke pot, they just do, but if you can have a respectful conversation on his level on the negatives of abusing it at a young age while understanding where he\u2019s coming from I think it will get through to him more.", "NAH, but this was a stupid way to teach the kid.\n\nYou basically DARE'd him. Telling somebody that weed is addictive and a gateway to hard drug use, even implicitly, is so obviously bullshit that you've made any actually good anti-drug messages you give seem equally stupid.", "NTA, it will probably do more good than any talk will.

Not only was that extreme, you should know from experience that addicts are unpredictable and that can sometimes lead to a dangerous situation.", "YTA. \nThis was not the way to go about it. \nAlso weed is not the gateway drug people think it is. Sure it isn't 100% harmless, but most people do not smoke a joint in their teens and end up shooting up heroin by the time they graduate. \n\nI'm exaggerating here, but this was reckless parenting. You could have sat your son down and had a calm conversation about the consequences the weed and indeed other drugs can have. This includes alcohol. \n\nChances are your son is going to make even more sure he hides the weed from his parents. \n\nPersonally, if I were a parent, I'd feel much better knowing my son smoked under my roof and know that if something went wrong, he'd feel safe rather than not having any idea.\n\nIt also sounds like your projecting your experiences onto your son and that isn't fair. You might want to consider therapy for yourself.", "YTA\u2026 not for taking him out, because I don\u2019t think he was at much risk with you, but for overstating the risks. Most teens start experimenting with weed and booze around that age. Most of them don\u2019t end up living in homelessness and addiction. And most kids know both of those things.  They know weed isn\u2019t a gateway drug, they know plenty of people drink or smoke socially or even daily and are fine.  \n\nWhen risks are overstated and kids know it, they tend to dismiss everything they\u2019re told about it.\n\nI do understand where you\u2019re coming from given your history with addiction, but I think you\u2019re foisting too much of that onto your son. He is going to experiment no matter what - it\u2019s more important that he have a robust sense of self and trust in you, than that he be scared.", "NAH, I don't think you did anything wrong but it's also not going to work. 15 is about when a lot of kids start drinking and smoking a bit, and if it's what his friends are doing he'll be doing it too. And these scared-straight things don't work because he'll inevitably interact with people who drink and smoke and are doing just fine \u2013 which, to be fair, a lot of people are. I can completely understand why with your history you'd have a strong reaction, but teenagers are gonna do teenager things no matter what.", "Yta only because his mom seems blindsided by this?

Please be careful keeping in such close contact with people you used to use with.", "NTA yet. \n\nBackground is my parents did this all growing up.  I've seen jails, prisons, homeless camps, thousands of hours of community service like soup kitchens, trash pickups, etc., and then eventually i went through years of therapy to fix the self-esteem, anxiety, and depression  issues that developed over years of being told that I was becoming just like these people and that I needed to change my behavior or I was destined to end up there.  I was in poverty and on the brink of homelessness because of depression and  self-esteem/shame issues. I eventually naturally chose abstinence more and more once I was able to overcome how my brain was trained to perceive myself over the course of my childhood.\n\n \"Let's go take a tour of the homeless camps\" isn't necessarily bad but it's a small gap from that to your child hearing something along the lines of \"this is how I see you\" \"this is your only future\".  It doesn't matter if that's what you meant or intended, it matters how your child took it. \n\nTHIS IS DAMN IMPORTANT:  nothing past this point is specifically about your situation.  All references to anything adjacent to a \"you\" are meant as royal, a.k.a \"if you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band\" does not literally refer to me when I listen to the song, or \"you can't just keep tapping the a button during a loading screen and expect it to do anything\" isn't targeted to me when it's expressed somewhere.  Hopefully this paragraph is long enough to be noticed so we can move on from this point woth understanding that the only assertions I've made about you and your situation are that tours are close to unkind impressions.  I grew up in a fucked up situation and this is presented as something to be careful to avoid, not an assertion that you have in fact done any of this.\n\n I spent 16-25 binge drinking, smoking weed, doing mushrooms, tried extacy, did maybe like a couple tenths of a gram of meth over a weekend to party for 36 hours straight, occasional cocaine bump or two, and even played with some of the og spice shit.  Late twenties into early thirties and now I rarely choose to drink in small amounts and do about two dabs a day to help the stomach problems I've had since childhood because it's a few thousand dollars cheaper a month(haven't been high in years).  This is not to say any of that was a good idea, but to contrast with your own experiences.  You can set your foot down on drinking and drugs and explain the dangers and why it's a bad idea and all the legitimate reasons not to do drugs.  What you shouldn't do is start projecting your experience onto your child. \" You're not allowed to do this yet\" is not in the same league with overreacting and asserting wildly that underage drinking and weed is on the same level as heroin addiction.  It's just blatantly not and your kid knows this.  The only part of your child's reality you are going to affect comparing these two things are how much they can trust you not to bullshit them for your own temporary perception of gain or compliance.\n\nIt's not reasonable that a teenager caught drinking and smoking weed is necessarily or even more likely to end up homeless or addicted.  Some of the most out of control (as in sloppy or overindulgent, not violent) individuals I've met (generally speaking and as a group) is people who never experimented and then were all the sudden cut loose on the bottle or the high for the first time at 19 or 20 when there are no restraints at all.  When they're not worried about toning it down because they gotta sneak past mom and dad.  Trying to throw heroin addiction levels of shame or regret at a joint and an underage party is a close neighbor to demonstrating that the cool druggie kids are not going to provide a promising path for his future.", "NTA. You know why DARE didn\u2019t work? It was a bunch of talking and nonsense. You know first hand the perils of addiction and you showed him.", "NTA. Probably an aggressive move to go straight to the scared straight route but you've bought yourself a year or so before he realizes drinking 40's in the woods is probably not gonna lead him to mainlining smack.", "i\u2019m gonna say nta. weed and alcohol at his age probably won\u2019t lead to anything on its own, but where i grew up a lot of people ended up addicted to drugs and it\u2019s scary how easily it can happen. this is a reality that teenagers should be aware of before it\u2019s an issue, not after, so as long as you were careful i think it\u2019s okay.", "NTA, \n\nthe whole point was that it is dangerous, the whole scare them with reality routine is all about showing them what it looks like. \n\nIm not sure if it'll sink in with your son in the long term but doing it was not wrong in a vacuum.

Taking a kid to see a bunch of heroin addicts as punishment for smoking weed is exactly that style of teaching.", "Drug addicts don't just randomly attack people on the street and its not like he took the kid out at 3am. Hundreds (if not thousands) of people walk through the east van/hastings area every day for regular commuting or shopping.", "i feel like everyone saying \u201cNTA\u201d to this is probably not a recovered/recovering addict coming from an overbearing and/or abusive home life where \u2018scare tactics\u2019 were at play. this is so horribly dehumanizing. nevermind that my dad did this to me\u2014and it was over, i shit you not, bad grades. guess what! i ended up hiding even *more* things, far worse and detrimental things, from him\u2026and becoming an addict anyway.

Alcohol has killed multiple of my family members, including my sibling. So thanks for that.", ">They know weed isn\u2019t a gateway drug, \n\nFor many people this is true. For other people, this is wholly wrong. It's not the weed specifically that catches you, it's the crowd. You rarely find opioid addicts who don't smoke weed, not the other way around. Stats show that weed might not lead you to opioids, but you don't get to opioids except through weed, except in rare exceptions like injuries or romantic relationships.", "Every bit of this.

Working in an ER at 19 completely changed my parties. Did for most of the other CNAs too. Saw the effects of drinking and driving - cleaned up the blood. Of the kid HIT by the drunk driver. Saw the effects of too much alcohol  - one chick passed out, her \"friends\" tossed her in the bed of a truck. Wearing those spray-on jeans from back in the day. She'd shat herself, and it squooshed throughout her jeans, and then dried, cementing them to her body. Stench of her alcohol $#!*s was incredible. Saw the effects of the ODs. Told the families if there, often 'friends' ditched the OD as soon as they called 911. So the last thing many saw was their friends leaving as they died alone. At least they called 911 though, I'll give them that. 'Always use your skillsaw PRIOR to your meth.'\n\nBefore moving to the area and becoming a CNA (we aren't talking intensive study here, got it in a couple months over the summer), i had been a promoter on the rave scene in NYC in the early 90s. GREAT parties. I saw a TON of drugs helping people have a BLAST!! I'd had a blast on a number of them. After a few weekends working the ER I still drank - some.

His son knows his past; this isn\u2019t some nebulous theoretical anecdote for their family.", "Oh please so many parents tell their kids what the consequences are and the kids still do it! Seeing it is far more effective than simply having someone tell you.", "People are so obsessed with weed they refuse to even listen to the negative side effects that are honestly worse than drinking. I have a degree in neuroscience and studied the effects of THC for years. I hope it is legalized everywhere soon so we can move the discussion from \u201cweed is illegal don\u2019t do it\u201d to what the actual very real negative effects of thc are", "Weed isn\u2019t the gateway drug everyone thinks it is. Your brother was probably already predisposed to addiction. \n\n\nI\u2019m sure he had caffeine from sodas, Nitrous oxide at the dentist, or even a low dose pain killer from a doctor at some point in his life before smoking any weed. Some people, for so many different reasons, are just more likely to seek out the mass release of dopamine/oxytocin that the vast majority of drugs produce. \n\n\n\nThat\u2019s all getting high is, just at different levels. The molecules in the drugs break through the blood brain barrier (you may already know all this since you had an addict in your life but I\u2019m elaborating for other that might read, not trying to be condescending!) and bind to the receptors in there. \n\n\nAll drugs are just a fast way to lie to your brain and convince it to make chemicals the individual is probably lacking for one reason or another. A lot of undiagnosed neuro-divergent folks will fall into drug use as forms of self medication because they don\u2019t know their brain isn\u2019t functioning the way it\u2019s supposed to. They just know drugs give them something they don\u2019t have. \n\n\n\n\nThis can also happen to neuro-typical people due to circumstance. Simon Fraser university did a cool study on this called rat park. They determined that rats who have their needs met (safe, comfortable, fed, other rats around to play with, etc) chose not to get addicted to morphine. They tried lacing the drugged water with sugar to encourage it\u2019s use, but the rats didn\u2019t want it because they didn\u2019t need it. When the rats were isolated in single cages, bored and depressed they all became morphine addicts. \n\n\n\nNo one wants to be a drug addict, and weed doesn\u2019t turn people into heroin addicts any more than the other drugs we are given as children, including sugar. (Which also releases dopamine when consumed. It\u2019s why a lot of recovered addicts have huge sweet tooth\u2019s and smoke lots of cigarettes) \n\n\n\nI would never have listened to my parents when I was a teenager if the way they approached me about smoking weed was to say, \u201cif you smoke weed you might turn out like that guy!\u201d And showed me a hard drug addict.

Now they\u2019re just lying to me, I don\u2019t believe this is as bad as they say.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nNow if they had said, \u201clook, smoking weed isn\u2019t going to make you a heroin addict, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t other risks involved. I smoked a ton of weed as a teenager and I regret it. It damaged my brain because I was altering it before it was fully developed. Weed won\u2019t make you crazy, but it will make your adult life harder if you stunt the growth of your frontal lobe. I wish I had just waited and then smoked all the weed I wanted later. And don\u2019t use it as an escape. Weed can make you okay with being bored, and it\u2019s when you\u2019re bored that you\u2019re supposed to create art, or learn something new. If you become content with boredom your life will feel purposeless which is the real killer here. If you feel the need to get high all the time then maybe we need to look at what\u2019s going on and find out what\u2019s missing in your life that makes this so appealing.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nI would have responded to that a lot more because it was a personal account, not a scare tactic. It was honest and upfront, most people appreciate that style of communication much more. If it doesn\u2019t work, then there is probably more at play. Most teenagers are too young to realize what is actually effecting them. A parents divorce, hard time at school, past trauma, whatever. \n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s up to the adults in their lives to fulfill them and find them purpose so they don\u2019t want to lean on drugs for stimulation. Weed is fine in moderation. It\u2019s not physically addictive like nicotine, alcohol, or heroine.

Knowing people way overreact about weed and lie about it\u2019s nature then drives kids to be more comfortable trying to harder stuff, because if people lie this much about something as harmless as weed surely they must be lying about the other drugs too.

I'm saying that there's an effective and ineffective way to teach kids about the consequences of drug use.

Most kids are aware of the fact that marijuana on its own is safe and don't take into account that it's dangerous when you're still growing and is often laced with pretty horrible stuff when you get it on the street. You should be teaching them that as well as how you're trusting someone who you don't know with a substance that you're going to consume and really highlight how there's no regulations and even when it's pure it can be harmful while you're growing rather than telling them off the bat that it'll lead to heroin addiction since that comes across as extreme and laughable and they're less likely to trust you.
