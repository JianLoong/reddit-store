It\u2019s pretty much the norm for that age so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. I do agree that 15 is too young, especially for the pot because his brain is still developing and it does make you lazy and apathetic and that\u2019s not the age you want to be feeling that way for. I would try to explain that part to him and try not to do the typical \u201cscared straight\u201d route. Kids smoke pot, they just do, but if you can have a respectful conversation on his level on the negatives of abusing it at a young age while understanding where he\u2019s coming from I think it will get through to him more.", "NAH, but this was a stupid way to teach the kid.\n\nYou basically DARE'd him. Telling somebody that weed is addictive and a gateway to hard drug use, even implicitly, is so obviously bullshit that you've made any actually good anti-drug messages you give seem equally stupid.", "NTA, it will probably do more good than any talk will.

It's best to use what you know from experience to try and get him on the right track before he starts experimenting with harder things.", "NTA\n\nLet him see what happens with drug and alcohol use and abuse.

You need to be careful not to create a self fulfilling prophecy from something that might be a one and only thing.", "NTA. This is a case of \"Better to ask forgiveness than permission.\"", "YTA. Not only was that extreme, you should know from experience that addicts are unpredictable and that can sometimes lead to a dangerous situation.", "YTA. \nThis was not the way to go about it. \nAlso weed is not the gateway drug people think it is. Sure it isn't 100% harmless, but most people do not smoke a joint in their teens and end up shooting up heroin by the time they graduate. \n\nI'm exaggerating here, but this was reckless parenting. You could have sat your son down and had a calm conversation about the consequences the weed and indeed other drugs can have. This includes alcohol. \n\nChances are your son is going to make even more sure he hides the weed from his parents. \n\nPersonally, if I were a parent, I'd feel much better knowing my son smoked under my roof and know that if something went wrong, he'd feel safe rather than not having any idea.\n\nIt also sounds like your projecting your experiences onto your son and that isn't fair. You might want to consider therapy for yourself.", "YTA\u2026 not for taking him out, because I don\u2019t think he was at much risk with you, but for overstating the risks. Most teens start experimenting with weed and booze around that age. Most of them don\u2019t end up living in homelessness and addiction. And most kids know both of those things.  They know weed isn\u2019t a gateway drug, they know plenty of people drink or smoke socially or even daily and are fine.  \n\nWhen risks are overstated and kids know it, they tend to dismiss everything they\u2019re told about it.\n\nI do understand where you\u2019re coming from given your history with addiction, but I think you\u2019re foisting too much of that onto your son. He is going to experiment no matter what - it\u2019s more important that he have a robust sense of self and trust in you, than that he be scared.", "NAH, I don't think you did anything wrong but it's also not going to work. 15 is about when a lot of kids start drinking and smoking a bit, and if it's what his friends are doing he'll be doing it too. And these scared-straight things don't work because he'll inevitably interact with people who drink and smoke and are doing just fine \u2013 which, to be fair, a lot of people are. I can completely understand why with your history you'd have a strong reaction, but teenagers are gonna do teenager things no matter what.", "Yta only because his mom seems blindsided by this?

Please be careful keeping in such close contact with people you used to use with.", "NTA yet. \n\nBackground is my parents did this all growing up.  I've seen jails, prisons, homeless camps, thousands of hours of community service like soup kitchens, trash pickups, etc., and then eventually i went through years of therapy to fix the self-esteem, anxiety, and depression  issues that developed over years of being told that I was becoming just like these people and that I needed to change my behavior or I was destined to end up there.  I was in poverty and on the brink of homelessness because of depression and  self-esteem/shame issues. I eventually naturally chose abstinence more and more once I was able to overcome how my brain was trained to perceive myself over the course of my childhood.\n\n \"Let's go take a tour of the homeless camps\" isn't necessarily bad but it's a small gap from that to your child hearing something along the lines of \"this is how I see you\" \"this is your only future\".  It doesn't matter if that's what you meant or intended, it matters how your child took it. \n\nTHIS IS DAMN IMPORTANT:  nothing past this point is specifically about your situation.  All references to anything adjacent to a \"you\" are meant as royal, a.k.a \"if you're gonna play in Texas, you gotta have a fiddle in the band\" does not literally refer to me when I listen to the song, or \"you can't just keep tapping the a button during a loading screen and expect it to do anything\" isn't targeted to me when it's expressed somewhere.  Hopefully this paragraph is long enough to be noticed so we can move on from this point woth understanding that the only assertions I've made about you and your situation are that tours are close to unkind impressions.  I grew up in a fucked up situation and this is presented as something to be careful to avoid, not an assertion that you have in fact done any of this.\n\n I spent 16-25 binge drinking, smoking weed, doing mushrooms, tried extacy, did maybe like a couple tenths of a gram of meth over a weekend to party for 36 hours straight, occasional cocaine bump or two, and even played with some of the og spice shit.  Late twenties into early thirties and now I rarely choose to drink in small amounts and do about two dabs a day to help the stomach problems I've had since childhood because it's a few thousand dollars cheaper a month(haven't been high in years).  This is not to say any of that was a good idea, but to contrast with your own experiences.  You can set your foot down on drinking and drugs and explain the dangers and why it's a bad idea and all the legitimate reasons not to do drugs.  What you shouldn't do is start projecting your experience onto your child. \" You're not allowed to do this yet\" is not in the same league with overreacting and asserting wildly that underage drinking and weed is on the same level as heroin addiction.  It's just blatantly not and your kid knows this.  The only part of your child's reality you are going to affect comparing these two things are how much they can trust you not to bullshit them for your own temporary perception of gain or compliance.\n\nIt's not reasonable that a teenager caught drinking and smoking weed is necessarily or even more likely to end up homeless or addicted.  Some of the most out of control (as in sloppy or overindulgent, not violent) individuals I've met (generally speaking and as a group) is people who never experimented and then were all the sudden cut loose on the bottle or the high for the first time at 19 or 20 when there are no restraints at all.  When they're not worried about toning it down because they gotta sneak past mom and dad.  Trying to throw heroin addiction levels of shame or regret at a joint and an underage party is a close neighbor to demonstrating that the cool druggie kids are not going to provide a promising path for his future.", "NTA. You know why DARE didn\u2019t work? It was a bunch of talking and nonsense. You know first hand the perils of addiction and you showed him.", "NTA. Probably an aggressive move to go straight to the scared straight route but you've bought yourself a year or so before he realizes drinking 40's in the woods is probably not gonna lead him to mainlining smack.", "i\u2019m gonna say nta. weed and alcohol at his age probably won\u2019t lead to anything on its own, but where i grew up a lot of people ended up addicted to drugs and it\u2019s scary how easily it can happen. this is a reality that teenagers should be aware of before it\u2019s an issue, not after, so as long as you were careful i think it\u2019s okay.", "NTA, \n\nthe whole point was that it is dangerous, the whole scare them with reality routine is all about showing them what it looks like. \n\nIm not sure if it'll sink in with your son in the long term but doing it was not wrong in a vacuum.

Taking a kid to see a bunch of heroin addicts as punishment for smoking weed is exactly that style of teaching.", "Drug addicts don't just randomly attack people on the street and its not like he took the kid out at 3am. Hundreds (if not thousands) of people walk through the east van/hastings area every day for regular commuting or shopping.", "i feel like everyone saying \u201cNTA\u201d to this is probably not a recovered/recovering addict coming from an overbearing and/or abusive home life where \u2018scare tactics\u2019 were at play. this is so horribly dehumanizing. nevermind that my dad did this to me\u2014and it was over, i shit you not, bad grades. guess what! i ended up hiding even *more* things, far worse and detrimental things, from him\u2026and becoming an addict anyway.

Sure weed isnt a gateway drug, but addiction may run in the family. Not only is this a way for his son to see what drugs can do, but its a way to give back to the community and do some good.

For other people, this is wholly wrong. It's not the weed specifically that catches you, it's the crowd. You rarely find opioid addicts who don't smoke weed, not the other way around. Stats show that weed might not lead you to opioids, but you don't get to opioids except through weed, except in rare exceptions like injuries or romantic relationships.", "Every bit of this.

Working in an ER at 19 completely changed my parties. Did for most of the other CNAs too. Saw the effects of drinking and driving - cleaned up the blood. Of the kid HIT by the drunk driver. Saw the effects of too much alcohol  - one chick passed out, her \"friends\" tossed her in the bed of a truck. Wearing those spray-on jeans from back in the day. She'd shat herself, and it squooshed throughout her jeans, and then dried, cementing them to her body. Stench of her alcohol $#!*s was incredible. Saw the effects of the ODs. Told the families if there, often 'friends' ditched the OD as soon as they called 911. So the last thing many saw was their friends leaving as they died alone. At least they called 911 though, I'll give them that. 'Always use your skillsaw PRIOR to your meth.'\n\nBefore moving to the area and becoming a CNA (we aren't talking intensive study here, got it in a couple months over the summer), i had been a promoter on the rave scene in NYC in the early 90s. GREAT parties. I saw a TON of drugs helping people have a BLAST!! I'd had a blast on a number of them. After a few weekends working the ER? I still drank - some.

How he can recognize if it's happening, how to avoid it, etc. \n\nWhat healthy activities and passions does your son have in his life? \n\nIs he depressed? \n\nDoes he have any traumatic events that he needs some counseling for? \n\nAre you close with him -- and does he know that he can come to you for ANYTHING no matter what he's done and that you'll be there for him?\n\nThose are the sorts of things that will fortify him against addiction.", "Reminds me of Uncle Hank taking Walter Junior out to see the people in meth", "NTA but I think this punishment was a bit harsh for a first strike offense. That being said, I'm sure he gained something from the experience as I'm sure most people would. I just think I would have given him one more chance before going this extreme.", "I show my kids videos and stuff all the time. Telling them isn't enough and you did a good job dad! Take him out with you more often!", "NTA but I also think it won\u2019t make a difference in whether or not he uses or drinks. Scared straight doesn\u2019t with if alcoholism or drug addiction are in your blood. I went through my addiction issues and know I would use the information he gained in this trip to find what I wanted when I wanted it.", "Why do so many people think you can't become addicted to smoking weed? It's different to the way you become addicted to an opioid but you absolutely can get addicted to it and the way it makes you feel, there are plenty of people who abuse weed. \n\nA lot of hard drug users will also tell you that weed is what they first started using before moving onto harder things.", "I've personally seen so many of my friends who used weed as a gateway drug. They come from very loving families and started using it just because of peer pressure. \nI'm not saying weed is horrible or anything like that but for a 15 year old it's very easy to transition into hard drugs from weed and alcohol. Curiosity and peer pressure can fuck up even the best of kids.", "I think it is also extremely important for OP to tell his son that because OP is a recovering addict, the son is at much greater risk for developing addictions on substances and that he is at greater risk for the lifestyle OP had before he was sober", "If you read the post you'd see it's people he used to use with. He vists regularly on his own to offer support. \n\nThey likely are well aware of his situation. \n\nIt isn't dehumanizing to introduce your kid to your friends.", "Maybe not instantly, but it\u2019s possible from there. I started at 14. It took a while and it wasn\u2019t heroin but crack. Was I out there on the streets, strung out? Yep, selling myself to get drugs? Yep. So for some people it may never happen but for others, it definitely will happen. Weed and alcohol IS exactly how it starts. So OP should do whatever it takes to get the truth in front of his son.", "Weed is not addictive. You can be addicted to it psychologically the same way you can be addicted to literally anything, but it is not an addictive drug in the sense that OP struggled with addiction and it is not reasonable to show a bunch of heroin addicts to a kid and suggest that's what he has in the future if he smokes weed, because it's obviously bullshit and will backfire.\n\nThe idea that weed is a gateway drug is also pretty much DARE bullshit. Yes, most hard drug users would say they started smoking weed, because *basically everybody* has smoked weed, but there's no study that ever suggested a causative link between smoking weed and taking up drugs later. There are better ways to teach a kid about addiction than jumping to transparent scared straight nonsense.", "\n>It isn't dehumanizing to introduce your kid to your friends.\n\nthat's a cute way of phrasing this to make it seem normal, but it absolutely is dehumanizing if your intent is to say \"look at how fucked up my friends are and how awful the lives they lead are. this could happen to you! now let's go home.\"", "This is exactly the kind of thing that doesn't work \u2013 big dramatic story that's not like the experience the average person is going to have. Hell, I've been to plenty of parties in NYC and I haven't been anywhere near that scene, let alone been a *teenage promoter* in it. That's a pretty extreme level of drug use and I'm glad you got out of there.\n\nBut most people are gonna get drunk with their friends, smoke a J, maybe do something stupid but not life-changing. When they're older they'll do some lines at a house party. The vast majority of people they meet who do this will be normal, well-adjusted people who happen to drink a bit or do some drugs. Telling outlier stories like they're not outliers just isn't effective \u2013 it worked on you because you were *already* an outlier. And it makes it harder for people to see when they really have gone too far down the alcohol or drug road where it's affecting their lives.", "> Weed and alcohol IS exactly how it starts.\n\nNo, it isn't. What studies actually show is that the gateway effect only meaningfully exists for kids who have a troubled or traumatic home life, so a serious addiction problem almost always starts with non drug-related trauma, and normal recreational drug usage by a healthy, well-cared for kid doesn't have any meaningful impact on their likelihood of later addiction.\n\n\"Doing whatever it takes\" to get the \"truth\" that weed is a dangerous gateway drug in front of his son is probably not going to do much either way, but if it does anything it's going to put a crack in the trust that otherwise acts as a shield against later drug use.", "Sure, and you know what's a great way to make a kid not avoid addictive drugs? Implying that weed is addictive and will result in you living on skid row with the heroin addicts.", "There are tons of studies that show a causative link between people who start doing drugs like weed and alcohol at a young age, like OP's son and developing serious drug problems later in life. \n\nA 15 year old who is smoking weed and drinking alcohol is far more likely to end up like the people OP showed him than someone who waits until they are older to experiment.", "It also worked for my kids. They're completely clean. Don't smoke, def don't drug, don't even like alcohol. I actually hoped they would experiment with alcohol before going to college so they wouldn't get taken by surprise with hangovers or anything. They just don't drink. Separately (but relatedly), I always had my couch as a safe place for neighborhood \"kids\" (20-somethings) to 'sleep it off' rather than driving anywhere after a night partying at the River. Saturday, Sunday mornings, we'd have people asleep on couches, on the floor, in their cars that they'd parked at my place, wherever, and make frozen waffles for them (it was a safe place to sleep, but we weren't going to be quiet while getting about our day). Kids saw the effects, and never had any urge to join in. My son will have a mixed drink now and again, but absolutely never overindulges. Daughter almost never even has a cocktail. The kids who stayed over were friends, and came over for dinners too, my kids still keep in touch with them even though mine left for college, so it wasn't a traumatic experience.  \n\nETA: I've asked them why they don't even drink socially for curiosity's sake, and both individually said (1) they don't like the taste, (2) their friends will need a DD and it's a great way to get free meal -friends pay the DD's way, and (3) while they knew I wouldn't be judgy, they had no interest in ending up as one of the kids on the couch. Mine weren't outliers, and the example still worked.", "Maybe you are right but at 15 you have a 50/50 chance of them trusting your word. Actually seeing it with your own eyes is very effective and eliminates the doubt of \"are they telling the truth/do they actually know or are they just saying it to make me stop\". \n\nNever saw an addict until I was in my 20s but saw real footage of how it is. I believe those were heroin addicts (faces blurred) and I'd say the state of their bodies was enough to convince me it is not worth it. I've never been drawn to narcotics so what i saw on that video made my decision solid. \n\nSometimes words are not enough. Sometimes we need to see with our own eyes to understand.", "I saw this more as the father saying, 'This is what I used to be like. Be careful.'", ">There are tons of studies that show a causative link between people who start doing drugs like weed and alcohol at a young age, like OP's son and developing serious drug problems later in life. \n\nWhich ones?", "There really aren't. Almost every study that concludes a gateway effect exist either fails to take into account class differential/upbringing, or finds no significant gateway effect or a very weak gateway effect on a very low initial chance of abusing drugs once that is factored in. In other words, the gateway effect only exists in the sense that for kids who are *already* have a traumatic or troubled childhood, weed means they likely have access to hard drugs and so a gateway effect exists in that specific context. For anybody in OP's situation, where their kid is (presumably) reasonably well cared for, the gateway effect would not meaningfully exist.", "Yes, which is a fair lesson if it isn't tied to catching the kid with weed, because implicitly telling the kid weed will result in ending up on skid row is the kind of obvious BS a teenager will chafe at.", "Don\u2019t expect a response, because these studies don\u2019t exist", "OP is a recovering addict, addiction runs in his family, his son is at much greater risk for developing these habits, I think he was being extreme but its far from ineffective", "The potential \u201czoo\u201d element was what bothered me the most about this. Couldn\u2019t OP talk to his son about his own experiences instead\u2026 potentially more powerful too? On the other hand, it sounds like OP knows those folks and goes there to check in and offer assistance, so maybe the trip didn\u2019t have that \u201dzoo\u201d vibe in reality. In fact, it could be good to take your child with you to help others and engage with people from more walks of life. It definitely makes me hesitant that OP sees the people he visits as a cautionary tale, but it\u2019s still possible that the visit was more good than bad. \n\nHowever, OP\u2019s wife is confirmed TA IMO because she assumed the son would be in danger.\n\nSigned, someone who\u2019s worked in Skid Row.", "Being extreme when it comes to drug messaging *is* being ineffective. Treating weed like it's a serious threat instead of actually educating people properly is a big reason why drug prevention programs are being treated like a joke, and if you step back and look past the fact OP himself is a recovering drug addict, you'll see he's using those exact same ineffective tactics here.\n\nIf he wants his kid not to drink and smoke drugs, he should be honest about the actual risks of doing that, not go for an after-school scared straight special."]}
