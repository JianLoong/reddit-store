He was like why the fuck did you name me after someone who hated their own damn name. My sister tried to lie and say he never hated his name. But my nephew knew the truth already. He told her he had a grandpa name and he hated it, that the name was ugly and not something he wanted to live with for the rest of his life and as soon as he is 18 he will be filing to change his name to the nickname he has used his whole life (not actually his whole life but he was like 4 when he got his nickname).\n\nMy sister was crying to me about it. I comforted her. She told me she needed to find a way to change his mind or he'd regret it forever when he realizes being Sky as an adult man will not get him very far and he will see that it's not a real name or something a grown man should need to use on everything. I told her she can't change how he feels about it though. She told me she doesn't get his hatred for the name. I told her grandpa did warn her, that he would be in his 90s now and he lived almost 80 years hating the name and thinking of it as an old man's name.

I'd be so furious if I was gramps. Good on the kid for changing his name!", "NTA. Her son is legally able to change his name as he is his own person. Your sister does not have a right to try to prevent that. If for some reason in the future her son doesn't like the name Sky anymore then it is his own responsibility.

NTA your sister is bound and determined to make bad decisions for her kid.", "NTA. Grandpa told her so. She should\u2019ve listened. I wanted to name my daughter after my grandmothers middle names. They both hated both of their names and told me not to stick my child with their awful names. I listened. Glad I did.

We will see how that plays out.", "NTA. You're not saying, 'I told you so', you're defending your nephew's decision and using a real example of someone who didn't do that, and hated his own name. No one should have a name they hate.", "NTA.\n\nYou were right, your grandpa DID warn her not to name her son Arnold. Grandpa hated his name, and now his grandson also hates his name and wants to change it as soon as he turns 18. Who could have guessed, right?!?", "Yeah, you're an asshole. Because your whole premise comes from someone's random hate for random thing will transfer to someone else, just because. YTA", "NTA-One of my sister in laws is named after her grandmother. Grandma told her son and daughter in law not to use her name. She even pointed out that she used her middle name almost exclusively because she hated her first name that much.

Grandma was delighted.", "NTA I know a man who changed his name to cloud who\u2019s in his late 30s and is doing well.

Are you kidding? No that's awful.

It's better than being named some type of made-up, ghetto name imo.\n\nHe was named after his grandpa, which I love. I'm named after a rappers GF from the 80s, who he probably never married. My mom also took her name and added her own spin to it.\n\nOld traditional names > New, fashionable made-up names", "NTA. And ESH concerning the name: it\u2019s a fine name. It\u2019s a shame that your grandfather hated the name so much. Him hating the name influenced everyone else to hate the name.", "Everytime I hear these... Look up dr. Loki skylizard!

Hey Arnold was a cartoon too right?", "NTA\n\nShe was warned just like all the rest of the misguided parents that give their kids names that they'll hate.

The fact that there is a legal remedy for anyone to change their name for a small fee speaks to the reality that some people saddle their kids with crappy names.\n\nReminds me of the time in Walmart that a woman was screaming at her poorly behaved kids, Bandit and Rebel . . .", ":surprised-pikachu-face:", "I like grandpa.", "I don't think OP's goal was to comfort sister. I think it was to get sister to accept the reality of the situation \u2014 which is that her son's opinion isn't changeable.", "Not even because of him, but because of the name itself.", "Eh, sometimes they end up okay with it. Sometimes kids with perfectly reasonable names hate being the 5th Emily in every year of primary. Sometimes kids with hippie names hate that too. Tbh I think it might be kind of a crap shoot... Maybe how you help them navigate those early roots of personal identity has more influence than the actual name(within reason).", "When I think of Arnold, I think of either Hey Arnold or Schwarzenegger.\n\nNeither of those evoke old man to me.", "OP could be using a similar name and not the real one, like Harold would definitely be an old name in my book. \nOr they're in a country where it's more old man name than in mine or yours. \n \nArnold's equivalent here would be Arnaud, which isn't grandpa level but it's not young youg either.", "I think this is probably a cultural thing, I'm guessing this is American as they get a bit funky with their names compared to the UK.\n\nIn the UK \"Sky\" would be a pretty weird name and for me evokes a chavvy (trashy) feeling, like calling a kid Star or Crystal or something that kind of stripper-ish.", "But it wasn't even an \"I told you so.\" \n\nIt was a \"*He* told you how you how it felt to have the name and you ignored it.\"", "Honestly, he can just go by 'Sky', without the expense and hassle of legally changing it. But that's his choice, just like it was his mom's choice to ignore Grandpa's request.", "Just how my grandfather and my nephew feel about it.", "I honestly think we are missing lot's of information. Like why does Arnold hate his name. Kinda feels like family pressure with beeing called nickname all the time.", "As someone in the United States I\u2019ve known men named Cloud, Orion who weren\u2019t bullied for their name and men who were named Skyler and go by Sky who weren\u2019t either. To each their own not everyone\u2019s that judgmental over more unusual names.", "I'm in the US too. Sky is pretty common around where we are. Either as a nickname or a full name.", "Completely agree! Plus older names are in style now. So many names that were old man/old lady names are making the top 50 lists. This just sounds like a teenager being mad about teenager things and it\u2019s really not a big deal.", "Right? Unless OP is using fake names, Arnold is such a normal name in the US at least. It doesn\u2019t even seem like a \u2018grandpa\u2019 name either", "Yes, he has been called Sky for years now.", "The thing is grandpa hated his name too so it's both Arnold's in the family who hated the name.", "I thought the same, then I realized that Mr. Terminator is 75 and Hey Arnold stopped airing in 04'...", ">Arnold's equivalent here would be Arnaud\n\nDutch?", "In the Uk, people are also really weird about androgynous names. One of my friends\u2019 sisters name was Robin and when she became a doctor, she had so many people assume she was the nurse and where was Dr. Robin, *the male authority* to the point where she had to start going by her middle name to avoid the confusion. But also, if it\u2019s good enough for Dominic Cooper in Mama Mia, I think Sky\u2019s probably gonna be fine for the son too..", "He started using Sky when he was like 4 and there was a character he watched with the name. It started being used by his friends and then he asked to be called that so we respected that.", "I know. I said Sky is better than those, despite Sky being horrible itself."]}
