This just sounds like a teenager being mad about teenager things and it\u2019s really not a big deal.", "Right? Unless OP is using fake names, Arnold is such a normal name in the US at least.

Depending on your country you can change it more than once anyway, so other than being a pain to organise it's not a huge deal.\n\n\n\nBut yeh, why honour someone in that way if they tell you they don't approve. Why not ask the grandpa what he would have been wanted to be called, and use that instead. Effectively letting him name his grandson, that's an honour in its own right.", "She could have used Arnold as a middle name to honor grandpa. NAH though, everyone had good intentions here.", "Soft YTA just because \u201cI told you so\u201d is petty and is just salt in the wound. The reality is we only get to choose our children\u2019s birth names, but they get to choose the name they want for adulthood. A lot of people change their names for many reasons, and it can be hard and sad for the parents who put a lot of thought and meaning into the name they chose for their child. Acknowledging her sadness and reminding her that he\u2019s an adult now who can make his own decisions and that this is part of letting him become his own person would have been the kinder, more supportive approach. My child changed her name from the beautiful, meaningful name I gave her to an ugly old man\u2019s name. And honestly I had to grieve a little, but it really helped me when someone reframed it like this for me.", "NTA  \n\n\nArnold warned her that Arnold will be unhappy with being named Arnold.  \nAs Arnold has predicted Arnold didn't like being Arnold.  \nBut the choice of Sky has me think he got his mother's sensitivity in picking a firstname.", "NTA, she could have use Arnold as his middle name.  Would still honour grandpa without saddling the poor kid with a name he would hate.\n\nAnd that could still be a reasonable compromise for your nephew when he does change his name legally at 18, he could make Arnold his middle name so his mother can still feel like your grandpa is being honoured.", "Yta for the \"I told you so,\" which really seems irrelevant to the name change. Whether or not Grandpa liked his name, Arnold is a perfectly normal name. Your sister was allowed to use it if she liked it. Possibly no one else liking it is maybe why a 4 year old had strong feelings on it and wanted to change it, and if that's the case then anyone who bashed his name as a toddler deserves to be ashamed. But, regardless, those feelings have continued for a decade and a half, and now as an adult he can change his name to whatever he wants. Your sister can feel disappointed by this, and it's not \"her fault\" for naming him that. \n\nSo, in summary, kid is not an AH for wanting to change his name, you're not an AH for supporting kid, sister is not an AH for picking a perfectly normal name 18 years ago. You are an AH for acting like the name change is her fault for picking a bad name, which is the point you were asking about, and while she can be disappointed, if she takes that too far instead of realizing her son is an adult and can change his name, that would make her an AH too. But again, not for the initial naming.", "Arnold is a much better name than Sky. But NTA. \n\n\"hi, nice to meet you customer. My name is Sky and I will be handling your account along with my colleagues Falcon, Arya, %, and Frank - who goes by Star because he's really unique\"", "YTA Saying I told you so really IS petty. Actually I think Sky for an adult man is stupid and he never would have chosen it if he wasn't influenced by being called Sky since 4 years old. Neither name is inherently good or bad, it is all subjective. Each person involved in this story likes or dislikes a name based on their own personal experiences. There's nothing inherently right or wrong in the names themselves. Even me saying Sky is stupid, is my OPINION.", "It's actually pretty common for parents to treat their children like possessions instead of people. If she's more interested in the name she choose than about her sons feelings she's pretty selfish.", "She shouldn't have done that, but the son needs to get over it already.  It's not like he has a name that is causing him serious problems.  What, occasionally someone makes a comment?  Not a big enough deal to resent your mom.\n\nYour NTA.  The sister is the AH for not listening to who own grandfather who had first-hand experience with that name, and the son is the AH for putting way too much stock in his name.", "Yeah, that Arnold name, it'll never be a bankable movie star kinda name or anything.  Right?", "NTA but that 18 yo sounds annoying as hell", "As someone with a grandma name with religious affliction even tho I was raised as an atheist, I get why Arnold doesn\u2019t like his name. I\u2019m going down the route of NAH. \n\nI think all three of you have valid points with this whole situation. His mom loves the name and it means a lot to her, of course she doesn\u2019t want him to change his name and even tho grandpa didn\u2019t like his name, the name means something to her. I get your nephews pov but it\u2019s coming off as an almost impulsive thing to do, unless he fully understands that changing your name comes with a lot of paperwork and the new implications of being named Sky. As for you, I don\u2019t really have an opinion one way or another.", "YTA Sister is a good point, as son's new name is going to cause more headaches for him than Arnold ever would a perfectly fine name. It isn't some dated name (sorry in advance to those with these names) like Obadiah, Jebadiah, Murial, or Hezikaiah (Which I personally like because I like old. names).  These are old names.  Grandpa may have hated, but sister liked it.  Isn't that how all baby names are given? Mom and Dad liked it.\n\nYTA Sister as a good point as son's new name is going to cause more headaches for him than Arnold ever would", "YTA, \n\nIdk I think people get too caught up on names. What people like and don't like is so relative unless it's something completely crazy. I have a very common name for my generation and I love it but I have met others who hate it. Arnold sounds fine to me and I agree with your sister that Sky is a bad name. One of those names you can only picture a baby with and not an actual adult.", "So the kid just doesn\u2019t have a middle name? Why can\u2019t he just go by that?? Jeez", "NTA. \n\nShe was warned by a person with this name, she ignored it and now her son has the same attitude to his name as his great-grandfather. \n\nYour sister does have a point about changing it to Sky though, it's doesn't exactly look very professional on a business card and is really as bad as Arnold but for a different reason. \n\nMaybe suggest a compromise, that he finds a name that is close to Sky but doesn't look like his parents were trying to give him a \"unique\" name? That way it would be natural for people who don't know him well to call him Sky but he'd never have to wonder if he didn't get a job or got worse service because people are bigoted against such names.", "NTA. \nThe son doesn't like his name and he has the right to change it. I wouldn't want an old man name either. \nThe mum needs to realise she can't make him keep a name he hates and she needs to (for lack of a better phrase) back off and let him do what he wants.", "NTA - if she loved the name, I would tell her that she should have changed her name into that.", "That\u2019s why you only do family names as middle names. I actually like my middle name and use it more than the one my parents chose. All my kids have my or their mothers grandmothers names but they\u2019re old names that you don\u2019t see anymore. None are bad or anything but how many Geri\u2019s do you know we didn\u2019t use Geraldine because even grams hated it and went by Geri.

Kid can change his name when he turns 18.", "Nta\n\nYour sister lack of awareness is amazing", "NTA\n\nI love my late grandmother\u2019s name. But she hated it. I felt that she would not have seen it as any honor and chose her mother\u2019s name instead and I feel she would have liked that. \n\nIn your sisters case that guesswork wasn\u2019t needed. She knew the risk. \n\nNoll is a nice nickname for an Arnold I know.\n\n^edit didn\u2019t realize he already chose a name til I re-read!", "NTA - Everyone warned her that he would hate the name. Personally, I like the name Arnold. It reminds me of Hey Arnold, but that's just my nostalgia showing.

Also, sister should know that children aren't there for their opinions to be molded by their parents??? And also, Sky is a really nice name so good for him.

Arnold would have made a great middle name. Or update it to something like Arno.

I eventually started to find it funny though because I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d 220lbs with long hair and a beard and I get a kick every now and then when people get caught off guard by it lol.

Second first names are part of your name, but usually not something you are called in everyday life. My godmother did not like her name much, but was ok with me recieving it as a second name. Then, my mom got the \"great\" idea to hypen the two names to create one first name and only call me by that combined name. It would have been a desasterous combination, way too many of the same vowel, too many syllables, etc.. Fake names, but lets say my first name was Maya, my godmothers Amalia. Maya-Amalia, in our local way of speaking, would definately become something like \"Mayamalia\". Thankfully, my mom called her friend, my godmother, with that great idea.

She had a sister named Soledad, which means lonely. My great-grandparents were pretty dark people, I guess?\n\nAnyway, I wanted to name my possible daughter Lola. My husband said that it was a stripper\u2019s name. \ud83e\udd23 \n\nWell, we never had kids, so the name went unused. (But I would have totally named her Lola!)", "And it's always followed up here (Boston) by \"Is she a nun?\"\nAs in, \"I have a sister Mary, and no, she's not a nun\".\nIt's an older generation name, for sure.", "Love me some ice cold Arnie Palmers in the summertime!", "And even more whose middle name is Mary.  I think every Catholic girl had to be given the middle name Mary or Anne in the years between 1940 and 1980.", "Or Marie. My middle name and also one of my sisters, and 3 of my cousins.", "I know about 4 Martha's all between 35 and 45 now. Maybe it's because the one I knew the best was super popular in school and friendly to everyone, but I had Martha on the short list of names for my daughter a few years back.", "Marie is definitely the more common Catholic middle name where I am. About 1/3 of the girls in my Catholic elementary school class had the middle name of Marie, including myself. I don't know any that had Mary. The rest of the middle names were either Rose or Elizabeth. Additionally, my mom, all my aunts, my grandma, and most of my great-grandmothers also have/had the middle name of Marie. My other grandmother has Mary as a first name and one of my great-grandmothers was Maria. \n\nI do however have multiple friends with the first name of Mary who are around my age (30). Weirdly none are Catholic, most come from Southern Baptist backgrounds.", "I think it really depends. Acquaintances and general friends: Yeah, they'll probably say they like it to my face. Close friends and family: Nah, they'll definitely say to me that it looks dumb as fuck. If I can't expect honesty from those people (and a bit of ribbing for my poor decisions), then I'm not going to them with anything important. Partners on the other hand, I'd probably say go with a more non-committal answer. Though to be fair, my partners have never asked me that question and I've never asked them it either.", "I'm in Canada - and I know more than one man named Skyler ; I'd dare you to make fun of any of them..", "I'm a woman named Skye, I've literally ONLY met men named Skye, and my namesake was even a man lol", "Well I am Ruby Wednesday with a cousin named Mabel Lydia.... I don't think these are old fashioned names....", "As long as it isn't spelled Rwby.", "If you are going to do that, why not make mary the middle name?", "It makes me think of Agatha Trunchbull from Matilda.", "i bet that\u2019s it"]}
