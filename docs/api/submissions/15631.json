Grandpa told her not to saddle her son with an old man name and told her to go find something nicer, even if it wasn't an honor for him, because in 78 years he never loved his name and he'd hate to be blamed for another generation being saddled with it. She was upset. He died before her son was born and she chose to name her son Arnold anyway, saying grandpa was just old and sick and didn't realize how lovely his name is.\n\nNow her son is 17 and will be 18 soon and he despises his first name. It became an even bigger deal to him when he learned the man he was named after also hated his name (another one of our siblings told him when he was complaining about his mom's complaints about him hating his name). He was like why the fuck did you name me after someone who hated their own damn name. My sister tried to lie and say he never hated his name. But my nephew knew the truth already. He told her he had a grandpa name and he hated it, that the name was ugly and not something he wanted to live with for the rest of his life and as soon as he is 18 he will be filing to change his name to the nickname he has used his whole life (not actually his whole life but he was like 4 when he got his nickname).\n\nMy sister was crying to me about it. I comforted her. She told me she needed to find a way to change his mind or he'd regret it forever when he realizes being Sky as an adult man will not get him very far and he will see that it's not a real name or something a grown man should need to use on everything. I told her she can't change how he feels about it though. She told me she doesn't get his hatred for the name. I told her grandpa did warn her, that he would be in his 90s now and he lived almost 80 years hating the name and thinking of it as an old man's name. She told me that wasn't fair and saying I told you so is pretty.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682417281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yevni/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_grandpa_warned_her/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
