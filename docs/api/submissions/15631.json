This just sounds like a teenager being mad about teenager things and it\u2019s really not a big deal.", "Right? Unless OP is using fake names, Arnold is such a normal name in the US at least.

Depending on your country you can change it more than once anyway, so other than being a pain to organise it's not a huge deal.\n\n\n\nBut yeh, why honour someone in that way if they tell you they don't approve. Why not ask the grandpa what he would have been wanted to be called, and use that instead. Effectively letting him name his grandson, that's an honour in its own right.", "She could have used Arnold as a middle name to honor grandpa. NAH though, everyone had good intentions here.", "Soft YTA just because \u201cI told you so\u201d is petty and is just salt in the wound. The reality is we only get to choose our children\u2019s birth names, but they get to choose the name they want for adulthood. A lot of people change their names for many reasons, and it can be hard and sad for the parents who put a lot of thought and meaning into the name they chose for their child. Acknowledging her sadness and reminding her that he\u2019s an adult now who can make his own decisions and that this is part of letting him become his own person would have been the kinder, more supportive approach. My child changed her name from the beautiful, meaningful name I gave her to an ugly old man\u2019s name. And honestly I had to grieve a little, but it really helped me when someone reframed it like this for me.", "NTA  \n\n\nArnold warned her that Arnold will be unhappy with being named Arnold.  \nAs Arnold has predicted Arnold didn't like being Arnold.  \nBut the choice of Sky has me think he got his mother's sensitivity in picking a firstname.", "NTA, she could have use Arnold as his middle name.  Would still honour grandpa without saddling the poor kid with a name he would hate.\n\nAnd that could still be a reasonable compromise for your nephew when he does change his name legally at 18, he could make Arnold his middle name so his mother can still feel like your grandpa is being honoured.", "Yta for the \"I told you so,\" which really seems irrelevant to the name change. Whether or not Grandpa liked his name, Arnold is a perfectly normal name. Your sister was allowed to use it if she liked it. Possibly no one else liking it is maybe why a 4 year old had strong feelings on it and wanted to change it, and if that's the case then anyone who bashed his name as a toddler deserves to be ashamed. But, regardless, those feelings have continued for a decade and a half, and now as an adult he can change his name to whatever he wants. Your sister can feel disappointed by this, and it's not \"her fault\" for naming him that. \n\nSo, in summary, kid is not an AH for wanting to change his name, you're not an AH for supporting kid, sister is not an AH for picking a perfectly normal name 18 years ago. You are an AH for acting like the name change is her fault for picking a bad name, which is the point you were asking about, and while she can be disappointed, if she takes that too far instead of realizing her son is an adult and can change his name, that would make her an AH too. But again, not for the initial naming.", "Arnold is a much better name than Sky. But NTA. \n\n\"hi, nice to meet you customer. My name is Sky and I will be handling your account along with my colleagues Falcon, Arya, %, and Frank - who goes by Star because he's really unique\"", "YTA Saying I told you so really IS petty. Actually I think Sky for an adult man is stupid and he never would have chosen it if he wasn't influenced by being called Sky since 4 years old. Neither name is inherently good or bad, it is all subjective. Each person involved in this story likes or dislikes a name based on their own personal experiences. There's nothing inherently right or wrong in the names themselves. Even me saying Sky is stupid, is my OPINION.", "It's actually pretty common for parents to treat their children like possessions instead of people. If she's more interested in the name she choose than about her sons feelings she's pretty selfish.", "She shouldn't have done that, but the son needs to get over it already.  It's not like he has a name that is causing him serious problems.  What, occasionally someone makes a comment?  Not a big enough deal to resent your mom.\n\nYour NTA.  The sister is the AH for not listening to who own grandfather who had first-hand experience with that name, and the son is the AH for putting way too much stock in his name.", "Yeah, that Arnold name, it'll never be a bankable movie star kinda name or anything.  Right?", "NTA but that 18 yo sounds annoying as hell", "As someone with a grandma name with religious affliction even tho I was raised as an atheist, I get why Arnold doesn\u2019t like his name. I\u2019m going down the route of NAH. \n\nI think all three of you have valid points with this whole situation. His mom loves the name and it means a lot to her, of course she doesn\u2019t want him to change his name and even tho grandpa didn\u2019t like his name, the name means something to her. I get your nephews pov but it\u2019s coming off as an almost impulsive thing to do, unless he fully understands that changing your name comes with a lot of paperwork and the new implications of being named Sky. As for you, I don\u2019t really have an opinion one way or another.", "YTA Sister is a good point, as son's new name is going to cause more headaches for him than Arnold ever would a perfectly fine name. It isn't some dated name (sorry in advance to those with these names) like Obadiah, Jebadiah, Murial, or Hezikaiah (Which I personally like because I like old. names).  These are old names.  Grandpa may have hated, but sister liked it.  Isn't that how all baby names are given? Mom and Dad liked it.\n\nYTA Sister as a good point as son's new name is going to cause more headaches for him than Arnold ever would", "YTA, \n\nIdk I think people get too caught up on names. What people like and don't like is so relative unless it's something completely crazy. I have a very common name for my generation and I love it but I have met others who hate it. Arnold sounds fine to me and I agree with your sister that Sky is a bad name. One of those names you can only picture a baby with and not an actual adult.", "So the kid just doesn\u2019t have a middle name? Why can\u2019t he just go by that?? Jeez", "NTA. \n\nShe was warned by a person with this name, she ignored it and now her son has the same attitude to his name as his great-grandfather. \n\nYour sister does have a point about changing it to Sky though, it's doesn't exactly look very professional on a business card and is really as bad as Arnold but for a different reason. \n\nMaybe suggest a compromise, that he finds a name that is close to Sky but doesn't look like his parents were trying to give him a \"unique\" name? That way it would be natural for people who don't know him well to call him Sky but he'd never have to wonder if he didn't get a job or got worse service because people are bigoted against such names.", "NTA. \nThe son doesn't like his name and he has the right to change it. I wouldn't want an old man name either. \nThe mum needs to realise she can't make him keep a name he hates and she needs to (for lack of a better phrase) back off and let him do what he wants.", "NTA - if she loved the name, I would tell her that she should have changed her name into that.", "That\u2019s why you only do family names as middle names. I actually like my middle name and use it more than the one my parents chose. All my kids have my or their mothers grandmothers names but they\u2019re old names that you don\u2019t see anymore. None are bad or anything but how many Geri\u2019s do you know we didn\u2019t use Geraldine because even grams hated it and went by Geri.

Kid can change his name when he turns 18.", "Nta\n\nYour sister lack of awareness is amazing", "NTA\n\nI love my late grandmother\u2019s name. But she hated it. I felt that she would not have seen it as any honor and chose her mother\u2019s name instead and I feel she would have liked that. \n\nIn your sisters case that guesswork wasn\u2019t needed. She knew the risk. \n\nNoll is a nice nickname for an Arnold I know.\n\n^edit didn\u2019t realize he already chose a name til I re-read!", "NTA - Everyone warned her that he would hate the name. Personally, I like the name Arnold. It reminds me of Hey Arnold, but that's just my nostalgia showing.

Also, sister should know that children aren't there for their opinions to be molded by their parents??? And also, Sky is a really nice name so good for him.

Arnold would have made a great middle name. Or update it to something like Arno.

I eventually started to find it funny though because I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d 220lbs with long hair and a beard and I get a kick every now and then when people get caught off guard by it lol.

Second first names are part of your name, but usually not something you are called in everyday life. My godmother did not like her name much, but was ok with me recieving it as a second name. Then, my mom got the \"great\" idea to hypen the two names to create one first name and only call me by that combined name. It would have been a desasterous combination, way too many of the same vowel, too many syllables, etc.. Fake names, but lets say my first name was Maya, my godmothers Amalia. Maya-Amalia, in our local way of speaking, would definately become something like \"Mayamalia\". Thankfully, my mom called her friend, my godmother, with that great idea.

It's weird to me too but people have different tastes. I always try to respect that.", "Well, I\u2019m here to tell you that taste in shitty names is apparently genetic in your family.\n\nAnd if I had a baby in front of me and HAD to pick between \u201cArnold\u201d and \u201cSky\u201d\u2026Arnold would win by a mile.\n\nYour sister isn\u2019t wrong that your son\u2019s choice IS going to cost him professionally as well as in other avenues.\n\nBut picking Arnold was very very ill advised on her part, given the feedback she had from the original bearer.", "I think Arnold is one of those names that if you like it you really like it, but if you don't then you really really don't.", "Regardless of the issue with your Grandpa not having liked the name, it seems like your nephew not liking the name your sister picked for him is something she's just going to have to learn to accept, because the more she fights against it the bigger the rift she's going to cause with her son. \n\nIt's probably better that he does it ASAP so that even if it turns out she's right about how having the name Sky as an adult might cause issues, he could change it to something else before becoming too entrenched in his career, etc. Plus, if she DOES manage to convince him to keep the name he hates, he'd probably end up building resentment over it and having a bigger argument about it later on.", "The pink pup on Paw Patrol? :D", "That's so strange, I think of Robin as being primarily a woman's name.", "It's not the most typical name but I'm co-workers with someone with that name and no one blinks twice at it. It's hardly groundbreaking in this day and age.", "My godson actually has an Arnold in his class and he just turned 6!", "His friends do call him Sky and have for many years now.

Ultimately he is the one who has to live with his name.", "My sister doesn't believe in fall back options.", "All that matters is that the nephew himself likes the name", "I know a lot of people around my age (mid 20s to mid 30s) named Mary. I don\u2019t think it sounds like an old lady name lol. Edith, Mable, or Ruby maybe do though", "Lol I actually think Mary is classic. I used to work with a Mary who\u2019s in her 20\u2019s and she is amazing. She\u2019s gorgeous inside and out and I will always associate the name Mary with her now.", "In my country Mary is/was a very common name, followed by a second one that was actually used. For example, Mar\u00eda Laura, everybody calls her Laura, and so on. It was done mostly for religious reasons, but thankfully this custom is disappearing.\n\nAlso, it's a common saying among politicians when speaking about something is \"Para que entienda do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda\" (So Mrs. Mary understands) meaning they are dumbing down some complex issue.", "Mary was traditional name of the first daughter in a Catholic family. Or a variation, Marie, Maria. It was in honor of Jesus' mother Mary. My sister's name was Mary.", "That's not my first name, that is a username with part of my second name and both my surnames. In my country the usual is you get two names and two surnames.", "That is certainly a common thing jerks say to themselves before they upset someone.

That's like a 40 year old woman being upset that her name is Jessica or Kimberley.", "That's fine. Not everyone will have the same taste in names.", "LMAO, it absolutely will not cost him professionally.  Sky is downright ordinary compared to half the Gen Z names out there.  Literally no one is going to care about his name when it comes to employment.", "That was my first thought but if he started using it when he was 4 and is now 17.. Paw Patrol isn't that old. Although it's older than I thought (apparently came out in 2013?!).", "Can be used for either men or women but is definitely more of a man's name in the UK. It's more of an old man name though.", "So what? I dislike my middle name for me, so I just don't use it or shorten it to an initial.  Heck, for my first name I primarily go by the nickname of my name.  I still don't have a fit about it.", "Well\u2026 she\u2019ll have to reap the rewards of it then", "I don't hear just Mary around here for people under 50, unless it's like a double name.

As everyone else said, grandpa told her!", "Where does a name like Pearl fall on the list?", "According to my husband, naming girls Mary, but calling them by their middle name is common in Irish-American families. It was very common here decades ago, which is why almost everyone has a grandma, aunt or other older relative named Mary.", "This is common in parts of French Canada, too. I did a language exchange to a very tiny town in Quebec, and out of 14 teachers, 8 were Marie or Mary - something. 3 had the exact same name, Marie H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Many of them do say the Marie as part of their name, though. And it's also a religious custom.", "Awesome. It's not a book anyone I know has read, except for myself.

Some people in this thread think Sky is weird or stupid when I've known multiple Sky, Skye, Skylar and it's just a \"regular\" name to people in my age group.", "I think it just shows how different people associate names. For some a name will be weird and others will find it pretty, some will find a name boring while others will find it lovely. Some will think a name sounds old and others will say it sounds more fresh.

Tbh I like old fashioned names though; I have a parakeet named Opaline and dream of naming a daughter Adelaide one day", "It\u2019s a catholic thing.", "Haha no worries. It's an old favourite of mine, bleak as it is. I love the writer for trying to see the woman's point of view, even as a Victorian.\n\nI'm pretty sure others know it too, though.
