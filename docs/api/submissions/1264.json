Your time is just as valuable as an adults. You\u2019re not being manipulative you\u2019re setting boundaries. That\u2019s way different. Being manipulative would be you threatening to call CPS every time you don\u2019t get something you want if it\u2019s not a necessity. And not only are you earning money, you are experiencing taking care of kids so you will actually have a much better idea of what being a parent is then kids that grow up never having the chance to take care of a child. It won\u2019t give you the complete experience of being a parent of course. This will also help you decide if being a parent is something you truly want. But you definitely should be getting paid for it no matter who your babysitting for.", "NTA enjoy your time with Dad and step Mom", "NTA you go get em kid you sound like you have a good head on your shoulders get that money and don't feel bad about it at all.", "NTA and if I were a parent I wouldn't want to leave my kids with a hostile sitter.

Your mom sounds like a piece of work.

Mom's using OP for clout and seems to think she has full power over their time and money, all very narc behavior.\n\nWhen mom does that I'd be making promises on mom to the same people \"Mrs. Smith said she loves your peach cobbler so I told her you'd make some for her husband's birthday.\" \n\nSee how she likes it.", "Why only a few weeks?", "Also I want to add, babysitting IS a real job. I\u2019m a parent of 2 young kids and being a parent is the absolute hardest job I\u2019ve ever had. Caring for children is no joke. We\u2019ve had many babysitters and nannies over the years and always pay very fairly. Only time we don\u2019t pay for childcare is when it\u2019s grandparents (and we only see them like 1x a year) or if we trade childcare with a friend or ask a neighbor for a favor for a couple of hours, and then buy them a gift afterwards. We even had a neighbor\u2019s younger relatives offer to dog sit for us for free, and we still paid them really well.", "My mum had a slightly similar outlook, in that if I did sthg for a family friend, she'd encourage me to offer it for free. However, it was always up to me, she would never speak directly to her friend about freebies or indicate it was free labour when setting it up.", "My narc mum did this by offering for me to go fix peoples computers.  For free.", "maybe stop diagnosing people online.", "Yes, that was the *implication.*", "Hey you gotta get that bag you ain't gonna do it for free no matter who it is NTA", "NTA but don't \"threaten\" to move, that never ends well.

And as soon as you legally can move to your Dad's place.\n\n\\*\\*Those plans can be super vague like, oh, I have a school thing.", "NTA\nMove in with your dad.", "NTA... Your mother can make you help out with normal chores in her own house, if you live there... \n\nNo parent can lend out their kid to do chores/babysit/rake leaves or whatever for other people.\n\nYou are not blackmailing her, you are protective of wasting your time and efforts for naught!", "How are you the manipulative one here when your mom is literally saying that because you live under her roof you are equivocally an indentured servant required to do her bidding if she needs you to. NTA. Wow that\u2019s just insane.", "NTA. Easy. Your mom has a very funny idea of how the world works. Your pay should match your work ethic, and if you\u2019re being lied to about when you get to go home, there\u2019s absolutely no reason for you to not get paid extra, much less for FREE as a \u201cfavor\u201d because they happen to be friends with your mom.", "NTA. Wise beyond your years.", "If you possess such a stiff and resilient spine at the age of fifteen, I imagine the future is looking pretty good for you. \n\nStanding up to parents and family, especially at fifteen years of age, is a very hard thing to do.

Your mother is manipulative for saying things she has. No child under 18 owes their parents any money. You don't owe your mother any money. Yet she IS taking money from you by trading your work for popularity points from her friends, instead of giving you the reward for your work. \n\nYou asking money up front makes sense, and is NOT entitlement.  Your mother doesn't get to \"loan you\" to her friends and neighbours like you were an object.... Though I would start to worry your mother will take money from your account as revenge, if she has access. Keep that in mind, and open an account with your father, to reduce the risk.\n\nIf your father is fine with you staying with him, then I would take this as an opportunity to get away from your mother. She is using manipulation tactics as parenting tools, and that is not good for you. \n\nKnowing the value of your work isn't selfish, it's a required life skill. YOU get to choose who you like enough, to give a free favour every now and then. If you want to donate your work to someone, that is ALWAYS YOUR choice.

You and your brother both move in with your dad. The custody agreement changes and he starts getting child support from your mom for you and your brother.

No, babysitting clients usually aren't asked to pay up front, but the reason for that is because they actually pay when the job is done. OP's mom is interfering and telling her friends to not pay her because it's a favor. OP circumvents that by getting paid at the start, so there's no opportunity for her mom to butt in and mess up her money train.  And it's not a **minor** squabble. OP's mom won't let her get an actual job at a brick and mortar store, so she babysits to make money. Her mom also won't let her make money from babysitting, so basically her mom is telling her to be broke and cry about it. Are you the mom? You're the mom aren't you? HEY GUYS, I FOUND THE MOM!!!!", "OP you are not \"acting entitled\" by demanding payment up front for labor.\n\nYou are not manipulative for refusing to live with a controlling and manipulative mother. \n\nGo live your best life with your dad.

Especially when it's her own mother?\n\nBTW I'm the one who got you to 69 downvotes.", "OP every aspect of every relationship happens at the intersection of 2 people's boundaries. If you're not both cool with something, that aspect of that relationship doesn't happen.\n\nYou are NOT manipulative if your mother spends your time and labor on your behalf, and you refuse to live with her under those circumstances. That's called having boundaries, and you are 100% in the right for that.", "NTA - I have 2 kids and I encouraged them the find jobs and bill their clients (includes my friends) appropriately for the work rendered. I don\u2019t get involved in the deal at all as they have to learn to advocate for themselves and understand what is fair. I only provide advice for how to formalize communications (templates for invoicing and taxes). Sometimes I read their texts if they want me to wordsmith for them. \n\nIn the flip side, I employ my friends kids for work as well and I pay fair wages and we all agree on terms.

If it were an emergency, maybe, I'd be OK with a kid being dragooned into helping, but I'd make sure to make it up to the kid with money. I used to babysit as a teen and I remember what it was like to have people assume your time isn't important.  Hell, some years ago we had an emergency and my daughter went to a friend's house all day and totally on her own, because she's a nice person, the teenage daughter of the family went out of her way to distract my kid and I gave her $50 on the sly for being helpful.", "NTA as you said SHE is volunteering YOUR time WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION and that make her TA !\n\ngo live with your father full time, you'll be way happier in a house where you're valued and not used !", "NTA\n\nThat's how jobs and money work.
