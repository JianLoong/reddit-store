She never uses it, but she also doesn't usually say anything about other people using it either. So I was surprised when she told me she didn't want my sister to use it for our wedding and asked me to convey the message. My sister always uses skin brightening cream for any big event, especially if she will be photographed. So I know she is planning on doing so for our wedding.\n\nMy fiancee said she hates skin brightening cream and doesn't want the use of it immortalized in our wedding photos. She said my sister should understand because this is a small family event and the photos will only be seen by us and our close family. She said it's not unusual for brides to have requests about the look of the wedding party. She would know better than me, so I agreed.\n\nAsking my sister didn't go over well. My sister was furious and said I have no say over her skincare routine. She said she will use whatever products she wants, and if my fiancee has a problem with that she can uninvite her. My fiancee said fine, but then my sister won't be a part of the wedding party or in the photos. My mom and sister are furious about this decision and don't want to work with me at all, telling me to get my wife under control, because she's being ridiculous.\n\nI would think my sister would want to make us happy on our special day and be willing to compromise, but did I ask for too much?\n\nEdit: After talking to my fiancee we've decided to just uninvite my sister. Her beliefs are her own and not really any of our business, but why would we want someone who thinks women who look like my fiancee are ugly to be at our wedding? It just doesn't make sense. I always saw it as a personal choice, but it's more than that. My sister is saying to the world that she thinks brown women are ugly, and while that's sad for her, because she is one, it isn't my fiancee's problem to deal with. So we just won't have her there. No one should have to be told on their wedding day that they are ugly.\n\nClarification: several people have asked me to explain in the post itself what skin brightening cream does, since a lot of commentors are white and don't know. The cream changes your skin so that you look fair, more like a white person than a brown one. It isn't makeup. It fades over time, so you need to keep applying it, and it can make you sick. The reason my fiancee hates it is because she has seen it give friends and relatives skin conditions and other illnesses and because women who use it say women who don't are ugly. My fiancee thinks we should be proud of our brown skin, because our race has accomplished many things. That is why she didn't want its obvious use in our photos. Several people have told me the proper name is skin lightening cream, but in our community we call it skin brightening cream. Apparently white people have a different product also called that which is different.

Sister is a victim of racism, but sister is also participating in perpetuating a beauty trend that is harmful to people, especially women, of colour. This isn't a case of \"I don't like brightening cream and I don't want to see it at my wedding\", this is a case of \"brightening cream exists because of racism and racist beauty ideals, people that I love dearly have suffered emotionally and physically because of it, and I don't want a reminder of that at my wedding\".", "So lets say a person wears white every single day. It's their favorite color. Would a bride be considered the asshole for asking them not to wear white on their wedding day?", "So should a beautiful sister of a groom have to wear a mask to cover her face if he marries an ugly woman? Should a woman with a great body have to wear some badly fitting dress to make up for it if her brother marries an obese woman?", "Well, that's why I said NAH. I don't think his sister is being unreasonable by playing into the system she's been told is right and good. I just also don't think it's unreasonable to want to reject that system on your wedding day if it directly affects you.", "Just because they make his sister feel confident doesn't mean his wife has to deal with it at her wedding. A lot of people are comparing it to dieting or tanning in the US, but colourism in many countries is a big part of their caste system. It's more akin to asking someone to cover up their Confederate flag tattoo at a wedding and uninviting them if they don't. It's not exactly that BC I don't think his sister is an AH for trying to take advantage of whatever she can, but his wife is also not for rejecting something that disparages her skin tone.", "It\u2019s not really the same thing though. There\u2019s not a lot of racial baggage wrapped up in tanning, and people don\u2019t feel social pressure to tan their skin to be considered acceptable or to be more likely to be hired for jobs.\n\nI\u2019m trying to think of a good alternative comparison\u2026\n\nMaybe relaxing black hair and the bride saying she wants her sister to wear her hair naturally for the wedding?", "Exactly. This is about being a bridezilla. It doesn\u2019t matter what the controversial product is. \n\nDiets are controversial. You don\u2019t ban your bridesmaids from dieting.", "If the country has a caste system partly based on colourism then participating in that caste system does impact her, even if not directly. It's not the same as not being able to eat cake.", "Would you also think the bride would be an asshole to uninvite the bridesmaid in question?", "and it's her wedding. She has all right to uninvite who she doesn't want there and even her husband has no issue not inviting his sister", "It's the colorism for me, All shades of brown are beautiful.  But if the SIL is so insecure with her shade she shouldn't be forced to comply with the wedding request of the bride and groom who are validating her beauty by saying lightening her skin is unnecessary. This issue is steeped in Soo much pain it's hard to decide which way to fall on this one. I say move in Love. Love is kind, love is Patient, love is long-suffering, love doesn't boast, love is not provoked, love does not seek it's own way, love takes no account of evil, love doesn't envy, ... Walk in love", "Um no, that's obviously not colourism. Colourism is when people are treated as lesser because of their skin colour. I'm from the US and that's not really the case with tanning there.", "That\u2019s somehow different because \u201creasons.\u201d", "It changes the appearance of the photos in that it\u2019s purposefully making the sister look more white than her natural skin color- which would be a personal preference if not for the histories of colorism, classicism, and racism that exist in communities who use the creams. So if she\u2019s trying \u201cto look her best\u201d for photos and that involves looking whiter/different skin color than the bride, the bride could get a little understandably miffed about that.", "I feel like there\u2019s a difference between the bride\u2019s request affecting *only* the wedding day vs the bride\u2019s request affecting the entire month or whatever. So dictating the dress/makeup/hairstyle is ok (to me at least) because it\u2019s just for the wedding. Cutting/coloring the hair, changes to skincare etc is not.\n\nIt\u2019s a wedding day, not a wedding week/month/year.", "Ok, asking someone to stop doing something for a month seems excessive.  (Though to be fair I don't fully understand what the process is or what it entails).  But still, a month?", "your main argument was about racist and colonial standards, which is true for some parts of the world, but not all, and not all directly. Hence me taking issue with your simplification of it.", "I had no idea this was a thing. I\u2019ve always loved the beautiful bright colours used in Indian clothing & thought they looked great next to brown skin. I can rarely wear bright colours cause I\u2019m so pale & they don\u2019t look good on me.", "But fair and lovely does jack shit. Unless his sis is using some magical solution to make herself look white, I don't think anyone would even know she applied something on her face.", "I'm so sorry you went through this. My friend was pressured into using them by family as a teenager and it's genuinely scary to think of the damage that could've been caused.", "I'm mostly of Italian, German, and French decent. I tan very very easily, but don't enjoy the sun. As a child, my father would hate how pale I was when I showed up for his custody time and just plop me in the sun to darken me up. To this day, I hate tanning, hate sunning, and use mega sunscreen when in the sun. \n\nBeing told your skin color is unattractive hurts. Especially by close family.", "Yeah, I replied before the edit! Thanks for clarifying!", "Needs upvotes. Thank you for saying this! I\u2019m surprised more people haven\u2019t pointed this out. Colorism is a classist practice that is not based in colonialism/racism per se. For example, pre-colonial (I.e., white) Europeans preferred light skin and criticized those with tans, since they usually had been outdoors farming or laboring. It was about material privilege. (Not saying racism doesn\u2019t exist, BTW)", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s still super shitty and I LOVE your username.", "I'm Indian too, living in india, with darker skin and i completely disagree with your POV. OP has stated their sister says dark skin is ugly, and his fiance has dark skin. So yeah, the sister is partaking in racism/colorism. If someone constantly spouts that they think dark skin is ugly, I wouldn't want them at my wedding. If the sister has every right to wear the cream, op's fiance has every right to uninvite her from the wedding. Victims of oppression often perpetuate it too.", "You are either not dark skinned or not from the region where being dark skinned is discriminated against. According to OP, his fiance and sister are brown and his sister dislikes that the fiance is dark skinned. This is an issue of colorism and she has every right to not invite someone who actively pursue colorism. We need to call this shit out eve chance we get.", "True that. It just seems like in general, redditors are really good at reading between the lines (sometimes overzealously so) when something seems amiss. You would think such an adverse reaction to supposed skincare might raise the same flags, but that's just me.", "Yeah, this is a really complex and fraught issue. And I think it goes deeper than a lot of people realize- I have a serum I really like, so I decided to try the rest of the line. But one of the reasons I like the serum is that it\u2019s supposed to help with uneven skin tone. Great! I have the kind of Irish heritage that means I freckle a lot and get blotchily pink from high emotion. Then I read the rest of the boxes and realize in dawning horror that the vitamin c is effective on the freckles because it\u2019s about stopping new pigmentation, and the whole line is just expensive stealth fairness products. Not quite bleaching, but definitely there to stop literally any new pigmentation, and I\u2019ve accidentally been participating in one of the most fucked up colonialist and damaging aspects of the beauty industry in the world. \n\nSo I think asking SIL to change her routine is iffy, but not inviting her or excluding her from all photos is incredibly reasonable", "I don't think that's a good comparison. Whiteness being considered more beautiful is rooted deeply in racism. Asking someone to not participate in that for one event is not in the same realm of any of your examples", "The problem is that she is disparaging someone else's choices in the process. So if the bride decides that to be in the wedding, you have to use skin brightening cream, that would be okay? What if the bride said that bridesmaids have to use heavy makeup? They can only weigh a certain weight? It's not her business. Any of it. The brother bringing up the health issue is a red herring. They are free to disinvite his sister over her skin care routine. She's free to never speak to them again. This is going to damage the relationship with your sister unnecessarily. YTA - your fiance is a huge one.", "> It's more akin to asking someone to cover up their Confederate flag tattoo\n\nIs it?   It sounds like covering up an objectionable tattoo would keep anyone from seeing it, but taking a day off from skin brightener wouldn't change sister's appearance much if at all?", "The bride wants sister to take **a month** off her routine so her skin would get darker. It really isn't comparable to \"just put on a shirt with long sleeves for a couple of hours\"", "So if his fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t like that his sister had a large boob job or had colored her hair some other color should they disinvite the sister for that? \n\nThe idea that the sister wanting to change things about herself is \u201cdisparaging\u201d the fianc\u00e9e is ridiculous. She can change whatever she wants about herself.", "Woah, comparing someone's feelings regarding their own skin color is nowhere near the same as having them cover up a confederate tattoo. Instead, it would be like having your friend cover up their vitiligo. Some people don't, some people do, some people consider those who do as being ashamed and negatively impacting everyone with the condition. It's not okay to tell someone else how they must treat their own body.", "A controversial diet is not the same as a caste system.", "Yes. Especially bc it is her future family!!!\n\nI can\u2019t imagine thinking you get to control your bridesmaid\u2019s skin.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t even want to be a bridesmaid for a bridezilla like that.", "What this bride is doing is STILL contributing to colorism. She is telling another adult what they\u2019re allowed to do with their own skin. \n\n\u201cAll shades of brown are beautiful,\u201d this should include light brown too, if that\u2019s what the SIL wants her OWN FACE to look like.\n\nLove doesn\u2019t CONTROL and manipulate.", "I'm mostly over it. It was more ignorance than malice on my family's part. I really appreciate your compassion though. \u2764\ufe0f", "If the sister is regularly stating that the bride is ugly, that should be the reason she\u2019s uninvited. Full stop. If everyone is assuming she thinks the bride\u2019s ugly because she used this product, that\u2019s entirely different. But then the focus shouldn\u2019t be on the cream. The focus should be on what the sister says about the fianc\u00e9. So I find it confusing that OP is coming on here saying they\u2019re going to uninvite her because of her use of the cream if it\u2019s really because of the things the sister says about the fianc\u00e9. It seems like they\u2019re using the cream as some sort of scape goat to not just say \u201cwe don\u2019t want to invite her because she\u2019s rude to fianc\u00e9\u201d.", "I hadn\u2019t come across OP\u2019s comment that said so before. If the sister is voicing such comments, then she is a perpetrator and deserves to be uninvited for being uncivil to the bride.", "You have to have the foundational context to be able to read between lines.", "It\u2019s a caste system for fat people. It\u2019s a very similar issue."]}
