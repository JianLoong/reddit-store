She never uses it, but she also doesn't usually say anything about other people using it either. So I was surprised when she told me she didn't want my sister to use it for our wedding and asked me to convey the message. My sister always uses skin brightening cream for any big event, especially if she will be photographed. So I know she is planning on doing so for our wedding.\n\nMy fiancee said she hates skin brightening cream and doesn't want the use of it immortalized in our wedding photos. She said my sister should understand because this is a small family event and the photos will only be seen by us and our close family. She said it's not unusual for brides to have requests about the look of the wedding party. She would know better than me, so I agreed.\n\nAsking my sister didn't go over well. My sister was furious and said I have no say over her skincare routine. She said she will use whatever products she wants, and if my fiancee has a problem with that she can uninvite her. My fiancee said fine, but then my sister won't be a part of the wedding party or in the photos. My mom and sister are furious about this decision and don't want to work with me at all, telling me to get my wife under control, because she's being ridiculous.\n\nI would think my sister would want to make us happy on our special day and be willing to compromise, but did I ask for too much?\n\nEdit: After talking to my fiancee we've decided to just uninvite my sister. Her beliefs are her own and not really any of our business, but why would we want someone who thinks women who look like my fiancee are ugly to be at our wedding? It just doesn't make sense. I always saw it as a personal choice, but it's more than that. My sister is saying to the world that she thinks brown women are ugly, and while that's sad for her, because she is one, it isn't my fiancee's problem to deal with. So we just won't have her there. No one should have to be told on their wedding day that they are ugly.\n\nClarification: several people have asked me to explain in the post itself what skin brightening cream does, since a lot of commentors are white and don't know. The cream changes your skin so that you look fair, more like a white person than a brown one. It isn't makeup. It fades over time, so you need to keep applying it, and it can make you sick. The reason my fiancee hates it is because she has seen it give friends and relatives skin conditions and other illnesses and because women who use it say women who don't are ugly. My fiancee thinks we should be proud of our brown skin, because our race has accomplished many things. That is why she didn't want its obvious use in our photos. Several people have told me the proper name is skin lightening cream, but in our community we call it skin brightening cream. Apparently white people have a different product also called that which is different.

I'm sure that is why the bride objects to her future SIL wearing the cream although I don't think one day without it will make much difference.  This might be the bride's way of making a statement to the SIL about how she feels about these products,  not that she believes it will make a difference to her skin appearance at the wedding unless she is using a lighter foundation as well.

I found this terribly intrusive on the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s part because this is (sadly) such a rudimentary part in the life of an Indian woman that I assure you that half the women in this wedding will be wearing the same brand of cream and you won\u2019t even know.\n\nThis is one of those stories which is facing an out-of-touch judgement from Reddit because of reddit\u2019s inherently more reactionary nature and the euro-centric view of racism as a concept.", "It\u2019s hard to know you\u2019re missing any piece of the puzzle when you have no idea there\u2019s a piece missing. \n\nA lot of white people have absolutely no concept of how colorism is enacted because they have never seen it nor the products that exist because of it. They hear \u201cskin brightening\u201d and think vitamin C instead of hydroquinone.", "No, it sounds like the fiance is not comfortable with someone who dislikes dark skin enough to chemically change it. As someone with darker skin myself, i understand how she feels. If SIL can wear whatever she wants, isn't op's fiance allowed to invite who they want for their wedding?", "I'm not leaving a judgement because I have mixed feelings, but I really disagree with this line of thought. It's not fair to compare racism to things like hairstyles, tattoos, or even scars. Sister is a victim of racism, but sister is also participating in perpetuating a beauty trend that is harmful to people, especially women, of colour. This isn't a case of \"I don't like brightening cream and I don't want to see it at my wedding\", this is a case of \"brightening cream exists because of racism and racist beauty ideals, people that I love dearly have suffered emotionally and physically because of it, and I don't want a reminder of that at my wedding\".", "So lets say a person wears white every single day.

Should a woman with a great body have to wear some badly fitting dress to make up for it if her brother marries an obese woman?", "Well, that's why I said NAH. I don't think his sister is being unreasonable by playing into the system she's been told is right and good. I just also don't think it's unreasonable to want to reject that system on your wedding day if it directly affects you.", "Just because they make his sister feel confident doesn't mean his wife has to deal with it at her wedding. A lot of people are comparing it to dieting or tanning in the US, but colourism in many countries is a big part of their caste system. It's more akin to asking someone to cover up their Confederate flag tattoo at a wedding and uninviting them if they don't. It's not exactly that BC I don't think his sister is an AH for trying to take advantage of whatever she can, but his wife is also not for rejecting something that disparages her skin tone.", "It\u2019s not really the same thing though. There\u2019s not a lot of racial baggage wrapped up in tanning, and people don\u2019t feel social pressure to tan their skin to be considered acceptable or to be more likely to be hired for jobs.\n\nI\u2019m trying to think of a good alternative comparison\u2026\n\nMaybe relaxing black hair and the bride saying she wants her sister to wear her hair naturally for the wedding?", "Exactly.

You would think such an adverse reaction to supposed skincare might raise the same flags, but that's just me.", "Yeah, this is a really complex and fraught issue. And I think it goes deeper than a lot of people realize- I have a serum I really like, so I decided to try the rest of the line. But one of the reasons I like the serum is that it\u2019s supposed to help with uneven skin tone. Great! I have the kind of Irish heritage that means I freckle a lot and get blotchily pink from high emotion. Then I read the rest of the boxes and realize in dawning horror that the vitamin c is effective on the freckles because it\u2019s about stopping new pigmentation, and the whole line is just expensive stealth fairness products. Not quite bleaching, but definitely there to stop literally any new pigmentation, and I\u2019ve accidentally been participating in one of the most fucked up colonialist and damaging aspects of the beauty industry in the world. \n\nSo I think asking SIL to change her routine is iffy, but not inviting her or excluding her from all photos is incredibly reasonable", "I don't think that's a good comparison.

So if the bride decides that to be in the wedding, you have to use skin brightening cream, that would be okay? What if the bride said that bridesmaids have to use heavy makeup? They can only weigh a certain weight? It's not her business. Any of it. The brother bringing up the health issue is a red herring. They are free to disinvite his sister over her skin care routine.

She can change whatever she wants about herself.", "Woah, comparing someone's feelings regarding their own skin color is nowhere near the same as having them cover up a confederate tattoo. Instead, it would be like having your friend cover up their vitiligo.

What.", "Imagine thinking this is a rational request. LMAO", "Wow. So, she doesn't want her to even just stop using it for a day? She wants her to stop using it for a whole month? Just for her wedding? That's insane.", "What an absolute psycho lol", "except the roots of skin lightening are not of racist origins but of class. The ancient Romans did it, the Chinese did it, the Feudal Japanese did it, the Vietnamese did it. Middle age Europe did it. Having lighter skin meant that you did not work out doors and were up the upper class an any of those societies.", "Exactly!", ">You dont think its reasonable for the fiancee to not want a reminder that people think her skin (darker) is inherently more ugly and needs to be whitened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's crazy isn't it?  In the part of the world that I am in everybody is getting tanned. Now we have spray tans but previously they weren't available and people like me, a natural redhead who even with a really good tan is still lighter than most people without, had to just accept that our pasty white skin was considered to be unhealthy and unattractive.  Not to mention that every single time I got a little bit of sun or got over heated and flushed I would hear gasps of horror and people loudly exclaiming about my sunburn and how much I was going to hurt the next day.\n\nI honestly never really thought of it that way until today.", "It *is* their choice to disinvite them. Everyone has choices. Doesn't make them good choices. This is a terrible way to start a marriage. Weddings should be about love and joining families, not about pictures and agreeing with beauty preferences and what makes the sister comfortable.", "it\u2019s none of her business. if OP\u2019s sister has an insecurity or feels more confident using her cream, then so be it. if my friend told me not to use my gradual tanner (which, i understand is less controversial than skin bleaching cream) because of her internal opinions on her paleness that would seem ridiculous. ofc not exactly the same contextually, but expecting someone to adjust a routine like this just because of one\u2019s personal opinion on it is snowflakey to me", "thats psychotic thinking the other person is making a judgement on you not on themselves. but whatever world revolves around you.", "SIL is probably making that comment about her own skin which is why she changes it. She can have that opinion and not be saying anything about the bride. If a person with curly hair said curly hair is ugly so she gets a Brazilian blow out that lasts for months, does the bride have the right to tell her not to get the blow out and wear her hair curly for a month because the bride has curly hair? That's overreaching and none of the bride's business.", "That's not the same and has nothing to do with demand. That just was a shitty offer of the fianc\u00e9.", "Truly. I know like I'm playing into this game too by commenting and going on and on. Hahaha like believe me!! Ugh it's just so fucked!!!", "So many people ignoring opinions of people FROM that culture still saying that OP ITA, because it doesn't fit into their narrative of how brown people should think or behave.

Yeah, that isn't racist at all.", "They want the sister to not use the cream for a month before the wedding. It's in the comments. OP should update the original post with this information, it's very important to the post.", "You can't really unravel generations of internalized racism and oppression by strong-arming your sister, though. If she has so much self hatred for being brown that she's willing to risk her health with a dangerous product, forcing her to be browner for one wedding isn't going to take the place of therapy or cause her to have an epiphany.\n\nRacism sucks ass, but OP isn't fixing any part of it this way.", "I am brown, Indian and I understand the context, the cream and everything. OP, fiancee is wrong. \n\nYTA op", "And the context of the comment above yours is that many cultures see being slimmer/fitter as better.

And it wouldn't quite yield magical results i think.", "Yes, this. Some browner skin women think they look better with lighter skin, some lighter skin women think they look better browner. There are disadvantages to using creams to lighten and tanning to darken and the results of those choices belong to the person whose body it is.\n\nAs a person with blotchy pink skin (thanks rosacea), I would love to have a clear complexion in any color but it is for me to decide what I do (or do not do) about it.

My mom had a reaction to chemo that caused the skin on her face and hands to get really dark orange. To the point where she looked like an Oompa Loompa. She was given lightening cream and it helped, but when the chemo was over and she stopped using it, she had patches of skin with no pigmentation for ages.

After all, clean skinned women may feel bad. \n\n\u2022 What about high heels?  Obviously that tells everyone that being short is bad. \n\n\u2022 Going even one further, how about clothes with beads or sequins?  The plainly clothed people might feel that the dressier people are saying plain clothes aren't good enough. \n\n\u2022 Straightened teeth? Whitened teeth? Nice men's shoes? Colored hair? Jewelry? Painted fingernails? Leather or other animal-derived clothing?\n\nIt can all be treated the same, really. Which is why we have so very many of these posts about Brides demanding others *change their appearance* for someone else's event. Brides absolutely have the right to be opposed to certain things, it'd be weird if they didn't have opinions.  But they **do not** have the right to tell someone else how to conduct their appearance in any way that can't be changed within a couple of minutes.  Different shirt? Maybe. Different skin routine? NOPE.", "Once again, those are different scenarios. Colorism is a racist issue in India, and oftentimes is used to oppress others. Sometimes people use it to identify caste, and it can lead to casteism. Having grown up in India, I doubt the sister is only insulting her own skin. Op said she says brown skin is ugly, not that her own brown skin is ugly. And in my experience, here in India, if someone thinks dark skin is ugly they don't shut up about it. In fact expect a lot of people to approach you and make comments to your face about it.", "I acknowledged differing opinions in my comment, but a lot of the judgements seem to think it's absolutely crazy that she would even consider asking the sister not to use the product. Looking at the range of responses from the people whose opinion should matter should at least give the rest of us some pause and consideration for the opposing viewpoints.", "YTA /u/Substantial_Sink5975\n\nYou don't get to decide what someone does with their face. If you don't like them don't invite them, but don't try to be the dictator of other people's personal preferences. That's an asshole move.", "Someone changing THEIR OWN APPEARANCE is not fucking racism. Telling someone else they should is. \n\nIf a dark skinned person prefers having fair skin, then it's up to them and literally no one else. They're not telling you your skin tone is ugly just like a person coloring their hair dark doesn't have prejudice against blonde people.", "That's like saying a black woman has the right to tell other black women they can't wear wigs. Criticizing the social pressure that demonizes natural black hair is fair, but shaming black women for wearing wigs is not okay. It doesn't matter if they were socially conditioned to wear wigs by white beauty standards growing up, it's still ultimately their choice to wear if they want.", "So no hair relaxers, dieting before a wedding, spray tans or hair dye for guests then either? Because all of those are rooted in classism  and racism. I say fuck off with thinking that one person can dictate what another does with their body.

Should I have asked her to remove her implants and dye her hair brown because her aesthetic choices are rooted in sexism and racism? Get the fuck out of here with that.", "Fuck off, the sis can do whatever she wants with her body. You would be well within your rights to exclude them if it was your day but that would still make you the asshole", "If someone is overweight could they stop everyone attending their wedding from dieting?", "Then she needs to send out an email to everyone saying no one is allowed to use skin brightening creams.", "Sure she can. But she has to live with the consequences of such removals. Removing a close relative from your wedding will have significant effects on the future relationship with that person and others who pick their side.", "So are white women that use fake tan also self hating?

My need to constantly chase the skinny dream is my issue and in no way casts dispersions on others.", "You think being upset about colorism is being insecure? The sister has said darker is ugly.

This is centuries of oppression and Eurocentric beauty standards.", "Where do people draw the line on what is an acceptable restriction?  \nPretty sure the line is drawn at racism. \n\nThat's where. \n\nYou can't compare this to wardrobe choices or tattoos/scars.", "I cannot wrap my head around her uninviting the sister of the groom over the sister's own choices. I'm Indigenous, I have olive skin. I would be horrified if someone asked me to change my skin tone for them, I'm equally horrified that someone is trying to pressure someone else to do the same in the opposite way.

I\u2019m a lightskin black dude and if someone is wanted to literally lighten their skin to \u201clook better\u201d they would be uninvited to my wedding as well.", "Tanning became a thing when a lot of labor jobs moved inside out of the sun. So instead of being a sign of labor it was a sign that you could afford leisure time outside. It comes from the same place of being a form of conspicuous consumption.", "What you're seeing in action is social perceptions of class affecting beauty standards.\n\n\n\n\nLet's use Canada as an example; while in Canada an obese woman would diet to fit the societal beauty norms, in parts of West Africa the practice of Leblouh will have women force feed themselves thousands of calories a day to become obese. Why? Because in those societies a fat woman is seen as more attractive due to the historical scarcity of food.\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, in Canada and Northern Europe a tanned woman is seen as more beautiful because a tan in the winter implies you have the resources to head south on vacation or to sit in a covered sun porch instead of working. Meanwhile in many east Asian countries it's the opposite, peasants would get tanned working the fields so being fair skinned implied that you're above manual labor.", "But did OPs sister sayy that or are the making that conclusion based on the use of cream?", "As a white guy, reading some of the comments here is infuriating to me with people not understanding the issue, I can imagine it's really infuriating for you for whom issues like these have a significant impact on your life..", ">Then I read the rest of the boxes and realize in dawning horror that the vitamin c is effective on the freckles because it\u2019s about stopping new pigmentation\n\nCan you please explain what you mean?

I had no idea what it entitled - all i knew was i saw advertisements on tv constantly about how this supposedly made you prettier. And just living in south India, I've heard countless comments about how fairness = prettiness. Even my family told me to use it and they aren't bad people, they honestly didn't know any better because that's how deeply colorism has taken root in our society. So badly that CHILDREN are bleaching their skin. I didn't use it for long thankfully and am now really proud of my skin color. But colorism still persists, so avidly. It's often used to identify (and oppress) caste and often affects women more than men. This is a much deeper issue than simply 'she's fixing her insecurity'. I can't even begin to tell you."]}
