She never uses it, but she also doesn't usually say anything about other people using it either. So I was surprised when she told me she didn't want my sister to use it for our wedding and asked me to convey the message. My sister always uses skin brightening cream for any big event, especially if she will be photographed. So I know she is planning on doing so for our wedding.\n\nMy fiancee said she hates skin brightening cream and doesn't want the use of it immortalized in our wedding photos. She said my sister should understand because this is a small family event and the photos will only be seen by us and our close family. She said it's not unusual for brides to have requests about the look of the wedding party. She would know better than me, so I agreed.\n\nAsking my sister didn't go over well. My sister was furious and said I have no say over her skincare routine. She said she will use whatever products she wants, and if my fiancee has a problem with that she can uninvite her. My fiancee said fine, but then my sister won't be a part of the wedding party or in the photos. My mom and sister are furious about this decision and don't want to work with me at all, telling me to get my wife under control, because she's being ridiculous.\n\nI would think my sister would want to make us happy on our special day and be willing to compromise, but did I ask for too much?\n\nEdit: After talking to my fiancee we've decided to just uninvite my sister. Her beliefs are her own and not really any of our business, but why would we want someone who thinks women who look like my fiancee are ugly to be at our wedding? It just doesn't make sense. I always saw it as a personal choice, but it's more than that. My sister is saying to the world that she thinks brown women are ugly, and while that's sad for her, because she is one, it isn't my fiancee's problem to deal with. So we just won't have her there. No one should have to be told on their wedding day that they are ugly.\n\nClarification: several people have asked me to explain in the post itself what skin brightening cream does, since a lot of commentors are white and don't know. The cream changes your skin so that you look fair, more like a white person than a brown one. It isn't makeup. It fades over time, so you need to keep applying it, and it can make you sick. The reason my fiancee hates it is because she has seen it give friends and relatives skin conditions and other illnesses and because women who use it say women who don't are ugly. My fiancee thinks we should be proud of our brown skin, because our race has accomplished many things. That is why she didn't want its obvious use in our photos. Several people have told me the proper name is skin lightening cream, but in our community we call it skin brightening cream. Apparently white people have a different product also called that which is different.

Your people have a history of bleaching themselves to death with arsenic makeup and blood sucking leeches. You should be against it. \n\nAgain. A wedding is about the bride and groom. Not a petulant, self hating sister. If the bride was vegan, would sister be right to insist upon meat at the reception?", "No the fiance needs to be honest about their opinion and be truthful to their partner. I\n\nIf it was me, yeah I would tell my partner nope, sis will do what she wants, get over it.\n\nBut it is never the place of a partner to 'get them in line'. If they don't like it, they have the option of leaving. But the get her in line is highly abusive and controlling.", "Serious question: if your partner can\u2019t get you in line, who can???", "I think this is a very important point. Anything else is just supposition from OP and his fiance.", "Why would she comment on my skin? I'm a man. It doesn't matter what my skin looks like. No, she has never commented on my fiancee specifically, but my fiancee has explained to me that when my sister says dark skin is ugly that hurts my fiancee because she has dark skin, so it is about her even when it's not directed at her.", "Lmao \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f alright", "So you think it\u2019s reasonable to control what someone does with their own body at your wedding? \n\nShe\u2019s an adult. This is her body. This is no different to brides who want people to get ear piercings or bleach their teeth. It\u2019s taking it way too far. \n\nThis is bridezilla behaviour. \n\nCutting someone out of photos because you disagree with their feelings about their skin \u2014 who is that helping? Who sees a photo of a guest at the wedding and decides that OP and partner are somehow anti-black? It\u2019s ridiculous. It has nothing to do with their values. Their values are irrelevant when it comes to someone else\u2019s bodily autonomy. \n\nIt\u2019s your day, fine. It isn\u2019t your day to control others, and if that\u2019s your focus instead of you and and your partner, you\u2019re kind of missing the entire point.", "Yes, that doesn\u2019t change what I said what so ever.", "No it was crazy and entitled", "Same. I went for ESH in a different comment but could've just as easily gone for NAH. Everyone is in the wrong in some way, but also in the right in someway.", "I am an indian living in india and it is definitely a thing. Grew up with \u201cFair and Lovely\u201d and very Eurocentric standards of beauty.\n\nWe would have statements like \u201cHer features are very sharp but she is dark skinned\u201d mentioned casually.", "Please. I'm dumb. Break it down for me", "I don't really have feelings on this subject either way, I can kind of see both sides, I guess? But I do agree that people tend towards vilifying the bride and forget that context matters most of the time.", "I totally understood what he meant with the cream, I still think it is super unreasonable of the bride to ask for the sister to stop doing what she wants to do with her own body and to uninvite her because of it. She did not do something AGAINST the bride, she does something against herself. \n\nAlso, a wedding is not a photoshoot, it is the union of two families. Which the sister is part of. And now they will think about her anyhow, as the ghost of absence.", "I mean, it isn't about wanting to be white. It is about wanting to look upperclass and have fairer skin. I think that it isn't good for one's skin, but.", "Yeah. It is. I apologize for the bluntness of my comment. Happy new year", "Nah, if the wife comes from a country where it\u2019s banned, then its understandable why she\u2019s against it. It\u2019s culture and people don\u2019t just drop that. Do I agree? Nah, but I won\u2019t pretend like it\u2019s far fetched just because I\u2019m western and don\u2019t quite relate", "So your fianc\u00e9e is not just asking for one day? She\u2019s asking for your sister to change her beauty routine for a whole month or longer. YTA.", "Your fianc\u00e9e can be proud of her skin all she wants, she can\u2019t dictate how others feel about theirs. Telling your sister to change her skincare routine because of your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s preferences is controlling and ridiculous. If your fianc\u00e9e was against using makeup would you tell your guests they can\u2019t wear makeup in the month leading up to and at the wedding? What about if your fianc\u00e9e decides she doesn\u2019t like facial hair and wants anyone in the wedding party to shave off any beards or mustaches? How about she decides the removal of body hair offends her now so nobody can shave in the month before the wedding? Your fianc\u00e9e can decide whatever she wants for her own body. She can\u2019t use your wedding as an excuse to control other people\u2019s bodies.", "okay so it probably is about the lightening ones that act like or have bleaching agents in them.\n\ni agree they can be harmful, and if your wife doesnt like them thats fair enough. each to their own. \n\nhow much is she willing to enforce this? is there any compromise she can make? for example, makeup can even out or lighten skin too. is the sister willing to do that?", "Forcing her views on the bride would be demanding the bride use the product..", "Getting someone in line can be something as mundane as having a conversation with them about an issue. I don't know why you seem so determined to jump to misogyny, abuse and controlling behaviour. The other person also explained what they meant pretty clearly.", "This ^", "Same here: \u201cFair is always more beautiful than dark skinned.\u201d But my what am saying is generally in my country, skin brightening cream is just something like a moisturiser u put on ur face. Not something that will whiten the skin with very visible effects.", "Exactly what I mean, there's no thought process or questioning at all before coming out guns blazing with some very strong opinions", "No, you are right to correct people who are ignorant and think like that! I was just truly confused, and thought the wrong thing. Happy new year to you as well!", "It doesn\u2019t matter where the wife is from. She doesn\u2019t have to use but she cannot make SIL not use it.", "Her compromise is not having my sister in the pictures, but my mom and sister are upset by that offer.", "Forcing her views on the bride would be demanding the bride abandon her anti colorist stance.", "\"Getting someone in line\" literally means make them obey you. You can arguably use it for animals or children, never for a partner (unless you're in a sub/dom dynamic). There's a strong subtext that the original commenter may not have meant but they can't fault other people for reading it that way.", "You didn't know. I was confused until OP said, \"she got fairer\". Then I connected the dots. This isn't a fade cream for imperfections; this is bleach. \n\nHowever, a lot of countries package bleaching products as \"brightening\". More pc", "Oh I agree, you can\u2019t tell anyone to do anything and op is wrong for asking. But Tbh, the SIL shouldn\u2019t be bleaching, at the end of the day it IS bad for you. op and wife should talk to her about the implications of it and provide resources with why she should stop. Not for the wedding, but in general. (Also lol she\u2019s been bleaching for who knows how long already, stopping a bit before the wedding wouldnt change her appearance, that\u2019s not quite how bleaching works so I think OP is a bit confused too)", "the implications are bigger than if the fiancee likes it or not; yes she can't stop sil from using it, but the issue is a cultural and colorist one, so in fact, where they're from is actually super important", "do your wife and family get along usually?", "Because it's not a compromise. It's excluding your sister entirely over something as ridiculous as what she uses for skincare.", "I understand it to mean trying to get something or someone to act in an orderly manner. I think you can get a partner in line because sometimes they act out of line. It is not an inherently controlling, abusive, demeaning etc action. I'm not trying to be obtuse here and act like people don't say that to particularly men who are in relationships with women but, I personally don't see the issue with someone saying that when the partner is genuinely being shitty."]}
