Oh, and he is behind on child support too. I hope you have saved all the conversations between yourself and your ex to share with his friends.", "NTA - He won\u2019t ever have a relationship with them unless he wants to.

Trying to terminate parental rights \"so he wouldn't get the kids if something happens\" seems counterproductive.  What is your plan in that case?\n\nI would take him to court if he's behind enough on child support, but if you terminate his parental rights, it likely lets him off the hook for support as well.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t see the point of taking this to court. If your ex is paying child support I don\u2019t think you can actually get him for abandonment (but never Venmo him anything back, WTF is he thinking?).\n\nJust block your friends from school asking why \u201cyou won\u2019t let him see the kids.\u201d If you want, close with a message saying, \u201cDespite what he may have said, it\u2019s his choice not to see our kids, I am not preventing him,\u201d but who cares what these people think?\n\nI\u2019m a child of divorce and my dad lost interest in me and I didn\u2019t see him after I was about eleven, not once. He had two kids with my stepmother and I\u2019m sure they did lots of vacations without me and didn\u2019t mention me to other people. And you know what? I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t care. That\u2019s one thing you e never mentioned: do your kids even miss their dad? If they did I might see your point but if he\u2019s been absent for six years your kids were 6 (and developmentally delayed) and 1 when they last saw him, so I doubt they had any real attachment to him.\n\nSo you\u2019re NTA, I understand your annoyance, but I think the lawsuit would be for you, and about you wanting to punish your ex and his new wife, not really about your kids. Your ex and his wife don\u2019t consider your kids \u201cfamily,\u201d which is awful of him in a way, but not surprising. Some men (and some women) find it very easy to abandon their previous children, which makes them a-holes, but\u2026 why chase an a-hole to get him to spend time with your kids?\n\nI recommend letting this go. Take the child support, ALL of it, and be glad this jerk has shown his true colors and isn\u2019t interfering in your children\u2019s lives.

He moved on and he's not going to see the light, or change and become their father. It's terrible and he's a complete and utter AH, maybe the biggest AH of all time, but that's the truth of it. Feeling bitter is a totally understandable reaction. But it doesn't hurt him, only you. Don't drink poison then wait for your enemy to die.\n\nRegardless, I hope you have not ever sent him back any of the child support. \n\nINFO: I don't know what the benefit of taking him to court would be. What is the outcome you hope for from that?", "NTA   I'd ask you what your objective in taking him to court is, though.  You can't force a relationship there and it seems like he's pretty much pushed the reset button on his life and doesn't want his first two kids. It's awful, but if you force visitation, what kind of further damage is that going to inflict on them?  Cut your losses, hold him to his required payments and ignore the shade about not letting him see the kids.  The people who know you and your kids know the real situation, and the others don't matter.", "Info: What would be the best outcome of taking him to court? Is there financial (or other potential) gain that could help your children?", "Nta", "NTA but you are kind of playing into his game if you decide to do this as it will make you look like the bitter ex. \n\nUnfortunately you can\u2019t force him to be a father to your children. Do not send money back to him, child support is the only way he\u2019s contributing for his biological children and it\u2019s not your responsibility to worry about his new family. Why is he even asking for child support back when he\u2019s going on extravagant trips?? Don\u2019t respond to any of his messages with empty promises, it will show him that you know it\u2019s all BS. Stop keeping tabs on his family and what they doing. Remember you are only seeing what they are willing to show and is not worth the anger it causes. When people accuse you of alienating him just tell them that if he believes that then he can take you to court for visitation. Take care of yourself and your children. Sooner or later things will go askew with his new family. Already they are having financial issues. Men like him don\u2019t change.
