{"id": 21906, "submission_id": "14wdb9s", "title": "WIBTA for refusing to train a \"family\" dog that I don't want?", "selftext": "My spouse wants to buy a dog for Coyote protection. He has his heart set on a male German Shepard for some reason. And it has to be a puppy. He won't pay 2-3k for an already trained adult dog. \n\nHe said a number of things that I disagree with, like female dogs \"are not aggressive enough to protect us from coyotes\" and he only wants a male. I told him a good herding dog, like Pyrenees, is much bigger and can defend itself from coyotes, But germs are smaller and might possibly get injured by a pair of coyotes. He said no, they are aggressive and a better choice and eat less food.\n\nBut the most major part of the disagreement is that I said I don't want to take care of a dog at all. It's hard enough caring for and cleaning up after a young child, adding a puppy on top of that is just an insane amount of work that I don't want put upon me. I'm going to be the one doing 100% of the care for this animal and I just don't want to. \n\nHe works 5-day-straight shifts, so he's only home on the weekends. I'm the SAHM.  I'd have to do *everything* for this dog except buy his food. I'd be the one dealing with puppy drama 24 hours a day until it's successfully trained... peeing/vomiting/pooping in the house, tearing up the furniture, teaching him not to nip or jump our kid, teaching the kid how to be gentle with a large dog, trying to potty train it to go outside, cleaning up all the poo chunks in the yard after he's done for the rest of his life, brushing his fur and grooming him, dealing with fleas and medication and doctor visits. I have allergies to pet dander so I would be having to use antihistamines for the next 11-15 years. \n\nNot to mention that ***I have no idea how to train*** a guard dog or a herding dog. He thinks I can just learn from online instructions how to properly train a dog that will guard humans and livestock, but still attack pests like coyotes and rats. \n\nHe told me I was being dramatic, it's his money and he can get one if he wants. I told him If he gets this dog while I don't want it, then I'm going to refuse to train it at all because I don't want a dog in the first place. He can train him on his weekends off and deal with the destroyed furniture and the pee puddles himself. He said I'm a lazy AH and I'm the SAHM, so the animals are my responsibility along with the kids, while he works to pay the bills. \n\nI feel like I might be an AH for saying what I said, because it's not the dog's fault and he deserves proper training regardless of his circumstances. He's not the one choosing to be here. But I also don't think I'm wrong because I already said I don't want the responsibility of another pet, if he wants it, he can take care of it or pay someone to come train his dog. He's only making me do it because he doesn't want to spend a lot of money on an already trained guard dog.

Also OP do you have livestock or small pets that need protection from coyotes? Or is this just human protection? Because coyote attacks on humans are pretty rare . Not impossible, but according to the humane society you are more likely to be killed by a golf ball or champagne cork than a coyote. Sure in certain situations like injury, illness, starvation, dehydration, pregnancy, giving birth, mating season, and raising pups can lead to coyotes coming closer to humans for more resources and can lead to more aggressive behavior but most coyote attacks are preventable by modifying human behavior ans educating people about coyotes.

Very few dogs are even middling good at both - I've known collies that would deter foxes and possums but were primarily herding. I've known herding dogs that were GOOD at their jobs herding and even ok at deterring burglars, that would get killed very quickly by coyotes. I have seen Shelties herd like hell - and they don't eat a lot or knock kids over - but a Sheltie ain't doing more than sounding an alarm on a coyote. It's not their job. They don't weigh very much.

Considering your allergy, that is also very problematic.  \nI am not knowledgeable about coyotes but are there no other ways to fend off coyotes than getting a dog ?", "No way should you be forced to take antihistamines because of a pet. I get why people do it but IMHO that\u2019s ludicrous. NTA.", "NTA but please don\u2019t get a dog. If you can\u2019t provide the home the dog needs, please rehome him to someone who can and wants him. It\u2019s understandable in your situation not wanting that responsibility and I hope you and your kid can leave your husband because the amount of disrespect he shows you in just this post is shocking. You deserve better. Your kid deserves better.", "NTA but Start looking for a job and daycare op cause this isn't a good situation for you.", "NTA but your hubby kind of is. Don't antis also stop working eventually if used too often? Say...constantly over a decade?", "YTA to yourself and child for staying with this abuser. A month ago you said you were calling a lawyer and getting out? What happened to that plan?!? \n\nSpeaking as a vet, German shepherds are NOT dogs for beginners. This breed has significant health and behaviours issues that require intensive management. I can\u2019t remember the last time I met one that wasn\u2019t fear aggressive, which can be very dangerous if you have small children. You have no knowledge of dog behaviour and no desire/time to learn - do not do this. \n\nThis dog will make you miserable and do nothing but cause MORE fights between you and your husband. He is giving you an unnecessary, dangerous impossible task so that when you inevitably fail, he has more ammunition to put you down and control you. Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t bring an innocent animal into your mess of a marriage. Get help.", "NTA but damn your husband is a piece of work who thinks rather highly of himself. You\u2019re a stay at home MUM not a stay at home pet trainer \ud83d\ude44", "As much as I'd like to glean something positive out of this, it's just seems too draining to even read, especially knowing you have an allergy that might aggravate with time. \n\nESH simply because it somehow feels like you are enabling this behaviour of his and its time for marriage counselling. And this most probably can't be rectified unless you start a job asap and get your child in daycare or make him stay at home. Any other way, you'll end up being taken advantage of and the process will continue. If not dog, then something else. \n\nIf you can get a job from home itself, that'll be a lifesaver, but again depends on your educational qualifications to get a remote job. His attitude might put you in grave trouble in the future if you remain without savings.", ">  I have allergies to pet dander so I would be having to use antihistamines for the next 11-15 years. \n\nHow is this not a bigger deal to you? This is pretty insane to me. \n\nNot sure about the SAHM thing though since no one from where I am is one but if he is using financial power to pressure you into having an unwanted pet that is un-healthy for you then that is something that has to be addressed. NTA obviously.", "NTA.  Your husband is being a total dick.  Puppies are fucking hard work.  Moreso that little kids.", "Sounds like OP is married to a fucking donkey\u2026", "Plus for laundry service, cook, maid, sex.", ">Did he tell you why he absolutely wants a puppy ?\n\nNo he won't give me a reason\n\n>I am not knowledgeable about coyotes but are there no other ways to fend off coyotes than getting a dog\n\nProbably but I don't know of any", "Please Please Please pay the dog tax for sharing this enchanting pup!", "Why the hell are you tolerating verbal abuse .. girl NTA but get out of that situation. You and your kids don\u2019t deserve that.", "A lot of GSDs aren't very interested in what people besides their primary human want. My oldest girl loves my partner but still tends to ignore anything he asks that she doesn't feel like doing. She'll just walk off to come find me instead. If he has cheese or a toy she'll perform very well, but otherwise? Nah.", "It means it's time to take your kid and LEAVE!!!", "Literally financial and emotional abuse. Can\u2019t even imagine what your kids will turn out like if this is the example they get at home \u2026 please think about them if you won\u2019t leave for yourself!", ">>he told me I need to stop making it about myself. I'm not sure what that means in this context, though.\n\nIt means he thinks you\u2019re the help and you\u2019re not doing your job. Refer again to what I said above.", "If one of your friends had written this comment and the \u201clazy AH\u201d one, would you suggest she stay with that man? I hope a dog is not added to this situation but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the main issue here.", "wow. the household is your business. that is absurd. is he physically abusive?", "Gestures are so incredibly useful for training dogs. I learnt it when I volunteered at an animal shelter and taught my dogs gestures along with verbal commands. I can tell my dogs to sit, stay, lay down, and calm down without uttering a word. Very handy when I\u2019m the only one awake, and now that one of my dogs is old and going deaf he still obeys commands because he can still see me, my husband or my mum doing the hand gestures.", "Or get rid of Old Guy. I would be seriously considering this.", "Our older dog is deaf, so we trained her with hand gestures. When we got our younger dog, we started doing both verbal and hand gestures with him because it was what we were used to and we didn't see a downside in teaching him both ways."]}
