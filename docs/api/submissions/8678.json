{"id": 8678, "submission_id": "10ozdhc", "title": "AITA for locking my roommate out in -20 weather?", "selftext": "I am a 19 year old female and live in a apartment located in a college town with two 20 year old guys. We get along great and have never had issues. This morning I woke up at 2am to the doorbell repeatedly going off downstairs. When I heard my other roommate run downstairs I rolled over and started going back to sleep. To give context on our door locking system we have one lock where we put in a code and the bottom lock on the door is for a standard key. The general rule is that during the day we only lock the door with the automatic lock and at night we lock both. It also should be noted that both roommates have been living here for less than a year after subletting from my old roommates. Over just the last 8mo 5 different people have been my roommates. Anyway, I went downstairs at 1am tonight to grab a snack and noticed both locks weren\u2019t locked. Not even thinking about it, I went and locked the second one. In my head 1am is late, so if you\u2019re out past then you probably should have a key. Fast forward back to 2am, my roommate came inside yelling at my other one about how cold it was and asking why the second lock was locked? He then proceeded to tell my other roommate he in fact didn\u2019t forget his key BUT he never got a key from the old roommate when he moved in. This man has been living here since August 2022 and he never thought to inform me about not having a key? Or at least take any initiative to acquire one? I feel like a jerk now for locking the door because of how cold it was outside. But also I feel like maybe he should\u2019ve been more responsible?

However, I think what you said about 5 different people over 8 months is a bit concerning from a safety perspective.  Especially with you being the only female.   It would be a good idea to speak to those subletting and come up with a consistent process involving new roommates and giving/returning keys when people move in and out.", "NTA and, more importantly, there could be a key floating around in the wild.

That's on him.", "NTA sounds like you made an honest mistake based on lack of communication from the locked-out roommate.", "NTA if he didn't have a key he should've mentioned it to you. Seriously how were you to know?", "NTA he's trying to push his problem onto you. It's reasonable to expect him to have a key. It's also reasonable to keep the door locked at night.", "NTA. You didn't lock him out on purpose, for crying out loud.\n\nHe's an idiot and, quite frankly, a total AH for thinking it's okay to leave the door unlocked because he's too lazy to bother about getting a key. No concern for your safety.", "NTA...now he understands why he needs a key.", "NTA. \n\nYour roommate is criminally negligent in living somewhere without a key for months. \n\nAlso, probably more important, there are keys out there for your door where the owners of those keys are the type to not care to hand these keys in. They could - literally - step in any moment, to just drop off the key and be done with it. The fact they didn't means they can come by any moment to get stuff out of the house too. \n\nI'd request a new lock, and new keys for all roommates, and noone else.", "nta . he should have told you he didn't have a key", "NTA.\n\nAs you stated OP, he needed to take the initiative to ask for a key, this could have been avoided.", "NTA. there was no way for you to know he still wasn't inside, you were just ensuring your own safety, as you should, and 1am is late enough.", "YTA, use better judgment next time.
