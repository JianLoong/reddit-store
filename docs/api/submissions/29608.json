I totally understand how people take advantage of other people. \n\nBut in this particular case, your BIL was paying you back for the favor of letting them use your house, which restored balance. That was a perfect equal exchange of favors within a family. You made it weird by paying him - it didn't only tip the balance back to them owing you but it also kind of put him down to the level of being just a tradesperson, not a family member. \n\nYTA for this particular event.", "YTA because you\u2019re paying them for the wrong reason.

You robbed your BIL of the feel-good feeling one gets from helping someone else out.  Time to rethink your never taking anything from anyone.  Sometimes it IS the right thing to do.", "YTA.  I think just like you do.  I hate owing favors to anyone.  But in this case, you were wrong.   He was returning the favor for letting him stay at your house.  Things evened out.   Now, he owes you again.  Bad move.", "YTA. \n\nI dont like taking favors either but close family is generally an exception. \n\nPlus You did them a favor and they did you a favor. \n\nYou cannot go through life blaming the entire world for a few people who did not return your dad's favors.", "Yta in this specific case.  He already owed you - for letting him stay. Maybe he *also* doesn't like to owe.", "NTA  \nBut living life like it's a constant ledger to be balanced sounds exhausting. You did a nice thing for your sister and BIL, like your father actually, and they just wanted to thank you. Why not accept that for what it is and not assume that you will owe them. \n\nI suggest therapy to work through whatever your issues are with your dad and his generosity. Learning to accept kindness from others is a healthy thing.", "i see this as them repaying YOU a favor not the other way around, so YTA", "So let me get this straight. You let them stay in your home for a full week, *for free*, saving them probably over $1000 on hotels or AirBnBs, and in return, your BIL decided to do a few hours of plumbing work as a way of saying thank you. Then you decided to make it weird and unbalanced once more by insisting on paying him. Yes, YTA.", "Dude, you let them stay in your house(favor), they installed your bathroom fixture(returned the favor). This would considered equal- they didn\u2019t take advantage of you, you didn\u2019t take advantage of them. This is how life works. Your dad is happy to do things for others, seemingly not expecting anything back for his generosity. It doesn\u2019t bother him. You take great offense to this and overcompensate by paying people when payment is unnecessary in most instances. YTA.", "**YTA** in a huge way.\n\nI really detest people like you, OP, because your \"insistence on paying\" usually severely undervalues the favor done.   If you really wanted to make this a business transaction, you should have signed a contract with your BiL and had him invoice you for the work.  Instead you let him do you a favor, then tossed him some cash (probably less than what the work was worth) and call it even in your head.\n\nReminds me of when my mom spent the day picking strawberries and brought few quarts to my great-aunt, and my great-aunt insisted on \"paying for them\" by giving my mom the face value of the berries.  It completely undermined the nice thing my mom was trying to do, undervalued the work of driving out and picking fresh strawberries under the hot sun, and delivering them to the old goat.\n\nYTA, OP, and I hope you figure this out sooner rather than later.", "YTA. It's one thing to choose to pay movers rather than ask your friends for help. I get that. I'm the same way. I don't want to impose on people. But that's different from someone doing something nice for you and you turning around and throwing cash at them.\n\nIn addition to this behavior blatantly saying \"I don't ever want to owe YOU anything,\" which you've fully admitted is how you feel, it also makes people feel like shit because it turns a kind gesture of friendship into a financial exchange. \n\nIt's okay to not want to be taken advantage of or take advantage of others. It's also okay to offer kindness and receive it in turn. That's actually a huge part of having relationships with other people.", "YTA\n\nTruly. Your BIL fixed your plumbing as a way to say thank for letting us stay in your house. Instead of just letting your BIL feel good about being able to repay you with kindness and help, **you pissed all over his generosity so now he feels like hired help** and an AH. You turned his gesture of goodwill and appreciation into a monetary transaction.\n\nHe didn\u2019t need, want, or expect the money and your total inability to accept that he did something nice for you is truly an AH way to say thank you.\n\n**Being able to graciously accept unconditional gifts from others is just as important as being able to give unconditional help or gifts**. You gave that to your sister and BIL but forbade them to do the same for you in return. That\u2019s extremely insulting and hurtful to them.\n\nBut, you be you, and live your transactional life. I truly pity any romantic partners you may find in life because transactional relationships are a really shitty way to love someone.\n\nPerhaps people took advantage of your dad on occasion, but the joy he felt helping others likely far, far exceeded those that took advantage. You took all the kindness and generosity your father had and twisted it into a mangled heap where you can\u2019t even imagine just letting people be kind to you. That\u2019s pretty fucked up dude. And sounds so very lonely.", "YTA. You already repaid the favour by letting them stay at your place. By giving him money, you basically slapped him in the face.", "It can be offensive and off putting. Which is what you did to BIL. YTA", "YTA.\n\nLiving a transactional life where scorekeeping is the norm is not only exhausting but alienating.\n\nPeople, usually, volunteer to help members of their family, peer group or community.  You arbitrarily assign a monetary value to their kindness and possibly rob them of catharsis.\n\nI'll take $500 via venmo for my comment, while you're at it.", "YTA. Also this seems like a very illogical response to your dad\u2019s situation\u2026 you\u2019re basically doing the same thing as him, but pretending it means you have more control over things? Where you do other people favors but don\u2019t  get any favors done for you, except you\u2019re trying to make it a weird power dynamic where it keeps you in the position of power by not letting other people do favors, instead of presumably being weak like your dad by hoping for but not getting favors done in return? It\u2019s weird and would definitely make me feel less comfortable in a relationship. Because it is a sign of trust, to be vulnerable enough to appreciate what someone else has to offer, and no relationship can really grow without some kind of reciprocity. If you\u2019re always keeping accounts it means you don\u2019t actually trust or value your relationship with them.", "Even now that you \"paid\" him, it wouldn't mean he didn't do you a favour; it just makes YTA.", "YTA - money doesn\u2019t buy everything- even when the job is bid and contract signed you\u2019ll find you need goodwill.  In the case of family and friends they actually don\u2019t want your money. These are core life lessons.", "Dude you're taking it too far. I get not wanting to be taken advantage of but you're creeping up to crazy level. You know beer and pizza is considered payment yeah? And your bil repaid your favour of letting them stay by doing you a favour and you were ungrateful. You couldve just said \"you didnt have to do that but thanks next time your in town lets go out for dinner\" or some shit. So in this instance yta.", "If you think about it, it is very rude to insist other people must owe you favors. You don\u2019t owe BIL a favor, he is returning the favor you did for him! \n\nUnless you have reason to think he is tried to take advantage of you, it is rude to your BIL (and your sister) to assume that he was trying to finagle a favor or money out of you.\n\nYour family member did a nice thing for you and you basically said \u201cI don\u2019t trust you, you are trying to take advantage of me\u201d. How do you expect to maintain loving and caring relationships with anyone (family/friends) if any time they do something nice for you, you treat it as them trying to con you.  \n\nThink about if your sister said to you \u201cThanks for letting us stay at your house, but I know it\u2019s only because you want to take advantage of me latter (not because you care about me), so to prevent you from screwing me over, I\u2019m going to pay you the equivalent cost of a hotel\u201d. It is very insulting! It\u2019s insulting and upsetting to be treated like a scammer when you do something nice for someone of care or altruism!\n\nI know you are worried about someone taking advantage of you, but for close friends and family maybe don\u2019t assume that to be the case? If they do try to take advantage of you it\u2019s fine to set boundaries and be standoffish, but don\u2019t pre-ruin your relationships.\n\nYTA", "I say this nicely, but YTA.

Your complex will come back to haunt you", "YTA\n\nThat's just so sad. I feel sorry for you. They were trying to show you gratitude because you let them stay at your house. Instead of receiving it gracefully, you turned it into commerce. \n\nActs of service is how people show love. You deserve to be loved too. Please get some therapy.", "Light YTA\n\nThe reason this was rude is because he was already paying you back for a favor you were doing them. By refusing to accept the favor you are keeping him in a position of him owing you, which isn't what you want either. The bigger problem though is that your whole attitude towards favors is an over reaction to the abuse you saw your father suffer.\n\nYes, there are people who will take advantage of you, who will take and give nothing in return, but that is not everyone, and to assume so is to be distrustful, and to distrust people for no reason, especially people close to you, IS to be rude.", "I really hope this is fake.  It's such a sad way to live.  Take the guy who stayed at your place and did some plumbing for you in return.  He thinks you're kind of an AH now (but he took the money, so there's that.)  You can have friends give, and even sacrifice sometimes without being taken advantage of.  It's a rewarding part of relationships.  You shouldn't cut normal good things out of your life because of your dad.  That's just substituting one eccentricity for another.", "YTA. You're being rigid and rude.", "YTA. Life isn't quid pro quo and that's the way you are treating things. You were kind to let them use your home. He had the skills to install the fixtures expecting nothing in return. Kindness for kindness. You turned it into a transaction. Such a shame", "YTA. He owed you a favor and was repaying, just like you prefer to repay people. You wouldn't have owed them anything. Staying at your place was worth a few hundred, fixing your fixtures was worth a few hundred. \n\nI get it, you don't want to be your dad, but someone else said you're overcorrecting, and I agree.", "INFO: How does your BIL feel?", "Gentle YTA... Allowing someone to do something for you build them up. It builds a friendship. Keeping track undermines one. (This doesn't mean that you take advantage, just don't count the pennies)\n\nIt would be better if you were to be gracious and tell them that you appreciate them. (However pizza and beer for movers is expected - followed by a thank you party if you really want to to show your appreciation)\n\nYou know that you have a real friend when neither of you keep track of who's turn it is. You are just there when you are needed.", "YTA.  Paying people in that situation is a hostile act which says that you think you are better than them, that they are not your equal.  Giving and receiving favors is a way of maintaining community bonds.\n\nThere are two kinds of economies - market economies, based on specific, defined trades of known value, and gift economies, based on favors, reciprocity, personal respect, and interpersonal connection.   And most of us live using both - market economy with strangers, gift economy with friends.\n\nYour desire to not participate in gift economies is a refusal to maintain interpersonal bonds and be part of a community.  It is an asshole move.", "YTA\n\n\nIt is well explained why this case your behaviour was a-hole territory, but honestly, you are an ahole to yourself too.\n\n\n\nNot counting on getting favors and not accepting any under any situation is different. You are actually a lot like your father in a way that you still do things for other people and simply refuse to get anything back. This gives you the feeling of being in control, but what does it really achieve? \n\n\nAlso- accepting a favor doesn't mean you have to do every single favor you'll be ask to do.\n\n\n\n(Hiring movers is still a good idea though)", "YTA for not allowing them to pay you back for your kindness in a way that keeps the relationships equal. Giving and receiving favours is the bedrock of our social relationships, and you're cutting people you care about off from an important part of it. It makes them feel weird and bad.\n\nYTA to yourself as well, because if you continue to do this consistently you will drive them away. You know what happens when you only allow people to take and never give? The people who value equality move on, and the people who stay are those *comfortable with taking and never giving*. Users. Selfish assholes. That's what your behaviour attracts.", "Idk if your question is correct. You aren\u2019t an asshole because you aren\u2019t doing this to hurt people but because you have internal struggles with owing people. Which I get. Is it a bit extreme tho? Yes. Society expects you to act a certain way and that is not always what we feel comfortable in but I wouldn\u2019t say that there is no value in trying to adhere to it. You do need to work on being okay with taking favors. Could be that they fixed your stuff as a return to you letting them stay? I think they felt that you viewed them as materialistic for doing something for you instead if just thanking them for being a nice person. Some people are simply nice and don\u2019t want people doing stuff for them in return.", "My dad was that kind of guy, too. There was a disabled man he worked with who asked for a ride home. Every. Single. Day. Even though he could drive himself. This went on for months. My mom had just about convinced him to cut the man off\u2014but the man died. My dad was a pallbearer at his funeral\u2014the man had very few friends. Dad later told me his coworker was just lonely. His marriage was sad, and his only child never talked to him. My dad regretted nothing. I want to be just like my dad.\n\nYTA", "NAH. I don't think you are obligated to accept help. Especially from a BIL rather than a friend - you are presumably not that close. It's not like you were angry at him.\n\nOTOH you probably are excessively anxious about this, and should consider working on accepting help. Accepting help from a friend is accepting a gift. It's a form of love and bonding. You can make it a sometimes thing, but you should probably be willing to exchange support from others.", "I think NAH, but you\u2019re just barely not the asshole. \n\nI understand why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. It sucks to see someone you love have their generosity exploited and never reciprocated. The thing is I don\u2019t think you\u2019re understanding the feelings of others or how these implied social relationships work.\n\n You refuse to allow the ambiguity that could potentially indebt you to someone since that possibility makes you uncomfortable, which is a normal feeling. The issue is you allow others to enter situations where they might feel they owe you and then you refuse to allow them to pay off that obligation since you feel like it\u2019s clear they shouldn\u2019t owe you anything and you don\u2019t want that favor to create obligation on your part. Feeling like you owe someone is by design not a comfortable feeling since it encourages most people to return the favor. \n\nYour attempt to escape that cycle is just leading to people feeling uncomfortable since they can never do anything nice for you for its own sake, but you\u2019re allowed to do them favors. I fully believe you have no intention to create obligations in others, but no one else can know that for sure and that kind of one sided generosity can be uncomfortable. \n\nNo one is required to follow social norms, but it\u2019s foolish to think that you can break them without any kind of consequence. I don\u2019t know if you have already or not, but if you can I\u2019d suggest therapy to try and resolve how to more effectively relate to society in these ways. It\u2019s up to you what you do, but it will continue to cause problems if you don\u2019t find another way.", "YTA in this particular event \n\nOtherwise I\u2019m generally the same with with very very few exceptions", "NTA.

Just imagine if the situation had been reversed how you would react.\n\nYour goal of not being taken advantage of is a reasonable one, but you need to be a bit more pragmatic and look at it on a case by case basis - friends helping each other move for pizza is a pretty typical favour and one easily repaid, so unless you intend on refusing every request of such help from a friend, helping each other is fine.\n\nThe fact that you have seen your father being taken advantage of and don't want to repeat that means you are already aware of the situation and able to act appropriately to keep some balance - help those that help you back, and when you do find someone taking advantage and mooching off you, then you can cut them off.", "I'm sorry your dad had crappy friends and kept giving to them without noticing it was a one way street.

Doing it to get out of \"owing\" them (which you wouldn't anyway) is just selfish and cynical.", "I'm gonna say NAH as I don't think paying someone unexpectedly is ever really an AH mood (unless it's sex with an SO... That'd be pretty insulting)\n\nBut I do think OP made the wrong move here.\n\nOP, Your BIL basically did that work in order to repay YOU for letting them stay there. So by paying him cash, you are basically forcing your BIL into owing you a favor for staying at your place. Maybe you don't think so, but as someone who doesn't like owing favors or having others owe you favors, it surprises me that you don't see how this could bother someone. You're saying \"I refuse to owe people anything!\" while then doing something that makes your BIL think he still owes you a favor. I would apologize and explain your stance and that you were being dense at the time.", "I'm not going to call you an AH, but you need to understand that for people who *aren't* a-holes, it's quite an uncomfortable feeling to owe a favour. So your Brother in law probably felt pretty good about doing something for you to thank you for the favour you did them.", "You are pushing people away with your money and indirectly accusing them of having ulterior motives behind their kindness. Whether we like or not, there is always the chance you will get burned by anybody due to the very nature of social interaction with others, but it is foolish to treat people like your family members as equally capable and willing to take advantage of you as someone you have never met and have no history with. If your dad associated with greedy and manipulative people that was a mistake that he made, but that is not indicative of the world at large, so you shouldn't treat your family as if they are just looking for any excuse to take advantage of you.\n\nYTA. But you don't have to be.", "YTA for the episode with BIL. Installing fixtures was a nice gesture in return for the stay. I\u2019d call it even. \n\nI understand you don\u2019t want to be like your father but you\u2019re taking it too far imho. Friends, family, even work, owing favors, a little give and take make things run smoother and less exhausting. \n\nYou\u2019re given favors more than you receive. Indeed, not unlike your father. The main difference is you are more in control. Obsessively.", "nta! you're not harming anyone with your point of view. \nI understand where you're coming from!\nI think paying your bil is a little uncouth? ycbta for that .. but I understand why you did it, not being in anyone's debt is important for you.", "YTA. You need to accept people's gifts. They give them because they like you. \n\nOf course, if you get a sense they are deliberately trying to obligate you, then it's fair to refuse. Also fair if you know it would put them in a state of financial stress.", "Soft YTA. Depends on how you intend to build the relationship though. If you want nothing more, sure, pay him. Idk why your sister freaks out, I would take the cash and accept you as who you are.\nIf you think they are good people and you want in your life, I\u2019d invite them out for food or get them a nice gift. Relationships need efforts.", ">I do people favors. But only if I feel like it. And I do them knowing in advance that I cannot count on reciprocity.\n\nThis 100% superiority stance of yours comes across as something else, OP.\n\nYTA.", "I feel like you\u2019re missing the point of what you\u2019re trying to do. In your opinion your dad did favours and got nothing in return. So he did the first favour. You\u2019re declining to accept a favour someone did for you which is the opposite to what you believe happened to your father. You don\u2019t want to be treated as a doormat, I get that. But that is not this situation and not was it when your friends offered to help you move. Give and take is part of any relationship. Too much take and feel free to cut those leeches out of your life but it\u2019s healthy to do favours for friends when you know they\u2019d do the same for you. \nIn this situation you did a favour by offering your house. You expected nothing in return. You gave the money because you hate owing people (opposite to your dads situation). Have you considered your bil may feel the same way? But you are not accepting that. You have two different standards, one for yourself and one for others. Don\u2019t push people away. I\u2019m going with a soft YTA for not accepting the gesture from your bill which is also his way of balancing the favour that you offered first. I think you would benefit from some self-reflection on this as it sounds like you\u2019re surrounded by some great people and you have some rigid ideas that you should ease up on.", "NTA - I think that people who are hyper-independent become that way because they couldn't often rely on people when they were kids.  So instead of \"hoping\" or \"expecting\" people to help out -- they learned how to be self-reliant.  Or perhaps things always came with strings or guilt so now they don't want to \"owe\" anyone anything.  They would rather just do it themselves.\n\nDoesn't make you an asshole at all, but you might want to examine if you feel like this is a coping mechanism /pattern from your past.  It's often safer when we don't owe anyone anything -- but then we might miss out on the joy of receiving from people who give because they want to and they care.  It's a tough one for sure.", "Yta\n\nWhy are you the ONLY one who can do favors.  No one else can? \n\nNo one else is allowed to repay a kindness?  (So you can continue believing no one does you favors or returns your kindness).\n\nGet some therapy and apologize to your BIL.", "My parents were like your dad, so I get it, but you\u2019re going way too far the other way. You\u2019re here talking about how you always want to pay for anything anyone ever does for you, but then you refuse to allow others to do the same in return. You did a favor for your BIL, so he wanted to do something in return, but you refused to let him, and made it weird by keeping him in the position where he feels he owes you. Imagine if someone refused to let you pay them back for something you saw as a big favor to you? YTA.", "it is okay you are doing great.\n\ni am not upto your level but even i hate getting favours. even i go one step further and deal with any favor because i do not want to be in debt of anyone.\n\nseriously, i do not see the problem.\n\nNTA.\n\nis it hyper-independence. yes. is it wrong. not to others just you. chill.", "I am exactly the same i accepted help once big mistake I am a very helpful person I will go above and beyond for anyone and do not expect anything back but after a messy divorce my friend asked me to go drinking and a party I had limited money. I Said no I had other priorities but she kept on and on till i could not longer take her sulking So she said she would spot me \u00a330 we had a awesome night I repayed double the amount and was a free baby sitter for her three kids every weekend  when i say baby sit i mean from friday to sunday morning so she could stay with her partner for a year. When I meet a new partner and would not be baby sitting anymore she lost her mind accused me of being a bad friend and taking advantage of her the irony I mean a year of free baby sitting but I find it hard or even impossible to accept help in any way now and she is still bad mouthing me luckily my friends all knew the situation.", "Your BIL is now in the situation you hate being in. \n\nSo YTA accidentally.", "while i can see exactly why you are how you are, you should work on it. accepting and handing out favours is not = letting people take advantage of you. \n\nNAH", "INFO didnt bil do that to repay you for letting them stay? and now they would \u201cowe\u201d you again?? why did you pay him", "Yeah I agree.  Relationships mean that sometimes you let others do because that what makes them feel fulfilled within that context. Op bought the materials and gave free room and board, and bro wasn't asking for anything in return and likely never would. If op can do favors and not expect anything than so can other people. \n\nOp, if I were you and a situation like this happens again,  just take the gift and assume no strings attached. IF it ever comes back and they try and say you owe then a favor just pay them the money you would have at the time and bam, still the same outcome but you gave them a chance to be kind first and didn't sully a gift immediately. \n\nLook, I understand, I too get taken advantage of and am leaning to pick and choose or just to let it go but you'll breed a lot of resentment from people who truly want to give the gift of service to show they care. There are those people out there and even those that will not hold it over you later in afit of pique. Just accept that not everyone is out to get you or incapable of X, it's not healthy.", "Yeah and now OP has made the BIL the same thing he was trying to avoid. He doesn't want to owe anyone anything, but now the BIL probably feels like he owes OP because he got a free stay *and* paid for his work.", "I'd say YTA, for this particular event, but also in general.\n\nOP: You are overcorrecting because you are afraid to be taken advantage of, like your father was.\n\nYou are seeing \"favors\" as purely transactional rather than as overtures toward relationships of exchange.  (Relationships built on exchange is basic anthropological theory, by the way.  You might be interested in reading some.)\n\nIn a nutshell, people do things for other people not JUST in expectation of payback, but to create bonds of trust and to foster good feelings of relatedness and friendship.  That's what you're overlooking here.  People will see you as cold and suspicious and unwilling to create relationships.  Even if you don't care about that, deep and meaningful relationships require vulnerability. So in the end, you are the one missing out on them.", "On the flip side, why did BIL accept the money? He could of said no.", "This was a hard lesson for me to learn. Let others be nice to you.  It feels good when you help someone out, let them feel good for helping you.  \n\nIt is a kindness to let someone be kind to you.", "If OP didn\u2019t pay it\u2019s just as likely if he says no next time he\u2019ll hear \u201cnot even after I installed all that plumbing?\u201d", "OP is on that Solo Grindset", "Over correcting is human nature but it bodes well that op is here asking for judgment. I sense good things if they're open minded about the responses!", "Except OP didn\u2019t overcorrect really.

OP is not trying to be an asshole, this is just how he\u2019s learnt to handle situations due to watching his father be taken advantage of. Which is understandable but not the healthiest. So NTA but should talk to someone.", "At this point is just seems like OP likes having the upper hand", "> Instead you let him do you a favor\n\nOP didn't \"let\" the BIL do anything, he just did it while OP was out of town. So he either pays him retroactively, or rips the stuff back out and gets in a plumber to do it.\n\nAlso, \"don't do anything to my house\" shouldn't be a rule that you have to spell out when letting someone stay there.", "Like it or not, people will lorde it over you whenever you say \u201cno\u201d to anything if you owe them for something, big or small.

As in, you are refusing the exact thing that you wanted for your father.  \n\nThis makes no sense to the point that I can only assume that this post is fake.", "That makes the BIL the asshole there, and does not reflect poorly on OP at all if that happens.", "OP likes giving favors because it feels good.  OP refuses to let other people feel good for helping them.  \n\nDo you see why this causes an imbalance?", "I'm sorry you've experienced that. I sincerely mean that.

How could that possibly lead to you being taken advantage of?", "Cool you gave up your place for a couple nights for free that really nice of you, while BIL is there he does some easy/available work to help you out knowing you let them stay for free.
