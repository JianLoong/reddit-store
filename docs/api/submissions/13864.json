{"id": 13864, "submission_id": "12a3ogk", "title": "AITA for \"picking a fight\" over my step daughter getting extra drinks throughout the night?", "selftext": "This is an incredibly ignorant argument to me but I genuinely need to know if I'm wrong here. I got together with my husband 6 years ago. I had a 1yo son and he had a 4yo daughter. Both of us had full custody. We admittedly blended our families super quickly but it was never an issue for anyone involved and it worked out quite nicely. My son is now almost 7 and his daughter is almost 11. \n\nThe issue arose as of recently because my husband made a rule years ago that there was only one drink before bed and never throughout the night due to both kids having accidents. I had no issue with this. It was even recommended by the doctor. The issue however is that he is now allowing his daughter to have multiple drinks throughout the night and is still telling my son he can't have one. Neither kids have had accidents for quite awhile but he fully stuck by this rule until maybe 6 months ago but only with my kid.\n\nThis thoroughly pisses me off and I have multiple reasons for it. For one, my son has asthma and his throat/mouth get dry often due to his inhaler. For two, he also sweats way more than I would ever think possible for any child and again, this makes him incredibly thirsty. His daughter has no issues. She simply can't sleep so she gets up to get a drink or she hears us talking in the kitchen and makes excuses to come out \"for a drink\" but just sits there and tries starting conversations with us. She also pounds easily 2 cups every single time she does this so she is up and down no less than 5 times a night to use the bathroom. So, when she just came out to the kitchen to grab a drink, I told her no. Reason being was because my son had just asked for one not even 15 minutes prior and was told no by my husband. My husband asked why she couldn't and I told him (AGAIN, as I've mentioned it multiple times) that I'm tired of him allowing her special drink treatment when my son who has actual reasons for needing drinks is told no constantly. He got pissed and got my son a drink and brought it in to him. He comes back out and says \"There, happy?\" So I said \"That's a start\". However he is now pulling the cold shoulder and very obviously pissed off at me. AITA?\n\nETA: I said it already in my post but some people aren't seeing it.. I HAVE spoken to him several times about the water issue and long before this year alone. I started raising this point over 3 years ago but truly started pushing it when he started allowing his kid drinks throughout the night but not mine. I couldn't raise the issue anymore than I already have. Both kids got a drink. I told my step daughter no but gave her one after he gave my son one.", "created_utc": 1680481589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12a3ogk/aita_for_picking_a_fight_over_my_step_daughter/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You both sound a little ridiculous. I understand not wanting accidents but if the kids are thirsty, let them have drinks. You should nip in the bud when the girl tries to come out to socialize when it\u2019s bedtime.

But I don't see why the son can't go get his own drinks throughout the night. If they daughter can do it, so can he. And your the parent, just get a glass of water or a case of water and put it in your son's room. Problem solved.", "ESH. This is so stupid. Let the kids have water jfc.", "ESH. No reason for your son to suffer from some arbitrary drink limit, especially after he's toilet trained. At the same time, what did your stepdaughter do to deserve her treatment? Nothing, you're just giving her a reason to see you as an evil stepmother. You both need to apologize to both kids.", "ESH. When is the last time they've had an accident? These two kids are WAY too old to not be allowed water. If a kid is thirsty, let them have water. Sounds like they both know how to get out of bed and use the bathroom rather than piss themselves. But denying a kid, especially a kid this old, hydration is horrible. And medically speaking, your body uses a lot of water while you sleep. Sleeping is a time where the body resets itself and heals. Without water, your kids aren't going to be getting the best of sleep.\n\nStop gatekeeping literal water. I have a feeling there's no risks of accidents at this age, and if there are then these kids need to be taken in to a doctor because that isn't normal. And even then, denying someone water for what I'm assuming is 8-10 hours at a time is just... not the answer no matter what.", "ESH\n\nYou both deprived a kid from getting a drink and this rule seems borderline abusive once they're above 5.", "ESH.

It would make sense to ease off for an older child first, but it sounds like the younger kid is thirsty and needs some damn water.", "I'm confused. If your kid's thirsty, and beyond wetting the bed, then either get him a drink or let him get one. I don't understand how it's even an issue. I have a blended family and that's exactly what we'd do.", ">  I couldn't raise the issue anymore than I already have\n\nYes, you could. Or you could at least stand your ground on it.  You've been allowing your son's medical needs to go unmet.  I'm glad you're forcing the issue now - don't let that change.\n\nAs someone else with a dry mouth for medical reasons, I strongly urge you to leave a drink by your son's bed.  I have a cup with a screw-on lid with a straw hole (it's designed for smoothies) and I put a bendy straw in it so I can get a sip of water without having to fully sit up.  They have lots of spill- resistant kids' cup options.  Coach your son to sip water when needed but to not gulp it down so his bladder doesn't fill up.\n\nThe upside here is that he won't have to get out of bed.  He won't interrupt your adult time and he won't have to wake up fully and take a long time getting back to sleep.\n\nYou can give your stepdaughter the same accommodation in the interest of fairness and simple human decency.  Then enforce the \"no getting up after you've gone to bed except for emergencies\" rule.  They may pee and put themselves back to bed, or come to you if it involves vomiting, blood, or significant pain.  Otherwise, they stay in their rooms.  Agree to those rules with your husband then explain them to both kids.  It's really your stepdaughter's behavior that requires these rules - she's playing games at bedtime.  You don't have to tell your husband that.  Just say you have a solution to the bedtime drinks problem that meets your son's medical needs, is fair to his daughter, and will get the kids to stop interrupting both of you.\n\nIf your husband plays favorites in other ways however, you need to try couples counseling and if that doesn't work, plan your exit.  Because this is not fair to your son to be treated poorly in comparison.", "ESH, denying either child access to fucking WATER is straight up abuse. If I saw someone doing this to a child I'd call CPS.", "My son was having the same problem and has asthma.  Now that he does not have accidents, I give him water when he asks for it.  Shame on him.  nta", "ESH. Your husband is an AH. The question is why you didn\u2019t draw a hard line for your son awhile back.

He\u2019s playing favourites. \n\nYour son shouldn\u2019t be denied water if he\u2019s potty trained for his asthma alone.\n\nEdit spelling.", "NTA. I was that kid with asthma and a dry mouth.

Don't be a push over. It's your kid!", "The only thing that remotely made sense to me reading this about the situation, is that maybe the daughter is a little older, and that's why, and then the more I read, the more I realized how messed up this is.

Man, it's a kid, let the kid drink, let the kid be a kid and let him wash the sheets if need be, that's what parents are supposed to do.
