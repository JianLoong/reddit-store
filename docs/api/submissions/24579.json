If he can\u2019t wipe well enough to not leave skid marks, he needs to change up how he\u2019s cleaning himself.

I think the solution to this particular problem is to introduce the BF to the variety of toilet aids available to help people who have similar problems keep themselves clean.

Other people are recommending a bidet and I concur. What I DON'T concur with is recommendations for shaving/waxing, especially since he already has a history of hygiene issues back there. Don't want any infections from cuts/abrasions. Instead, a body hair trimmer with a longer guard (like for beard or pubic hair trimming) should help a lot by keeping things more manageable.

It's also important that everyone else understand that nobody teaches us these things, at least not in America. There are certain things we just don't talk about and that is one of them.
