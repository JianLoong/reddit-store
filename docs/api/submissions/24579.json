He needs to either learn how to wipe his own arse properly, or get some assisting devices to help him. This is beyond gross and unhygienic for anyone who picks up these bits of tissue or finds them lying around. Esp in your own home, and what about at work? Having trails of shit streaked sweaty butt & bollocks tissue fibers dropping from his pants is disgusting. \n\nI'd be putting my foot down to honest. I know it can be difficult if someone's over weight, has mobility or back problems and can't twist or reach easily, but he needs to find another way to deal with this issue. But you have a few issues with him that need dealing with. .... \n\nThe fact he looked at you sheepishly means he knew these bits of tissue on the floor were from him, but he has obviously chosen not to pick them up himself and left you to do it unknowingly as to what they're from. Which is major AH behaviour and disrespectful to you and anyone else whose left with shitty/butt &bollock sweaty tissue drops around their house or work place. \n\nHe needs to either use wet wipes (and dispose in a nappy sack into the bin) or there's some things he get to basically spray rince himself clean with water, then use a wipe or tissue to dry off. Or there's some long handled aids which he can try (although I didn't find that type device worked very well as I tried one when my severe chronic back pain and sciatica was bad and I found it hard to twist or bend, but as a female I now wipe carefully from underneath instead of twisting round) But he could get a bidet or hose fitted to the toilet at home at least or use wipes and tissue to dry off. \n\nHe could also get a separate set of hair trimmers, even like a bikini trimmer and trim his hair down there. It doesn't have to be shaved and irritating, just trimmed to the shortest level so he won't be leaving shit streaks in his pants. \n\nYou need to put your foot down with this. If you see any bits of tissue on the floor, get him to come pick up immediately and clean the floor. If this doesn't work, I'd tell him to go see a Dr because there's obviously a problem. \n\nI'd also be getting him to shower before bed or sex or he sleeps on the couch. \n\nI had an ex who couldn't clean themselves properly due to a weight issue, and whilst I tried everything to be supportive of him, help him lose weight, loved him for who he was (which turned out to be a lying manipulative person who just used me as his ATM) but thats not the point lol. I should have made more of an issue of it because it wasn't healthy or hygienic and if you ignore the problem, or let it go because you don't want them to feel ashamed about it, then you're also not helping the situation and it just carries on regardless. And one problem can often lead to another one. So I'd maybe speak to him and say you don't want to shame him or embarress him, but this situation can not go on the way it is. Its not healthy for him, and it's not respectful or hygienic for you either. Then give him the suggestions I mentioned above. \nJust because he's 'Always dealt with it like this for years doesn't make it right, and he's quite capable of finding a healthier and more hygienic way to manage it that is also respectful and hygienic for those around him. \n\nThere are many different assisting aids and adaptions but if its the hair that's his biggest problem, and not an issue with reaching round to wipe, I'd suggest getting a small bikini trimmer and trimming all the hair in that area, and using wipes that he disposes of in nappy sacks, or look into a home bidet /hose system. He can keep wipes and nappy sacks with him in a small toiletry bag or something at work or use a small portable bottle type travel devices he can use to wash and rinse himself. But he needs to take responsibility and make changes, because his current method is disgusting and disrespect.", "I used to use toilet paper as an impromptu period pad.
