What does taking the cleaning supplies away do to affect her at all? She wasn't using them. I doubt she would even recognize them.", "I get that taking them away isn\u2019t doing much because she doesn\u2019t actually clean. To me if she randomly decided to do so I am not going to pay for it, because she will have to buy things herself in order to do so. I didn\u2019t mention it but I plan on taking other things away and putting them in my bedroom, she is self reliant on me and the things I was forced to buy for the apartment because of her. So taking away those said items might be a wake up call but with her I doubt it.", "But the cleaning would get done. This basically penalizes you. If they\u2019re using the cleaning supplies just for her own space, that\u2019s different.  But keeping her from using other stuff you purchase makes perfect sense.", "I was just about to comment exactly that. 100% lock away the salt & toilet paper and whatever else you share, but you\u2019re really screwing yourself over if she decides to clean but can\u2019t.", "This is petty but..sometimes the only thing that gets their attention is dumping the mess on their bed. I had to do it freshman year. Every time they make a mess and refuse to clean it, dump it in their room. At the end of the lease if it\u2019s still there, snap some pics to show the landlord who to charge and maybe even send it to their parents (if you can find them on Facebook or something). Clearly talking it through with them is not working and their problems shouldn\u2019t become yours", "Hesitant NTA, because she may not actually know how to clean. I've seen college kids who can't use a washing machine. I think there might be more here.", "NTA, but I'd suggest you take ALL your things away EXCEPT the cleaning supplies.", "NTA Do you have an RA you can speak with? It sounds like you\u2019re in campus housing. Have you reached out to try and switch apartments? Maybe there is an opening. Also, everything that is yours should now be moved into your room, don\u2019t share anything with her, she doesn\u2019t respect you and she isn\u2019t your friend so do her no favors.", "Nta.  Move problem solved.  She is not going to change. So why stress over it.  Again move.", "NTA\n\nShe's not doing her part of the agreement and she know that lame excuse is a fake\n\nYou should actually threaten her with leaving the home and let her sink in her own mess", "Like I know she knows where they were she\u2019s just to lazy to actually do it. When I talked to her about it the second time she said she doesn\u2019t want to clean because it\u2019s her job\u2026. we have the same job. I don\u2019t think I want to be cleaning either. I wish I could get a new roommate this late into the semester \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Unfortunately I only have a CA and they cant really do anything in this situation accept to say talk it out which I\u2019ve tried many times already, especially since the apartments are fully booked at my uni.", "Honestly reverse phycology doesn\u2019t sound to bad", "I know it\u2019s a shitty thing to do to start taking other things away from her, but I feel like I have no other choice to make her respect me and my property. I have done almost everything for the apartment and she can\u2019t do something as simple as getting more clorox wipes and toilet bowl cleaner it\u2019s kinda pathetic.", "I wish I could that easily but the school housing contract is way more complicated and it\u2019s fully booked", "Okay but like she complains all the time that when I leave and she\u2019s living here in the summer that\u2019s she\u2019s going to have nothing and is trying to convince me to leave things here over summer.

If she does take it upon herself to clean and in that moment they aren\u2019t there then in all likelihood she\u2019ll give up. There\u2019s taking what\u2019s yours and then there\u2019s cutting your nose to spite your face.", "I wish my situation was easier but she is just simply refusing to clean when her job is cleaning but we have the same job. That\u2019s just laziness", "I 100% understand where your coming from, but to me I told her I was low on things and she agreed to buy them\u2026 a little over a month ago. At this time I am now out of everything I asked her to buy. What I really have left is bleach toilet spray, shower foam, and mop bucket stuff (we don\u2019t have a mop). Even if she wanted to clean she couldn\u2019t really do anything with what I have left. We seem to be fine taking turns with buying things like tp and paper plates but cleaning supplies nope apparently she doesn\u2019t want anything.", "If she decides to clean, she can buy the supplies, it\u2019s not that hard."]}
