All the more reason to behave properly. You're my SIL or my sister so you get to disregard my rule, act like an asshole, AND, AND be disrespectful, but it's OK cause, family. Absolutely not.

Not a day for her to party and let everyone else watch her kids while she uses them as an excuse to complain.", "Hard truth, you sort of both are. She was totally wrong for bringing the children AND trying to change your event to suit her children. It was inappropriate so I\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 sided with you and I\u2019m glad she exited early. \n\nHOWEVER, this is a \u201cpick your battles\u201d type of situation. Its not worth burning bridges. At all. This can be resolved via communication (\u201chey, this is a strictly no children event, and I\u2019m sorry that was an issue but we would have preferred you to stay home if you couldn\u2019t find a baby sitter. the wedding will also be no children so if you would like to attend, it must be in respect to that\u201d). Ultimate, marriage is about hard compromises and making things work for both of you. Causing huge issues within the family is not worth the pride, imo. She made a mistake. Forgive her, dont burn the bridge, and make sure moving forward she understands how to respect you and your fianc\u00e9s boundaries.", "I am assuming that by this, she was referring to Indian weddings and how we generally don't have child-free weddings in our culture.

Thanks!", "NTA, but your fianc\u00e9 needs to be consistent in speaking up for you in this situation/future situations and should deal with the brunt of the blow back, as it is his family causing problems. You also should have a hint of how your future MIL thinks about you given this situation. \n\nYour pre wedding and wedding, so your rules. If you do not want SIL there then your fianc\u00e9 handles it. Fianc\u00e9 and you were disrespected, as the rules weren\u2019t followed. You also cannot get upset if people put up a fight, say they are no longer attending, and etc. Fianc\u00e9s family = his situation to handle and to follow through with. You have a wedding coming up, which is stressful with the planning and etc. This should not negatively impact your celebrations! Congratulations!", "NTA because you had made the rules clear and SIL didn't listen. And bitching about the music being loud? I get it. Indian DJs think they're playing at a nightclub, not a family event. She should have expected the music to be too loud, because presumably she's been to Indian weddings before.\n\nBut... Indian events are rarely child-free. Weddings are family events, and kids are part of the family. She probably couldn't reconcile the fact that this engagement party wasn't following the cultural norms she is used to.", "Nta sil is a huge selfish jerk. Don't invite her to.the wedding.  Who knows what she will pull there. If you let her get away with this behavior you are telling her she can treat you anyway she wants.", "Child free weddings is just not a thing at Indian cultures. I learned of the concept though Reddit- even when alcohol is involved at parties, children are there. Weddings are really much more about the families than the couples themselves here.", "I was confused as well, but the next sentence basically clears it up.", "What type of Indian culture is this \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nNever seen such a marriage......\n\nI If you would have told my sister to leave the place \nI am sure my parents would have kicked my butt in front of people.", "NTA. I can\u2019t understand why parents think kids need to be everywhere at every event. Not every place needs to be kid friendly or allow kids. Also what background is SIL from? From the \u201cturn the Indian music down\u201d it sounds like she\u2019s racist either way. If she didn\u2019t want the music, why\u2019d she bring her kids. I would\u2019ve cranked it up more to see if they would leave because of it. And I\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 was on your side and kicked her out. Being family isn\u2019t an excuse to be an asshole to your family members. That\u2019s the excuse MIL and SIL and the rest of their family is using. I\u2019m all for not inviting her. If she brought her kids to your engagement party I bet 100% she will bring them to the wedding (if kids aren\u2019t invited)\n\n\nPS. I think Indian weddings are so beautiful, I\u2019m sure your wedding will be beautiful", "OP, your fianc\u00e9 hit you, told you he didn\u2019t feel bad because you were in his space, and threatened to cancel the wedding.

On the off chance that you are, start here: 1-800-799-7233", "Funny that most people focus on the fact that SIL brought her kids and ignore the fact that SIL seems to an entitled, racist AH.

This child-free wedding thing is American narcissism.", "Take a normal wedding DJ, crank it up to 11, and you have an Indian wedding DJ.", "Ehhhh, playing Devil\u2019s advocate but my friends who had child free weddings were due to costs. They prioritized having more of their adult friends present instead of the extended families of five. Especially if they had to stick to a budget.", "God agreed- weddings is fun for everyone but the narcissism of the wedding posts sometimes is insane", "I think a lot of it has to do how it\u2019s communicated and those choosing to have child-free weddings not respecting the choice of parents that politely decline to attend. Being respectful of that choice includes not tolerating family being critical of those parents that chose to not attend. Being respectful also means fielding questions like, \u201ccan you refer us to any local babysitters we could use so that we can celebrate your important day with you?\u201d, with grace.\n\nEdit to add; being respectful of choices also means newlyweds need to accept that their choice may impact their relationships with some people in ways they wish it didn\u2019t.\n\nFurther edit to add; I am not absolving the behavior of parents that decline to attend in impolite ways. That\u2019s not acceptable.", "NTA. No one wants to or should have to endure racists. Especially not in their own family. She was rude and didn\u2019t listen. She\u2019s trying to set the precedent that she calls the shots stand up to this now and start as you mean to go on", "NTA. Don\u2019t invite her. Tell your fianc\u00e9 if his family harasses you all about it they will not be invited either.  Go NC with her as she is a racist", "And THEN wanted to dictate music at the event to accommodate her children's needs. NTA op."]}
