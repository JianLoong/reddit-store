I stumbled across a chapter of a group of similarly active women in my area that did workouts and hikes and other sort of gatherings, and I thought I'd give it a try. \n\nThe first time I came, I really liked the other women and would have enjoyed myself, except one of them brought their two small children and it just wasn't enjoyable.

She asked.  You answered.  Your reason was legitimate.  You shouldn\u2019t be forced to be around kids if you don\u2019t want them around.  She was the AH with her response.", "NTA\n\nHow is not wanting to essentially being a group of baby sitters classist?  I ain't rich and neither are most of my mom friends and we don't wanna hang out with kids during girls time.  WTAF!\n\nStart your own KIDS FREE group and send anyone who doesn't like it to that salty group.", "NTA do you have kids? Either way you are not the asshole, but I don\u2019t know how anyone wouldn\u2019t get you POV? Other people kids are especially in.lay annoying when you yourself are free of them for a bit", "NTA  \n\n\nYou'd be a total jerk if you went to those women and demanded that they not bring their kids, but you simply opted out. I've joined groups before and kids are brought along without issue because of the nature of the group, but for others I'd absolutely prefer the company of other adults.   \n\n\nIf she didn't want to hear the answer, she shouldn't have reached out. I doubt this was about checking on you either, it was just fodder for the gossip mill.", "NTA if she didn't want to know the reason she shouldn't have asked. Like you said, it's just not a good match.", "NTA\n\nten bucks says they wish they'd prefer the company of adults too, so they are well salty", "Weird overreaction on her part NTA", "NTA you were not rude to the parent, you simply stopped going because you were not comfortable with the group. They asked why you stopped attending and you answered honestly.", " NTA. Though you probably gave her more information than necessary. You were fairly neutral with your explanation saying that it just wasn't a match for you not that the group was necessarily bad. I got a giggle from the fact you were banned from a group you essentially quit a few months before. I think you dodged a bullet", "NTA. You weren't berating anyone or looking down, you privately acknowledged it wasn't for you and stopped showing up. You told the truth when you were confronted about it. Any anger on anyone else's part is just projection.", "NTA\n\nthey are running a group, she wanted feedback, you gave it", "NTA - she really hit you with the you can't quit your fired lol. I've got a 3 year old, and I 100% don't blame anyone if they don't want to be around that kind of energy.  Especially during an event like hiking.", "\"I quit.\"\n\n\n\"Well you can't come anymore!\"\n\n\n\"...oooookay.\"\n\n\n\nIf it's not for you then it's not for you. You didn't even ask anybody to change what they were doing, you just opted out. NTA", "Absolutely NAH, you don\u2019t owe them an explanation at all to be fair, but giving them honest feedback for why you didn\u2019t feel the group was a good fit for you is completely justified not to mention she specifically asked for it. Obviously you made the right choice in breaking off contact with this group or at least that toxic leader.", "Wow. Of course we only get your side of things and don't know how polite you were about this, but it sounds like a huge overreaction and, as long as you haven't skipped details about your behaviour, you're NTA.", "If everything happened exactly as you described that would be NTA for me. I can imagine that their whole thing is about being inclusive specifically for women who usually don't have many chances to be active together and you left that out but even if that were the case: She asked, you answered. It's just about different interests.\n\nI mean I do get that expecting to not have kids in a group of women is a bit impractical. But banning you when you already decided not to come anymore is... just dumb.", "NTA, she asked, you answered honestly, that she felt personally attacked is on her, not you. My best guess is maybe you should have known the default in women groups is children will tag along, unless is directly specified otherwise. You gave it a chance, it wasn't an enjoyable experience to you and then you moved on to more suitable situation to you and that's fine.", "ETA, I guess. It's true that not everyone can afford healthcare, however going into the group that was for women, I don't think you are wrong for assuming that it will only be women, and maybe go back into it with an open mind or find another group. good luck :)", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t a good fit for you and your reason wasn\u2019t offensive, just your experience. I do think it\u2019s a bit odd that you brought your dog to activities, but think it\u2019s unexpected that they brought their kids.

You like what you like.. your health and well being shouldn\u2019t be disrespected.. especially when ASKED if there was something wrong! Women like that piss me off and it\u2019s just a shame because they are so freaking catty. You\u2019re better off without that bunch.

Even parents tend to enjoy child-free outings at times. Why wouldn't you get to do that? A lot of people do not get child-care, but that does not mean you need to spend your free time caring for their children.", "NTA. Start your own group that doesn't allow kids. There are probably a lot of people who feel the same way you do.", "NTA\n\nShe banned you from a group you quit going to?\n\nBoo fricken hoo! \n\nAre you supposed to beg to be let back in so you don't miss out on a bad time?\n\nShe's got the self-awareness of a kumquat.", "NTA..but she was", "How very dare you not want to join us again, you're banned!", "Haha I don't think I would good at starting this sort of thing.", "Right?! I feel this \u201cgroup \u201c wants to use trending words when it suits them, because they got told the truth. OP is honest about what she feels and wasn\u2019t rude in any way, but they got rude with her really quick! How hypocritical and \u201cinclusive \u201c they are. SMH", "even if we pretend that having kids around isn't annoying for many (most if they're wanting an adult hangout), they have to walk at a slow pace which defeats part of the purpose of the activity completley (the other part being to socialise).", "I do not have kids. I actually joined this group because on their FAQ section it said for 18+ so I assumed, you know, adult women.", " I do think it\u2019s a bit odd that you brought your dog to activities, but think it\u2019s unexpected that they brought their kids.

It's always been sort of a joke between my husband and I about how terrible I am at making friends and to have been \"fired\" from a woman's group has been peak humor for both of us.", "I was as polite as I know how to be because I know kids are a soft spot with a lot of people. I actually kind of danced around the issue at first and just said the group didn't really fit with what I was looking for but she asked why a few times. And even then I really soft balled it in because for all I knew she was bringing her kids at times as well.", "I was expecting there not to be kids because the FAQ for the group said it was for women 18+.", "The FAQ/About section for the group said it was 18+ so that's why I assumed it would just be adults.", "Why is OP an asshole? She never said the other women shouldn't bring their kids, she just didn't go anymore. That doesn't make her an AH. Also it's E S H not E T A", "A lot of the activities were hikes and I asked beforehand if I could bring my dog, even though I had seen pictures of other dogs on their social media.", "Ban me after I quit coming.  Is that supposed to hurt my feelings", "I feel the group leader lashed out because she either friends with the woman who brings her kids or she's angry because other women have dropped out of the the group for similar reasons.", "That makes the reaction all the more weird... I'd get it if they're had some \"empowering women\" thing going on with everyone being welcome - old, young, disabled, kids and dogs and your neighbours pet pony. But if they have rules like this  it doesn't make sense at all", "I hate when people do that.they ask for information or feedback and then get pissed off when they get it. I hope you've found other outlets for your entertainment", "I get it, but as I said it wasn't explicitly stated, you just assumed but that's not on you, it almost reads as false advertising from their part. Also there's entitled parent out there, there's a reason those kids were unruly, lol.", "I thought that OP was an asshole because of her not knowing the reality of the group before joining, who I can't count as an AH upon rethinking it, thank you.(also, I'm new here and don't really know the acronyms, sorry)", "Regardless, you didn\u2019t insult anyone or demand that they change their group rules/dynamics, it just didn\u2019t work for you. The group leader has a chip on her shoulder.", "I was thinking something similar. Or maybe she has brought her kids herself at another time.", "Yeah I am equally confused. LoL. I think this is part of a larger nationwide group so maybe those are the \"group\" rules but each chapter does its own thing?", "I think I'm just going to get a second dog. Two dogs = one person right?", "To my own credit, the group information did say the group was 18+, so that is why I assumed it was just for adult women.", "In my opinion, one dog is greater than four humans but my perspective is a little skewed when it comes to that.  Dogs can be good. Companions for sure", "does your city have just a general local group?   \n\n\nin my city each sort of area has \"local loops\" and even specific girls/women groups for some areas. Lots of people initiate activities.  \nOr you could even find a group that specifically is about hiking in your state/city and find some people there?", "Either way, probably a negligible AH to deserve an ESH", "Ha I wasn't thinking in greatness more just overall mass.", "NTA at all! They sound seriously up their own asses lol. If you're still looking for a new group I'd recommend looking for local groups on facebook and maybe insta. My mom used to go to some when I was growing up and made friends that she ran and stuff with a lot before she got cancer recently and had to stop. Best of luck finding a new group!!", "NTA.", "NTA.  Mom and Grandma here.  Bet they are her kids and people keep leaving.", "NTA. I was all prepared to call you an asshole because nine times out of ten when someone posts here about being honest what they mean is \u201cbrutally honest\u201d and people that pride themselves on brutal honesty are always, without exception, gigantic assholes. The brutality is the point, the \u2018honesty\u2019 is a secondary concern at best. \n\nBut no, you were more like what I would call diplomatically honest. You were truthful but not impolite or insulting. Frankly I found her response to be spectacularly rude; she asked you a question and you answered it, her reaction to that was uncalled for and makes me think she must have brought her own kids to one of these events as well.\n\nDon\u2019t let this experience discourage you, I\u2019m sure you can find some like minded adults to socialize with. As someone who is a bit introverted myself I understand how demoralizing something like this is, but don\u2019t let it get you down.", "Maybe wanna check that in case that group isn't running it the way they're supposed to be and knows it. Might have something to do with her getting aggressive.", "Where are you living? I believe we\u2019d get along great. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. It's entirely reasonable to want to be in adult only groups. \n\nI will say that excluding children from spaces - at a societal level - disproportionately negatively effects women. From a feminist perspective, it's not good to exclude children from social events and spaces, but at an individual level it is absolutely reasonable to not engage in activities where children are present and impact your ability to enjoy yourself. I can imagine that she's heard this societal criticism and may be applying it to an individual but she's TA here, not you", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn't have asked if she didn't want to know. Bullshit it's classist to want to hime with adults, not dawdle along minding children.", "NTA. It\u2019s not childcare and workout. It\u2019s an adult workout group", "NTA and all I keep thinking is what about someone getting that response who might be dealing with infertility issues or some other significant reason for avoiding kids. Not that you need a reason, just knowing the person running the group is responding anywhere from rude to actively harmful.", "NTA you handled that perfectly - it wasn't for you, so you stopped going, and didn't make demands of anyone else.  She could have just said \"OK, best wishes\" and left it at that.", "Well from another feminist perspective it's also not good to assume that any time there's a group of women there needs to be a gaggle of children with them.", "Oh no I hate the \"brutally honest\" troupe. I think things should be said and done with kindness when they can.", "I mean yeah, I guess. The point is that when children are excluded from events and spaces, it's disproportionately women - especially low income, marginalised, etc women - who are impacted negatively. That's not your personal responsibility to address and it's not up to you to be uncomfortable for that reason. It sounds like this woman wouldn't have been able to participate if children were excluded, which sucks and is an example of this societal phenomenon, and all that means is this group isn't the right fit for you. The organiser was way out of line", "Same! I always say \u201cwhy not diplomatic honesty, or compassionate honesty, or thoughtful honesty, or gentle honesty\u201d but the truth is that for the brutally honest the brutality is the main attraction. Half the time they\u2019re not even being honest, just judgmental."]}
