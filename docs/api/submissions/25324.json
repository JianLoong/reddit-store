All of the coffee cups were on the shelves at the bottom. I told her that I know they will get broken. She said she didn't have anywhere else to put them. When we finally decided to let our daughter stay there, a few of the coffee cups were broken instantly. MIL magically found a new place for the rest of them.\n\nThe biggest thing of all is that we would see how she takes care of the kids when we were around. She will get busy doing something else like being on her phone and just ignore the kid. There was a time we were over at her house and we were all getting ourselves ready to leave. I was in the shower and my wife was getting clothes and makeup. My MIL said she would watch our one kid who was 2 at the time. When I got out of the shower and got my clothes on, I walked into the living room and asked where our kid was. My MIL was on Facebook on her phone sitting on the recliner. After a brief search, we found my daughter under my MIL's bed playing in makeup absolutely covered.\n\nThe excuse we always heard from her about why she wasn't willing to make things safer was \"I raised 3 kids and they are all still alive, I know what I'm doing.\" That just doesn't cut it for me.

A man has a girlfriend that is pregnant. For the 9 months of the pregnancy, the man is super excited to be a dad and is looking forward to his kid being born. But then, when the baby is born he discovers he is not the father. Would he be an AH for leaving at that point and refusing to have a relationship with the baby? Like OP, he had wanted to have the relationship when he thought there was a biological connection, but refused when he discovered that was not the case. Like OP, he had yet to form an emotional connection. Why would the standard be different?", "I\u2019m saying this as an adoptee: I think your reasons for calling OP an AH are a mad stretch. \n\nOP\u2019s son and his ex shunned OP for *years* and, consequently, OP never developed any sort of relationship with the child. Nothing in OP\u2019s post or comments indicate that she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to spend time with an adopted kid or a stepchild, *provided* that she\u2019d been given an opportunity to form a relationship with the child instead of being ostracized. As it is, OP 1) barely has a relationship with her son, 2) has ZERO relationship with the kid in question, and 3) truly has no real reason to suddenly play the happy grandparent to a kid she has zero emotional/biological ties to. Would it be \u201cnice\u201d? I guess, but not everyone is a doormat. Sometimes actions have consequences that affect third parties, and in this case, that\u2019s the kid.

The repair in this situation has to start with the son by way of apology. And think about it ops son is an idiot because at this point he could just say it was all ex wife and I am sorry SHE caused this rift between us. Gets what he wants and takes no blame.

Additionally, the fact that you use a demeaning phrases like \"affair child\" to describe the child that the son has essentially adopted and clearly loves just further shows that you, as well as others on this sub, view nonbiological parent relationships as lesser than.

Maybe OP really isn\u2019t a safe person to babysit but now that her son has to be 100% responsible for his kid\u2019s care while she\u2019s with him, his standards for babysitters have significantly dropped. \n\nWe really don\u2019t know why OP was considered unsafe before.

To my mind, there\u2019s a few reasons I can imagine why someone/somewhere more \u201ccountry\u201d could be considered unsafe for children. One potential is a snobby parent or helicopter parent who doesn\u2019t want their child to pick up on habits that are mostly harmless but often looked down upon or questioned by people in big cities. But then at the other extreme we\u2019ve got the potential for a home with firearms, other weapons or dangerous tools within easy access, or the risk of wild animal encounters.\n\nNow either of these options could become less of a concern for parents once the child is a bit older, which might explain the 180 degree change in attitude to OP babysitting.\n\nBut part of me suspects the son\u2019s ex still feels OP is an unsafe babysitter but the son is just desperate and no longer cares as long as someone else looks after the kid for a while.\n\nBut then I\u2019m cynical af, so who knows.", "This.

I was also fine leaving him there when was very young and not mobile.\n\nThere are so many factors that go into whether a space is safe for any given child, and it can change very quickly as the child grows and changes.

Relationships aren't formed through babysitting alone. The fact that OP has no relationship with this child isn't because she wasn't allowed to babysit. It's because she never got to see or spend time around the child either. Family is about more than blood or legality. Just because she is legally this child's grandmother doesn't mean she should be expected to prioritize that bond over everything else after being repeatedly rejected and treated badly.

I labeled what I said 100 times with various versions of \"This is my own experience and may not fit what's happening here\". \n\nEven in the comment you replied to, the only leap I made was to say that \"your house isn't safe because the horses that are in the stables\" doesn't make sense. There just has to be more to the story that we aren't hearing.\n\nSo please, enlighten me on the projecting.", "Also, the kid has no control over the situation and therefore no responsibility for the behaviour of the grown-ups.", "And if anything, the horses would be a GREATER danger becuse a 4 year old is a slippery customer, and much more likely to escape unsupervised.  Sonny is full of crap.", "Maybe the wife was a narcissist and had him locked down? She had a kid out of wedlock on him\u2026", "Let me tell you all the reasons I won\u2019t take my child back to WV unsupervised: \n\n- Guns. Guns everywhere. Never or rarely locked up.\n- Wild animals. There\u2019s a bear cave not far from our property line that we four-wheeled around. \n- Pond with no fence.\n- Another pond with no fence that is inaccessible unless by foot. \n- Poisonous plants.\n- My parents barely watched me, I know they don\u2019t have eyes on my kid. \n- Being exposed to religious, racist, and misogynistic views by people they are suppose to look up to.\n\nSo maybe it\u2019s not just the horses. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nHe doesn't think that you are awful, he can't if he's asking you to be responsible for his child. \n\nIf he does think that you are awful and still wants you to be responsible for his child then that's REALLY awful. \n\nWhat he actually is, is he's very angry with you for INCONVENIENCING him!!!\n\n(He's selfish and unkind, he's self-serving, he's morally in the wrong, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to make this point, whether it falls under the rule of 'no incivility rule, I can delete if necessary?).\n\nHe's a naughty child who's been exposed and he's trying to make it your fault which is quite the act of reaching. \n\nHe's also a massive hypocrite. \n\n\nAll of this being said; how would you feel about drawing a line under this if you're given a genuine and heartfelt apology?\n\nA chance to talk openly and honestly discuss *why* he has some kind of issues with you?\n\nWould you like to get a chance for you and your granddaughter to get to know each other and bond?\n\nShe's probably very curious about her grandma and I bet that you two could have a really lovely relationship.\n\nJust a thought", "your son is petty\ud83d\ude2d", "100% NTA.\n\nYou're right, he just wants you to babysit now because the ex wife is not available anymore. Although using the not-parenthood as an excuse sounds kind of AH, the rest of it sounds correct.", "YRTAH \u2014 You raised the asshole. Not blaming you. It just happens sometimes. Its all about his actions before and not even the biology of the child.", "NTA. Just remind him over and I er that you were told you were unsafe!  Do t even say anything about not being his child. Just they never trusted you and now he does.  Bullcrap!", "NTA. You're allowed to be hurt by their actions and are not obligated to help them out.\n\nWith that said, you sound very nice and I wouldn't be surprised if you eventually change your mind. That's allowed, too.", "If it were me, I would consider that the directive might have come from the ex.

But for OP it is about DNA", "It is about the DNA. OP literally said it is about the DNA and the snub. YTA", "Then don\u2019t include the bit about the DNA?", ">It's not about the DNA\n\nOP kinda made it about the DNA.  OP was 100% within their rights denying to babysit for past behavior.  It's kind of a low blow however to admit part of your reasoning for saying no is just straight rejecting the kid.", "Exactly this. She's NTA about denying him because he denied her first but she is a bit of an AH for bringing up the not biological part.", "I get that it's about the snub prior to the divorce (which seems to be family-wide, not limited to OP), but the phrasing she chose as the title is awfully uncomfortable. \n\n\"AITA for refusing to babysit my grandchild due to her not being my biological grandkid\"? Why would you even bring that up? The child is her son's only child, and she says herself he loves her and has accepted her. So why would she not merely include the information about DNA, but actually list it as her reason for refusal in the title?  She doesn't owe her son babysitting and she can be as salty as she likes about that, but her title makes me think the kid is better off without her.", "INFO: Why did your son feel that you and your family were unsafe for the child to be around, and what has changed that has made you \"safer\" in his view, such as he believes you can now watch the child?", "But OP is saying it is about the DNA. I think they're an asshole for that part of it.", "An ass of a mother raised an ass of a son who could of guessed it.", "Exactly, her sons name is on the birth certificate and stuck around even he found out when they're only related by law and love. I'd be proud as hell as a parent if my son manned up like that, I think OP needs to see a therapist for all the hurt that has happened, but also put her forgiving pants on.", "I thought the same thing. To say it's because the kid isn't biologically related to her comes across as super shitty, especially when it sounds like the crux of the issue is not being allowed to see the grandkid in the first place.", "If she has no relationship with this child then she does not have a grandparent relationship. She\u2019s just some lady that dad wants to dump his kid on.", "Well, you said she didn't mean that but that's literally the reason she stated in the title. \n\nIf we are allowed to speculate I'd say that if the girls was her bio granddaughter she would have eventually throw her pride away and take care of her from time to time. But after feeling casted out **AND THEN** figuring out that the girl is not from her own blood, well, it was too much for her. It's a complicated situation.", "It's not a dick move. OP stated they offered to babysit often but wasn't good enough. Offered to babysit a non-blood grandchild because her son chose to keep the child in his life. But once the divorce happened, she had zero obligation to babysit a child she has no relationship with. His ex-wife made the bed, the son chose to lie in it.", "I don't think a grandparent has any obligation to help parents to take care of their kids. It's natural if parent and grandparent have a good relationship, but no obligation.\n\nIf someone refuses to take care of their grandkid because he is adopted, they are assholes. matches this situation.", "Another big one my boomer in laws couldn't figure out was forcing a child to over eat. My wife and I were very much in support of letting your child listen to their body and if they say they're full let them be done. Boomer culture was to always force the kid to finish their food even if they were full. Kids really don't need much food to be full, in fact I tend to underestimate how much my kid will eat and will dish them up more if they're still hungry. \n\nI remember one time my 3 year old said he was done. I looked and gauged he had eaten a decent amount so I let him off the hook. Immediately my boomer in laws were like \"hey, you need to finish your food.\" I then politely explain how I've examined how much he's eaten and I'm satisfied that he's satisfied. They looked me in the eye, nodded and said \"oh alright. Hey, you need to finish your plate!\" \n\nI just sighed, looked at my son and said, \"you're good. Go play.\"", "It seems like she didn't say it to the son either, but I'd like some clarity about whether she mentioned the child's biology in the discussion with her son.\n\nEdit: I very clearly missed one part of the post. She definitely mentioned the child's biology when talking to the son.", "If the relationship was exactly the same and she called the girl her grandchild when she thought they were biologically related but doesn\u2019t now she\u2019s an asshole. The only thing that changes was a DNA test. Legally it\u2019s still her sons daughter.\n\nI said it\u2019s fine if she doesn\u2019t want to babysit based on previous actions, but to base it on a DNA test if an AH move.", "That\u2019s true. The AH part is when they act like they would have babysat if the baby was blood but since she\u2019s not, fuck \u2018em. \n\nDNA shouldn\u2019t be the deciding factor for if you give a shit about a grandchild.

You're ignoring that OP literally made that her _entire_ title. She put not being related front and center and as if it was the main reason. Just shitty, honestly.", "Even before the edit about why OPs house was unsafe (which is even more relevant now) \n\nHer house was unsafe for a baby that couldn't move around but is apparently safe enough for a kid who gets up and will get into things.\n\nThe esit about it being because they have horses makes this even wilder because a lot of kids are drawn to animals and horses can be very dangerous especially to small kids.", "But honestly, it is for the son to step up and have the talk with his mother. \"OP Mom, we did you wrong. Exmeena didn't like you or my family and in the interest of my marriage, I went along with it. I am terribly sorry for the ongoing hurt I caused you. How about I come down this weekend to visit with Little Miss and we start to get to know each other (again).\"\n\nBabysitting talks come afterwards.

She watches her other grandkids no issues from her other kids finding her home unsafe.\n\nHorses makes sense on why she says she is country, (and her son looks down on his country siblings).", "Wow, you get an B+ for fiction.  None of what you wrote explains why the son and his now ex wouldn't bring the child for holidays when they would be there. Why he didn't even try to have OP establish any relationship with the child.  I don't know why you want to make OP a villain for not having a connection to a child she was never given the chance to know.", "This makes the most sense to me. OP even said the dad still loves the kid, knowing they're not his. That's your grandchild if that's the case. I think ESH.", "That\u2019s upsetting. I\u2019d be so unbelievably proud if my kids had jobs like those one day. My family was very white collar and it was hard to get them to understand the joy my husband and I have for physical labor and outdoors. I\u2019d be very upset if my daughters looked down on those jobs or their family", "Yea this is much more my experience being from WV and moving to DC.
