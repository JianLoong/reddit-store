Yeah, there's no emotional connection there but that's his fault too.  However, you saying you wouldn't babysit because she's 'not your grandkid' is a total AH thing to say.  I have a 16 year old stepdaughter that I've been raising since she was 7.  My family treats her as if she were our own flesh and blood and has since the day they met her.  And both of you suck because you seem to both fail to realize that none of this situation is the kid's fault, yet she's really the one that's suffering because of it.  Both of you need to grow up.", "It really boils down to this question....if she was biologically your sons, would you now babysit?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then YTA - softly, but you are. Your son has made peace with the DNA result and decided to be her father regardless.  You really should follow his lead.  \n\nIf the answer is no, then NTA - they treated you poorly, and now your son is crawling back because he needs help.  That said, it would be good to discuss with your son and see what his true drivers were.  If his ex had someone else's baby, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch for me to believe she manipulated him in this regard, too.", "NTA\n\nThe 4 years he spent bonding with his daughter that made him choose to raise her even without her being his biologically, you didnt have those, so for you shes just a random kid.\n\nStill i think you should try bond with her, she will be in your life 4ever, and i guess now she will be present in family events and such. And who knows, for someone who cheated and made someone raise other dudes daughter, it wouldt be that hard for her to be manipulating him to stay away from you and your family, i would give him another chance, imagine what he is going through now, things must be terrible for him rn.\n\nYou said he had doubts, does he knew she cheated sometime before he did the paternity test and isnt the bio dad envolved? Idk, maybe in the future he will try be present in the girls life", "NTA\n\nYou would have been fine with raising a kid that wasn't yours if your son didn't prevent that.\n\nNow, he expects you to help him raise a complete stranger because he decided to?\n\nYeah, no. What he did was insulting and he needs to realize that he messed up before coming back to you.", "NTA although I think you could have worded it differently, as your reason isn\u2019t DNA it\u2019s the fact that he never allowed you when you repeatedly asked but now that he actually needs it from you suddenly everything is deemed safe.", "ESH: Your son is entitled but you're an asshole for bringing biology into this at all.", "INFO: What are the missing missing reasons?", "100%.\n\nIt's about his treatment towards you, and basically not allowing you to be this kids grandparent by refusing to spend time with you.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit: Typo", "Honestly I feel like she is an AH for saying it\u2019s because the kid is not a bio kid. Not babysitting when she wasn\u2019t allowed before is A-OK, but saying \u201cshe is not my grandkid\u201d is a huge AH move.", "That's not what OP says though. To them the kid is not family. So I'd say ESH.", "Overall NTA, I do think your reasoning for saying no should have ONLY been about how they didn\u2019t trust you before, so why trust you now.", "Absolutely this. ~~Overall N T A, but the reasoning is poor to say the least.~~\n\nThe reason given here is hurtful. What I mean by that is I have a daughter from a previous marriage and a son from my current marriage. If my mother in law said this about my daughter \\[not biologically my husband's\\], I'd be crushed. If my former mother in law said this about my son, I would also be crushed. I'm quite close to both of them and neither treat the non-bio grandchild as unwanted or not family.\n\nEdit: for rating and reason\n\nYTA OP... I saw what you said about that child and it's unacceptable to treat a child that way. Blood related... you serious??? Eff that. I've been on the receiving end of someone that only deals with blood family and it's unpleasant and hurtful!!!", "I really don\u2019t want to, maybe it was the ex but he really messed his relationship with his whole family. It really did seem like he was looking down for us having country jobs. My daughter is taking over the ranch, my youngest son is a mechanic and my middle child is working as a park ranger.", "It looks like they were married when they had the kid so it's very likely he's on the birth cert and doesn't need to adopt. Also why he'll still be on the hook for the child support payments.", "He said the horses were unsafe but those are in the stables and I\u2019m not going to take a  ride with a baby on the horse.\n\nThe house is good even if a little old, the only place I would say it is unsafe is in the cold cellar but we keep that locked. It\u2019s a typical ranch that\u2019s he grew up on.", "I have made no changes, I really think it is due to not being able to rely on his ex wife anymore. He claimed the horses were dangerous but I\u2019m not taking a baby on a horse ride and they are in the stable most of the time. The house is fine, only dangerous part is the cold cellar but that is locked.", "NTA.  He messed up.  This might not be the case, but just because some people have raised kids don\u2019t mean they were good parents or will be good babysitters.  It\u2019s perfectly valid for a parent to want to make sure an environment is safe for their child, but he sounds like his wife was making that choice for them.  I\u2019m sure you made sure everything was safe.  I think the ex looks down on you because you live in the country.  Now your son needs you and doesn\u2019t want her so his tune has changed.", "100%", "Agree. Had she stopped at not wanting to babysit since they didn't want her help before it would have been ok. But the \"she's not mine biological\" is an AH move.", "I wasn\u2019t good enough to look after the kid when he thought it was his bio daughter and now that he know it\u2019s not his bio kid, I am now good enough. Thats messed up.\n\n no relationship with the kid due to him and now I don\u2019t have any biological reason to want a relationship. It\u2019s just a random person to me at this point. I have zero ties to her.\n\nNow if I did have a relationship with the kid before that whole mess I probably would think of her as my grandkid, but I didn\u2019t.", "That's not the point. There's no relation to this child, no emotional bond or biological connection. If it was a biological grandchild then there would be a reason to get to know it even though the son only wants to use OP.

My husband and I were declared \"city\" folk because we chose to move to a Suburb of a city because thats were the work was. We made so much effort to get out and see the family. They looved to make it be known we were city folk (fyi- we both grew up in the \"country\" and loved our experience). Have they visited us? Not one bit.

But, since this one isn't mine, you can see her now.\" \n\nYou don't get to choose when someone bonds with your kid and then expect them to do what you want without consequences.", "Why is OP the AH for not wanting to look after someone who is biologically not their grandchild? Add the fact that their son never let them babysit in the past when all was right in the world, why is it on OP to be the bigger person? They're essentially strangers, it would be weird to have anything to do with each other now.", "The other kids mentioned is OPs, the siblings to the son who now wants her to babysit. I read it as the son didn't allow his siblings to meet or babysit the child either and now have a strained relationship to his whole family.", "It's confusing, but she meant that son won't let HIS siblings, i.e. Emma's aunts and uncles, babysit. No one in his side of the family can babysit.", "I don\u2019t blame her, their is no emotional connection due to the son and now their is not a biological obligation either.\n\nAlso it sounds like he just want to use her for babysitting now since he can\u2019t handle raising a kid alone.

Its out of line for him to think just because he has gotten a divorce that it will automatically grant him forgiveness for the way he has treated his family while married.
