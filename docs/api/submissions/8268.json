They are unfit parents.", "Please pay, give your sister the opportunity to leave your parents and experience her own life. An 18 year old shouldn\u2019t miss out on education because your parents decided to have a baby. She\u2019s lucky to have you.", "NTA\n\nYour parents decided to have a baby.   Not your sister.  Your parents' choice to have a baby does not mean that your sister must become their unpaid, enslaved nanny. \n\nWhat will your sister do, five or ten years ago, when the baby no longer needs care?  Will your parents then pay for college, and tutoring to help her get back academic skills that atrophied while she was their child's caregiver?  Or will they turn around and call her a slacker and mooch for \"living off them\" rather than going to college and getting a job?\n\nHelp your sister escape this enslavement and have a secure future.  \n\nThe baby is your parents' responsibility, not your sisters.", "YWNBTA I was raised by a mom who was denied an education, heavily parentified and dreamed of going to college until she finally did in her mid 30s. You would be giving your sister the greatest gift. Her parents need to take accountability for their own actions and children.

Your parents got your newborn sister. it is their role as parents to take care of her, not your older sister's job. She should be getting the chance to do what she loves. SO if you can help her with that, that would be very kind of you and absolutely not an asshole move. (Shows that you're a great big brother for her that you want to offer this to her! Please do, but in a way that your parents can't stop you/ your sister.)", "NTA  \n\n\nSounds more like you are a damn hero and deserve praise.", "NTA. You are a great brother.

Favourite person on the internet right now.", "NTA. Don't go to college because we decided to have another child? I think that was their choice, not hers.

Your sister is her own person, not a live-in babysitter. Your parents chose to have another baby, neither you nor your sister need to pick up their responsibilities. If you're willing to pick up the tuition shortfall she needs then go for it.\n\nAlso advise her to secure her important documents like birth certificate, passport, social security etc so they can't be held hostage to keep her there. Separate her finances from your parents, change banks if she share so they can't sabotage that. She has a future beyond that house, she deserves to live it.", "NTA, your parents, now that a different story. They are attempting to make your sister responsible for the care of their child, it is called parentification, and it is wrong.

Your parents a terrible. They can take care of their own damn baby wtf.", "Take her out the house she needs to move in with you they want a free babysitter. I hate parents like this you are basically asking for them not to like you. Save her they are messed up", "NTA. Your parents seem to forget that your sister also has her own life.

WTF? Get your sister out of there. That being said, just be ready for the fallout. Sounds like you\u2019re not missing out on much with parents like that though.", "Absolutely NTA. You would be the absolute bestest sibling ever if you paid for the rest of her tuition!\n\nWere your parents always this dismissive of education and independence? Babysitting your youngest sibling isn\u2019t going to further your sister\u2019s education or help her get a job and move out. Do they really expect her to put her life on hold for 16-18 years? That\u2019s so unfair.", "You would be doing an amazing thing. YWNBTA!  How dare your parents expect her to put her life on indefinite hold to be free child care for them! Please do everything in your power to help your sister.", "NTA your sister is 18 so you can create your own relationship with her, you do not need your parents permission anymore to talk to her, see her, or offer her a home with you. What they are trying to do is make her be an unpaid nanny/maid. That is financial abuse and practically slavery if they are stopping her from leaving. Help her get away from them.", "NTA. Your parents can hire a nanny if they need help. It is not your sister's child and she shouldn't be held back because they are assholes.", "You WNBTA at all. You would be the nicest brother in the world to her. Your parents are major, major AHs for trying to ruin your sister's future. Is it her baby? No?

That newborn baby is your parents responsibility, not your sisters.", "Is this a \"second wife\" type situation?  a 27 year gap between you and your new sibling is unusual.  NTA for helping your sister get into her dream school.  Your parents can use that money they saved not helping their child go to college to pay for a nanny.", "NTA.\n\nYou would be the asshole if you have the ability to help your sister, the will to help your sister, and decide not to help her because of your parents.\n\nShe's an adult now. Your parents have no say in what she gets to do. What matters here is what she wants to do, and what you have the ability to do.\n\nYour parents chose to have another child; your sister presumably did not force them to create it and carry it to term.

Do this for your sister, and she is 18 so that means she is an adult where you live i assume? She can make that decision herself, the only thing your parents can do is to guilt trip her into staying.
