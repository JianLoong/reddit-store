The funeral was real as I saw multiple pictures of the service from mutual Facebook friends of hers. And she was there for longer because the service went longer than expected and she was asked to go to the repast\n\nMy wife and I have two children, a 4 year old and a 6 year old. Our 6 year old is on the autism spectrum. It goes without saying that this is a very stressful position and neither of us get very much of a break from this. My wife is a SAHM and I have a full time job. \n\nAs happy as our children make us, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish for us to both desire breaks. We get them every here and there but we made a deal to have 2 guaranteed breaks in a year. Our birthdays, and mothers/Father\u2019s Day.\n\nOn those days, the one parent takes on the brunt of the burden so the other can get a day to relax. Since our youngest was about 2 we practiced this. I have never failed to give my wife the day off she deserves. I\u2019ll schedule her a spa day, or something she really wants to do and get her out of the house so she can relax while I\u2019m on daddy duty. Then when she gets back our kids give her cards and gifts, and we get a meal from her favorite place after they go to bed. My wife has been less consistent and doesn\u2019t really do as much as I do for her. The last year she hasn\u2019t really done anything.\n\nI typically try not to hold it against her as it is undoubtably hard, but it does feel kind of unfair. This Father\u2019s Day, I planned something for myself as she made no indication of doing something for me. I warned her a week an advance and she said it was okay.\n\nThis was until about 3 days ago. My wife\u2019s old boss\u2019s dad passed away. She was invited to the funeral by the boss and she chose to attend the funeral which was about 2 hours away. As a result I had to cancel all of my plans and take care of the kids. She was supposed to be home at around 5 in the evening but didn\u2019t arrive until around 10. The kids were already asleep and my wife neglected to help them get a even Father\u2019s Day cards for me.\n\nWe got into a huge argument when she got back. I told her that i felt like she really dropped the ball on this and didn\u2019t give me a break like I usually do for her. She told me that she\u2019s home with the kids all day just about every day and I only have to help out after work and as far as she\u2019s concerned I regularly get a break and she doesn\u2019t. I told her working isn\u2019t a break and that I really was looking forward to today. \n\nShe said that someone died and I was being completely selfish to make it about me. I said that it was someone she didn\u2019t know who was the parent of someone she hasn\u2019t seen in over a year and I didn\u2019t think I was being selfish in asking her to prioritize my needs just as a gesture like I do hers.\n\nShe\u2019s been pissed at me since and were not talking.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: \n\nMy wife is not sleeping with her boss. Her boss is a married gay man", "created_utc": 1687171217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14db1r8/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_prioritize_me_for/", "score": 9999, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one is invited to a funeral a day before the viewing/ burial. Furthermore she has been slacking on the commitment in prior holidays. She\u2019s being selfish and now pissed because she\u2019s was called out for being such. You BOTH decided on children. They are hard work and she chose to be a SAHM.

Did she communicate this with you at the time or just arrive home at 10pm? Would you have been satisfied had she returned at 5 as expected or were you already salty about her attending the funeral in the first place?\n\nETA: Based on answers provided elsewhere I'm gonna go with ESH. She didn't need to be 5 hours late. She chose to go to dinner with her boss, effectively taking a break on a day initially intended so her husband could. She could have attended the funeral and still returned for you to enjoy your evening as planned. And to not even get you a card from your kids is understandably incredibly hurtful. \n\nI do, however, think that attending a funeral is generally a fair priority, even if it's to support another attendee and not necessarily because of a close bond with the deceased. Keep in mind this person was burying their Father on Father's Day. That's a very cruel twist of fate indeed. \n\nYour relationship may have bigger problems but your Father's Day plans can still be salvaged.

Could she not have asked a family member to watch the kids? Did either of you try and find a sitter for the day? \n\nAlso also, why was she so late getting back from the funeral?\n\nEDIT: going with NTA, as per my response to OP answering my query.", "NTA clearly she only went to the funeral to get a break from the kids.\nit's only fair that next Sunday you get to take the day off for yourself since you didn't get to do it on father's day.", "NTA\u2014 A deal is a deal. She didn\u2019t need to go to that funeral, totally understandable if she sent flowers instead seeing as it was on a holiday", "This is screaming to me that your wife wants \u2018adult time\u2019. You get to converse with your colleagues everyday; she doesn\u2019t. She has you to socialize with and \u2026 is that it? Does she go out with friends? Without the kids?\n\nTo me this seems like she jumped at the chance to socialize with people she knew and could have adult conversations with. \n\nSeriously think about and ask her if she\u2019s really happy being a SAHM. She may miss working and the social aspect that comes with it. \n\nI think this is an ESH situation. But really you both need to communicate better.", "Based on your post, if you regularly felt valued, or if she hadn't failed to meet your expectations on other Father's Days, I think you'd be willing to give her a pass because of the funeral. But the fact that the kids didn't even have a card for you means she made no effort before the funeral, either, and as someone who has been both a sahm and a full time worker, her comment implying that work is your break is deeply disrespectful. And why was she not back until 10?\n\nI don't think your feelings are really about Father's Day, but that your wife doesn't treat you with respect in general. \n\nPurely for getting mad at her attending a funeral, ESH, but it sounds like the day to day AH may be your wife.", "NTA.

I bet she\u2019d be livid.", "NTA. Your wife had plenty of time to plan something for you, arrange child care if needed, etc. and at the minimum could have been home by five. Both of you need breaks from your responsibilities and if that means hiring a sitter once in a while, even just so the two of you can run errands together without the kids, then it would be worth it.\n\nIt\u2019s very weird to me that she went to the funeral of a father of an old boss who she apparently hasn\u2019t talked to in a long time, and even weirder that she stayed for so long.", "NTA- for the simple fact she could have just talked to you and changed the day because of her prior commitment.

This is a grade A communication/relationship problem. \n\nAt first I was leaning towards the idea of \u201cman, it is a funeral. Those don\u2019t happen all the time, and depending on the relation it may trump your Father\u2019s Day plans, but former boss\u2019 dad (unless they were really close for some weird reason) isn\u2019t the relation I would have expected. Based on her response she clearly went to this as a break from the kids and justified it to herself by saying you get breaks from the kids daily when you go to work. \n\nRaising kids is hard.

And y'all saying she is being selfish have clearly never been a SAHM or had caregiver burnout before.", "Was it solely her decision to be a sahm? I'm asking because in a lot of cultures women are pressured by the in-laws and extended family into leaving their jobs and becoming a sahm. I've witnessed it happening to people. It builds up resentment which some women carry their entire lives. I can see how someone who regrets leaving their job may passively lash out like this sometimes.", "NAH. This doesn't sound like you're upset about Fathers Day, it sounds like you are upset about not having time off. Funerals are not movable, but you could time shift to have off another day. \n\nHaving young children is generally hard. Having a developmentally challenged child is even more difficult. It is normal to want time away. Are your children in school or full-time at home still? What's the breakdown of childcare and household tasks on a daily/weekly basis?

But why did you wife feel the need to leave all day? Is she struggling at home alone with the kids? Are you two actively talking about the load she is coping with. 2 breaks  a year is not much.

This is definitely a shitty situation, but Father\u2019s Day is yearly. There\u2019s always going to be a next one, but it seems like the funeral and death of the boss\u2019s dad was sudden.

Even if it was, it\u2019s a *funeral*. Someone passed away, which doesn\u2019t happen yearly and is just *once*, and you can always set up your plans for the next week; it doesn\u2019t strictly HAVE to be on Father\u2019s Day. \n\nI think though you should talk to your wife about the efforts made on Father\u2019s day; if this is a yearly thing that happens where you don\u2019t really get to celebrate it, it would be good to hash it out to find a compromise that makes you both both happy.", "I don't see the problem here. I mean you can reschedule fathers day to another day this year. There is no reason fathers or mothers day has to be celebrated the exact day when its only about getting a break from the kids and not special stuff you can only do on this exact day. So the solution would have been \"sure hon, i'm just moving my fathers day to sunday next week, no biggi.\"\n\nAlso i would recommand you guys a specialised child care and your wife getting at least a part time job. This sounds like an incoming burnout and being around small kids 24/7 as an adult is draining.\n\n(And also i'm sitting here wondering why in all the posts of americans at least one person is depressed, one person has a serious mental health disorder and whenever there are kids at least on of them is on the spectrum.

Our 6 year old is on the autism spectrum. It goes without saying that this is a very stressful position and neither of us get very much of a break from this. My wife is a SAHM and I have a full time job. \n\nAs happy as our children make us, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish for us to both desire breaks. We get them every here and there but we made a deal to have 2 guaranteed breaks in a year. Our birthdays, and mothers/Father\u2019s Day.\n\nOn those days, the one parent takes on the brunt of the burden so the other can get a day to relax. Since our youngest was about 2 we practiced this. I have never failed to give my wife the day off she deserves. I\u2019ll schedule her a spa day, or something she really wants to do and get her out of the house so she can relax while I\u2019m on daddy duty. Then when she gets back our kids give her cards and gifts, and we get a meal from her favorite place after they go to bed. My wife has been less consistent and doesn\u2019t really do as much as I do for her. The last year she hasn\u2019t really done anything.\n\nI typically try not to hold it against her as it is undoubtably hard, but it does feel kind of unfair. This Father\u2019s Day, I planned something for myself as she made no indication of doing something for me. I warned her a week an advance and she said it was okay.\n\nThis was until about 3 days ago. My wife\u2019s old boss\u2019s dad passed away. She was invited to the funeral by the boss and she chose to attend the funeral which was about 2 hours away. As a result I had to cancel all of my plans and take care of the kids. She was supposed to be home at around 5 in the evening but didn\u2019t arrive until around 10. The kids were already asleep and my wife neglected to help them get a even Father\u2019s Day cards for me.\n\nWe got into a huge argument when she got back. I told her that i felt like she really dropped the ball on this and didn\u2019t give me a break like I usually do for her. She told me that she\u2019s home with the kids all day just about every day and I only have to help out after work and as far as she\u2019s concerned I regularly get a break and she doesn\u2019t. I told her working isn\u2019t a break and that I really was looking forward to today. \n\nShe said that someone died and I was being completely selfish to make it about me. I said that it was someone she didn\u2019t know who was the parent of someone she hasn\u2019t seen in over a year and I didn\u2019t think I was being selfish in asking her to prioritize my needs just as a gesture like I do hers.\n\nShe\u2019s been pissed at me since and were not talking.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You may even have travel time to decompress. With one of your children being autistic and the other so young I doubt she has even a moment to herself.

When the kids are asleep I will be the one tidying up, cleaning and making sure everything is ready for appointments/events/the next day. Even for seeing friends or family or going out, she is still having to be on the ball all the time for the kids. It\u2019s a different kind of stress and perhaps one she is having problems with. It can make her resentful without her knowing it and she may even feel like she\u2019s a bad mother for saying anything. \n\nPlease communicate with each other and take some time to explain how you both may be feeling and then you may be able to take steps to help and support each other.", "YTA", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re both selfish people who see family as a chore.\n\nGet over it and move on.", "YTA\n\nYou can reschedule your Father's Day celebrations/break.

Especially when he makes an effort for mother's day. I'd feel a bit aggrieved in his shoes too.", "I agree with this. OP, the difference is what you\u2019re considering a break. Your wife is considering any break from childcare a break. Often this is something as small as going grocery shopping alone. This is why she\u2019s saying that you get a break every day by going to work. What you\u2019re talking about is a break from all responsibility.\n\nYou need to consider these as tier 1 and tier 2.\n\nTier 1 is more important, it\u2019s the change of responsibilities. It\u2019s you coming home and taking care of everything child-related while she takes care of other responsibilities. This *needs* to be met before you can address tier 2.\n\nTier 2 is a legitimate break for both of you when you\u2019re off the clock. *This needs to happen more than once a year!* That\u2019s not even close to enough time to recharge and help with burnout and you\u2019re both feeling that. To start with, split Saturday. Each individual gets 6 hours of time so whatever the heck they want. 7-1pm and 1-7pm. This can be going out or staying in and watching Netflix with noise cancelling headphones. It doesn\u2019t matter. They are off the clock and for all intents and purposes *not to be bothered*. Because you\u2019re at work all week I recommend your wife get the first shift of 6 hours to herself so she has something to give the second half of the day.\n\nAlso, plan nights in. Give the kids macaroni and cheese for dinner and grab takeout for yourself so no one has to cook or cleanup. Watch a movie together at the end of the night. Anything that takes 0 effort right now is what you want. You can build up to doing more later. If you\u2019re up for it, try to bring little moments of thoughtfulness back. A card left on the breakfast table saying you love her and hope she has a good day. Bringing her favorite chocolate bar home. A back rub at the end of the day *with no other expectations*. (I realize these are geared toward you but generally it starts with one person and the other picks up on it).\n\nI\u2019d also recommend a therapist. You can even do phone calls if you don\u2019t have the time to go out.

It also sounds like she's the default parent. This isn't to say that you don't help as much as possible, but your autistic child is likely more reliant on her and more expressive to her because she's the primary safe zone. (As someone who's helped raise 2 autistic cousins) This means that your wife likely deals with more behaviors then you do. I'm sure she's fighting between the love of her children and the ease of being in a structured job. \n\nThe way she went about this wasn't fair to you. But all of her failures to get letters for fathers day and plan things for you sounds like she's overly mentally taxed.\n\nHonestly sounds like you both need to work on your relationship. As a couple you need to find a better way to split the household duties. Things like meal planning, homework, cleaning the house, grocery prep, lunch prep, children's clothing prep, cooking dinner, keeping tract of household needs, taking care of pets, schedule tracking, laundry, bills paid, earning income, etc... Typically as a stay at home parent 90% of the invisible labor gets put on you and more then 50% of the physical labor. I'm not saying this to belittle or berate what you do for your family. Earning money is important. This is simply a reminder of all she does daily and how that often means she doesn't get a 15m or 30m break in her day.  If the kids are in school she's probably spending that time getting things done that become much more difficult with the kids in tow like grocery shopping, meal prep, and house cleaning.\n\nRecent studies show being a stay at home parent is really the equivalent of taking on the duties of 3-4 full time jobs and often working 90-120 hours a week. I'm just trying to give perspective because it's difficult to have a good perspective on how much work that is until you do it. \n\nI have two under two right now. He has two days off a week from his full time job and I take those same days off from my business as much a possible.

NTA for sure", "agree. I have some coworkers I\u2019m close to that I\u2019d go to a funeral for them/their family. Or at least the viewing/wake. But unless they were close like family, this was just an excuse.", "First\u2014it\u2019s very unusual to have a funeral on a Sunday, and especially on a day like Father\u2019s Day.  I am questioning that, unless there was some unusual circumstance.\n\nSecond\u2014it\u2019s possible that wife and her old work team were a close, tight-knit group.  Perhaps this boss\u2019s dad was a regular volunteer or mentor for the group, the wife, etc.  OP doesn\u2019t give any context aside from the fact that wife hasn\u2019t seen old boss for a year.  We don\u2019t know how close wife and boss\u2019s dad were (without suggesting in any way that there was an inappropriate relationship).\n\nThird\u2014I don\u2019t condone wife ignoring Father\u2019s Day for her own spouse and father of her kids, not even getting him a card from the kids.  She  knew about his plans in advance, agreed to them, and at the last minute told him she was going out of town on the day when he\u2019d already made plans, for the funeral of someone who wasn\u2019t even a close family member.  She didn\u2019t even arrange childcare so that he could still follow his plan.  This seems highly inconsiderate.\n\nFourth\u2014OP seems to feel that since wife is a SAHM, she somehow has it easier than he does, who has a full time job.  He also doesn\u2019t indicate where the 6-year old falls on the autism spectrum (which is fine, he is allowed to have some privacy).  My point is that if the child is nonverbal or requires major help in eating, dressing, bathing, or toileting, the wife as a SAHM has far more than a full time job caring for him or her.  No matter how much parenting OP does when he\u2019s home, she has the lion\u2019s share of that.\n\nOP says that until the past year, they have both given each other their two days off each year, but that she\u2019s never been as consistent as he is.  Perhaps she is burnt out and worn down by her work at home.\n\nESH is my verdict.  If wife truly did cause OP to cancel his Father\u2019s Day plans that she\u2019d already agreed to, in order to attend an out of town funeral on Father\u2019s Day (even if that was really true and nothing shady was going on), she was definitely in the wrong.  OTOH, I honestly think OP isn\u2019t quite being fair in (apparently) thinking his wife has it easier because she\u2019s a SAHM.  He wants to believe he\u2019s being so generous and giving her a break, but I wonder about the day-to-day grind.  She may be massively struggling.\n\nOP, it seems to me that you and your wife need to take a full day off together and try to have a real conversation.  Daily life as a busy parent with kids doesn\u2019t give much time to build your couple relationship.  Can a grandparent or trusted sitter give you two a day?  I urge you to make this attempt, if you want your marriage to survive.  In fact it would probably be healthy if you could arrange a child-free \u201cdate\u201d at least once a month.  Understandable if it\u2019s difficult to get a sitter for your child on the autism spectrum.  But it\u2019s also something that may be helpful for her/him to have more contact with adults who aren\u2019t the parents.  If you don\u2019t have family or trusted adults who could sit, the school system may be able to put you in touch with resources.\n\nWishing you the very best.", "I want to preface by saying I completely agree with you but in the back of my head I\u2019m also wondering why we even really care what an old boss she hasn\u2019t spoken to in a year does or doesn\u2019t understand lol\n\nA flowers and a card is more than sufficient for the situation, hell I think that\u2019s even a little excessive for an old boss.\n\nI mean she\u2019s a SAHM, with a 4 and 6 year old, when\u2019s the last time she even worked for him??", "And I feel like the OP is downplaying the relationship because the boss wouldn't invite her if they didn't have some sort of relationship (and I don't mean romantically).\n\nI have someone who is an \"old boss\" who i only see a couple times a year. She hasn't been my boss in over a decade, but we text here and there and keep track of each other's lives and again meet for dinner twice a year.

So if someone else were to describe this relationship to other people, they could technically say \"that's her old boss\", which is TRUE, but obviously that relationship has  been extremely important to me and I would drop everything to go to her in her time of need. \n\nThe fact that OP's wife was \"invited\" to the funeral tells me more about the relationship. You don't invite random former employees.", "I\u2019m surprised she even got a an invite. I\u2019ve been close with coworkers but after not talking to one for over a year I wouldn\u2019t expect an invite to their fathers funeral. Hell I wouldn\u2019t expect an invite to my current coworkers fathers funeral despite talking to them daily at work.

She thinks she's working a full time job (which she is, tbf let's be real, stay at home parenting is in fact a job, albeit with unpaid labor) which  OP only needs to help out when he comes home from work. So she has it in her head that she's more overworked than her husband who \"only helps\" and is most of the time just out having a grand old time at his deskjob, and is therefore entitled to not provide any emotional labor for him (planning stuff for him on important dates like his birthday and Father's day for example) cause hey, who keeps the ship running 24 by 7 365?

Also people think that being a SAHM is easy, because they don't have to go to work everyday, but that's usually not the case. It's very hard because work and home are the same place and she is \"at work\" 24/7. Splitting the saturday is an amazing idea to both give the breadwinner as the SAHM the time they deserve.

Except your not. \n\nHaving a special needs child can be stressful and daunting. You work full time while she stays home. I\u2019m going to assume that you weren\u2019t an arse and pressured her to stay home with the kids. \n\nIt is natural for a parent to want breaks. We may be adults but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need time to decompress. Taking this time is important. It allows you to decompress, relax, and come back in a good mindset and ready to continue instead of constantly being overburdened and getting short tempered because of it. \n\nThe system y\u2019all set up is good. I would have added at least 1 date night in there a month where a babysitter could watch the kids for a couple hours so you can get much needed time as husband and wife. \n\nThe fact you go all out planning her day down to reservations at the spa is amazing. Major props to you there. You do this every-time. But for some reason your wife doesn\u2019t. She hasn\u2019t been consistent and for the last year she hasn\u2019t done anything while you have gone all out. I get why you feel that it is unfair. Because it is. \n\nSadly, you plan your own Father\u2019s Day this year since she wont. You remind her and she said okay. Then 3 days ago her FORMER bosses DAD passed away. It isn\u2019t even the former boss. It is his dad. \n\nHere is where some things just completely don\u2019t make sense to me. It isn\u2019t someone she knows. And why would a former boss invite their former employee to their family members funeral when the former employee never even met the guy? They are having a funeral on Father\u2019s Day. On a Sunday when a lot of people are in church. The funeral is being held 2 hours away. She was suppose to be home by 5. Which means she was leaving there at 3. But instead she arrived home after 10 which means she left there at 8pm. \n\nShe didn\u2019t even bother getting you a Father\u2019s Day card. That part really bugs me since Father\u2019s Day is on every single calendar and she had plenty of time to plan and pick up a single card. She already is unfair and is inconsistent but this is beyond that. \n\nWhen she gets home all hell breaks loose. You were annoyed at everything that transpired and felt neglected by your wife which is very valid. Then she shows some bitterness and resentment saying that you get a regular break by going to work/only having to help on evenings/weekends and she doesn\u2019t even get that. \n\nYou point out working isn\u2019t a break: because it really isn\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure of many people who consider working a break. Usually we get our break when we come back home and relax before doing it all over again. But you don\u2019t get that part. She is showing bitterness and resentment that you get to work outside the house while she is stuck taking care of the kids all day. She tries to guilt trip by saying someone died. You point out it wasn\u2019t anyone she knows. \n\nThere are a lot of red flags there my man. I have doubts she really went to a funeral. Your special needs son is 6. Unless she is homeschooling, he should already be in school during the day. Generally special needs kiddos start in the public school system a year ahead of everyone else and begin in pre-k. I know because I have special needs children myself. \n\nIt might be time for her to get a job and y\u2019all look into childcare for the kids during the day. It sounds like she is super resentful of the fact that you work. But I am also concerned that she really isn\u2019t in this marriage anymore just by things you have said. \n\nI hope everything works out. NTA.", "This is kind of trivial, don't think anyone is an A-hole.  Why don't you reschedule your day off and move on?", "NTA for being disappointed about Father\u2019s Day, but honestly, it sounds like your wife needs a BREAK. She probably used the funeral as as an excuse to have a day off. She\u2019s right that you do get a break from the kids every day at work; she doesn\u2019t. Can you help her with some respite care or get someone else to watch the kids on occasion? She sounds like she needs it.", "This stinks a little of unreliable narrator here.  Everyone is harping on the fact that it's \"an ex-bosses father,\" but the fact that she was invited and went to the funeral 2 hours out of town makes me think it was probably a close friend. Both relationships can be true at the same time, but (\"ex-bosses father\") serves the OPs objectives more.\n\nI don't think OP is T A because he should be able to get his father's day special moment as they had planned. I do think there is more going on.  I imagine being a SAHM with a special needs child all day everyday takes a toll and if the wife feels like she needs to jump at every legitimate reason to get a day away, then maybe you need to work out more breaks for her.  Being at work is not a break insofar that OP is not doing his share, but it is a change of scenery, an opportunity to deal with rational adults (in theory), and in all respects a break from the very challenging home life that OPs wife doesn't get. \n\nI suggest you call a do-over on father's day, and then have a real discussion about more support for your family so you both can feel replenished.", "ESH\n\nYou two have an agreement and your wife did not honor that agreement. She also prioritized a seemingly insignificant (to her) event over you and the kids on a family holiday. For that specific situation I would say she didn't behave ideally.\n\nBUT from her reaction, I suspect there is more going on here. You work and your wife is a SAHM. So while you are at work, your wife is the sole caregiver and manages your household. Once you get home, her job ends as well. Now you are both equal parents in their free time that need to take care of their kids and their home. I suspect that's where you are TA and don't take on as much responsibility as you should. I also suspect the mental load for your family is entirely your wife's. \n\nIf I were you, I would stop pouting and sit down with your wife to make a plan on how to better this situation. Define times when you both work and when you are both off the clock. Assign responsibilities. And don't make her the manager of the house and just \"help out\". Take charge, know your stuff. What size clothes and shoes do your kids wear? Who are their doctors and when is the next appointment for what? What are your kids' friends' names and when are their birthdays? Keep a calendar or a shared document with your wife so you can get up to speed to really step up and do your part.\n\nAnd then, maybe next year, you'll deserve a better Father's Day and she'll be way less stressed and able to organize something for you instead of grasping at a far fetched opportunity to get out of town for a day.", "Some INFO here:\n\nYou work outside the house and your wife works in the house.\n\nDo any of your children go to daycare or your wife has to watch both of the children all day long, on top of the other house chores? \n\nWhen you get home from work, how are chores and child responsabilities divided?

I'm going to say this because both of your issues have nothing to do with you getting your day off or at least partially the issue. Communication seems to be the biggest one.\n\nYour wife is the asshole for acting like you get a break from the kids because you go to work. That's not how that works. If you go to work for 8-10 hours and she's home with the kids for 8-10 hours you both are working.\n\nWhen you get home that's when you both should take on the slack for the remainder of the time. So if you have 6 hours you both should be splitting it accordingly or, at the very least, being helping each other out. As long as you aren't acting like you need a break from work while she gets nothing I see nothing wrong here.\n\nI will admit that she was gone for a pretty long time. To me she was probably using that as an excuse to get away. That's fine. But when you communicate this to your wife you should say you deserve a redo for your day off plus an additional one because of how long she was gone for.\n\nYou're the asshole because, whether it's someone she knew or not, she really wanted to go to it. I don't see why you can't just adjust the day that you take your break. Why does it have to be father's day specifically? Unless it was something that had to happen that day... just move it. It's not like she is just blowing it off and staying home. She had a reason. Part of going to funerals is being there for the people that are living. And I'm going to assume she and her boss were close or friends of some kind.\n\nBut another reason you're the asshole is because you do all these things for your wife and while you say it's not a big deal that she doesn't do similar you clearly are holding a grudge.

The event makes it quite obvious that you both are tired of your kids and your jobs. \n\nMaybe you need to get a nanny or a few days a week or at least make some plans a few times a month. Send your kids off to a center that can accommodate ASD during the day. \n\nTry to find some time that both of you actually got time to yourself; whether it was 20 minutes in the car or 20 minutes in your room by yourself. \n\nMaybe make Mother\u2019s Day less of a big deal; it doesn\u2019t sound like she wants to celebrate things on the level that you do.", "I dont think you are telling everything.

Your wife stays at home, and you generate income. Although it isn\u00b4t exactly the same in terms of work, both are expected to put their 40 hours towards their pre-agreed roles, and then all extra time outside these 40 hours are to be split equally. I understand she may feel she doesn\u00b4t get a break because she doesn\u00b4t exactly leave her \"place of work\", but both of you are entitled to your down time when you are done with your 40 hours, and both of you are expected to do your share. That doesn\u00b4t mean you get a break and she doesn\u00b4t, and it also doesn\u00b4t mean that you need to look after the kids and she doesn\u00b4t because she has been doing it all day already. You looked after them as well by generating income that I am sure she is also using to do her part.   \n\n\nWhat I am trying to say here is that both of you are entitled to your breaks and both of you commit your 40 hours for the family and I don\u00b4t believe one is worth more than the other. All the extra work outside those 40 hours should be equally divided, and so does leisure time.  \n\n\nI think expecting some effort for Father\u00b4s day is then also very reasonable and I would be upset as well if nothing happened. Even in the event of a loss, regardless of how close the person is to your wife, she could have at least moved Father\u00b4s day, or in some way acknowledge this.   \n\n\nBut the nuance I would give it is that now there 2 issues, one is her forgetting/ignoring Father\u00b4s day, which is not only really disappointing coming from your wife, it is also not respecting your need for a break. You can have that discussion with her and you are definitely not the AH there. The second issue however, is you holding going to the funeral against her. She is right to say you are selfish, but on that part alone, because you care more about your day than about what grief she may experience and you are kinda holding it against her.  \n\n\nThat being said, you are right for being disappointed in her IF she didn\u00b4t offer you to have your day off another day. There is very little she could do about her former boss dying, but what she can do is reschedule.  \n\n\nAlso, and this is none of my business, but seems you two need to talk a bit more about your roles at home. On paper your roles should be equal once the work day is over, doesn\u00b4t matter who has the more difficult role, you are entitled to your leisure time, and so is she. If you feel that she is having more leisure time during the day and doesn\u00b4t do certain chores so you can do them, address them as well.", "NTA.

I don't want to pass judgement here because it seems that you both have a lot of issues. She is a SAHM with 2 children. I assume that while the children are in Kindergarden/School, she is still taking on the brunt of the mental work that comes with running a household and especially with running a household with neurodivergent children.

Take a vacation from work and be the SAHP for a week. Send her off to a park, or the library 9-5 for a full week, and switch places. Day 1&2 won't be too bad, but by day 5.......

I started this job to get a break from caring. \n\nIs your child with additional needs at school? If not, I am not surprised if she is completely burned out (and I would say the same if it were you at home all week instead). This is not standard parenting as you undoubtedly know.

That's still contributing and is just as meaningful as every hour OPs wife spends at home while he is at traditional work. Work often requires mental, emotional, social and sometimes physical labour.

I hope I'm wrong...but if your wife is subconsciously looking for reasons to not be around you or one/both kids then that will lead to more painful neglect and I recommend having some \"friend of a friend\" counselor or psychologist attend a BBQ to observe and advise on what they think you may need if anything...", "NAH\n\nSure, you had a right to expect she'd keep her side of the agreement. You aren't an asshole for expecting that. \n\nYou might a bit of an asshole for not recognizing the crisis that your wife is in at the moment.\n\nShe's clearly been checking out, by not going to near the effort on  your special days as you do on hers. She's perfectly aware that the difference is noticeable and she was saying something with that. When you didn't pick up on the clue, she said something more forcefully, by using this funeral as a way to fuck up your day.\n\nOf course she didn't need to go to that funeral. What she needed was to have the argument with you afterwards, she needed to say the things she said and didn't feel she could bring them up some other way. We don't know, as you haven't told us, but maybe she's already brought them up numerous times and they fell on deaf ears. Maybe she doesn't feel she *can* bring them up. Both are clearly problems.\n\nYour wife is at her breaking point and you are going to lose her if you don't help her make a change. She needs a break from your kids. She probably needs her own job, even if it is only part-time. If you don't help her get those in your marriage, she'll end up getting them outside of your marriage while you pay child support and/or alimony.\n\nEnd of advice, beginning of speculation - you know most of this already, don't you?

In that case, they both need a break...", "OP have either of you considered therapy or couples therapy perhaps?

SAHMs sometimes perceive any time away from the kids as a break because to them it is, hence you getting to go to work and converse with adults etc., may not be appreciated in the way you would hope or expect. If I had to guess, she is burnt out from spending nearly every waking moment looking after the kids which has caused resentment to build up towards you. Be mindful of this, try your best not to respond with resentment even if it is unfair, the most important thing to remember is you are on the same team, if you don't understand where eachother are coming from try not to get defensive or retaliatory, be empathetic, open, and work together. I sense you may need to be the main facilitator for this because you seem to have more energy and it sounds like your wife really needs you right now. It's hard not to be selfish when you feel as low as your wife is likely feeling.\n\nJust two \"days off\" a year for either of you is not enough, and although it's perfectly healthy to give your partner a break by looking after the kids, I think it's important for you to get days off together to appreciate each other and spend time as lovers, not parents. Easier to say than do of-course, without family that can support you or affordable child care it can feel you are stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Maybe both of you can work and be with the kids roughly an equal number of hours each week instead of them being separate responsibilities.

It's complicated, but both of you could potentially start sharing each other's responsibilities to help even it out. \n\nIf I understand correctly, and I'm totally not trying to knock on you for something here, I'm a guy I get it man, but your current situation has you being the traditional male breadwinner of the family, nothing more or less than is expected of most good fathers (and you seem to be doing an awesome job with that!), while she is not just an average SAHM, but she has to deal with a child on the spectrum all day, every day for 363 days a year. That's like SAHM at the maximum expert difficulty level, and often results in hidden depression and stuff. Meanwhile you still get the opportunity to be able to interact with normal grown ups on a daily basis, maybe she just missed experiencing that and got swept up in the opportunity. I wouldn't take it too personally if I were in your shoes. It's just these kind of flaws that make us human. \n\nTLDR; neither of you is the asshole. Both of you sound like wonderful hard working parents whose lives revolve around their kids primarily. I would suggest ACTUALLY stepping into each other's shoes so you can see each other's point of views. Let her work half of the week instead of you while you stay at home. Maybe she'll see how valuable your role of putting food on the table is, maybe you'll see how many absurd hoops she has to jump through everyday to keep your house together. \n\nI'll also add that it is very, very important to remember to not completely get lost in your raising your children.
