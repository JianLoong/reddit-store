Our 6 year old is on the autism spectrum. It goes without saying that this is a very stressful position and neither of us get very much of a break from this. My wife is a SAHM and I have a full time job. \n\nAs happy as our children make us, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish for us to both desire breaks. We get them every here and there but we made a deal to have 2 guaranteed breaks in a year. Our birthdays, and mothers/Father\u2019s Day.\n\nOn those days, the one parent takes on the brunt of the burden so the other can get a day to relax. Since our youngest was about 2 we practiced this. I have never failed to give my wife the day off she deserves. I\u2019ll schedule her a spa day, or something she really wants to do and get her out of the house so she can relax while I\u2019m on daddy duty. Then when she gets back our kids give her cards and gifts, and we get a meal from her favorite place after they go to bed. My wife has been less consistent and doesn\u2019t really do as much as I do for her. The last year she hasn\u2019t really done anything.\n\nI typically try not to hold it against her as it is undoubtably hard, but it does feel kind of unfair. This Father\u2019s Day, I planned something for myself as she made no indication of doing something for me. I warned her a week an advance and she said it was okay.\n\nThis was until about 3 days ago. My wife\u2019s old boss\u2019s dad passed away. She was invited to the funeral by the boss and she chose to attend the funeral which was about 2 hours away. As a result I had to cancel all of my plans and take care of the kids. She was supposed to be home at around 5 in the evening but didn\u2019t arrive until around 10. The kids were already asleep and my wife neglected to help them get a even Father\u2019s Day cards for me.\n\nWe got into a huge argument when she got back. I told her that i felt like she really dropped the ball on this and didn\u2019t give me a break like I usually do for her. She told me that she\u2019s home with the kids all day just about every day and I only have to help out after work and as far as she\u2019s concerned I regularly get a break and she doesn\u2019t. I told her working isn\u2019t a break and that I really was looking forward to today. \n\nShe said that someone died and I was being completely selfish to make it about me. I said that it was someone she didn\u2019t know who was the parent of someone she hasn\u2019t seen in over a year and I didn\u2019t think I was being selfish in asking her to prioritize my needs just as a gesture like I do hers.\n\nShe\u2019s been pissed at me since and were not talking.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1687171217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14db1r8/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_prioritize_me_for/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one is invited to a funeral a day before the viewing/ burial. Furthermore she has been slacking on the commitment in prior holidays. She\u2019s being selfish and now pissed because she\u2019s was called out for being such. You BOTH decided on children. They are hard work and she chose to be a SAHM.

(What funeral lasts all day and most of the evening)  tbh you need to check to see if anything else is going on, as it is shady as hell.\n\nBy doing this she has shown that she doesn\u2019t respect you, or what you do for her. So stop doing it.\n\nNo more planning stuff for her birthday or Mother\u2019s Day, help your kids make her a card, or pick out a present, but that\u2019s it.\nWhen she complains tell her that as she doesn\u2019t even do this much for you, she\u2019s lucky she gets anything at all.", "NTA but also, I\u2019d be questioning why she had to go to this funeral for some one she doesn\u2019t know. Even not speaking to the person who lost their dad in a year. Sounds sus to me. She also sounds like she takes advantage.

You working is not a break, for to suggest that is a dick move", "Going to need some INFO: \n\nWas your wife close with her boss and the father? Does seem a little weird for her to attend the funeral. However, I would like to know their dynamic. \n\nAlso, do you and your wife have contingency plans for when you need someone else to watch the kids? Could she not have asked a family member to watch the kids? Did either of you try and find a sitter for the day? \n\nAlso also, why was she so late getting back from the funeral?", "NTA clearly she only went to the funeral to get a break from the kids.\nit's only fair that next Sunday you get to take the day off for yourself since you didn't get to do it on father's day.", "NTA\u2014 A deal is a deal. She didn\u2019t need to go to that funeral, totally understandable if she sent flowers instead seeing as it was on a holiday", "This is screaming to me that your wife wants \u2018adult time\u2019. You get to converse with your colleagues everyday; she doesn\u2019t. She has you to socialize with and \u2026 is that it? Does she go out with friends? Without the kids?\n\nTo me this seems like she jumped at the chance to socialize with people she knew and could have adult conversations with. \n\nSeriously think about and ask her if she\u2019s really happy being a SAHM. She may miss working and the social aspect that comes with it. \n\nI think this is an ESH situation. But really you both need to communicate better.", "Based on your post, if you regularly felt valued, or if she hadn't failed to meet your expectations on other Father's Days, I think you'd be willing to give her a pass because of the funeral. But the fact that the kids didn't even have a card for you means she made no effort before the funeral, either, and as someone who has been both a sahm and a full time worker, her comment implying that work is your break is deeply disrespectful. And why was she not back until 10?\n\nI don't think your feelings are really about Father's Day, but that your wife doesn't treat you with respect in general. \n\nPurely for getting mad at her attending a funeral, ESH, but it sounds like the day to day AH may be your wife.", "NTA. Because of what everyone said, but also ask yourself this. What would her reaction be if the roles were reversed? And you skipped out on mothers day for an old boss\u2019s dads funeral. I bet she\u2019d be livid.", "NTA. Your wife had plenty of time to plan something for you, arrange child care if needed, etc. and at the minimum could have been home by five. Both of you need breaks from your responsibilities and if that means hiring a sitter once in a while, even just so the two of you can run errands together without the kids, then it would be worth it.\n\nIt\u2019s very weird to me that she went to the funeral of a father of an old boss who she apparently hasn\u2019t talked to in a long time, and even weirder that she stayed for so long.", "NTA- for the simple fact she could have just talked to you and changed the day because of her prior commitment. The fact she didn\u2019t do anything makes her TA.", "NTA\n\nOld bosses dad? And she didn\u2019t come back at 5 with take away and a bottle of wine for you to chill while she took cAre of bedtime!?", "NTA. She knows what she did. But instead of admitting that she\u2019s stressed out by being a SAHM and could care less about the funeral, but went so she could have an entire day off, she\u2019s doubling down. \n\nYou mention that she didn\u2019t even bother to get cards or put together a gift bag so clearly her priorities have shifted when it comes to you both giving each other special days off. And arguing that you get a \u2018break\u2019 by going to work to provide for your family is short sighted. \n\nBeing a no-show on Fathers Day was mean and by not making arrangements for you to be able to have some time for yourself the entire day (play date for the kids/sitter, etc) she\u2019s showing you exactly how she feels.", "NTA Your wife wanted a break and used the funeral as an excuse \nShe had plenty of time leading up to the day to help the kids at least make a card for Fathers Day and if she was legit apologised and organised something on a different date.\nIt's not someone even close enough to warrant going to their funeral so there's more to this!", "NAH\n\nWow, you two have a lot on your plate and none of it easy. This is a grade A communication/relationship problem. \n\nAt first I was leaning towards the idea of \u201cman, it is a funeral. Those don\u2019t happen all the time, and depending on the relation it may trump your Father\u2019s Day plans, but former boss\u2019 dad (unless they were really close for some weird reason) isn\u2019t the relation I would have expected. Based on her response she clearly went to this as a break from the kids and justified it to herself by saying you get breaks from the kids daily when you go to work. \n\nRaising kids is hard. Raising kids when one has a disability is even harder. You two need to work on communication and expectations and operate as a team. \n\n\u201cFighting For Your Marriage\u201d - it is a good book on how to communicate and better deal with hard issues in a marriage.

But You aren't wrong for expecting her to plan something on Father's day, but she is clearly burning out being a stay at home mom.The funeral was for an ex bosses parent, she didn't need to attend. She saw an opportunity for more down time, which she desperately needs, and took it.", "Was it solely her decision to be a sahm? I'm asking because in a lot of cultures women are pressured by the in-laws and extended family into leaving their jobs and becoming a sahm. I've witnessed it happening to people. It builds up resentment which some women carry their entire lives. I can see how someone who regrets leaving their job may passively lash out like this sometimes.", "NAH. This doesn't sound like you're upset about Fathers Day, it sounds like you are upset about not having time off. Funerals are not movable, but you could time shift to have off another day. \n\nHaving young children is generally hard. Having a developmentally challenged child is even more difficult. It is normal to want time away. Are your children in school or full-time at home still? What's the breakdown of childcare and household tasks on a daily/weekly basis? Do you have a long commute that makes your work days longer than 8.5-9 hours? \n\nIt sounds like your wife is doing the majority of childcare, household tasks and perhaps isn't getting regular time off. If you have a long commute, while stressful in it's own way, is also time spent not directly contributing to income or family support. It sounds like the immediate need is for you and your wife to hire a sitter or drop the kids off with trusted family and have a night off _together_. You guys need time to talk this through and see how you could both support each other better and work through how to free up some time each week for you to do your own thing. \n\nSeriously though, you guys need some time away w/o the kids.", "Idk it's hard here but I think you're both lightly the asshole.\n\nCompromise is a huge relationship saver and she could've been like \"hey, gotta go to this funeral but I'ma give you Tuesday off instead for father's day\" or whatever works with y'alls schedule to give you a break and make you feel loved and appreciated.\n\nI feel like you messed up cause she went to a funeral of all things and you were upset about it lol. If it were ANY other event I'd say you weren't. But even if it has been a while since she's seen her friend and she may not have known their dad very well, she still went to support them in hard times which was sweet of her.", "#1 predictor of divorce is contempt for the spouse.", "NTA. But this is not about fathers day or the funeral. You need to sit down and talk. She seems overwhelmed by taking care of your kids 24/7 and you feel like she isnt respecting your agreement or making you feel special.\n\nAs a mother having stayed at home and worked, I can tell you that being responsible for a child 24/7 is alot. When I started working it was for sure a break for me because I got to be an adult, having other kinds of demands and responsibilities for a few hours, going to the bathroom in peace, getting a lunch break, getting a break to and from work everyday and so on. You two live very different lives and you need to help each other, not work against each other. And to do that you need to understand each other.", "ESH (but mostly her)\n\nYou're acting like attending an employment-related funeral two hours away was some sort of *spa day* for her. I'm sure she'd rather do just about anything else. \n\nThat said, it does look like she dropped the ball for Father's Day, since \"the kids\" never even gave you a gift or a card. That should have already been organized, even if she did, last minute, have to leave the kids with you. \n\nAnd, if it were me, under similar circumstances, I would have issued a raincheck. \"I'm *so* sorry but they scheduled the funeral for *Sunday* of all days.

Your expectation that she not attend a funeral so you can do something on your own is selfish. However, I think it's hella rude that she didn't organise so much as a card from your kids and that she was 5 whole hours later than initially stated.

I\u2019m sorry you were disappointed in your day but perhaps communicate and ask for a do-over day! \n\nAlso, yeah work is a break when you\u2019re a parent. Being a SAHP is 24/7. Your work is your home-your home is your work. Getting out of the house, getting to speak to adults about adult things, the commute-glorious!! I know work is work but at least you have a separation between work and home. You regularly get a break from your kids, presumably 5 days a week, she gets twice a year and 50/50 when your home. \n\nSigned off a parent of a special needs kid who has been both a SAHP and a working parent.", "NTA.

She needs to make this right.", "ESH\n\nI would have suggested if she was unavailable to move fathers day to Saturday. Ultimately you want a balanced relationship and if an event has been missed it should be made up for.\n\nOn a separate note I would also suggest talking to your wife about what each of you expect on those days. Make sure you both do what the other asks (within reason of course) and aim to do as much for them as possible.\n\nI think you and your wife are soft AH because her response getting home was not empathetic like yours also. Someone dying is extremely sad and you both wanted empathy but had none to give each other.", "ESH- Agree that she should have put more effort in for Father's Day and made some point to give you a make-up day. \n\nThere was a funeral, so I think you should be somewhat forgiving about that- she can't control the day it's scheduled. I will say I think she may have used it to get a bit of a break. If she has the children 7 days out of the week, plus taking care of the home and meals all day, she's probably exhausted and wanting to see/talk to other adults.  \n\nCheck in to see if she needs some time off. She may be feeling a bit resentful.", "YTA Someone died. Only happens once in their lifetime. Where's you're compassion?

Is she happy being the SAHP? Are you happy with being the sole provider? Is it possible to increase  time for you two (alone and together)? Maybe with a babysitter?", "She just didn\u2019t care. She resents you for working while she can\u2019t and instead of communicating, she decided to get back at you in a downright despicable way.

Spend time in each others company without the kids distracting you, fall in love again! That way you both get a break", "ESH. I think wife was enjoying the adult conversation. I\u2019m sure on one level being with the kids all day can be draining. Husband should have asked for additional day of fun freedom day.", "YTA.

Funerals only ever happen once, you get to have Fathers day every year. Think about it !", "YTA. Fathers day is yearly, funeral only happens once. Also, your kid having autism has absolutely nothing to do with the story and if you added that info as a fucked up attempt at gaining sympathy, you're double the asshole.", "YTA\n\n  \n\n\nYou handled this poorly, to be clear you are specifically looking for a break from the children despite your wife being the primary parent\n\n  \n\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting so \"me time\" but it doesn't have to be on a specific day, she couldn't help when a funeral would be held.", "This is hard to judge because i'm thinking that any of the judgements apply when looking from different viewpoints.   \n\nI want to go with YTA though.  Your \"Father's Day day-off\" doesn't HAVE to be on Father's Day.  Communication is desperately needed here.  You could have arranged to celebrate with your \"day-off\" next weekend or any other day.   \n\nFunerals are for the living, so even if your wife didn't know her former boss's dad it does seem odd for her to go support him/her if they didn't have a relationship outside work.  That was making me lean towards E S H.       \n\nParenting doesn't ever get a legit day-off though.  And i see why it sucks big time to expect to relax and be pampered, and some dead guy just ruins that for you.  This is what almost made me vote N A H.   \n\nYour wife sounds burnt out though, bub.

Or, since your wife had a funeral, can they feasibly be moved to next weekend, so you still get your day? A little flexibility would not go astray here. \n\nAlso, I strongly suspect your wife does not feel that you contribute as much as you think you do at home. You get to get out and away from the day in, day out stress, while she does not. You might want to consider that, and see what can be reworked in the day to day schedule.", "I'm going to go with ESH. \n\nIt reads as this is much more than about missing fathers day. You and your wife really need to sit and down and have an actual discussion about shared duty and what you can both do to make it easier. Is outside help needed?\n\nGoing out all day for a funeral of someone you don't know, not even bothering with any kind of fathers day things, is a real asshole move on your wife's side. But why did you wife feel the need to leave all day? Is she struggling at home alone with the kids? Are you two actively talking about the load she is coping with. 2 breaks  a year is not much. It sounds like you could both do with an actual break. Is respite care available?", "Not sure why you are asking but yes, YTA", "[removed]", "YTA. This is definitely a shitty situation, but Father\u2019s Day is yearly. There\u2019s always going to be a next one, but it seems like the funeral and death of the boss\u2019s dad was sudden. Even if you warned her a week in advance about your plans and she said it was okay, the timeline doesn\u2019t matter in this because it wasn\u2019t like the funeral was planned since that week ago. Even if it was, it\u2019s a *funeral*. Someone passed away, which doesn\u2019t happen yearly and is just *once*, and you can always set up your plans for the next week; it doesn\u2019t strictly HAVE to be on Father\u2019s Day. \n\nI think though you should talk to your wife about the efforts made on Father\u2019s day; if this is a yearly thing that happens where you don\u2019t really get to celebrate it, it would be good to hash it out to find a compromise that makes you both both happy.", "I don't see the problem here. I mean you can reschedule fathers day to another day this year. There is no reason fathers or mothers day has to be celebrated the exact day when its only about getting a break from the kids and not special stuff you can only do on this exact day. So the solution would have been \"sure hon, i'm just moving my fathers day to sunday next week, no biggi.\"\n\nAlso i would recommand you guys a specialised child care and your wife getting at least a part time job. This sounds like an incoming burnout and being around small kids 24/7 as an adult is draining.\n\n(And also i'm sitting here wondering why in all the posts of americans at least one person is depressed, one person has a serious mental health disorder and whenever there are kids at least on of them is on the spectrum. Doesn't this concern you? What the hell is going on down there? Are you guys eating nuclear waste that messes up your genes or something?)", "I frankly find Mother's and Father's Day a bit silly (and yes, I am a parent, before anyone makes that comment) so ,based on the title, I came here SUPER ready to deliver an a-hole verdict but....\n\nWell. My prejudgment was wrong. Your wife clearly doesn't value your contributions much anymore. It kinda sounds like the stress of her undoubtedly challenging life is taking its toll and she's misdirecting that frustration at you, OP.\n\nAnyway, all that to say: NTA", "NTA.  Your wife didn't even try or act like you deserved anything.  I'm sorry.", "Edit - being a stay-at-home mom for a high needs child with autism is the aspect I would imagine is difficult and isolating.  I was a full-time assistant for a mother with such a child for a period.\n\nSoft YTA.  She gave up a lot by becoming a stay at home mom for a high needs child. Her boss's dance funeral was an opportunity to see her old co-workers and have some reminder of a social / previous life she is cut off from.\n\nHer argument that she is the only one performing full-time child care and therefore the only one that needs a full day break from the kids holds some validity.  So does yours - working is not a break.  But I imagine her life is very isolating and difficult given the circumstances.  \n\nMaybe the two of you can find ways for you both to take breaks or even take breaks together more often.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Our 6 year old is on the autism spectrum. It goes without saying that this is a very stressful position and neither of us get very much of a break from this. My wife is a SAHM and I have a full time job. \n\nAs happy as our children make us, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s selfish for us to both desire breaks. We get them every here and there but we made a deal to have 2 guaranteed breaks in a year. Our birthdays, and mothers/Father\u2019s Day.\n\nOn those days, the one parent takes on the brunt of the burden so the other can get a day to relax. Since our youngest was about 2 we practiced this. I have never failed to give my wife the day off she deserves. I\u2019ll schedule her a spa day, or something she really wants to do and get her out of the house so she can relax while I\u2019m on daddy duty. Then when she gets back our kids give her cards and gifts, and we get a meal from her favorite place after they go to bed. My wife has been less consistent and doesn\u2019t really do as much as I do for her. The last year she hasn\u2019t really done anything.\n\nI typically try not to hold it against her as it is undoubtably hard, but it does feel kind of unfair. This Father\u2019s Day, I planned something for myself as she made no indication of doing something for me. I warned her a week an advance and she said it was okay.\n\nThis was until about 3 days ago. My wife\u2019s old boss\u2019s dad passed away. She was invited to the funeral by the boss and she chose to attend the funeral which was about 2 hours away. As a result I had to cancel all of my plans and take care of the kids. She was supposed to be home at around 5 in the evening but didn\u2019t arrive until around 10. The kids were already asleep and my wife neglected to help them get a even Father\u2019s Day cards for me.\n\nWe got into a huge argument when she got back. I told her that i felt like she really dropped the ball on this and didn\u2019t give me a break like I usually do for her. She told me that she\u2019s home with the kids all day just about every day and I only have to help out after work and as far as she\u2019s concerned I regularly get a break and she doesn\u2019t. I told her working isn\u2019t a break and that I really was looking forward to today. \n\nShe said that someone died and I was being completely selfish to make it about me. I said that it was someone she didn\u2019t know who was the parent of someone she hasn\u2019t seen in over a year and I didn\u2019t think I was being selfish in asking her to prioritize my needs just as a gesture like I do hers.\n\nShe\u2019s been pissed at me since and were not talking.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The missing unplanned time is fishy too. 5 hours late...? What was she doin, bc funerals dont run 5 hours late", "To me it sounds like the real problem isn't her attending a funeral, but the lack of her acknowledgement of your contribution to the household is. Work is not free time. If she sees it this way, it probably means she is struggling quite a bit. Talk to her about the situation at home and see if you can come up with a solution that's better for her.\n\nRegarding your post: NTA", "NTA. If this were a one off incident I would say N-A-H. But it seems from your post that this is a regular occurrence, her not recognizing your contribution to your family and lifestyle. Yes, she\u2019s a SAHM and has the kids every day, so she needs a break. But you also have a full time job that provides her the means to not have to work and stay at home with the children. You need a break too. \nDads get a raw deal with the whole Mother\u2019s/Father\u2019s Day thing. In my small business this year I made over \u00a32k on Mother\u2019s Day cards and gifts. Father\u2019s Day? \u00a378. Your wife is not recognizing you and your hard work, and immediately deflected to cover up her lack of interest in your wellbeing.", "NTA. I wonder what your wife would say if you put it to her this way: she put her old job in front of her family. The message sent is that her husbands emotional needs are less important to her than her former work colleagues. \n\nShe may not have seen it that ways as she sounds overwhelmed, but it\u2019s framed this way she might get it better. \n\nEither way, it sounds like in spite of your best efforts, she needs a little more support and time away. Your post is full of good intentions- perhaps after the emotions have settled a bit you could initiate a conversation about how this has shown that you both have unmet needs?  Explore more how you can support each other better?  Clearly you want to.", "NAH based on this part\n\n>She told me that she\u2019s home with the kids all day just about every day and I only have to help out after work and as far as she\u2019s concerned I regularly get a break and she doesn\u2019t.\n\nbeing a SAHM is also a job, undoubtedly harder than \"regular jobs\" especially because you have one special needs child. it's also harder for her because of all different things that are expected to be done besides childcare like cleaning, cooking, picking up after the kids and the mental load of keeping track of all tasks, appointments etc.\n\ni believe that you are doing your best by helping out after work and giving her a break on her bday and Mothers Day, but it sounds like a difficult situation where there is too much workload for her to get a fair amount of breaks. do you understand where she's coming from?\n\nof course you deserve to have a nice Father's Day too so I think it would be fair for her to make it up to you on another day. but I am trying to figure out the underlying causes that need to be addressed to really solve this issue.", "Gone until 10PM for an ex boss\u2019s DAD?? Don\u2019t fool yourself man. She gettin that old boss dong.", "NTA. This wasn't a close relationship woth the person that died and I think you should have been prioritised in this situation.  \n\nHowever, I do have to wonder if you wife is feeling trapped. I raised a child with a mild disability as well, and I appreciate that you are both probably stretched thin.

Its weird to drive 2 hours and miss Father's Day to go to the funeral of someone not family or a close relative. Also that the funeral was on a Sunday in the first place.\n\nThere's more going on here than your wife attending a funeral on Father's Day. Were her and her old boss close? It's strange that she was personally invited to the funeral by her old boss. And that she said she'd be home at 5 and didn't get home until 10. She wanted to get out of the house for sure. You also said she wasn't doing as much for you lately as you were doing for her - is she perhaps feeling neglected, unhappy, etc.", "NTA.  It's unfortunate that Father's Day seems to command so little respect, especially when compared to Mother's Day.  There is just this assumption that fathers do virtually nothing in the home which I know from my experience is not always true.", "NTA. Why is she going to the funeral of her old boss' dad? She blew up weeks off plans for a random former acquaintance?", "ESH", "ESH\n\nBoth of you are kind of AHs. She dropped the ball and didn't even get cards for the kids. You are making this into a big deal and not looking for solution(at least not in this post). She was at a funeral. Father's day comes every year. You normally die once. Talk it out and say both of you made mistakes and try to plan a day for you on a day off if possible. Your less of an AH than she is.", "NAH. I get that you\u2019re disappointed and yes, to a certain extent she dropped the ball on not having card ready. You need to be clear that you feel slighted and unloved.\n\nBUT this was a funeral. A FUNERAL. A one off, emotionally heavy event where she was supporting a grieving family.\n\nAnd I think your wife might be struggling. Being a stay home mum is very difficult and isolating and you don\u2019t get time off during the day. \n\nYou have the chance to be among your adult peers and coworkers. You may even have travel time to decompress. With one of your children being autistic and the other so young I doubt she has even a moment to herself. My husband frequently tells me he couldn\u2019t do what I do. He knows full well I can\u2019t even go to the toilet without being interrupted. When the kids are asleep I will be the one tidying up, cleaning and making sure everything is ready for appointments/events/the next day. Even for seeing friends or family or going out, she is still having to be on the ball all the time for the kids. It\u2019s a different kind of stress and perhaps one she is having problems with. It can make her resentful without her knowing it and she may even feel like she\u2019s a bad mother for saying anything. \n\nPlease communicate with each other and take some time to explain how you both may be feeling and then you may be able to take steps to help and support each other.", "YTA", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re both selfish people who see family as a chore.\n\nGet over it and move on.", "YTA\n\nYou can reschedule your Father's Day celebrations/break. You can't reschedule a funeral. \nIt might just be me, but I definitely find work to be a break. Each time I've returned to work after maternity leave is like a holiday.

I adore my boss. They are an outstanding human being, and I would want to support them during a hard time. I know it is unusual, but some people do have those close relationships with their bosses. Perhaps the environment and type of work makes that dynamic more or less possible. \n\nReading the post made me curious if the wife wants to remain a SAHM though.", "Depends on the relations you have with your boss. They could be good friends, apart from professional relationship.", "From the title, I was totally expecting that this was the funeral of someone really close to OP's wife...but her \"old boss's Dad\"????? Nope, that doesn't justify forcing your husband to cancel his father's day plans. She could have sent her condolences in a nice card a flower arrangement, and surely the old boss would have understood that she couldn't just leave her family on father's day - that is a day that most people devote to family.

I would even say it would be different if the funeral was closer so she didn't have to be gone all day. And her not getting home until 5 hours after she was supposed to and it doesn't seem like she gave a reason why. Plus she didn't even get him cards. It took about 10min for me and my kids to get cards for my husband for Father's Day. She didn't even do the bare minimum.", "Yep, exactly.", "This is my thought!!

OP sounds.. stressed.\n\nFather's day could easily be delayed to a different weekend to make way for another event.", "I can't disagree with this, but I think wifey dropped the ball by not getting the kids to make OP at least a card, or something. Especially when he makes an effort for mother's day. I'd feel a bit aggrieved in his shoes too.", "I agree with this. OP, the difference is what you\u2019re considering a break. Your wife is considering any break from childcare a break. Often this is something as small as going grocery shopping alone. This is why she\u2019s saying that you get a break every day by going to work. What you\u2019re talking about is a break from all responsibility.\n\nYou need to consider these as tier 1 and tier 2.\n\nTier 1 is more important, it\u2019s the change of responsibilities. It\u2019s you coming home and taking care of everything child-related while she takes care of other responsibilities. This *needs* to be met before you can address tier 2.\n\nTier 2 is a legitimate break for both of you when you\u2019re off the clock. *This needs to happen more than once a year!* That\u2019s not even close to enough time to recharge and help with burnout and you\u2019re both feeling that. To start with, split Saturday. Each individual gets 6 hours of time so whatever the heck they want. 7-1pm and 1-7pm. This can be going out or staying in and watching Netflix with noise cancelling headphones. It doesn\u2019t matter. They are off the clock and for all intents and purposes *not to be bothered*. Because you\u2019re at work all week I recommend your wife get the first shift of 6 hours to herself so she has something to give the second half of the day.\n\nAlso, plan nights in. Give the kids macaroni and cheese for dinner and grab takeout for yourself so no one has to cook or cleanup. Watch a movie together at the end of the night. Anything that takes 0 effort right now is what you want. You can build up to doing more later. If you\u2019re up for it, try to bring little moments of thoughtfulness back. A card left on the breakfast table saying you love her and hope she has a good day. Bringing her favorite chocolate bar home. A back rub at the end of the day *with no other expectations*. (I realize these are geared toward you but generally it starts with one person and the other picks up on it).\n\nI\u2019d also recommend a therapist. You can even do phone calls if you don\u2019t have the time to go out. You both need someone to help you process this season because it\u2019s freaking hard and it\u2019s so normal that you\u2019re burnt out!", "She's a stay at home mom.  How is this an employment-related funeral?

There are very few jobs that would compare to what she\u2019s doing. Do you work an extremely taxing job? At this moment, she has a valid argument on that one. \n\nYou two need to reevaluate this entire agreement. Birthdays and M & F days aren\u2019t the days to spend AWAY from the family. Those are the days to spend WITH the family. Hire a babysitter once night every week or two and go do something TOGETHER as a date night.

And if what OP says is true about prioritizing birthdays and Mother\u2019s/Father\u2019s Day and he treats her on those days like he claims, then she is the AH here. I can\u2019t imagine how many AH votes OP would be getting if he was gone all day on Mother\u2019s Day to attend a colleague\u2019s dad\u2019s funeral.
