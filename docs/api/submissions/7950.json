She was having a negative effect on your family life, marriage, lifestyle, and mental health.\n\nAs for the fight itself, ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have stooped down to her level and said hurtful things back to her, but I do understand being seized by the anger of having her say hurtful things to you. Hearing those kinds of things from strangers is one thing, but it hits a different emotional level when it comes from someone that means so much to you.\n\nI hope you and your mother can make amends some day.", "NTA. Some people just have the type of relationship with their parents where they can only see each other once in a while and that\u2019s okay.

I don't think that we ever fully bonded as a *family*.\n\nGrandma meant well, but she was ever present, and had opinions on every aspect of our lives.\n\nIt sounds like your mother is very detrimental to your mental health when living with you, OP.  She doesn't think that you are an adult, and advises accordingly.\n\nYou made the right decision.  NTA", "NTA, wait do we have the same Mother? JK. So boundaries are so important in a situation like this. It can be hard to set up with a parent sometimes. Especially when it involves their grand kids. She was clearly crossing lines that you had. \n\nI wish you luck in mending the relationship. Writing a letter to her and not sending it may be a good way to get all of your thoughts down and can be therapeutic.", "It may take some time for the dust to settle. When it does, you and your mother are going to have to figure out how to piece your relationship together differently than how it was before, because the enmeshment was unhealthy for both of you. The first step in that was rightly asking her to move out.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that it lead to a fight and that a lot of anger came out the way it did. I\u2019m sure it was a very tense and scary time. That said, you can\u2019t be expected to have boundless patience and understanding. You were pushed past your limit and responded in kind. It happens. You can apologize for what you regret later.\n\nNTA. \n\nYou are responsible for you and your family.

She got mad, hung up on me, sat round stewing in her juices for a while waiting for me to call and say I am sorry. But she has finally learned her guilt trips have no effect on me. \n\nMe and my dad never had the best relationship, but I have no idea how he put up with her as long as he did. Not to say I do not love her, talk to her on the phone or visit. Just I keep her at arms length so not to go insane from her BS.", "NTA. She moved into your life too far. Your effort to reestablish healthy boundaries for yourself was going to hurt her feelings no matter how it played out. \n\nThe only solution here is communication with her.

It's unfortunate the way it escalated at the end, but it was inevitable. I hope you can mend the relationship with your mom soon. Nothing is more important than family. Hopefully, time will heal all and hopefully you both are doing your part to mend the relationship. I think you made a very healthy decision.", "NTA. You were completely within your rights to ask your mother to leave. This was your home and your family, it was not your mother's place to tell you what to do. If you didn't ask your mother to leave, it would have set up a precedent that your mother was the authority in your household.\n\nOne aside: there is a truth about people who give unsolicited advice: they are not giving it for your benefit, but for their own. Chances are your mother could not get out of \"mother\" mode and was unable to see you as the head of your own household, thus her constant \"advice\" to you - she was reinforcing her authority as your mother. \n\nIn the end, you needed to kick her out to return you life to normal.

Your husband didn't know how you felt til it was too late because you never talked about it, and it seems the same with your mother. You never communicated boundaries to her, so you just kept letting her walk all over you until it too late. You should call your mom and apologize for the fight and communicate how what she did made you feel in a way that doesn't attack her.", "From OP\u2019s post. \n\n\u201cThings came to a head when my mother decided to move in with us.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to assume she never did. Regardless, mom should have a little more self-awareness to realize she\u2019s walking over her daughter in her own house.", "Uh huh then mom sees her self as right and keeps right on doing it. Moms do not understand boundaries.", "Where's the part where she says her husband was excited? She didn't just move in, they needed her money to keep them afloat.", "No they were just once again expecting her mother to fund their life (as she had already done so for several years at the beginning of their marriage). She didn't \"decide to move in\" she decided to OFFER financial assistance by moving in to help out the couple who could not once again pay their own bills.", "Well, someone ACCEPTED that invitation, knowing how she was...that's not okay either.", "> Things came to a head when **my mother decided to move in**\u2026\n\n> I was hesitant, **but my husband was excited about the idea**\u2026", "If neither is okay then ESH should be the consensus."]}
