I have two children: Prakyat (11 M) and Riya (12 F), the latter of which is my step-daughter.\n\nWe were bursting crackers in the lawn of our bungalow during the evening. There's an American kid in the next block, who's 11 years old himself (Alex). He's autistic.\n\nAs we celebrated, Alex was headed somewhere with his parents. He rushed over when he noticed the crackers, asking us what we were doing. Prakyat explained it to him while Riya remained silent. He asked the kids whether he could burst some crackers himself.\n\nRiya said \"Sorry, but it's not for retards like you.\" His parents had heard what she had said and were shocked, including myself. I asked Riya to make an immediate apology, but she refused.\n\nShe had only said the truth and that Alex would hurt himself as he's autistic. I was extremely embarrassed, and even my wife asked her to apologize once, but she refused.\n\nI apologized to the parents who did not say anything as they walked away with Alex. I was livid, and asked Riya to get back to her room (that she was grounded for a week), cancelled the party for her, and said she wasn't bursting crackers. She became hysterical, telling me that was too much. But I did not budge and in the end she was forced to remain in her room and is not allowed outside. I took Prakyat to Alex's house later with some Diwali sweets and apologized again, and this time they were a little more pleased about the apology.\n\nMy wife says I went too far and that although she should not have said that, my punishment for a week and no celebration for her ruined it for her, etc.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699710854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17suuo2/aita_for_cancelling_my_stepdaughters_diwali/", "score": 7317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think that is a totally appropriate punishment.", "NTA\n\nand ironically on point for the meaning of Diwali, no? \n\nso maybe Riya will have a difficult week and it will enable her to grow a small bit of empathy for what Alex goes through every day.", "Teacher here. Thank you for teaching Riya the power of words, especially cruel ones like that. She will be a better person for it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis is how you parent and you've done the best possible job in this situation, including going to their house to apologize again, and with some treats for Alex. \n\nThe \"R\" word is considered a major slur these days, so I'm glad you stamped it out. Hopefully she can realize just how bad of a word it really is, how hurtful it was and she learned a lesson.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s learning a lesson about her words and actions. \n\nShe can pout and stomp her feet all she wants, she\u2019s gotta learn what she did was wrong.", "NTA! As a child when I would get grounded and no phone privileges for say 2 weeks, I remember throwing myself on the floor like it was the end of the world! I thought I would die without access to the telephone! But I learned my lesson on that, what I say and do has consequences. I myself can control what I say and do but I myself cannot control the consequences so act accordingly!", "NTA\n\nAs the parent of an autistic kid, thank you for not allowing this disgusting behavior.", "Considering \"Riya\" has found this and is doubling down on insulting the neighbor AND acting like an entitled brat, I would say your punishment did not go far enough as she obviously learned nothing. You're NTA, and her mom thinking you went to far goes a long way toward explaining why her daughter behaves this way.", "NTA. Attitudes like your SD\u2019s need to be stopped as soon as possible. And, honestly, just one grounding will not do it - this will just teach her to hide her prejudices. You need to find a therapist who specializes in these things to work with her. \n\nHowever, in response to your wife (about how the grounding ruined the celebration for her) - that was the point of the grounding. The punishment wouldn\u2019t have an impact if it didn\u2019t. If this is how your wife reacts when your SD acts badly, I can see how she ended up like this.", "NTA\n\nYour punishment was not excessive at all.\n\nThis is a lesson your stepdaughter needs to learn NOW, and she needs to be held accountable in the future if this does not nip this behavior in the bud.\n\nYour wife is enabling her and nothing but trouble is going to come from that.", "NTA\n\nYou are a good man with impeccable morals. Good for you.", "NTA here is a prize from me for good parenting", "NTA but perhaps a better lesson would be to include some education on differences in others. Make her read a book where the main character is different than her or something like the Diary of Anne Frank that shows how that way of thinking, when taken tot he extreme, can do massive harm.", "NTA. She had a chance to apologize and walk back her use of a slur to insult a child to his face. Instead she doubled down. You're doing the right thing for enforcing consequences.", "Indian descent here. You're doing a really good job of raising her. By showing her that her actions have consequences, you are correcting errors that your wife has made with her. I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but your stepdaughter turned out that way because your wife did not set rules and encouraged that behavior. I truly believe that if you lay ground rules and continue to show her the better route, she will change and get better. Thanks for being a good father and best wishes.", "NTA. 12 is beyond old enough to know that this language is unacceptable. Hopefully the consequences of her actions will lead to a change of attitude.", "NTA.  Doesn\u2019t matter what disability he has, calling anyone a r***** is a flat out slur.  Make sure she understands that first, then talk about how she could have included him, even if she was worried.", "NTA she should know better.", "Your step daughter is incredibly cruel.  I would sit down and have a long talk with her about how no one likes mean girls.  NTA", "NTA! What you did was absolutely right. As a suggestion why don't you sit with your daughter and explain to her what the spirit of this festival is about and why it was wrong of her to do what she did.", "The R word is a slur. Plain and simple. How we she had reacted if she\u2019d been called a racial slur? \n\nI\u2019m not big on punishing kids, I prefer to teach them and give logical consequences. I\u2019d likely make her take a class on neurodivergence and inclusion rather than taking away arbitrary things. But\u2026I have to admit in this instance I\u2019d likely schedule those things when her party was. If you can\u2019t act like a civil human being you don\u2019t get to be around people. \n\nNTA.", "It\u2019s correct behaviour. As an Indian I am happy that you made sure that your kid learns the true meaning of Diwali which is Ram over Ravan. And her behaviour reeks of bad behaviour something Lord Ram would never stand for. Diwali isn\u2019t about bursting crackers and eating sweets it\u2019s about learning good always triumphs over evil. And the kid needs to learn that lesson.", "NTA. \n\nCelebrations aren\u2019t for bullies like her \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. I'm not someone who generally punishes kids or thinks punishment is appropriate,  but in this case, I think it is fitting. \n\nI might have taken a different approach, but you are absolutely NTA.", "NTA. You did right dad! I think it might also be appropriate for her to have to write a letter of apology. She was unnecessarily cruel and that\u2019s a giant red flag that you wife is more upset about the punishment than she is about her daughters actions", "NTA. She was ablist and cruel, and when told to apologise, she doubled down. If she is to learn that this behaviour is unacceptable, she needs to face consequences. \nI would ask your wife if she would have challenged the punishment if your daughter had been racist and refused to accept that racism is unacceptable behaviour. If your wife thinks that racism is worse than ablism (disability discrimination / abuse), then she needs some education on this subject too. NTA and thank you for teaching your child that it is not acceptable to discriminate against or abuse people for their disability.", "NTA.  She doubled down when you both told her to apologize.  She doesn\u2019t get to throw a fit.", "NTA  Not only did she purposefully say hurtful things to another person but disrespected your wife and yourself by refusing to apologize when you told her to. Sit her down and ask her if she knew what she did was wrong then make her tell you. If she can't she needs to go back to her room and think about it. If she can ask her how she is going to make it right. If she either can't answer or doesn't want to find a way then party stays off. If she can tell you how she can make it right tell her she has to do it. After all this time a simple apology won't suffice. If she can do all you ask then she can have her party, if not then no party. Leave having the party or not up to her own actions going forward.", "NTA at all your stepdaughter needs to learn kindness and not to use derogatory language", "The refusing to be corrected and apologize is extremely concerning. NTA. You and your wife need to get on the same page about bullying fast.", "NTA. \n\nAs someone who has autistic family members and is also neurodivergent, thank you. \n\nYour daughter used a slur. You are definitely not the AH here. Your wife kinda is for thinking that your daughter shouldn't get any serious consequences for this. Your daughter is also the AH because 12 year olds are old enough to know better.", "NTA, that's the most disgusting thing to say to a kid, punishment is appropriate.", "NTA. That word is only used as a pejorative now and she well knows it. I would\u2019ve also made her write a research paper on autism and/or the harmful affects of ableist/racist/homophobic language, because our kids are the best chance we have to stop this kind of talk from perpetuating.", "tell your wife that if she had an issue with how you handled it, then she should have stepped in and been a parent to her child. she remained silent. she doesn't get to complain now that you stepped up and dealt with it. NTA", "NTA. MAYBE if she showed any remorse and apologized, you could go easier on her. But she still thinks she was right! That kind of behavior needs to be stopped immediately when it happens or it will escalate.", "NTA. \n\nThe concerning part to me is that when she was admonished she doubled down. A child might stay stubbornly silent because she\u2019s embarrassed to be scolded, but she actually kept arguing. It makes me think she doesn\u2019t acknowledge your authority as you\u2019re a step parent which is normal. Since her mother isn\u2019t on the same page as you, it\u2019s unlikely your daughter will learn any lesson from this punishment unfortunately.\n\nI agree with you, but it doesn\u2019t matter if internet strangers agree. You and your wife need to get on the same page with this.  In future, you and your wife should discuss punishments together and agree before they\u2019re meted out.", "NTA. And Riya may be on the spectrum herself. Insistence on \"the truth\" & refusing to apologize is something I've seen in children with autism. Autistic or not, this kid has a long hard road ahead if she continues her obnoxiousness.", "NTA but you need to fix that kids attitude asap. She said what she said to some nice neighbors. If she does that in line at an amusement park, store, or restaurant, that could cause all sorts of trouble.", "NTA.  Your daughter was rude, insensitive, and absolutely an AH.  She's old enough to know better and to think before she speaks.  \n\n\nShe absolutely deserved the punishment.", "NTA.  it's never to early to learn about FAFO.", "NTA. That\u2019s disgusting behaviour and a 12 year old should know better. Appropriate punishment, that\u2019s for sure.", "NTA - Your wife would be enabling her bad behavior by allowing a lax punishment.  You need to think about that.", "NTA \nYour punishment fights the crime. Your wife needs to be taught how to treat others as well.", "She deserved exactly what she got.   Hopefully she learned a lesson about inclusion and understanding and not just about her thinking parents are too \"harsh and unfair\".", "NTA. Totally appropriate. Don't tolerate bratty kids.", "NTA.  Alex didn\u2019t do anything but ask if he could participate.  He didn\u2019t rudely violate anything.  You SD was rude AF and unapologetic about her behavior.  Punishments have to hurt so a kid will remember.  She will remember this and think twice before she acts like a brat", "I'm not from your diaspora, so I don't know the significance of forbidding your daughter from Diwali celebrations this year. I do know it's every year though.\n\nNTA. \n\nYour daughter not only was incredibly rude, but when you and your wife asked her to apologize, she refused. You had to put your foot down and teach her a lesson. Good on you. She needs to learn that's not okay.", "Nta. \n\nYou did good. Such behaviour must Be nipped at roots.", "Nta.  It might have been harsh if she apologized, since she refused it seems appropriate to me.  \nShe should know not to use that word, and Alex using the crackers was not her call.", "NTA - but your wife is lowkey giving off red flags that she would encourage your daughter's bigotry.", "NTA. That's a horrible word to use in general, but especially in that context. That word has centuries of oppression behind it, it's on par with several other slurs that should never be used.\n\nBut you need to talk to her. She's 12, where the hell did she learn that word, and why does she think it's okay to use? Was it at school or from friends? Does she have access to the internet or Tik Tok or something? She learned that word somewhere and she's going to learn more if you don't put a stop to it and educate her.", "Mate, you did good. Actions have consequences. NTA.", "\u201cShe had only said the truth that Alex would hurt himself as he\u2019s autistic.\u201d\n\nI find this notion troubling and encourage you to become more educated on what autism and neuro-divergence actually is. There was another parent that posted maybe a week ago about not allowing his kids on an educational trip because the bus driver had visible Down\u2019s Syndrome. People with mental differences are a lot smarter and more capable than you think, sometimes even to a talented degree because of those very stereotypes demanding a higher standard from them just to be given equal rights or acknowledgement.\n\nEdit: Hey guys ty for pointing out that OP possibly didnt mean this as his own thoughts but his daughter\u2019s.", "The fact that she even called him that vile name to begin with is a level of disrespect my children would have also been grounded for. The fact that she refused to apologize is very telling in what she believes right now at 12. Nip that crap in the bud right now otherwise you will be raising an entitled , bullying , disrespectful, and mean human. NTA , she deserves to lose something she looked forward to due to the blatant disrespect", "Please ask her where she learned the \u201cR\u201d word from and who else is using it the way she did\u2026 get to the root of it\u2026 this is just as important as the punishment bc if it\u2019s an adult she might have trouble understanding why she\u2019s in trouble if she\u2019s copying an adult if it\u2019s other kids it allows you to make changes in her friend group", "You sound a brilliant stepdad \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe punishment was appropriate. I agree she should learn some of the history of the word. Thank you for being a good parent OP!", "N T A. Your reaction and apology was appropriate.", "Kids need to learn man they just can't be rude and you did the right thing i would've done the same. NTA", "As an autistic individual myself. NTA. I\u2019m so shocked she said something so horrific.", "100% NTA. The girl needs to learn how wicked her behavior was.", "NTA. Your step daughter needs to learn empathy or unfortunately she will end up like one of the kids who bully other kids. First step is to hold her accountable which you have already achieved! I would suggest having a talk with her and maybe asking her why she thought saying any of that was okay to begin with?", "NTA. This will be a wake-up reminder for her to not to be cruel to people in the future.", "As a mother of an Autistic child thank you for actually caring, stepping in to correct her, punishing her to send the point home and apologizing to the family again. I hope this is enough to make her think twice about saying that I'm the future. I think you parented it well honestly.", "Your wife is wrong and you are right. What she said is awful, and though she is a child, she's old enough to know that. \n\nIt will cause her grave difficulties later in life if she goes around insulting people with such gross language, so apart from punishing her, I suggest you seek to understand why an otherwise nice child would say something so rude to someone's face.", "NTA.\n\nExtremely appropriate, and I hope Riya takes time to think about her words. 12 is old enough to know right from wrong when it comes to words being hurtful.\n\nDiwali is all about knowledge over ignorance, good over evil so if she can't even understand those spiritual beliefs then defo she doesn't get to partake.\n\nThe only thing I'd change is the taking over of sweets, as the best Indian food is all about the savoury snacks.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. I think it's a reasonable response to what happened.", "NTA punishment seems appropriate but if she had been remorseful and apologized it would be different.", "NTA", "NTA. Good for you for teaching her that words can be awful,", "NTA. Riya was cruel in her statement and is old enough to know this. It would be good to sit down and make the parallel in her comment to it being bias and discriminatory. Unfortunately, in the US she herself may become a victim of what she did to the boy (or she already has faced this). It is time for lessons on empathy and that \"being honest\" is not a word you hide behind to justify being mean. \n\nStanding your ground was good and hopefully your wife can understand this was not a small thing her daughter did.", "NTA. Appropriate punishment. She\u2019s not 5. She knew better.", "NTA - Maybe she will learn to be kind instead of an AH.", "You are right.", "ruining the celebration for her is the IDEA . its a punishment not a errr can't think of a word there... non-punishment", "NTA, she won't say it a second time now will she!", "NTA at all.  \n\nAppropriate or even lenient.", "NTA. She was out of line and you did the responsible thing.", "NTA, she refused to apologize twice. Maybe when everyone has calmed down, ask her where she heard that from.", "NTA I would of been mortified if my kid said that to somone disabled. You did the right thing, she has to learn", "NTA. Youre doing great modeling respect for others. Teach her now before she says something to the wrong person and they choose violence. Whatever happened too, \"if you cant say nothing nice, say nothing at all!\" Id have a bigger conversation about how words can hurt and teach a little more empathy...", "NTA.  Your daughter used a slur to denigrate a disabled child who had done nothing to her but asked to join the fun.  She refused to apologize and still doesn't seem to think she did anything wrong.  I would say you didn't do enough.  Your wife has a strange idea of what is right and wrong.  I would be concerned about the parenting she does in the long run.", "NTA.\nWhy should she get to celebrate when she was needlessly cruel for no reason? Your punishment was fitting. She ruined someone's day, so in turn ruined her own. Maybe next time she wants to be cruel, she'll remember this lesson and think twice.", "NTA.  Consequences need to have teeth to them or they're worthless.  Kids need to learn not to blurt out every rude thought that goes through their heads, preferably before they become adults that do blurt out every rude thought that goes through their heads.", "NTA.  I'd expect a typical 12 year old to be a more socially aware than that. I think if you set a tone early and often that be anything less than polite, even for people we might not know or like, is unaccepttable.  Is English you and/or your wife's second language?  Maybe she doesn't get how inappropriate or offensive this is?  NOT OK!  Would not be tolerated in a school setting.\n\nShe can thank you later when she has more mature social skills.", "Nta. She needed to learn compassion and manners", "NTA as someone with autism, thank you so much for defending Alex, he would have noticed that and hopefully it would have taken away some of the pain caused by Riya. I think your punishment is fair", "NTA. Guess she found out what happens when you act like a jerk. Good for you for putting strong punishments in place.", "NTA. Your daughter was unnecessarily cruel to your neighbor and his parents. How else is she to come to understand that *words can hurt*? She may never have been insulted in such a way \\*yet\\*, but experiences like that can hurt someone for a lifetime.", "NTA - some people have to learn the hard way", "NTA.  Grounding for a couple days MAYBE if she had apologized. What she said is unacceptable but the refusal to say sorry is next level.  This girl needs to learn how hurtful that is and a real punishment is warranted.  \n\nThat said, I do hope you try to really talk to her and explain how cruel she was.  Figuring out why she feels that saying such a thing was okay is important.", "No. You're not wrong. What she did is sooo wrong, not only for a child, but for anyone, of any age to say. And she did not even have the decency to apologize, but rather double down..... she chose the hill to die on, so she now has to deal with the consequences of her actions. If you allowed her to celebrate Diwali, the message would have been that it's ok to speak like that to people and still enjoy the benefits of the celebration. You did the right thing. \nAlso, Shubh Diwali", "NTA. totally appropriate punishment. \nDon\u2019t budge. She needs to learn that while she can say whatever she wants, your words can have consequences.", "NTA. Completely appropriate punishment for something so horrible.", "NTA. Your punishment was appropriate. Twelve is old enough to know better.", "NTA, parenting done right! Negative actions have negative consequences.  Well done!", "NTA you taught her a valuable lesson. Words can hurt more than physical bullying ever does.  They stick with you longer.   What Riya did to Alex was unacceptable especially given your reaction.

You definitely want to nip that kind of behavior in the bud.", "NTA", "NTA.", "I think some volunteer work as a family might be good in the near future, she is at a good age to learn about other people\u2019s struggles.

Its not. Your daughter will get over it, and the sting that boy ajd his parents feel (and I can vouch) is going to last a lot longer than her punishment. And if this is how wifey deals with punishment for severe shitty behavior, its no wonder her child is turning into a rotten person. And yes, people that say this kinda shit to people with disabilities are rotten. Idc how old you are. She learned that somewhere.", "NTA. Parents need to start giving firm consequences to these actions. It is UNACCEPTABLE for ANYONE to speak to another person that way. The fact that she so freely used that word means she's hearing it somewhere. It's time to show her what the consequences of being a bully are before she causes her peers trauma. She'd be hand writing an apology at the end of her grounding as well or she would remain grounded if it were me. I don't care how long she decides to hold firm on her opinion, she would be required to apologize to gain back any luxuries.", "NTA   NTA 1 million times is not too much.  This is not about \"step\" daughter ... it is about Kindness, Thinking before you speak, and Words Matter.  It is about being a string parent making a line in the sand not to be crossed.  You were not mean.  You were firm in a Moment that definitely called for great Firmness.  Your daughter said \"that was too much\"?  To me that means she expected punishment, but decided she has a say in the amount.  Nope.  My rules says the parent.  Dad needs to support you.", "Totally acceptable punishment. You are a great parent. She will learn she can't say things like that.", "I did something mean when I was about 9-10 years old.

Thank you for you stand.", "If my child did that but realized they did something wrong and apologized,  i would have done it for 2 days.

Not at all.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nTo be blunt, your wife treating things like this so lightly has probably contributed to your step daughter's behavior.", "Definitely NTA.

If not, explain it to her.", "She gets that horrendous behavior from your horrible wife. NTA", "NTA. However, I don\u2019t feel I understand the cultural significance to know if that was enough or not.", "NTA- sometimes you have to love your kids enough to let them be wrong, and suffer the consequences. Too many parents gloss over mistakes, go \"mama bear\" and make sure their child is always in the right, no matter who they hurt. Kids who grow up like that grow into horrible, entitled adults. \n\nIt's hard, it doesn't feel good for you or for them, but having consequences when they mess up and make poor choices is pivotal to ensure that they learn from the experience. You have to love them enough to let them be wrong. \n\nCongratulations on doing that. Your wife could take a few pointers. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Riya is TAH.", "NTA. BTW, thank you for parenting your child now so the courts won't have to later.", "NTA- totally acceptable consequences. As a mom with a daughter on the spectrum, I would have been horrified, especially because she felt it was OK to say in front of her parents. \n\nHowever, consequences without teaching them why what they did was wrong just teaches them to hide that behavior, not correct it. Clearly she saw nothing wrong with what she said and even how she said it which means she hasn't learned appropriate social behavior when it comes to people with special needs.", "NTA. Thanks for holding her accountable. It would be worth investigating *why* she thinks that\u2019s an \u2018acceptable\u2019 thing to say. Only people I\u2019ve see  who still use that outdated and horrible \u2018terminology\u2019 with their full chest are kids in her age-group and doubled-down hopeless adults. \n\nI\u2019d love to see her face next time she asks for something as simple and benign as to pass the salt and is replied to with \u201csorry, but it\u2019s not for ignorant heartless brats like you.\u201d \n\n(Not saying do this to her, obviously)", "NTA. She was out of line. Waaaaay out of line.", "NTA, she\u2019s not exempt from punishment because it\u2019s a holiday. If anything, missing a big once-a-year event is good for her.

I have two children: Prakyat (11 M) and Riya (12 F), the latter of which is my step-daughter.\n\nWe were bursting crackers in the lawn of her bungalow during the evening. There's an American kid in the next block, who's 11 years old himself (Alex). He's autistic.\n\nAs we celebrated, Alex was headed somewhere with his parents. He rushed over when he noticed the crackers, asking us what we were doing. Prakyat explained it to him while Riya remained silent. He asked the kids whether he could burst some crackers himself.\n\nRiya said \"Sorry, but it's not for retards like you.\" His parents had heard what she had said and were shocked, including myself. I asked Riya to make an immediate apology, but she refused.\n\nShe had only said the truth and that Alex would hurt himself as he's autistic. I was extremely embarrassed, and even my wife asked her to apologize once, but she refused.\n\nI apologized to the parents who did not say anything as they walked away with Alex. I was livid, and asked Riya to get back to her room (that she was grounded for a week), cancelled the party for her, and said she wasn't bursting crackers. She became hysterical, telling me that was too much. But I did not budge and in the end she was forced to remain in her room and is not allowed outside. I took Prakyat to Alex's house later with some Diwali sweets and apologized again, and this time they were a little more pleased about the apology.\n\nMy wife says I went too far and that although she should not have said that, my punishment for a week and no celebration for her ruined it for her, etc.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'd just like to explain where I'm coming from here. From my understanding, the vast majority of disabled people prefer to say they are disabled (they also prefer identity first language over person first). These individuals have often spoken about their dislike for phrases like different abilities, special needs, differently abled, etc. and often urge other people to just say disabled instead. When talking about/to an individual person, I always respect how they identify and the language they use to describe themselves. When I'm not referring to a specific individual, but speaking about multiple people in a broad and general way, I will default to saying \"disabled people\".

The extra delay is instead them learning that they need to fake empathy to be given the time of day. Unless they experience serious hardship later in life that entirely changes their personality, I think you almost entirely predict whether someone is worth knowing by how young they were when they first became inconsolable due to hurting someone else. God knows the arseholes I knew as kids never changed, and the kids my friends have raised don't seem to either.\n\nI'd almost go as far as saying that we've hopefully gotten past most of our constant warring, and really we need very few unempathetic people in our society.

Again, I'm sorry. Second- thank you for the context about your friend. If your friend prefers to say \"different abilities\" that is absolutely okay. Not everybody likes to say they are disabled/have disabilities and I always try to respect each individual when it comes to how they identify and the language they use to describe themselves. When I'm not talking about a specific individual, however, but speaking in a broad, general sense, I say \"disabled people\". This is because, from my understanding, the vast majority of disabled people prefer to say they are disabled, over phrases like special needs, differently abled, different abilities, etc. They also prefer identiry first language over person first, too. But again, I always try to respect each individual person, not only when talking to them, but about them. I hope this all makes sense.", "It doesn't have to be difficult, is the thing. The only reason it keeps \"changing\" is because of non-disabled who don't listen to/speak over disabled people. Like I said, the vast majority of disabled people really don't care for these phrases and euphemisms and are just fine with saying disability/disabled. Obviously, this doesn't apply to everyone and obviously you should respect how each individual identitifies and the language they prefer to use to describe themselves. Also, if I come off as rude in this comment and my original one, I'm really sorry. I'm not meaning to be.", "I thought this correction was pretty gracious.

One take I like is that Raktabija is a metaphor for how easily psychosocial ails proliferate themselves, in this case meaning ignorance/bigotry. The demon of prejudice is most visible in big 'monsters' like hate crimes, but it's spread the most (and hardest to kill) when it's microaggressions or 'just' words - much like Ratkabija clones himself every when even single drop of his blood touched the earth. There's a reason why regular goddess of war Durga wasn't enough to kill him, and she had to respawn into super-angry/destructive Kali to get rid of him.\n\nSounds like you went Kali on Riya's ass.
