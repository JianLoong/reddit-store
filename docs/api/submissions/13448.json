You too were trying to \u201cexplain artistic color theory.\u201d She started the whole conversation, She said certain dress colors didn't go well with certain skin tones. You said certain dress colors didn't go with certain skin tones and you helped her understand what skin tone she actually had so she could make a good match. NTA\n\nI think you restrained yourself well because you didn't ask \"B, who f'ing asked you shit?\"", "NTA. Also, props for sticking up for your sister. Yeah, calling the girl a bitch may not have been the best choice of word, but she\u2019s the one who brought up skin tone. If you\u2019re still in doubt, ask your sister how she feels! Most people would do anything to have someone go to bat for them, and you did that for your sister\u2026you did the right thing.", "NTA. \n\nFor the record, I'm white, and I will tell you with absolute certainty that a hell of a lot more colors look good on dark skin. You tell your sister she has the pick of the litter.", "NTA. She was being racist and she very likely knew it.", "Imo, you didn't say she had a bad skin tone, you just stated the color of it. Not all \"white\" skin tones look good in all colors. That's a fact. She just didn't want to get called out on her behavior. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI hate when people throw out being \"racist and body shaming\" as a way to deflect from their shitty behavior.\n\nYou didn't say anything against her race and/or you didn't shame her body.", "NTA- yeah- so- everyone does have a range of colors that best compliments their skin tone. I\u2019m always a bit jelly of the gorgeous jewel tones brown and black women can pull off that completely wash me out. But I also know when to STFU because unless your sister asked me- I\u2019m not saying Jack shit to a woman of color about which colors work for them other than- your skin is gorgeous, let\u2019s try shit on! \n\nAlso- if your sister likes lavender- brava- just a matter of figuring out which shade of lavender works best. -Which is a universal thing. And that stupid white girl doesn\u2019t understand undertones in both skin and fabric dye.", "NTA. Orangey pink is a pretty good description of my actual skin color.", "NTA.    She consistently commented on her skin and got so mad when you commented on her skin, that is called hypocrisy.", "NTA\n\nAnyone trying to tell someone how to dress without being asked for their opinion is opening themselves up to the same treatment. And what she was saying was both racist and wrong. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you and your sister had to go through that.", "NTA.\n\nYknow when I went prom dress shopping, the ladies kept bringing me lavender and other light color dresses that popped against my skin. I'm mixed and those were in my darker days. \n\nThe overall recommendation was to go lighter because it complimented my skin well. Hope your sister got a dress she loves.", "NTA. She got what she deserved", "NTA.\n\nCould you have handled it better? Maybe. But ignorance like that does deserve a wakeup call. Good for you for speaking up.", "NTA. You weren't wrong either. We aren't white. I vary from a faded pink to sort of raw umber from constant sun exposure. Honestly, my tan lines make look like Neapolitan ice cream.", "NTA\n\nShe could have minded her own business. Instead she decided to give her unsolicited input. Ironic that she thinks you are racist for saying her skin tones won't work either. To me that seems as if the thought of her being closer to a POC is a negative thing. Kind of shows her true colors, pun intended.", "Tbh she needed to be cussed out. That is literally a micro aggression", "NICE!!! you definitely weren't wrong", "NTA she deserved", "Orangey-pink. Lmao", "NTA she was being racist, not you. I\u2019d be calling and speaking to her manager.", "\"She got really mad at me and started crying about how I was being racist and body shaming her when all she was trying to do was \u201cexplain artistic color theory.\n\nI always explain artistic color theory by finding a teenager of a different race in a dress shop and showing them what I can wear that they cannot. Isn't that the artistic method?\n\nThis girl was a racist asshole to your sister and I know at 17 her brain isn't fully developed and all that jazz but 0% chance she didn't know exactly what she was doing, and she 100% deserved what you said to her and more. You didn't start bringing up skin color, she did. I'm livid on your sister (and your) behalf, everything this girl said was just gross and designed to cut your sister down. Also as a white person, I am flabbergasted that this girl thinks so many colors work for her skin and not for others. I spend half my shopping time admiring outfits that would make me look sickly or accentuate weird skin tones, apparently this girl thinks she's just got magic skin and will look lovely in anything and everything. You did her a service by pointing out that she's dead wrong.", "NTA it might sound petty to jump down her throat but she was dropping micro and macro expressions. I'd say something else but girl could read the room and knew what she was doing", "NTA\n\nShe was body shaming your sister for her skin colour and being racist af. It's no one's place to tell people what they should or shouldn't wear. Your sister justed wanted a prom dress that she liked, this asshole had to make it about her.", "NTA she was giving her unwanted opinion so you gave yours", "NTA. You got that Alyssa Edwards energy.", "NTA\n\nI am white, my sister is tan, with a capital T. She is the kind of tan that changes four different shades through out the year. \n\nWe shared shades of lipsticks, accessories and clothes. What looked good on me, looked good on her. There were some colours that looked good one me, some that looked good on her. But they were subtle shades (think butter vs sunshine Yellow). \n\nWhat a load of crock this girl was on about. And lavender?!? A colour that looks good on anyone. And I do mean anyone, there are so many shades too. Warm, cool, more blue, more pink.
