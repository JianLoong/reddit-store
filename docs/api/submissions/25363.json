I recently updated my will and decided not to include my stepchild as a beneficiary. Now, I'm questioning whether I might be the asshole in this scenario. Let me provide some context.\n\nI married my current spouse a few years ago, and she had a child from a previous relationship. I also have my own biological children from a previous marriage. Since my spouse and I got married, I have treated my stepchild as my own and have been financially supportive of them. However, I have always made it clear that my biological children will be the primary beneficiaries of my estate.\n\nNow, the reason for my decision is that I want to ensure that my biological children are taken care of and receive their fair share. I have built my wealth thanks to them, because my biological children have been a part of my life for longer and have a closer bond with me. I feel that it is fair to prioritize them in my will.\n\nHowever, my spouse and some family members are questioning my decision. They believe that I should include my stepchild in my will to ensure equal treatment and avoid any potential conflicts or resentments in the future. They argue that excluding my stepchild could create division within the family and make my stepchild feel excluded and hurt. They argue that as their stepparent, I have a responsibility to treat them equally and provide for them just as I would for my biological children.\n\nI understand their perspective and the potential negative impact my decision could have on my stepchild. However, I believe that it's my right and responsibility as the parent to make decisions about my estate that prioritize the well-being and future of my biological children. Additionally, I have discussed my decision with my spouse and explained my reasons behind it. They initially understood and respected my choice, but as the topic has been brought up with other family members, they started to question and doubt my decision as well. This has caused some tension and disagreements within our family.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for excluding my stepchild from my will?", "created_utc": 1692827073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zhqre/aita_for_excluding_my_stepchild_from_my_will/", "score": 405, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has two adult children from his previous marriage, Sarah (28F) and Alex (25M), whom I've had a distant relationship with due to various reasons. We don't share many interests, and they've shown little interest in building a relationship with me.\n\nRecently, I updated my will to reflect my wishes for my estate. I've always been close to my own children from a previous marriage, and I want to ensure they're well taken care of. This has led me to allocate a significant portion of my assets to my biological children.\n\nWhen my husband found out about my decision, he was hurt and upset. He believes that I should split my assets evenly between all the children, including my stepchildren, regardless of the relationships we have. He thinks it's unfair that his children are being excluded from my will when they're part of our family.\n\nI understand my husband's feelings, and I don't want to cause any strife in our marriage. However, I also believe that it's my right to allocate my assets as I see fit. I've put in effort to build a relationship with my stepchildren, but it hasn't been reciprocated. My main responsibility lies with my own children, and I want to ensure they're provided for.\n\nI'm torn between honoring my husband's wishes and doing what I believe is right for my own children. I don't want to come across as spiteful or uncaring, but I also want to make sure my kids are taken care of.

They provided college tuition assistance to their grandchildren and that was it. The estate went to their sons. That was their choice, and they were not a holes over that.\n\nMy two sisters saw them as their grandparents even if they were step. They met my grandparents at 5 and 6, respectively. They called them grandma and grandpa. My dad walked my sisters down the aisle, he is Papa to their children. He does not see them any differently, he's their family. My grandparents were their family, too.\n\nHad they included my brother and I and excluded my sisters, I'd of been really upset with them. They wouldn't have been entitled to anything, but it'd be a slap in the face. Not needed. Second class grandchildren aren't a thing.\n\nIn the last few years my brother and I *really* started leaning on our parents to finally write a trust and put the house in. If something happened, by state law the estate would be split 50/50 to each parent, my brother and I would split my dad's half and the four of us would split mom's half.\n\nMy brother and I bugged our parents to set up a trust, because is that really how you want that to go? And if something happened to mom and then dad in quick order, our sisters would legally get nothing. We'd have to fuck everyone on taxes to share.\n\nIt's not about entitlement, it's that losing parents would be awful enough without being told, 'you aren't really their child' when they are really your parent.\n\nI have actually been arguing for a smaller inheritance because my sisters are my sisters. There are no halfs. My dad is their dad. Fuck any law that says differently. The trust finally being established is an equal four-way split.\n\nIt's not entitlement to any of my dad's stuff. It's saying we're all equally loved. Equally family.\n\nIt's a bit of an a-hole move to specifically exclude stepchildren whom you've raised since a young age. If he's been this kid's stepdad for five years, he's known the stepson even longer. And, he's saying the kid is less. The wife included his kids. He excluded his. Stepmom loved the stepkids more than stepdad loved his. There's a dollar amount on it.\n\nIt's not entitlement. It's losing family and having them quantify their relationship to you.\n\nIf you're going to leave unequal amounts, you best explain the why.

Having some probate tell my sisters he wasn't actually their dad would make it so much worse.\n\nUnless there's a real reason, a lot of long-time stepkids will feel the obvious snub.  He's been in this kid's life a while. He plans on telling him he doesn't actually see him as a son.\n\nBlended families can be hard. Telling your stepkids they're seen as removed from your family makes it harder.", "I a 1k% support this thought process. But out of curiosity, did OP ever mention genders for the kids?

Enough to make it worthwhile to set up a trust.\n\nIf something awful had happened, the estate would've been split half mom, half dad. My brother and I would've each gotten half of our dad's portion. Us and our two sisters would've each gotten a quarter of mom's part. If something happened and mom and then dad passed in quick sucession, everything would've been dad's, and my brother and I would get everything.\n\nMy brother and I were bugging our parents like... come on. That ain't right. Will. Trust is better. Come on. Write me a lower share. I don't want it. Equal split, y'all.\n\nBugged 'em into finally giving me less. Score! Trust established. I only get a quarter, now.\n\nLosing both our parents would be hard. You know what'd be even harder? The state's law telling our sisters that he wasn't their dad, too. Because he is. Guess who walked both down the aisle? Yup. Guess who is Papa to my niblings? Yup. Guess who does all the dad stuff? If you guessed my dad, you're right. He's been their dad for decades, now.
