And literally all the bad things I said to her are \"I did not expect to see you today\". There was this calm fight going on between us, that she tried to fight by emotionally abusing me. She was actively unfriedly to me. I was never actively unfriendly to her prior to the dinner.\n\nI agree that average people deserve to be respected, even if they are unintelligent and uninteresting. But being unintelligent + uninteresting + actively very rude to me doesn't leave much room for respect.", "I am not trying to smell like a rose here.\n\nI am trying to be as precise as I can.\n\nShe is unintelligent. Yes, that's not a nice thing to say. But she is. She knows that she is. He knows that she is. And that's okay. My disrespect was not initiated by her being unintelligent or uninteresting. My disrespect was started by her being abusive towards me.\n\nHer being abusive to me led me to call her stupid ont he internet, instead of just \"unintelligent\".\n\nIn a nutshell.\n\nI am the kind of guy who will answer questions directly and honestly, even if others would try to find words that make them seem like less of an AH than they actually are. I am not trying to be deceiving here. I want answers.\n\nIf you think I am an AH, there's a fair chance that I in fact am.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your time. If you find this interesting, please feel free to ask more questions. I want to get to the core of it.", "That is true.", "Yeah that stuck out to me too. I don't respect everyone on this earth, but I do at least wait for them to mess up before I start acting like this.", "Yes I do realise that. And yes, this hit me like a bullet. I can't understand how people can lead a relationship based on the other half being submissive due to stupidity. Again, this are his exact words not mine.", "No that was not enough and I initially shrugged it off. But if things like this repeat, you no longer shrug them off. As I said, this was an example. I can't type out an entire decade of occurances. I mean.. I could.. but I doubt you'd be interested.", "Yeah that\u2019s true. I think he said he\u2019s German though, The ones I have met are great but cannot fake sincerity lol love em to death but very different than how Canadians sugarcoat everything \ud83d\ude02 I suppose I did let a stranger use my bathroom this past Halloween so I don\u2019t have a leg to stand on. I wanna know what was for dinner though! I\u2019ll have to go hunting in the comments lol", "I don't think you are stupid, if that helps.\n\nBut let me give you another example:  \n\n\nMy mother had a severe bicycle accident that almost brought her to her grave. The day that followed the friend came over for a random visit (alone) and I told him what happened. I am not a very openly emotional person so I had no problem telling him the facts about the accident and how my mother is feeling. It included some private information about my mother and myself that you do not share with random people who you don't trust. At this point it was an open secret that his girlfriend and I do not get along very well but we did not actively try to avoid each other, we would greet each other and talk to each other as if we were neighbours or something. Still, I did not expect my friend to forward all private info I exchange with him towards his girlfriend. Anyway, without asking or informing me, he told her everything that I had told him about my mother\u2019s accident. He also did not tell me that he told her about it. The next day I came over for a visit to their apartment. She greeted me and asked me if everything was alright, which was not an uncommon thing to occur (remember, we still maintained basic human interactions), to which I answered \"Yes, sure everything's fine\". At this point, I had no idea she knew about the accident. From my answer she must have come to the logical conclusion that I am not planning to tell her about my mother's accident. She then promptly switches topics and started mocking me that she found something online that I most definitely have not yet seen (being a meme lord, I usually know memes way before they find their way to my friend's phones). She made it sound as if she was going to show me a meme that she was sure I had not yet seen. She then proceeds to show me the news article on her phone of how my mother crashed and almost died (the severity of the injuries was detailed in the news article). I took this essentially as a mocking \"nananana I already know, you sure didn't see that one coming\".", "I despise your friend.", "I don't buy that you weren't rude to her. You may not have gone out of your way to say rude things, but your whole attitude about her is dripping with disdain, and you didn't make any attempts to hide that. YTA", "Dude, you're holding a grudge about her not oozing enthusiasm after you and your pal were away. You have deep resentment and you pulled a fuck around and find out where you put your buddy in the middle between you and his girlfriend. The buddy who is your landlord. You don't think she has any influence about your future as a tenant when she hates you for reasons you refuse to understand? You are wrong. She is deeply embedded in your buddy's family and only his brother sees you in a favorable light. Everyone else accepts you're an asshole on your buddy's word. You should have repaired the misunderstandings, if they're actually misunderstandings, when his brother clued you in. Now you're risking your social circle and living situation. \n\nI think you gravely overestimate your intelligence compared to the girlfriend's and she has your number. Soon it'll be apparent why you're being ousted, its likely because you act high and mighty about yourself and lacked the emotional intelligence to maintain a friendship with your buddy because it was obvious you were rude all along to everyone but you.\n\nEdit: she should have been of great interest to you if you valued peace in your social circle and in your living situation. Because she doesn't have her name on papers makes you think she doesn't take interest in it, but she thinks you suck and therefore can use soft power to influence your social standing among her inlaws and in your landlord-tenant situation. But keep dismissing her as unintelligent, uninteresting, etc and find yourself unhoused and friendless.", "She's turned into something more than a girlfriend when she got pregnant, and that's when you should have sucked it up and pretended to like her from then on. You were horrible to her when she came over for dinner (how could you possibly think she wouldn't?) and then you completely ghosted them when they lost their child. YTA to the max.", ">She is unintelligent. Yes, that's not a nice thing to say. But she is. She knows that she is. He knows that she is. And that's okay. \n\nJFC.  You really are an AH.  And condescending to boot.  You're just not a good human.  \n\nYou know that you are.  And that's okay.  LOL. \n\n>My disrespect was not initiated by her being unintelligent or uninteresting. My disrespect was started by her being abusive towards me.\n\nHow odd that she would disrespect someone who call her stupid and treats her like she is stupid.\n\nQuelle surprise!\n\n>I am the kind of guy who will answer questions directly and honestly, even if others would try to find words that make them seem like less of an AH than they actually are. I am not trying to be deceiving here. I want answers.\n\n\nGood.  You're a condescending and patronizing AH. \n\nYou remind me of the AHs at the gym who leave their trash all over the machines because they feel intellectually superior to the cleaning staff and therfore they don't warrant the basic respect of not having to clean up a grown adults mess.  \n\nNow you know. \n\n\n>Anyway, thanks for your time. If you find this interesting, please feel free to ask more questions. I want to get to the core of it.\n\nThe core of it is that you're a bad person.  \n\nYour friend's GF was smart enough to clock that. \n\nYou also mention you had \"other issues\" with him which are likely your fault.", "In what ways has she abused you?", "Admittedly, that was a bad way to phrase is by myself.\n\nI do initially have a basic, average respect for everybody, as should be normal. But if somebody repeatedly mistreats me for absolutely no reason, the respect will decay.\n\nBeing stupid and uninteresting is no reason to be disrespectful to somebody. But being stupid, uninteresting PLUS being unfriendly towards only me? I don't see how that leaves a lot of room for respect. But yes, this is vicious circle.", "We were eating chicken teriyaki with special plates to serve teriyaki style sauce in. I only have 4 pieces of every dish element. With her boyfriend we were four people.\n\nShe brought along pasta in a pan, so I showed her a pasta plate and ask her if she was okay to use that pasta plate for her pasta. She noded.\n\nNothing felt off at this point, until her boyfriend arrived. She then immediately burst into tears and they ran off shortly after.\n\nAfterwards they told their relatives that I had essentially thrown her out after attempting to make her eat out of a bowl.", "You're attributing so much logic and motivation to someone you have said is an idiot.  \n\nI am also suspicious of these stories since I think you're trying to justify your comments in the original post. \n\nBut it is striking to me that you think she is both stupid, but smart enough to get under your skin.  And that her feelings should be discarded but yours should be respected.", "Sadly, many of his ex-friends do so too.\n\nA lot of friendships were canceled because of weird conflicts that he greatly contributed to.\n\nBut he has been a very long-time friend for me and this was basically my last attempt to keep in touch. With devastating results.", "I understand how you interpeted it this way. Maybe my example I have given in the reply to wildferalfun will give you an idea of how I my disrespect for her started.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your time.", "She probably didn't immediately praise OPs vastly superior intellect. \ud83d\ude44", "Have you considered that while YOU view her this way others don't? I'm sorry but what they do in their relationship isn't indicative of how they actually are. And  saying you don't respect her because YOU find her uninteresting and stupid is so rude. What if she finds you to be uninteresting and stupid? I find you to be stupid at the very least, and you probably are uninteresting to a good half of the people you've met. You are not so important that your basis for how interesting or intelligent someone is, is the standard of respect. Genuinely you have growing up to do. I could understand if off the bat she was rude and unfriendly but I get the sense that the first thing you clocked was her intelligence and how important you find her to be personally.", "You think chicken teriyaki is some complex, high stress dish?  \n\nOh I see you're still gonna play like you weren't being rude before the boyfriend came.", "And truthfully I don't care for the backpeddling. You made a very open and shut statement that you don't respect people who haven't done anything to earn it. There is no other way to spin that aside from you only respect those who particularly stand out to you, not in general.", "Fair point. There is nothing I can do to convince you but I really did not disrespect or dislike her from the get-go and I really don't have negativ default respect for people.\n\nBut again, people who are neither friendly, nor interesting, nor intelligent hardly leave any room for respect.", "But above you admitted that you were disrespecting her first, and that's what led to the conflict between you. Can you keep your story straight?", "OP, a man of vastly superior intellect, clearly cannot.  \n\nApparently he was super stressed when she came to the door which is why he didn't handle the \"conflict\" well because he was making super complex chicken teriyaki.  \n\nHowever he was also a gracious host who spoke normally to the girlfriend while she was there waiting for her boyfriend and then she just randomly burst into tears for absolutely no reason."]}
