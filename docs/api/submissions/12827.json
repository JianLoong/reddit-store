I was a bit annoyed that she woke me up, so I went to the kitchen to grab a glass of water and use the restroom. I tried to stay as sleepy as possible to fall back asleep quickly.\n\nWhen I returned to bed, my SO told me to wash my hands, as she had apparently heard me in the restroom and noticed that I forgot to wash them in my half-asleep state. I told her that I just wanted to go back to sleep and didn't want to argue since I had sprained my ankle a bit earlier in the evening. However, she continued to ask me to wash my hands repeatedly. After some back and forth, I decided to sleep in the guest room instead of our bed.\n\nI am aware that I should wash my hands after using the restroom, but I was annoyed that my SO wouldn't drop the issue, and I couldn't fall back asleep until about 5:30AM.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up in a bad mood, and my SO asked me jokingly why I had slept in the guest room. I told her that I had slept there because she woke me up for the dog and wouldn't drop the handwashing issue. I expected an apology from her since I thought waking me up for the dog was inappropriate. However, she told me that it was my fault for not washing my hands and that I should have tried harder to fall back asleep. She said I was being dramatic and needed to get over it.\n\nI got frustrated because I had asked her to drop the issue several times during the night, but she had ignored me. I got angry and told her that I should have washed my hands but that waking me up for the dog's comfort was ridiculous and that she should have dropped it when I asked her to. I then told her not to talk to me until she had something else to say besides \"you are overreacting.\" She left for work, and I am now typing this in my home office, feeling upset.\n\nWe are at a standstill where I feel like I need an apology, and she feels like I am being dramatic. I tend to get angry quickly when I am sleep-deprived, so I know that I may be in the wrong here.

How many times do you scratch yourself in your sleep and don't wash your hands?", "NTA\n\nIm sorry, I assume you and your SO are physically intimate, maybe even exchange special \u201cfavors.\u201d Why the heck is she so grossed out about pee pee germs now?", ">Also, waking you up at that time of the morning? Unfair. I suggest the next time something like \"dog evicted from bed\" happens, wake her up at bum-o'clock in the morning. See how she likes it.\n\n\nOP **did** wake her up at bum-o\u2019clock in the morning for something like \u201cdog evicted from bed\u201d when he evicted the dog from the bed at bum-o\u2019clock in the morning.", "I understand the point this comment is making about the gf's overall attitude about germs, and about how having a pet is a much more unclean choice than most people think, but I don't think is grounds for avoiding the fact that a grown adult failed to wash their hands after using the restroom. \n\nThis is a partner that touches household surfaces, their SO, food - and unlike a dog, who physically does not have the means to wash it's paws or clean itself (for the most part), a grown human always has a choice to wash their hands. \n\nYes, having a dog is dirty, and stinky, and there are particles - loads of particles. but this is such poor hygiene for a grown adult. Rake me over the coals for saying it, but I think this is a YTA. Just because a dog is objectively dirty doesn't mean you shouldn't wash your hands??", "Bunch of nasty piss hands in here it's wild", "Have you washed your hands this week?", "I'm convinced it's a ton of men. Like what the hell. My cat sleeps on my bed and I always wash my hands. I constantly touch my face with em. I dont want my own fecal matter on it.", "As an adult, washing your hands should just be habit? Like it would wake me up more to consciously decide not to wash my hands vs just washing them on autopilot.", "I really don't think you are the one who should apologize. Your wife is extremely petty and selfish to wake you up to tell you about the dog (why in the hell?) and fight about stupid shit like washing your hands (unless you have poop on your hands, it's really not a big deal) in the middle of the night. Guess she doesn't give a shit about your sleep and she doesn't have the maturity to realize this and apologize.\n\nBut ah well, you are married to her and you need to get along. Indeed it's not worth staying upset about this, a happy family life is more important.", "For me it\u2019s because he has the cleanliness of a toddler", "Don't sweat the petty things, and don't pet the sweaty things. :P", "very mature and very true response! thank u", "I appreciate and admire your self awareness here, and even though not washing your hands is kinda ew I still think you're NTA.", "I would even say NAH everyone is just tired as this happened in the middle of the night.  I say apologize for not washing your hands, and expression your feelings about her waking you up about the dog, if she doesn't apologize or at least acknowledges your feelings then she becomes the AH.", "That's the mature way of solving this, way to go OP.", "People shouldn't be able to sleep if they know their hands aren't washed, the disgust should keep them awake until they get up and clean themselves - then they can relax/fall asleep. I had no idea so many people were so gross.", "I sit every time at home. I don't see a point in risking making a mess", "True. I sleepwalk and every time I wash my hands with soap", "Uhm, we don't need to hold our dick to pee, it holds itself....", "Sounds like OP also normally does it. If you forgot to do this once, would you appreciate your partner telling you to go back, causing you to wake up completely and not be able to fall back asleep?\n\n\"Thank you partner, if you didn't wake me up for this, I would've slept with unwashed hands. Imagine the horror.\"", "Haha! Welcome to No-Nut-Ever!", "People who let their dogs and cats lick their faces weird me out for the exact same reason. This is a man who\u2019s happy to say how much he loves his cats (even though they are often total assholes. \n\nThey know exactly how little standards dogs have in what goes in their mouth. I\u2019ve seen dogs happily eating cat food, wild animals, roadkill or any random food they can find, French fries, sweets (including a mars bar I\u2019d thrown up one time after smoking too much weed - so foul and funny at the same time!)\n\nI\u2019ve heard people try to explain the reasons why animals are somehow genetically more hygienic than human tongues. I\u2019m not buying it. That shit is gross."]}
