I was a bit annoyed that she woke me up, so I went to the kitchen to grab a glass of water and use the restroom. I tried to stay as sleepy as possible to fall back asleep quickly.\n\nWhen I returned to bed, my SO told me to wash my hands, as she had apparently heard me in the restroom and noticed that I forgot to wash them in my half-asleep state. I told her that I just wanted to go back to sleep and didn't want to argue since I had sprained my ankle a bit earlier in the evening. However, she continued to ask me to wash my hands repeatedly. After some back and forth, I decided to sleep in the guest room instead of our bed.\n\nI am aware that I should wash my hands after using the restroom, but I was annoyed that my SO wouldn't drop the issue, and I couldn't fall back asleep until about 5:30AM.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up in a bad mood, and my SO asked me jokingly why I had slept in the guest room. I told her that I had slept there because she woke me up for the dog and wouldn't drop the handwashing issue. I expected an apology from her since I thought waking me up for the dog was inappropriate. However, she told me that it was my fault for not washing my hands and that I should have tried harder to fall back asleep. She said I was being dramatic and needed to get over it.\n\nI got frustrated because I had asked her to drop the issue several times during the night, but she had ignored me. I got angry and told her that I should have washed my hands but that waking me up for the dog's comfort was ridiculous and that she should have dropped it when I asked her to. I then told her not to talk to me until she had something else to say besides \"you are overreacting.\" She left for work, and I am now typing this in my home office, feeling upset.\n\nWe are at a standstill where I feel like I need an apology, and she feels like I am being dramatic.

It's just when the germs contain specific diseases is the cause of suffering.\n\n I think the whole nagging to wash the hand stuff was all about control. I would have moved out for at least a few days. Give the other party time to think about leaving me alone when I'm asleep", "...I was agreeing w you", "I love it.", "that tracks and tbh some days i do feel like a corpse!", "and hopefully, secrete and ejaculate other fluids too. \n\nas well as sneeze & cough. \n\nthe bed is \"clean\" for a very short period of time even with strict hygiene regimen", "Actually I change my pillow case every night.  It helps my hair and skin stay clean.  Not sure about the sweat cause I don\u2019t sleep hot and I wear pjs to bed.", "Considering you don't have to get in bed already dirty if you shower and there are things called mattress protectors and washing machines, it definitely is hyperbole.\n\nNow if you don't wash your ass (which i guess you don't if you get in bed already dirty) and sweat and drool and don't wash your sheets and mattress protector, then yeah your bed is filthy. But since you don't see why someone would ask someone to wash their hands after peeing, it would make sense for you to assume everyone also has bad hygiene.", "Valid, but still wash your hands! I feel like after the past few years we can agree as a society that people generally don\u2019t wash their hands enough.", "Thank you for making my point. Absolutely rancid.", "It\u2019s interesting seeing the anti-hand washing crowd attempt to justify their lack of basic hygiene. \n\nTruly a Redditor moment.", "Who farts in bed when they are sleeping with someone else? I wouldn't even do that by myself. Do you do this to people? You fart while under the same sheets in the same bed?", "Personally I would prefer to not bring pee or other bacteria back into my bed. I also sleep with someone else and it would be very very inconsiderate to not wash my hands. That being said I don't wake up to pee, maybe once a year.", "Easy to spot the forever alone crowd in here.", "If she was writing this post I would have told her the same thing, apologize for waking him and keeping him up. He\u2019s the one who wrote this about his behavior. This is certainly a situation that is not worth it to be dragged out. Better communication will go a lot further.", "Yes to the first thing, no to the second. \n\nYou could have washed your hands if you wanted to, but there is no real reason to do so. Nothing will happen if you don\u2019t. \n\nIf she\u2019s hypersensitive to the idea of germs then it might be the kind thing to do for her, but if she\u2019s normally worried about germs, it really does just sound like she was trying to pick at fight over nothing at 3am. Your only folly was taking the bait and not letting go.", "Well, it was your hypothetical", "I mean not really though? His dick hangs out next to his butthole all day mixing around with the fecal matter, sweat and germs in his underwear. It's no where near \"just as clean\" as any other part of his body. I doubt you would say that the skin around your vagina was just as clean as any other skin on your body, same goes for dude genitals. \n\nDoes this mean I think he was required and should have been hounded to wash his hands right then in the middle of the night? No, it may be a little gross but it's really not that big of a deal and is understandable if the goal is just to empty the bladder so you can go back to sleep. I know I've been guilty of it too so I'm not going to fault anyone else for it.", "What? I was just saying that your response made no sense because if it was really about \"waking up too much\" he wouldn't have done the thing that would absolutely make him wake up.", "I'm made of 90% jokes, 5% anxiety, and 5% idiot. Thank you for noticing me \ud83d\ude46\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Kittie Roca!", "You mean poopy kisses?", ">willy wipe\n\nLol", "I agree. Depriving someone of sleep is ugly. Listening to someone in the bathroom to monitor that they've done it to your standards is a bit obsessive and intrusive!\n\nIf you reverse the genders, people would be up in arms calling the man abusive!", "Speaking of ejaculate, it\u2019s kind of funny how scared people are of a hand that\u2019s touched a penis, yet seem entirely willing to forget this when they\u2019re about to put their mouth on someone else\u2019s genitals. \n\nNot that I don\u2019t appreciate a pre-coital tidying up as much as the next person.", "Hey, I have a bidet. My crotch is pristine. \n\nBut yeah, your sheets get dirty the first night you use them. You shed skin cells nonstop, you sweat, your eyes make tears and eye boogies, you drool, scratch yourself. All this in absorbent fabric that creates a nice, warm, humid environment. \n\nWashing your sheets regularly cleans them when you do it, but it\u2019s not like they stay clean until you decide to wash your sheets.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that you should be scared of your bedsheets, just that washing your hands after peeing at 3am accomplishes nothing other than reinforcing the illusion of sterility.", "I just learned we breathe on each other too much. I\u2019m more concerned about a stranger sneezing in my face at the airport than whatever is on my crotch or in my bathroom. \n\nWe get too much virus exposure but not enough bacterial exposure. The latter is actually quite protective against allergies, IBD, and weakened immunity.", "And OP's partner's behavior in this instance was absolutely unreasonable. \"Yeah but you should wash your hands\" isn't really the point. Treating them like 1)garbage followed by 2)a kindergartner is the actual issue.", "> while good hygiene is important\n\n\nHardly anti-hand washing bud. But everyone slips up every now and then and shouldn\u2019t be crucified over it.", "You can tell he sleeps alone with his insistence everyone just farts on each other.", "I hate to break this to you, but people fart involuntarily in their sleep. It\u2019s funny you think I\u2019m the forever alone. If you even had shared a bed with a single person, you\u2019d know people sleep fart.", "it was initially about waking up too much\n\nonce they started bickering about it, he was awake one way or another, but if he just washed his hands and came back to bed, he would be tossing and turning for the rest of the night fighting the resentment\n\nacting it out and moving to a guest bedroom is a better solution in that moment", "Literally vomited in my mouth. He likes to dig it out of the sand and dirt in the backyard so not much roca", "yep.", "Just because we\u2019re regularly exposed to germs doesn\u2019t mean we should stop washing our hands. I don\u2019t want to come in contact with anyone\u2019s breath but I also don\u2019t want to come in contact with their genitals because they couldn\u2019t be bothered to wash their hands. Kids are taught to wash their hands after using the bathroom or putting their hands down their pants and I think we can hold similar expectations for adults.", "We definitely don't fart on each other in bed. Not my kink but good on you.", "I get what you mean, but he had said himself he still felt resentful all night and in the morning despite sleeping elsewhere lol", "I mean, I don\u2019t think anyone is saying to never wash your hands. Just that not washing them after peeing at 3am is not  terribly high yield when it comes to preventing infectious diseases, which is the whole purpose of washing our hands.", "well, yeah, I don't think some people realize how big of a deal is waking somebody up in the middle of the night is\n\na lot of the people won't be able to go back to sleep, will feel tired all day after and might be kicked out of their sleep cycle for several night after that, it's the definition of AH to attack you SO's wellbeing like that for no freaking reason, I'd be pissed too", "I don\u2019t think anyone is talking about getting an infectious disease from peeing. It\u2019s being polite to the partner that you share a bed with and also following basic societal norms.", "...you realize that she was also half asleep right? \n\nShe wasn't intentionally \"attacking\" anyone's wellbeing. Y'all are so quick to decide how this woman is based on one bad interaction my goodness.", "no she was up on a mission to make OP do shit for her, nobody was not letting her sleep"]}
