My eldest daughter got married two years ago, I paid for the whole thing, my youngest daughter recently got engaged and plans on having her wedding on spring. \n\nAs I said I paid for my eldest daughter as her wedding was something that she wanted and was sure about, she and her husband (m29) have been together since she was 20, they know each other and I think he's a good man. However my youngest daughter's fiance is a way older man (m46) who I couldn't even believe my daughter was dating. He's got a divorce and has kids that are teenagers. I disapproved the relationship ever since my daughter introduced us to her boyfriend. Me and my eldest daughter tried speaking to her about how creepy her boyfriend is but she has said that she's an adult and can date anyone she likes. \n\nWhen she announced her engagement she asked if I was going to pay for her wedding too as I promised. I told her that I will not because she knows I don't approve this relationship. I remembered her that she told us that she's an adult and can do whatever she wants, that's okay, then she needs to face the adult consequences of her actions. If she wants to marry then she needs to pay for it, that's it. I told her once again that this is a mistake but she called me an asshole and claimed I was favouring my eldest daughter because I said nothing about her fiance, I explained why her sister's relationship was different but she didn't wanted to hear me. \n\nMy parents think that I need to support her to show her that I love her and if she realizes later that she made a mistake she can trust me to support her then. I am unsure about that, I think that since she doesn't want to listen to my advice then she shouldn't feel entitled to my money, she know how much I love her but that doesn't mean I have to be supportive of her poor choices.\n\nEdit: some people are confused, I am a man.\n\nThey have been dating for around six/ seven months. They met in college, my daughter is a student and he's a basketball coach.", "created_utc": 1676990841, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/118543o/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_my_daughters/", "score": 8712, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Only that support doesn't have to be financing a wedding to a creep twice her age. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter may be heading down a dangerous road, and if she finds herself in need of help, she'll be a lot better off if she knows she can count on you. So show her that she can. Tell her that even though you cannot support this wedding out of concern for her, you'll keep the money you saved for it set aside in case *she* needs it in the future.

I don't typically like when people add strings attached to a promise after the fact but this is different. For those that are saying you're just trying to control her with money... the man is twice her age, she's only recently an adult herself. You're right, if she is adult enough to make the decision to marry such an older man, she's old enough to pay for the wedding, with her middle-aged fiance. Plus, one reason parents pay for their kids wedding is because the 'kids' are just starting off and won't have much in savings. He's a middle-aged man, so that excuse is gone.

If she was marrying someone who you didn\u2019t like for petty reasons and you said no I\u2019d say you\u2019re probably TA.

Rightfully so! I'd try to focus on the fact that your older daughter and her husband were starting their lives together, paying for the wedding was a gift so they could have an event that was (presumably) above their means. Youngest daughter is joining someone else's established life. Paying for her wedding is also paying for someone else's second wedding. That's the choice she's making, and I'd make that clear.", "NTA - Parents paying for weddings is really predicated on the idea that you\u2019re helping set them up for their adult life. It presumes the bride and groom are young adults and help is socially acceptable. \n\nIn this case, she\u2019s marrying someone who has already been married, divorced, is raising children and could in fact be her father, age-wise.

Someone who has barely experienced the world as an adult? Why isn\u2019t he interested in dating women closer to his own age? \n\nI just hope OP can preserve the relationship with his daughter enough to remain a safe person to call when this relationship implodes.", "NTA. No one thinks that their kid will marry someone twice their age, so I see why you didn\u2019t put a condition on the wedding.

I dont think you should pay for her wedding, but i do think that you may need to make some concessions to maintain a relationship with her, for when this marriage inevitably falls apart, and for the love of GOD do not let her have kids with the old dude. the dude sounds sketch AF and the last thing she needs is to be baby locked to a boomer in 5 years", "NTA say the money is saved for her - it wont be lost - for if she needs it outside the marriage. But it cant be used for marriage or the benefit of the man she wants to marry. Tell her he is old enough to pay for his own wedding unlike two young people at the start of their lives.", "NTA. You are dealt with a very difficult situation. You disapprove because the man is old enough to be her father. I'd talk with her and offer to cover some expenses to show that you love her. Tell her you love her but only support her half of the relationship and you will pay her half of the wedding.\n\nEDIT: some people need to relax with these YTA. OP doesn't want her daughter marrying a creep. It's not like she's refusing to pay an interracial or same sex marriage or something along those lines. When she agrees to pay for her daughter's wedding it was under the assumption her daughter wouldn't be with a potential predator", "NTA, your concerns are valid. The age gap is ceeepy. Although your daughter is going to hate you and might cut you off for breaking your promise. Also, a 46 year old, divorced person should be able to afford his own wedding. It's a no-win scenario for you, OP.  Anyway, communication with your daughter is going to be the key.", "I know I\u2019m gonna get downvoted but NTA. Yes you need to support your daughter, but I see that the fianc\u00e9 is man who is older than you are. Maybe work out some sort of compromise with him to pay for it? You\u2019re gonna need to support your daughter lovingly and emotionally bc this is a nightmare waiting to happen", "NTA. if that man paid for his first wedding he can also pay for the second, if he even payed for the first one that is. \n\nhe\u2019s old enough to be her father, that\u2019s weird, especially depending on how long they\u2019ve been together/ when they started talking to one another.", "NTA. \n\nYou're not paying because you don't approve of this marriage.  If you had college funds but refused to let your kid use hers to attend a non-accredited school to study aromatherapy or crystal healing that would be the equivalent.", "NTA, she very adamantly said \u201c I\u2019m an adult and can date whoever I want .\u201d Okay adult now pay for yourself and be an adult. When you made that promise I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t know your daughter would make such a silly and dumb decision.

You\u2019re not. It\u2019s your money and if you don\u2019t want it used for something you do not support, you have that right, whether or not you promised something originally. \n\nYour daughter may be an adult but that does not mean you have to support her, especially monetarily, in her decisions. And her decision making seems to be really poor in this case. She\u2019s indicated that she\u2019s an adult who can do what she wants, and that\u2019s true she can. That now includes planning and paying for her wedding. \n\nOne caveat: be aware that she may decide to exclude you from her life moving forward, as a result. It\u2019s just the way the situation may play out if you both stand your ground.", "NTA.. \n\nEven if you approve of their relationship, why can\u2019t this 46 years old afford his own wedding? I think one way you can go about this is set aside the amount you were willing to contribute into her wedding in your will for her (add a condition there if she received the money in some other way then it\u2019s null or something) and tell her it\u2019s not about the money and the money will be there for her.", "NTA\n\nAny offer to financially support your child's wedding comes with the implicit caveat that you're not going to pay for a wedding that makes you concerned about your child's safety. Your child marrying someone twice their age definitely fits those concerns.\n\nHowever, keep in mind by withdrawing your financial support, you are creating an \"us\" vs \"him\" situation. If your daughter digs her heels in and choose him, it might be harder to separate them down the road if he ends up living up to the \"older dude dating younger lady\" stereotype.", "NTA, a 46 year old man who is marrying a 23 year old should be able to pay for their wedding. Paying for a wedding when both are young and getting established makes sense, paying for an adult with 2 teenagers' wedding to your daughter feels wrong, and I think you are NTA for refusing to pay. I'm sure your daughter will be upset and this could damage your relationship, but honestly, I don't see much of a good relationship coming back after her wedding to a man twice her age with teenage children. Do a background check on this guy and contact the older guys ex to see why they divorced. Try to keep your daughter safe as possible.", "Ok OP, \nIn this situation, NTA. \n\nAs a 23 yr old myself, I would be lying if I told you that I\u2019ve never made dumb decisions in men in my life. However, her case is very different as she\u2019s marrying a man twice her age. Although she is technically an adult, it is very concerning that she built an entire relationship with a man in his mid 40s. If he\u2019s well established (which he should be), then he should pay for it then. But I feel that you should pay for her dress and makeup as you did promise her that you would contribute to her wedding.

It's a certain kind of stupidity that when combined with an older romantic partner who has an agenda... that makes us lost to reason.\n\nYou think this man is bad news for her? \n\nGuess what is one thing that keeps a bad partner from being their most worst? Caring invested family members of their victims. If he knows that her dad/mom is there, looking on, caring, willing to save her? That is what keeps your child safe. Throwing away the whole child because they're being \"i am in love and i know best\" that WE ALL get at that age? You are closing the door on her future safety too. \n\nGroomers and perps look to isolate their victims. When they have no-one to turn to, then those victims have a harder time getting out and getting help. You think this will go badly for her. Better to let her know that your doors are always open for her to leave a bad marriage rather than having her end up in a body bag.\n\nThis has NOTHING to do with paying for her wedding. It's about keeping her safe as possible after it happens. I assume you don't want her to be hurt or worse.", "Nta. I would back out too and deal with being called an AH or hypocrite by my child. Yeah, she's making a mistake with this creepy older guy and you have to finance this mistake with your own money. I'm a firm believer in equal treatment of siblings. But, no, no, no. Too bad, I'm an AH then. You know what? If their marriage actually lasts, at their ten year anniversary, throw them a huge party or vow renewal or pay a down payment for a house for them or give them a windfall with the money you would have spent on her wedding, plus inflation.

It\u2019s not about money it\u2019s about being there for your daughter. She may forgive you doing this but she will never forget. She\u2019ll never forget that you used money to try to control her decisions, that your support for her was conditional on her making choices that you approve of and that you were willing to let her go through a huge milestone alone because you were more concerned with being right than being there for her. \nShe will never trust you in the same way again - and if you\u2019re not her confidant then you lose any further opportunity to offer her guidance.

The fact of the matter is, there are some things people have to learn on their own and no amount of lectures or threats will talk her out of it.  Could you have been talked out of marrying your spouse?

Next, you have a few different options after talking. 1. You can choose to just pay for half. 2. You can offer to pay for full if she waits a little longer to get married (same age as her sister or same relationship length of time). 3.

I'm not saying the age gap isn't weird to me, too, but disapproving to the point that you won't keep a promise to your kid over *just that* is too much. You're prioritizing being right over being her parent, and sometimes that's justified and sometimes it's simply not. If you don't at the very least compromise, you are going to regret how it harms your relationship with her. What if she never realizes \"her mistake\" and ends up totally happy with this person? You're not considering that possibility because you're so doggedly certain you're correct. I just don't think this is the hill to die on.

My eldest daughter got married two years ago, I paid for the whole thing, my youngest daughter recently got engaged and plans on having her wedding on spring. \n\nAs I said I paid for my eldest daughter as her wedding was something that she wanted and was sure about, she and her husband (m29) have been together since she was 20, they know each other and I think he's a good man. However my youngest daughter's fiance is a way older man (m46) who I couldn't even believe my daughter was dating. He's got a divorce and has kids that are teenagers. I disapproved the relationship ever since my daughter introduced us to her boyfriend. Me and my eldest daughter tried speaking to her about how creepy her boyfriend is but she has said that she's an adult and can date anyone she likes. \n\nWhen she announced her engagement she asked if I was going to pay for her wedding too as I promised. I told her that I will not because she knows I don't approve this relationship. I remembered her that she told us that she's an adult and can do whatever she wants, that's okay, then she needs to face the adult consequences of her actions. If she wants to marry then she needs to pay for it, that's it. I told her once again that this is a mistake but she called me an asshole and claimed I was favouring my eldest daughter because I said nothing about her fiance, I explained why her sister's relationship was different but she didn't wanted to hear me. \n\nMy parents think that I need to support her to show her that I love her and if she realizes later that she made a mistake she can trust me to support her then. I am unsure about that, I think that since she doesn't want to listen to my advice then she shouldn't feel entitled to my money, she know how much I love her but that doesn't mean I have to be supportive of her poor choices.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I feel like that\u2019s the only scenario you\u2019ve planned for by doing this, is the failure of her marriage. If things go decently or actually go well (as unlikely as I feel that is), you\u2019ve either pushed her to cling more to him to avoid being wrong or, she is genuinely fine and you are just missing out in her life. Cuz after this? She\u2019s probably not going to want you around or be quite as close to you as she may be now. \n\nNAH honestly I don\u2019t think anything you could have done would have been in everyone\u2019s best interests, so I don\u2019t blame you for fixing on the one thing totally under your control. The only thing that fixes it all is if she decides not to be with him.

I couldn't support that either. He's double his age. Yes, it works out for some people, but... no. NTA", "NTA I think that the suggestions of either paying for half or just for things related to her (dress, hair, makeup, etc.) sounds like a good compromise.

When they divorced, the teen stepkids chose her. This all took place before she was 30. She was a great mom, but had a hard road raising four kids.

I know that you technically made a promise, but as a parent, I can understand your concerns. Plus, it\u2019s your money and you can do what you wish with it.", "NTA.  I get that you promised, so that's not great.  But why is the guy she's marrying, who's your age, okay with you paying?  That doesn't make any sense to me.  Isn't he embarrassed?  If anything, why isn't he paying for his own wedding to your daughter, and then you can put the money towards the grandchildren's college fund or something. I feel like you're in a lose/lose situation.  She already knows you don't approve, even if you pay.  If you pay, the future doesn't look bright for her.  Someone else suggested a good idea, that making a two-year engagement a requirement or something like that.  Your eldest was with her fiance for nine years.  That's plenty of time to get to know someone.  It is too soon for you to pay.  You barely know this guy.  I think that's your best bet.  It buys time for your daughter to see if this really is best.  You can't pay right now because you don't even know the guy is maybe the best direction.  If she's in a rush, she'll have to figure things out with her fiance then, and you're out of it.", "Agree with others here, put a time requirement on the engagement. I would go with two years. And, not as in planning the wedding for the next two years; as in we can start planning the wedding once you guys hit that mark, and then the wedding needs to be 6 months or more after that.\nI would also attach an additional stipulation that they attend couple's counseling, no less than twice a month, and offer to pay for it. \nI know at first that sounds controlling, but the truth is she needs to learn a few things in order for this relationship to actually be healthy. Most likely those things are: how to stand her ground, how to identify manipulative behavior, and healthy conflict resolution. \nJust explain that there's a huge potential for an imbalance of power here, and you want a professional to help guide her into getting ahead of it, so she can be an equal in her relationship.\nIn reality, the therapist will spot the  manipulation tactics this guy is probably using on her, and not let him gas light his way out of it. But, you don't have to tell her that. Seeing him get called out on things by someone he can't manipulate might eventually lead to an \"aha\" moment. \n\nHe will resist therapy, of course. If he refuses to participate, then from that point on, that can be the reason you use to not support the relationship/wedding, and she can't get mad.", "NTA, you\u2019re not going back on your promise because your favour her sister, but because you don\u2019t approve of her choice. It\u2019s ridiculous of her to try and pull that card. Plus paying for a wedding is common because young adults usually can\u2019t afford huge parties. A man going on fifty marrying a woman half his age can pay his own bills. This is a creepy situation and just because you can\u2019t stop it that doesn\u2019t mean you should support it. \n\nPaying half would still support it, so there\u2019s no way I\u2019d suggest that as others have. Instead, make it clear you\u2018ll be there if she changes her mind and will not say \u201cI told you so\u201c.

If that\u2019s all it is, then I\u2019ll say YTA\u2026 not because of whether you\u2019ll pay for a wedding, but because you\u2019re trying to dictate your adult daughter\u2019s choice of partner. If it crashes and burns, that\u2019s her business. Now, do I personally think that it\u2019s a recipe for disaster? Maybe.

Just support her in ways you are comfortable with. \n\nNTA and the older dude is gross.", "Paying for it condones it. You\u2019re an adult.

(Seriously, parents need to stop promising to hand out large chunks of money w/o some basic - but fair - stipulations.)\n\nIs there anything else you can do to \"be fair\" but also give your daughter protection? For example, does he own a home? Can you give money for the wedding on the condition that her name is on the property? I know putting conditions on the money may not go over well, but at the same time, his reluctance may open her eyes a little. There may be other possibilities to add in a protection for your daughter. (Student loans or credit card debt you can offer to pay off instead?) You know the situation much better than I and your daughter's level of stubbornness, so only try something like this if you think your daughter would not freak out and distance herself b/c of the stipulation. Talk to her mom and sister to see if they have any knowledge of something that may work.\n\nIn any event, I do think it is best to fork over the money and pay for the wedding. You can't control who your daughter marries and as distasteful as this situation is, you promised.

I take more issue with that than their age-gap tbh. While I think most age-gap relationships are probably unhealthy,  I still think that in some cases, it can work under ideal circumstances. Furthermore, I think it's wrong how people ostracize and further isolate the younger person in the relationship because they often need a strong support system if they need to exit. \n\nBut seriously, not even a year?

Yeah,  I feel this poor girl is at the mercy of a narcissistic old man,  and she's being used hard-core for supply.  Guys like these manipulate and use.

You are supposed to disclose the relationship if there is one BEFORE you sign those documents. At the time of disclosure, he may not have been in a relationship with her. However, he would also then need to sign a Code of Conduct which would state that he is not to enter a romantic relationship with anyone over whom he has authority. You cannot disclose after the fact because he already breached the code of conduct.

If you have no direct influence, or possible direct influence  (ie you won't eventually be their teacher), over the student, it is not a violation of any kind, but it is a 'cover your butt' move to still disclose it so that leadership knows about it and can decide to take action if needed. Ie, if he's the men's basketball and she's on the women's team, he might think there is no conflict of interest, but leadership might disagree given they are both involve basketball.", "I was on the side of the daughter at first, even though huge age gaps gross me out, BUT the fact that she's only 23 and they've only been together for just over half a year, is VERY CONCERNING. Definitely sounds like grooming, and he definitely sounds like a predator. However, I don't think OP should outright say these things to his daughter. I think he should support her in other ways, even if it's not paying, so if things inevitably go wrong in the marriage, OP will be there to help her. I can't imagine how embarrassed she'd be in that situation, let alone how she'd swallow her pride to ask for help from someone who openly judged her..."]}
