My parents used to leave me in the car allllllll the time and I figured I'd be in the no more than 10 minutes so I conceded. I left the car on, she had climate control, a cracked window, left her my phone to play games on, and we went over the protocol (she locked the doors after I left and was only supposed to unlock them when I came back to the car) She's a smart kid and knows stranger danger protocol too. There was a short line at the check cashing counter but I was in the store for no more than 15 minutes. When I came out of the store I could hear my daughter crying and screaming so of course I went running ready to murder someone for trying to steal my child. Instead I found her safe in the car but a man standing by the window trying to talk to her. As soon as they saw me she starts screaming for me and he looks angry and starts screamingat me too. He's yelling at me for leaving my child in the car. I tell him that she was perfectly fine and in no risk of overheating considering its winter and the car was on. He continues to berate me and called me a bad mother for leaving her in the car. Meanwhile my daughter has unlocked the door and climbed into my arms. I ask her what happened while I was in the store and she tells me that she was just playing her game on my phone when \"a scary stranger approached me, scared me, and started asking me about my parents. I was scared so I started crying.\" He's still yelling at me and making a huge scene so then an employee gets involved and tells the man he should have minded his own business. Apparently she had been doing cart return and witnessed the whole thing. She had seen that my daughter was fine until the man approached her. So then I start yelling back at the man telling him that HE scared my daughter and he should be ashamed of himself for causing such distress to my child. I get ready to leave because I have had enough of the whole situation and it was getting close to dinner time so I had more important things to do like feed my child (and calm her down). At that point he tells me that he's called the cops and he's going to stand behind my car until they got there so that we couldn't leave. I tried to get him to leave, but he wouldn't budge and when the cops arrived they took statements from everyone. All I got was a talking to and a warning but some of his words really got to me.\n\nEdit: I just want to throw in here that we were at a very crowded Kroger grocery in a VERY safe neighborhood. And it's NOT ILLEGAL in my state. Also, if I thought my kid was even the slightest bit immature enough to mess with my car, I wouldn't have considered it but I thought she has been taught enough to know not to mess with the car. She plays with the radio and the climate control, that's it. Also we both learned from the situation. I know that no matter the situation, I'll be dragging her into wherever I am going. And she has also said that she learned from the situation and will never try to get me to let her stay in the car again. She also asked if she could take self-defense classes which I thought was incredibly mature of her. So now I'm looking into mommy & me self defense classes (no that doesn't exist, but I'm trying to find somewhere that has a class we can both take.)\n\nEdit 2: I'm sorry this post seems to be triggering some people so badly.

In the moment it seems like a harmless decision. I was left in the car too, when I was a kid. It\u2019s so tough, sometimes. \n\nI think of it this way. There is a jar on the table with 10,000 jellybeans. One of them is poison. The odds are beyond excellent that if you eat one, you\u2019re fine. But the permanent fallout of the one poison candy outweighs that 9999/10000. It\u2019s like that with leaving a kid in the car. You\u2019ll come back to her 9999/10000 times. But that 1/10000? Imagine how your stomach drops. Imagine how you can\u2019t even speak, can\u2019t even breathe. Imagine how your mind screams \u201cnononononoNONONONONONOOOOOOOOOO!!!\u201d \n\nImagine what happens next. \n\nDrag the kid into the bank. Ten minutes of attitude is worth it. \n\nThe gentlest YTA to you.", "I have no idea if Y T A but I'll say my piece.  \n\nI'm almost 40.  I, with my brother, or alone, were left in the car 100 times when someone ran into the convenience store or similar.  It was what was done in the 80's. \n\nAnd in comparison, the 80's had significantly higher crime.  People are saying look up horror stories online.  We didn't have online horror stories back then so who knows. \n\nChild rearing, and children today seem a lot different.  I don't have kids.  I don't know if I understand what's happened with raising children.  I'm not trying to be a boomer and say \"WE USED TO DO IT THIS WAY\".  It just seems they're raised a lot differently and a lot more protectively now.    It seems like suburban kids don't even have friends outside of school anymore half the time.  They come home and they're home.  Not riding bikes all over the world in roving packs getting into horseplay. \n\nI also don't have a lot of friends with kids or discuss parenting with the ones I do because I don't have kids.  If I were to have a kid today, who knows what society would think about my notions of how to raise one. \n\nBut most of all, I have no idea where you live and the area you did this in.  I live in a rural area with not a lot going on these days.  When I was a kid, I lived in one of the most populated non-city areas in the country.  \n\nI don't think anyone would bat an eye out here.  I've probably seen it at the local mart or the feed store 100 times and didn't even register it as odd.  \n\nAnd if I did, and I started hounding the kid or berating the parent, I'd probably get a good smack in the mouth for it.", "Personally I think it depends on the child and how they were raised if one is to leave them alone for a few minutes. In your case NTA. Your kid understood what to do and handled it appropriately. A lot of people will say YTA and only see a kids age and say \"You shouldn't leave a child alone!\". So when is it viable to do so? 8? 11? A person's age doesn't equate to maturity or common sense.", "NTA.\n\nThe people freaking out about stranger danger and the perceived risks of leaving your child alone in a car while you go into a store have been watching too many cable news programs.\n\nThe [law in California](https://www.costamesaca.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=703) only prohibits leaving children age 6 or younger in cars unattended A) if the car is running or B) if conditions (like heat or cold) make pose a significant danger to the child's health or safety.\n\nI can't speak for other states, but leaving a 7 year-old alone in a car is perfectly legal in California. That's because stranger abduction is incredibly rare. And, when it happens, it's almost always on the way to or from school, not from a locked car outside of a store.\n\nAfter the man scared the crap of your child, he should have moved away and left her alone. By blocking you from leaving, he may have thought of himself as effecting a citizen's arrest, but unlawful imprisonment is a closer fit. He is the AH here, not you.", "I just read over on r/legal of a similar situation in NJ. Little girl was 5 yrs old. Mom ran into Costco for 30 minutes. Police were called. Child was taken to ER to be checked. CPS was called in and mom might be looking at criminal charges. You\u2019re NTA but you need to count yourself lucky you aren\u2019t in serious trouble with the law and that that man wasn\u2019t some pervert who could have gotten to your child. Learn a very valuable life lesson. Take responsibility for your poor decision rather than blame the man for blocking your exit. He may have been out of line yelling at you and upsetting your child but he wasn\u2019t the irresponsible adult in this situation. You were. Own it!", "In these circumstances he\u2019s definitely the overstepping nosey AH that needs to mind his buisness and not be a creeper that\u2019s peering into peoples windows. Unfortunately the world is a messed up place with lots of bad people and anything can happen, so it\u2019s probably for the best that you\u2019ve decided to just drag her along from now on. That being said, my kids are 5 and 2 and it\u2019s super tempting to leave them in the car when I have a <5 minute errand to run and I don\u2019t want to wrangle 2 kids out and back in to their car seats (I don\u2019t actually do it, I just sometimes wish I could) so I totally get where you\u2019re coming from.", "NTA. If you haven\u2019t read anything by Lenore Skenazy of Free Range Parenting yet, I recommend it. You\u2019ll feel more secure in your decision.", "Jesus Christ. People suck these days. Kids used to literally walk miles to the store to pick up groceries or go to school at 7 years old. Yes you can leave your kid in the car for a few minutes, especially when they are at an age where they are capable of finding you, getting out of the car themselves etc. \n\nFFS. Soon we're going to have to have babysitters for 17 year olds. \ud83d\ude44 NTA.", "My issue would be that check cashing places aren't generally the safest areas, you know? But maybe now your kid will be too scared to stay in the car in the future.", "[deleted]", "Go look up some horror stories online you\u2019ll figure out why YTA", "Hate to break it to you, but YTA here.\n\nSure, you thought it was safe to leave your kid in the car running, but glass can break, and someone could have taken the car AND your child.  The guy was doing what he thought was right--I would have not spoken to your daughter, but called the police, but still.  You don't leave your child in a car for any reason under any circumstances.", "YTA for so many reasons. Being a parent means making your kid follow directions at times, even when they don\u2019t want to. Leaving them in a car alone is not the right answer. Someone could have broken a window and kidnapped your child and/or stolen your vehicle. Your daughter could have played around in the car and shifted the gears and caused an accident.", "I'm going to say ESH. I understand having an intelligent child but you learned today that despite her maturity and understanding of things you two have talked about, being in the moment is miles different than coming up with safety scenarios. Her response was to panic. If this had been a real situation, a real emergency, that panic very well could have gotten her hurt, or stolen. She is not ready to be alone in a car for that long. You mistook her intelligence for preparedness. It happens, people aren't perfect.\n\nAside from that, you're also the AH for escalating the situation. If she climbed out of the car crying her eyes out and clinging to you, going off on the stranger didn't help. You made a stressful situation more stressful. Yelling at him had no positive outcome here, except maybe to make you feel better for a few seconds. \n\nHe's the AH because while he was a concerned citizen, he didn't have to approach the situation like that at all. Who approaches a child alone in a car and interrogates them? If he thought she shouldn't be alone he could have just called the police to begin with and made a report, and then watched from a distance so as not to terrify your kid. \n\nI'm so sorry she had to go through all of this. Adults made mistakes at every turn with her today.", "YTA - 1000% you are.  An ill-intentioned person could have shattered the vehicle window and your daughter could have vanished in less than 30 seconds.  I cannot believe anyone would be foolish enough to do something like that in this day and age.  He was totally an AH as to how he went about it, but if he scared you into sense, then that man did you a seriously huge favor.", "YTA. While the man didn't handle this situation in a very good way you certainly shouldn't have left a 7 year old girl alone in a car. That's too young to be left alone like that. Anything could happen in 15 minutes.", "YTA you make her butt get out the car and behave while you take care of business real quick.  She was heads down in a cell phone!!!! We\u2019re supposed to be teaching our children to stay aware and alert not be nose down in a phone with no supervision.", "YTA. So much could have gone wrong here. Don\u2019t do it again.", "ESH \n\nShould you leave your kid in the car unattended? No. Did this guy completely overreact? Yes. Your kid seems too be smart about something like this but the truth still is that it takes a second too smash a car window and snatch a kid.", "YTA. I\u2019m glad your daughter is okay, but what if the next strange man approaching the car wasn\u2019t concerned for her safety? It only takes a moment for a bad person to do a bad thing. It\u2019s your responsibility as a parent to minimize the risk of that happening. Don\u2019t leave your child alone in a vehicle while you run your errands.", "NTA. Based on the negative experience for you and your daughter, a situation like that won't happen again.\n\nWhat an AH thing of the guy to do, after seeing how upset your daughter was and for him positioning himself so you couldn't remove yourself and your kid from the situation. I dont understand what would make someone think they're being a good person doing that.", "You left a 7-yo in a running vehicle? Maybe NTA, but definitely not smart. People have been known to steal cars with kids in them. I think ESH.", "YTA why would you leave a young child alone in a car. In most places that\u2019s illegal. His approach wasn\u2019t the greatest but he had good intentions. I\u2019m surprised the cops just let you go with a warning", "I'm guessing you won't do it again.\n\nYTA", "YTA because DUH you didn\u2019t think there was a possibility of anyone (well intentioned or not) coming near the car/open window. \n\nIf it was a check cashing place like an Amscot than a double YTA cause those places are sketchy. \n\nDo better please!", "YTA. So basically you set it up so all someone had to do was bust a window and then they had access to your kid and a car that was already running? Just because nothing bad happened doesn't mean something bad can't happen. I've seen multiple news stories of people driving off with other peoples cars, with a child inside. Don't set that situation up.", "OMG....really? \n\nDid you not hear about the crazy woman in Columbus, Ohio who stole a running car with twin babies inside a few days before Christmas? Do you think a locked door and a \"smart\" 7 year old can stop a criminal with a gun from stealing the car with her in it? You don't think a kid can put a car in gear? Why do you think the police are always begging people not to leave cars running with the keys in them? \n\nYou're lucky you weren't arrested for child endangerment.  You could lose custody of your child over this kind of stuff. Stop letting a 7 year old bully you into making bad decisions. Get a handle on this or she will be totally out of control in a few years. We all have to do stuff we don't like and the sooner she learns the better.\n\nYTA. Grow up!", "YTA you don't leave kids alone in cars. \n\nIn some parts of the country it\u2019s illegal to leave your child alone in a parked car, while in other areas, proposed laws against the practice are in the works.

She could easily get snatched up in 1. \n\nYTA", "You left a 7 year old ALONE in the car? For real??Seriously??", "Maybe NTA but definitely not a safe decision.

You should be GRATEFUL that this was the man who approached your child and not someone trying to harm her", "NTA. You know your child and what she\u2019s capable of. 7 is old enough for a mature kiddo. He\u2019s so out of line", "NTA. Your kid was fine and the man was acting very uncivil and your daughter should not have been treated that way by him, but only ever do that if they have numbers or if they're old enough on their own. Exert more caution, and make a safer decision.", "YTA - you left a 7 year old alone in a running car?  You're damned lucky the cops let you off.  It was irresponsible as hell, both from stranger-danger and from the kid accidentally putting it in gear.", "I\u2019m not going to YTA but honestly in today\u2019s times, it is dangerous to leave a child in a car like that.  It\u2019s not like when you were growing up. For Gods sakes people break into cars and steal dogs!  You left the car running, an invitation for someone to break a window and take off.  I\u2019m guessing you live in a safe area where things like that don\u2019t happen. It only takes once.  And that man should have immediately walked away when he realized he was scaring your daughter. He didn\u2019t care about her he just wanted to puff his ego.", "ESH.

Your daughter is smart. She had a phone she could use if there was an emergency. The car was cool. She was fine.  \n\nBut, that man didn\u2019t care that she was fine. He could tell that she was. He could tell that his presence was the main threat to her. But, he saw an opportunity to bully her and to bully you and he took it, to the fullest extent he could. He called the cops not because he saw an emergency, but because he wanted to punish you and punish your child. And, *that* is the threat you opened her to. \n\nYour daughter is far, far less likely to get kidnapped than she was when we were kids, but she\u2019s far more likely to get into negative interactions with the police (or see you in those situations).

Second is that you were gone for 15 freaking minutes, do you know how far someone could get with her, how they could have switch cars or shit could have just gone ahead and had their damn way with your child, the child you are supposed to protect!

In these cultures everyone looks out for each other\u2026 the most vulnerable generally (children, elderly, etc). This builds into the community- the sense that everyone is working together. Kids are safe, the community is safe (and feels safe) because everyone is looking out for children, all the children, not just their own. \n\nThe problem here is the culture, the way the framework of individualism has created a toxic legal framework of everyone for themselves cause some one (individual) must be solely responsible when bad shit happens. Good Samaritan laws have to be passed so people aren\u2019t held accountable (financially or legally/criminally) for trying to help. \n\nRaising children takes a village. It\u2019s not a metaphor, it\u2019s the truth. But not in America, everyone has to be everything at all times, don\u2019t ask for help, don\u2019t expect help not my problem/responsibility etc. And it turns into this\u2026 victim blaming. And who is usually at fault? People set up to fail- the poor (often single) working class parent (often mother) just making ends meet. \n\nA study was published pretty much about this issue. Children in a parked car are SAFER than a moving car. Period. No other context needed. Sure, something bad could happen.

But, a very small number of children die in a parked car\u2026 that\u2019s novel (as in unusual, not common, we haven\u2019t become numb to it)\u2026 it makes the news.

But, we can easily say, \u201cnot me, I wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d\u2026 because it\u2019s easy to judge this\u2026 but car accidents and gun deaths are the \u201cprice of freedom\u201d and unavoidable. \n\nActual crime rates, and the incidents of violence are at historic lows! But, you wouldn\u2019t know it from the news, and forums like this. Perceptions aren\u2019t shaped by facts, but mostly by feelings. And Americans are afraid. They\u2019re feeling vulnerable, disconnected, uncertain about the future. And, being able to point fingers, and judge others is shelter from these feelings and fears. They consume a diet of dire warnings and cautionary tales that keep them isolated, looking at people like they\u2019re potential criminals rather than members of a community.

Most of our neighbors have our numbers so we have never been sure who called the police instead of calling us, but we think it might have been a doordash or other delivery driver who called, because we had noticed a car sitting for a strangely long time about 20 minutes before that.", "Yeah, my brother backed out of our driveway when he was like 4. Nothing happened, but it could have been bad if there'd been traffic.", "Today my 4yo and I were shopping and we needed a quick trip to the ladies. She went first then waited by the sink for my turn. While I was in the stall I could hear another lady come into the room. Lady obviously saw a child seemingly unattended and asked \u201cHi honey, do you need any help?\u201d. My kid replied clearly that she already went, just waiting for mummy. Lady left her alone. I bet if that man had approached your daughter in a similar way she would\u2019ve been able to tell him she was fine. What she got instead was probably \u201cWHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN A CAR ALONE?!\u201d", "I don\u2019t see the problem. She\u2019s not an infant or a toddler and you raised your kid so you know what she can handle. My mom used to leave me in the car around 10 to run inside quickly to grab stuff at the grocery and come back. I get why people are fearful but anything can happen to you or your kid anywhere. \n\nThe one thing that I would say is a little scary is that human trafficking has picked up in my home town and while I would\u2019ve left a 7 year old for 10 minutes while I ran into Publix a few years ago, I doubt I\u2019d do so today. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole but was if the smartest thing? No. I mean you know by now. But that stranger sucked. Some people have nothing going on in their lives they need to police others", "True. Still not leaving a 7 year old alone in the car.", "It wasn't a trip. I saw it multiple times over the 4 months i was there. Kids left their homes and got on a train then got off the train a couple stops later. It was a group of ten or so kids from the neighborhood. The teacher I thought I saw wasn't traveling with them, but was on the platform where all the kids got off.", "> I think the point is if you have your kid with you when something happens then whoever helps you or sees things happening can also then help/mind the child.\n\nImagine if cigarette companies started claiming that cigarettes save lives because a person could theoretically stop for cigarettes on their way to work which could potentially prevent them from being in the towers on 9/11. That's the level of insane logic your using.", "But it isn't just kidnapping it is crazy people and scary situations like the one this kid went through alone because their mom left them alone", "I also can\u2019t understand why he took the father to jail over it, he admits there was no danger. Sounds like he was power tripping.", "NTA. That guy was looking for any situation in which he could be a hero. It would be fine if he went up to he car just to make sure that the climate control was on and then left. But he wanted to make a big scene so everyone could get a look at the big hero. \n\nSelf-defense classes are a great idea. It may have been a good idea to alert store employees to tell the man to leave the premises and stop blocking your car. If he refused, he could be arrested for trespassing.", "I sometimes leave my 8 year old in the car while I walk into the bank or gas station, but I personally wouldn\u2019t consider it for a big supermarket where I couldn\u2019t peek out the window periodically to see my kid. \n\nMy car got stolen out of my own driveway once so I can\u2019t even base a judgement on that possibility. I live in a nice neighborhood too. \n\nMy 13 year old has a cell phone now so if I have to, I leave my 8 and 13 year old together in the car, and video chat them if it\u2019s taking a long time. \n\nNTA", "NTA you took all the precautionary actions needed for a 7 year old it isn't like they were a newborn.  That guy is just an AH who loves sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.", "YTA. You should never leave your child in the car alone. Period. It doesn't matter how \"safe\" the neighborhood is. Just because our parents used to do it doesn't mean it's right. My dad used to lay me down in the front seat of his car when I was an infant.  I survived but my kids are all in the appropriate car seats, facing the appropriate way.", "I used to sit in the car ALL the time as a kid (basically once I was old enough to know how to lock/unlock the car door) cause I didn't want to go in Menards or Farm n' Fleet and spends 2+ hours there. So I'd stay in the car with my book and read until my parents came back, no one ever tried to pull this crap (which I would probably find just as traumatizing as OP's kid did). Maybe it's not \"acceptable\" anymore but this guy was WAY out of line.", "NTA, i used to get left in the car all the time. If that man was actually worried he could\u2019ve stood by from a distance or sat in his car and watched to see how long/ if she was okay in the car.", "Just because it\u2019s not illegal doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay. If you can\u2019t take your child in for a quick fifteen minutes go home and do it later. Leaving the car on with a child inside is a whole other level of dangerous.", "Kids shouldn't be the ones making the decisions when it involves safety.  And bad stuff CAN happen when you leave a kid alone in a car.  \n\nGentle YTA to you, OP,  because you let your kid make a decision that COULD have had awful consequences.", "We just had twin babies taken in a running car while the mom ran in to get her food order in our state.  One baby was found right away and it took a while for the second to be found.  Thank God they were both found and safe.  A woman took the car with the children in it.  It only takes a moment.

It all changed with the internet.  \n\nPeople forget, there were child predators years ago, just that we didn't much know about them.  We didn't have 24 hour news, we didn't have social media, etc.  We had the evening news, and that was about all. \n\nHad it been super hot, had it been a long time?  That would have been different.  But on a cool day, when the child has climate control?  OK.", "NTA. Honestly feel this is all part of victim blaming culture and individualism. As towns and cities become less community oriented and more every man for themselves, this breeds distrust. Stranger danger. Instead of \"why does that mother leave her child in the car alone for 15 minutes?\" we should ask why sick f..ers who hurt kids aren't all locked up for life. Just as we shouldn't ask why a girl dares dress in a miniskirt, but rather why certain men take that as an invitation.", "NTA. People need to mind their own business. If he had concerns about it he could have stood by from afar and waited for you to return then carried on his day. But to approach a child and scare her and create a scene is uncalled for.", "As a former Kroger employee, if I would have seen that while connecting carts, I would have had my manager call the cops. No way am I being blamed for something that happened in the store parking lot because you couldn\u2019t take the extra minute to take your child inside. Your parent may have left you in the car, but in 2023, you don\u2019t do that. \n\nYTA.", "NTA. i truly don\u2019t care if i get downvoted to hell. i think it is absolutely ridiculous all the expectations that are placed on parents now. i\u2019m nowhere close to boomer age (24/elder gen z) & i remember my mom leaving me in the car while she ran into a gas station or grocery store. did i die? no. i was perfectly fine. & like your child, the ONLY time i got frightened was when a strange man came up to the car. he is 100% the AH", "INFO: why didnt you just go through the drive through at the bank?", "All the people posting here normalising leaving children in a running car are morons. There is no other explanation. Kids are curious, ape their parents. I was left in a manual transmission jeep when I was a kid. It was off with keys in the ignition and the vehicle in gear. I turned the key and almost ran over my grandfather. There is a reason that laws exist to never leave kids in cars with keys or the engine running. You\u2019re such a major asshole that CPS should be called on you and the Stranger berating you is quite possibly a really good person. Idiot!!", "NTA-My parents left me in the car at that age, probably younger because i would rather read that age than follow my dad around the hardware store or whatever, and crime rates were much higher back then, I survived just fine.", "NTA... I think you have the ability to make that decision based on the maturity of your child, the area that you live in and the laws of the land. Your opinion may have changed because of this experience but that's fine too. \nAnd yes, I was raised with MUCH more freedom and experience then a 7yr old would have now. Because of this, I moved out at 18 to start my life, and it wasnt to escape a bad situation, I was ready at that age.", "YTA. You may think it is a safe location and that your state says it is not illegal.  But where are your ethics?  \nChildren DO get assaulted.  They do get taken. Thieves DO steal cars.

Just because it hasn\u2019t happened to you yet doesn\u2019t meant it WON\u2019T.  \n\nThe fact there was a guy there for that time talking to your kid ?

What could have happened?", "At the age of 1 years old my dad left me in the car at the gas station to run in to pay for gas. He was in there for 2 minutes.

I see the littlest kids climbing off the city buses in the Bay Area and walking to school. Maybe relatedly, the most confident people I ever see are teen girls walking in SF and Oakland.

Which is not to say they *should* have had to come up like that, but my 40 year old sheltered self is in awe", "I agree with you, and I do have kids. In addition to location, it totally depends on the kid. It's kinda the same as leaving a kid home alone. My oldest when he was 7-sure. He could be depended on to just chill in the car, knew not to talk to people, keep doors locked, etc. Knew how to use the phone in case something bad happened. Knew not to mess with the vehicle controls, as well as how to get out of the car if it was on fire or something. My youngest, now 7-hell no. He's a little madman, and I would not trust him to not decide to try and drive the car, lol. That being said, I do leave him under older son's supervision (now 13) in the car when I need to go run in somewhere real quick.\n\nI think this is NTA. I understand people being concerned with hot cars, etc-but a 7yo isn't a helpless baby, and eventually, you have to allow kids a tiny taste of growing up and it should happen in gradual, shorter spans like this.", "I mean, I don\u2019t want to sound all boomer, but in my day, circa 1988-1992\u2026.

The school even had rules that you weren't allowed to ride your bike to school instead of walking until 3rd grade (8-9 years old) since they felt that was less safe than walking.

For me in the 80s this wasn\u2019t an option, my parents had no idea where I was all day, but knew I would come home when I was hungry.
