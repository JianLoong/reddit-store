My parents used to leave me in the car allllllll the time and I figured I'd be in the no more than 10 minutes so I conceded. I left the car on, she had climate control, a cracked window, left her my phone to play games on, and we went over the protocol (she locked the doors after I left and was only supposed to unlock them when I came back to the car) She's a smart kid and knows stranger danger protocol too. There was a short line at the check cashing counter but I was in the store for no more than 15 minutes. When I came out of the store I could hear my daughter crying and screaming so of course I went running ready to murder someone for trying to steal my child. Instead I found her safe in the car but a man standing by the window trying to talk to her. As soon as they saw me she starts screaming for me and he looks angry and starts screamingat me too. He's yelling at me for leaving my child in the car. I tell him that she was perfectly fine and in no risk of overheating considering its winter and the car was on. He continues to berate me and called me a bad mother for leaving her in the car. Meanwhile my daughter has unlocked the door and climbed into my arms. I ask her what happened while I was in the store and she tells me that she was just playing her game on my phone when \"a scary stranger approached me, scared me, and started asking me about my parents. I was scared so I started crying.\" He's still yelling at me and making a huge scene so then an employee gets involved and tells the man he should have minded his own business. Apparently she had been doing cart return and witnessed the whole thing. She had seen that my daughter was fine until the man approached her. So then I start yelling back at the man telling him that HE scared my daughter and he should be ashamed of himself for causing such distress to my child. I get ready to leave because I have had enough of the whole situation and it was getting close to dinner time so I had more important things to do like feed my child (and calm her down). At that point he tells me that he's called the cops and he's going to stand behind my car until they got there so that we couldn't leave. I tried to get him to leave, but he wouldn't budge and when the cops arrived they took statements from everyone. All I got was a talking to and a warning but some of his words really got to me.\n\nEdit: I just want to throw in here that we were at a very crowded Kroger grocery in a VERY safe neighborhood. And it's NOT ILLEGAL in my state. Also, if I thought my kid was even the slightest bit immature enough to mess with my car, I wouldn't have considered it but I thought she has been taught enough to know not to mess with the car. She plays with the radio and the climate control, that's it. Also we both learned from the situation. I know that no matter the situation, I'll be dragging her into wherever I am going. And she has also said that she learned from the situation and will never try to get me to let her stay in the car again. She also asked if she could take self-defense classes which I thought was incredibly mature of her. So now I'm looking into mommy & me self defense classes (no that doesn't exist, but I'm trying to find somewhere that has a class we can both take.)\n\nEdit 2: I'm sorry this post seems to be triggering some people so badly.

In the moment it seems like a harmless decision. I was left in the car too, when I was a kid. It\u2019s so tough, sometimes. \n\nI think of it this way. There is a jar on the table with 10,000 jellybeans. One of them is poison. The odds are beyond excellent that if you eat one, you\u2019re fine. But the permanent fallout of the one poison candy outweighs that 9999/10000. It\u2019s like that with leaving a kid in the car. You\u2019ll come back to her 9999/10000 times. But that 1/10000? Imagine how your stomach drops. Imagine how you can\u2019t even speak, can\u2019t even breathe. Imagine how your mind screams \u201cnononononoNONONONONONOOOOOOOOOO!!!\u201d \n\nImagine what happens next. \n\nDrag the kid into the bank. Ten minutes of attitude is worth it. \n\nThe gentlest YTA to you.", "I have no idea if YTA but I'll say my piece.  \n\nI'm almost 40.  I, with my brother, or alone, were left in the car 100 times when someone ran into the convenience store or similar.  It was what was done in the 80's. \n\nAnd in comparison, the 80's had significantly higher crime.  People are saying look up horror stories online.  We didn't have online horror stories back then so who knows. \n\nChild rearing, and children today seem a lot different.  I don't have kids.  I don't know if I understand what's happened with raising children.  I'm not trying to be a boomer and say \"WE USED TO DO IT THIS WAY\".  It just seems they're raised a lot differently and a lot more protectively now.    It seems like suburban kids don't even have friends outside of school anymore half the time.  They come home and they're home.  Not riding bikes all over the world in roving packs getting into horseplay. \n\nI also don't have a lot of friends with kids or discuss parenting with the ones I do because I don't have kids.  If I were to have a kid today, who knows what society would think about my notions of how to raise one. \n\nBut most of all, I have no idea where you live and the area you did this in.  I live in a rural area with not a lot going on these days.  When I was a kid, I lived in one of the most populated non-city areas in the country.  \n\nI don't think anyone would bat an eye out here.  I've probably seen it at the local mart or the feed store 100 times and didn't even register it as odd.  \n\nAnd if I did, and I started hounding the kid or berating the parent, I'd probably get a good smack in the mouth for it.", "Personally I think it depends on the child and how they were raised if one is to leave them alone for a few minutes. In your case NTA. Your kid understood what to do and handled it appropriately. A lot of people will say YTA and only see a kids age and say \"You shouldn't leave a child alone!\". So when is it viable to do so? 8? 11? A person's age doesn't equate to maturity or common sense.", "NTA.\n\nThe people freaking out about stranger danger and the perceived risks of leaving your child alone in a car while you go into a store have been watching too many cable news programs.\n\nThe [law in California](https://www.costamesaca.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=703) only prohibits leaving children age 6 or younger in cars unattended A) if the car is running or B) if conditions (like heat or cold) make pose a significant danger to the child's health or safety.\n\nI can't speak for other states, but leaving a 7 year-old alone in a car is perfectly legal in California. That's because stranger abduction is incredibly rare. And, when it happens, it's almost always on the way to or from school, not from a locked car outside of a store.\n\nAfter the man scared the crap of your child, he should have moved away and left her alone. By blocking you from leaving, he may have thought of himself as effecting a citizen's arrest, but unlawful imprisonment is a closer fit. He is the AH here, not you.", "I just read over on r/legal of a similar situation in NJ. Little girl was 5 yrs old. Mom ran into Costco for 30 minutes. Police were called. Child was taken to ER to be checked. CPS was called in and mom might be looking at criminal charges. You\u2019re NTA but you need to count yourself lucky you aren\u2019t in serious trouble with the law and that that man wasn\u2019t some pervert who could have gotten to your child. Learn a very valuable life lesson. Take responsibility for your poor decision rather than blame the man for blocking your exit. He may have been out of line yelling at you and upsetting your child but he wasn\u2019t the irresponsible adult in this situation. You were. Own it!", "In these circumstances he\u2019s definitely the overstepping nosey AH that needs to mind his buisness and not be a creeper that\u2019s peering into peoples windows. Unfortunately the world is a messed up place with lots of bad people and anything can happen, so it\u2019s probably for the best that you\u2019ve decided to just drag her along from now on. That being said, my kids are 5 and 2 and it\u2019s super tempting to leave them in the car when I have a <5 minute errand to run and I don\u2019t want to wrangle 2 kids out and back in to their car seats (I don\u2019t actually do it, I just sometimes wish I could) so I totally get where you\u2019re coming from.", "NTA. If you haven\u2019t read anything by Lenore Skenazy of Free Range Parenting yet, I recommend it. You\u2019ll feel more secure in your decision.", "Jesus Christ. People suck these days. Kids used to literally walk miles to the store to pick up groceries or go to school at 7 years old. Yes you can leave your kid in the car for a few minutes, especially when they are at an age where they are capable of finding you, getting out of the car themselves etc. \n\nFFS. Soon we're going to have to have babysitters for 17 year olds. \ud83d\ude44 NTA.", "My issue would be that check cashing places aren't generally the safest areas, you know? But maybe now your kid will be too scared to stay in the car in the future.", "[deleted]", "Go look up some horror stories online you\u2019ll figure out why YTA", "Hate to break it to you, but YTA here.\n\nSure, you thought it was safe to leave your kid in the car running, but glass can break, and someone could have taken the car AND your child.  The guy was doing what he thought was right--I would have not spoken to your daughter, but called the police, but still.  You don't leave your child in a car for any reason under any circumstances.", "YTA for so many reasons. Being a parent means making your kid follow directions at times, even when they don\u2019t want to. Leaving them in a car alone is not the right answer. Someone could have broken a window and kidnapped your child and/or stolen your vehicle. Your daughter could have played around in the car and shifted the gears and caused an accident.", "I'm going to say ESH. I understand having an intelligent child but you learned today that despite her maturity and understanding of things you two have talked about, being in the moment is miles different than coming up with safety scenarios. Her response was to panic. If this had been a real situation, a real emergency, that panic very well could have gotten her hurt, or stolen. She is not ready to be alone in a car for that long. You mistook her intelligence for preparedness. It happens, people aren't perfect.\n\nAside from that, you're also the AH for escalating the situation. If she climbed out of the car crying her eyes out and clinging to you, going off on the stranger didn't help. You made a stressful situation more stressful. Yelling at him had no positive outcome here, except maybe to make you feel better for a few seconds. \n\nHe's the AH because while he was a concerned citizen, he didn't have to approach the situation like that at all. Who approaches a child alone in a car and interrogates them? If he thought she shouldn't be alone he could have just called the police to begin with and made a report, and then watched from a distance so as not to terrify your kid. \n\nI'm so sorry she had to go through all of this. Adults made mistakes at every turn with her today.", "YTA - 1000% you are.  An ill-intentioned person could have shattered the vehicle window and your daughter could have vanished in less than 30 seconds.  I cannot believe anyone would be foolish enough to do something like that in this day and age.  He was totally an AH as to how he went about it, but if he scared you into sense, then that man did you a seriously huge favor.", "YTA. While the man didn't handle this situation in a very good way you certainly shouldn't have left a 7 year old girl alone in a car. That's too young to be left alone like that. Anything could happen in 15 minutes.", "YTA you make her butt get out the car and behave while you take care of business real quick.  She was heads down in a cell phone!!!! We\u2019re supposed to be teaching our children to stay aware and alert not be nose down in a phone with no supervision.", "YTA. So much could have gone wrong here. Don\u2019t do it again.", "ESH \n\nShould you leave your kid in the car unattended? No. Did this guy completely overreact? Yes. Your kid seems too be smart about something like this but the truth still is that it takes a second too smash a car window and snatch a kid.", "YTA. I\u2019m glad your daughter is okay, but what if the next strange man approaching the car wasn\u2019t concerned for her safety? It only takes a moment for a bad person to do a bad thing. It\u2019s your responsibility as a parent to minimize the risk of that happening. Don\u2019t leave your child alone in a vehicle while you run your errands.", "NTA. Based on the negative experience for you and your daughter, a situation like that won't happen again.\n\nWhat an AH thing of the guy to do, after seeing how upset your daughter was and for him positioning himself so you couldn't remove yourself and your kid from the situation. I dont understand what would make someone think they're being a good person doing that.", "You left a 7-yo in a running vehicle? Maybe NTA, but definitely not smart. People have been known to steal cars with kids in them. I think ESH.", "YTA why would you leave a young child alone in a car. In most places that\u2019s illegal. His approach wasn\u2019t the greatest but he had good intentions. I\u2019m surprised the cops just let you go with a warning", "I'm guessing you won't do it again.\n\nYTA", "YTA because DUH you didn\u2019t think there was a possibility of anyone (well intentioned or not) coming near the car/open window. \n\nIf it was a check cashing place like an Amscot than a double YTA cause those places are sketchy. \n\nDo better please!", "YTA. So basically you set it up so all someone had to do was bust a window and then they had access to your kid and a car that was already running? Just because nothing bad happened doesn't mean something bad can't happen. I've seen multiple news stories of people driving off with other peoples cars, with a child inside. Don't set that situation up.", "OMG....really? \n\nDid you not hear about the crazy woman in Columbus, Ohio who stole a running car with twin babies inside a few days before Christmas? Do you think a locked door and a \"smart\" 7 year old can stop a criminal with a gun from stealing the car with her in it? You don't think a kid can put a car in gear? Why do you think the police are always begging people not to leave cars running with the keys in them? \n\nYou're lucky you weren't arrested for child endangerment.  You could lose custody of your child over this kind of stuff. Stop letting a 7 year old bully you into making bad decisions. Get a handle on this or she will be totally out of control in a few years. We all have to do stuff we don't like and the sooner she learns the better.\n\nYTA. Grow up!", "YTA you don't leave kids alone in cars. \n\nIn some parts of the country it\u2019s illegal to leave your child alone in a parked car, while in other areas, proposed laws against the practice are in the works.

You should be GRATEFUL that this was the man who approached your child and not someone trying to harm her", "NTA.

Your kid was fine and the man was acting very uncivil and your daughter should not have been treated that way by him, but only ever do that if they have numbers or if they're old enough on their own. Exert more caution, and make a safer decision.", "YTA - you left a 7 year old alone in a running car?  You're damned lucky the cops let you off.  It was irresponsible as hell, both from stranger-danger and from the kid accidentally putting it in gear.", "I\u2019m not going to YTA but honestly in today\u2019s times, it is dangerous to leave a child in a car like that.  It\u2019s not like when you were growing up. For Gods sakes people break into cars and steal dogs!  You left the car running, an invitation for someone to break a window and take off.  I\u2019m guessing you live in a safe area where things like that don\u2019t happen. It only takes once.  And that man should have immediately walked away when he realized he was scaring your daughter. He didn\u2019t care about her he just wanted to puff his ego.", "ESH.

Your daughter is smart. She had a phone she could use if there was an emergency. The car was cool. She was fine.  \n\nBut, that man didn\u2019t care that she was fine. He could tell that she was. He could tell that his presence was the main threat to her. But, he saw an opportunity to bully her and to bully you and he took it, to the fullest extent he could. He called the cops not because he saw an emergency, but because he wanted to punish you and punish your child. And, *that* is the threat you opened her to. \n\nYour daughter is far, far less likely to get kidnapped than she was when we were kids, but she\u2019s far more likely to get into negative interactions with the police (or see you in those situations).

Second is that you were gone for 15 freaking minutes, do you know how far someone could get with her, how they could have switch cars or shit could have just gone ahead and had their damn way with your child, the child you are supposed to protect!

In these cultures everyone looks out for each other\u2026 the most vulnerable generally (children, elderly, etc). This builds into the community- the sense that everyone is working together. Kids are safe, the community is safe (and feels safe) because everyone is looking out for children, all the children, not just their own. \n\nThe problem here is the culture, the way the framework of individualism has created a toxic legal framework of everyone for themselves cause some one (individual) must be solely responsible when bad shit happens. Good Samaritan laws have to be passed so people aren\u2019t held accountable (financially or legally/criminally) for trying to help. \n\nRaising children takes a village. It\u2019s not a metaphor, it\u2019s the truth. But not in America, everyone has to be everything at all times, don\u2019t ask for help, don\u2019t expect help not my problem/responsibility etc. And it turns into this\u2026 victim blaming. And who is usually at fault? People set up to fail- the poor (often single) working class parent (often mother) just making ends meet. \n\nA study was published pretty much about this issue. Children in a parked car are SAFER than a moving car. Period. No other context needed. Sure, something bad could happen.

But, a very small number of children die in a parked car\u2026 that\u2019s novel (as in unusual, not common, we haven\u2019t become numb to it)\u2026 it makes the news.

But, we can easily say, \u201cnot me, I wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d\u2026 because it\u2019s easy to judge this\u2026 but car accidents and gun deaths are the \u201cprice of freedom\u201d and unavoidable. \n\nActual crime rates, and the incidents of violence are at historic lows! But, you wouldn\u2019t know it from the news, and forums like this. Perceptions aren\u2019t shaped by facts, but mostly by feelings. And Americans are afraid. They\u2019re feeling vulnerable, disconnected, uncertain about the future. And, being able to point fingers, and judge others is shelter from these feelings and fears. They consume a diet of dire warnings and cautionary tales that keep them isolated, looking at people like they\u2019re potential criminals rather than members of a community.

And I think in most situations, a man is going to scare someone more than a woman \\[not saying it's impossible, just saying most stranger danger things kids are shown use men, even the modern ones.\\] so a strange man approaching a kid and asking her personal questions \\[like stranger-danger stuff shows them to do\\] would freak a kid out. And even if he WAS trying to help, he pretty much made the situation worse for the kid. Like, what if she DID need help and he scared her like that?", "NTA. There is a reason that so many Americans behave like children - they have been over-supervised and never really grow up. Everyone has to feel \"safe\". I was going to the store at 5 and walking to school by the age of 7. This was considered perfectly normal in my culture at that time. The current hysteria where cops and CPS get involved over every little perceived risk is why so many people are paranoid.", "More to the point, if you\u2019re comfortable leaving your child alone for that long without knowing their completely safe then you probably needed that reality check.", "Nta this confirmed that I will drag my kid with me inside. But I was a kid that liked staying in the car I used to ignore ppl when they would be annoying. As an adult I still like staying in the car lol", "While I do not think YTA, I implore you to stick to your word and never leave her in the car alone again (or even with other children). I am a first responder, and some of the calls I\u2019ve worked started with situations 100% like yours and ended in tragedy, and by your post I know you\u2019re a good parent who would never EVER want your family in that position. So please, just trust me when I say your child could be the most mature person on the planet, and evil people can still do their thing.", "YTA. You are asking for someone to try and steal either the car or the kid. Until the kid is big enough to put up a decent fight they shouldn\u2019t be left alone in public spaces.", "Well something bad happened when you left her in the car alone so...make of that what you will. Both AH?", "YTA\n\nChildren are not like pets that you can just leave in a car unattended.\n\nYou were gone for fifteen minutes? Even a minute is indefensible. The perception to the person who saw your daughter in the car by herself was that she *had* been alone for some time. If I saw a child alone in a running car and/or playing with the radio and climate control like you mentioned in the edit (LOL, you clearly do this often), I would certainly alert anyone nearby or call the police. You can't expect that total strangers are going to cut you slack for \"being really quick!\" \n\nAlso, the police officer telling you that you shouldn't leave your child unattended isn't making things up. You're lucky that you were let off with a warning, although it comes off like you would do this again anyway.", "I also grew up in a rural area in the 80\u2019s and my mom once left my sister and a neighbor kid in the car while she ran in to pick me up at preschool. My sister hopped out of her car seat and put the car in gear and it started rolling toward a busy highway. My mom had to chase the car and put it back in park and then I\u2019d imagine she had a minor heart attack. Shot happens. Cars are dangerous machinery. Kids shouldn\u2019t be left in a running car.", "She's handling it better than I am tbh. I'm beating myself up for my mistakes whereas she has learned from it, chosen how she will move forward, and seems fine. I have actually been really proud of her. My best friend says I need to give myself more forgiveness and understanding.", "For perspective, she also could have taken the child into the store and lost her to that one jellybean who turns out to be an active shooter. Talk about permanent fallout.\n\nNo choice is 100% safe. \n\nAnyway, trusting a child with small and increasing amounts of independence is a judgment call and totally different from parent to parent, child to child, situation to situation... \n\nUnderstand that this parent had their child's safety in mind and was the one  in the position to make this call. And she made the same decision that your parents made.", "Sorry but I disagree otherwise we wouldn't go out at all there is risk in everything.", "Thanks! I'll keep looking then.", "Nonsense, I live in CA and children over 6 years can be in cars.", "I remember being in the car and my mom said she would just be 10min, that turned into 20 and then I started to get worried but I'm not allowed to leave the car. So then it's like what should i do? I know what to do for strangers, but not if my mom didn't come back. Wtf. She came back later obvs but that stressed me the fuck out as a kid in a car by myself.", "Crime is overall lower now than it was in the 80s. Stranger abduction was rare then, as it is now.", "I honestly 100% agree with your points.", "Yeah, I mean if it were just the car itself and the weather conditions to worry about, I don\u2019t think at her age it\u2019s any more dangerous than driving around with your kid in the car (which is the most dangerous thing most people do with their kids daily). Although I would be a little worried about leaving the car/heater running due to potential for carbon monoxide. But attitudes have changed so much, and I think it\u2019s largely for the the good. But I would NOT trust someone to not call the cops or smash my windows or something. I don\u2019t even leave my dogs in the car anymore after getting a nasty note when I left my GSD for fifteen minutes on a forty degree day in full shade with windows cracked. There is definitely nuance to leaving kids, especially older kids, in the car but there are enough people who lack nuance it\u2019s just not worth it any more.", "My brother did this when he was two! Not into a busy highway though. He hit the side of a barn and was basically just rolling forward, so he was fine. But, that was almost 40 years ago. This is how we ended up with so many of the safety features on modern cars. I think you have to be mashing the brake to engage the transmission now.", "Literally last Wednesday where I live there was a story about a man who left his young son in his car for a very very quick trip into a shop.\n\nDuring that very quick trip the car was stolen.\n\nThe thief realised quick enough that there was a kid in the car, pulled over, dumped him on the footpath and bailed. Kid was ok in the end but obviously that could have gone wrong a million different ways.\n\nStrangers abducting children may be very rare but car theft is common enough.", "You made a judgement call. It was a judgement call that is currently not socially acceptable but it was not, aside from that, necessarily a bad one. Your kid is fine. You are fine. It was upsetting but no permanent harm done. And the fact that you are still worried about shows that you are a good and thoughtful mom!", "Honestly - stop beating yourself up, you really did not do anything wrong at all.\n\nGiving kids some autonomy and doing smaller things by themselves - like waiting alone in the car for you for a few minutes, maybe a little later walking to a friend by themselves, etc - is so important and so rewarding and beneficial for them.\n\nThe current streak of helicopter parenting is a nightmare, has extremely negative psychological implications for those kids in the long run (huge increases in anxiety disorders in kids; less confidence in themselves; less \u201cstreets smarts\u201d in kids and the ability to problem solve; much too big dependence on their caregivers to solve problems for them), and that leads to things like parents making \u201cparent appointments\u201d to talk to the university professors of their 18/19 years olds.", "Sure. But leaving my kid in a car elevates the risk higher than I\u2019m comfortable with. So I bring him in the store with me, even when it\u2019s harder. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not eating a jellybean from that jar.", "The nicer areas are the best place to find nicer cars to steal and so convenient if they have the keys in them and are running. A lot of horrible things can happen in 15 minutes and you would probably be surprised at how many of those nice strangers will just look the other way and mind their own business.", "Sorry, I meant parents blas\u00e9 attitude of parenting in the 80\u2019s, not the actual crime. I\u2019ve seen more stories in the last 20 years of my life of accidental kidnapping during car thefts than I did in the first 20+.", "What if you took your child with you and then had a heart attack while holding their hand, or you both get hit by the bus. Everyone can play that game to push an opinion..", "Yes, that's made a difference over the years for sure.\n\nBut then I remember my daughter joyously jumping on the brake pedal when she was small...", "Yup, best to ignore the lesser probabilities, right?  Bet you don't play the lottery or pay for insurance, right?", "Fair enough", "Life itself is you eating a jellybean from that jar. You can\u2019t even send your child to school if you want to avoid the poisonous jelly bean 100% (school shooters).", "You\u2019re probably eating handfuls of those jellybeans every day lol\n\nNo situation is 100% safe.", "He unnecessarily scared her child - he absolutely is to blame. Her child was in a safe space and he compromised that.", "I never even let my kid leave the house, and I would NEVER bring them somewhere in a car - that just seems insane to me, do you have any idea how common car accidents are?", "There are risks you take to achieve a worthwhile goal and then there are risks taken for no real gain.", "Thanks. I have reinforced that she did nothing wrong. And have even tried to tell her that it was MY responsibility to bring her with me and not cave to her demands but as I said before she is incredibly mature (somehow) so she keeps insisting that she shouldn't have fought me about going in. But you are right, it's important to teach her as much as possible about what can happen, why, and how to react but in an appropriate way. I will admit I've been guilty of oversharing parenting when trying to explain things to her. I'm a big believer in explaining as much as possible so that they can make the most informed decisions but sometimes that gives kids too much credit and information.", "You are saying a fifth grader can't be left alone for a few minutes? Can you cite the relevant statute?  I don't live in SC but couldn't find any such SC state law on the books other than general laws against child endangerment that apply to all minors-- anyone under *18*."]}
