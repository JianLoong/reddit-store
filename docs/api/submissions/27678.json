I (F34) and my husband (M34) have been married for 8 years, together for 10. We have a happy married life with 3 b3autiful children. I have a wonderful relationship with my husbands side. However, 8 years ago before we got married, we were going through a rough patch. Certain comments made by his mother made me doubt whether this is the kind of family I want to be a part of. My then fianc\u00e9 (now husband) had told me that it was a misunderstanding and sometimes my MIL is rough around the edges and what she says doesn't mean what she meant to say and that i was taling it the wrong way. Anyways I have always told him from the beginning when we were dating that any issues we have should be between us and not to share what we go through with anyone outside our relationship. While we were going through the rough patch and I was having doubts, my husband surprised me with a bbq get together with both his and my family as a pre wedding celebration. During that event, my MIL slipped me a letter and told me that it was just between her and me. Needless to say, when I got back home that day and I read the letter, it was one of the most heartfelt letters I had read. My MIL reassured me that she would always care for me, and that mine and her son's happiness was all that she cared for. There were a few other things that honestly made me tear up. After getting that letter, mine and my MIL relationship improved significantly and any doubts I had were erased. Now fast forward 8 years, last week my FIL accidently let slip to me that my husband had told my MIL while we were going through the rough patch and of my doubts about getting married to him. My MIL has asked what she could do to make it better, and my husband had put it in to her mind to write that heartfelt letter all those years ago. Despite telling him then, not to share our personal things with others outside the relationship, my husband broke my trust and did it anyway. I have asked my husband if he did it, he admitted he did but only because he says he knew it would make me feel better and not to feel like his mother was going to make our married life difficult. I am now confused as on one hand the letter definitely improved our relationship, heck we even go on short getaways just me and my MIL, on the other hand my husband violated trust. I am now mad at him. So Reddit, AITA ?\n\nTLDR : Husband told his mother we were going through a rough patch before our wedding. She writes letter that improves our relationship.

Are you looking for reasons to be unhappy? You\u2019re upset that your husband tried to improve the relationship between you and his family? It also seems pretty wild to explicitly limit who your husband can speak to about his relationship.", "YTA here. I think what you need to realize is that asking him to blanket not share any problems outside of the relationship was both unrealistic and not helpful. You are mad at him for breaking your trust, which is a fair initial reaction, but you should also recognize you made a serious mistake by asking him to make that promise in the first place, especially when what he \"aired out\" was specific issues you had with his mother.\n\nLike, you had serious relationship difficulties because of his family, but asked him not to talk to them about those issues at all. Realistically, that meant you made him promise to never try to fix a major issue and commit to his family continuing to act in a way you dislike, which was a terrible idea. I don't know if he \"should\" have pointed that out to you instead of going behind your back, but I don't think you're going to make your life better by getting so pot committed to a very, very bad idea you had; you're basically saying \"I'm mad you didn't let our relationship self destruct and would have rather failed then than be together now in these circumstances.\"", "YTA. You're holding onto a grudge from 8 years ago? Your husband tried to mend things between you and his mother because he cared about your happiness. The letter improved your relationship, and you even have a good bond with your MIL now. Get over it and stop punishing him for something that ultimately had a positive outcome", "YTA...from what i understand the rough patch was because issues between you and his mother...so he didn't \"air\" the problem in your relationship with him...but he pointed on the problem between you and his mother", "He didn't really violate your trust 8 years ago.  The conflict was between you and his mother, he wasn't divulging difficulties in your relationship.  He went to her with the intention of repairing your relationship with his mother and making sure that you were comfortable being part of his family.\n\nYou love your husband and have three beautiful kids.\n\nYou and your MIL get along so well that you go on getaways together.\n\nYou \"told him off,\" presumably he apologized.\n\nKind of feel like you're looking for trouble here.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

To be married to someone and expect them to never speak to anyone outside your marriage is unreasonable, especially during difficult times.  Everyone needs to vent.  Sometimes others can give us insight or a different perspective into issues in a way we can't see ourselves.  It is not always healthy to vent to your SO.  I would have been honored to know that he went to his mother and his mother asked, WHAT CAN SHE DO TO MAKE IT BETTER.  His mom rocks.  She was more concerned about what she could do to help you two than any feelings she might have had.  She is vested in your relationship in a way many MIL's would not be.  She saw that you are what makes her son happy and wanted to correct a wrong.  While a MIL is not usually the best person to talk to, in this instance, he was spot on.", "I\u2019ve gotta say YTA.

That\u2019s not fair. \n\nHe spoke to his mum, she was concerned that she was going to be an issue in your decision, and thought the letter would help. It did. Are you happy with your family? Yes? Then just accept it and let it go.", "INFO:\n\n> Anyways I have always told him from the beginning when we were dating that any issues we have should be between us and not to share what we go through with anyone outside our relationship. \n\nSo are you actively trying to isolate and control him, cutting him off from friends, family, even seeking advice from therapists, because that makes it easier to control and abuse him?  Or are you just clueless?", "YTA. He was risking things in order to make thing a better between you and your MIL and make you happy. What could be wrong with that?", "YTA. Expecting that your partner will not talk to other people about your issues is... something else. He did what he needed to do to make everything go smoothly and for 8 years everything was fine, it could be for another 8, 16, 24 years if you just let it go.", "YTA.\n\nNot allowing a partner to talk to others about issues in the relationship is so incredibly unhealthy. Yes, there are clearly limits as to what needs to be shared with others\u2026but nothing at all to anyone is incredibly isolating. If I\u2019m struggling with something with my partner I want to be able to turn to my family or closest friends for advice and maybe another pov or even just to vent. That shouldn\u2019t be limited.\n\nAlso he solved the problem without creating anymore drama. Why are you still worried about this?", "YTA, clearly everything went well and now you just want to be mad or find a reason to be mad over what? Him trying to get his families together and the woman he wants to marry be happy? You need to really do some critical thinking", "YTA. Your husband wanted things to work, he wanted you and his family to get along. He didn\u2019t write the letter himself, he mentioned it to his mom so she could, presumably, put to paper what she has a hard time expressing in words. I get not wanting to air dirty laundry but this is not that. The letter helped your relationship with his mom and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not got his mom wire-tapped on all the trips you two take so your relationship with her is genuine. He just helped the two of you connect and understand each other better. Appreciate this gesture he made as the act of love it was instead of trying to look for a reason to be upset.", "Soft YTA - why are you making such a big deal out of this?  According to you, you're happy!!  So, maybe he bent the truth a bit, but I don't see how it was a outright lie, I'm not seeing any \"I made him pinky-swear to never ever talk to any of our troubles!!!\"  and even then, it's sometimes therapeutic to talk about those things to others (as long as it's not blasting your partner) and get a different outlook on things, how to approach rough patches, etc...\n\n3 kids, happy for the vast majority of your years together, don't dwell on something so small from so long ago, especially if that event actually made things even better!!", "YTA.

Truly. If it were a private issue between you and hubby, then I understand not sharing that with his family. In this particular case, it literally involved his family. In order to protect you, address his mother's behavior, and make sure you were comfortable marrying into all that, he asked him mother to reach out to you. It worked.

Your husband addressed the issue with his family, and suggested a solution. You MIL accepted what her son told her, she reflected and reached out to you in a kind way. 8 years, a good marriage and 3 kids later, you actually vacation with this woman and have a good relationship with your husband.

If she didn't mean those things she wrote, I highly doubt she would've actually written it. \nMaybe he shouldn't have lied about it, but I think most people would have knowing your reaction", "YTA she was unkind to you and it led to issues in your relationship because he gaslight you instead of taking your side. It sounds like he finally stood up to her and she asked how she could fix the mess she helped make. He told her to apologize and she did.", "Do you expect him to lie and hide his feelings from his parents when you guys are going through shit? \n\nMy husband and I have a similar rule. We don\u2019t make it a habit to bitch to our family about each other. We also don\u2019t go into great detail about our relationship issues. We don\u2019t want our family to judge us based on our worst moments. \n\nBut there are times where our struggles effect our moods and it\u2019s clear to the people closest to us. There\u2019s also times when advice from our parents who have been married 20+ years, is really helpful! They\u2019ve been where we are. It\u2019s smart to use them as a resource. \n\nYou\u2019re happy. Don\u2019t let a mistake from 8 years ago ruin what you have. Moving forward, ask him if this rule is still something he agrees with. Maybe consider a better balance between control and privacy.", "YTA. You need to let it go. It was 8 years ago. Stop living in the past. Your husband wanted to salvage your relationship and made steps to make that happen.", "Plain YTA.", "YTA.", "INFO given your rule of not sharing your relationship with others, why are you posting this?", "YTA", "YTA.

Whatever the catalyst, your relationship with your MIL improved.", "If my husband said I couldn\u2019t share or talk about my marriage to my mom\u2026.I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve married him. It\u2019s not like your husband was slagging you off to his mom or anything. Being married to someone doesn\u2019t mean you OWN everything about him. If you don\u2019t trust him to share his troubles within reason then you shouldn\u2019t have married him.", "YTA\n\nSo neither one of you can ever discuss your problems with someone else? What a weird, unhealthy boundary. \n\nWhat are loved ones for if not to share our serious problems with?

Not only is it absolutely unreasonable to expect people to never talk about relationship issues, him doing so improved your relationship.", "Your husband should not be involving your family in your marital difficulties.  However, that is not what happened here.  He reached out to his mother to resolve a concern you had with her.  This was an act of love and of support for you, not of betrayal.  He knew you had what was obviously a misconception about his mother for some thoughtless words and he told her where she messed up so she could correct it.  How is this a betrayal?  Would you have rather spent the past 8 years at odds with what has turned out to be a wonderful woman that you're very close to?\n\nI don't know if Asshole is the word I'd use but you are definitely wrong.", "YTA.", "Lady you are just trying to find trouble with your husband where it isn\u2019t.

They\u2019re his family and he expressed a concern, she tried to make amends and you say your relationship has been better since. You need to let this go. Of all the hills to die on, this one is a silly one", "YTA Why are you carrying a grudge for 8 years? They both obviously love you, you should be thankful and you ALSO should let it go. It's unreasonable to expect people to never talk about certain things, and it sounds like it was a one time thing. 8 years is RIDICULOUS!!!!!!", "YTA. Your husband did the right thing despite your idiocy. Don't double down on the idiocy and ruin your relationship now.", "If this is the only/ worst thing your husband has done, YTA and I feel sorry for him. \n\nAre you getting upset because this is a pattern for him? That's the only reason you should be upset.", "YTA A big one.\n\nYour husband sounds a nice, caring man.\n\nYou sound like a petty, vindictive person.", "Yes.", "NAH it's understandable that you are upset with your husband for sharing your private problems publicly with his family. Nevertheless, the outcome is a happy one. Your husband's motives were good, and your MIL's letter is, regardless of how it came about, genuine. Honestly, I would kill to have a letter like that from my MIL. Rather than see this memory as a betrayal, why not try to view it as an example of loyalty he had towards you to have the tough conversation and fight for your place in his family?", "I mean... I can understand why you don't want your problems aired out for everyone to know, but this seems to have had nothing but benefits for you. If you want my opinion, I think what you should have done was talk to your husband about it, tell him you appreciate what he did to fix things between you and your MIL and then just ask him not to do it again because that is a boundary for you. I don't see the point in getting mad at him over something that was done eight years ago.", "I get why you are mad, but don\u2019t stay mad long.

And if they apologize now how do you know if real when the once all those years ago wasn't.....not saying you can't come back from this but you completely jusitfied in not just letting it go.", "NTA OP, but your husband is.", "Some of these comments are really harsh, ultimately it\u2019s wether you want to be with your husband or not? \nAsking his parents for advice or them offering isn\u2019t the end of the world.

This wasn\u2019t an ultimate betrayal. This shouldn\u2019t create such a serious amount of doubt. This doesn\u2019t change the happy stable relationship she has with both her husband and MIL now.
