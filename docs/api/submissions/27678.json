I (F34) and my husband (M34) have been married for 8 years, together for 10. We have a happy married life with 3 b3autiful children. I have a wonderful relationship with my husbands side. However, 8 years ago before we got married, we were going through a rough patch. Certain comments made by his mother made me doubt whether this is the kind of family I want to be a part of. My then fianc\u00e9 (now husband) had told me that it was a misunderstanding and sometimes my MIL is rough around the edges and what she says doesn't mean what she meant to say and that i was taling it the wrong way. Anyways I have always told him from the beginning when we were dating that any issues we have should be between us and not to share what we go through with anyone outside our relationship. While we were going through the rough patch and I was having doubts, my husband surprised me with a bbq get together with both his and my family as a pre wedding celebration. During that event, my MIL slipped me a letter and told me that it was just between her and me. Needless to say, when I got back home that day and I read the letter, it was one of the most heartfelt letters I had read. My MIL reassured me that she would always care for me, and that mine and her son's happiness was all that she cared for. There were a few other things that honestly made me tear up. After getting that letter, mine and my MIL relationship improved significantly and any doubts I had were erased. Now fast forward 8 years, last week my FIL accidently let slip to me that my husband had told my MIL while we were going through the rough patch and of my doubts about getting married to him. My MIL has asked what she could do to make it better, and my husband had put it in to her mind to write that heartfelt letter all those years ago. Despite telling him then, not to share our personal things with others outside the relationship, my husband broke my trust and did it anyway. I have asked my husband if he did it, he admitted he did but only because he says he knew it would make me feel better and not to feel like his mother was going to make our married life difficult. I am now confused as on one hand the letter definitely improved our relationship, heck we even go on short getaways just me and my MIL, on the other hand my husband violated trust. I am now mad at him. So Reddit, AITA ?\n\nTLDR : Husband told his mother we were going through a rough patch before our wedding. She writes letter that improves our relationship.

Are you looking for reasons to be unhappy? You\u2019re upset that your husband tried to improve the relationship between you and his family? It also seems pretty wild to explicitly limit who your husband can speak to about his relationship.", "YTA here. I think what you need to realize is that asking him to blanket not share any problems outside of the relationship was both unrealistic and not helpful. You are mad at him for breaking your trust, which is a fair initial reaction, but you should also recognize you made a serious mistake by asking him to make that promise in the first place, especially when what he \"aired out\" was specific issues you had with his mother.\n\nLike, you had serious relationship difficulties because of his family, but asked him not to talk to them about those issues at all. Realistically, that meant you made him promise to never try to fix a major issue and commit to his family continuing to act in a way you dislike, which was a terrible idea. I don't know if he \"should\" have pointed that out to you instead of going behind your back, but I don't think you're going to make your life better by getting so pot committed to a very, very bad idea you had; you're basically saying \"I'm mad you didn't let our relationship self destruct and would have rather failed then than be together now in these circumstances.\"", "YTA. You're holding onto a grudge from 8 years ago? Your husband tried to mend things between you and his mother because he cared about your happiness. The letter improved your relationship, and you even have a good bond with your MIL now. Get over it and stop punishing him for something that ultimately had a positive outcome", "YTA...from what i understand the rough patch was because issues between you and his mother...so he didn't \"air\" the problem in your relationship with him...but he pointed on the problem between you and his mother", "He didn't really violate your trust 8 years ago.  The conflict was between you and his mother, he wasn't divulging difficulties in your relationship.  He went to her with the intention of repairing your relationship with his mother and making sure that you were comfortable being part of his family.\n\nYou love your husband and have three beautiful kids.\n\nYou and your MIL get along so well that you go on getaways together.\n\nYou \"told him off,\" presumably he apologized.\n\nKind of feel like you're looking for trouble here.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

Your husband was concerned about that relationship, so he took steps to make it better. The fact that you want to hold this against him is insane, as if you are looking for ways to destroy your marriage. Get counseling, please.", "YTA - not being able to talk to others about your relationship is not healthy, it is also just a super toxic request to make.\n\nThat is the type of request that abusive partners make to isolate the SO from the rest of their loved ones.\n\nYour husband handled it in a mature way. He went to his mom and said \u201cyou are being mean to my partner, apologize\u201d to which MIL was amenable and your relationship improved as a result.\n\nYour husband was more mature 8 years ago than you are today.\n\nGrow up and get over yourself", "YTA! You are unnecessarily grasping at straws for unknown reasons. \n\nSo your husband did a sweet thing and now that is the reason for your unhappiness? Really?", "YTA People have relationships. They talk. If you want everything in your relationship to be secret you should never have married. Suck it up. He was trying to improve the relationship between you and his mother.", "YTA... why are you looking for something that happened so many years ago as something problematic when you yourself say you have a happy marriage and a great relationship with your MIL...

To be married to someone and expect them to never speak to anyone outside your marriage is unreasonable, especially during difficult times.  Everyone needs to vent.  Sometimes others can give us insight or a different perspective into issues in a way we can't see ourselves.  It is not always healthy to vent to your SO.  I would have been honored to know that he went to his mother and his mother asked, WHAT CAN SHE DO TO MAKE IT BETTER.  His mom rocks.  She was more concerned about what she could do to help you two than any feelings she might have had.  She is vested in your relationship in a way many MIL's would not be.  She saw that you are what makes her son happy and wanted to correct a wrong.  While a MIL is not usually the best person to talk to, in this instance, he was spot on.", "I\u2019ve gotta say YTA. This seems like a small issue to be taking so seriously. You can\u2019t really expect your husband not to sound off to anyone about any issues. That\u2019s not fair. \n\nHe spoke to his mum, she was concerned that she was going to be an issue in your decision, and thought the letter would help. It did. Are you happy with your family? Yes? Then just accept it and let it go.", "INFO:\n\n> Anyways I have always told him from the beginning when we were dating that any issues we have should be between us and not to share what we go through with anyone outside our relationship. \n\nSo are you actively trying to isolate and control him, cutting him off from friends, family, even seeking advice from therapists, because that makes it easier to control and abuse him?  Or are you just clueless?", "YTA. He was risking things in order to make thing a better between you and your MIL and make you happy. What could be wrong with that?", "YTA. Expecting that your partner will not talk to other people about your issues is... something else. He did what he needed to do to make everything go smoothly and for 8 years everything was fine, it could be for another 8, 16, 24 years if you just let it go.", "YTA.\n\nNot allowing a partner to talk to others about issues in the relationship is so incredibly unhealthy. Yes, there are clearly limits as to what needs to be shared with others\u2026but nothing at all to anyone is incredibly isolating. If I\u2019m struggling with something with my partner I want to be able to turn to my family or closest friends for advice and maybe another pov or even just to vent. That shouldn\u2019t be limited.\n\nAlso he solved the problem without creating anymore drama. Why are you still worried about this?", "YTA, clearly everything went well and now you just want to be mad or find a reason to be mad over what? Him trying to get his families together and the woman he wants to marry be happy? You need to really do some critical thinking", "YTA. Your husband wanted things to work, he wanted you and his family to get along. He didn\u2019t write the letter himself, he mentioned it to his mom so she could, presumably, put to paper what she has a hard time expressing in words. I get not wanting to air dirty laundry but this is not that. The letter helped your relationship with his mom and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not got his mom wire-tapped on all the trips you two take so your relationship with her is genuine. He just helped the two of you connect and understand each other better. Appreciate this gesture he made as the act of love it was instead of trying to look for a reason to be upset.", "Soft YTA - why are you making such a big deal out of this?  According to you, you're happy!!  So, maybe he bent the truth a bit, but I don't see how it was a outright lie, I'm not seeing any \"I made him pinky-swear to never ever talk to any of our troubles!!!\"  and even then, it's sometimes therapeutic to talk about those things to others (as long as it's not blasting your partner) and get a different outlook on things, how to approach rough patches, etc...\n\n3 kids, happy for the vast majority of your years together, don't dwell on something so small from so long ago, especially if that event actually made things even better!!", "YTA.

Truly. If it were a private issue between you and hubby, then I understand not sharing that with his family. In this particular case, it literally involved his family. In order to protect you, address his mother's behavior, and make sure you were comfortable marrying into all that, he asked him mother to reach out to you. It worked. The letter was heartfelt and she clearly meant what she wrote.\n\nNAH because I think you feel blindsided, but I also don't think there was any malice on your husband's part or your mother in law's, and I don't see this as a breach of trust given the circumstances. Your husband addressed the issue with his family, and suggested a solution. You MIL accepted what her son told her, she reflected and reached out to you in a kind way. 8 years, a good marriage and 3 kids later, you actually vacation with this woman and have a good relationship with your husband. Please focus on the fact that he stood up for your to his mother - that's a rarity!", "NTA.  Your whole relationship/marriage was based on a lie that your husband told.  He betrayed you by breaking your trust.  Do with that what you will.", "I really have to go with NAH. Yes Husb/fiance did technically go against your agreement and you are right to feel at least a bit violated by that. But he did so to try to make things better, and it worked. Had he not done so, the rough patch might have led to a complete derailment of your relationship. IMHO you should accept that you have a good relationship now and move forward. There are better uses of your time and spirit.", "YTA!!!", "YTA. He\u2019s entitled to share his worries with whoever he wants. Especially his family.", "YTA. Your MIL could easily have responded to your husband's request with... nothing. She could have made it clear that she doesn't like you and torpedoed the marriage early on. Instead, she did her very best to improve a bad situation, and it actually WORKED. Hurray!\n\nYou need to rethink this. Your husband fixed a broken relationship, which is very hard to do. He's a smart guy. You should trust his judgment.", "We all need to vent and to share experiences to help with emotions and decisions. Your mother in law didn\u2019t lie in her letter, so hope you can continue to be happy and trust your entire family!", ">  I think what you need to realize is that asking him to blanket not share any problems outside of the relationship was ~~both unrealistic and not helpful~~ at best, isolating and controlling; at worst, abusive.", "I agree. I suppose op would be warranted in feeling bitter if MIL still turned out to be a biatch and her hubby just manipulated the situation to appease her fears and trap her in marriage with nightmare inlaws. \n\nBut that isn't the case here.
