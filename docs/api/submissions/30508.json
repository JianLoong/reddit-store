Your friend got on my nerves just reading that. \n\nNTA", "ESH\n\nFuture Grandma celebrates the mistakes of her son, who hasn't finished education, has no income and lets a disabled girlfriend pay the bills. You're right, not everyone would consider this grounds for celebration. Being around people who only talk about offspring of whatever kind is also annoying - it's becoming their sole focus and for some reason they expect it becomes everyone else's focus as well.\n\nAt the same time - the way you went about things was AH behavior, no doubt. Your friend's son's mistakes are his to make - if your friend is aware of the details of the situation and is still happy about it, then it is her right to be. If you don't want her future grandchild to be the only topic of conversation, then this can be said in a friendly way and if she ignores this, then you can still distance yourself or become more assertive about being unwilling to talk about her grandkid.\n\nMaybe Elaine is right, are you jealous? Not of Elaine becoming a grandma, but Elaine giving less attention to your friendship and the interests you share? You speak of her and her son in such a harsh tone, it's really hard to see the friendship part. Not just the things you said to her, but the way you described the whole situation are telling.\n\nLong story short, Elaine sucks for not raising a son, who got his life in order, before he brought a new one into the world he is responsible for. You suck for lashing out towards Elaine, because she is overly excited about the grandchild.", "YTA. Wow, you start right in on denigrating her son and his disabled girlfriend, completely fail to reflect on why your friend might consider being a grandma to be good news, and then threaten to break contact with your friend if she doesn't stop being excited about becoming a grandma.\n\nDo I have all that right?\n\nLet me see if I could reframe the facts you shared: My friend Elaine just got news that she's going to be a grandma. Her son is still in college, so their only source of income is from the mom (his girlfriend). That sounds like a tough road, but it's good to see my friend happy, and I hope she can be involved while the new family gets their feet under them.", "Going with NTA.\n\nWhile her son is clearly making mistakes, if she is choosing to focus on the blessing of a grandkid, then so be it.
