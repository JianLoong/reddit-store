As soon as my dad leaves the room Sue completely changes. She will ignore me, make rude remarks about what I am doing or wearing and generally be as mean and difficult as possible. She also does this with my sisters.\n\nRecently my dad took me out for my birthday and whilst we were talking he said he had something important to discuss with me. He said that Sue had spoken to him and said that I have been extremely rude to her recently and been making her feel uncomfortable. Then he went on a 5/10 minute lecture about how I need to kind to her and he doesn\u2019t know why I am being rude when I am normally a nice person. During those 10 minutes I just sat there trying to process what he was saying and figure out what I had done. \n\nWhenever Sue is unkind to me or makes it uncomfortable I will not retaliate or be rude as it will not help the situation. I tend to excuse myself to go to the bathroom for 5 minutes so I can sit quietly and think. Recently it has been building up as my sisters don\u2019t stick around much anymore And I have been taking most of her bullying, I\u2019ll just sit and have a cry for 2 minutes to try and process feelings\n\nBack to my birthday,after my character assassination my dad left for a bit. When he returned I had time to think about what he had said and the situation. So I decided to tell him my side of the story and what Sue is like when he is not around. Then he got annoyed at me for not accepting what he had said and for not apologising for how horrible I have been. That he wished I had just kept it to myself. \n\nStating that sharing my opinions with him isn\u2019t solving anything and just causing more issues for him. That he was going to support Sue and her feelings and that by telling him how i felt was ruining his hope for a happy family.\n\nBaring in mind one of my sisters doesn\u2019t talk to him at all anymore.
