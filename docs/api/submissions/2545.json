If there is an \u2018ist\u2019 or \u2018phobic\u2019 she is it. Overall she is not a pleasant person but she is my dads wife and the family have had to accept her.\n\nRecently Sue has been complaining about how I am \u2018rude\u2019 + \u2018horrible\u2019 to her and make her feel uncomfortable in her home. I find this quite funny to be honest. As I only see her about 2 or 3 times a year, I manage to fit quite a lot in!\n\nbackground- my dad and Sue got married when I was 15, Sue had always hated children so I was not invited to their wedding but my two older sisters (over 21yrs) were and also her bridesmaids. \n\nSue started to speak to me after I turned 19 but only to be rude\n\nThe difficult thing is Sue pretends to be nicer (civil is probably a better word) to me when my dad is around. As soon as my dad leaves the room Sue completely changes. She will ignore me, make rude remarks about what I am doing or wearing and generally be as mean and difficult as possible. She also does this with my sisters.\n\nRecently my dad took me out for my birthday and whilst we were talking he said he had something important to discuss with me. He said that Sue had spoken to him and said that I have been extremely rude to her recently and been making her feel uncomfortable. Then he went on a 5/10 minute lecture about how I need to kind to her and he doesn\u2019t know why I am being rude when I am normally a nice person. During those 10 minutes I just sat there trying to process what he was saying and figure out what I had done. \n\nWhenever Sue is unkind to me or makes it uncomfortable I will not retaliate or be rude as it will not help the situation. I tend to excuse myself to go to the bathroom for 5 minutes so I can sit quietly and think. Recently it has been building up as my sisters don\u2019t stick around much anymore And I have been taking most of her bullying, I\u2019ll just sit and have a cry for 2 minutes to try and process feelings\n\nBack to my birthday,after my character assassination my dad left for a bit. When he returned I had time to think about what he had said and the situation. So I decided to tell him my side of the story and what Sue is like when he is not around. Then he got annoyed at me for not accepting what he had said and for not apologising for how horrible I have been. That he wished I had just kept it to myself. \n\nStating that sharing my opinions with him isn\u2019t solving anything and just causing more issues for him. That he was going to support Sue and her feelings and that by telling him how i felt was ruining his hope for a happy family.\n\nBaring in mind one of my sisters doesn\u2019t talk to him at all anymore. And neither of my sisters have ever liked or got on with Sue. So I am not sure how I am the only person who is causing a problem.\n\nSo AITA for telling my dad my side of the story?", "created_utc": 1668686035, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxobft/aita_for_stopping_my_dad_from_having_a_happy_and/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your dad isn't interested in the truth. If he were, the fact that ALL of his children hate his wife (and that one has completely stopped speaking to him) would be a massive wake-up call. \"Ruining his hope for a happy family\" is manipulative garbage; what he's really telling you is \"I know the asshole wife I married isn't going to change, so I was hoping my children would actually just suck it up and act like everything's cool.\"", "NTA.  OP, dad's reaction had nothing to with you, and the fact that your one sister is NC with him us very telling.  His only concern here is HIS comfort and ease of life and he's lashing out.  Limiting contact is a healthy response.", "NTA. You haven't stopped him from having a harmonious family. He has. He married a woman who thought it was appropriate to exclude his child from his own wedding. Even without everything else you've said, that should have been a major red flag.\n\nOne of your sisters has gone no-contact, and if he carries on, you are likely to do the same. You've told him the truth. Tell him every time it comes up. \n\nI would even suggest putting in a boundary now you are an adult, \"I'm happy to make plans with you but I won't be around your wife and I will not be bad mouthed by her anymore. I have not lied and won't be talked down to because of the things she's said.\" Be prepared to follow through on it if it carries on though.", "If this is an accurate depiction of what's going on, then NTA. Sue sounds like the worst sort of manipulative narcissist and your dad is weak as hell - at best. I'm almost surprised that your dad didn't abandon you in a forest alone, where you could later find a gingerbread house...", "NTA, I understand he might be in love and have the rose coloured glasses on, but he needs to understand its putting you at jeopardy.\n\nIf I were you I'd go towards getting some evidence, try and record a conversation with her in secret if you can or just anything that could get him to see her true colours.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this OP, best wishes for good luck to you.", "NTA. Next time Suzie gets nasty with you, record it, then show it to Dad.", "NTA. I'd start secretly video taping her.", "NTA go NC with dad and sue. I doubt you will be missing anything good.", "NTA, but maybe you should just go NC with Sue. It seems like your sisters have already, so why are you bothering? If you have to spend time with her to spend time with your dad, then maybe go LC with him too, then maybe he'll notice his kids aren't around anymore.", "you actually ...don't.\n\nYou don't have to accept verbal abuse.\n\nyou don't have to accept being around anyone who's \"ist\" or \"phobic\".\n\nYour father chooses to be with this person. You're grown now, you don't have to tolerate that kind of nasty behaviour.\n\nSet boundaries. \"speak to me nicely or I will no longer speak to you\". Record her (in compliance with your local recording laws, ofc) Show your dad.\n\nOr just tell your dad that you choose your own well being and mental health, and go NC. Your sister knows this already.\n\nYou have no responsibility to keep talking to them. You're not responsible for anyone else's feeling except your own.\n\nNTA be kind to yourself.", "NTA. Your dad doesn't seem to notice that you and your sisters don't like Sue, and one has gone NC with her. I think he's being shortsighted and blaming you for what Sue has caused in your family. Is there a way to record her the next time you're alone with her, when your dad isn't around? I don't know if that will convince your dad, but it's worth a shot.", "NTA for telling him,  but it won't do any good. He's made his choice and it's not you and your sisters,  it's his wife.", "NTA. \n  \nIs it because you are still around at all? Even if it is only 2-3 times a year.  \n  \nYou can't be doing anything if you never see her.", "NTA. Start taping what she says when he is out of the room", "NTA. You Tell your father the truth and he choose his wife over you.", "It's pretty obvious it's bad for your mental health to be around your dad and stepmom. \n\nThey're both unpleasant sorts, which is why they fell in love. \n\nI get the feeling your dad never gave you stability or love. You don't owe him anything as a matter of fact. \n\nI think you might find it liberating to cut back on contact as much as you can.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
