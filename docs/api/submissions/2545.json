As soon as my dad leaves the room Sue completely changes. She will ignore me, make rude remarks about what I am doing or wearing and generally be as mean and difficult as possible. She also does this with my sisters.\n\nRecently my dad took me out for my birthday and whilst we were talking he said he had something important to discuss with me. He said that Sue had spoken to him and said that I have been extremely rude to her recently and been making her feel uncomfortable. Then he went on a 5/10 minute lecture about how I need to kind to her and he doesn\u2019t know why I am being rude when I am normally a nice person. During those 10 minutes I just sat there trying to process what he was saying and figure out what I had done. \n\nWhenever Sue is unkind to me or makes it uncomfortable I will not retaliate or be rude as it will not help the situation. I tend to excuse myself to go to the bathroom for 5 minutes so I can sit quietly and think. Recently it has been building up as my sisters don\u2019t stick around much anymore And I have been taking most of her bullying, I\u2019ll just sit and have a cry for 2 minutes to try and process feelings\n\nBack to my birthday,after my character assassination my dad left for a bit. When he returned I had time to think about what he had said and the situation. So I decided to tell him my side of the story and what Sue is like when he is not around. Then he got annoyed at me for not accepting what he had said and for not apologising for how horrible I have been. That he wished I had just kept it to myself. \n\nStating that sharing my opinions with him isn\u2019t solving anything and just causing more issues for him. That he was going to support Sue and her feelings and that by telling him how i felt was ruining his hope for a happy family.\n\nBaring in mind one of my sisters doesn\u2019t talk to him at all anymore.

Tell him that is why I have now start recording her because she lies and blames me when I don't do shit.\n\nYour dad seems to me he's just happy he's getting laid.\n\nYNTA", "NTA i am so sorry. You should secretly record her tbh.", "NTA can you record her to show your dad ?", "The next time you're around Sue, record it. THEN show your dad the truth. Make him eat crow.", "NTA. I'm sorry that your Dad is refusing to hear what you are saying. I would visit your Dad separately from Sue. If he can't accept that boundary, I would consider going NC with him.", "NTA. Your dad is though for being so willing to blatantly taking her side. When if none of his kids like, or really want to put up with her, how can it be one childs fault?", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry for your situation, it sounds frustrating, exhausting and painful.\n\nI'd remind Dad that one of his children doesn't speak to him anymore, and then let him know that now there are two, and tell him to think about the reason.", "NTA. Sometimes we have a picture of who we want our parents to be and a lot of times they don\u2019t live up to that picture and that can be hard to face.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that he is not listening but sometimes we can\u2019t force someone to listen to something they don\u2019t want to hear. \n\nThe #1 important thing here is to protect yourself and your mentality. You may have to put some additional distance between you and dad for now and maybe for awhile. You are worthy of being listened to and feeling safe.\n\nAlso you are not responsible for your parents\u2019 happiness. I will repeat that again for everyone - you are not responsible for your parents\u2019 happiness. Sometimes as parents we put too much pressure on our kids saying \u201cyou make me so happy\u201d but some kids can internalize that and think they have to make their parents happy. You are responsible for your own care and happiness only (and even that can be tough at times). \n\nHopefully your dad does some self reflecting and allows space to recognize some of the very real issues he\u2019s brought upon himself. But that\u2019s his issue to discover and explore and you are not responsible for that - especially if you have done nothing but try your best. Don\u2019t stoop to her level but don\u2019t lose a wink of sleep over this either. \n\nSending you lots of love. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. Also if you're dad is willing to put up with her -ists and -phobics he might be those himself. I would suggest you and your sisters start recording your interactions with Sue if you have the means to do so. The way Sue is treating you is abuse, and I hope you are able to extricate yourself to a safe situation soon, OP.", "NTA", "NTA. I'm sorry your dad is so obtuse and blinded by you SM.", "NTA, you\u2019re never wrong for advocating for yourself. I\u2019m so sorry your dad is refusing to take his own child\u2019s side in favor of his wife. Do you live with them? You said you\u2019re at least 19 which means hopefully you\u2019re able to move out and go low/no contact with them.", "Yep. Dad wants OP to just take what Sue dishes out- including her lies that OP is rude (leaving the room is not rude when you have been attacked).\nI can see why sisters don't talk to dad. Join them. Dad can be all alone with his AH wife.\nNTA", "Skip dad. Put it on the big screen in front of the whole family. Send it around in an email. Post it on Facebook. Expose her.", "Missing Reasons for $1,000 anyone? This might help you. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/i5zj4p/the_missing_reasons_very_good_read/", "Then you share it on social media.", "If this is not helping, nothing will. I am very sorry for OP.", "He is using his brain, just his little one.\n\nDad needs a reality check and put his flesh and blood first for a change.", "Rather that using his little brain", "Well, your brother must have gotten them after my dad was done with them.", "Yeah, it seems I really didn\u2019t understand what OP was saying with that comment. I have apologised for my mistake.", "Ah, fair enough. Your response (to me anyway)read as though you were saying that both accounts were yours. I apologise for the misunderstanding."]}
