{"id": 27145, "submission_id": "16m5qwd", "title": "AITA for not allowing my brother\u2019s girlfriend to eat my cooking anymore?", "selftext": "Yesterday I 22F made dinner for myself, my brother and 2 roommates, 26-28M. It was supremely exhausting. Really delicious, but exhausting to make. I really hoped to have leftovers more than ever before because I didn\u2019t even want to look at my stove\u2014today I still don\u2019t. Then my brother told me his girlfriend was coming over. I didn\u2019t think anything of it, and they both start eating, which is fine. Everyone who wanted food was fed, and there was a lot left until they both decided to get seconds. That\u2019s fine too, but at this point I\u2019m just thinking, there is definitely enough for me to have a small portion for lunch to bring to work, and I\u2019m content with that. I wake up today, ready to pack some for work, but all of it is gone, she ate the last of it, and her and my brother told me as much. They even left the plates in the sink despite me having done the dishes before going to bed.\n\nI don\u2019t really care about not having the leftovers; I dislike having to spend money on fast food and takeout, but I still can and will do it if I need to eat. What bothers me\u2014and maybe this is a minor thing\u2014is that she never reciprocates. Today she had the nerve to get annoyed with me for asking if she could add one thing to her DoorDash order for me, that I was going to Venmo her for. I do groceries for 4 because it\u2019s 4 of us that live here, not 5. She comes over and eats more than half of what I make (my brother is also not innocent here), sometimes my roommates have to go without or go buy their own food because of her, and I\u2019m supposed to just be okay with that\u2026 why? We go through our groceries quicker and I have to cook more when she\u2019s here eating more than her fair share. I had to have McDonald\u2019s for lunch at work (it\u2019s the closest restaurant to my job that wouldn\u2019t make me get points for being late) today and I don\u2019t even know what for dinner because she just had to have a third plate last night, and she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to get me a sandwich? Some fries? Anything???? That royally pissed me off, so I told my brother she can\u2019t come here to help herself to my food anymore.\n\nShe feels bad now, and my brother argued, \u201cBut your cooking is good! And DoorDash is a lot of money, she shouldn\u2019t be expected to spend it on you,\u201d but groceries for 4 is also a lot of money that I\u2019m spending on food that\u2019s supposed to last, and cooking is a lot of work! How is it supposed to last if she comes around eating more than her fair share? And she does this often! Not even because she\u2019s struggling for food or anything like that, she just likes my cooking. But I\u2019m not a restaurant or a food pantry! I don\u2019t actually expect her to buy me food, or do my groceries or anything like that, but the least she could do is be considerate of the people who actually live here and not eat a majority of our food nearly every time I cook.\n\nAITA or am I just being selfish?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t think to mention it, I don\u2019t cook for everyone just because. Everyone in the house contributes to groceries when they are able. Sometimes they even pay me to make something specific that they want. I wouldn\u2019t cook for anyone that wasn\u2019t contributing something, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be so mad about my brother\u2019s gf doing it.", "created_utc": 1695067467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16m5qwd/aita_for_not_allowing_my_brothers_girlfriend_to/", "score": 1126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then she has the nerve to get annoyed when you request something from Door Dash that you plan on promptly reimbursing for her despite her not reimbursing you for all of the food you feed her. Yeah, you need to put a stop to this immediately. Your brother's an AH for encouraging her to do this& expecting you to make her your problem . He gets laid by her, what do you get?

She sounds childish and ungrateful. I have lived with a number of different roommates, but I have only ever made food for myself. I would never spend money on anyone, who would never do the same.

A few dollars less (friend\u2019s & family rate). If she complains, explain that nothing in life is free, she is making living within your budget increasingly difficult.

Lot of moochers, who took meat, and nobody wanted to help clean. After a couple of these I started leaving my take at my folks and just turned up with raman noodles, put a lock on my door for my fruits/veges and other supplies. 4 weeks later one flatmate was booted out and the other two stepped up significantly to have access to free bounty again.

Also if his gf is eating milk/bread/other staples in the house, he needs to reimburse you for it. \n\nFrankly I think the best thing you can do is move out!!!!!! I can\u2019t see any scenario where your brother will not take advantage of you. I think your other roommates do to. They should each contribute equally to the groceries. If you cook every day then they should do the weekly deep cleaning ( bathrooms, mopping, dusting & vacuuming.)", "NTA. Your only mistake was not portioning out the food you wanted to take to work the next day. I always put my lunch in a Tupperware before letting everyone finish off whatever is left from dinner.", "NTA, but bordering on E S H. This one's liable to filled with commentary on the assholery of your brother and his gf which will feel affirming to read. And they're right! Your brother and his gf are assholes for this level of inconsideration as housemates. They are not holding up their side of the bargain and the household can't carry her for free.\n\nBut you need to **ASSERT BOUNDARIES**!\n\nI'll give an example:\n\n\"... there was a lot left until they both decided to get seconds. That\u2019s fine too, but at this point I\u2019m just thinking, there is definitely enough for me to have a small portion for lunch to bring to work, and I\u2019m content with that. I wake up today, ready to pack some for work, but all of it is gone, she ate the last of it, and her and my brother told me as much.\"\n\nConstantly changing what you are willing to accept based on the actions of others is a result of poorly asserted boundaries. A simple \"I made a big portion so I could bring some to work tomorrow, so please leave a portion\" or even separating your future lunch in tupperware might have avoided the resentment that followed. But the concept of a particularly well-cooked and well-portioned house dinner getting unexpectedly devoured in a single night is not exactly an uncommon or malicious scenario. Whereas someone ignoring your instruction or eating your clearly marked lunch would be a much more flagrant violation of a boundary, and easier to address with the person. \n\nYou (correctly!) see the pattern of inconsideration & these events fester more and more resentment. The goal would be to address these situations directly when they happen instead of letting it fester into a blowup after x many boundaries are crossed.

It was supremely exhausting. Really delicious, but exhausting to make. I really hoped to have leftovers more than ever before because I didn\u2019t even want to look at my stove\u2014today I still don\u2019t. Then my brother told me his girlfriend was coming over. I didn\u2019t think anything of it, and they both start eating, which is fine. Everyone who wanted food was fed, and there was a lot left until they both decided to get seconds. That\u2019s fine too, but at this point I\u2019m just thinking, there is definitely enough for me to have a small portion for lunch to bring to work, and I\u2019m content with that. I wake up today, ready to pack some for work, but all of it is gone, she ate the last of it, and her and my brother told me as much. They even left the plates in the sink despite me having done the dishes before going to bed.\n\nI don\u2019t really care about not having the leftovers; I dislike having to spend money on fast food and takeout, but I still can and will do it if I need to eat. What bothers me\u2014and maybe this is a minor thing\u2014is that she never reciprocates. Today she had the nerve to get annoyed with me for asking if she could add one thing to her DoorDash order for me, that I was going to Venmo her for. I do groceries for 4 because it\u2019s 4 of us that live here, not 5. She comes over and eats more than half of what I make (my brother is also not innocent here), sometimes my roommates have to go without or go buy their own food because of her, and I\u2019m supposed to just be okay with that\u2026 why? We go through our groceries quicker and I have to cook more when she\u2019s here eating more than her fair share. I had to have McDonald\u2019s for lunch at work (it\u2019s the closest restaurant to my job that wouldn\u2019t make me get points for being late) today and I don\u2019t even know what for dinner because she just had to have a third plate last night, and she couldn\u2019t even be bothered to get me a sandwich? Some fries? Anything???? That royally pissed me off, so I told my brother she can\u2019t come here to help herself to my food anymore.\n\nShe feels bad now, and my brother argued, \u201cBut your cooking is good! And DoorDash is a lot of money, she shouldn\u2019t be expected to spend it on you,\u201d but groceries for 4 is also a lot of money that I\u2019m spending on food that\u2019s supposed to last, and cooking is a lot of work! How is it supposed to last if she comes around eating more than her fair share? And she does this often! Not even because she\u2019s struggling for food or anything like that, she just likes my cooking. But I\u2019m not a restaurant or a food pantry! I don\u2019t actually expect her to buy me food, or do my groceries or anything like that, but the least she could do is be considerate of the people who actually live here and not eat a majority of our food nearly every time I cook.\n\nAITA or am I just being selfish?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. She is incredibly entitled. Who eats a third helping of other people\u2019s food? You could offer to have her contribute to the food budget the same as everyone else so you were actually buying for 5. I would start putting your lunch away before others even eat and have it clearly marked.", "I\u2019m not the only one. We all put in some money for the groceries, but it\u2019s me and my brother who actually go out and do the big majority of grocery shopping. I just end up putting in the most because I also do a little in between our big trips so we\u2019re not scrounging for table scraps by the end of the week.", "I worded it wrong in my post, I\u2019m not the only one paying for the groceries, but a lot of times it does come more from my pocket than anyone else\u2019s because I\u2019ll occasionally have to make extra grocery trips. Also, this was never something that was necessary until his gf came around, so I forget  to do it. Everyone in the house knows, if they\u2019ve eaten already, to ask before touching the leftovers because they consider it mine if I cooked it. And the same applies to them. It belongs to whoever cooked it.", "OP didn\u2019t even ask for food or anything back, she just requested the GF add something and offered to venmo for it. GF got mad at *that*", "I\u2019d go so far as to pack up your lunch and divide the rest by four.  Brother can share with his gf if he wants to out of his portion.", "Yes, I should have added that to the post. The reason I phrased it that way is because my brother and I do one big grocery trip at the beginning of the month, and I go on little ones by myself in between so we\u2019re not scavenging for table scraps in the middle of the month.", "Exactly. If this has been going on for at least a week, the GF has eaten $20 or so in ingredients alone. Never mind the OP's labor.\n\nThe GF should feel bad for being a cheap AH. The OP is definitely NTA and I worry she's being used by all the people in this story.", "Also before serving the food, set aside the leftovers and label them. Plus tell everyone that the labeled items are not to be eaten as you cooked extra for your lunches.", "It smacks of the line people employing weaponized incompetence use - But you do it so much better than me!  Fuck that. Learn. There are Youtube videos and, I suppose, Tiktoks, for everything.", "Also, she can cook her own food. Sure, money is an issue, but the labor involved in cooking and cleaning is *a lot.* The idea that it's a choice between OP cooking and DoorDash is bullshit.  The girlfriend and brother can cool their own food.  \n\nNTA.", "Exactly. Let your brother pay and cook to reciprocate what he and his gf eat. He\u2019s responsible for her since she\u2019s his guest. If he\u2019s not reciprocating in terms of money, food, labor etc then let him sort out his own meals and also those of his gf. Tasty or not, I would stop cooking for them: \u201cdid you cook this? Pay for it? No? Then why are you feeling entitled to it. Go make or get your own food\u201d. Also, when I cook, I put a lunch portion aside even before I sit down to eat. Maybe cook just two portions and put half away for your lunch (label it \u201cOP\u2019s lunch\u201d) so he can see that there\u2019s none left for greedy ass or his greedy gf.", "And pitching in also means cleaning up after yourself.", "She\u2019s 29 and lives alone. And I probably will establish those boundaries now.", "Actually I like that idea. I\u2019m definitely not above being petty. We briefly had a roach problem when not everyone was cleaning up after themselves. I caught a few and put them in the problem people\u2019s  dirty rooms. They both watched one crawl up their wall at night.\n\nSuddenly everyone knew how to clean again.", "She knows how, she just isn\u2019t good at it. Like, my brother wouldn\u2019t eat her food for several months because it was so bland and didn\u2019t taste anywhere near as good as some of the cooks in my family\u2019s food. \n\nAlso, I cleaned because I didn\u2019t want to wait for anyone else to clean up. The roommate whose turn it technically was to do dishes was out of town because of a family death, so I did the dishes in his place. The neighboring apartments also both have roaches, and I don\u2019t want any of that in my apartment. I spray the whole house religiously and have motels out for them, but I don\u2019t want to take any chances with dishes being in the sink overnight because the other two aren\u2019t that reliable and will go to sleep and leave them in the sink (clearly).", "You know, I actually did work a food service job, and made way more. This does feel like that job. I think I\u2019m going to apply everything you\u2019ve said here, this was very helpful. Thank you.", "No, we all tend to eat at separate times and usually not even in the same rooms. One of the roommates was out of town, the other was out working overtime and didn\u2019t get back until past midnight when I was asleep. I ate when I was done putting the food away in containers for the fridge, and my brother came in with gf 30 minutes later when I was in the shower. \n\nI tend to forget to put my food in separate Tupperware because everyone else knows the house rules: If you didn\u2019t make it, you ask permission before eating it, especially if the portion is small.\n\nThis has never been a problem or something I had to do or consider until my brother\u2019s gf.", "I only said it was fine because there was still food for everyone else. She then proceeded to eat more of it than anyone else who lives here, and finished it off. It\u2019s fine if you eat seconds. But when you\u2019re going for thirds or more and it\u2019s not even your house you\u2019re doing that at, nor did you ask the person who made the food, I think that\u2019s a problem.\n\nAlso, my roommates do contribute, I didn\u2019t think it warranted mentioning because I wouldn\u2019t cook for them if they didn\u2019t.", "No, the gf is definitely an AH. She routinely (multiple times every week) eats more than one person's share of food despite having never once chipped in for the groceries, she leaves her dirty dishes in the sink for OP to wash (after OP has already washed all the other dishes and gone to bed), and then throws a hissy fit when OP asks her to add something to a DoorDash order even when OP will be reimbursing her. She's quite a big AH, in fact.", "I\u2019m not asking for \u201csomething specific\u201d to be done with the leftovers, I\u2019m asking for my food to still be there the next day?", "Then she either needs to be adding to that fund or your brother needs to be putting in in behalf of her if she is going to be eating there. You and your roommates shouldn\u2019t have to pay for her to eat when she won\u2019t even compensate you by ordering food for you ONCE when you feed her a couple times a week", "You need to end this arrangement because they are taking advantage. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out for my budget and time.  I\u2019m only going to shop and cook for myself from now on.\u201d NTA, except to yourself.", "You need a splitwise or something account. If you are constantly buying common food, the n everyone eating needs to chip in. It's not mean, it's fair. Repeat that to yourself since you seem to have guilt not taking care of others. It's also not fair to your roommates if they are putting funds towards the common meal and then the GF eats a full share (or more). She's being a mooch. That's just the truth.", "If everyone in the house knows make sure she knows this rule as well and set a firm boundary with it. Also as soon as everyone has had 1 plate go gather your lunch for the next day, maybe even put it in a lunch box so it isn't touched. \n\nMy question is does anyone else cook in that house? Because cooking for 4 or 5 can be exhausting so other people should be helping out too.", "Why do you put in more of your own money to cover everyone else? I mean if it was just $5 I probably wouldn\u2019t bother. You should ask everyone to reimburse for those extras you buy. \n\nNTA with your brother\u2019s gf, she should have some manners and not finish food off that she hasn\u2019t paid for and hasn\u2019t even asked if that\u2019s ok. Then not even cleaning up after herself? That really shows a lack of appreciation. \n\nI feel you could\u2019ve had words with your brother earlier though so it didn\u2019t get to this point. Even if you all get past this I think it would just be easier if his girlfriend only was welcome to eat on weekends and when it\u2019s planned. Your brother should find some way to compensate for her and everyone should show some adult manners in communicating about who should be helping clean up.", "Please stop referring to the girlfriend\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d. She isn\u2019t entitled to any share, unless your brother is sharing his own allotment with her. \n\nAdvice: when you\u2019re preparing a meal to serve and you know there will be leftovers, go ahead and pack up what you need for the next day, before you sit down to eat.\n\nIf the girlfriend continues to be greedy, consider saying something like \u201cI\u2019m glad you liked it! You can\u2019t get this kind of food from door dash. Your plate cost me $xx.xx in ingredients alone. Do you want to Venmo that to me, or maybe next time you get food delivery to my home, to get me a sandwich and fries?\u201d", "You are doing the planning etc that is all emotional and physical labor.", "Are you being paid for your labor as well? You started off this post talking about how exhausting it is for you to cook like this. Maybe it\u2019s time for you to start letting your adult male roommates figure out how to support themselves instead of relying on the unpaid labor of women. \n\nIf you\u2019re not being compensated for your time and effort along with the ingredients, you\u2019re getting the raw end of this deal - especially in a situation like this one where you don\u2019t have any leftovers nor the compensation to buy yourself a restaurant meal. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but it sounds like you might struggle with your sense of self-worth and with setting boundaries? It\u2019s okay to tell people \u201cno\u201d and to exist without serving others. It\u2019s okay to let people experience the consequences of their own actions and choices. Your roommates and your brother can learn how to cook for themselves - it\u2019s not hard, they\u2019re just lazy and taking advantage of your inability to set appropriate boundaries. It\u2019s one thing to want to occasionally cook a big meal for everyone to share, it\u2019s another to regularly exhaust yourself cooking and then not even have anything to show for it. You deserve better.", "Is the gf contributing money to the groceries? If not then you aren\u2019t targeting her she just hasn\u2019t contributed.
