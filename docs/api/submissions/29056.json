Your wife is doing that thing where she says one thing but actually means another and wants you to do the opposite of what she says. Basically, when you offered to come home earlier, she should have said yes. Instead she lied and stewed about you not being there, and when you talked again she blew up on you.\n\nI\u2019m not going to act like I haven\u2019t done this before, but that behavior is not fair to your spouse. Just communicate and mean what you say.", "NTA. This arrangement was laid out and signed by her from the beginning. Life happens and she got sick at the same time you were gone, but that\u2019s not your fault. You took care of what you could while being away.\n\nShe\u2019s probably angry because she got overwhelmed with it all. She also should figure out a network of support while you\u2019re not available, she doesn\u2019t need to do it all alone. Talk calmly when you\u2019re back and see how that goes.", "NTA you offered to come back, she rightfully told you to stay with your son. \nBut I guess after being sick and taking care of kids she is just tired and went on an a regular rant. Just go home and cook her something and give her a day of well deserved rest.", "NAH. Your wife has had covid and kids for a week. She likely just got overtired and overwhelmed.", "NTA.  Red Flag, after she telling you that \"she is to lenient about you seeing your son\" WTF is that while her kids live with her and you. \n  Time to lawyer up and move on from that evil person.", "Definitely NTA, bro. While Covid makes a person absolutely miserable, the wife suggesting there some kind of choice between her and  and your son is really f\u2019d up. Sucks but you\u2019re gonna need deal with that nonsense now before it gets any worse.", "NTA\n\nYou offered to come home and she said no, when what she really meant was yes. This is one my my most hated traits, people in relationships need to be able to say what they mean instead of expecting the other person to be a mind reader and getting mad if they don't get it right. \n\nThen she finally told you what she wanted but waiting until an unreasonable hour, my guess this was another game to see if you would drop everything and run to her to prove your loyalty or something. \n\nBut the worst thing here is her telling you that you spend too much time with your child, she has absolutely no right to make you feel bad for doing the right thing. Then she says she has been lenient with you? like she has allowed you to spend time with your son without great punishment and you should be ahppy about that?. Then because you did not do as she commanded she flips and tells you not to come home. \n\nRed flag after red flag here. Has she always been this way or is this new behaviour?", "NTA It seems like there are so many of these posts where people say one thing but actually mean another like some sort of secret test. I understand she was sick and probably overwhelmed; but you did offer to come home and she should have used her words. Expecting you to drive in the middle of the night makes no sense. At least now you know how she really feels in regards to your son.", "NTA! You offered to come home sooner, It's not safe to drive late into the night when you haven't properly prepared for it by getting extra rest.", "NTA", "NTA, being lenient with what allowing you to see your son.  That was the dumbest thing she could of said.  and telling you that you spend to much time with your son that is going to be a point of contention now every time you go.  RED FLAG WAVING", "NTA.  She's been sick and was needy.  Ignore this.  You have a routine that works for you.  Stay the course.", "YTA\n\nGoing away for a week and half every month is an AH move. \n\nHe needs to sort out your custody arangements.\n\nYour wife says she has been leniant, you need to listen to that.", "She just is stressed she no person sucks here all you need to do is show her a bit more care", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is not healthy behaviour and trust me when I say unhealthy behaviour does not resolve itself. \n\nHave you addressed her behaviour before? if you have maybe time to do it with a professional.
