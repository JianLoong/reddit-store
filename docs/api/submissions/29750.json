My partner is representing their company at an event. The event was a few days long and today is the last day. I've mainly just kept myself busy during the day and we would reconnect at night/in the morning.\n\nWell today my partner says that oh its the last day. They'll probably network a bit after but it shouldn't be that late. \n\nFast forward to the afternoon. My partner says they're \"going drinking with the boys\". I was out exploring so I didn't think too much of it. I came home and had a meeting around 10pm (business with someone in a different timezone). I asked if they could pick something up to eat on their way home, no response. \n\nHours pass and I decide fine I'll just go and get something myself but also feeling a bit irritated that now it was after midnight and I still hadn't heard from them.\n\nThey sent a joke a little bit after and that was the last I heard from them. Now it's after 1am, going towards 2am and I still haven't heard anything else from them/they haven't come back. \n\nI'm starting to feel pretty upset. I know that we don't need to spend every minute together but when you have a partner shouldn't you communicate where you are/timing especially when it's this late? \n\nAlso, is someone really \"networking\" after 1am? & if you're just \"drinking with the boys\" shouldn't you tell the boys, hey I have a partner waiting for me? I don't know. Maybe I'm being unreasonable. Am I that asshole for being upset?\n\n\nEdit: adding more info -\n\nThey invited me along because the event was only a few days and they thought it could be a fun vacation outside of the event times (and we would be staying more time outside of just the event days).\n\nWe've been seeing each other for a couple of months.\n\nWe are in a different country but we are in Europe and live in Europe.\n\nEdit 2: the trip is supposed to last another week. It was their idea to bring me as they thought it'd be fun. It isn't a company event. It's a conference in which they're representing the company.  I'm not mad that they're busy. I'm upset that it's almost 2am and I haven't heard from them.\n\n\nEdit 3: I was told we can hangout especially because i wasn't going to stay longer at first. He explicitly told me he would be done around 9/10pm. I also wasn't upset that it ended up going over, just upset that he didn't say anything to me about the time even when I had texted him.\n\nI'm wondering if I'd be TA if i left. I had other plans back home and I was skipping them for him so I'm thinking perhaps if he has his own thing (not even sure if the boys counts as networking) then I should go do my own thing", "created_utc": 1698361934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h9i7u/aita_for_wanting_to_leave_the_trip_because_im/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't expect him to cut it short if he's networking. Even if he's with friends (although I would find this a bit more insensitive). He just didn't say anything.

Did your partner give you any kind of estimate for when they would be back tonight after drinking, or did you just presume that it would be before 2AM (which to be fair is pretty reasonable to assume)? \n\nAlso, you said that you would be spending several more days after the event (so starting tomorrow morning) together, correct?

There is no need to be mad because I really think these may be the growing pains of two people having different communication styles and expectations.  \n\nBecause he isn't the one hungry, waiting and maybe a little bored and lonely from his perspective it's going to look a little different.  \n\nUnless you have the only key to the room I'm not sure why you'd wait up for him.  He may really not be expecting you to.  And if he is stupid drunk it may be in his best interest to crash with a friend rather than getting into a cab where he can throw up or doesn't have his wits about him. \n\nI do think he could communicate better but I think he would probably understand if you told him in a non naggy way that better communication would have been nice.", "He's out having fun. Why does he need to check in? You're being a little controlling. Relax and enjoy your trip, and quit trying to control his movements.", "While he is googling the next place to party he could spend half a second and text you, check in with you, or make sure you are safe/happy. You didn't do anything wrong - this is basic manners in a relationship.

He's in a foreign country with all his belongings in your room, where do you think he's going to go?
