All the grandkids are also getting some money. The amount that my two sons and my daughter are receiving is about 5 times the amount that is in the trust fund that my stepson and daughter got from my husband's parents. \n\nMy husband is now saying that it isn't fair that three of the kids are getting so much more.

I think both sets of grandparents would agree with your point of view.

That is their right.  He wouldn't even do that for his step-sons.  What more does he want?  You to screw over his little sister?\n\nYou mention in a response that your share is set up as a trust so you can draw the interest.  I'd be willing to bet, if he hasn't already, that he suggests you make his son whole out of your share or contribute the interest to your step-son until it's \"even\".

And that they don't want your stepson (or more likely his parents) to take the money if you get divorced. \n\nPersonally I'd want it to be even. I'd want all the kids under my roof to feel like an even part of the family, and I would talk to my husband about how we could make the trust situation even on our end, so that all the kids will have the same amount of savings by the time they go to college or need cars or whatever milestone you'll be handing it over to them. \n\nAnd I'd be making sure all grandparents are treating the kids the same.

If you took money from the account of one child and just gave it to someone else, your kid could use you and you might have to repay them out of your pocket.  That isn't yours or your kids' money and neither of you has the right to decide to reallocate their funds to their step/half-brother.\n\nIf your parents haven't yet made their gifts, I highly recommend that you talk to them about the possible benefits of putting their gifts (for you and your children) into trusts just like your ILs did.  A trust could help protect the money from being misspent or mismanaged.  And it might be able to protect the money if you and your husband ever divorce,bor if you passed away and your husband was left with custody of the kids.

Kinda, yeah. Blended families have challenges and this is one of them. But he needs to look in the mirror and rationalize how it was okay when it was his kids getting money and now it suddenly isn't. \n\nBut ultimately, it doesn't matter since the only ones that can make changes are those in charge of the trust.", "On the other side of the discussion,  this sounds really cool.  A wildlife sanctuary with family cabins?\n\nSorry your husband is being like this, but hopefully he will remove his head from his nether regions.  Is the money worth the argument?

We\u2019re defensive and guarded and unable to do the first time over again.  The next time is just keeping company to fend off the loneliness.  Sad, but true most times it seems.

You should not (and hopefully can not) take it away.", "NTA\nI think your parents offered a fair option.

Imagine if any one of us were that kid...Husband is MOST DEFINITELY not AH either!\n\nIt is \"easier\" to feel defensive about a smaller trust fund.
