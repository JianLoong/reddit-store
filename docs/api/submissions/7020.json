I think both sets of grandparents would agree with your point of view.

That is their right.  He wouldn't even do that for his step-sons.  What more does he want?  You to screw over his little sister?\n\nYou mention in a response that your share is set up as a trust so you can draw the interest.  I'd be willing to bet, if he hasn't already, that he suggests you make his son whole out of your share or contribute the interest to your step-son until it's \"even\".

And that they don't want your stepson (or more likely his parents) to take the money if you get divorced. \n\nPersonally I'd want it to be even. I'd want all the kids under my roof to feel like an even part of the family, and I would talk to my husband about how we could make the trust situation even on our end, so that all the kids will have the same amount of savings by the time they go to college or need cars or whatever milestone you'll be handing it over to them. \n\nAnd I'd be making sure all grandparents are treating the kids the same.

If you took money from the account of one child and just gave it to someone else, your kid could use you and you might have to repay them out of your pocket.  That isn't yours or your kids' money and neither of you has the right to decide to reallocate their funds to their step/half-brother.\n\nIf your parents haven't yet made their gifts, I highly recommend that you talk to them about the possible benefits of putting their gifts (for you and your children) into trusts just like your ILs did.  A trust could help protect the money from being misspent or mismanaged.  And it might be able to protect the money if you and your husband ever divorce,bor if you passed away and your husband was left with custody of the kids.

Or you have cases like this where everyone seems to have taken the blending well and then bam - something like this comes up. \n\nin cases like above I feel on one hand that it sucks and it\u2019s unfair, especially is one set of grandparents treats them all equally and then decides that no, inheritance runs by the biological lines (but on the other hand, can they be judged for this?

Does it suck that some kids will get more? Yeah, it probably does and it will suck to explain it to kids and basically to tell them to suck the circumstances up, but this is how life is. And I didn\u2019t see the husband running to share before when his biological kids were going to be set up, so the husband is completely AH in this for wanting to share now.\n\nSuch. a. minefield.", "OP how confident are you that if the situation is reversed (his parents inheritance is 5x more than your parents) and you asked to pool all of it and split even, that HE will be agreeable to it??????", "If I understand correctly, the situation is something like this (using obviously made-up numbers):\n\n- Your husband's 2 kids (your stepson and your shared daughter) each got 10k from their paternal grandparents. Your 2 boys got nothing.\n\n- Now, your 3 kids (your two boys and your shared daughter) are each getting 50k. Your husband's kid (your stepson) is getting nothing.\n\n- As it stands, your stepson has 10k, your 2 boys have 50k each, and your shared daughter has 60k (10k from paternal grandparents plus 50k from maternal grandparents). In total, all 4 kids have 170k (10k + 50k + 50k + 60k).\n\n- Your parents have offered to split the money between your stepson and your daughter, meaning they would each have 35k (10k each from their shared paternal grandparents plus splitting the 50k from your daughter's maternal grandparents).\n\n- Your husband instead wants to pool all the money your kids have so they each end up with 170k / 4 = 42.5k. \n\n\nIn either situation your daughter would end up with less than she has now, but I feel that your husband's suggestion is the most unreasonable of the two options. It's fine if he wants to even things out between his 2 kids because they both end up with quite a bit in the end (and if this money is for college, the 15 year old definitely needs it more urgently than the 3 year old). But asking you to pool the money from your two sons when he was originally ok with them getting *nothing at all* doesn't sound very fair. I assume that his reasoning is that there's so much money now that evening things out between all 4 kids won't take that much away from your two sons. But he's still asking you to take from them to give to his son, when previously he was happy to keep all the money he had for his 2 kids only.

If there is 'fraud' or 'unconscionable conduct' on behalf of the trustee/s to intentionally deprive the beneficiary of his/her entitlement to the funds, then there will likely not be a statute of limitations - meaning the child could get pissed off when they are in late 20s and 30s and seek to recover the amount taken away from his/her trust, along with interest. \n\nAll in all, not worth it and judging from previous comments, if your partner wasn't happy to do the same prior to finding about your other kids new inheritance, then obviously that should be a red flag for you.", "NTA - he said it was unfair for grandparents to set money aside for kids that came into the family.", "NTA.

The people who are giving out the money get to decide who gets it. \n\nAlso that money being given likely needs to be kept in a separate account for each child until they reach whatever age the giver decides on.
