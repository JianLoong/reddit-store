I get that I\u2019m petty, I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m being an asshole.\n\nThis all started about 8 years ago. My (32F) sister (34F) got married in early 2014 and in November 2014 had the first grandchild (8M), they now have 3 kids between 8 and 3. \n\nMy sister and her husband had a newborn and didn\u2019t want to travel for Christmas so they invited our parents (66M&F) and her husbands parents (60ish M&F) to their house for Christmas Day. I wasn\u2019t invited as they wanted to keep it small and immediate family only.\n\nMy sisters husband is an only child so he had no siblings to exclude. My sister and I have an younger brother (28M) but he lives in another country (he lives in the country he went to uni in) and due to work commitments he can\u2019t get back to the UK for Christmas so we generally see him in the new year. I was the only sibling in the UK that was excluded. At the time I was single so it was very lonely.\n\nThat year I exchanged presents on another day (after Christmas) with my parents. The trouble is that this has become a tradition for them. They celebrate Christmas as a group and I see my parents, sister and nieces/nephew between Christmas and new year.\n\nNow this leads up to this year. I\u2019m engaged and in July I had my baby girl. I for the last 4 years have spent Christmas Day with my fianc\u00e9 and his family. He has a big family (he\u2019s the youngest of 5) and they all have partners and children. So we go to his parents house.\n\nI have no intention of changing my Christmas plans of going to my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family. My sister text me yesterday to say that they are up at 8 and open presents at 10 after breakfast, so I would need to arrive before then. \n\n(This is where I\u2019m petty) \nMy response: oh, I\u2019m invited this year?\nMy sister: obviously\nMy response: So is it having a baby that got me an invite? Or is this just for me? Are fianc\u00e9 and baby girl invited too? (I used real names in the actual text)\nMy sister: *radio silence*\n\nThis morning I get a phone call from my mum. She had obviously been crying. She didn\u2019t actually cry on the phone with me. She again thought it was obvious I would be going to my sisters for Christmas. I calmly pointed out that I\u2019ve never been invited before even when I asked to come. Mum wants me to split the day so both sides can see baby girl on her first Christmas. As Christmas is about the grandchildren. I said no. I\u2019m not spending my Christmas Day in the car. My parents and sister can see baby girl between Christmas and new year as normal. The conversation fizzled out and ended.\n\nAITA for not changing my Christmas plans, so both sides can see baby girl on her first Christmas?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was a sober Christmas and I really wouldn\u2019t enjoy it.\n\nIt was really pointed out that I was young, single and enjoyed going out drinking with my friends. Which I did, but I\u2019m fully capable of staying sober on Christmas to spend time with my family.", "They clearly see OP has having no intrinsic value of her own,its only once she has expelled something out of her vagina that they find of more interest that she is tolerated. Parents and sister share this view and expected OP to, too.", ">We women are not baby machines!\n\nNailed it, this is literally what happened. She wasn't a family member worth to be spending Christmas with, unless she didn't satisfy her parents' sick need of having grandchildren.\n\nNTA", "That\u2019s a lame excuse you were one person to include and were immediate family.  Your parents were invited and they\u2019re obviously not children.  The entire group would have made it about the children.  She\u2019s acting like you were likely to show up drunk in club clothes informing the kids there\u2019s no Santa.  Why change your plans of the tradition she started just because the rod is finally out of her ass for unknown reasons.  You already told partners parents you\u2019d be there as usual most likely.  Christmas is next week,  and she (and frankly your mother to blame here also all these years of this and now) at the 11th hour says change everything now?", "In addition, why can't you \"focus on the children\" as well? Just because you're young and have no kids doesn't mean you don't want to be in their lives, and even if you're not that interested you're still a single mouth to feed who had to spend xmas alone as an alternative. So much BS."]}
