Its a parents job to help their children, even adult children. Kids on the other hand dont owe their parents anything. They did not ask to be born, and should not be expected to work for them for free. Thats crazy. Especially if the parents are not poor, like in this case.", "I guess that\u2019s where we\u2019re different. Yes parents are to help their children, but I feel when children become full fledge adults and are responsible and capable it truly doesn\u2019t hurt to help your parents. I\u2019d feel grateful to be able to help in any case. Doesn\u2019t hurt. Poor or not.", "I think it depends on what you think the point is? \n\nIf you think it is to get the full and absolute unbiased facts from both sides of an issue, and then make a judgement.... \n\nThen yes I agree it is pointless less. \n\nIf it is to be entertained by one person's biased presentation if an issue and issue a judgement then it is not pointless. \n\nThere are a lot of things other people do that I personally consider pointless, and I am sure other people consider some stuff i enjoy pointless. People value different things and that is okay. \n\nThat is my polite way of saying the sub is what it is and it not going to change. So if you can't get down with that it is understandable, but then don't join/follow."]}
