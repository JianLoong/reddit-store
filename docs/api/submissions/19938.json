I include adult children in this. Children who feel that they were neglected, or their siblings received more than they did, or that their parent(s) didn\u2019t care about them, can often scramble for money/property because they yearn for the love and attention of that parent, and the money becomes a symbol of that love.\n\nThis is not to blame parents, necessarily, sometimes the child feels neglected because the parent worked very hard when they were young, so the child never saw them; sometimes it\u2019s because the parent had to focus on a more needy sibling\u2026 life is complex, parenting even more so. \n\nOnly you know what the history of your relationship is, and whether your daughter\u2019s demands could have their source in a feeling of being unloved/unwanted.
