I include adult children in this. Children who feel that they were neglected, or their siblings received more than they did, or that their parent(s) didn\u2019t care about them, can often scramble for money/property because they yearn for the love and attention of that parent, and the money becomes a symbol of that love.\n\nThis is not to blame parents, necessarily, sometimes the child feels neglected because the parent worked very hard when they were young, so the child never saw them; sometimes it\u2019s because the parent had to focus on a more needy sibling\u2026 life is complex, parenting even more so. \n\nOnly you know what the history of your relationship is, and whether your daughter\u2019s demands could have their source in a feeling of being unloved/unwanted.

Explain that the work was essentially done, that you expect it was only going to take \"X hours for X thousand $\" but since you're confident that as a professional she already ran the numbers and knows she's making more than that with her lucrative business, that you're proud of her and excited for her thriving business. Tell her not to worry as it's already been taken care of and that you can't wait to see her at the next family event.

Do you know how much her company takes of commission? Many times a realtor may only see half of their \u201ccommission\u201d.

They don't EVER try to extort MORE MONEY from someone in the family/close friend circle.  We have each other's back, and we also give them referrals if a neighbor or coworker needs the same service, and they DO get paid for that, plus we in turn do a service for them for the same \"wages\". \n\nI'm really sorry you are dealing with this. Some people have a tranactional mindset and will have the \"get all I can get\" attitude and that's hard to find out about a loved one.

There's a lot of anti-realtor talk out there these days, but those folks HUSTLE for their money. \n\nBTW, most people don't know that a realtor has to split that 3% with the brokerage they work with. Often it's 50/50. So it's really usually more like 1.5% and that's before all the expenses they incur personally to market a house or support a buyer through the process.\n\n(None of this changes the NTA, but a little free family therapy OP: Your daughter feels you owe her. If you don't know why she feels that way, it would be good to find out.)", "NTA. I'll be happy to help you out with the paper work. All I ask is 2%. Seriously. Let me know.

Sounds good on paper but sends the wrong message.", "In our case, we completed all negotiations before approaching our realtor. It was a cash sale with no inspection or appraisal.

Our realtor didn\u2019t have to do a home walk through. She didn\u2019t have to take pictures and post them on the MLS. She didn\u2019t have to advertise anything, field phone calls, and all the many things a realtor does to work for their part of the commission. This doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t work, but to say what she DID do is the same as all that I just described is just ignorant.", "6-7% is absurd. What country is this? People have been saying the profession is about to face some disruption and if that\u2019s what y\u2019all are charging I can see why. \n\nThe only way this is feasible is if you live in butt fuck no where and sell houses for 2-300k", "OP is TA.

Since she\u2019s licensed, being involved likely makes her liable to ensure things are done legally regardless of the fact your partner has the paperwork (which I question). It\u2019s also more work for a realtor when the buyer\u2019s don\u2019t have representation- she\u2019s not just doing one side, she\u2019s doing both.", "Even so most people I know with rocky relationships with their parents would still jump on the chance to get easy money from them so who knows", "This is what I was about to comment.

So for instance, if a transaction was paying 6% to the agents' commission, with 3% each going to buyer's and seller's agents, your broker would get 0.3% of the sale amount (10% of your end)?\n\nThat's shockingly low to me, considering the costs I presume a broker needs to cover (providing an office, support staff I assume, overall marketing for the brokerage, etc.). But maybe you're in an expensive real estate market with a lot of volume, so even the very small percentage adds up to meaningful dollars.", "Oooops sorry misread that, I was so confused \ud83d\ude02", "Because to so many people, in this subreddit particularly, man=bad.

With 3 office spaces and god knows how many assistants to pay for, I assume. \n\nI guess with 130+ agents, though, even if only a fraction of those are regularly producing, that small broker's cut must add up. Very interesting. I always wondered.", "Selling above asking doesn\u2019t really mean anything. You could have listed it for cheap.

Banks anywhere will not lend more than the asset is worth that\u2019s just common sense.

The typical FSBO home sold for $225,000 compared to $330,000 for agent-assisted home sales. Not exactly ages ago. \n\nThe fee covers the advertising, appraisal, cost of staging, cleaning it is more than a fair price for all the work involved."]}
