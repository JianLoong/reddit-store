Obviously, all of us are very proud and happy for her, but my mum has been making some comments (not just recently) and it all came to an head today during lunch.\n\nFor context, my sis is very fortunate to be in a stable, long term relationship with a really cool dude, as well as a close friend circle filled with people who look out for each other. While my other sibling also has good friends, my mum and I have not been so fortunate on that front. My dad also cheated on my mum, and this, coupled with mum\u2019s family being an asshole, means that mum doesn\u2019t really have a support system (to speak of). In these past years, my siblings and I have been slowly distancing ourselves away from mum because she is very draining to be around, and I think my mum blames Vic (since she\u2019s the eldest) for our deteriorating relationship with her.\n\nDuring our lunch convo, my mum brought up the fact that Vic doesn\u2019t really seem to hold her in high regard, which (unfortunately) I suspect is true, as Vic doesn\u2019t really go out of her way to appease our mum/spend time with her. I said that this might be because she seems to hold especial hatred/resentment for Vic \u2014 case in point, always badmouthing her, telling me that Vic thinks too much of herself and she won\u2019t actually succeed in life, at which mum got defensive and said, in her exact words, \u201cI\u2019m allowed to say whatever I want when I have emotions, and when your sister (Vic) hurts me. You shouldn\u2019t blame me for what I say when I\u2019m angry.\u201d\n\nI told her that was untrue, that honestly, every insult and curse you give when you\u2019re angry has some element of truth in it. I do think that Vic can be a bit harsh on mum sometimes, and their relationship is the worse out of all our sibling\u2019s relationship, but I think that cursing her relationship/hoping Vic\u2019s bf cheats on her/hoping Vic will lose her job, even in anger, is unacceptable.\n\nMy mum blew up at me and said I was twisting her words and that she wishes all the best for Vic, and that I was \u2018satan\u2019 for trying to wreck her relationship with Vic. But Vic was the one who told me that she feels like our mum resents her?! I do feel terribly guilty now, because I knew this was a sore topic, but I feel like mothers should want the best for their children and it makes me furious for Vic because she\u2019s very scared that her life would turn out like our mum.\n\nMy other sibling and my dad (not actually involved, aside from the cheating) told me to stay out of it and stop provoking her. AITA? I\u2019m not denying that Vic can be a bit of an asshole, I\u2019m just saying that wishing ill on your daughter is a line that I don\u2019t think she should cross.

It's just that your mom is a hopeless case. She's not going to change or learn. Be sure your sibling bond is strong - nourish it - and be thankful for it. Your mom's situation is something you need to manage for YOURSELF, because of the hopelessness of it. What would make you and your siblings feel better? Humor her? Ignoring the bad parts while trying to see the good part? Gray rocking every time you see her? Hardly ever interacting? Whatever. Don't let her get to you. You are emotionally healthy.

Your mom needs therapy.", "My mum did tell me that if it weren't for Vic, she would have divorced my dad. I do get the vibe that she views Vic as a source of...unhappiness?
