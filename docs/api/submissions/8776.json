He came from my wife\u2019s eldest sister. He\u2019s never really had respect for me, I believe it\u2019s due to our age gap (I\u2019m 30). He doesn\u2019t see me as an authoritative figure. He was held back in school before he came to live with us. He will graduate when he\u2019s 19 and says he\u2019s immediately moving out after graduation. We put him in therapy at 9 but by 13 he completely refused to go anymore. \n\nYesterday, I came home from work and my daughter (8) was upset because she couldn\u2019t find her kitten after she got in from school. We looked for probably about 20 mins, finally discovered he had gotten stuck in my nephew\u2019s room. I found him under the bed, up against the wall. The only way I could grab him is if I moved the bed. When I did, I found 23 bottles that had urine in them. Yes, I counted. I put a pair of gloves on and lined them up in the middle of his room. \n\nWith it being Monday, it wasn\u2019t usual for him to walk in the door with his friends. Normally, they come over a few hours after school lets out. But low and behold, he got home with two friends yesterday. I was helping my wife with something in her home office, I didn\u2019t even know he had people with him. He opened his bedroom door and screamed. Probably from embarrassment, the other two kids dipped out. My intentions were to keep it between him and I but later discuss it with my wife because I do strongly think he needs therapy again. Maybe it\u2019s just laziness, maybe it\u2019s not. \n\nHe called me every name in the book, said I should have left them under the bed and told him to clean it out. The way he is, if it wasn\u2019t in his face he wouldn\u2019t do it. I asked him why would he be urinating in bottles when there\u2019s a bathroom directly across from his room. He told me to go f*ck myself, then said he\u2019s sick of having to walk over our daughter\u2019s underwear in the shared bathroom. I opened the bathroom door to find not a single article of clothing on the floor. My wife also confirmed, she consistently uses her hamper and doesn\u2019t find clothes on the bathroom floor. \n\nI asked him to get a trash bag and dispose of the bottles. He instead walked out of the house and left. This afternoon, the bottles are still sitting in the middle of his room. I have told my wife do not touch them, he is to take care of it. Apparently, he told his grandfather what I did. FIL asked me\u2026\u201dSo where\u2019d he learn that from?\u201d Umm, not from me, that\u2019s nasty. My FIL further said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a need for a counselor, he needs his own bathroom.\u201d Oh ok, sure so we\u2019ll just send our daughter to do her business in the backyard.", "created_utc": 1675187036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10q5cyl/aita_for_unintentionally_embarrassing_my_nephew/", "score": 2738, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I removed them, lined them up in the center of his room to send the message \u201chey, I found them.\u201d He arrived home with friends, who all saw the bottles.

My intentions weren\u2019t to cause him embarrassment but to bring the issue out in the open (literally).

He was definitely lashing out from shame. This sounds like compulsory hoarding behavior but I\u2019m not a doctor. Contact a therapist now and start discussing ways to approach this subject because it\u2019s going to be rough going for a bit", ">That\u2019s not a need for a counselor, he needs his own bathroom\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but your FIL sounds like the kind of person who refuses help because it's for 'crazy people'.\n\nHow can anyone defend this kid's actions?  2 years till he's off on his own, he *needs* therapy and good guidance.", "NTA. \n\nBut good lord that\u2019s nasty! Perhaps his grandfather would be willing to take him until he graduates?", "NTA...The kid obviously has problems, but basic human boundaries have to be maintained. Naturally he's embarrassed, but it was his doing.  Your FIL's attempt to blame someone else for his behaviour is concerning.", "Nta, in the absence of any trauma you\u2019ve left out, that\u2019s totally disgusting behaviour", "Future Hoarder... NTA", "NTA\n\nYou had every right to go into his room, because it's your house. It was even okay for you to look under the bed and move the bed, because you needed to find the kitten. It was even okay for you to line up the bottles in the middle of the room, because you had no reason to expect that he would bring friends over right after school.\n\nIt is unfortunate that his friends saw the bottles, because this kid has serious problems, and the shame of having them exposed to his friends -- let alone the bullying he will probably get at school after the friends tell everyone -- is only going to make his problems worse. It would be appropriate to explain that you never meant for his friends to see, and you are sorry that they did.\n\nI suspect your FIL is minimizing the problem because clearly his daughter screwed up, or your nephew wouldn't have been placed with you when you were only 21 and not old enough to be his dad. Your nephew is suffering from trauma, and definitely needs therapy. I recommend Brainspotting, which works extremely well for trauma and doesn't necessarily even require talking to improve the condition. It will require your nephew's buy-in, so maybe you could make him a deal.\n\nHis school life is probably going to be really rough now, on top of the severe emotional pain that has to be behind urinating in bottles. Please try to see his terrible behavior as the sign of pain that it is. Also, having been held back a year is hard for a kid. Maybe he would prefer a GED program? If so, offer support in that option if he'll participate in therapy.\n\nGood luck to you both.", "NTA.  Counseling is absolutely in order.  I\u2019d be curious if he\u2019s been evaluated for any neurodivergence.  It\u2019s not uncommon for some kids to urinate on their floors or into containers simply because they can\u2019t stop doing things (ex. gaming) long enough to use the bathroom.", "NTA. Ew.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he could be employee of the month at Amazon warehouse/delivery.", "NTA. He definitely needs to take care of the bottles himself and he definitely needs some sort of therapist to figure out how to straighten up and act like the near-adult he is.", "Nta.  The kid is either collecting urine for when gets drug tested or he's so lazy and doesn't want to leave his room to take a leak when he's playing video games.. Either way he's got to go", "Definitely NTA. That is disgusting and completely unsanitary. Also, he's a little jerk for how he responded to you.", "NTA. \nIf he\u2019s not selling his pee or storing it to not get caught for drugs, then he needs to see some doctors asap because that is not a healthy habit and very alarming.", "Nta, nasty AF.  I also have a sibling like this. Logic can't be applied in the same way with them, it has nothing to do with the effort required it's them not wanting to leave the room no matter what. \n\nAbsolutely leave them where they are and you handled this fine imo, he should be embarrassed by this, it's not normal behavior", "You found *what*? \nEwww, yuck. NTA\n\nHow did the kitten get stuck under the bed, up against the wall, anyway?", "NTA - kid is disgusting. I feel sorry for whoever ends up with him.", "NTA I don\u2019t think you intended to show his friends.", " An you even imagine if the cat knocked the bottles over?? Ick. NTA.", "NTA, but maybe approaching him with empathy and curiousity would give you better results than expecting a therapist to make him act right. \n\nAs the parent of young adults, this is nasty, but not terribly unusual. I have three friends that have confided finding similar stashes in their teen boys' rooms.\n\nThese guys were all too focused on whatever they were doing to visit a toilet less than 10 feet from their stockpiles.\n\nYour nephew isn't willing to take accountability for his behavior right now, but that's developmentally pretty normal, too. It's gross, but I'm pretty sure all teenagers do revolting things as they grow into their prefrontal cortexes.", "NTA. That is sooooo nasty. He definitely needs counseling.", "NTA- he is a nasty thing. yuck! that is just pure laziness.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to stop and to clean up after himself.  And therapy is a good idea.  That's beyond laziness in my book.\n\nFIL can mind his own business.", "NTA and I find it very concerning how the cat was trapped there. Are you certain he hasn't been torturing the cat?", "NTA, this kid needed to be exposed as a serial bottle urinator, nasty", "NTA.\nYou are kind enough to take him in.let him have friends over. Give him his own room. Pay for his therapy and all other stuff while he doesn't have respect for you considering what have you done for him. And also calling you names???\n\nAll I am saying is the kid has problems and they need to be dealt with and not be ignored.", "> \u201cThat\u2019s not a need for a counselor, he needs his own bathroom.\u201d \n\nYeah...rewarding that kind of behavior is an EXCELLENT idea! /s\n\n~~ESH~~ NTA. You did go into his room without his permission (*Changed ruling to NTA because* - but you did that because the kitten could get into trouble without water for the many hours it would have been trapped if you hadn't gone in)...but man, he's peeing in bottles and stashing them!! In YOUR house!  Health hazard aside (and it is a health hazard), the mental gymnastics associated with thinking that was an okay thing to do really should be addressed. By a professional. Especially if he is resisting this hard to cleaning it up and stopping the behavior.\n\nETA: Is there a possibility he's involved with drugs? Serious question storing bottles of urine is not uncommon in the drug abuse culture. Stored urine, if it\u2019s \"clean\" and from a non-using individual, can be sold for use during mandatory drug screening for individuals on parole or probation.", "This is an unfortunate incident. You didn\u2019t intentionally embarrass him but you did. You\u2019re NTA but you should apologize for his friends seeing this. Being a teenage boy I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably laziness and nothing more. Just reinforce personal grooming and let this go imho.", "NTA, it\u2019s definitely weird that he does this and he clearly knows it\u2019s wrong because he wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed if he didn\u2019t. I have no advice for you but wish you the best of luck with this. And if he plans on moving out at 19 he\u2019s going to be in for a ride awakening when he has to clean his own piss bottles", "Nta. He does need counseling. Especially a session with you and your wife so he can be asked \"what is the real issue?\" I bet he's mad about his situation, him parents and a lot of other teenager stuff. Just have to get it out. You owe him a sincere apology though. \"I apologize for what happened. I truly didn't mean to embarrass you\"", "Gaming addiction? NTA", "NTA but your nephew probably needs some kind of psychiatric help bc as you certainly know, that is not normal. Is there any adult in his life that you know he trusts and could talk to him? I get that this is super embarrassing for him, but this could sadly be a symptom of something that needs to be checked out, not just a sign of bad hygiene. Maybe if there is somebody who he trusts he might take it better?", "NTA. Your son has issues and letting him continue the way he is now is not going to do him any favors. I'm not one to support parents kicking kids out at 18, but I think it's something you're going to have to consider if he doesn't change.", "NTA, but it's deeper than him being gross. Bodily functions are one of the only things a kid has control over. He's been traumatized and definitely needs to be in therapy. I would also consider moving the hamper to the bedroom and monitoring the children.", "Nta, Wtf, Why? Your nephew deserved that humiliation from his friends? Why the FUCK? How could even live in that room? Some may think you shouldn't have kept it in open, But again, It's his things right? Shouldn't he be somewhat proud? 23 bottles of urine darn impressive lmoa \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "Your son SHOULD be embarrassed of his urine bottles.

I am not saying the behaviour isn\u2019t disgusting, it is, and everyone who does it knows it, believe me I would know. Y\u2019all are so fast to jump on a kid who probably either got trauma or is deep in depression, while actively trying to not have any empathy for the kid, as it was said in other posts it would even maybe come from SEXUAL ABUSE FFS.

I was really good at hiding it, and wouldn\u2019t throw up in the toilet because I was worried the distinctive splash was audible. Instead I would throw up into Tupperware in distant corners of the house, and store until it was safe to dispose. Tupperware meant there was no smell either. I didn\u2019t collect 23 bottles of it; but sometimes it would amount to a bit because a) I was struggling to find a safe \u201cwindow\u201d to get rid of it all and b) I was disgusted with the physical evidence and myself. Denial and self-loathing is a really great way to procrastinate. \n\nWhen I finally got caught, my mother was furious because I had exposed my little brother to this behaviour (he found a container and ratted on me.) She threatened to tell my other brothers and I can assure you this was my worst nightmare - my filthy secret getting out. \n\nI think he\u2019s ashamed of himself, but misdirecting it. Horrible truth, but LOTS of boys do this, for some of them the habit snowballs and likely because they don\u2019t want to deal with or acknowledge the problem they\u2019ve created (much like I did.) Also, just being lazy disgusting primitive teen boys.... \n\nAll the same, he must be incredibly embarrassed his friends have found out this secret. I personally think him lashing out is unreasonable, as well as not disposing of the bottles, but I am also aware this kid has had a very unstable home life until or around when you took him in. \n\nFor the benefit of moving forward, I think you should perhaps consider apologising that you outed him. That it was no way your intention and had you thought about it more, you wouldn\u2019t have broached the matter with him in this matter for fear of outing him. \n\nApproach the conversation from a bio-medical point of view. Say that you\u2019ve had time to think on the matter and that it isn\u2019t the end of the world, you are aware some people do similar things out of necessity and some even in medical settings (ever peed into a cup?!), but it isn\u2019t a good practice because at the end of the day it is a biohazard and the practice will not be ok with future partners. Tell him whilst it\u2019s quite a nasty thing for you to find, you still love him and (presuming he\u2019s not a grot in other aspects of his life) don\u2019t see him as disgusting, just this particular behaviour that is easy to stop / modify. \n\nI would also recommend telling him that you\u2019re taking your wife and daughter out for an activity at a specified time, and that you would like him to use this window of privacy to resolve the issue. I know I would have been mortified if I had to parade my jars of sick in front of the family. Maybe this is contributing to his reluctance in dealing with the bottles of urine. \n\nU/Throwaway92747749\n: I really hope that sharing my dirty secret (haven\u2019t told a soul since my mum screamed at me) helps you understand our stupid teen mentality.

I saved anything and everything as a kid and am recently coming to understand some of my own trauma more fully... are you able to explain what makes that trauma response tick, so to speak? if you know?", "From what I've learned, kids who resort to behavior like playing with their own excrement usually have very severe issues with feeling like they have no control over anything in their lives, so things like pee and poop become an outlet for them to have control over something. \nKids who pee themselves may also have issues holding their bladder, and they may have bladder leaks or they may void their bladder. There's a lot of various reasons for this, whether it's just a trauma/fear response to something or they held their urine for so long and so often they weakened their pelvic muscles to the point they physically can't hold it, and their bladder will relieve itself because the muscles are too weak to hold it. Sometimes this means they will empty their bladder completely, even without meaning to. Some children may also wet themselves for attention, if they figure out that having an accident gets them a response from caregivers, they might pick up that behavior so they can get any kind of attention. That's also why a lot of neglected kids have behavioral issues and act out a lot, even negative attention is still attention, and they need some sort of attention. \nSo there's a lot of reasons a kid might be urinating in their room, it really depends on whether they're consciously doing that or if they have enuresis.", "He had alot of enablers in his life.
