The only reason you\u2019re getting votes to the contrary is because the average Redditor is the asshole who would buy their stupid dog an Amazon service dog vest so they can take their fake service dog everywhere.", "NTA - ALL real service dogs are trained to such a degree they would never act like that. If you\u2019ve seen them you\u2019d understand.", "NTA. As others have stated, properly trained service dogs will not be barking unless there\u2019s an emergency. In which case it would only be logical to check on the person. \n\nFinding someone abusing the system to take their yappy lil ankle biter out and about as a fake service dog would upset most ppl.", "NTA. Fake service dogs cause issues for those that actually need a service animal.", "Every ACTUAL service dog I've ever come across has been extremely well trained and would never bark unless it was necessary.

I don't know, I think ESH.", "I have no idea - it somewhat depends on whether she had a legit service dog or not. Signs point to \"no,\" and I do find fake service dogs annoying. But even if that was the case, what were you expecting to happen?\n\nIf she has a legit service dog, then yeah, she's going to be mad if a stranger gets in her business and swears at her. If it was a fake service dog, then of course she's going to get defensive if a stranger gets in her business and swears at her. Either way, confronting her in a grocery store probably wouldn't accomplish much but make both of your days worse.\n\nSo I'm not inclined to say that you're the asshole here, but you probably would have had a better day if you silently judged her and then moved on with your life.", "ESH. People with fake service dogs are assholes and people who cuss out strangers are also assholes. (IF the service dog was fake, anyway, which there's almost no way of knowing)", "NTA", "Ohh no no no. You don't do that. YTA. Big time. It's not your place to assume that the service dog is fake. Even if she was having some kind of issue that the dog was alerting, maybe she just doesn't want to discuss it with you. Also could have been a service dog in training. You think they're just born perfectly trained to behave in public?", "YTA. You have no legal, or moral, right to ask someone that question. Get off your high horse and move along.", "YTA. \n\nA service dog alerting is not just about a medical emergency. It can be to inform the owner about a danger, a change in heart rate, a trigger or stressor in the area, a drop or rise in blood sugar and a host of other things. Some allergen service dogs alert for allergens in the area. \n\nYou made an assumption and then rudely questioned her. You have no business or right to do so.", "Yes, YTA. I understand your frustration if you're not a dog person and honestly it's entirely possible that it wasn't an actual trained service animal. But you don't know that for sure. It wouldn't have been that hard to just move along. You didn't accomplish anything.", "YTA. Unless you have proof, accusing someone to have a fake service dog is completely out of line.", "YTA\u2014 You do not know their medical history or needs, and it\u2019s also none of your business. Actual service dog or not, you should have minded your own business. Disability isn\u2019t always visible.", "YTA and I say that as a service dog handler. If you suspect a dog is misbehaving then you need to approach the manager of the store who is the only person who can make the call on what to do about it.\n\nIt\u2019s true that pet owners tend to be entitled assholes who think their dogs are welcome everywhere. However most people wouldn\u2019t know what a tasking service dog looks like.\n\nBarking to alert is allowed by the ADA. It\u2019s possible the dog was alerting to its handler and they just didn\u2019t want to tell you. Because it\u2019s none of your business. \n\nI don\u2019t like pets where they don\u2019t belong either. But just as bad as them are the nosy know-it-alls who think they can tell what an actual service dog looks like without ever having worked with one.", "YTA. Let's assume it's a fake service dog. You still were needlessly aggressive.\n\nBut if it was a real service dog, the barking is what is PREVENTING the medical emergency. Barking signals the human part of the service animal pairing to take care of their medical condition BEFORE it causes an emergency", "YTA\n\nService dogs have all kinds of roles.  My friend has a hearing dog that tips and licks/ paws her to alert her to noise and people nearby.  The dog may have been alerting the owner to something legitimate, but that wasn\u2019t a \u201cmedical emergency.  It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a \u201cf-cking fake service dog\u201d just because there isn\u2019t an immediate medical emergency, and it\u2019s not your place to insert yourself or tell someone to leave.", "YTA, and in a huge way. When when you confronted them, it sounds like they replied civilly, and you then flew off the handle. It seems you went into the encounter with a negative attitude, already assuming it was a fake service dog, and looking to validate your feelings and find an excuse to chew them out.", "YTA, asked a question clearly in bad faith as a pre-emptive ploy to verbally abuse them.\n\nIf you're going to be an asshole why not skip the pre-amble.", "Yes, YTA. Just go about your day.", "Yta", "NTA - I'm sure if it was an emergency that the dog was alerting for, you'd have helped this person get the medical attention they require.  This is another case of someone abusing a program so they can take their shitty, yappy, untrained dog wherever they want.", "Actually as a private citizen, you have every right. She's lying, she knows it, you caught on to the tell, she's just pissed. People like her make it harder for those with real service animals to be respected in public. NTA", "So.. a trained service dog wont just bark randomly when its \"on the clock\" but they dont only bark when their patient is dying. They couldve been alerting to other things. \n\nYou could be right, it's very possible, I knew someone who got one of those vests without needing it. Idk how, idk the process, but whatever. \n\nBut it's not up to you to judge whether something is a service animal or not. So.. YTA", "YTA. People with both hidden and visible disabilities require service dogs. In most countries, it is illegal to discriminate against people who need service pets and they are allowed to be all places.

Learn to mind your own buisness.", "YTA", "YTA - I agree this sounds like a fake service dog. However, you aren't the stores security. You should have complained to customer service, not cuss them out. Also...this sounds pretty fake...as I can't see how any normal person would do this and ask AITH?", "Oof that's very bad. It's likely that it was a legit service dog, meaning she needed it and also should never have to prove that to you.", "Yes, OP....YTA. Yes, it's entirely possible that she has a fake service dog. It's none of your business to call her on it. It's on the store to ask her about it, which if I'm not mistaken they aren't allowed to do. You could have just gone to a different aisle to avoid her.", "YTA for sure. You don\u2019t know what that dog is for, and you have no right to that information. You were super rude. Service dogs are allowed, and you don\u2019t get to question someone\u2019s medical status. Invisible illness exists. Get over yourself.", "**Yes YTA.**\n\nSometimes it genuinely shocks me that some of you even feel compelled to ask. The absence of self awareness here is glaring. We get it, you hate dogs. No one cares. Mind your business, it\u2019s not that difficult.\n\nEdit before the *people* see this:\n\n1. Who cares\n2. You\u2019re grocery shopping, not at a spa\n3. Fake service dog or real service dog, is it genuinely affecting you that much?\n4. **Some service dogs are trained to bark in certain scenarios**\n5. Stop berating people for using resources for support", "YTA because there are a lot of reasons between fake service dog and dog alerting here that could be going on. The dog could be in training still, the dog could be alerting but the issue may not be something that results in the need for outside help or medical attention, etc. \n\nYes \u201cservice dog\u201d has gotten abused a lot in recent times but as a fellow patron you don\u2019t really have any place to say anything unless the dog is seriously causing a problem that could result in injury to someone. \n\nI agree it seems suspicious that a service dog would be barking like that but you don\u2019t know what the purpose of the dog is.", "YTA. Why do you hate dogs", "I get being irritated but I honestly can't imagine cursing at a stranger who's minding their own business like this. It was completely unnecessary and based on an assumption. And while most service dogs are trained very well, some who are use to staying home to care for their owners (due to things like agoraphobia/being home bound) or who haven't had their training kept up regularly will behave like this. Ideally service dogs are well trained and behave perfectly in public. Realistically, not all service dogs are perfect, not all owners can afford to keep their dogs trained/have the energy to keep up with their dogs training, and not all service dogs are use to every situation.

Definitely not a real service animal, and *even* of it was, it should be re-evaluated. \n\nAnd yes actually. Most people have a decent idea of what a fucking service animal looks like: a well behaved dog that does NOT leave its handlers side, that does NOT bark needlessly and DEFINITELY does not lunge at people. Source: I work in a grocery store and have a brain. If you really think people with service dogs are some kind of unspeakable rarity, think again.", "If the service animal has regressed in its (lifelong and extremely rigorous) training, it needs to be re-evaluated. Was getting angry the absolute right thing to do? No. But neither is faking your dog's Service status. It should be a crime to do that and to sell vests claiming the wearer is certified. If I had a dime for every time I wished I could tell off a fake service dog owner, I could quit my job. And yes, it's VERY easy to tell the difference.", "Your edit is fucking absurd.", "Fake service dogs are becoming a massive problem. It is not hard to tell when a dog is working. This one either was and it's owner was NOT addressing the alert or it wasn't a service dog. There are reasons untrained dogs aren't allowed inside nearly all businesses.", "Yes they can. That blind woman's dog was either completely uncertified or in serious need of re-evaluation. That should NEVER EVER happen.", "We now have registration for service dogs in NZ. It comes with a special tag, and was set up so people running emergency shelters would immediately know which dogs absolutely could not be separated from their person. (It became a priority after someone seeking shelter after a flood was separated from their service dog.)\n\nThe additional cost was minimal. There are only a few recognised service dog organisations so they just had to set up a way to connect with the local governments which already register all dogs.", "Which is why OP asked if there was a medical emergency bc that's what a real service dog would be barking for.  Otherwise they are absolutely trained to be quiet", "Ugh, I was in Malibu the other day, and this woman legitimately got into a fight with me because she was trying to prove her german shepard was a legitimate service animal. The dog was growling at people and lunging! \n\nAlso, it was an un-neutered male. It's impossible to have a service animal that's not fixed.", "I actually disagree with this. Service dogs trained in medical alert usually alert to sudden changes or a certain range of abnormality. The whole point is to alert before an episode occurs and make the owner aware that they may need to begin intervention or harm reducing steps. If the woman had diabetes for example, she may continue her shopping because she\u2019s almost done and has snacks in her purse or a meal planned after her errand is over. \n\nDogs can make mistakes and alert at incorrect times and in America at least, service dogs in training have public access rights. Many people opt to train alerts to be physical rather than verbal but with smaller dogs a verbal cue may be more effective. I have no opinion on this dog in particular because I wasn\u2019t there but generally the biggest give away to a fake is if they do not regularly check on their handler. Service Dogs will interact with their environment and smell or even walk a couple steps away from a handler but they will be constantly turning to look at their handler and paying attention to any movement or noise they make. \n\nI just want to correct a misconception as it\u2019s already very difficult for people with invisible illnesses and I\u2019ve previously looked into getting a service dog for myself so I\u2019m pretty familiar with the jobs they do and how they do them.\n\nETA: if the dog is meant to alert to allergens it could be alerting to something in the isle. Many allergies are comorbid (sp?) with one another so a dog that\u2019s trained to detect severe allergens will likely also be trained alert to other potentially less serious allergens. Also realistically if you have an allergy or other food related medical condition you still have to get groceries and potentially pass the packaged form of your medical trigger. Your dog is meant to detect very small amounts of that food/ingredient so a grocery store isle is potentially gonna make them alert especially if it\u2019s not heavily packaged.\n\nBasically just because the lady is not actively in anaphylactic shock doesn\u2019t mean that her dog isn\u2019t hypothetically alerting to a serious allergen in her proximity.", "And those fake service dogs have been known to act aggressively to real service dogs when they cross paths. This can cause serious problems for the service dog and handler beyond the incident itself.", "It doesn't have to be a medical emergency though. Service dogs bark alert for allergens, potential dangers, triggers for their owner, a high blood sugar, and on and on and on. None of those are a medical emergency.", "I was in the mall and the new trend is to get your dog a \u201cservice dog in training\u201d vest in order to excuse its behaviour. Saw a lady walking a basset hound with this vest. She kept saying \u201cnose!\u201d and tugging his leash. Like, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s a Basset. I\u2019ve owned them. You are not going to train one NOT to sniff the ground. It\u2019s literally why they exist.", "The true cost of a service dog IS the training. It takes hours of training not just the dog but the handler and that training takes place over the course of months and is often ongoing throughout the dog's service to one extent or another. Many breeders who produce service dogs do fundraisers for their handler/dog teams to help defray the costs but yes, it's very expensive. \n\nSteadfast Service Dogs is a great example of ethical breeders of quality service dogs. One of the owners is also a master trainer and these people travel all over the country to train the dogs they've placed and their handlers. They also train on site at their home. They do all they can do gather donations to defray the costs (and yeah, they're my favorite charity). If the cost really concerns you, look them up. You can donate the Steadfast directly or pick a team to help sponsor.", "It would require rewriting the ADA.  Would you like to present an ID to enter the grocery store?  That is what you are proposing, otherwise.  The ADA currently doesn\u2019t allow removing rights from disabled people, that non disabled people have.  So if non spdiszbled people don\u2019t need an ID to shop, neither do disabled people. No, it wouldn\u2019t involve giving the dog the ID, that wouldn\u2019t work. Only the handler has rights. The dog doesn\u2019t. If the dog was listed as an SD, that would let ANYONE bring it to a store.  Has to be the handler\u2019s ID.", "It\u2019s widely accepted in service dog communities that bark alerts are disruptive, and should be avoided unless used in an emergency. Everything you listed can and should be trained with silent markers such as pawing, sitting, blocking, and on and on and on.", "Luckily service animals in training are NOT covered under ADA protection- most stores just don\u2019t know that.\n\nI learned ALL the rules, in self defense. I kick fake service dogs out every week", "Not really honestly. Well, if it\u2019s communal and not on a plate. Celiac can be nasty. It\u2019s an autoimmune disease that attacks the lower intestine. Would you like to shit blood? I certainly would not. It can cause cancer among a host of other horribly painfully times. Pretty awesome reason to me.", "Can I get a service dog that will alert me to presence of ice cream nearby"]}
