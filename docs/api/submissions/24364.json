Fake service dogs cause issues for those that actually need a service animal.", "Every ACTUAL service dog I've ever come across has been extremely well trained and would never bark unless it was necessary.

I don't know, I think ESH.", "I have no idea - it somewhat depends on whether she had a legit service dog or not. Signs point to \"no,\" and I do find fake service dogs annoying. But even if that was the case, what were you expecting to happen?\n\nIf she has a legit service dog, then yeah, she's going to be mad if a stranger gets in her business and swears at her. If it was a fake service dog, then of course she's going to get defensive if a stranger gets in her business and swears at her. Either way, confronting her in a grocery store probably wouldn't accomplish much but make both of your days worse.\n\nSo I'm not inclined to say that you're the asshole here, but you probably would have had a better day if you silently judged her and then moved on with your life.", "ESH. People with fake service dogs are assholes and people who cuss out strangers are also assholes. (IF the service dog was fake, anyway, which there's almost no way of knowing)", "NTA", "Ohh no no no. You don't do that. YTA. Big time. It's not your place to assume that the service dog is fake.

Get off your high horse and move along.", "YTA. \n\nA service dog alerting is not just about a medical emergency. It can be to inform the owner about a danger, a change in heart rate, a trigger or stressor in the area, a drop or rise in blood sugar and a host of other things. Some allergen service dogs alert for allergens in the area. \n\nYou made an assumption and then rudely questioned her. You have no business or right to do so.", "Yes, YTA. I understand your frustration if you're not a dog person and honestly it's entirely possible that it wasn't an actual trained service animal. But you don't know that for sure. It wouldn't have been that hard to just move along. You didn't accomplish anything.", "YTA. Unless you have proof, accusing someone to have a fake service dog is completely out of line.", "[deleted]", "YTA and I say that as a service dog handler. If you suspect a dog is misbehaving then you need to approach the manager of the store who is the only person who can make the call on what to do about it.\n\nIt\u2019s true that pet owners tend to be entitled assholes who think their dogs are welcome everywhere. However most people wouldn\u2019t know what a tasking service dog looks like.\n\nBarking to alert is allowed by the ADA. It\u2019s possible the dog was alerting to its handler and they just didn\u2019t want to tell you. Because it\u2019s none of your business. \n\nI don\u2019t like pets where they don\u2019t belong either.

You still were needlessly aggressive.\n\nBut if it was a real service dog, the barking is what is PREVENTING the medical emergency. Barking signals the human part of the service animal pairing to take care of their medical condition BEFORE it causes an emergency", "YTA\n\nService dogs have all kinds of roles.  My friend has a hearing dog that tips and licks/ paws her to alert her to noise and people nearby.  The dog may have been alerting the owner to something legitimate, but that wasn\u2019t a \u201cmedical emergency.  It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a \u201cf-cking fake service dog\u201d just because there isn\u2019t an immediate medical emergency, and it\u2019s not your place to insert yourself or tell someone to leave.", "YTA, and in a huge way. When when you confronted them, it sounds like they replied civilly, and you then flew off the handle. It seems you went into the encounter with a negative attitude, already assuming it was a fake service dog, and looking to validate your feelings and find an excuse to chew them out.", "YTA, asked a question clearly in bad faith as a pre-emptive ploy to verbally abuse them.\n\nIf you're going to be an asshole why not skip the pre-amble.", "Yes, YTA.

It's likely that it was a legit service dog, meaning she needed it and also should never have to prove that to you.", "Yes, OP....YTA. Yes, it's entirely possible that she has a fake service dog. It's none of your business to call her on it. It's on the store to ask her about it, which if I'm not mistaken they aren't allowed to do. You could have just gone to a different aisle to avoid her.", "YTA for sure. You don\u2019t know what that dog is for, and you have no right to that information. You were super rude.

Fake service dog or real service dog, is it genuinely affecting you that much?\n4. **Some service dogs are trained to bark in certain scenarios**\n5. Stop berating people for using resources for support", "YTA because there are a lot of reasons between fake service dog and dog alerting here that could be going on. The dog could be in training still, the dog could be alerting but the issue may not be something that results in the need for outside help or medical attention, etc. \n\nYes \u201cservice dog\u201d has gotten abused a lot in recent times but as a fellow patron you don\u2019t really have any place to say anything unless the dog is seriously causing a problem that could result in injury to someone. \n\nI agree it seems suspicious that a service dog would be barking like that but you don\u2019t know what the purpose of the dog is.", "YTA. Why do you hate dogs", "I get being irritated but I honestly can't imagine cursing at a stranger who's minding their own business like this. It was completely unnecessary and based on an assumption. And while most service dogs are trained very well, some who are use to staying home to care for their owners (due to things like agoraphobia/being home bound) or who haven't had their training kept up regularly will behave like this. Ideally service dogs are well trained and behave perfectly in public. Realistically, not all service dogs are perfect, not all owners can afford to keep their dogs trained/have the energy to keep up with their dogs training, and not all service dogs are use to every situation.

It comes with a special tag, and was set up so people running emergency shelters would immediately know which dogs absolutely could not be separated from their person.

There are only a few recognised service dog organisations so they just had to set up a way to connect with the local governments which already register all dogs.", "Which is why OP asked if there was a medical emergency bc that's what a real service dog would be barking for.

Service dogs trained in medical alert usually alert to sudden changes or a certain range of abnormality. The whole point is to alert before an episode occurs and make the owner aware that they may need to begin intervention or harm reducing steps. If the woman had diabetes for example, she may continue her shopping because she\u2019s almost done and has snacks in her purse or a meal planned after her errand is over. \n\nDogs can make mistakes and alert at incorrect times and in America at least, service dogs in training have public access rights. Many people opt to train alerts to be physical rather than verbal but with smaller dogs a verbal cue may be more effective. I have no opinion on this dog in particular because I wasn\u2019t there but generally the biggest give away to a fake is if they do not regularly check on their handler. Service Dogs will interact with their environment and smell or even walk a couple steps away from a handler but they will be constantly turning to look at their handler and paying attention to any movement or noise they make. \n\nI just want to correct a misconception as it\u2019s already very difficult for people with invisible illnesses and I\u2019ve previously looked into getting a service dog for myself so I\u2019m pretty familiar with the jobs they do and how they do them.\n\nETA: if the dog is meant to alert to allergens it could be alerting to something in the isle. Many allergies are comorbid (sp?) with one another so a dog that\u2019s trained to detect severe allergens will likely also be trained alert to other potentially less serious allergens. Also realistically if you have an allergy or other food related medical condition you still have to get groceries and potentially pass the packaged form of your medical trigger. Your dog is meant to detect very small amounts of that food/ingredient so a grocery store isle is potentially gonna make them alert especially if it\u2019s not heavily packaged.\n\nBasically just because the lady is not actively in anaphylactic shock doesn\u2019t mean that her dog isn\u2019t hypothetically alerting to a serious allergen in her proximity.", "And those fake service dogs have been known to act aggressively to real service dogs when they cross paths.

It takes hours of training not just the dog but the handler and that training takes place over the course of months and is often ongoing throughout the dog's service to one extent or another.

One of the owners is also a master trainer and these people travel all over the country to train the dogs they've placed and their handlers. They also train on site at their home.

Most corporations are just too afraid to ask because of public backlash from 1% of the population.", "I don't think people would support the increase in taxes required to pay for enough trained testing facilities for every disabled person to have a local facility equipped to simulate all the possibilities to see if a dog will display any problematic behaviors, plus the staff to run those facilities.", "A tag for the dog won\u2019t work.  No strangers are going to touch my dog.  It won\u2019t show, he is too furry.  You can\u2019t even see his collar.  An ID for the dog I carry, well that is pointless.  It would be too easy to fake, and if the human weren\u2019t on it, anyone could bring the dog.  \n\nSince the dog has zero rights under ADA, it would require rewriting it. A *disabled handler* has the right to bring their service dog with them.  So any ID would be the humans.  \n\nTesting the dogs would be. Billion dollar new federal department. Training doctors to write the prescriptions to qualify people. Paying for people to see said doctors, trans porting people to testing sites, paying testers,\u2018paying to develop the tests, for the IDs, and then the PR campaign to teach people what these new IDs look like. And figuring out how to tell them apart from the fakes that will pop up immediately. They would be easier to make than fake licenses kids use for alcohol.  \n\nOr, businesses could just ask the questions and kick out dogs who misbehave. Places that do this, having actually read the laws, tend to not have trouble.", "It seems far easier and cheaper to have a fairly standard test setup, than to have *every* store employee trained in full ADA-compliancy AND monitoring misbehaving dogs while there is nothing disincentivizing abusers.", "I would definitely agree with that list of dogs! My own Assistance Dog is a Standard Poodle and he was a *literal dream* to go through the training process with.", "To be fair, though, a cane can\u2019t bite someone and wheelchairs don\u2019t urinate on the floor. Asking someone to remove their prosthesis to prove an amputation is a world apart from asking for service animal documentation. Furthermore, we don\u2019t just allow people to park in handicap spots without a placard- there\u2019s necessary documentation required for that accommodation so that it isn\u2019t abused by the public. Do some people fake it or steal the sign from a dead relative? Unfortunately, yes. Still, it\u2019s a stopgap nonetheless. If things continue as they are, I think that we will likely be seeing lawsuits and increased discrimination against service dogs and their handlers.", "Perfect response", "I think people over complicate this issue on several fronts.\n\nYes, the first order of business is for shops and such to ask the correct questions and kick out non services dogs. They are allowed to ask certain questions and are within the rights to do so. \n\nOther places are able to implement tags/vests for actual services animals with no issues or additional costs to their handlers.  However the ada wording would have to be changed first. A service dog has already been through quite a bit of training, that isn't difficult to prove. Anyone who needs one already has a diagnosis so not sure why that would be an issue. Not like you can fake a seizure, low vision, low blood sugar or the like. If your dog is tasked to get your medicine during a medical episode, that's pretty simple to show. I don't see why licensing the dog as a service dog is any different than me getting the regular  licensing and tags my dog requires", "And if you ask the community, they will tell you not to use a bark as a task.  I have a service dog, been involved int he discussions for years.  It\u2019s a mistake, if only because it limits your public access.  Why teach your dog, your needed medical equipment for which you will have continual access trouble, to so something GUARANTEED to make that issue worse?", "When I realized my Cav was a natural for what I needed, I shaped his behaviors and taught him actual tasks. He still needed a lot of training, but public access was pretty easy.  He is just mellow, and one of his goals in life is to watch me, so telling him watch me, not that, when even he gets distracted, and he will go, \u201coh, yeah, right. I can do that\u201d. He respond easily to positive commands and treats, so ignoring food in stores and looking at me was easy to teach.  Ignoring fabric and notions in the cloth store was a bigger challenge, that I simply don\u2019t understand! But, he got to decide what is harder for him to do and I just had to figure out how to help him learn.", "Also, if businesses would routinely ask the questions and kick out the AHs, and if people would shame friends and relatives who they know are faking, the problem would dissipate.  Peer pressure does work.  That means there would be fewer misbehaving in stores for them to have to deal with.", "Regardless, Assistance Dogs are legally protected as medical equipment. They\u2019re viewed no differently legally than a mobility aid would be. \n\nWould you want to be asked for identity documents every single time you enter a public space? Keep in mind, many of us already experience discrimination.\n\nLike many things, they could also be faked. \n\nA trained Assistance Dog isn\u2019t going to bite anyone or urinate on the floor. Many have actual urination cues. If you say \u201cBe quick,\u201d to my dog, he will squat and urinate there and then. \n\nThere are disgusting people out there who pretend their dogs are Assistance Dogs, and they really do make everyone\u2019s life hell, but our legal protections shouldn\u2019t change because of those people.\n\nI would lean towards there being more thorough training in businesses, especially in terms of what can be asked and when Assistance Dogs (or those posing as them) can be removed.", "Thank you!  You just improved this thread dramatically!", "You would have to have standardized paperwork from doctors saying you qualified, it\u2019s not like everyone disabled has a paper saying they are.  Many have nothing, actually. I certainly don\u2019t, for any of my disabilities. Vast numbers of doctors simply won\u2019t fill out paperwork like this. They would need training. I know it sounds crazy.  Fact of life. \n\nIn the US, owners are allowed to train their own dogs.  Testing is expensive. Many handlers wouldn\u2019t be able to get to a testing site. Many can\u2019t drive, don\u2019t have cars.  Who would set up the tests? What would they include?  Who would pay? Do you know why we didn\u2019t have them to begin with?  \n\nAgain, are we going to require EVERYONE to provide an ID to go to stores?  Are you willing to say \u201cdisabled people are second class citizens and need an ID to go to stores?  That is what this would require.", "Are we talking about the dog in OP\u2019s scenario, or my own dog?\n\nI would agree a dog barking incessantly is a nuisance. \n\nBut, if my Assistance Dog jumping up at me as part of a distraction task is enough to cause you a nuisance, I think that\u2019s more of a you issue than a him issue. It must be really nice to be able to exist without need for distractions like that, but we don\u2019t all have that privilege.\n\nAn Assistance Dog performing the tasks they\u2019re trained to perform is not being a nuisance, they\u2019re enabling someone to live as normal of a life as they can.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth considering the actual legalities of what you\u2019re suggesting.", "I'm still unclear about what you think those questions would accomplish though?", "I've had a service dog who was trained privately and am hoping to be able to get one again. \n\nI would have exactly zero issue with my service dog being required to have an official license or tag or needing to show a card of some sort. None. I would actually welcome it. \n\nIf it keeps people from taking advantage of the situation, keeps unruly fake service dogs out of stores and goes back to service dogs being treated with the respect they deserve and keeps shady companies and people from selling fake vests and certificates. All for it. \n\nWhen i had my service dog it was well before the influx of fake ones and esa dogs everywhere and people took it seriously.  My dog was treated kindly and people understood they couldn't pet or play with her. Hotels and restaurants and those around me didn't give me issue.  I see how even legitimate service dogs are treated, people trying to pet them or complaining that they are there and it's upsetting.  \n\nYou went immediately back to overcomplicating the issue but we do that well here i guess.", "Any dog"]}
