Getting off the bus that was taking both my friend and I to the mall and instead walking to my house after waiting almost an hour for her at the bus stop  2.

Making you wait over an hour with no communication sounds pretty rude. But also wondering why you didn't attempt any communication, texting to ask if something had come up, etc.? As for bringing someone else along, I don't like it when people surprise me with extras when I assume we're doing something one-on-one, but that's not necessarily a jerk move unless the friend intentionally led you to believe it'd be just the two of you. Walking away without a word instead of asking for an explanation comes across as kinda immature.", "ESH. Her delay was beyond rude but it was bold of you to assume she asked you out on a date when absolutely nothing suggests she did.", "Saying date could just be a way of saying a get together. I use that sometimes. Kinda like how I call my girl friends \u201cgirlfriends\u201d. They call me that too.", "\u201cYeah she made you wait an hour but\u2014\u201c\n\nBut nothing, she shouldn\u2019t expect a single thing from Op after making someone wait an hour. If she had been texting updates, then it\u2019s a different story. \n\nThe same people would say you suck if you had just gone home. \u201cwHY dIdNt yOu tELl yOuR fRieNd yoU WEnT hOmE?\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA and she's evidently got a new friend.  Keep it moving.", "NTA", "She made you wait an hour with no contact and then brought a random without telling you she\u2019s the toxic one holy.NTA", "ESH. I could be wrong, but this comes off more as you being petty because it wasn\u2019t a date like you thought. She absolutely shouldn\u2019t of kept you waiting for an hour without updating you if she was running behind. You were on the bus however when she got there. At that point it wouldn\u2019t have cost any more time and you could\u2019ve told her you were unhappy.", "INFO: Was this other person actually with your friend? Or just getting on the bus at the same time?", "NTA.  Making OP wait an hour is what most people would call rude.", "She had somebody with her because she assumed you wouldn\u2019t have waited that long.", "one hour is way too much. I would have waited 15 minutes at most", "NTA I'd text her back and say we'll tou were an hour later than you said 3 buses past me while I have been waiting which I think is a lot ruder not to mention not telling me you were bringing someone else as well", "NTA. Text her back: I'm sorry but I'm not your friend. If I was you would have been here when you said you would and not left me waiting for over an hour. I'm blocking and deleting you.\n\nThen block her number. Don't engage with people like that. They're not worth it.", "Are you upset that she made you wait an hour, or are you upset that there was another person with her at your non-date \u201cdate\u201d?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the issue was here.", "NTA", "And you didn't even get any nachos", "I never said it was a romantic date lol", "\ud83d\ude02excellent reference! That one was nuts\u2026I definitely would have eaten them (if I\u2019d not got bored of waiting that long!)", "Yeah I\u2019m going with YTA cause you are clearly leaving out details to be the Victim. The title calls it a date but it was clearly not a date and I think your mad about that. You wouldn\u2019t of brought up the friend otherwise since it doesn\u2019t add anything to the story.", "ESH. she is obviously an AH for leaving you to wait for an hour without any kind of communication, but outside of that I don't understand why you care if she invited someone else as well.\n\nYour wording makes it seem like you expected this to be a date-date instead of friends hanging out. Usually if someone else is being included in plans you should let people know beforehand, but unless this other individual is someone you knowingly have an issue with, there's no reason be so concerned if they are there or not.", "Bless you for this", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019d have never waited that long.", "Not even for $35 worth of nachos?", "Fair question. I could have put a good dent in them and still be gone before an hour was up."]}
