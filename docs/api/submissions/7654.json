Getting off the bus that was taking both my friend and I to the mall and instead walking to my house after waiting almost an hour for her at the bus stop  2. I could've forgive her for being late and maybe getting mad at the fact that she brought someone else without telling me was an overreaction..\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n# [Check out our upcoming Reddit Talk With John Hodgman on January 18th @ 7pm EST](https://redd.it/109b8y5)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Making you wait over an hour with no communication sounds pretty rude. But also wondering why you didn't attempt any communication, texting to ask if something had come up, etc.? As for bringing someone else along, I don't like it when people surprise me with extras when I assume we're doing something one-on-one, but that's not necessarily a jerk move unless the friend intentionally led you to believe it'd be just the two of you. Walking away without a word instead of asking for an explanation comes across as kinda immature.", "ESH. Her delay was beyond rude but it was bold of you to assume she asked you out on a date when absolutely nothing suggests she did.", "Saying date could just be a way of saying a get together. I use that sometimes. Kinda like how I call my girl friends \u201cgirlfriends\u201d. They call me that too."]}
