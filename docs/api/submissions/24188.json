He was very smart about understanding that medical advice should come from a person's physician not family member. \n\nYour MIL is doing harm by offering medical advice outside of the doctor patient relationship to a person she knows will do the exact opposite of what she recommends. What your mother-in-law is doing is unprofessional and she should stop this behavior. However, considering the very toxic nature of their relationship it is very likely that she will continue no matter who attempts to intervene. Please understand what she is doing is part of the toxic relationship. \n\nNo matter how great a doctor, they should not be treating their family members. Period. \n\nPlease encourage your wife to listen to the advise of her physicians and support her.", "This is a relationship problem\n\nWith a simple solution.  MIL stop giving advice thats not warranted\n\nIs she the only medical professional in your region?", "NAH. Your MIL may be a doctor but she is not your wife\u2019s doctor. The MIL making suggestions *feels* to your wife like her mother dictating orders. Get you wife to her own physician or a specialist. And don\u2019t ask the MIL for referrals.", "YTA . I believe your intentions are altruistic but there's still a toxic Mom/Daughter dynamic at play here and you don't seem to recognize this, so by siding with your MIL you're making the situation worse.\n\nYou'd be a better help by pointing out to this reality to your MIL and taking your Wife to Doctor she can trust.", "I'm hesitant to leave any verdict, so I'll go with NAH except MIL. \n\nThat said, you know wife's relationship with MIL is toxic. You know there are other doctors she could consult. You know that MIL gives advice as a way to meddle. \n\nMIL may be a doctor, but she isn't your wife's doctor, and she isn't necessarily correct. She feels entitled to render her opinion even when it's plainly inappropriate and harmful and she should STFU. If MIL's therapy had sunk in, maybe she'd realize that her daughter was looking for empathy and validation that she's struggling, not orders. \n\nAnyone with a chronic illness will tell you that there is an endless parade of (well intentioned, and not so well intentioned) unsolicited advice that WILL be given to you. It's exhausting, unproductive, and sometimes outright infuriating. It coming from someone she has a baseline troubled relationship with, and you reinforcing that she really should listen to mommy, is probably unimaginably grating to your wife. \n\nTell wife you will support her if she tells mom to STFU on medical advice, or if she decides to go LC again. If wife isn't in therapy, is this something she would consider? Offer/keep offering your support if she wants it for appointments and other matters. Ask HER if there's something her doctors have advised that you could help with. \n\nAnd when she reaches out for empathy, don't tell her to stop eating chocolate or whatever the hell for god's sake.", "YTA\n\nI think you have this wrong. Your wife isn't refusing to listen to medical advice, she is refusing to follow medical advice from her mother. Your MIL needs to stop giving advice, and you should tell your MIL that her advice is negatively impacting her daughter given their history because she might not even know. Seek medical opinions that aren't from within the family. That'd be the best way to validate MILs input rather than just taking what MIL says at face value because your wife clearly isn't interested in that.", "Your MIL should stay out of your wife's medical issues. She probably is aware of how your wife reacts to any recommendations she makes, so I guess she is aware of what happens if she gives advice. She is actively harming her daughter! Your MIL just enjoys being right and playing one-upmanship with her. Don't support her in this.\n\nYou are harming your wife, as well, if you side with your MIL. \n\nAlso, you are endangering your marriage, and the trust your wife has in you. Please don't do that either. Suggest to your wife to discuss these topics with her doctor. They will be able to give her advice which she feels she can trust and accept.\n\nYour wife is ill, she needs your full support, and that also means supporting her against her mother if your wife so wishes.\n\nI had pretty much the same relationship with my mother. If my husband had sided with her like that, I would have been really hurt, mad and dissapointed in him. And felt left alone.\n\nYWBTA if you continue siding with your MIL, regardless of her being right about some things.", "NTA but your wife needs therapy/counseling now. Just to spite her mother, she seems to be willing to die. This isn't normal and she needs help.", "I'll go with a SOFT esh. It's great that your MIL has undergone therapy/seeking ways to improve herself. And yes with being a doctor, she COULD have good advice to give to your wife. But she Is NOT your wife's doctor, and your wife should ONLY be following the advice/treatment given by her doctor. So MIL needs to drop the medical advice.\n\nHowever your wife sounds like she hasn't recovered at ALL from her childhood, and needs to do so. She needs to seek therapy or some other form of help to address her mental problems. She's causing harm to HERSELF by choosing to behave how she is, which is dangerous. \n\nAnd you as her husband need to back up your wife. She probably feels like shit since she's doing actions to physically harm herself (to spite her mom), as well as feeling abandoned and/or betrayed since you didn't take her side. Affirm that you as her husband will always want what is best for her health and help encourage her to find peace with her issues.", "NTA but the answer here is really that your wife needs to see a different doctor, and follow THEIR recommendations. Unfortunately due to their past, even well-informed guidance from your MIL will be counterproductive for your wife. \n\nI think your wife could benefit from some therapy. It isn't fair for her to turn on you for wanting her to seriously consider legitimate medical advice, or for being alarmed that she would self-sabotage just to prove a point. It's very self-defeatist of her and negatively impacting her health. \n\nBut ultimately, lots of people don't have a doctor for a mother and an artifact of their relationship is that your wife doesn't or can't take advice from her mother.", "NTA. Your wife needs a to either get a therapist or find a new and better one. \"Listening to her is damaging to my mental health\", well doing the opposite like an obstinate child is damaging her physical health.\n\nIt would be bad enough if she just ignored her mother but to go to an extreme?", "NTA. Just as your MIL went to therapy to become better, I think your wife should also go to therapy. You don't make a statement by destroying your own health; it may feel good for a short time, but in the long run, she will regret her decisions.", "NTA. Sounds like your wife now needs some therapy/personal growth time. Her spite doing the opposite of whatever her mom says is pretty nuts. If your MIL said not to smoke cigarettes would she start smoking?", "NTA. She's being childish about this. Wearing different colours is one thing, but doing things detrimental to her health is immature and negligent.", "NTA. I think you are truly coming from a good place. Have you taken your wife to a completely different doctor? Maybe hearing the same advice from an unrelated third party would give her some sort of perspective. \n\nIt also seems like your wife needs some sort of therapy as well. Her going to the extreme is not healthy. Like if your MIL were to say hey don't jump into this ditch, would she jump?", "NTA Your wife will spite the nose on her face. FWIW An acquaintance of mine did similar. She died of gangrene by refusing to see a doctor after her mother suggested it.  You are not at fault for not understanding ingrained oppositional behavior.  I would recommend a therapist to help you learn how to go forward without damaging your relationship with your wife.", "Ignore the people voting Y.T.A.  You only have concern for your wife's health and she is purposefully making herself feel worse by ignoring medical advice.  Google is our friend, and there's no reason that she couldn't have done a quick search to see if MIL is being honest or being an AH.  Also, she presumably has her own doctor that she could ask these questions as well.  Your wife needs therapy bigtime if she continues to actually make herself feel worse in order to spite mama.

Yet you're doing it anyway.\n\n> AITA for telling my wife she should listen to medical advice for her own health?\n\nShe should listen to medical advice.  That advice needs to come from somebody other than your MIL, both for practical (wife won't listen to mom) and ethical (don't doctor your own family) reasons.\n\nLet me put it to you this way.\n\nSay when you grew up, your father beat you.  Dropped something?  Back of the hand across the face.  Broke something?  Whipped with a belt.  Forgot to call him 'sir?' Well, he keeps a paddle handy for those infractions.\n\nSo you move out, after a life of this.

I guess?\n\nFrom what you said, it sounds like your MIL is genuinely trying to be helpful, so she's not the AH.

And you want what's best for your wife, and are telling her to stop doing something that is making her condition worse, again not the AH.\n\nTwo important pieces of advice - First, considering the nature of their relationship, and the fact that you know your wife won't listen, you need to take her to a relevant specialist (if you haven't already) and ask their advice on any dietary modifications.

The MIL didn't tell her to do anything, she didn't diagnose anything. She simply continued on the conversation the wife started in a very normal and expected way.

Jeez-  you would think she had enough self preservation instinct to blow off her moms suggestions rather than double-down on doing the opposite.", "Based on what your wife lived through (even though MIL has went to therapy) your wife will react the opposite just to take control.

Tell MIL to not give any medical advice even if it will help. I\u2019m not saying the mother is wrong but it sounds like the wife doesn\u2019t care. You need to be silent during this or anything that the MIL says. You can bring up research that you found or ask her to ask the doctor about things you see or she is having problems with.\n\nWhy did reconnect? Was the MIL pushing and daughter felt obligated? Was it due to pressure from others? Was it because the daughter felt like she should on her own? These questions have a big impact on how the wife takes gifts, advice or other actions. The dress could be a trigger due to the mother forcing her to wet certain colors or cloths in childhood.", "I'd stay out of it.

And the original post is a perfect example of one reason why it's a bad idea. \n\nLicenced professionals have an extra duty of care when acting and the MIL is potentially breaking her electrical obligations. Regardless, her actions are negatively impacting her daughter because of their past  relationship. As a licensed professional she needs to stop.

MIL doesn't have access (or shouldn't) to her daughter's full medical records. She has no idea what exams or labs have been run, the results of said tests.

I had a Vitamin D deficiency and now have to take a daily vitamin supplement. So if MIL told me I should cut down on foods that contain Vitamin D, that would be bad medical advice. Calcium is needed to aid absobrtion of Vitamin D. So MIL telling me to cut out dairy would be bad.\n\nAt the same time I have a medication that can't be taken at the same time as Vitamin D. Have to be at least 4 hours apart. I've had medication that couldn't be taken within 4 hours of eating dairy. I've been on 2 medications that need to be taken an hour before eating but couldn't be taken at the same time. I was on another medication that can cause a folate deficiency. So I had to take a folic acid supplement. \n\nMy husband was on Warfarin for a year. Vitamin K counteracts Warfarin. So he wasn't supposed to eat more than 1/2 cup a day of foods high in Vitamin K. He could eat more than than that but it then had to be the same amount on the same day EVERT week. So if he ate 2 cups of Vitamin K rich foods on Wednesday then he needed to eat 2 cups EVERY Wednesday. So telling someone to add or decrease certain nutrients/food IS actual medical advice.", "Sure, it can be. It's medicine-adjacent, at least. It's also a pretty normal thing for one human being to say to another; we constantly give each other food advice.\n\nOP's wife's reaction worries me.
