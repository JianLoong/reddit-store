Her parents both own vehicles and are often home but refuse to drive her places, or if they do, they often complain.\n\nA couple of days ago Sara wanted to go to store (As did I), we agreed to go together, and she asked for a ride home. (She often asks me for rides) Turns out the day we went was a massive snow storm. The beginning of the day was fine, but once the snow picked up she kept insisting that everything \"was fine\" when I was worried about the weather. I felt pressured to drive her home, as she had 'remembered' to send me the 10$ for driving her. Well, It was horrible to drive in and I was legitimately terrified that I wouldn't make it home after driving her, I briefly said \"maybe we should go to Tom's place (My bf who lives close), this is too dangerous....\" to which she replied \"I'm sure it's fine\" and insisted I drive her home. Well, it wasn't, once I got to her place, I knew I wouldn't be able to make it home and stayed the night. The drive to her place from where we were takes about 30 minutes, it took us about 1.5 hours to get to her place in that storm...\n\nNow: We have an event coming up this weekend. (Where Sara, Tom,  our friend Emma and I are all going) She asked me to pick her up and drop her off from a local uni that is on the way of my drive there. I told Sara I would pick her up from the college, but not drop her off as it was going to snow again and this time, if the weather was bad I was going to stay at Tom's place. She asked again, and I told her I can't, she then claimed our friend Emma would. I reminded her that she shouldn't decide on someone's behalf and ask Emma first. \n\nWell, Emma said no, so she started complaining that her parents would only pick her up from the uni. She insisted that she would not bus there, as it was too complicated. She considered an uber momentarily, only to ask Emma and I if either of us can drop her off somewhere closer but not  the uni. Neither of us agreed. She said she didn't feel safe \"bussing in bad weather\", I argued back that bussing is safer than driving. Then she started saying that she was stressed as her parents were yelling and didn't want to pick her up (even though they both had the day off) Emma told Sara that she could sleep over at her house if anything, to which Sara refused insisting she has school the next day and that \"her parents would just have to pick her up\".\n\nThe problem is, she always expects me to pick her up from the local uni if we're hanging out, or even drop her home. However, she's a grown adult and she needs to solve her own problems. There's so many more stories that have happened from me refusing to say no and driving her where she needs to go...\n\nAITA for putting my foot down and insisting she sort it out herself?", "created_utc": 1674959992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nwsjo/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_friend_to_teach_her/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Emergency calls for busted water pipes after business hours happens sometimes and he does go out to work on them. One night at midnight he got a call, a hellacious snowstorm had hit West Texas and many motorists were stuck in the snow, my brother's work phone is listed in the water district for emergencies. My brother received so many calls and he had to explain over and over that he only fixes broken water pipes in emergencies.  This one woman at midnight still pleaded for help, she had two kids with her and they were freezing. My brother decided to head out to help, also took food and blankets with his 4-wheel drive truck. He could only drive at a crawl, the road was covered with snow to the point he couldn't tell where the road was and wound up slipping into a ditch, he tried driving backwards but couldn't get out of the ditch, he tried digging snow away from the truck but nothing helped. At 2:00 am he called a friend to come in his tractor to pull him out, friend said he would come in his 4-wheel drive truck, my brother told him that was what he was driving and he still got stuck. At 5:00 am he saw headlights coming and it was his friend coming in his tractor to pull him out, his friend did head out in his truck but also got stuck in the snow and walked back to his place to get the tractor. My brother went back home after being pulled out by his friend. He has no idea what happened to the woman and her two kids, while waiting for help himself he received a call from the woman's Uncle but my brother told him he was stuck himself and unable to help her. Woman's Uncle told my brother he had a 4-wheel drive truck and would drive from Dallas to help his niece, my brother told him he had a 4-wheel truck and he still got stuck.\n\nMy brother told me this story two weeks ago and I am still upset thinking about how my brother put his life in jeopardy,  he will always be one to help others in need, I just asked him to be more careful about taking risks weather related.
