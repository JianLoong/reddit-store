Another thing, he offered to come to my home. When I found out I was pregnant I\u2019d offered to stay, I didn\u2019t even bring up or mention moving and told him we\u2019d look into permanent housing instead of our current set up and he said we\u2019d go back to my home**\n\n**Some of these comments are giving me a stress headache, I\u2019m reading them but the most common one is that I\u2019m dragging him away so obviously I\u2019ll be speaking to him about that, I\u2019ll tell him I will come if they can suck up me bring a veggie dish, next time they want to jab at me I will be making a comment back as apparently it\u2019s something to suck up!

If I had to do it over again I wouldn't.\n\nYou sat through a dinner with people making fun of you and making you feel unwelcome. That's a lot worse than what I went through.

I get not wanting/being able to cook more food to accommodate, but not letting you bring anything yourself is needlessly cruel. To anyone saying \"pick a side dish and suck it up\" I welcome them to eat a big dinner with no main course, only side dishes. It's Not Fun, and it's really alienating to not be included in the meal with a main course you can eat. Also, making fun of how people talk isn't ever funny, people get about one (1) pass and after that it's pretty much just bullying. If you would rather stay in the States and HE'S insisting you move back home instead of helping you set down roots here, he's not really making that much of a sacrifice. Sure he IS, but it's hardly like you're dragging him kicking and screaming. You both have things to gain by moving back to your home! Him acting like you don't is weird.\n\nIf you \"both have to make sacrifices\" and your comfort isn't worth his own happiness, tell him you'll only come if you can bring your own food (seriously, you're pregnant, and while my house has a rule of 'if you want something we can't make you can bring it yourself and share' all the time, it is Objectively Unreasonable for them to not let you bring food to eat when you're pregnant) OR he only eats what you can at Thanksgiving. Fair is fair, right? We all have to make sacrifices.\n\n(Seriously, him letting them make fun of you, when there are more than decent odds your child will speak like you as well is a \ud83d\udea9. Also, if you love someone, you don't want them to go hungry. Like, full stop. Ask yourself if you would put your partner in that situation, or if it would make you upset to know they were struggling. Loving someone is wanting them to be happy, even if you have to make little sacrifices. Sticking up for you and your needs isn't a little sacrifice, it should be an unspoken expectation. Failing that, skipping a day of being with you on a holiday you don't celebrate is a little sacrifice. Asking you to go hungry and spend time with people who are unkind to you... that's just cruel. Talk to him, and explain, because if this is how he treats you regularly you have bigger problems than a single silly holiday)", "NTA.

Many many years I went to the US for an in-person gathering of people who played an online role playing game. I\u2019m Canadian but I have American friends and family and have spent a fair bit of time on that side of border. However, I spent most of my time in Seattle, where a Canadian accent is barely discernible, let alone exotic. It had never occurred to me that going to Baltimore, to a gathering where a very large percentage of attendees were Americans who lived nowhere near the Canadian border, that I would hear, every time I opened my mouth: \u201cOh, she said \u2018aboot!\u2019 That\u2019s so cute!\u201d\n\nOver and over again. All weekend. It was never malicious; everyone seemed to think my accent was adorable.

Thanksgiving now is a day to come together with close friends and family and give thanks for all that you have in life, have a good meal and watch some football. I understand not growing up with the holiday means it\u2019s not something you care about or fully understand, but calling it strange is kinda outta pocket.

The point of having the child in the UK is to establish residency and thus make it the UK's courts responsibility to sort out custody, who will generally decide the child should stay there and dad can visit if he wants to.\n\n\nIf OP willingly moves back with her child, that would change their residency and the jurisdiction over to US courts. At that point it doesn't matter where the child was born, the child is now a (dual) US citizen living in the US. US courts, similar to their UK counterparts, will look to keep the status quo and the child's residence in the US. Then OP will be stuck either living in the US with their child or only being allowed visitation flying in from the UK until the child is 18.\n\n\nNow if OP really really wants to move back to the US and still has a good relationship with the father then she should also talk to an immigration lawyer, who would probably tell her to go the marriage route as it has the most protections and shortest wait time to be eligible for citizenship afterwards. But there really isn't a great way for an immigrant to move to the US with a dual citizen child without being at a significant disadvantage when it comes to custody and there almost certainly isn't a way to change your mind afterwards (for example if he acts nice and reigns his family in until they move, then becomes a dick when she's trapped) unless she's willing to leave her child behind.", "This needs to be top comment because holy shit I didn\u2019t even consider that.", "There are a LOT of misogynistic asshats in this subreddit who hate pregnant people PERIOD.

Mountain ppl, very different from mid-areas. One time, my brother was working in the NC/TN mountain area. He asked the restaurant person for a \"ladder\". Puzzled, the man handed bro a Bic \"lighter\".

She didn't know it until she walked in my home and smelled it! C had always loved my lamb before, as I served it regularly, but this was a pregnancy thing.

Given the lack of reasonable accommodations and their treatment of her I can totally see why she didn\u2019t want to celebrate.

Thinking back, as long as a person could abide dairy, we had sort of vegetarian items in the 60 and 70s. Mom cooked the stuffing in a casserole dish and it was meat products free, unless we wanted to top with giblet gravy. Oh, the onions and celery!

Their Thanksgiving turkey stuffing was almost entirely made of pork sausage, and even the greens were greasy because they were fried in bacon fat and topped with bacon: nothing was spared. Texas \"chili\" is basically just a sloppy Joe in a bowl, with some lonely kidney beans here and there, which my family served with peanut butter bread(\u203d). I once ordered the potato skin dish from a restaurant there without the bacon, saying that all of the other toppings were fine, and after the server exclaimed \"WITHOUT THE BACON??\", I was served 3 thin potatoes topped with just one Kraft single each, nothing else. I was almost surprised that the cake didn't have a meat filling too, though it *was* made out of some sort of pink soda. \n\nI lost so much weight during my couple of months in Texas. I'm better now and I can eat meat, but I'm getting nauseous rn thinking about how heavy and meat-laden all their food is.
