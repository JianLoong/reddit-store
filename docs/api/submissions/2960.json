Another thing, he offered to come to my home. When I found out I was pregnant I\u2019d offered to stay, I didn\u2019t even bring up or mention moving and told him we\u2019d look into permanent housing instead of our current set up and he said we\u2019d go back to my home**\n\n**Some of these comments are giving me a stress headache, I\u2019m reading them but the most common one is that I\u2019m dragging him away so obviously I\u2019ll be speaking to him about that, I\u2019ll tell him I will come if they can suck up me bring a veggie dish, next time they want to jab at me I will be making a comment back as apparently it\u2019s something to suck up!

I get not wanting/being able to cook more food to accommodate, but not letting you bring anything yourself is needlessly cruel. To anyone saying \"pick a side dish and suck it up\" I welcome them to eat a big dinner with no main course, only side dishes. It's Not Fun, and it's really alienating to not be included in the meal with a main course you can eat. Also, making fun of how people talk isn't ever funny, people get about one (1) pass and after that it's pretty much just bullying. If you would rather stay in the States and HE'S insisting you move back home instead of helping you set down roots here, he's not really making that much of a sacrifice. Sure he IS, but it's hardly like you're dragging him kicking and screaming. You both have things to gain by moving back to your home! Him acting like you don't is weird.\n\nIf you \"both have to make sacrifices\" and your comfort isn't worth his own happiness, tell him you'll only come if you can bring your own food (seriously, you're pregnant, and while my house has a rule of 'if you want something we can't make you can bring it yourself and share' all the time, it is Objectively Unreasonable for them to not let you bring food to eat when you're pregnant) OR he only eats what you can at Thanksgiving. Fair is fair, right? We all have to make sacrifices.\n\n(Seriously, him letting them make fun of you, when there are more than decent odds your child will speak like you as well is a \ud83d\udea9. Also, if you love someone, you don't want them to go hungry. Like, full stop. Ask yourself if you would put your partner in that situation, or if it would make you upset to know they were struggling. Loving someone is wanting them to be happy, even if you have to make little sacrifices. Sticking up for you and your needs isn't a little sacrifice, it should be an unspoken expectation. Failing that, skipping a day of being with you on a holiday you don't celebrate is a little sacrifice. Asking you to go hungry and spend time with people who are unkind to you... that's just cruel. Talk to him, and explain, because if this is how he treats you regularly you have bigger problems than a single silly holiday)", "NTA.

It was the partners comments of her not trying to settle and me not understanding why he'd say that when she has every intention of moving back here.  If I were her it would make me concerned that he was hoping I'd change my mind and stay in the US.", "right!!! like they\u2019re literally bullying a pregnant woman and she\u2019s just suppose to take it?", "Yeah that\u2019s the part where I\u2019m offended for you. You\u2019re literally growing a human, so you need to eat!! It\u2019s not special treatment to make sure a pregnant person eats \ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s human decency! And you\u2019re still your own person with your own dietary preferences, you don\u2019t have to lose yourself when you become pregnant", "She had not stated that yet when I made my comment. She\u2019s adding highly relevant information in dribs and drabs, can\u2019t blame ppl for judging on the original post.", "Because they will be in her life forever and she's only given them one chance. Her bf wants her and them to get along and she should atleast try one more time before litterly f*cking off to another country and never having to see them again. \n\nThey aren't abusive or reddit hated parents in law from hell. They are probably just shitty teasing Americans who don't really know better, which sucks but is pretty easily fixed by putting you foot down. She should bring her own dish and have a smile on her face, come up with a good comeback to the two issues they tease her on, they will move on from them pretty quickly if she does. \n\nShe's not used to their teasing and they arent used to having someone hating on their holiday the entire time, these issues can be fixed but not if she doesn't go.\n\n The bf obviously cares about them so she should try more then one time to have an actual relationship with them.", "Looking at your post now there have been plenty of edits to it compared to when I first responded. You aren\u2019t wrong for wanting your husband to stand up for you. Could you probably grow some thicker skin? Sure. But I understand wanting him to have your back. \n\nBut again, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that you won\u2019t have to do this for much longer. So I say again, suck it up. \n\nIt\u2019s not the easiest thing getting along with in laws, trust me I have direct experience with this, but if it comes down to my feelings or the feelings of my wife, I\u2019ll deal with something for a day to make her happy.", "So by that logic, I should just go through life never correcting anyone and die offended and alone. \n\nSometimes people are just boneheads and need to be corrected. \n\nBut yes, he should definitely be telling them to knock it off.", "She said they were this way at least 4 1/2 months prior to that.", "She made her choices. It\u2019s unfortunate.", "Well maybe not necessarily complaining, but he\u2019s really making her feel bad about thanksgiving as if she\u2019s the one who\u2019s making him move.", "You are great, jessszilla", "Not just growing a human, she\u2019s literally growing THEIR grandchild and they\u2019re happy to mock her and let her go hungry for being \u201cdifficult\u201d because she doesn\u2019t eat meat. Super NTA. I literally cannot believe all of the y t a comments I\u2019m seeing.", "she did say it was offending her and they ignored her. so what would you like her to do? sit there and be insulted by his family? why his family picks on a pregnant woman is insane to me", "I have done and it\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s implying I\u2019m stupid that\u2019s why I chose to study abroad, or mocking my dental hygiene, yes they tease my accent relentlessly but it\u2019s also the stereotypes and it\u2019s nonstop", "HIS family. HIS job to stand up for her. Regardless of what they are saying, OP is uncomfortable there. HIS family, HIS job to stand up and tell them no."]}
