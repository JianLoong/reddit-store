I (60M) have a daughter \u201cMelissa\u201d who is 26. My wife (57) and I adopted her when she was 3, we\u2019d always known we\u2019d wanted to adopt because both of us were adopted. \n\nWe did everything a parent should do for their children, Melissa went to the best schools, got to pick wherever she wanted to go on vacation and got everything she desired, my wife even quit her job as a psychologist to be a more hands on parent and I went into private healthcare so I could work less hours in order to be around more. I\u2019d always prided myself on the fact that Melissa knew what she wanted in life and she had good grades throughout her school career, she graduated and took a year off to find herself, something my wife and I supported. \n\nAfter her year, she decided she wanted to go into law, she enrolled at a very prestigious college, for two years we paid for college related expenses only to find out she hadn\u2019t even set foot at the college and was living a life of luxury in California. When confronted, she informed us that she\u2019d prefer to live off our money and we we\u2019re rich enough to provide that for her. I said that\u2019s not happening and she\u2019d have to find a way to make money. She started a business that was going well then she sold it and said she\u2019d live off that money instead. Well, as you guessed, the money ran out and she was back to asking us for money. I told her we cannot continue to support her at 26 and she has a younger brother who\u2019s starting college in the next year so we\u2019re focused more on him. \n\nShe then asked me why I adopted her if I was not going to provide her with a life of luxury because only rich people adopt. I was hurt in that moment and I told her that had I known she\u2019d turn out to be a selfish, entitled brat, I wouldn\u2019t have adopted her. She stopped talking to my wife and I, my sister says I am being selfish because I am able to provide that type of life for Melissa. So AITA? \n\nSummary: My daughter does not want to work and would like me to financially support her so I called her entitled and said I wish I never adopted her.", "created_utc": 1676163505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1103175/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_wish_i_hadnt/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did she ever have to work for it?  She is acting entitled,  which isn't good, but usually that is a learned behavior. \n\nThe short of it is that you don't owe her a thing, but if this is how you raised her, then what did you expect?", "Well... \"she got everything she desired\" isn't always the recipe for best parenting. I mean, it sounds like you spoiled the hell out of your daughter growing up and now are surprised that she's turned into a spoiled and entitled adult. \n\nI mean yes, the way she's acting is entirely unreasonable and at 26 it's well past time for her to grow the hell up and take some responsibility for herself. But also... sounds like this is the person you and your wife raised her to be so you're at least partially responsible for how she turned out. \n\nESH", "She really betrayed your trust when she pretended to go college and does seem very entitled. However, she probably won't forget those words. \n\nESH.", "ESH. You spoiled her, and now you're angry that she turned out spoiled. You created this whole problem. Your post even lays out how: you gave her everything she desired, let her pick out vacations, sent her to rich elite schools. None of it says anything about her personality or your relationship, only what you gave her. Only what you bought for her. Nothing about love or teaching her anything. You did what so many people of financial means do: you created another selfish rich person and can't even step outside yourself enough to understand that you're the root cause of it all.", "ESH. It sounds like she never heard the word no from you growing up. You gave her everything she wanted and now that what she wants is for you to continue financially supporting her, she is hearing \"no\" for the first time. She became a \"selfish, entitled brat\" because you enabled her to become one. IMO you can't claim you wish you hadn't adopted her since she only became what you raised her to be.\n\nRegardless of that, at 26 people should be looking at, and understanding the world they live in. While adoption is expensive, it isn't only the rich that adopt, and everyone needs to make their own way in the world. Time for a heavy dose of reality.", "From an adopted person, ESH. She can\u2019t just expect to live off her parents for the rest of her life, but I honestly don\u2019t know what I would do if my parents said that to me. \n\nThat\u2019s a relationship ending statement, and I don\u2019t know if you get that. It\u2019s pretty equivalent to saying you\u2019d wish she\u2019d been aborted. You wish she never came into your lives. You can feel that, there\u2019s not much you can do about those feelings, but you really shouldn\u2019t SAY IT. Especially over something that could have just been a boundary, a line in the sand about funding her life. \n\nYour brought her into your home, into your life. You  raised her from the age 3 and up. You have had a significant amount of influence over her life, and so her personality now is more because of your influence. You literally wrote out that you gave her everything she desired, and now your surprised when she\u2019s expecting you to continue giving her everything she desires? You helped create this. \n\nSo yeah, you\u2019re a giant AH, and I can\u2019t believe you are actually asking that. What were you hoping to accomplish saying that to her? She\u2019s an entitled AH too, but it may be more of a symptom from her parents.", "ESH. Idk what\u2019s going on with your daughter. But she is being selfish and everything you said. \n\n\nBut saying if you had known she would have turned out like this you \u201cwouldn\u2019t have adopted her\u201d meaning that your love is conditional on the idea that she make the right decision. Guess what, that\u2019s the gamble you take as a parent. If you only want them when they\u2019re perfect then maybe they shouldn\u2019t have given you a child .", "ESH because you raised her to be a selfish, entitled brat, and then feign surprise when that's exactly what she turned out to be. This is what happens when you put kids on pedestals, let them choose the family vacations, take a year off to \"find themselves,\" and then don't even ask to see the grades of the classes for which you paid for two whole years. You're just reaping what you've sown. Nobody has a surprise harvest.\n\nYou're not TA because of what you said to her, but what you should have said is, \"I provided you with every advantage in life, as a *child*, to be able to pursue any dream you wanted. Now it's time for you to pursue something you're passionate about. I would never want to deprive you of that experience. It's one of the great joys of *adult* life.\"\n\nAnd, no, not everyone who adopts is rich.

That type of behavior is typically a reflection of the parents.", "Whether a child is adopted or biologically yours - if you spoil them, they'll end up entitled. In your effort to provide her with a good life (perhaps even more so because she did come from less fortunate beginnings), did you give her too much, too easily?\n\nYou're TA for saying what you did - those words shouldn't be uttered. She's your kid, full stop. You're NTA for establishing some financial boundaries.", "ESH.

Entitled children grow up to be entitled adults.", "NTA - Two years of law school tuition blown on living the high life. Smh. As a parent, did you ever ask about her courses, or visited her at the supposed law school. Sounds like she grifted you. She already told you her plan about just living off your wealth. Unfortunately tough love was needed that she never got.", "Good lord ESH. Your daughter sounds like an awful entitled person. What you said was incredibly cruel. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for not continuing to support her in a life of luxury (what an insane thing to demand from your parents at age 26) but you really need to think about whether you played a role in instilling those values in her.", "How involved were you that she was \u201cin school\u201d for 2 years, and you didn\u2019t know?! Sounds like you threw money at her for her entire life to keep her happy, and now that\u2019s not working for you?", "YTA for actually saying you wish you hadn't adopted her\n\nYTA also because this behavior didn't come out of nowhere.

I failed my first year and upon pleading with you to let me change courses you refused, then acted surprised when I failed my second year, telling people I wasted your money. I pleaded with you to let me study what I want to which you said I was better off marrying rich, you hinted that you preferred for me to not work and just mooch off someone but when that someone is you, it\u2019s wrong. Finally, you saying you wish you didn\u2019t adopt me is sugarcoating things, you said you wish you would\u2019ve left me to die as a crack baby. Have a nice life.

Being adopted yourself, how would you feel to have one of your parents said that to you?\n\nIs your daughter another ethnicity than you? If so did you give her access to her community while she was growing up? From the stories I have seen on tik tok, a lot of resentment can grow when people finally have access to community and realised what they have been missing. Not an excuse for what she said, but it could be where those feelings are coming from.\n\nWe need to have empathy for our children and the experiences they have had that have shaped them into who they are. Sometimes parents inadvertently hurt their children and those small hurts build over time into much bigger hurts. We need to take accountability and meet them halfway.\n\nIf your daughter is open to it, perhaps look at family therapy. Having a professional help us work through our motivations in a safe environment can help us work through unresolved trauma and reach a level of understanding that is difficult to reach when we start saying hurtful things to be hurtful.\n\nIt is your daughters right to cut contact with you. She does not owe you anything. Our children are not our property or investment, so when we say or do something out of line we run the risk of losing them. Because nobody should have to put up with people who make them feel like shit.\n\nEven if your daughter doesn't consent to family therapy, I think you would really benefit from seeing a therapist. Being adopted, you no doubt have your own unresolved trauma that led to you lashing out with the most hurtful thing you could think of saying.\n\nI hope you are able to come at this with understanding and you are able to let your hurt feelings go", "Depends....\n\nWere you intending to say, \"You're dead to me.\" with your comment?  If so, then it was effective communications and NTA.  After all, a grown ass child who acts like that NEEDS to be cut loose and left to fend on their own if for no other reason than to give them some perspective.

Having to grow up knowing that your biological parents gave you away and then to be told that your adoptive parent wishes they never adopted you is honestly really devastating to hear. My heart breaks for her.\n\nIf what you are saying is true about how she just wants to live off you forever, then she is being extremely entitled. She obviously has the smarts to make money as she's done it before. Absolutely no reason why she can't do it again. Alternatively, though, she could have just said what she said out of anger and stress as she was broke and needed help.

To me it really reads like because she was adopted by someone who could provide a good life for her - you just expected her to automatically feel these things and be appreciative for your kind actions. It reads like you adopted, less because you wanted children and a family, and more because you wanted to give someone a good life. While the two combined are great, without the desire for a family it ends ups lacking.

I (60M) have a daughter \u201cMelissa\u201d who is 26. My wife (57) and I adopted her when she was 3, we\u2019d always known we\u2019d wanted to adopt because both of us were adopted. \n\nWe did everything a parent should do for their children, Melissa went to the best schools, got to pick wherever she wanted to go on vacation and got everything she desired, my wife even quit her job as a psychologist to be a more hands on parent and I went into private healthcare so I could work less hours in order to be around more. I\u2019d always prided myself on the fact that Melissa knew what she wanted in life and she had good grades throughout her school career, she graduated and took a year off to find herself, something my wife and I supported. \n\nAfter her year, she decided she wanted to go into law, she enrolled at a very prestigious college, for two years we paid for college related expenses only to find out she hadn\u2019t even set foot at the college and was living a life of luxury in California. When confronted, she informed us that she\u2019d prefer to live off our money and we we\u2019re rich enough to provide that for her. I said that\u2019s not happening and she\u2019d have to find a way to make money. She started a business that was going well then she sold it and said she\u2019d live off that money instead. Well, as you guessed, the money ran out and she was back to asking us for money. I told her we cannot continue to support her at 26 and she has a younger brother who\u2019s starting college in the next year so we\u2019re focused more on him. \n\nShe then asked me why I adopted her if I was not going to provide her with a life of luxury because only rich people adopt. I was hurt in that moment and I told her that had I known she\u2019d turn out to be a selfish, entitled brat, I wouldn\u2019t have adopted her. She stopped talking to my wife and I, my sister says I am being selfish because I am able to provide that type of life for Melissa. So AITA? \n\nSummary: My daughter does not want to work and would like me to financially support her so I called her entitled and said I wish I never adopted her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
