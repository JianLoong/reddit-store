You also mentioned that in order to see into your window, they'd have to be looking down: you could put blinds halfway down or safety pin the curtains up so that they don't block the fan, only the view. You can also get plastic that adheres to windows to give them a frosted, privacy look.

If there are kids, then they'll be as capable and as stupid as the other kids who've taken pictures of naked neighbors. When they want to be stupid, they'll do whatever they can to fulfill that.

A roommate walking down the hall is much more likely to catch a glimpse with a door open than a neighbor is with a window open. When you make a conscious effort to see what is on the other side of a window into a house that is not your own, what you see is on you and not the person you see. You have a reasonable expectation of privacy when inside your own home/room and as long as you aren't doing something vulgar you can do as you please. Looking in the window of a home that isn't yours is more a problem than what's going on behind that window. Legally, in most places, you can stand in the middle of your living room naked regardless of the giant picture window. If someone walks by and looks in and sees you in your birthday suit, too bad for them. They'll likely learn not to look in anymore windows.

There's a reasonable expectation of privacy and it's actually more of a problem for someone looking in windows than a person being naked on the other side of the glass.

That's why I don't use definitive terms like 'all' and 'everywhere' and such. Yes there are places that will find ways to charge the person in the home but more often than not the laws are favorable to them if it's simple nudity like watching TV nude or cleaning nude. As soon as you start watching other people and drawing attention to yourself then it becomes indecent. You have to remember there are also peeping tom laws where looking into a bedroom window is far worse than someone being naked in their own room. It all depends on the place and age of the laws as they vary everywhere", "But is it worth the potential hassle when there are cases?

What's legal isn't always moral and what's moral isn't always legal. To me: no it's not worth the hassle and I'm likely to self conscious to even allow someone to see me without it being behind closed doors or at the very least consensual. But some don't care and care more about what they can do than how you feel about them doing it. So that's a battle to be decided by the individual\n\nEdit: I wasn't calling you out about definitive terms I was simply stating that I don't ever believe things to be all one way or the other.

For one being naked in your room isn't indecent and for 2 you have a reasonable expectation of privacy in your own home/room. It's actually on the people lookin in windows that aren't theirs.

Because you are purposely doing it at that point.", ">increase the chances of these charges", "I don't disagree. But in this case in particular: they're on the 5th floor.

You have the right to be naked, but you don't have the right to expose everyone else to you being naked.", "No it your windows are across from them and they can see you without having to really look it's indecent exposure. You have the right to be naked but they also have the right now to be exposed to what you are doing.  I'm not going to argue with you. I know the law.", "Someone looking into your windows isn't you exposing them it's them exposing themselves", "That only applies if your house is 10 feet away from your neighbor and you can have a normal conversation without even getting up to go to the window. If you're across the street, especially say a city street and you're on different floors of different buildings, you can't 'just see' someone without making a conscious effort to look. In most cases you have to make an effort to look which means you had to try to see what was behind the window. If they're minding their business watching TV or cleaning or whatever there was no reason for you to look in the window. If they called you out and said 'hey look at me' then yes it's entirely on them. Otherwise mind your business"]}
