How many more times this week\"", "NTA\n\nIf people are \u201cpeeping\u201d into your window that\u2019s on them. They can close their blinds if they don\u2019t want to see something.

I suggest to either read your city/HOA's regulations regarding this, or directly have a conversation with the family to see if you are bothering them.", "If you're exposed and visible in a way where they MIGHT be able to see you from their window, YTA. Find another way to keep the inside of your room hidden and maximize airflow. Or at least put on some underwear.", "I'd close the blinds if you're tryna keep heat out. Your roommate is trying to make you feel like a freak anyhow and that's not cool. Its not perverted to exist naked in your bedroom with normal person intentions of cooling off.

To protective parents or law enforcement, it will come across as suspicious that you're considerate enough to close the door so you're not flashing your roommates, but leave the windows wide open to a family across the way.\n\nIt's not like wearing underpants will make you that much hotter. You also mentioned that in order to see into your window, they'd have to be looking down: you could put blinds halfway down or safety pin the curtains up so that they don't block the fan, only the view. You can also get plastic that adheres to windows to give them a frosted, privacy look. I have some that have a prismatic effect that brightens up my space, and I've seen some new ones that look like stained glass designs. If there are complaints, you can point to these measures and then it seems like they're the creeps for looking in your windows.", "Your not my neighbour, so I couldn't give a fuck", "If there are neighbors\u2019 windows directly across from you and they could see into your room, YTA.\n\nCheck your local laws, but in a lot of places you can\u2019t be blatantly naked in front of an open window like that.  Not even \u201cin your own space\u201d - because, as OP pointed out, kids could see you.  Your neighbors could see you.  \n\nYou know you\u2019re exposing yourself, and you\u2019re still doing it anyway.  YTA.  At least get an opaque sheet or something so no one can see in to your room.", "NTAH", "YTA because you're using assumptions.\n\nYou're assuming that the neighbors would have to make an effort to see into your apartment. But, you don't live there and don't know the view.\n\nYou're assuming that they won't look. This is a family. If there are kids, then they'll be as capable and as stupid as the other kids who've taken pictures of naked neighbors. When they want to be stupid, they'll do whatever they can to fulfill that. They also have cellphones with WiFi. It's an assumption that they wouldn't post the pictures or send them to friends that might post it.\n\nYou either leave the blinds open while acknowledging that you can be seen or you put privacy film to prevent being seen.", "YTA, that doesn't sound like it would be harder to see you than them simply using their window and looking in a general downward direction. If it's like a neck craning view to see in then N.A.H.\n\nAlso think about some of the consequences of living next to immature kids with cellphones? I'd personally rather pay for sheer curtains or a reflective film for the window over a lawyer to issue cease and desist letters and takedown notices. \n\nLegally are you right? 99% sure yes if you live in a reasonable place.", "YTA", "Just close your blinds. Kids get bored and look around. You know kids live there so the chances of them seeing you fully naked aren\u2019t actually that low.", "If your neighbors complain, file peeping Tom charges.", "Leaving aside whether you're TA, you should buy some blackout curtains and put them up, then drape them so that they leave the box fan exposed.  It'll stop more heat from getting in and solve this problem.", "Yta. Just close the fucking blinds", "Unfortunately if kids can see you naked it can be big trouble even in your own house. It\u2019s kind of a mess\n\nGet the peel and stick window covers that let on light but has the frosty affect so no one cam see anything other than blurry outlines.", "YTA and also opening your blinds makes it hotter, not cooler.
