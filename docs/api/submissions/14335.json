I went into the public restroom where I saw some guy brushing his teeth. OH, and he was very animated about it, like it was the highlight of his day or something.  While I was grossed out, I still observed.  Kind of like watching a train wreck...you are horrified, but can't look away.\n\nHe was eventually spitting on the sink.  Note I didn't say in the sink, I said ON the sink.  What he was spitting out hit all areas of the sink, including the outside edges, the faucet and the FAUCET HANDLE.  Like he wasn't bent over aiming at the drain.  He was standing up and spraying in a wide pattern from like a couple of feet above the sink.  \n\nI was so disgusted, I went to a different building to use a different public restroom.
