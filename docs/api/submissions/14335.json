If she thinks that's disgusting, she probably don't wanna think about what else gets done in there.....", "Lol. NTA. Next time tell her to mind her own mucus.", "NTA \n\nI *wish* I had a life where someone else blowing their nose in a bathroom stall in a Walmart was the absolute *worst* part of my day. Can you imagine what a cakewalk that must be? \n\nYou literally could not have been less intrusive than what you were. That lady must be terrified of her own shadow if things like that bother her.", "NTA. Where the fuck else are you supposed to blow your nose???? The bathroom is the best place so that you can wash your hands afterwards instead of unnecessary touching other door handles and what not", "NTA, literally one of the best places to blow your nose, also you were in a stall! people need to mind their own business in the bathroom", "NTA- Is the woman also going to be upset about people changing diapers and having an emergency poo in the bathroom? The bathroom was absolutely the appropriate place for expelling bodily fluids.", "NTA \n\nCongrats at just apologizing though. I would have grab paper towel or something and blew my nose again.", "NTA. Where are you supposed to blow it if you don\u2019t blow it in the bathroom? All over the produce? That lady is crazy.", "NTA, where else would she rather you do it, by the food?  At the register?  No, you did it in the right place.", "NTA, and you don't need to come to Reddit with every interaction you have with crazy Walmart customers, or else you'll be here 11 times a day.", "NTA wtf lmao. Bathrooms are *the* place for socially gross bodily functions.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think blowing your nose is worse than taking a shit.", "You don\u2019t have to worry if you are an asshole for not following someone\u2019s completely made up rules. NTA.", "NTA. You should have sneezed on her or blew your nose again.", "NTA.\n\nWould she rather you blow your nose right there at the cashier? Also, I've done this like a million times. One time I got sick the day before my hair was supposed to be cut (so I couldn't reschedule) and kept getting up to blow my nose in her public bathroom. Would've been much ruder and disgusting to blow it right there.", "That woman is laughably stupid. I suspect she was grossed out by the sounds and just blurted out the first thing that entered her wee little mind.\n\nNo, you blew your nose in the best place possible: in the bathroom stall.

Not sure I would have had the same restraint.", "No. You have the patience of a saint.", "NTA.  That shouldn't bother anybody at all.  The thing that bugs me is all the people brushing their teeth in the public restrooms.  Even before the pandemic, that was gross.  But now we have a deadly and highly contagious virus that lives in the throat.  And we have people spitting all over sinks that other people use to wash their hands...", "NTA.  I do not know what planet she comes from, but I am not sure it's earth.  I have never heard of this before.", "NTA.", "NTA. Did she think you were doing cocaine?

Absolute most polite I will be with it is stepping outside someone's direct line of sight. That usually only applies when that someone is eating. This old lady is obviously miserable with nothing better to do.", "NTA. She was rude.", "Lol NTA. That lady is being fucking ridiculous.

That's interesting, I wonder where she expects you to fart.\n\nI can understand why a customer might take offense at noticing an employee blowing their nose *anywhere* they've been, but your needs are important, too.", "NTA but I hope you're wearing a mask if you've got a communicable disease at work...", "YTA. Wear a mask while working and don\u2019t blow your nose in a cramped space. You\u2019re probably still contagious.", "NTA.

I don\u2019t understand how this is an issue.", "OK, this first came to my attention a couple of years ago.  There was a sign on the mirror above a sink in a public restroom.  It stated (roughly) \"Please do not brush your teeth in the public bathroom as this is a public health hazard\".  \n\nThe thought that passed through my mind was...who would be stupid enough to do something so gross?  Is it really enough of an issue that someone was motivated to post a sign?\n\nFast forward a few months.  I was in a different building (close to the building with the sign).  I went into the public restroom where I saw some guy brushing his teeth. OH, and he was very animated about it, like it was the highlight of his day or something.  While I was grossed out, I still observed.  Kind of like watching a train wreck...you are horrified, but can't look away.\n\nHe was eventually spitting on the sink.  Note I didn't say in the sink, I said ON the sink.  What he was spitting out hit all areas of the sink, including the outside edges, the faucet and the FAUCET HANDLE.  Like he wasn't bent over aiming at the drain.  He was standing up and spraying in a wide pattern from like a couple of feet above the sink.  \n\nI was so disgusted, I went to a different building to use a different public restroom.  This was the worst part of the pandemic when this happened.  But it would bother me just as much now.\n\nAnyway, imagine THAT GUY was covid positive and contagious, and spitting all over the faucet handle just moments before you arrive to wash your hands, grabbing the faucet handle..."]}
