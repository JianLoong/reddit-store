I live in an apartment right now but it's not the most accessible. \n\nFor example the sink in the kitchen and bathroom have cabinets underneath so he can't really use them without being in an awkward position. And the stove is to high for him to use it safely. He can't reach most of the dishes if the were in the higher cabinets. The showers also really small and his shower bench barely fits. I've tried to rearrange this to make them easier for him but it's still hard. \n\n2 years ago I started getting a house built for us. For most of his childhood I've struggled financially, but I was finally able to afford to build a house accessible to him.   \n\nI showed my girlfriend a plan of the house when we first started dating and she said it looked fine. We went to go see the progress a few days ago since it's almost done and we're almost ready to move in. \n\nWhen we got there she mentioned how the stove and sink were too low. My son can't do much in the kitchen because of his paralysis but he loves to help. Having the stove accessible will help him have more independence and he can start learning himself which he's really happy about. \n\nOur stove and sink has a little space under it so he can slide his wheelchair in to cook and is low enough so it's like a table if that makes since. The oven and microwave are also low enough for him. My gf says it'll be uncomfortable for her too cook at. I told her that she can pull up a chair and sit if that's better but she refuses. She says she doesn't want to live with me if she's going to be uncomfortable forever. She also says  that my son will move out in a few years so we don't even need to spend all this money on a house. I told her that we could renovate some things after he moves out but she doesn't want to wait that long. I said if it was a problem she could figure something else out to make her comfortable or leave. \n\nSome people are telling me I was too harsh but Im tired of people complaining about accessibility to disable people because it inconveniences them a little.
