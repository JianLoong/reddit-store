I live in an apartment right now but it's not the most accessible. \n\nFor example the sink in the kitchen and bathroom have cabinets underneath so he can't really use them without being in an awkward position. And the stove is to high for him to use it safely. He can't reach most of the dishes if the were in the higher cabinets. The showers also really small and his shower bench barely fits. I've tried to rearrange this to make them easier for him but it's still hard. \n\n2 years ago I started getting a house built for us. For most of his childhood I've struggled financially, but I was finally able to afford to build a house accessible to him.   \n\nI showed my girlfriend a plan of the house when we first started dating and she said it looked fine. We went to go see the progress a few days ago since it's almost done and we're almost ready to move in. \n\nWhen we got there she mentioned how the stove and sink were too low. My son can't do much in the kitchen because of his paralysis but he loves to help. Having the stove accessible will help him have more independence and he can start learning himself which he's really happy about. \n\nOur stove and sink has a little space under it so he can slide his wheelchair in to cook and is low enough so it's like a table if that makes since. The oven and microwave are also low enough for him. My gf says it'll be uncomfortable for her too cook at. I told her that she can pull up a chair and sit if that's better but she refuses. She says she doesn't want to live with me if she's going to be uncomfortable forever. She also says  that my son will move out in a few years so we don't even need to spend all this money on a house. I told her that we could renovate some things after he moves out but she doesn't want to wait that long. I said if it was a problem she could figure something else out to make her comfortable or leave. \n\nSome people are telling me I was too harsh but Im tired of people complaining about accessibility to disable people because it inconveniences them a little.

In fact, I probably wouldn\u2019t even notice after awhile.", "Hly sht dad of the year!! NTA in ANY way.\n\nYour gf clearly cant see a future where she's elderly and less able to do things without mobility aids, to say nothing of her lack of empathy for son right now. If this is her hill to die on, maybe it's where you leave her. \n\nPersonally i think your house sounds amazing (I love to cook but i tire easily and can often be found sitting during prep/cook time. I am now extremely jealous.)", "Well GF of a year bye", "NTA.  And she can just jog on if she doesn't like it.  Your son shouldn't have to be unable to do things more comfortably in his own home because she finds it inconvenient for her.", "Forgot to vote! NTA!", "NTA your son is your responsibility and you are doing a great job in helping him getting more experience towards being independent one day.\n\nIf your GF can't live with that she needs to find another accommodation. Please do not forget how she is acting now towards your son. This isn't a good sign.", "NTA and drop this woman like a bad habit. I'd have showed her the door when she started complaining knowing damn well why your home is being set up like it is. This won't end well and I personally wouldn't trust her with your child alone.", "NTA. What's this \"we\" she refers to about spending the money? It's not her money, why is she trying to claim it? Look at the color of the flags she's waving. They're a very bright, bold red.", "NTA! The son may be better off staying 20 years. You never really get rid of kids. They\u2019re always on your mind. It\u2019s up to the newcomer to fit in !", "Get rid of her ASAP", "Your son should come first, you are doing the right thing. Girlfriend wasn\u2019t even around when you started, so of course she gets no say. How does she treat your son? \n\nNTA", "Hard NTA. Get a new girlfriend.", "NTA. You're not putting his comfort over hers, you're accommodating to his abilities. She's ridiculous.", "Dude he's your son, she's a girl. I may not have a kid but I'll be five shades fucked if anyone thinks I'ma put them before my child. You're doing the right thing by your son, and she needs to go if she can't handle a few years of a wheelchair accessible house", "Your son comes first\n\nIf you gf can't see that AND accept that; I would think twice about bringing her in as family", "Her reasoning was horrendous.", "I'm so glad OP designed an entire home to meet his sons needs. The girlfriend is slightly inconvenienced. But it will make such a difference in his son's life.\n\nPersonally, I have a small disability that makes standing for long periods increasingly painful. I also love to cook. Just hearing about that kitchen makes me want an adjustable office swivel chair to cook in. It sounds awesome!", "This ^ \n\nI've worked with a lot of people who had a wide range of disabilities and it's unreal to see how insensitive people can be when reacting to folks with differences in public or put in positions where they are even somewhat inconvenienced for a few moments when the person they are being rude about has to be inconvenienced for their entire life time!\n\nBut it's one thing to have a stranger behave poorly in public and another thing to have your dad's gf/wife behave that way in your own home.\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nKeep the modifications... Ditch the evil step-mother in the making.", "Especially since her main argument is \"he's going to be moving out soon anyway\". For one, even if he's reasonably independent it's a lot harder to move out these days, even as an able-bodied person but *especially* as a disabled person. For two...so he's never going to want to visit home? Come see OP for the holidays and help him cook and shit? That's both awfully presumptuous and possibly even a hint about how she intends to treat him.", "Yes! And what is with her \"we\" don't need to spend all this money on a house bit?? Did she contribute any money to the building of the house? I don't think so, she has no say OP. Your son comes before a relationship with ANY woman. And there are plenty of good women out there who would gladly be with you and your son on the journey.", "I wish I could upvote this a hundred times", "THIS^^^ op you yourself have seen the difficulties he faces on a day to day basis in a conventionally built home. Does she think that as soon as he's 18 he will be able to find a home that has these upgrades that make his life easier? The way she's talking she is definitely going to try kick him out at 18 and If not she will make his life uncomfortable and blame him for all her issues around the house. Don't do this to your son.", "I was wondering this myself. What does it matter if he's turning 18 soon?", "I once saw a remodel on TV that had a stovetop that would lower for accessibility.  Double wall ovens are great too because the lower oven is easier accessed.", "Did you see that she is helping financially support him now so that he can afford the house?\n\nThe entire house should be accessible but they can have an accessible kitchen that is also usable by her. Add a second stove and different height counters and now everyone can cook and be comfortable.", "Indeed. \n\nOP, you have been warned. \n\nNTA", "I did not see that but true love is making sacrifices for those you care about. The child has not known accessibility for the 8 years he\u2019s been paralyzed. If they know he will move out then she can suck it up for a few years and then renovate in my opinion. That\u2019s what a good partner would do. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t show her the blueprints. It\u2019s much easier for her to make accommodations. Uncomfortable, yes but not unbearable. If it\u2019s really that big of a deal then find someone not dedicated to their disabled child. I won\u2019t make him TA for making his son a priority.", "I reread the post and I still don't see where it says she's helping him financially?", "Same!!! OP NTA", "So she\u2019s \u201cnot even his wife\u201d but she should treat him like her true love?\n\nIn a few years her back might be permanently damaged from working at a counter that is the incorrect height. She didn\u2019t even say she wanted to break up, she said she didn\u2019t want to move in with him if it meant being uncomfortable every day for years. There is no universe where that isn\u2019t reasonable. Especially since there is an easy enough solution that accommodates everyone.", "Lol you almost had me. Definitely not going back and forth with the \u201cAsshole Enthusiast\u201d. The cards will fall where they\u2019re meant.", "Right now he helps instead of doing the cooking *because they're using a standard stove* and he literally can't right now.  He's not cooking because he can't.\n\nThat changes once he has an accessible stove.\n\nHe's 16 years old and wants to have the independence of cooking.  I suppose GF could chip in for a 2nd, standard stove and the electrical setup for such.\n\nBut just because he doesn't cook *now* when he literally cannot doesn't mean that he won't in the future when he has facilities which allow him to learn and to do it.", "I\u2019m not sure what you mean? It\u2019s an auto flair from the sub."]}
