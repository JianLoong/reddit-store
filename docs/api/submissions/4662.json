I live in an apartment right now but it's not the most accessible. \n\nFor example the sink in the kitchen and bathroom have cabinets underneath so he can't really use them without being in an awkward position. And the stove is to high for him to use it safely. He can't reach most of the dishes if the were in the higher cabinets. The showers also really small and his shower bench barely fits. I've tried to rearrange this to make them easier for him but it's still hard. \n\n2 years ago I started getting a house built for us. For most of his childhood I've struggled financially, but I was finally able to afford to build a house accessible to him.   \n\nI showed my girlfriend a plan of the house when we first started dating and she said it looked fine. We went to go see the progress a few days ago since it's almost done and we're almost ready to move in. \n\nWhen we got there she mentioned how the stove and sink were too low. My son can't do much in the kitchen because of his paralysis but he loves to help. Having the stove accessible will help him have more independence and he can start learning himself which he's really happy about. \n\nOur stove and sink has a little space under it so he can slide his wheelchair in to cook and is low enough so it's like a table if that makes since. The oven and microwave are also low enough for him. My gf says it'll be uncomfortable for her too cook at. I told her that she can pull up a chair and sit if that's better but she refuses. She says she doesn't want to live with me if she's going to be uncomfortable forever. She also says  that my son will move out in a few years so we don't even need to spend all this money on a house. I told her that we could renovate some things after he moves out but she doesn't want to wait that long. I said if it was a problem she could figure something else out to make her comfortable or leave. \n\nSome people are telling me I was too harsh but Im tired of people complaining about accessibility to disable people because it inconveniences them a little.

Also even if he goes to college in a couple years surely he will visit and stay over vacations and breaks.", "NTA. You're such a good dad! Keep it up!  \nYou've had this home long before your gf was around.", "NTA\n\n>Our stove and sink has a little space under it so he can slide his wheelchair in\n\nthis little detail alone made me smile.\n\nYou're a good dad. and You're right that it is important that your son be able to gain confidence and independence. \n\nYou offered her the solution of sitting. But it's yours and your son's apartment. Not hers. \n\n>I'm tired of people complaining about accessibility to disable people because it inconveniences them a little.\n\nIt IS tiring! you're right. The whole world in inconvenient for disabled people. At the very least, their own hope should be easy for them to exist in.", "NTA\nYou are a brilliant father. Lovely to hear how you are putting your son first.\n\nI can understand how your girlfriend feels but your son's needs are greater.", "NTA.\n\nYour son is likely not going anywhere for a while with today's living costs.", "Nta", "NTA. Why would the son move out if you have already spent all these money and major renovations? I don\u2019t get it. Other places are going to be as inaccessible for him if he\u2019s living alone. \n\nYour gf can get a standalone induction cooker that works on electricity and cook on the kitchen island. I suppose you also have an oven that can be used for cooking too?", "NTA. You\u2019re an amazing father!!", "NTA. What you have done for your son is brilliant", "NTA! Ur an awesome dad, you handled it perfect.", "It's not her house. The house is for you and your son. Her opinion on it really doesn't matter. OP, you are NTA, but your girlfriend certainly is an AH!", "NTA\n\nYour GF is, but you definitely are not.\n\nMaybe you could get a new GF to go with the new house?", "OP,  NTA, I love that you're thinking of your son, as you should. If gf can''t make adjustments for awhile, she's not the one you should have in your life. You are not married to her....your son is blessed to have you as a dad.", "NTA.\n\nOn the other hand, your girlfriend is a big inconvenience.", "NTA. She's not the woman for you.", "I think YTA because although I fully understand that you want to make the house accessible for your son, if he is not the one who is going to make breakfast lunch and dinner, you are condemning your girlfriend to cook sitting down which, no one does, is uncomfortable, and I'm sure it brings accidents.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the accessible house is great, but who's really going to do the cooking? you? if it's you fine, sit down, but if it's not you, you're making her uncomfortable forever for at least 3 times a day.\n\nYou can put things on hand for your son, make a wooden sink that he can use for example (I saw some parents who did that for their young son) put half the food in drawers below, put half the cutlery and glasses drawers below, put an electric stove that he can take out of a drawer and put on a table his size etc. I know I say it very easy, but you are already spending money on that....\n\nEdit: NAH.", "My issue with your GF isn\u2019t necessarily her complaints about the kitchen BUT her apparent idea that your Son will somehow magically disappear after he turns 18.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like she\u2019s willing to bide her time until you Son is out of the house (presumably in college) and then thinks SHE will be your priority.  Flawed thinking, of course, because your Son will always come first and you will always make him the priority.\n\nI\u2019m sure she seems to tick a lot if boxes but to me, she seems to be missing the empathy gene.  I would ask you if you really want to spend your life with someone that emotionally vacant.  \n\nThink you already have on your plate and know, for a fact, there are women out there who would relish being with a man like you, who puts the wellbeing of their kid first.", "She's the asshole not you.", "There\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll move out in a few years or ever. And if he does he might come back home especially if he struggles to find wheelchair accessible housing himself.\n\nNTA", "NTA but I\u2019d def want double of everything ha but obviously not possible but understand her frustration", "NTA. She is just a girlfriend of a year. Of course you are gonna choose your son over her.", "NTA\n\nAgree. Also, gf has only been on the scene for a year, and look how she\u2019s behaving. OP needs to give her the boot.\n\nLove that OP has designed their (OP & son) home to be accessible for his son.", "NTA\nIn the spirit of compromise though (and for your own back, trust me on that), have you looked at a simple 2-positions setup for the stove?\nWe have that at my relative's house. Clearance under, low position for them and then with a button it rises to standard position. It wasn't that costly either, a few hundreds\n\nYour GF approached it the wrong way though, she could have looked at solutions instead of saying \"he'll be out in 2 years so who cares\". That's what makes her TA", "NTA and I'd be reconsidering the relationship. If I were with someone in your position I'd be very proud of my partner for doing such for their child and would be contributing in any way I could to help/teach towards whatever level of independence is possible.", "You get that she doesn't want your son living with you right?\n\nYou sound like a pretty awesome Dad, don't stop being awesome just because you found a girlfriend who doesn't like your son.", "NTA, your son comes before her.", "NTA. Absolutely. Dump the girlfriend ASAP. You\u2019ve been together for a year, but that\u2019s still a \u201c honeymoon\u201d phase. It takes more time than that to really know and understand a potential partner. Your poor kid has been in a wheelchair for half of his life. You\u2019ve made a lot of effort to ensure that your new house is absolutely accessible for your son. Having countertops the proper height for him, that will also accommodate his wheelchair, so he can help prepare food for you both is an awesome goal. His self esteem will be immeasurable, as he can contribute to the workings of the household. If your Gf won\u2019t be \u201ccomfortable\u201d She says she doesn\u2019t want to live with you. There\u2019s your answer. . Well, I don\u2019t want YOU to live with her! She\u2019s going to complain every minute, and probably treat your son as an annoyance. I\u2019d bet anything that she\u2019d start badgering you to place your son in a facility for the disabled. Yes, he might move out on his own in a few years, but that will be his choice, and with your support, he\u2019ll do great. Sorry this is a little long, but it really bothers me. You, as well as your son, will be miserable if she\u2019s in your life, and in your house.", "NTA. She\u2019s pretty opinionated for someone who has been around a year. I think it\u2019s fantastic what your doing for your son and feel the right woman will too", "NTA.  Of course your son gets priority for his needs even if it wasn\u2019t a home that you started planning and building specifically for those needs long before your gf appeared.   She\u2019s a completely unreasonable and self-centered jerk and it would be best for all of you if she leaves because the selfish demands for her own comfort over your son\u2019s needs are not going to stop at this point.", "NTA but they do make counter tops now that you can raise and lower at the push of a button so everyone is comfortable they are extremely nice and are a great way to have and accessible home and also for everyone to be able to use.", "Oh NTA, thank you for thinking of your son", "Idk about anyone else, but being able to cook on a stove while comfortably sitting in a chair sounds phenomenal to me", "NTA, kid comes first always.", "NTA. What your doing is amazing. Not a lot of people think about accessibility to disabled people. And I bet you if it wasn\u2019t law a lot of places wouldn\u2019t have it. What your doing is telling your son you care about him and love him. And no matter what you will help him to live his best life. We need more parents like you.", "NTA. You have behaved in an exemplary fashion. It is your sons house and home as much as anyone else's and you are his father and are doing right by him. Your son can learn in the safety of your home how to be independent as you have ensured the house is disabled accessible. If your girlfriend cannot see how great that is and learn how to adapt then do you really want someone like that around your son? She is, perhaps, someone who sees a disabled person as an inconvenience?", "NTA. Fu*x your gf\u2019s comfort, entitled-ass. Keep doing the good shii you\u2019re doing for your son man. I\u2019d get away from the B as fast as possible. I\u2019m fuming at how inconsiderate a human being can be", "I think you handled it perfectly. NTA", "NTA, you are doing something amazing for your son, your girlfriend should respect that, and anyone who dates someone with a kid should also be aware that kid comes first.", "NTA. Please do these things so your son can access things in the house. I can\u2019t believe your girlfriend is complaining. I hope she isn\u2019t normally so selfish?", "NTA, Your child's needs absolutely come first.  As a parent, your primary role in life is to raise, love and support that child to the best of your ability - which you are doing.  I'm horrified that your  partner isn't 100% on board with a home that enables your son to participate more fully in his own life and care.  It's abhorrent for an adult to prioritise their 'wants' over the 'needs' of a child.  I wouldn't tolerate someone like that in my child's life.  Her priorities are all wrong and your wonderful kiddo deserves better from any adult allowed into his life. I'd open the door and let her find a different path. Then keep going being a great Dad.", "NTA. I'm 35 and I can't imagine putting these kinds of housing demands onto a romantic partner of *one year*, whose teenager is *in a wheelchair*, when I've contributed *nothing* to the building of this house. It's incredibly common for teenagers to stay living at home while going to a local uni/college, let alone after they graduate while they're still establishing themselves in their chosen job field. And who's to say what future housing you'll choose, maybe in ten years you'll end up wanting to buy a different house and give this one to your kid. Maybe you'll want to move across the country or overseas, who knows! \n\nIf she wants a house custom built to *her* requirements and preferences, then she should be actively working towards achieving that goal on her own instead of trying to make *your* house into hers. At the end of the day, you guys have only been together a year. That's nothing. That's peanuts. It's not nearly long enough or committed enough for her to be this entitled to changing your future home to be less accessible *for your kid*.", "Does your son have an occupational therapist? If so, get their input. They\u2019ve probably dealt with this issue before. My sister has MS and has been consulting with her OT on remodeling to make her bathroom more accessible.", "Your plans are excellent, with one exception. Get rid of the girlfriend.", "NTA, take care of your son.\n\nBut as a 6ft woman, take care of your back, too lol.", "NTA! OP, what bothers me is that she\u2019s talking about him moving out eventually. What if he doesn\u2019t? That\u2019s your son. She\u2019s gotta go.", "I'm glad to read that you're willing to explore options. I just don't think we have enough info to judge your gf. I think that your son absolutely needs an accessible space and it's great that you have planned for that. But you and gf also need a space you can cook in safely and comfortably. If gf is bothered because she sees herself in a kitchen she cannot cook in without shoulder and back pain for the next 20 years, while son says he's leaving for med school soon, her complaints seem pretty reasonable.", "who's to say she will still be with him when that happens?", "Same. Standing for more than a few minutes is difficult, having a lower surface so I could sit and cook/wash would make such a big difference in how/what I cook", "Have you ever sat to cook? It's HUGELY cumbersome,  and can also be dangerous.", "His chair is easily mobile, though. Unless they also get a wheelchair just for the kitchen, anyone cooking in it would have to keep moving a chair to different areas (the sink, the stove, cutting board, etc) and getting up and down in order to not be hunched over. Obviously the son's needs should be included, but OP shouldn't count out ergonomics for himself or partner.", "you are not disabled. and your broken foot does not count as a disability, it was a temporary discomfort. OP's son is disabled and having these adjustments will help him immensely and increase his quality of life. to try to compare your broken foot experience with a standard kitchen non less to a disabled person who will have a kitchen that perfectly suits them and compare it as if you understood AND to add that you were happy to get your walking back is very ignorant.", "He was starting to have it built when they first started dating. Why would he consult a new partner on a life changing living arrangement for his son, he was building this house for his son and then she came along. Which she knew this house was specifically being designed to fit his sons needs. Nta, dad don\u2019t change a thing", "I have definitely sat down on a stool and at a table to chop/prep stuff. I mean maybe over a stove it could be dicey but I've seen some very, very long spoons and spatulas in my day. Also when you sit on a stool you can still be above the stove stirring. Also, how tall you vs OP are really does matter. Above average height is not typically the standard.", "If the son can\u2019t cook do to paralysis and only help, what makes GF think he will be able to moved out independently in a couple of years? And for her to have the nerve of suggesting OP shouldn\u2019t waste so much money of his son with disabilities when she\u2019s only been around for ONE year, doesn\u2019t make her an AH??", "Ooo T-rex, i know what air port you were in!\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I took a pic of that t-Rex in october! That honestly sounds like it was so fun flying around the airport terminals on your scooter!", "Personally I think the OP needs to consider his own needs as well. He\u2019s a tall guy (6\u20191) so lowering all of the surfaces will be really bad for his back. My vote is NAH. It\u2019s really uncomfortable to cook in a kitchen that\u2019s placed too low and sitting on a chair and moving it around isn\u2019t even remotely the same.", "OP said in a different comment that the son wants to go to medical school.... how's he planning to do THAT? That seems harder to swing than living independently.", "I was going 'Whheeee - oh crap, was that a T-rex!?' I'm hoping somewhere there is security video of me screeching to a halt and then rolling myself backwards.", "I agree. He could become the prep master... that would suit everyone.", ":-)", "My first thought was omg bengal? As well"]}
