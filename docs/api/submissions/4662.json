My son is paralyzed from the waist down and has been since he was 8. \n\nA year ago I got with my girlfriend (34). I live in an apartment right now but it's not the most accessible. \n\nFor example the sink in the kitchen and bathroom have cabinets underneath so he can't really use them without being in an awkward position. And the stove is to high for him to use it safely. He can't reach most of the dishes if the were in the higher cabinets. The showers also really small and his shower bench barely fits. I've tried to rearrange this to make them easier for him but it's still hard. \n\n2 years ago I started getting a house built for us. For most of his childhood I've struggled financially, but I was finally able to afford to build a house accessible to him.   \n\nI showed my girlfriend a plan of the house when we first started dating and she said it looked fine. We went to go see the progress a few days ago since it's almost done and we're almost ready to move in. \n\nWhen we got there she mentioned how the stove and sink were too low. My son can't do much in the kitchen because of his paralysis but he loves to help. Having the stove accessible will help him have more independence and he can start learning himself which he's really happy about. \n\nOur stove and sink has a little space under it so he can slide his wheelchair in to cook and is low enough so it's like a table if that makes since. The oven and microwave are also low enough for him. My gf says it'll be uncomfortable for her too cook at. I told her that she can pull up a chair and sit if that's better but she refuses. She says she doesn't want to live with me if she's going to be uncomfortable forever. She also says  that my son will move out in a few years so we don't even need to spend all this money on a house. I told her that we could renovate some things after he moves out but she doesn't want to wait that long. I said if it was a problem she could figure something else out to make her comfortable or leave. \n\nSome people are telling me I was too harsh but Im tired of people complaining about accessibility to disable people because it inconveniences them a little.

To plan a home's layout for a girlfriend is pretty shortsighted, especially when there's an actual family member that would benefit from the layout that OP has.

It's much cheaper to add two sinks now, while you're building the house, and I'm sure there are people out there who have figured out how to raise/lower stoves so everyone could use it.

You\u2019re building a house from the ground up, you\u2019re also dating and likely planning for this house to be where you\u2019ll live with the eventual partner and son, and here you\u2019re making fixed set up that only 1/3 of people can use comfortably. Not the best planning IMO. \nI bet all my money 6 months in, as OP is sitting on a weird height bench trying to whisk eggs and breaking his back or as he\u2019s washing the dishes hunched over, alone since he told his GF to suck it up or GTFO, and his son tells him he\u2019s moving out next year, that he finally goes and understands how he could\u2019ve done a little tiny bit more planning to make his custom house fully functional for everyone. Can\u2019t wait for that update \ud83e\udd72\nAnyways; they can make what they want with their money, but then don\u2019t be surprised if people aren\u2019t ok putting up with an inflexible unadaptable set up.

There's zero indication that OP has tried to find something that works for everyone.   I'm not a home builder, but I suspect that there are easy solutions that would leave everybody comfortable in the kitchen.  OP should investigate, which it really looks like he hasn't done.  Yes, GF threw a tantrum after the kitchen setup sunk in, which was an AH move, but I understand her frustration.  OP is so excited to make the house work for his son (which is great!  and which he SHOULD do since children come first!) that he doesn't seem to be taking other people's comfort into account in a place they would live.  I wouldn't want to cook in that kitchen either.  If a couple easy tweaks can make everyone happy (again, \\*not\\* at the expense of accessibility for son), why wouldn't you do that?

It's OP's money and OP's house. How much is SHE spending on it? Also, she's expecting the son to move out so I wouldn't put it past her to guilt him into moving out. He's an inconvenience to her so, doing anything for him is a waste of good money. Not her money but, money she wants access to. I wouldn't put her name on the house as she's obviously greedy and selfish. I'd rethink the girlfriend.

You want that house to be completely and legally yours", "\"Slightly inconvenienced.\" lol. I think people here are in denial about just how frustrating something like this would be. If anybody here had to bend over to cook for even a week it would entirely change their eating habits and the first thing you people would do is get a replacement stove. Get a hunchback or chronic back pain? That's more than a \"slight inconvenience.\"\n\nAnd before anybody downvotes, go home tonight and get a step ladder and cook from \\~2 feet off the ground and then do it for the rest of the week then tell me you want to do that for the rest of your life.\n\nOP is not an asshole, obviously. It's his house and he's making it comfortable for his son. GF is not an asshole for not wanting to live in a maddeningly frustrating funhouse situation for the next few years and that's assuming once he moves out they would change the stove (OP probably wouldn't because that would make his son feel unwelcome).

The landlord either already was her friend or became her friend and when i was a kid over a decade ago the place was renovated and made perfect for her so she's definitely never going to find something so accessible.

(I'm sure there are other solutions to getting your son involved other than lowering the stove).

That's unfortunately not something that can be adapted for people who have to sit unless another person is helping. This is how I learned to cook as a kid- my mom wrecked her leg in a car accident.
