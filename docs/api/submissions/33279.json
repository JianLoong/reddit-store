{"id": 33279, "submission_id": "18lamcy", "title": "AITA for cancelling my flight home and making my mom cry?", "selftext": "I (M18) grew up in a small town in the Canadian prairies. Life was pretty fun but definitely a bit boring. Back then, the closest \u201ccity\u201d to us was still a 2.5-hour drive and didn\u2019t even have a population of 250k. Fast forward to this year, and I started uni in a big city, and wow! Life is completely different here. Honestly, the amount of stuff to see and do is crazy. It felt overwhelming at first, but I feel that I adapted to the chaos.\n\nDuring my first semester in uni, I also made some really good friends. One of them (John, M18) invited me to stay with his family at their cabin, where we\u2019d be going skiing, and my gf (Kate, F18) wanted to take me to a few different places and introduce me to her family. A bunch of my other friends have also invited me to various things throughout the break.\n\nHere's the thing: I had planned on going home for the break and staying with my parents and younger siblings. My family was under the impression that I\u2019d be coming home. However, given how many things have popped up on me, I decided to cancel my flight home. For those wondering, my flight was supposed to be on Dec/19.\n\nI was talking with my mom last night when I happened to mention it to her. Needless to say, she sounded very surprised and disappointed. She said that while she understood why I\u2019d want to stay with my friends, she and the rest of the family were looking forward to me coming back. She started saying things like she had already made my bed, that my siblings were planning a bunch of things with me for when they got off school and how she was hoping for a full house again.\n\nI told her that while I appreciated that, going home seemed boring in all honesty considering that I had many opportunities to hang out with my friends here. She started getting upset and saying things like how I should maybe try coming home for even part of the break and that she missed me, etc.\n\nI started getting annoyed because I felt that she was attempting to undermine my boundaries, so I lashed out. I reminded her that I was an adult now and could make my own decisions. I told her that I wasn\u2019t looking for her advice or opinion but rather I was telling her my plans.\n\nMy mom then started accusing me of being rude and said that I was acting like I \u201coutgrew her.\u201d I got more annoyed at this stage, so I told her (maybe a bit dumb of me) that I probably had outgrown her and that going to some backwater town to watch bison didn\u2019t appeal to me anymore. I said some other things, and I\u2019m pretty sure at that stage, she started crying. She said that I should have told her earlier that I didn\u2019t want to come home instead of getting her hopes up. She also accused me of being uncaring towards her.\n\nMy dad later called and said that he heard from my mom about our conversation that he thought I was unbelievably disrespectful towards her and that I had to apologize and that I should have spoken with them first before coming to a decision.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE - So my dad just texted me. He wants me to explain to my younger siblings why I won't be coming home. I told him that I thought he and my mom already explained to them that I had planned something else, but he texted me back: \"Since you are a responsible adult, you should be taking the initiative of letting your brother and sisters know that you don't want to come home over the holidays\".\n\nUPDATE 2 - I've booked another flight for the 21st, I didn't want to have to tell my siblings that I wasn't showing up.\n\nUPDATE 3 - I ended up apologizing to my mom and told her I'd be coming over.

Imagine you had planned to go and spend time with John and Kate, and the plans were made some months ago. Not only that, but they were going to house you and feed you for free! They'd even planned activities to do with you, and were SO excited to see you after many months of not being able to hang out with you. \n\nNow think about how impossibly rude it would be to cancel your flight to see them the *day before* you were supposed to go. After they were excited, and spent all that time preparing for you to come. \n\nAnd then imagine they Still want to see you, despite how incredibly rude you've been - they ask for you to just visit a little, because they miss you! \n\nAnd you have the Audacity to act *annoyed*. \n\nYou wanna be an adult?

You could have taken a little time to be kind to your family, but you didn't bother, and chose to be deliberately nasty instead.\n\nIt's understandable that you enjoy the excitements available in a big city, and you like socialising with your new friends rather than going home to your family and being bored.

This is a normal, healthy thing to do when the other person upsets you and cancels plans last minute.

You canceled important plans with your family when something more fun came up. If this is what you want to do, then by all means, do it.

You are being supported financially and emotionally by your family. That doesn't mean they're entitled to your visits but an adult would understand it's common decency to spend time with your support system unless they are actively hurting you. An adult would also not put down the life and people that raised them just because they're impressed by a flashy city lifestyle.\n\nAn adult would also understand that friends come and go, but a family who loves you is not only a gift but a more stable relationship you have to nurture.\n\nYou acting like a child because you are a child.
