You're paying for it, it's your guest list. The compromise of an enormous reception is generous of you. The reception is most of the \"wedding\" anyway, outside of super religious ceremonies I don't remember the actual ceremony for any wedding I've been to as the highlight. I get that they have cultural and social obligations that are important to them, but their child should come first.", "NTA. You are paying for it and you are not asking anything from them.", "NTA!! You don't need everyone at your wedding. It's your decision, don't budge. Your compromise was amazing.", "Wow, 3000,  I thought my parents guest list of 300 was nuts. It\u2019s cultural for us too and my parents were the ones who were enthusiastic about the exact idea you had - my introverted American partner gets his dream wedding ceremony with only closest friends in Greece, my parents get their big reception a month later. I put money towards both \ud83d\ude05 since I also do want some aspects of the reception and some control. Your parents are being difficult. When my mom gets pushy I remind her she can\u2019t have the wedding without the bride. Let them know it\u2019s this compromise or nothing. Or he\u2019ll, just plan and throw it yourself first while they plan the giant one. Not only NTA but realistically they can\u2019t stop you and you do have some leverage since you\u2019re the guest of honor for their event.", "100% NTA.\n\nIt's YOUR wedding.  I think you have made great compromise by allowing them the reception,  and you are paying for your own wedding.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding and letting them throw a reception on a different day is very reasonable. Your wedding should be pleasing to you.", "NAH. I can understand your parents who see themselves caught up in cultural expectations where it appears to be customary to wed their children off in large ceremonies, but you're not asking them to contribute financially and as long as you and your partner are on the same page, I believe it is fully your own decision and wish you the best for your wedding and future.", "NTA! Its your big day and so gracious of you to even offer that they hold a reception on another day with who they want.

On the one hand you have your own desires and on the other, generations of societal expectations and parents who wish to perpetuate it, and also don't wish to lose face by hosting what they consider to be a substandard celebration for their daughter's wedding.\n\nWould it be possible for you to elope and then have a big wedding to your family's standard? Is that a possibility?\n\nI have to go with NAH. I do understand that you feel crushed under the weight of their hope, while they are frightened of not meeting social obligations that, to them, are very important.", "NTA. You\u2019re paying for it, it\u2019s your wedding and it\u2019s your choice. I understand your predicament though - I\u2019m guessing your parents are either South Asian or Middle Eastern? It\u2019s really hard breaking norms established by your family as a second gen immigrant kid and you\u2019re going to piss your parents off, but it\u2019s your life at the end of the day.", "NTA, perfectly good compromise.

You get to decide, especially since you\u2019re paying for it.

NTA", "NTA- hold your ground!", "*I wouldn't be able to enjoy my wedding.*\n\nI am going to let you in on a little secret. No one really enjoys their wedding. Even 100 people is a lot of people to invite to dinner. Most people are stressed and rushed and the food is never that great and you never really get to talk to anyone.\n\nCan you compromise?\n\n* Have a tiny wedding you and the spouse and 4-10 people? \n* Afterwards have the big party your parents want knowing that you two are already married?\n* Have a small wedding with 100 people and a cocktail hour and then do the big party?\n\nIf you do it your way your parents are never going to let it go. If you do it their way you are still married to the love of your life. \n\nEveryone on here will tell you it is your wedding do whatever you want. You get to decide, but you know as well as I this is more than just upsetting your parents for one event this is casting a shadow on them. Every relative who wasn't invited will be complain. Every neighbor who thought they were going will feel insulted. And when they say, \"but our child wouldn't let us,\" everyone will give them side eye.\n\nYou do get to do whatever you want, but you will also have to live with the consequences.", "Nta but would they be against 2 wedding in general 1 that you want paid by you then one big one not just a reception? If they are then just being picky. It your wedding do as you like.\n\n\nIf they are fine with this do you have a preference which would be first would you want the intimate one first or the big one. You could also have them months or a year apart so it's much easier. \n\nI understand your parents but it's not there wedding and this would be a great alternative because you get what you want and they get what they want. Because the alternative is just you get what you want. And that only sucks for them.", "The thing is the first line is simply not true in a lot of cultures. Weddings are not about the couple, they are about the families. I agree with OP being NTA, just wanted to highlight where the disconnect stems from.", "It's hilarious. In almost all the weddings I have attended, most people are more focused on getting seat to eat in the first group (so many guests that food has to be served in groups of 200 +, atleast 3 groups), than seeing the wedding ceremony. Less than 20% of invited guests see the actual wedding ceremony \ud83e\udd23", "True, and I appreciate the kind way you called out the cultural ignorance of my blanket statement... I suppose it sort of comes down to what's more important to the couple; honoring their culture or honoring their love and the nuances of their relationship? No doubt both are important, but I know that if I tried to make my fianc\u00e9 do some giant traditional wedding, he wouldn't feel like it was about him at all and it would hurt our relationship... granted I don't have any cultural expectations on me, so that's pretty easy for me to say... Overall, I'm guessing that for many, coming out the gate with one or both parties getting married feeling like they're less important than the wedding itself might not be a great way to start a marriage.", "Yeah, I wouldn't imagine that there would be a large enough venue to make sure 1000+ people get a good view of a wedding ceremony outside of a stadium or concert hall. I remember once as a teenager attending a very large and very religious ceremony that lasted over an hour and being so incredibly bored and hungry. I think if you let them have a reception that is just as large and extravagant as they want nobody is going to be mad; they're just being a bit paranoid."]}
