You're paying for it, it's your guest list. The compromise of an enormous reception is generous of you.

I put money towards both \ud83d\ude05 since I also do want some aspects of the reception and some control. Your parents are being difficult.

Your wedding should be pleasing to you.", "NAH. I can understand your parents who see themselves caught up in cultural expectations where it appears to be customary to wed their children off in large ceremonies, but you're not asking them to contribute financially and as long as you and your partner are on the same page, I believe it is fully your own decision and wish you the best for your wedding and future.", "NTA!

NTA", "NTA- hold your ground!", "*I wouldn't be able to enjoy my wedding.*\n\nI am going to let you in on a little secret. No one really enjoys their wedding. Even 100 people is a lot of people to invite to dinner. Most people are stressed and rushed and the food is never that great and you never really get to talk to anyone.\n\nCan you compromise?\n\n* Have a tiny wedding you and the spouse and 4-10 people? \n* Afterwards have the big party your parents want knowing that you two are already married?\n* Have a small wedding with 100 people and a cocktail hour and then do the big party?\n\nIf you do it your way your parents are never going to let it go. If you do it their way you are still married to the love of your life. \n\nEveryone on here will tell you it is your wedding do whatever you want. You get to decide, but you know as well as I this is more than just upsetting your parents for one event this is casting a shadow on them. Every relative who wasn't invited will be complain. Every neighbor who thought they were going will feel insulted.

If they are then just being picky. It your wedding do as you like.\n\n\nIf they are fine with this do you have a preference which would be first would you want the intimate one first or the big one. You could also have them months or a year apart so it's much easier. \n\nI understand your parents but it's not there wedding and this would be a great alternative because you get what you want and they get what they want. Because the alternative is just you get what you want. And that only sucks for them.", "The thing is the first line is simply not true in a lot of cultures. Weddings are not about the couple, they are about the families. I agree with OP being NTA, just wanted to highlight where the disconnect stems from.", "It's hilarious. In almost all the weddings I have attended, most people are more focused on getting seat to eat in the first group (so many guests that food has to be served in groups of 200 +, atleast 3 groups), than seeing the wedding ceremony. Less than 20% of invited guests see the actual wedding ceremony \ud83e\udd23", "True, and I appreciate the kind way you called out the cultural ignorance of my blanket statement... I suppose it sort of comes down to what's more important to the couple; honoring their culture or honoring their love and the nuances of their relationship? No doubt both are important, but I know that if I tried to make my fianc\u00e9 do some giant traditional wedding, he wouldn't feel like it was about him at all and it would hurt our relationship... granted I don't have any cultural expectations on me, so that's pretty easy for me to say... Overall, I'm guessing that for many, coming out the gate with one or both parties getting married feeling like they're less important than the wedding itself might not be a great way to start a marriage.", "Yeah, I wouldn't imagine that there would be a large enough venue to make sure 1000+ people get a good view of a wedding ceremony outside of a stadium or concert hall. I remember once as a teenager attending a very large and very religious ceremony that lasted over an hour and being so incredibly bored and hungry. I think if you let them have a reception that is just as large and extravagant as they want nobody is going to be mad; they're just being a bit paranoid.", "NTA.  Someone has to stop this tradition that no one seems to like except the parents. Might as well be you. Don't let your parents bully you. If and when you have kids, you can stand up to your parents and let your kids have the wedding THEY want (big or little).", "NTA. Have the wedding day that you want. Don\u2019t let them have their way and cause you to look back on your wedding day with regrets.", "I'm going to go with NAH. The truth is, in a lot of cultures the wedding isn't one person marrying another, it's a union of two families. This is something your family has grown up with and been expected of them and they expect it going forward. Family is very important in many cultures and in some cultures family's valued higher than in other cultures. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, it's just the way it's been. However if you now live in a westernized society, you're values don't necessarily match that of your parents and those before them when it comes to weddings, or anything else.\nYou have the right for your wedding to be the way you want it to be, but at the same time your parents have raised you and taken care of you your entire life and having a big extravagant wedding is part of that raising and celebration of you. \nFrom both sides of the fence, I think having a small wedding and a big reception is a good compromise, I have no idea who you are but I'm proud of you for drawing this line. I tried and failed when I got married.", "I think the answer depends a lot on where you are located, and how embedded you still are in the extended culture.\n\nAll those people whose weddings you\u2019ve attended over the years have a reasonable cultural expectation of reciprocity. You went to their party, ate their food, maybe drank their booze, used the occasion to catch up with relatives. Now you're refusing to extend the same courtesy to them.\n\nNow, if your family has moved to somewhere like North America or Western Europe, maybe your partner is from a different background, and these big weddings are the only real tie you have to your parents culture you can make a reasonable choice to cut that tie. You should probably plan on not attending other people\u2019s weddings in the future.\n\nIf you\u2019re still fully embedded in your parent\u2019s culture or living somewhere it\u2019s a dominant community then you would be the asshole for taking part when it\u2019s convenient and ignoring your responsibilities to give back when it\u2019s your turn. You would possibly also be burning more long term social capital than you appreciate", ">Everyone on here will tell you it is your wedding do whatever you want\n\n\n\nBut that is right. \n\n\nYou are asking Op to suck it up essentially and have a miserable day just so their parents will he alright. This is a huge ask. This is real life. This is a wedding they will remember for the rest of their life. \n\nYou ask Op to compromise. They already did.", "This is a thing in Indian culture, for example. A semi-legitimate reason why parents might be upset is that social networks are a much bigger thing in a low-trust culture without a social safety net. From the parents point of view the couple is taking hard-won social capital and setting it on fire.  And this then means (from their point of view) that the new couple will have fewer opportunities and connections down the line. The other reason of course is that massive spending enhances your prestige in the community.  \n\nThat said, I'm totally on OP's side here- especially as she's said that she is willing to go with a big reception.", "That's not how weddings in our culture function though (I think OP is desi but even if she isn't desi weddings often have these many people). People don't sit around and wait for the bride and groom. We go and pay our respects to the couple, give them the gifts and then mingle. Weddings are often the time to catch up with relatives you won't see till the next wedding. It's essentially a giant party. There are snacks before dinner. No one goes hungry\n\nI get OP has a dim view of people being interested in the food, but I honestly don't get it. There will always be people who attended from far away and need to leave earlier. So it makes sense they want to eat early. The hosts will usually encourage them to do so. I get it's not OP's thing, but I personally don't see what's wrong with it", "Exactly. OP was willing to meet halfway which is precisely why it's NTA and not NAH in my opinion. I remember when my cousin and her dad were negotiating on guests (nowhere close to this post's drama) but as it stood, cousin's dad had attended a loooot of people's (friends, family and colleagues) kids' weddings. So he was obligated to return the favor. And in our culture it's the parents who host the wedding. Even if the couple want to pay for their own smaller wedding, that isn't taken well, especially if the parents' have the means to pay more.\n\nIs it unnecessarily complicated? Yes. But that is how our parents' society functions and they _will_ face the heat if they deviate from tradition. That said, OP did offer a fair compromise which could be spun to alleviate 90% of this mess. So yeah, NTA", "Nta, sounds like you're bucking a cultural norm. Its harmless, tho. Let auntie whoever say whatever they want about the wedding and get on with your life", "Tell them tough shit it's your wedding and you'll have it the way you want it , NTA", "NTA - culture aside you aren\u2019t comfortable with a large wedding. Culture and traditions are important but there are limits. Enjoy your culture and traditions but times change. We have had a global pandemic in the last 5 years. A lot of places/people made new traditions around that. \n\nTradition is peer pressure from dead people.", "2000 is like the norm in my culture, you basically invite anyone and everyone you know", "Many people actually enjoy their wedding actually, maybe not the preparation tho.", "I won't elope. I want a beautiful wedding. I want ceremonies, dressing up, laughs and tears. I just want people who know me personally and well to be present. The people who were always with me in all my ups and downs. The people in my family WhatsApp group who sent long audio messages to console me when I failed an exam or tell me how proud of me they are when I achieved something.", "I am desi / Indian. My view about food is about the fact most people don't view the ceremony. If they don't care enough to watch, \"the most magical moment of my life\" and share it with me, I don't get why I have to invite them. Providing lunch in celebration is something I get. And I would much rather do multiple lunches in small groups so we can properly meet and greet everyone, rather than stand on stage and give handshakes to hundreds of people in such a rush that faces blur together and I can't remember what we talked about. \n\nAgain, in my compromise I am letting my parents throw the gigantic reception and do the whole handshake, provide food, meet and greet thing. I just don't want that part to ruin my actual moments in wedding. I want to focus on me, my fiance, my family . I want to remember each look and smile and not just in photos. I want to be goofy and romantic and not care who is watching. I want love there instead of the grandeur and the crowd."]}
