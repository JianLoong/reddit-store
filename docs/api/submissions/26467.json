This is great but my sister is terrified of dogs. She was chased by a very angry dog when she was younger and our cousin locked her in a room with their hyper dog some time after which made it a lot worse. She didn\u2019t want to get the dog but everyone (her husband, kids, and even a therapist said something) pressured her into putting her needs aside for her child. \n\nThe wording they used pissed me off because my sister does everything for her kids and they were acting like she\u2019s a shitty mom because she can\u2019t handle dogs.\n\nShe tried for 3 months. This specific dog is very calm and he\u2019s a sweetie but my sister cannot handle it. She doesn\u2019t have any plans on sending it back but she cannot be home alone with the dog otherwise she\u2019ll pass out from the fear and she\u2019s always shaking when it\u2019s in the same room as her. She\u2019s cried to me many times about how she can\u2019t sleep or do anything but she\u2019s too afraid of putting her foot down because she doesn\u2019t want to upset her family. \n\nPlease keep in mind, she did talk to a therapist regarding her fear but they kept trying to jump to the exposure part and she couldn\u2019t take it.\n\nNow she came to my house yesterday at around 11pm crying because her kids decided to prank her. She sleeps with the room door locked but forgot this once and while she was sleeping, her kids opened the door let the dog in. They then closed the door. Yeah. My sister doesn\u2019t really sleep anymore so she sensed the dog in minutes and ran out. Her husband thought it was hilarious and her kids were calling her crazy so she left. \n\nShe was inconsolable and passed out from exhaustion. \n\nHer phone was ringing while she slept and i was going to ignore it but I figured her husband was making sure she\u2019s okay so I answered. First thing he says? \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2026 it\u2019s a fucking dog.\u201d After I informed him that I was on the phone and his wife was asleep, he told me to wake her up and send her home. I said she\u2019d be staying at my house tonight which pissed him off and he was all like \u201cyou guys are acting like the kids did something horrible, it was a joke.\u201d I was over it and told him \u201cthe kids did do something horrible to their own mother but considering your attitude and the way you treat her, I\u2019m not surprised they barely respect her. Great kids you\u2019re raising, care more about a fucking dog than their own mother.\u201d\n\nWell apparently he was on speaker and the kids heard. He asked me if I was happy now and if I\u2019m proud of myself for shitting on my niece and nephews before hanging up. He then texted me on my phone and he wants me to apologize to his kids and send his wife home. It\u2019s been a few days, my sister\u2019s too anxious to go home so I haven\u2019t forced her to leave. Also, I don\u2019t want to apologize.

It\u2019s a fucking dog\u201d to his wife, but when you call him out he acts like you are the problem because the kids are there and it\u2019s on speakerphone????\n\nSo treating mom like crap and profanity is fine coming from his mouth, but you using profanity is frowned upon?\n\nHe needs a long hard look in the mirror there. And your sister should not go home until the dog is gone. Frankly, I don\u2019t think she should go home at all, ever, but absolutely not until the dog is gone.", "I'm trying to be polite what I say about her family.....no...can't say it politely. \n\nNTA.    Let them see how funny it is when she doesn't go home for a few weeks.", "NTA OP, Thank you for being a compassionate and supportive sibling. Your sister's husband and apparently her kids are narcissistically selfish, cruel and and void of empathy. They are laughing at the pain of  their mother/wife; that is NOT love. Your sister did not marry a good man & the children are following his example. Edit to add: You don't owe an apology for the truth. They owe your sister sincere apologies.", "NTA. Well done for sticking up for your sister. The kids can\u2019t really be blamed for copying their dad\u2019s behavior at this point, but we all can blame HIM. Your sister had to relive her trauma, which she clearly didn\u2019t process completely yet, and therefore it is not just a joke.\n\nThere is no way her husband cares about your sister. In my most positive view, he has no knowledge whatsoever on trauma or PTSS, but honestly, can anybody be this ignorant? He even knows she goed to freaking therapy! Does he not see the visceral reactions of her body? Does he not care, at all?\n\nI hope your sister realizes that her husband doesn\u2019t care about her as much as she thought, and acts accordingly. In no way are you going to apologize, they all should apologize to her.", "NTA, how are you \"shitting\" on them? They all sound like AHs", "NTA. \n\n They shouldn't have gotten a dog with someone in the house that afraid of one.  There are many other pets he could have gotten other than a dog.  It doesn't matter how calm the dog is.\n\nThe kids should have it explained just how hard this is for your sister, and that pranking someone based on their fears is unacceptable\n\nHer husband is an AH for ignoring her fears and encouraging the kids\n\nIt isn't your fault you were on speaker, you didn't know.", "NTA I hope your sister gets a divorce and I hope you're equipped to protect her in case you get unwanted visitors.", "NTA. Abuse is abuse no matter how old the abuser. Maybe the children will recognize how hurtful their actions have been, and that all actions have consequences.", "NTA I wouldn't be surprised if your sister has had to put up with a lot of bullshit \"jokes\" from her husband and he is setting an awful example to the kids too.  \n\n\nThis is emotional abuse, what they did.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds like she has PTSD.  Yeah,  using that to prank her is absolutely beyond the pale,  and it seems like neither the kids nor the husband really understand how serious this is.   \n\nThat being said,  the wording you used wasn't good.   The dog deserves love and protection.  So does the mom.   The dog doesn't deserve to be used as a weapon or a tool in a prank.   What the kids did wasn't just bad for the mother,  it was also bad for the dog.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour sister's fear isn't healthy,  but the kids and the husband (and the therapist,  it seems) are idiots just throwing her into the deep end like that.      Working through a deeply ingrained phobia or trauma trigger like that requires a lot of very slow,  very controlled exposure therapy.    It's not something that can happen overnight.  I certainly wouldn't just bring a dog into the home and expect her to get over it.   It's not fair to her and it's not fair to the dog.", "NTA. Phobias aren\u2019t rational and what they did was cruel.", "Nta but her husband sure is she needs to put her foot down and say I\u2019m not coming back until the dog is gone her kids need to realise actions like that have consequences", "NTA - her husbands a jackass and why the fuck would he call to scold his wife on speakerphone without informing anyone?", "I HATE pranks; they are cruel.\n\nYou are NTA.  Your sister's family needed to hear what a negative impact they are having on her mental health.", "NTA but it's complicated... I don't think you were wrong to say what you said, but it's also not age-appropriate to expect teenagers to have a ton of empathy for adults' mental health issues, especially if they have a parent who is modeling a lack of empathy for them. Pranking people with something they're afraid of is a common trope in media and on YouTube. I doubt the kids actually understand how much suffering this caused their mother. They'll feel awful about it later in life when they've hit the age where they realize their parents are people too, but as teenagers it's normal for them to still assume adults, especially parents, have everything worked out and don't go through the same intense feelings that they do.\n\nThe problem here is your sister's husband being a shitty husband and shitty father. The kids should have been disciplined for the prank in a way that would help them develop in the direction of being kind and thoughtful adults someday. Instead he emotionally abused their mother in front of them, setting the example that it's wrong to be harmed rather than wrong to do harm. \n\nI suggest taking your sister to see a new therapist and a divorce attorney. It doesn't sound like her home is safe for her to return to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For this the dog can not be at the house. It needs to be in neutral territory.  The fact that the dog is in the house means they have probably made her PTSD/fear/trauma worse. \nThe fact her therapist pushed her to let this happen, he either has no clue how deeply this runs, or he has no clue how to deal with this kind of trauma. Either way she needs a different therapist. \n\nTo bring a dog into the house before she is ready is not fair to anyone. Her, the family or the dog. \nI hope you continue to let her stay with you. Maybe, hopefully one day she can go back home, but at this point I would say it\u2019s going to be a while. \n\nYour NTA, the dad set the tone for the conversation and you had no knowledge that the kids were listening in.   If nothing else the kids need to be sat down, you can talk to them about the words you used, and let them know that \u201cwhile dad doesn\u2019t think this is a big deal and you\u2019re taking your direction from him, the truth is that mom has had really bad experiences with dogs and this is a fear she can\u2019t control. And here are some steps that we can do to work towards mom working through this and it\u2019s something that takes time. And forcing the issue is going to reset any progress.\u201d  Give them some tips. Help them see that they have had fears and it\u2019s not always rational, but they still want their fears to be respected. And so they need to respect moms fears.   \n\nThankfully she has a sibling like you that will be her advocate and stand up for her.", "Oh yes I totally get that! It\u2019s sad to see that they don\u2019t take their mother\u2019s feelings serious. Has she explained to them how she really feels? It sounds like she doesn\u2019t stand her ground much (so I applaud her for staying with you!), and that her husband is very dismissive of her, and the kids have learned to mimic his behavior.\n\nCould you alone have a conversation with just the kids, to see if they can understand? It will be easier for them to do so without their father present. Also, they will feel guilty once they realize what they\u2019ve done, so it\u2019s easier for them to side with dad on the \u201cjust a joke\u201d part. And it sounds like that\u2019s how they\u2019re brought up. (Mom\u2019s feelings don\u2019t matter.)", "she should divorce him", "She tries. But her kids will call her ridiculous and say \u201cits just a dog, hes so sweet!\u201d She just gives up because they don\u2019t take her seriously. My sister isn\u2019t someone that gets angry but I really wish she\u2019d just let it all out. The kids need to hear how much they\u2019re hurting her.\n\nI could have a conversation with them, but I\u2019m not the most gentle or kind. I think they need a bit of a harsher lesson but my sister wouldn\u2019t want that. I\u2019ll have to talk to her but she\u2019s just so tired and sleeps most of the day away."]}
