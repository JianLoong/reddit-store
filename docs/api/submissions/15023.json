Excluded previously due to character limit, and I didn't think it was important, but some people beg to differ, so \ud83e\udd37\n\nedit 2: moving edit 1 up here and answering questions:\n\n \\-The food choice is because I live in a smaller area that doesn't have much, but I am looking into local options now. Mac n' cheese is included for the kiddos.\n\n\\-The groom's entire family is invited (excluding one member for his personal reasons), but his family only consists of himself and 6 other people. He doesn't have any friends (except for the ones we share- who were his first- but they're also invited)\n\nEdit 1: the information slip is not also the invite. I have revised the information slip, using advice from many of you, but Mostly from \" [**heidismiles**](https://www.reddit.com/user/heidismiles/) \" and \" [**DoesTheOctopusCare**](https://www.reddit.com/user/DoesTheOctopusCare/) \", thank you so much! It now reads \"\n\n*This event will be held at a church, and semi-formal attire is recommended. The wedding colors are blue, purple, light pink, champagne and black, and guests are invited but not required to join in dressing in these colors.*\n\n*A children's area will be provided, and families are welcome to have their children in the area at any time during the day.*\n\nWe do not have room for additional guests or plus-ones, sorry! \\[this font should be matching the rest sorry\\]\n\n*McAlister\u2019s will be provided: Mac n\u2019 cheese, soup, salad, fruit, chips, variety sandwiches, brownies, and cookies. If you have any allergies or food intolerance, please let us know at (xxx) xxx-xxxx.*\n\n*Drinks will include Water, Lemonade, Diet Lemonade, Sweet Tea, Unsweet Tea, Coke, Diet Coke, Dr. Pepper, Diet Dr. Pepper, Sprite, Sprite Zero, and Root Beer. Driving directions: ...*\"\n\nI am going to share this with Jess tonight and see what she thinks :)\n\nOriginal post-\nI have just finished my \"information\" slip for my wedding- rules, food, driving directions. I made a copy for everyone attending but showed my grandma (Jess) first. She became very upset, saying it's too many rules, but when I said that most of the slip was about the food, she told me that I'm being a bitch about the rules. This is what the slip says:\n\n\"This event is semi-formal at the church, and guests are requested to wear blue, purple, light pink, champagne, or black. Please be mindful that the reception will mostly be outside (grass), so flats/sneakers are advised to be brought as well, for your comfort\" - The top line is only a request. That is the color scheme and I wanted to include it in case anyone wanted to match, but I've already told people that if they wanted to wear a bright red dress or lime green tux, I really don't care.\n\n\"No white attire, excluding shoes/accessories. Guests wearing white attire will be asked to leave or change. If a refusal is made, the guest will be escorted from the event.\"\n\n\"Children are expected to behave and not interrupt the ceremony/first dance. If a child is being disruptive, please take them outside for a breather\"- There is a children's area just for the kids, but if a parent wanted their child with them, this is for that parent\n\n\"No proposals/Pregnancy announcements. Attempts will result in the guest(s) being removed from the event.\u201d\n\n\"Plus-ones are discouraged due to the size of the brides' family, however if you would like to add someone to your invitation, please first let the bride/groom know with your party's head count\" - I tried to include some humor, but she also was offended by this line. I have an enormous family, and I don't have enough money to provide food for that many people, so I only invited immediate family/close friends/and people contributing to the event. I also invited their partners as well (For example, I'm inviting my great aunt, and her partner along with it- or another would be that I'm inviting my younger brothers, so I included their siblings and parents as well. (about 60 people total, including bridesmaids/groomsmen)\n\nThe bottom half of the slip is food/drink, mine and my husband's phone numbers, and the driving directions.\n\nI'm considering rewording some things (I feel like I worded it badly), and maybe separating it into 1 slip each-rules, food, and driving directions. My husband and coworkers (Haven't told anyone else) are saying I should only change Jess's slip.\n\nFor extra context, Jess hasn't contributed anything because I don't want her to. (She helped me out a lot with furniture/appliances when I got my first apartment, and I've just finished paying her back).\n\nAITA for my wedding rules?", "created_utc": 1681742382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pj00i/aita_for_my_wedding_rules/", "score": 2307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA. It\u2019s off-putting. I know you are probably trying to cover all your bases so your wedding goes \u201cperfectly\u201d but the way this is worded is so harsh. I don\u2019t think you need to explain basic conduct at a wedding, but if you really feel like you need to tell your guests what to do, make it nicer. \n\nEx. If you really don\u2019t care if someone is wearing lime green, why word it like that? Try \u201cAll colours of wedding attire welcome! Efforts to wear wedding theme colours (black, champagne, purple, blue) are appreciated. \n\nEx. \u201cThere will be a child\u2019s play area for children who need a break from sitting quietly.\u201d", "YTA. \n\nThis is entirely too much, and confusing as well - you have a recommended color scheme, but you're actually fine with any color? Why even include that then? \n\nPlus ones aren't allowed, except maybe they are, just ask the bride and groom first? \n\nThen the rules that actually seem to be rules are written in a rather insulting manner. \n\nIf I got this as part of a wedding invitation, I would decline - not because I couldn't follow the rules, but because I'd be insulted that someone thinks I need all of this spelled out for me. \n\nNot to mention, if you're inviting people who actually need these reminders, they're not going to read those rules in the first place, much less follow them. \n\nPlease ditch this whole idea.", "YTA. \nThe slip should read:\n\u201cThe wedding colors are XYZ if anyone wants to wear them. A kids play zone is being provided and wine available during the ceremony and reception. Since the venue is outside, feel free to wear comfortable shoes\u201d\n\nSame information, not a single \u201crule\u201d. Comes across much kinder", "YTA - the way they are even written is entitled. I\u2019d just not go to your wedding after reading this.", "YTA. Grandma Jess ftw! If you\u2019re purposefully trying to cut down on your guest list to save money then this will definitely do it for you. Enjoy your 25% capacity wedding cause like everyone else has said who would want to go to a wedding with that many rules. Not even your own grandma wants to go!", "If you don't care what anyone wears why do you feel the need to request colors? The whole thing screams Bridezilla. If it were me and I received this I would send a blender and not go.\n\nEdit YTA", "YTA. If I received this invite I\u2019d just stay home. Sorry but holy crap. These are grown adults, they don\u2019t need to be told what colors to wear or what shoes to have on. If kids misbehave at the event, you have a bridesmaid quietly handle the situation by showing them a place for the kids to calm down. You assume no one is going to wear white to your wedding and if they do, you come here to Reddit and complain afterwards like a normal human. You don\u2019t have a laundry list of expected behavior and dress. It\u2019s rude.", "YTA. Your grandma is spot on. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t requiring the color scheme be followed, don\u2019t mention it. Kids being quiet is obvious. No one brings a kid to a wedding and asks them to make a crap ton of noise. At most, you can tell people AT the reception \u201ca Children\u2019s area is available in case your little ones need a breather.\u201d \n\nThe white thing, no plus-ones (that weren\u2019t specifically invited) and no announcements are other obvious ones that any functioning adult would know without being told. \n\nYour \u201crules\u201d read as you LOOKING for reasons to have your guests escorted out by security. Which, does not give a \u201cwe are so excited to have you celebrate with us\u201d vibe.  However, if your goal is to cut down on attendees, proceed with your rules.

But the length, wording, and inclusion of things that are common knowledge and common soured pushes you into AH territory. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d keep the bit about semi formal, take out the stuff about the colors, keep the bit about grass reception, take out the bit about white (people already know not to wear white to a wedding), change the kid bit to \u201ca childrens area will be provided for those who need it,\u201d remove the announcements bit, and keep the plus one bit.", "Wow! That\u2019s insane", "YTA a printed list of rules? If you think your guests don\u2019t know how to behave at a wedding then don\u2019t invite them.

I would rsvp no, not send a gift and have a laugh at your expense.\n\nEdit. Read your update. You are still doing way too much. Listing the damn menu?  Wtf", "Yeah YTA \n\nA lot of those things are just unnecessary and frankly it\u2019s condescending and sounds like you don\u2019t trust your guests.", "INFO - what does it say about food and drink?", "YTA\n\nThis is a wedding, not the Coronation.\n\nIf you don't care about the colors except for white (which most people know), why mention it? This isn't prom, who cares to match your colors.\n\nAre you having security to escort the offenders or your rules?\n\nIf there is a particular parent/child you are worried about, talk to them.", "Soft YTA. After all, your wedding, your rules. BUT you want people to be comfortable. So this really does need re-wording. For example: Our colour scheme is xxx so we would love for our guests to wear (colour list) if they choose to do so. \n\n(Clearly you can probably do words better than me!). Have rules, just make them friendlier.\n\nHave your wedding be a happy memory for everyone involved. And have fun with it yourself. It's about love and acceptance.", "If this is real? And I don\u2019t doubt that it is! It\u2019s silly and insulting to your guests. Parents who bring small children to a wedding don\u2019t need to be told they should behave. Or that they should be brought outside if they can\u2019t during the ceremony. That\u2019s not your beat. \n\nLeading off with what people should wear sets the tone. And if you mean that people are free to match your wedding colors if they\u2019d like? Say that. And say it buried somewhere in the letter.\n\nAnd announcing that you\u2019re going to have a bouncer remove anyone wearing white? Also unnecessary. I have never been to a wedding and seen someone wearing white. Why are you scared this will happen? And don\u2019t you think you could probably survive it if it did? \n\nYour statement about +ones makes you sound cheap and ungracious. Also unnecessary. If you didn\u2019t invite someone with a plus one? They won\u2019t be bringing someone. Unless you had non-traditional invitations. But either way, don\u2019t say any of this.  And if I got a note like this, I would not go to the wedding. No exaggeration. YTA", "I don't think your an AH for having these rules, I think they are typical wedding etiquette that most people expect, but it's probably a bit OTT to include them in an invite to send out to everyone. \n\nMaybe try simplifying it and rewording. Eg: \"Children are welcome and there is a play park for them to enjoy if they get restless\" is a bit nicer and conveys the same information. I think a lot of this doesn't need to be said though as people should know they don't get a +1 unless told, and not to wear white, etc etc. \n\nSo I'm going to say YTA.", "YTA. I'd read the rules and RSVP my no very quickly.", "YTA, your colors state that it's requested,  not an optional suggestion.  And it is too many rules, granda is spot on.\n\nIf I received this invite I'd pass.", "YTA, because this is worded in a very entitled way, even if the actual requests are not outlandish.

For your comfort we advise you bring flats or sneakers as the reception will be held in a grassy area.\"*\n\nEverything else is redundant/assumed/obvious/implied and saying it makes you sound like an insufferable bridezilla.", "This is a piss-take, right???", "YTA. Most brides would just simply request for certain colors to be worn and that's it. Some would go as far to say that kids are welcome at the reception only, but yours is just too much. If I am one of your friends I'd send you a gift but I would not attend.", "The note is a good idea. But sounds a little rude and includes stuff that\u2019s common sense that\u2019s not needed. Drop the color for dress. Sounds like you don\u2019t really care and that\u2019s just too far.  The stuff about kids is too much. You would be fine to simply say there is a child\u2019s area. You sound confrontational in the letter.   Are you expecting bad behavior. Do you have relatives that usually cause issues. I think you could say most of this in a much nicer way. These are supposed to be your closest family and friends. You are treating them like the opposite with the tone of the letter. YTA.", "Gentle ESH\n\nI think a lot of what is in the slip is common sense or common courtesy. You don't wear white to a wedding, you don't propose at a wedding without permission, and if your kid is being disruptive you handle it.\n\nAs such, including it sounds a little patronizing. Especially when each line ends with \"Break these rules and security is hauling you out!\" THAT is a bit much.\n\nMaybe just say \"Hey, here is the color scheme if you want to match, but it's optional, please just wear semi-formal clothes\" and keep the line about the party being outside so people know as far as shoes. \n\nJess calling you a bitch for it was over the top though.", "I personally have one rule when it comes to attending weddings: don't attend weddings that come with rules.", "YTA\n\nThis is a wedding not a Business meeting.

These are your friends and family, and you're writing this as though they're barbarians who've never been to an event before. \n\nThe first part about the colors and the sneakers is fine.\n\nThe rest could be shortened significantly, if you insist on including it all. DO NOT include any description of punishment for rule-breaking, that's ridiculous.\n\n-----\n\nPlease do not wear white.\n\nPlease take care to not interrupt the First Dance (this includes children). This is important to us.\n\nWe do not have room for additional guests or plus-ones, sorry!", "I'm going with soft YTA.\n\nThe rules come across as heavy handed and likely will not be taken in the context you intend.

A play area for children has been planned so they have an opportunity to do what they do best: be kids.  Please let us know if we have forgotten anyone.\"\n\nThe lines about removal by security comes across as heavy handed and give off strong bridezilla vibes.  Keep it light, positive, and focussed on celebrating your commitment to each other with your friends and family.  \n\nSo go get married, have fun, roll with the punches, and don't lose sight of the fact that you two are getting married.  The rest is just a celebration of that so if it's not perfect, so what?  I attended an outdoor wedding several years ago that started an hour late due to a thunderstorm.  Life happens.  The guests all worked together to dry off the chairs, had a laugh at the shared experience, they got married, and everyone had a good time.  Was it perfect?  No.  Did everyone roll with it?  Yes.  Did everyone have a good time?  Yes.", "It's way too much n convoluted. Comes off as condescending with the phrasing too. Your guests don't need a book on rules that are just mostly common sense. Your guest don't need to know your family is huge and that's why you don't want to give plus ones.\n\nAn earlier post says you're already married to the guy.

Ugh.", "YTA I would 100% decline an invitation to this event, since evidently it\u2019s going to be filled with people who have absolutely no common sense or knowledge of basic etiquette who need to be explicitly told all of these things.", "YTA. I think that reading Reddit makes it seem like these occurrences are much more common than they are. Most people understand common courtesy. If you have someone in your life you are specifically worried about doing one of these things, you should speak to them privately. This comes off as condescending and controlling, and it doesn't make your wedding sound like it would be very enjoyable.\n\nIf you want to be clear that the colors are not mandatory, use the word \"suggest\" instead of \"request\".", "So like, some of the rules are reasonable/unspoken rules for wedding guest behavior, but I think making an entire page full of them and giving them to guests is a bit presumptuous.

Is his family allowed to have significant others attend?", "NAH.... or maybe The softest of YTA..\n\n A lot of people are saying hard YTA but tbh I feel as if I would see this invite and think \"A little much.... but overall reasonable expectations\" and RSVP yes. Though I would think in your attempt to ensure a classy wedding you might have sacrificed some class..\n\nIt is a bit excessive and does feel a bit tight-fisted  so I understand why others are put off. BUT I also truly understand why you include those. You want your day to be perfect and go smoothly, its understandable! But I think some of the advice in these comments would be worth taking into consideration. Like leaving out the punishments and some of the more obvious wedding etiquette rules and trusting your guests to behave. If they don't you could always have a some ushers quietly assigned to handle any unruly behavior that you specify to them privately.  No need to list out those rules in detail and threaten your guests beforehand.", "NTA, but only because you've not shared this with guests and are asking for feedback before sending anything to anyone else (this is a smart thing to do). These rules are far too formal, restrictive, and poorly worded.

I suggest you do this before you go ahead with sending anything to anyone. \n\nI'm not going to go into your decisions about your wedding, but I think maybe consider while writing if you were to verbally explain the rules to a close friend whose opinion you care about, and see if you come up with the same thing?", "Sorry but YTA, some of these are fair but other parts are treating your guests like children who you expect will behave badly. \n\n1.

Otherwise, our event is semi-formal with an outdoor reception on grass.\" \n\nNo white and no proposals/announcements are general knowledge. I know reddit ruins us for this, but I think a quiet word to the family gossips that this is exceptionally not welcome would allow this to take care of itself. The gossips will know who's stupid enough to give this a try. And no one will have a right to be a shocked Pikachu if they get thrown out for this.\n\n\"We have a dedicated children's area so that parents may enjoy the party.\" Then follow up with families with small children to let them know that if a kid is fussy, to please take advantage of this service. Most honestly will, as it's a nice date night without them having to find their own childcare.\n\nWatch your RSVPs and keep a spreadsheet. Cousin Amanda got an invite for just her, but RSVPed for three? You call her and set her straight. It's general knowledge that it's bad form to add people to talk RSVP that aren't on the invitation, so you don't need to scold all your guests. You can just privately scold whoever is that tacky. You can even get your parents involved to help the familial shaming if you need to. Or grandma!\n\nNone of your rules or information are unreasonable, but the wording makes it seem like you think most of your guests are AHs, and not kind people who love you and want you to have a lovely wedding day. Let the AH naturally sort themselves out or have a few quiet conversations with the people you're most concerned about rather than spamming everyone.", "NAH. Rules are fine, but the tone does not make guests feel like they're there to have a good time with you.

I made a copy for everyone attending but showed my grandma (Jess) first. She became very upset, saying it's too many rules, but when I said that most of the slip was about the food, she told me that I'm being a bitch about the rules. This is what the slip says:\n\n\"This event is semi-formal at the church, and guests are requested to wear blue, purple, light pink, champagne, or black. Please be mindful that the reception will mostly be outside (grass), so flats/sneakers are advised to be brought as well, for your comfort\" - The top line is only a request. That is the color scheme and I wanted to include it in case anyone wanted to match, but I've already told people that if they wanted to wear a bright red dress or lime green tux, I really don't care. \n\n\"No white attire, excluding shoes/accessories. Guests wearing white attire will be asked to leave or change. If a refusal is made, the guest will be escorted from the event.\"\n\n\"Children are expected to behave and not interrupt the ceremony/first dance. If a child is being disruptive, please take them outside for a breather\"- There is a children's area just for the kids, but if a parent wanted their child with them, this is for that parent\n\n\"No proposals/Pregnancy announcements. Attempts will result in the guest(s) being removed from the event.\u201d\n\n\"Plus-ones are discouraged due to the size of the brides' family, however if you would like to add someone to your invitation, please first let the bride/groom know with your party's head count\" - I tried to include some humor, but she also was offended by this line. I have an enormous family, and I don't have enough money to provide food for that many people, so I only invited immediate family/close friends/and people contributing to the event. I also invited their partners as well (For example, I'm inviting my great aunt, and her partner along with it- or another would be that I'm inviting my younger brothers, so I included their siblings and parents as well. (about 60 people total, including bridesmaids/groomsmen)\n\nThe bottom half of the slip is food/drink, mine and my husband's phone numbers, and the driving directions.\n\nI'm considering rewording some things (I feel like I worded it badly), and maybe separating it into 1 slip each-rules, food, and driving directions. My husband and coworkers (Haven't told anyone else) are saying I should only change Jess's slip.\n\nFor extra context, Jess hasn't contributed anything because I don't want her to. (She helped me out a lot with furniture/appliances when I got my first apartment, and I've just finished paying her back). \n\nAITA for my wedding rules?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Also a bounce house.", "YTA for Champagne vs White for dresses, honestly. Those are way too close and will cause confusion, and perhaps a person getting escorted out  who honestly thought their dress would be fine. The rest is a bit much too.

Sure you will get a few people who write in extra people, but then you deal with them. \n\nEveryone should know not to make announcements, and the people who don't won't be dissuaded by spelling it out on the invite. \n\nFor children, you should just note that there is a play area for kids. \n\nThen you can include something about attire: Semi formal, reception is on grass/outside so dress accordingly (I'd want to know this) and then \"our wedding colors are X, so we encourage guests to match our theme.\" I've gotten that request before and if I can follow it, then I do, and if I don't have anything in those colors, I note that it was just a suggestion. \n\nThese are all fine rules and information, but they shouldn't be on a wedding invitation because they are commonly understood rules of wedding etiquette.

Yes, it's your wedding and you can have whatever rules you want, but I certainly wouldn't want to go to this wedding. Your grandma is right.\n\nYou don't need to say \"no proposols/wearing white/kids behave/etc.\" This all goes without saying. If someone has no manners, feel free to kick them out, but it doesn't need to be in an information packet.\n\nThe bit about plus ones is super icky. I wouldn't come if I was discouraged from bringing my husband. That's no fun for me, and I'm gonna feel super awkward the whole time. You should want your guests to be comfortable. This is the most AH thing about it. If you invite one single guest, you should give them a plus one. \n\nAlso, there is a way to mention a color scheme without making you seek like a control freak.

I wouldn't go to this wedding after reading that.", "From an etiquette standpoint I think your invitation is way too over the top and condescending. Half the rules (like not wearing white, no proposals, keeping your kids behaved) are already well known social expectations\u2026 it\u2019s unnecessary to list them all out and it just makes it seem like you think your guests are idiots in addition to just making the whole invitation way too long and micromanaging. \n\nThe outfit color request could probably be worded differently too as it will probably rub people the wrong way. It\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s an optional request vs a \u201cmandatory\u201d request. Maybe just indicate the color scheme of the wedding rather than making a specific request. And usually color coordination is only expected from the wedding party, not the guests. \n\nIn other words, the rules themselves don\u2019t make you an asshole. But listing them out like that on the invitation makes does make you sound like one. So soft YTA", "YTA. In one way it's...refreshing that you plan to be upfront about how strict the wedding will be. On the other hand, reading your rules makes me imagine there will be private security hauling off people who offend you.", "People are aware of social rules you don't have to lay it out.

Also, I don't understand this... are you telling people they can, in fact, bring +1's?  Because your wedding will get a whole lot bigger if you include that line.\n\nThe rest is ridiculous.  You are mixing up \"request\" and \"suggestion\", making it impossible for someone to wear a white shirt under a jacket, telling them how to parent, and how to behave at a wedding.  The only part you should be including is the part about shoes.", "I've never been to a wedding or organized a wedding, and most of this seems like common wedding stuff. But like why make rules.

Again I would be glad to know this so that I can wear appropriate attire, and again you aren't saying they can't wear high heels but giving them a heads up of the grounds. \n* Don't bring a plus one unless it's Okayed. Really a plus one shouldn't be brought unless specified on the invite anyway..... \n\nSo to me this is nothing over the top or any kind of extra rules that a person would be flabbergasted to adhere to.

Most of your rules are not too much or unheard off but the way you word them is coming off extremely rude. You should strongly consider rephrasing them because I would find this very off-putting to read. I\u2019ll go over my suggestions in each paragraph: \n\n> \"This event is semi-formal at the church, and guests are requested to wear blue, purple, light pink, champagne, or black. Please be mindful that the reception will mostly be outside (grass), so flats/sneakers are advised to be brought as well, for your comfort\"\n\nThe top line doesn\u2019t read optional. I would feel obligated to wear (buy!) something in this color scheme. How about instead you write \u201cThis event is semi-formal at the church so we ask guests to dress accordingly. The color scheme will be blue, purple, light pink, champagne, and black. Feel free to dress in this colors if you want to.\u201c That makes it clear but is more open. However, I would strike champagne from the list or do you want a discussion if is champagne or ivory and if ivory is counted as white? The second sentence is fine, I appreciate this being mentioned. \n\n> \"No white attire, excluding shoes/accessories. Guests wearing white attire will be asked to leave or change. If a refusal is made, the guest will be escorted from the event.\"\n\nSuper harsh. Everyone should no that, no need to be so upfront about it. Write: \u201cIt goes without saying that we kindly ask you to keep within the usual culturally established rules of weddings (no white attire/proposal/personal announcements etc). Thank you for being considerate.\u201d That goes to the very end of the list. \n\n> \u201cChildren are expected to behave and not interrupt the ceremony/first dance. If a child is being disruptive, please take them outside for a breather\"\n\nGoogle nicer wordings. Something like \u201cWe know that wedding ceremonies can be boring for children. In order to accommodate them, there is a separate children\u2019s area for them to enjoy their time. However, if you would like your child to witness the ceremony and the first dance, we appreciate that but would like to ask you to take them outside for a breather in case they become bored and disruptive.\u201d \n\n> \u201cNo proposals/Pregnancy announcements. Attempts will result in the guest(s) being removed from the event.\u201d\n\nMentioned above.\n\n> \"Plus-ones are discouraged due to the size of the brides' family, however if you would like to add someone to your invitation, please first let the bride/groom know with your party's head count\" \n\nDo I understand it correctly that the partners you want there are mentioned on the invite? In that case just say no Plus Ones, end of story. This will just lead to chaos. But if you want to do that then the line can stay. But include a deadline! I would suggest \u201cThere are no standard Plus Ones, invitees are mentioned on the invitation. In case you would like to add someone important to your invitation, please reach out to the bride and groom to discuss until X.\u201d \n\nMy wording isn\u2019t perfect either but you really need to tone it down, it sounds like you expect the worst from your guests and it sounds extremely unwelcoming.

It\u2019s too much and too strongly worded.\n\nThe color scheme should read more like a fun suggestion and not a requirement. (I also think that some of the lighter colors could look white in certain lighting, so you might want to rethink those colors.)\n\nThe part about plus-ones should probably be removed entirely, but if you want to say something, it should be more of a light hearted apology for not being able to include everyone. If someone feels strongly about it, they can contact you, but I don\u2019t think you actually want to encourage that. Agreeing to add plus ones for some and not others could lead to a lot of hurt feelings.\n\nA lot of those other rules are typical western wedding etiquette and shouldn\u2019t need to be stated.

It's over the top and some of them completely unnecessary. And they are all over the place.\n\nAnd make your family and friends sound like uncouth assholes that have to be told how to behave.  \n\nInformation sheets should have helpful information not instructions and threats. \n\nBanning white is not necessary. Most women understand that white is reserved for the bride. Many men only own white dress shirts as well. That is never considered wrong or insulting to the bride and groom. \nAdditionally three of the colors you indicated can look white depending on lighting. \n\nIf you want to ask the guests to wear your wedding colors using the term \"requested\" sounds kinda over the top and formal. More like a requirement. Especially when combined with the dress code. \n\nYou should probably adjust it and set it up as an FAQ. \n\nIs there a dress code? \n\nThe dress code is semi-formal. \n\nIf you would like to coordinate your outfit with our wedding colors they are blue (might want to indicate a type of blue, big difference between sky blue and navy blue.) Purple (Again are we talking grape purple or some other shade) light pink (Again close to white) and black. \n\nOf course, white is reserved for the bride. (If you feel that people are unaware of this due to perhaps cultural differences) \n\nWe would like our guests to be comfortable all evening so please keep in mind that the reception area is mostly grass and choose your footwear accordingly. \n\nThen close that question with a light note along the lines of... \n\nKeep it colorful and be ready to dance!!! \n\nWhat about the kids? \n\nWe would like this to be a family event so we have provide a children's area with child care. We ask that all parents work with us to keep the ceremony and first dance as distraction free as possible. If you have to leave for a few minutes to calm/quiet a child we completely understand. \n\nCan I make an announcement? Propose? \n(Is this really a valid concern with your friends and family?)\n\nI would leave this one off just instruct whoever is your MC and incharge of any audio video that no one gets the microphone/floor except for those on the schedule. \n\nHowever if this has happened at other family events then you could put. \n\nOur MC is working on a tight schedule and there will not be an appropriate time to work in additional announcements/good news. \n\nWhy didn't I get a plus one? (Again should be unnecessary, plus ones are included in the invitation, if it wasn't on the invitation, for example John Smith and guest, then they don't get a plus one) \n\nWe would love to say the more the merrier but we have had to restrict our guest list to be able to include family and keep things intimate and family focused.\n\nWe tried to include long term partners, affianced people and of course spouses in the invitations. If we missed someone's long term partner please accept our apologies and let us know. \n\n(Again this is usually handled by putting names on the inner envelope of the invitation, so it's clear who is expected and how large of a party is included in the invitation) \n\nEven the food is unnecessary unless they are required to make a choice with the rsvp. And that should be indicated on the RSVP. If you must include it due to concerns about dietary restrictions. Put it under a question like \"What will we be eating?\" \n\nI would also suggest setting up a wedding email for questions concerns, or giving them an e-mail address at the bottom. That way you both can go over any additional requests and decide together. Otherwise you could be each bombarded with questions and asked for immediate answers. \n\nUnless you expect problems, it's very rude to threaten guests with their invitation. \n\nOne slip each rule is ridiculous. \n\nJess doesn't have to have contributed to tell you that your information sheet comes across as a bit of a control freak bridezilla. She is trying to do you a favor and prevent you from insulting your entire family/guest list.", "If I got that essay in the post, unless you were a good friend I would be binning it and saying fuck that noise.\n\nIt cones across as very 'bridezilla'.\n\nYTA with that.

Here are some tips:\n\n* **Do not tell people what to wear** (except for white). I know you're saying that you don't really care, but you didn't say that in the invitation, you're telling us. Telling people what to wear puts a burden on them to change their outfit, buy a completely new outfit, or wear something they don't really like. This is considered a \"dick move\".\n* You made your wedding child friendly, you need to live with the consequences of that. Children are children and are at the whim of their underdeveloped neurons. It is good that you set up a \"child area\" but you again did not specify that in the invitation, you're telling us.\n* It's fine to ban proposals or other upstaging activities, but don't tell guests the punishment. That gives a harsher message than \"Please don't propose, announce pregnancies, or upstage the bride and groom.\"\n* The whole plus one thing is irrelevant. **YOU DECIDE WHO TO INVITE**, your guests do not decide if they want to bring additional people. My partner and I solved this by including how many seats each family/guest have at the wedding. It sends a better message to guests if you say \"You have 1/2 seats available\" rather than \"don't bring anyone else, come alone\".", "YTA - just from the first sentence.. you shouldn't be handing out rules to a wedding. These things are implied. \n\n\\- you're dictating the **COLORS** guests can wear?

Don't allow children to come and then expect them to behave like adults\n\n\\- you're literally listing faux pas as rules. Don't propose, don't wear white, dont tell people you're pregnant... do you think your guests are stupid?\n\n\\- is this a dry wedding? would be an easy skip for me.", "NTA, those are pretty common expectations at a wedding, but they still are violated constantly.

With very few exceptions, if they\u2019re doing either of those things, they\u2019re doing it specifically to be rude at worst or willfully ignorant, selfish, and inconsiderate at best, not because they didn\u2019t understand a rule or because they weren\u2019t explicitly told not to do so. It\u2019s socially unacceptable and if you don\u2019t trust certain friends and family to follow fairly basic and well understood social etiquette at your wedding then I personally would be more inclined to consider uninviting those people than to put a disclaimer in a handout to the whole guest list to keep them in line. So while none of your rules are wrong or unreasonable, I can see where your grandma is coming from a little, she probably meant it more along the lines of that\u2019s a lot of unnecessary words on the page to reiterate things that are pretty well understood and unspoken expectations for attending a wedding. And I could see family members or friends who would have never thought to do any of the bad behaviors feeling a bit talked down to if given that list and may just feel a little weird about receiving it. And also, while totally reasonable consequences for such actions, the threats in multiple lines to kick people out for noncompliance seems like an overly hostile way to immediately start your event.

Where you draw the line where you say \u201cthey don\u2019t qualify\u201d to get a plus one?
