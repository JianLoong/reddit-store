{"id": 15023, "submission_id": "12pj00i", "title": "AITA for my wedding rules?", "selftext": "  I have just finished my \"information\" slip for my wedding- rules, food, driving directions. I made a copy for everyone attending but showed my grandma (Jess) first. She became very upset, saying it's too many rules, but when I said that most of the slip was about the food, she told me that I'm being a bitch about the rules. This is what the slip says:\n\n\"This event is semi-formal at the church, and guests are requested to wear blue, purple, light pink, champagne, or black. Please be mindful that the reception will mostly be outside (grass), so flats/sneakers are advised to be brought as well, for your comfort\" - The top line is only a request. That is the color scheme and I wanted to include it in case anyone wanted to match, but I've already told people that if they wanted to wear a bright red dress or lime green tux, I really don't care. \n\n\"No white attire, excluding shoes/accessories. Guests wearing white attire will be asked to leave or change. If a refusal is made, the guest will be escorted from the event.\"\n\n\"Children are expected to behave and not interrupt the ceremony/first dance. If a child is being disruptive, please take them outside for a breather\"- There is a children's area just for the kids, but if a parent wanted their child with them, this is for that parent\n\n\"No proposals/Pregnancy announcements. Attempts will result in the guest(s) being removed from the event.\u201d\n\n\"Plus-ones are discouraged due to the size of the brides' family, however if you would like to add someone to your invitation, please first let the bride/groom know with your party's head count\" - I tried to include some humor, but she also was offended by this line. I have an enormous family, and I don't have enough money to provide food for that many people, so I only invited immediate family/close friends/and people contributing to the event. I also invited their partners as well (For example, I'm inviting my great aunt, and her partner along with it- or another would be that I'm inviting my younger brothers, so I included their siblings and parents as well. (about 60 people total, including bridesmaids/groomsmen)\n\nThe bottom half of the slip is food/drink, mine and my husband's phone numbers, and the driving directions.\n\nI'm considering rewording some things (I feel like I worded it badly), and maybe separating it into 1 slip each-rules, food, and driving directions. My husband and coworkers (Haven't told anyone else) are saying I should only change Jess's slip.\n\nFor extra context, Jess hasn't contributed anything because I don't want her to. (She helped me out a lot with furniture/appliances when I got my first apartment, and I've just finished paying her back). \n\nAITA for my wedding rules?", "created_utc": 1681742382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pj00i/aita_for_my_wedding_rules/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA. It\u2019s off-putting. I know you are probably trying to cover all your bases so your wedding goes \u201cperfectly\u201d but the way this is worded is so harsh. I don\u2019t think you need to explain basic conduct at a wedding, but if you really feel like you need to tell your guests what to do, make it nicer. \n\nEx. If you really don\u2019t care if someone is wearing lime green, why word it like that? Try \u201cAll colours of wedding attire welcome! Efforts to wear wedding theme colours (black, champagne, purple, blue) are appreciated. \n\nEx. \u201cThere will be a child\u2019s play area for children who need a break from sitting quietly.\u201d", "YTA. \n\nThis is entirely too much, and confusing as well - you have a recommended color scheme, but you're actually fine with any color? Why even include that then? \n\nPlus ones aren't allowed, except maybe they are, just ask the bride and groom first? \n\nThen the rules that actually seem to be rules are written in a rather insulting manner. \n\nIf I got this as part of a wedding invitation, I would decline - not because I couldn't follow the rules, but because I'd be insulted that someone thinks I need all of this spelled out for me. \n\nNot to mention, if you're inviting people who actually need these reminders, they're not going to read those rules in the first place, much less follow them. \n\nPlease ditch this whole idea.", "YTA. \nThe slip should read:\n\u201cThe wedding colors are XYZ if anyone wants to wear them. A kids play zone is being provided and wine available during the ceremony and reception. Since the venue is outside, feel free to wear comfortable shoes\u201d\n\nSame information, not a single \u201crule\u201d. Comes across much kinder", "YTA - the way they are even written is entitled. I\u2019d just not go to your wedding after reading this.", "YTA. Grandma Jess ftw! If you\u2019re purposefully trying to cut down on your guest list to save money then this will definitely do it for you. Enjoy your 25% capacity wedding cause like everyone else has said who would want to go to a wedding with that many rules. Not even your own grandma wants to go!", "If you don't care what anyone wears why do you feel the need to request colors? The whole thing screams Bridezilla. If it were me and I received this I would send a blender and not go.\n\nEdit YTA", "YTA. If I received this invite I\u2019d just stay home. Sorry but holy crap. These are grown adults, they don\u2019t need to be told what colors to wear or what shoes to have on. If kids misbehave at the event, you have a bridesmaid quietly handle the situation by showing them a place for the kids to calm down. You assume no one is going to wear white to your wedding and if they do, you come here to Reddit and complain afterwards like a normal human. You don\u2019t have a laundry list of expected behavior and dress. It\u2019s rude.", "YTA. Your grandma is spot on. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t requiring the color scheme be followed, don\u2019t mention it. Kids being quiet is obvious. No one brings a kid to a wedding and asks them to make a crap ton of noise. At most, you can tell people AT the reception \u201ca Children\u2019s area is available in case your little ones need a breather.\u201d \n\nThe white thing, no plus-ones (that weren\u2019t specifically invited) and no announcements are other obvious ones that any functioning adult would know without being told. \n\nYour \u201crules\u201d read as you LOOKING for reasons to have your guests escorted out by security. Which, does not give a \u201cwe are so excited to have you celebrate with us\u201d vibe.  However, if your goal is to cut down on attendees, proceed with your rules. If I read that, I\u2019d strongly consider RSVP-ing \u201cno\u201d so as to not deal with a bridezilla who\u2019s looking for a way to kick me out.", "Soft YTA. A lot of these are just common courtesy. Most people don\u2019t specifically say \u201cdon\u2019t propose at my wedding.\u201d The guests understand that proposing at a wedding is rude and weird. \n\nIt\u2019s not all bad. But the length, wording, and inclusion of things that are common knowledge and common soured pushes you into AH territory. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d keep the bit about semi formal, take out the stuff about the colors, keep the bit about grass reception, take out the bit about white (people already know not to wear white to a wedding), change the kid bit to \u201ca childrens area will be provided for those who need it,\u201d remove the announcements bit, and keep the plus one bit.", "Wow! That\u2019s insane", "YTA a printed list of rules? If you think your guests don\u2019t know how to behave at a wedding then don\u2019t invite them. What you have submitted is controlling and childish, IMO. When security removes a guest for breaking the rules, how do you think the rest of your event is going to go?", "YTA wtf?  I would rsvp no, not send a gift and have a laugh at your expense.", "Yeah YTA \n\nA lot of those things are just unnecessary and frankly it\u2019s condescending and sounds like you don\u2019t trust your guests.", "INFO - what does it say about food and drink?", "YTA\n\nThis is a wedding, not the Coronation.\n\nIf you don't care about the colors except for white (which most people know), why mention it? This isn't prom, who cares to match your colors.\n\nAre you having security to escort the offenders or your rules?\n\nIf there is a particular parent/child you are worried about, talk to them.", "Soft YTA. After all, your wedding, your rules. BUT you want people to be comfortable. So this really does need re-wording. For example: Our colour scheme is xxx so we would love for our guests to wear (colour list) if they choose to do so. \n\n(Clearly you can probably do words better than me!). Have rules, just make them friendlier.\n\nHave your wedding be a happy memory for everyone involved. And have fun with it yourself. It's about love and acceptance.", "If this is real? And I don\u2019t doubt that it is! It\u2019s silly and insulting to your guests. Parents who bring small children to a wedding don\u2019t need to be told they should behave. Or that they should be brought outside if they can\u2019t during the ceremony. That\u2019s not your beat. \n\nLeading off with what people should wear sets the tone. And if you mean that people are free to match your wedding colors if they\u2019d like? Say that. And say it buried somewhere in the letter.\n\nAnd announcing that you\u2019re going to have a bouncer remove anyone wearing white? Also unnecessary. I have never been to a wedding and seen someone wearing white. Why are you scared this will happen? And don\u2019t you think you could probably survive it if it did? \n\nYour statement about +ones makes you sound cheap and ungracious. Also unnecessary. If you didn\u2019t invite someone with a plus one? They won\u2019t be bringing someone. Unless you had non-traditional invitations. But either way, don\u2019t say any of this.  And if I got a note like this, I would not go to the wedding. No exaggeration. YTA", "I don't think your an AH for having these rules, I think they are typical wedding etiquette that most people expect, but it's probably a bit OTT to include them in an invite to send out to everyone. \n\nMaybe try simplifying it and rewording. Eg: \"Children are welcome and there is a play park for them to enjoy if they get restless\" is a bit nicer and conveys the same information. I think a lot of this doesn't need to be said though as people should know they don't get a +1 unless told, and not to wear white, etc etc. \n\nSo I'm going to say YTA.", "YTA. I'd read the rules and RSVP my no very quickly.", "YTA, your colors state that it's requested,  not an optional suggestion.  And it is too many rules, granda is spot on.\n\nIf I received this invite I'd pass.", "YTA, because this is worded in a very entitled way, even if the actual requests are not outlandish. This could all be just compressed to one/two sentences:\n\n*\"If you'd like to match the wedding party colors, please wear blue, purple, pink or champagne, otherwise the only color we'd like to ask you not to wear is white. For your comfort we advise you bring flats or sneakers as the reception will be held in a grassy area.\"*\n\nEverything else is redundant/assumed/obvious/implied and saying it makes you sound like an insufferable bridezilla.", "This is a piss-take, right???", "YTA. Most brides would just simply request for certain colors to be worn and that's it. Some would go as far to say that kids are welcome at the reception only, but yours is just too much. If I am one of your friends I'd send you a gift but I would not attend.", "The note is a good idea. But sounds a little rude and includes stuff that\u2019s common sense that\u2019s not needed. Drop the color for dress. Sounds like you don\u2019t really care and that\u2019s just too far.  The stuff about kids is too much. You would be fine to simply say there is a child\u2019s area. You sound confrontational in the letter.   Are you expecting bad behavior. Do you have relatives that usually cause issues. I think you could say most of this in a much nicer way. These are supposed to be your closest family and friends. You are treating them like the opposite with the tone of the letter. YTA.", "Gentle ESH\n\nI think a lot of what is in the slip is common sense or common courtesy. You don't wear white to a wedding, you don't propose at a wedding without permission, and if your kid is being disruptive you handle it.\n\nAs such, including it sounds a little patronizing. Especially when each line ends with \"Break these rules and security is hauling you out!\" THAT is a bit much.\n\nMaybe just say \"Hey, here is the color scheme if you want to match, but it's optional, please just wear semi-formal clothes\" and keep the line about the party being outside so people know as far as shoes. \n\nJess calling you a bitch for it was over the top though.", "I personally have one rule when it comes to attending weddings: don't attend weddings that come with rules.", "YTA\n\nThis is a wedding not a Business meeting. If I got this with a wedding invite I'd decline.\n\nYeesh", "YTA. Wow is all I can say about your \u201clist\u201d", "INFO: are your guests a rowdy rugby team or a group of people you deeply dislike?", "Gotta say that if I received that, I\u2019d RSVP \u201cNo.\u201d I don\u2019t have small kids, no pregnancy or engagement announcements from me, wear black to most things, don\u2019t need nor want a plus one\u2026.I\u2019d be rolling my eyes reading your list and would just opt out of what I perceive as drama. \n\nYTA, and Grandma Jess is right.", "YTA\u2014 after all those rules, I wouldn\u2019t want to come to your wedding.", "YTA. These are your friends and family, and you're writing this as though they're barbarians who've never been to an event before. \n\nThe first part about the colors and the sneakers is fine.\n\nThe rest could be shortened significantly, if you insist on including it all. DO NOT include any description of punishment for rule-breaking, that's ridiculous.\n\n-----\n\nPlease do not wear white.\n\nPlease take care to not interrupt the First Dance (this includes children). This is important to us.\n\nWe do not have room for additional guests or plus-ones, sorry!", "I'm going with soft YTA.\n\nThe rules come across as heavy handed and likely will not be taken in the context you intend.  I would lighten it up with something like \"The reception is outdoors on turf so please feel free to wear comfortable footwear.  If anyone cares, the theme colors are...  A play area for children has been planned so they have an opportunity to do what they do best: be kids.  Please let us know if we have forgotten anyone.\"\n\nThe lines about removal by security comes across as heavy handed and give off strong bridezilla vibes.  Keep it light, positive, and focussed on celebrating your commitment to each other with your friends and family.  \n\nSo go get married, have fun, roll with the punches, and don't lose sight of the fact that you two are getting married.  The rest is just a celebration of that so if it's not perfect, so what?  I attended an outdoor wedding several years ago that started an hour late due to a thunderstorm.  Life happens.  The guests all worked together to dry off the chairs, had a laugh at the shared experience, they got married, and everyone had a good time.  Was it perfect?  No.  Did everyone roll with it?  Yes.  Did everyone have a good time?  Yes.", "It's way too much n convoluted. Comes off as condescending with the phrasing too. Your guests don't need a book on rules that are just mostly common sense. Your guest don't need to know your family is huge and that's why you don't want to give plus ones.\n\nAn earlier post says you're already married to the guy. I get wanting to have a ceremony but you're goin overboard when the specialness of the day has already happened. It's just a party now.\n\nYTA", "YTA - Your note is unnecessary and condescending. You clearly don't trust or respect your friends and family enough to believe they will follow basic etiquette without instructions and threats.\n\nIf you think there are actually people on your guest list who would wear white or announce a pregnancy/engagement, then either don't invite those individuals or speak to them specifically ahead of the event. \n\nIf you address your invites correctly then there is no reason to explain how +1's work or why not everyone received one. Again, if you have concerns about specific individuals, speak to them separately. \n\nIf you want people to match the colors - \n\n\"Our wedding colors are \\[whatever they are\\] and guests are welcome to wear those colors in celebration of this special occasion.\"\n\n For invites going to people whose children are invited include an additional note -\n\n\"We are excited to include your children in this special occasion and look forward to celebrating with them. Children are welcome to stay with you during the ceremony and reception; however, to ensure that both you and your children can enjoy the event, we have arranged to have a children's area with \\[babysitters, games, child friendly food, etc./whatever you are doing\\] available for you during the ceremony and reception.\" \n\nI am not sure what you mean by saying the rest of the slip is food/drink - but aside from have a section where people select their choice of meal, I cannot imagine a reasonable need for it.", "YTA.  Sounds like you're a supervisor for a kindergarten field trip.  I'd rsvp no in a heartbeat JUST because of this. Ugh.", "YTA I would 100% decline an invitation to this event, since evidently it\u2019s going to be filled with people who have absolutely no common sense or knowledge of basic etiquette who need to be explicitly told all of these things.", "YTA. I think that reading Reddit makes it seem like these occurrences are much more common than they are. Most people understand common courtesy. If you have someone in your life you are specifically worried about doing one of these things, you should speak to them privately. This comes off as condescending and controlling, and it doesn't make your wedding sound like it would be very enjoyable.\n\nIf you want to be clear that the colors are not mandatory, use the word \"suggest\" instead of \"request\".", "So like, some of the rules are reasonable/unspoken rules for wedding guest behavior, but I think making an entire page full of them and giving them to guests is a bit presumptuous. If you send this, it will be the first faux pas of your wedding.", "YTA. While most of your rules are typical wedding etiquette it\u2019s condescending to write them in an \u201cinformation slip\u201d. It implies that your guests aren\u2019t civil human beings who wouldn\u2019t know how to behave at a wedding unless someone told them. If there are specific people that you are worried won\u2019t behave properly, sit down and have a conversation with them about your concerns or ask someone you trust to keep an eye out for that person\u2019s potential antics and handle it accordingly. Remember your guests are taking time from their schedules to attend your wedding and spending money to get your a gift. Don\u2019t act like you\u2019re doing them some favor by inviting them to your wedding. Show some gratitude.", "YTA, and you need to chill out.\n\nI understand that you want everything to be perfect. It *won't*. The more you listen to the gremlin of It Needs to be Perfect, the less you'll have any room in you for happiness on the day.", "No wedding invitation should include a manual. Jess was right, your \"rules\" are assholish. YTA", "YTA. I suppose you can request people not wear white but this is over the top. You\u2019re treating them like they are all idiots.  Honestly,  if I received this, I\u2019d think this bridezilla is too much drama and decline.", "I really can\u2019t decide a judgement because it is your wedding to do with as you want, you just might have a small turnout from the rules. \n\nEvery wedding invite I\u2019ve gotten has had a color pallets suggestion, no white, please remove disruptions, silence phones, and no surprise announcements on a slip in there with the invite.\n\nThe no plus one thing doesn\u2019t make any sense when people are going to have them they just have to be invited plus ones. \n\nMaybe NAH? Make it less wordy and it won\u2019t feel so demanding, and cut the whole plus one thing to \u201conly those listed on the invite\u201d or something along those lines.", "YTA and the definition of a bridezilla. I wouldn\u2019t go to this wedding if it was my own kids.", "i think NAH. your grandmother isn't wrong that it's a lot, and it's understandable that you want to make sure certain things don't happen at your wedding.\n\nthe bigger question is why are you inviting anyone you're so worried might actually do any of these things that are obviously considered unacceptable at a wedding?", "INFO: You mentioned that you have an enormous family and your side has all their spouses and +1s (and also their spouses parents?). What does the groom get? Does he have an equal number of guests attending? Is his family allowed to have significant others attend?", "NAH.... or maybe The softest of YTA..\n\n A lot of people are saying hard YTA but tbh I feel as if I would see this invite and think \"A little much.... but overall reasonable expectations\" and RSVP yes. Though I would think in your attempt to ensure a classy wedding you might have sacrificed some class..\n\nIt is a bit excessive and does feel a bit tight-fisted  so I understand why others are put off. BUT I also truly understand why you include those. You want your day to be perfect and go smoothly, its understandable! But I think some of the advice in these comments would be worth taking into consideration. Like leaving out the punishments and some of the more obvious wedding etiquette rules and trusting your guests to behave. If they don't you could always have a some ushers quietly assigned to handle any unruly behavior that you specify to them privately.  No need to list out those rules in detail and threaten your guests beforehand.", "NTA, but only because you've not shared this with guests and are asking for feedback before sending anything to anyone else (this is a smart thing to do). These rules are far too formal, restrictive, and poorly worded. I think with a little work you could reword this content to be much more approachable while not obscuring the point you want to get across. I suggest you do this before you go ahead with sending anything to anyone. \n\nI'm not going to go into your decisions about your wedding, but I think maybe consider while writing if you were to verbally explain the rules to a close friend whose opinion you care about, and see if you come up with the same thing?", "Sorry but YTA, some of these are fair but other parts are treating your guests like children who you expect will behave badly. \n\n1. Starting \u201cthis event is semi formal\u2026.\u201d that\u2019s good, maybe rather than \u201crequested\u201d reword as if you can (something a bit less demanding)\n\n2. Starting \u201cno white attire\u2026\u201d unnecessary, everyone who\u2019s ever been to a wedding/seen one on TV knows this, it\u2019s condescending and you don\u2019t need to say you\u2019ll have them removed (even though if it happens you absolutely should)\n\n3. Starting \u201cchildren are expected to behave\u2026.\u201d Again people already know to do this, I get what you\u2019re trying to say but it comes across as rude.

It sounds like you\u2019re expecting them to be rude/ act inappropriately at your wedding which is pretty insulting (especially after n.2) \n\n5. Starting \u201cplus-ones are discouraged\u2026\u201d again I understand what you\u2019re trying to say but it comes across weirdly.

Why are so many brides like this?", "I thought the first paragraph was the whole thing and was like \"that's more than most but fine\" and then the rules unfolded like an adventure contract for hiring a burglar. \n\nYTA, I would not attend. This makes it sound super high strung, high scrutiny, and low fun.", "NTA, but yes, I think revisions are in order.\n\n\"If you would like to dress in the color scheme, wear x. Otherwise, our event is semi-formal with an outdoor reception on grass.\" \n\nNo white and no proposals/announcements are general knowledge. I know reddit ruins us for this, but I think a quiet word to the family gossips that this is exceptionally not welcome would allow this to take care of itself. The gossips will know who's stupid enough to give this a try. And no one will have a right to be a shocked Pikachu if they get thrown out for this.\n\n\"We have a dedicated children's area so that parents may enjoy the party.\" Then follow up with families with small children to let them know that if a kid is fussy, to please take advantage of this service. Most honestly will, as it's a nice date night without them having to find their own childcare.\n\nWatch your RSVPs and keep a spreadsheet. Cousin Amanda got an invite for just her, but RSVPed for three? You call her and set her straight. It's general knowledge that it's bad form to add people to talk RSVP that aren't on the invitation, so you don't need to scold all your guests. You can just privately scold whoever is that tacky. You can even get your parents involved to help the familial shaming if you need to. Or grandma!\n\nNone of your rules or information are unreasonable, but the wording makes it seem like you think most of your guests are AHs, and not kind people who love you and want you to have a lovely wedding day.

Rules are fine, but the tone does not make guests feel like they're there to have a good time with you.

That is the color scheme and I wanted to include it in case anyone wanted to match, but I've already told people that if they wanted to wear a bright red dress or lime green tux, I really don't care. \n\n\"No white attire, excluding shoes/accessories. Guests wearing white attire will be asked to leave or change. If a refusal is made, the guest will be escorted from the event.\"\n\n\"Children are expected to behave and not interrupt the ceremony/first dance. If a child is being disruptive, please take them outside for a breather\"- There is a children's area just for the kids, but if a parent wanted their child with them, this is for that parent\n\n\"No proposals/Pregnancy announcements. Attempts will result in the guest(s) being removed from the event.\u201d\n\n\"Plus-ones are discouraged due to the size of the brides' family, however if you would like to add someone to your invitation, please first let the bride/groom know with your party's head count\" - I tried to include some humor, but she also was offended by this line. I have an enormous family, and I don't have enough money to provide food for that many people, so I only invited immediate family/close friends/and people contributing to the event. I also invited their partners as well (For example, I'm inviting my great aunt, and her partner along with it- or another would be that I'm inviting my younger brothers, so I included their siblings and parents as well. (about 60 people total, including bridesmaids/groomsmen)\n\nThe bottom half of the slip is food/drink, mine and my husband's phone numbers, and the driving directions.\n\nI'm considering rewording some things (I feel like I worded it badly), and maybe separating it into 1 slip each-rules, food, and driving directions. My husband and coworkers (Haven't told anyone else) are saying I should only change Jess's slip.\n\nFor extra context, Jess hasn't contributed anything because I don't want her to. (She helped me out a lot with furniture/appliances when I got my first apartment, and I've just finished paying her back). \n\nAITA for my wedding rules?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Stick with the warning about comfortable shoes though.", "YTA \nI didn\u2019t even make it through the first paragraph before I decided it was something I didn\u2019t want to deal with.", "YTA.

Just put the rule. You don\u2019t need to specify what will happen if you break the rule, unless everyone coming is a child. And hey, maybe they are. At my wedding I had 95 children. Also a bounce house.", "YTA for Champagne vs White for dresses, honestly. Those are way too close and will cause confusion, and perhaps a person getting escorted out  who honestly thought their dress would be fine. The rest is a bit much too. I think a dress color code for the guests is always a bit much. And the others rules... Yeah it's not a good wedding insert period.", "This is just advice, but you need to relax and have fun with your wedding instead of trying to control every detail. Just about everyone who reads this is going to roll their eyes and view your wedding as an obligation instead of a fun celebration.", "YTA.  I already suspected as much since you included rules in your wedding invite at all, and then when I got to the first line I was done.  By the time I got to the end I assumed you didn't think very highly of your friends and family if you think all that actually needs to be put in writing,", "YTA.  I don\u2019t think any of them are much to ask but are annoying.   The way you word it makes you come off as an ansshole and I would probably just ignore the inter if you included these rules.", "I don't want to call you an AH because these are all things that should be respected at a wedding (except the color scheme), but I'm not sure why you feel like you need to spell all these out?\n\nFor plus ones- the invitation should just name who is exactly invited (Jane and a Plus One, Smith Family of Four) and that way, most of your guests will understand who is invited, and then you make the response card very clear. Sure you will get a few people who write in extra people, but then you deal with them. \n\nEveryone should know not to make announcements, and the people who don't won't be dissuaded by spelling it out on the invite. \n\nFor children, you should just note that there is a play area for kids. \n\nThen you can include something about attire: Semi formal, reception is on grass/outside so dress accordingly (I'd want to know this) and then \"our wedding colors are X, so we encourage guests to match our theme.\" I've gotten that request before and if I can follow it, then I do, and if I don't have anything in those colors, I note that it was just a suggestion. \n\nThese are all fine rules and information, but they shouldn't be on a wedding invitation because they are commonly understood rules of wedding etiquette. Spelling them out like this makes you seems a little...overly vigilant, and is kind of off putting. \n\nSo very soft, mild YTA.", "YTA. Yes, it's your wedding and you can have whatever rules you want, but I certainly wouldn't want to go to this wedding. Your grandma is right.\n\nYou don't need to say \"no proposols/wearing white/kids behave/etc.\" This all goes without saying. If someone has no manners, feel free to kick them out, but it doesn't need to be in an information packet.\n\nThe bit about plus ones is super icky. I wouldn't come if I was discouraged from bringing my husband. That's no fun for me, and I'm gonna feel super awkward the whole time. You should want your guests to be comfortable. This is the most AH thing about it. If you invite one single guest, you should give them a plus one. \n\nAlso, there is a way to mention a color scheme without making you seek like a control freak. Just say there is a color scheme and that it would be fun if people joined in.", "YTA. That info slip is incredibly tacky.  I wouldn't go to this wedding after reading that.", "From an etiquette standpoint I think your invitation is way too over the top and condescending. Half the rules (like not wearing white, no proposals, keeping your kids behaved) are already well known social expectations\u2026 it\u2019s unnecessary to list them all out and it just makes it seem like you think your guests are idiots in addition to just making the whole invitation way too long and micromanaging. \n\nThe outfit color request could probably be worded differently too as it will probably rub people the wrong way. It\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s an optional request vs a \u201cmandatory\u201d request. Maybe just indicate the color scheme of the wedding rather than making a specific request. And usually color coordination is only expected from the wedding party, not the guests. \n\nIn other words, the rules themselves don\u2019t make you an asshole. But listing them out like that on the invitation makes does make you sound like one. So soft YTA", "YTA. In one way it's...refreshing that you plan to be upfront about how strict the wedding will be. On the other hand, reading your rules makes me imagine there will be private security hauling off people who offend you.", "People are aware of social rules you don't have to lay it out.

Even if it's a total disaster, it will be over quickly.", "What's the humor part?   that you are the bride and are referring to your family as large?  Also, I don't understand this... are you telling people they can, in fact, bring +1's?  Because your wedding will get a whole lot bigger if you include that line.\n\nThe rest is ridiculous.  You are mixing up \"request\" and \"suggestion\", making it impossible for someone to wear a white shirt under a jacket, telling them how to parent, and how to behave at a wedding.  The only part you should be including is the part about shoes.", "I've never been to a wedding or organized a wedding, and most of this seems like common wedding stuff. But like why make rules. Most of this is already common knowledge and putting it like this seems strange", "NTA- I get that I'm in the minority here.... However to me these are just basic Wedding etiquette more so than rules.....\n\n*  I mean don't wear white (They shouldn't be anyway but I get why you say it because there's always an AITA on here about someone wearing white.)\n* We have a kid area but if you are keeping your kid with you then take their crying asses outside and/or don't let them run around wild... Again something that should be basic, common sense wedding etiquette anyway.\n*  Requesting that ppl wear the correct color scheme... You aren't saying it's mandatory and they are going to get turned away for not wearing those specific colors. And honestly that's something I would appreciate so I don't clash. \n* Letting me know what that the reception is on grass so I know the proper shoes, or to at least bring some flats. Again I would be glad to know this so that I can wear appropriate attire, and again you aren't saying they can't wear high heels but giving them a heads up of the grounds. \n* Don't bring a plus one unless it's Okayed. Really a plus one shouldn't be brought unless specified on the invite anyway..... \n\nSo to me this is nothing over the top or any kind of extra rules that a person would be flabbergasted to adhere to. It's not like you are saying everyone's hair can't be longer than shoulder length and dresses have to be to your ankle or something LOL.", "Add some humor and take out the \"you will be removed from the venue\". That's threatening and off-putting.", "YTA.  Most of these rules are well understood as common wedding etiquette by adults.

You\u2019re setting yourself up to be a traffic cop on your own wedding day.   \n\nThere\u2019s so many stories here about \u201cruined\u201d wedding days.  In all but the most extreme scenarios, only you and your bride can \u201cruin\u201d the day.  It\u2019s your mindset that matters.  Someone wears something too close to white?
