However, I have known Ashley since she was a little under 2 and we have always had a good relationship. She calls me mom and her late mother mommy whenever we talk about her.\n\nTo clear things up, I adopted Ashley when my husband and I got married because of many reasons unrelated to this post but it was a decision all three of us made unanimously and are very happy with. This means if my husband and I were to divorce or anything were to happen to him, Ashley would still be my daughter and I would still be obliged to take care of her.\n\nMy MIL is not happy with this at all. She has always been an absolute nightmare about it and made hurtful comments every chance she gets. According to my SIL and BIL, she was looking forward to my husband and Mina's wedding and is still sad about Mina's death. She doesn't think anyone could ever be good enough to be Ashley's stepmom let alone adopt her.\n\nIt all came to a head last night. MIL and FIL were over for dinner. I had just brought dessert out when MIL gave a cookie box to Ashley and said \"Give this to your mom\". So Ashley brought it to me. MIL then corrected her and said, \"That's your dad's wife, not your mom. The one who takes care of you is your mom.\" She also gave my son a chocolate box with similar instructions.

I work from home and sometimes I get to spend the whole day with them but other times my schedule is crazy so my nanny steps in to pick them from school and take care of them on my crazy schedule days. \n\nI asked my MIL what she meant by that and she said with my logic, a mother is a person who takes care of you. So since I think it's okay for Ashley to call me mom, it's hypocritical if I don't think both Ashley and Axel can call the nanny mom. My husband told her she was being disrespectful. \nFIL excused himself and they both left early so the argument didn't escalate but after thinking about it, I'm  worried what kind of things MIL might tell the kids in private, especially Ashley who has always known she is not my bio daughter.

You are absolutely within your rights to suspend all unsupervised or all contact with her and any one else who is hurting your daughter like this. Your daughter is YOUR daughter and you are HER mom.

But I would like to point out a 2 year old isn\u2019t capable of understanding the adoption. I can under her calling you mom, and you are her mother figure.

And yet there's always a IL trying to stir up shit. I mean, just...why? What does she hope to accomplish other than to make people miserable?", "I don't even think it was that, the kids know who their mum is. The MIL comment was purely meant as a public insult for their mother, it required planning, and a complete disregard of the kids feelings, they knew there was something going on, but not what and we're probably confused.

My oldest half sister was born when her mum and our dad were at university, so \"grandma\" was taking care of my half sister. When they got divorced her mum took her away from \"grandma\". She blamed my mother for this situation (when my father is to blame). \"Grandma\" never accepted my mom or my other sister or me. She was straight toxic to us, everything she said towards us was mean and insulting. Me and my sister as adults first limited later ultimately cut the contact with her. She is the worst person I've ever met. She wasn't invited to our wedding never met my husband nor son. I'm not entirely sure I'm going to participate her funeral once she finally kicks the bucket. If I will it will be only to support my father have been fighting with her over her behavior for nearly 40 years.", "No. MIL deserves no grace for her nasty behavior.  She does not get to use that as an excuse almost a decade later. It sounds like you have been in Ashley's life since she was very young. \n\nAt the end of the day, your husband is Ashley's father, who determined with you that it would be in Ashley's best interest for you to adopt her. His mom needs to back all the off and get over the obscene idea she has the right to interfere with your family.", "Yep that's pretty much what I expected you to say. This isn't really about Mina (or not much). It's about MIL not accepting that her son might not need her help forever. I have a small amount of sympathy; she probably bonded with her granddaughter very closely, and was hurting. But still holding s grudge about it now is immature", "Eff that. She was openly disrespectful in front of the kids, and tried to use them to hurt OP in front of EVERYBODY that would know. That includes her own son. No way she should get unsupervised time with the kids. She needs to change FIRST and I am willing to bet she never will.", "NTA.

What she did is extremely damaging to his family and they wont be seeing his children until she can get herself under control get help for her issues with you and apologize to you and her grandchildren for using them to hurt you. What ur MIL did is shameful", "Absolutely NTA and MIL made it abundantly clear with her petty stunt that she's not mature enough to be trusted alone with your kids. Who the hell does something so mean and self-centered to a kid? That stupid stunt may have been a dig meant to alienate and punish you but actions like that could easily alienate your stepdaughter from your MIL too. Your stepdaughter may have different feelings about your MIL now so you may want to talk to her about what happened and ask her some questions about the time she spends with her grandparents, how she feels about spending time alone with them, etc. Then you can take her feelings into account when you decide if you should cut contact completely, and if the kids do keep seeing your MIL alone your stepdaughter will know she can come to you if anything makes her uncomfortable.\n\nI don't think any kid should ever be reminded of their lack of a bio parent or have a distinction stressed between bio, step, or adoptive labels. because it can make them feel othered or like they don't really fit in with the rest of their family which is total bullshit. \n\nMy cousin's bio dad wasn't in her life much but she had visitation with him and his parents until she was around 5 and told her Mom she never wanted to go back there or see them again after her bio grandmother kept incessently correcting her for referring to her step-dad (Mom's husband) just as Dad because that's the role he'd had in her life since she was 1. Her bio grandma kept correcting her as if repetition was going to change the fact that my cousin had way more of a father daughter relationship with her step-dad than her bio dad. \n\nFast forward 20 years and my cousin still has no desire to see anyone in her bio Dad's family, especially her bio grandparents. Her bio grandmother found her on Facebook and saw that her profile pic was from her wedding and had the nerve to be offended and hurt they hadn't been invited. My cousin figures her bio dad and grandparents were adults who made their choices and those choices had appropriate consequences. Her kids have no idea they have a bio grandfather and great grandparents out there and my cousin has no plans to ever clue them in because biology is bullshit, being there is what matters so her step-dad will always be their only grandfather. I always think her bio grandma kind of bit off her nose to spite her face because her pettiness over my cousin calling her step-dad Dad cost her any relationship she may have had with her only granddaughter. Hope it was worth it for her.", "Nta. She\u2019s evil. Putting things like that in the kids head. I wouldn\u2019t let her be alone with them for YEARS. No kidding.", "Your MIL didn't cross a line. She trampled it and spat on it.\n\nPersonally I would not allow her near either child or myself. Even monitored she comes out with this nonsense. She behaved like this right in front of you.
