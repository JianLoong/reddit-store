However, I have known Ashley since she was a little under 2 and we have always had a good relationship. She calls me mom and her late mother mommy whenever we talk about her.\n\nTo clear things up, I adopted Ashley when my husband and I got married because of many reasons unrelated to this post but it was a decision all three of us made unanimously and are very happy with. This means if my husband and I were to divorce or anything were to happen to him, Ashley would still be my daughter and I would still be obliged to take care of her.\n\nMy MIL is not happy with this at all. She has always been an absolute nightmare about it and made hurtful comments every chance she gets. According to my SIL and BIL, she was looking forward to my husband and Mina's wedding and is still sad about Mina's death. She doesn't think anyone could ever be good enough to be Ashley's stepmom let alone adopt her.\n\nIt all came to a head last night. MIL and FIL were over for dinner. I had just brought dessert out when MIL gave a cookie box to Ashley and said \"Give this to your mom\". So Ashley brought it to me. MIL then corrected her and said, \"That's your dad's wife, not your mom. The one who takes care of you is your mom.\" She also gave my son a chocolate box with similar instructions.

So since I think it's okay for Ashley to call me mom, it's hypocritical if I don't think both Ashley and Axel can call the nanny mom. My husband told her she was being disrespectful. \nFIL excused himself and they both left early so the argument didn't escalate but after thinking about it, I'm  worried what kind of things MIL might tell the kids in private, especially Ashley who has always known she is not my bio daughter.

OP said \"she calls me mom and her late mother mommy whenever we talk about her.\" They do more than just respect her, they actively talk about her in affectionate terms and it's strongly implied that OP has no problem being Mom to birth mother's 'Mommy'. I can imagine that they have pictures of birth mum on the wall alongside pictures of OP, and daughter is encouraged to celebrate her love for them both.\n\nOP sounds like a great mother and stepmother to me.  I don't know what MIL's problem is, but I'd be going low contact at the least.\n\nNTA", "AND doing it, knowing it confuses the kids, who love their mother...despicable.", "You're 100% correct. My youngest was mostly right with me but sometimes I had other things going on. MIL was super sneaky and would take full advantage... Too bad I was sneaky *and* petty. \n\nMy kids would wake up earlier than usual at the IL's house, and due to the layout, they had to go through the kitchen to get to the living room (ie, their toys and TV) from the bedroom they slept in. MIL would be up early and would offer food as soon as she saw the girls wander through. Usually I'd hear the conversation and would take care of it. As the kids got older, it became a non issue because they learned to shut MIL down. (Which led to MIL's crying \"I was just trying to offer her a drink!\" victimhood. We did not play her game.)", "I approve of your sneaky and petty. You're a badass mom. <3", "No you would not and make sure you communicate WHY", "NTA", "NTA. Your daughter should not be exposed to such spite and hate. Poor child, I hope she is able to tell you if that has been happening regularly.", "No, I think you should enforce this rule! She can do a lot of damage to Ashley, like making her believe you don't love her because you work. Don't give in!!", "NTA time to sit down with your daughter and have a conversation with her.  Reassure her that she is special to you and you are her earth mom and her mommy is her angel momma.  You love her and no matter what anyone says she is yours and you are hers.  Have your husband take her out and talk to her about what mil might be telling her.  Nothing wrong with having a nanny.  The phrase \" it takes a village to raise a child \" is said for a reason.  Mil and fil need a timeout.   Boundaries need to be established and consequences need to be practiced   this is not ok at all. I am glad your husband is on your side.", "Imagine how much planning went into that little stunt.", "NTA. She's a complete nightmare. Maybe husband will go no contact after this inappropriateness", "NTA. Your MIL is truly an awful person.", "NTA - not even a little. Your MIL absolutely crossed a line, and if she feels like it's fine to say those things in front of you, there is zero chance that she's not saying it behind your back. The fact that she baked cookies in advance to make this point shows that its clearly on the forefront of her mind. Lock her off from your children, both of them, and let her know her place.", "WOW your MIL is a major AH. You, however, are not.", "Thems be fighting words. \nNTA", "WNBTA\n\nThis behavior is what fucks up kids minds. Just like some divorced parents will try and turn their kids against the other parent and fill their minds w all kinds of crap. \n\nMy parents divorced when my brother was young. I was already married. But mom and dad each told him different things about the other. And it royally screwed his mind up. When he was in his 30s we were talking and he said something like \u201cremember when dad did this\u2026.\u201d I said it never happened. Same thing w mom. He had no concept of what actually happened because they both filled him w BS against the other. \n\nYour MIL is vindictive and she did something so vile right in front of you so the chances of her trying to screw w them while alone are very, very high especially since FIL doesn\u2019t give a shit and let\u2019s her tell them these things. \n\nWhat she did is unforgivable. She screwed w their heads calling the nanny mom right in front of everyone. She knew exactly what she was doing & it had the desired affect and FIL knew she was wrong but walked away. She has zero respect for you, your marriage or your relationship with your kids. I would never allow them to be alone again. Not even letting her visit and me walking into another room w them alone. She could do just as much damage in 5 minutes as if they stayed a full day w her. If she sets her mind to it she could write them a letter and tell them not to tell you. \n\nYou need to be sure and tell your kids there are no secrets between y\u2019all and if anyone ever gives them something to read or any gift at all to make sure they let y\u2019all know. Because she could very well set up a system to get them turned against you by mail, email, messages etc. I\u2019m sure they may have electronic devices so make sure you check them as well. \n\nIf she\u2019s so bold to do that in front of you there is no limit to what she may try to accomplish behind y\u2019all\u2019s backs. \n\nFurthermore because she tried coming between y\u2019all as a family and showed no regard to their mental health I\u2019d even go NC over it. JMO though", "For me, this would be the end of the Saturday visits for awhile. Your hubby needs to question Ashley about what they talk with Grama about and what gramas telling them. That could be a very enlightening conversation. It is too confusing for Ashley to be getting mixed messages. Set boundaries with hubby then let hubby enforce them. A month of unsupervised visits would be where I'd start. Disrespect and confuse my kids..no unsupervised visits for the next month.", "Also, MIL isn\u2019t pushing for the kids to see the nanny as their mum because she thinks it\u2019s in their best interests, but to fuck with OP. Anyone who is willing to use your kids as weapons against you should be immediately banned from seeing them.", "Agree, the MIL sounds absolutely sick and twisted in the head. Drama addict, or maybe poor Mina kissed her ass in some special way or reminded MIL of herself, or the old reliable\u2014envy. Who knows, a healthy mimd can hardly imagine why someone would do this.", "Seems like there\u2019s also an element of shaming OP for not being a SAHM. Why is she the one being slighted and not *the other parent*, their dad, because of the kids having a nanny? They\u2019re both working, they are both the parents, but why only OP?", "Yes! Mothers should be (and normally would be) elated that son has found a life partner who respects his first wife (and the mother of her adopted child) and their memories of her.

It's unfortunate that Mina passed away.  You had nothing to do with that.  MIL should be grateful her granddaughter has an (adoptive) mom who loves her and takes care of her the way you do.  Many working moms have help.  Just because you work from home doesn't mean you can spend every minute with your kids.  You and your husband have come up with a system that works for your family.\n\nSince your husband is supportive of your position, it wouldn't surprise me if he limits his mother's contact as a result of his discussion with her.", "NTA. I would hold firm to that boundary", "MIL is so far over the line it's just a dot to her. You are NTA.", "NTA. Oh the MIL absolutely shouldn't be left alone with the kids!! What an awful human being.", "YWNBTA your MIL is hurting your daughter because of her own personal feelings towards you. She is willing to put her wants over the kids. You should 100% limit their time while you and your husband get MIL under control. Make a plan and have steps that MIL a must do like therapy with you. She\u2019s incredibly toxic and it will effect your daughter as goes through her teenage years and maybe starts rebelling", "Keeping her in your lives seems damaging to the kids. There is no reason to believe she won\u2019t cause trouble. In dealing with her you\u2019ll need to explain to your kids that some adults mean them harm and just because someone is family doesn\u2019t mean they deserve respect. I guess we all learn that stuff at some point but you can delay it", "NTA. So.... MIL thinks the nanny would be her DIL of choice? The hateful woman has mental problems and should be kept away from your kids.", "NTA. But this is cut them out of your lives territory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what she is saying in front of your face. She is going to keep it up.

Some people live for that kind of crap.", "If you haven't already, I'd go ahead and ask your kids what kinds of things she talks about with them when they're alone.  That way you can address any specific concerns she may have planted while you weren't around.", "NTA. CLEARLY she just wanted to start an argument. She knows damn well that a nanny is a caregiver but not a mom.", "Omg NTA, MIL is TA!!! Your that girls mom 100% and you are an amazing one at that, you talk to her about her bio mom and keep her memory and love for her alive. That is so wonderful! Keep up the great work momma!!!!", "NTA. Protect your kids from your MIL. She is a destructive malignant narcissist.", "YWNBTA  \nYou're the parents.

Explain that she is the grandmother and that won\u2019t change unless she continues to be toxic around the kids. Y\u2019all need to ask what the most important thing is to her? I\u2019d hope it\u2019d be the happiness of the kids. \nI\u2019m 40, my real father wasn\u2019t my father figure. I had my maternal grandfather and stepdad for that. My paternal grandmother up until the day she died couldn\u2019t understand why I had SO many issues with my father. She probably would have defended him no matter what. Even as a teenager I didn\u2019t put up with crap. \n\nYou and your husband need to take care of and worry about the kids 1st and foremost. Make sure they can express themselves.

Had she stepped into that position after your daughter's mother passed away, to help your husband ? Just wondering if that could be part of her resentment of you - you came along and filled that positon, taking it away from her. Regardless of whether this is, or is part of her issue with you, your MIL is waaay out of line and DH needs to start issuing consequences for her behavior. She's being quite selfish in making these kinds of statements to your children - she very clearly doesn't care at all about how the things she's saying to the kids, could affect them. She only cares that it hurts YOU, and is obviously, very purposely,  trying to turn your kids against you. \n\n\nYour husband needs to put a stop to it NOW. It's up to him to get this handled. Your husband also needs to speak with his daughter - he needs to explain to her that YOU are her mother, no matter what grandma says AND that she needs to both ignore what grandma tells her concerning mom, and she needs to tell you both every time grandma says things like this to her. She needs to understand that what grandma is doing is NOT okay. At 10, she's plenty old enough to understand", "NTA .

Your MIL is a huge AH and very ignorant if she thinks she isn't hurting her granddaughter with her abhorrent behavior. She is literally only thinking of herself, not her granddaughter at all.

It was the first holiday they\u2019d spent with them since the divorce. Well\u2026 ex \u201cMIL\u201d had a lot to say about me, and none of it good. She said some really hateful things about me to my kids. \n\nMy oldest is 17, and told me all about their grandma\u2019s remarks\u2026 (and proudly let me know of their replies in my defense, lol). Since then, I told my ex-husband in no uncertain terms they will not be spending time with his step-mother again.
