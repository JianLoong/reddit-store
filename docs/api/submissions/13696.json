Ashley is not my bio daughter; she is my husband's from his previous relationship. Her bio mother (Mina) unfortunately died on the day Ashley was born. However, I have known Ashley since she was a little under 2 and we have always had a good relationship. She calls me mom and her late mother mommy whenever we talk about her.\n\nTo clear things up, I adopted Ashley when my husband and I got married because of many reasons unrelated to this post but it was a decision all three of us made unanimously and are very happy with. This means if my husband and I were to divorce or anything were to happen to him, Ashley would still be my daughter and I would still be obliged to take care of her.\n\nMy MIL is not happy with this at all. She has always been an absolute nightmare about it and made hurtful comments every chance she gets. According to my SIL and BIL, she was looking forward to my husband and Mina's wedding and is still sad about Mina's death. She doesn't think anyone could ever be good enough to be Ashley's stepmom let alone adopt her.\n\nIt all came to a head last night. MIL and FIL were over for dinner. I had just brought dessert out when MIL gave a cookie box to Ashley and said \"Give this to your mom\". So Ashley brought it to me. MIL then corrected her and said, \"That's your dad's wife, not your mom. The one who takes care of you is your mom.\" She also gave my son a chocolate box with similar instructions. The kids were confused but I knew she was talking about their part time nanny. I work from home and sometimes I get to spend the whole day with them but other times my schedule is crazy so my nanny steps in to pick them from school and take care of them on my crazy schedule days. \n\nI asked my MIL what she meant by that and she said with my logic, a mother is a person who takes care of you. So since I think it's okay for Ashley to call me mom, it's hypocritical if I don't think both Ashley and Axel can call the nanny mom. My husband told her she was being disrespectful. \nFIL excused himself and they both left early so the argument didn't escalate but after thinking about it, I'm  worried what kind of things MIL might tell the kids in private, especially Ashley who has always known she is not my bio daughter. They spend every other Saturday with their grandparents and so MIL would have plenty of time to mess with their minds. \n\nMy husband is going to talk to her tomorrow since he couldn't say much with the kids in the room but I think this time MIL crossed a major line and should not be allowed to spend time with them unmonitored. So WIBTA if I enforced this rule?\n\nETA: FIL doesn't always agree with MIL but he never voices his opinion so I don't think his presence counts as \"monitored\"", "created_utc": 1680328835, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128czyw/wibta_if_i_banned_my_mil_from_spending_alone_time/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Limit contact between MIL and your kids \u2014 zero contact even \u2014 because she has proven herself to be hateful in public. She\u2019d be a lot worse in private. \n\nHer behaviour is totally out of line. Encouraging the children to see the nanny as their mom is beyond bizarre and inappropriate. She\u2019s encouraging them not to see you as their mom, much less any sort of authority figure. Nip it in the bud, OP.", "Definitely NTA, you are her mother, you care for her and love her. MIL clearly does not know the definition of \u201cmother\u201d, I completely agree with your decision here.", "Wow this is 8 years after A\u2019s mom passed?? MIL has some serious issues, and should NOT be allowed to spill that toxicity onto your family.", "NTA. It's pretty clear this has been brewing for some time in MIL's head, and who knows what other lies she's been whispering to the kids while in her care. She absolutely no longer deserves time with her grandkids. You are a mom. You stepped up and built a relationship with Ashley, caring for her and giving your unconditional love and respect. That's what a mom does. Just because your work schedule prevents you from doing 100% of the childcare duties 24/7 doesn't make you any less of a mom.", "NTA\n\nOP your MIL is not only toxic to your and your kids, but downright venomous to her core. \nYou have a great relationship with Ashley, and kudos to you for stepping up and being her mom even though you're not her mother. \n\nYou and your husband need to sit down with your in-laws and set the record straight, setting firm boundaries and if that means stopping contact with yourselves and the kids then so be it. She's only got herself to blame.", "NTA.\n\n I would also recommend that you talk to your daughter about what\u2019s going on. You know her maturity level, so keep it where she is, but she\u2019s old enough to catch on to things and may internalize some of this. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your MIL is being so terrible. Idk if she needs a grief counselor of what, but you should know that her issues are hers. I am sorry she\u2019s making them yours.", "Nta. Womans going to poison your children's mind with  nonsense. She needs to check herself before shes allowed back", "NTA\n\nShe is hurting your kids and your family.", "No. You ARE her mother. Do what us mamas have to do and stand up for your children\u2019s peace of mind and happiness. Do not let her taint your family and your kids heads with her hatred and jealousy. Stay strong. And if your husband isn\u2019t able to get on board and have your back about this then it\u2019s time to have a conversation about that as well. He is the one who should be reminding her of her place and reinforcing how you feel.", "NTA - I wouldn\u2019t be letting my kids spend time with anyone who said crap like! God only knows what she says behind your back if she\u2019s brave enough to say it in front of your face!! \n\nNothing will bring back Ashley\u2019s bio mom, the way she\u2019s treating you is atrocious and leaving Ashley confused and pretty much telling her she isn\u2019t allowed a mom because hers died!", "Edit: I just wanted to clear something up before anyone takes my intent the wrong way. I dealt with a psycho MIL for over 25 years. My wife **never** challenged them until **after** we were divorced and now she sees how bad they were to me. Finally. Too little too late.\n\nAnyways, just don't want my message below to be lost on anyone. I am definitely not siding with the MIL.\n\n> My MIL is not happy with this at all\n\n>My husband is going to talk to her tomorrow\n\nThis is very much not a you problem, and very much your husband's problem.\n\nYou're just the one with the target painted on your back because of her deficiency, but you can't solve that.\n\nFor you to step in and do anything in this case would alienate you from your husband's mother, and perhaps damage your relationship with your husband because inevitably, you'll suffer indefinitely with your MIL talking negatively about you to him, and incessantly attacking your relationship.\n\nHe absolutely needs to step up and handle this, for you, for him, for your children. She's way out of line.\n\nTo my opinion, YWBTA if you said anything about this because frankly, this is not a deficiency with you so much as a deficiency with your husband, his prior relationship, and his mother.\n\nIf he doesn't handle this and shut it down, he absolutely is an asshole.", "Absolutely YWNBTA. What a spiteful woman.", "NTA. That was a seriously mean dig, calling the nanny \"mom\" in front of you in a way that was confusing enough to the kids that it was bound to cause a discussion and drama. I don't know what it has to do with Mina, though. MIL is furious that you have a nanny and don't dedicate yourself 100% to childcare. (I doubt that she is concerned that your husband doesn't dedicate himself 100% to childcare.) \n\nHe needs to talk to them, but I still wouldn't trust her to be alone with them again.", "Absolutely nta... Family doesn't require blood relation. What a petty cow. Toxic indeed.", "NTA\n\nWhy in the world is she hurting her son\u2019s family.", "NTA - go for it, protect your children", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWOW! Your MIL is an asshole. If that's how she behaves with you present, I hate to think what she might say when you're not around. \nYou need to protect your children from your MIL.", "wnbta\n\nterribly rude", "NTA. It's incredibly selfish of your MIL to treat you this way, and this could just burden your kids in the future. She shouldn't have to involve HER OWN GRANDCHILDREN in this just because she has issues with you. \n\n I'm glad your husband is stepping up to talk to her. I hope you two are on the same page about this banishment. Good luck!", "NTA. Your mil is toxic. Did she feel like your daughter's mother in any way before you started dating your husband? Her behavior doesn't shout grief as much as jealousy to me.\n\nYour children should not be allowed alone with her. First, for the toxic things she will say to your daughter and then my fear of how she will treat your son as he is biologically related to you.\n\nHer words could do serious harm to your children's mental health and your family. If they do still see her unsupervised I suggest a therapist a few times a month for them to discuss their feelings. The cookie thing is over the top.", "Nta. You are their mom. Mil is bitter and actually hurts the kids. Kids understand more than she thinks.", "I think this'd be an ESH if you did. Not because I'm on the MIL's side at all (omg she sounds like a nightmare with some major issues) but because that's not a decision you can or should make alone. \n\nShe's still your husband's mom and, really, he needs to be the one to step up here. You dictating this could cause strains all around...\n\nIt needs to be a joint decision between you and your husband. Maybe even have a talk with your kids to see how they feel about things?\n\nYou're WELL within your rights to be angry. Just be careful how you play things. Going full nuclear may end up being counter productive in the long run...maybe instead of striaght to a permanent ban, a couple  supervised and/or shortened visits to show how serious this is & you are? And if MIL and FIL screw up while on that probation it'd probably be easier for your husband and feel less extreme to him to do more after that?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
