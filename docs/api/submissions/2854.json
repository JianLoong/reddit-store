Yay.", "From the way it's worded, it sounds like it was a different co-worker who made the comment than the co-worker who hosted the event.", "Oh they'll do something about it alright, by removing/stagnating the less expensive person to replace (aka the OP's girlfriend). Meanwhile, the senior doctor in question will do everything they can to make her life miserable and stagnate/end her career.", ">Can't be expected to stay silent \n\nCertainly not without a heads up. Personally, if my partner told me \"there's a homophobe at work, and my job prospects will be better if you accept his nonsense with a smile\" I'd probably choose not to attend the function.", "Your analogy would require both you and your gf to be black. As it\u2019s written you are suggesting the gf expected OP to put up with something for a few hours that she has to put up with daily. In your scenario you expect your gf to put up with something you never have to. It\u2019s not the same.", "Well OP's girlfriend gave no such heads-up.", "NTA a bigot has no place being in a position of power and caring for people.", "It's...complicated. While I agree with you on a social level, politically well...\n\nYour girlfriend has gone from a student to an equal, but there's still a hierarchy, as she pointed out. Disrespecting the higher-ups she obviously tolerates for some reason isn't going to earn her any favours. When she didn't correct him herself, I think you should have taken the cue from her, but I can't blame you for speaking before thinking in a situation like that.\n\nMy hearts says not the ahole but my brain says , soft ESH. It's a complicated situation not really suited to reddit with its complete lack of nuance. There's nothing that can be done now in any case. The issue in this case isn't so much the man was being homophobic as much as it was embarrassing a higher-up coworker of your partner. Yes, he was an asshole, but he was an asshole with power over your partners future career. You shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you, even if that hand is flipping you off, I suppose.\n\nYou could always send him a fruit basket with a note apologising. \"You've just had people make that mistake before but *obviously* he would never make such a *silly* error as to assume you and gf were just friends, a *smart* man like him. Really it must have been so insulting of you to insinuate he was in any way slow on the uptake, and you hope he doesn't hold it against gf\"\n\nYou know, if you wanted to go full scorched earth.", "Respected? With those kind of ideas in a 'progressive' hospital?\n\nReally? Because I really thought that progressive/inclusive meant that homophobes were either removed, or forced to keep their hate inside.   \nAnd, we do not play nice with bigots - it is 2022 now - not 1407 or something.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd, GF might be afraid of the reputation - but what happens to the image of the hospital as 'inclusive' if news were to leak they employ a homophobic (beep)?", "I considered saying E S H, but no, NTA. LGBT people should NOT have to live in fear and second guess everything they say or do to avoid being seen as anything except equal.\n\nIf this causes problems for your partner, my heart goes out to you both. But I think we live in a world where bigoted people deserve ridicule, and I am happy that you were able to make your point. I would rather be with someone like you who doesn't feel like hiding, than with someone so concerned with image and career that they can't live just like any other person.\n\nI understand your partner's feelings, and she does have the ability to set a boundary and end things if she is afraid it will negatively impact her, but I think the world would be better if people stopped entertaining bigotry. You will be TA if you don't talk this over with her though. Best to make it known how you feel and not show up to any event that is going to treat you as less than equal", "YTA. If you're as adult as you say you would know that actions have consequences and sometimes it's best to shut your damn mouth. This could impact your girlfriends career all because you couldn't read the situation which is just irritating. We are the same age so I don't get how you could be so tactless.", "I'm going with YTA\n\nI will never understand people who feel the need to force random strangers to validate their sexuality. So what he's homophobic. He isn't hurting you or attacking you. He asked a snide question instead of brushing it off you decided to engage even though your gf clearly doesn't want you to because he has the power to make her life difficult.", "YTA she\u2019s a new doctor, she doesn\u2019t want to start her career off badly, better to not rock the boat until it won\u2019t spill over and ruin her career", "INFO: is it possible this person was well intentioned but unintentionally used awkward phrasing?", "YTA....not everyone has to accept you. They should but don't and now you made her job significantly harder. Also you guys will break up", "YTA you sound like you were just looking & waiting for something, anything to be offensive so you could jump on your pedestal. And you GF has to work with these ppl.

Yes, he\u2019s homophobic but you don\u2019t have to make your girlfriend\u2019s working relationships more difficult, especially when it\u2019s not your workplace, so you don\u2019t have to deal with the consequences of it. You should\u2019ve let her handle it her way.", "YTA", "NTA screw his homophobia and screw your girlfriend for defending it.", "YTA-Jeopardize her career, for what? Your entertainment?", "NTA. You weren\u2019t insulting in any way, you gave him a clear out of \u201coh sorry for the misunderstanding\u201d.

If op knew, debatable, but she didn't...", "I'm assuming you don't hold a job yet, and definitely not in a hospital. Do you really think HR does anything about this stuff, specially when it's a *senior male doctor* saying it?? Dream on. Hierarchies are alive and well in this \"traditional\" jobs (medics, lawyers, academics...), and accountability is something that the \"old guard\" doesn't have to worry about.", "Man, your parties must be a blast if nobody is allowed to discuss any kind of personal detail of their lives. What do y'all talk about? Just weather and sportsball?", "Then it's GF's prerogative whether to report them there.\n\nOP doing this makes the workplace harder for GF.  OP doesn't have to deal with the fallout-GF will, however,", "The unfortunate thing is that how OP deals with it outside of work can make it hell for GD *inside* of work. If OP antagonizes and gives in to the comments, it could lead to dr ah purposely messing with Gf at work,.\n\nGf definitely should have said something about him but I'm guessing that Gf either didn't think dr ah would be there, thought she could avoid him, or just didn't know how to start the topic of 'hey btw i have a homophobic coworker who may be here tonight and I'm going to need you to please not say anything if he opens his mouth\"", "While I recognize that whole in my particular analogy, I feel if you made it about coworkers and kept the racial aspect my point still stands.

Don't just plug Black people into the experience of another marginalized group to make a point.", "So, wait, are you saying that if you invited your s/o to a work event you knew would be attended by some crusty old fuck who casually uses racist slurs or stereotypes around the office but that you tried to avoid conflict with because they were ina senior position to you, that you not only wouldn't give your partner of the same race a heads up that this guy is  a dick but that maybe we should hold our tongue? And then, having not given any warning to your s/o, you would get all aggro on the way home at them because they reacted to a seemingly racially motivated slight from some rando at the work function with a polite but firm demand of personal respect?\n\nBecause if you aren't saying that, then my analogy isn't flawed.", "I was just speaking from my own experience with having racist family members and friends / romantic partners of color.

That wasn't my intent. \n\nAnyway, I'm going to bed, have a nice day / rest of your life, internet stranger.", "Dude chill, ppl are just pointing out that the situation in the post is slightly different than the analogy. They're similar but also keeping in mind the differences. You don't even need the analogy to understand the post. The 110 upvoters agreed with you anyway you don't need to argue with a few comments"]}
