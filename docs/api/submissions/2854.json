The politics in a hospital setting are tricky as hell and your girlfriend just waded into it as a newbie. It her career and money on the line here, not yours and that makes it her maze to navigate. Regardless of your Sexual ty, relationships hinge on being able to allow your partner to set the pace in certain settings. She is obviously proud of you, and is not hiding you or the nature of your relationship. She's simply asking you to not be antagonistic.

At the very least, this AH doctor has the ability to make her work-life miserable and potentially block her from career-advancing opportunities. If she asks you to back away from a confrontation, then you probably should. You don't have to deal with the fallout; she does.", "NAH between you and your girlfriend, though obviously this guy is an asshole. I can see why it'd make things awkward for your girlfriend at work. Not everybody wants to be a trailblazer and take on powerful people, especially in workplaces where awful people can hold a lot of power based on seniority and prestige. That said, I don't think you're obligated to grab a broom and join the brigade of people sweeping this guy's nonsense under the rug. I think you and your girlfriend may want to discuss how to handle another situation like this if there's a chance of running into him, though somehow I imagine he won't be at any pride events anytime soon.", "NTA. \n\nSmooth, OP.\n\nYou did not call him out on his homophobia by calling him a homophobic bigot. You simply acted as though there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication. This reversed his slight and took his power away because he knows he probably can't overtly and explicitly display his bigotry without consequences.", "i don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything necessarily wrong with how you handled the situation. maybe it was a bit over kill with the kiss just because some people aren\u2019t comfortable around PDA but i think you were fine in correcting him. however i do see why your gf reacted the way she did because she is in a new position and doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat at work with the long time \u201crespected\u201d geezers. give her some grace but tell her how you feel and how you could\u2019ve both handled the situation better. in a relationship it should be you two against the problem not you against her\n\n\nedit: NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd Anyone that says YTA, is most likely homophobic.\n\nNo one needs to put up with that sort of behaviour from anyone, ever.\n\nThe fact ppl don\u2019t pull him up on it, means they are unconsciously telling him that his behaviour is ok.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if they are a \u201crespected\u201d doctor, their behaviour shows that they do not deserve respect.\n\nTell your GF to go to HR if the doctor harasses her at work for being gay, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d love to hear about it.", "If the hospital is inclusive, then if this doctor becomes unprofessional, your partner should report it. There is a large shortage of medical professionals and in this situation where the hospital openly touts their progressive stance, he will be reined in because the hospital cannot run with just him.

NTA", "NTA\n\nUnless she gave you warning about this guy and the workplace dynamics in play, you are NTA.\n\nI think you handled it very smoothly and in a non-confrontational way. No anger, no arguing, just a statement of fact and a smooch on the cheek. Without her telling you about this wahoo dude and asking you to let whatever homophobic comments he made slide on by without comment, how were you supposed to know the politics involved? You were standing up for yourself and your partner, as you should.", "NTA. Sounds like you knew the intent behind his comment and very tactfully (and much more gracefully than I would\u2019ve) handled it. I applaud you", "I may end up in the minority here, but I think you're NTA. Bigots should be called out. I think you did it with flair.", "NTA - Your gf didn't say it, you did, you don't work there. The social gatherings where non-hospital folks can see and call out people for who they really are could be just the push some of the other doctors need to stop taking his shit in the workplace.", "NTA - especially in the current political climate we need to stand up for ourselves. What you did was totally fine. If you were straight and he'd made the same \"mistake\" no one would bat an eyelid at how you handled this, so you have every God damn right to assert yourself.\n\nNot sure how many of the other people here are queer, let alone gay; but either way it seems the concensus is this was the right thing to do. As a gay guy myself, I just wanted to like give you a thumbs up too. Whenever I find myself in this kind of situation I do the exact same thing, polite but firm establish we exist. Ya did good, hang in there, and fuck that guy.", "NTA you didn't do anything rude, it sounds like you misunderstood his homophobia for an honest misunderstanding. Even if it was purposeful it was a tactful way to handle it, make him be upfront and forward about his bigotry.", "YTA, it\u2019s a work setting. Yeah that guy sucks but it\u2019s not your job to be slaying dragons at her work event.", "NAH. I think your reaction was pretty understandable and not over the top at all. You made a statement of fact. You weren\u2019t aware at the time that he had so much influence in your gf\u2019s place of work. At the same time I understand your gf\u2019s concerns and think they\u2019re valid. She doesn\u2019t want to be retaliated against in the workplace for being gay. There\u2019s likely legal protections in place to prevent retaliation on the basis of sexual orientation but that doesn\u2019t mean having to go down that route won\u2019t have a potential negative impact on her career.", "I think \"homophobic\" is the most ridiculously overused and misused word on the planet, right now.  Meetings or gatherings of peers working in a hospital facility are not the place for personal relationship info or PDAs.  There may be management, or colleagues from other depts or facilities, and a level of professionalism is expected to be maintained.  Your snide remarks should have been kept to yourself, and you need to stop assuming that anyone else cares or wants to know her personal info.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
