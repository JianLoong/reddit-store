Can't be expected to stay silent with such blatant disrespect thrown directly at you like that. \n\nGirlfriend might be okay to ignore it at work, but this isn't work, and this was a jerk calling OP just a \"friend\" right in front of her.", "No.\n\nIt means you\u2019re ok with homophobic behaviour, and instead of standing up against it, you endorse it by staying silent.\n\nPiss off with your holier then though attitude.", "They're also in charge of nearly everything. Yay.", "From the way it's worded, it sounds like it was a different co-worker who made the comment than the co-worker who hosted the event.", "Oh they'll do something about it alright, by removing/stagnating the less expensive person to replace (aka the OP's girlfriend). Meanwhile, the senior doctor in question will do everything they can to make her life miserable and stagnate/end her career.", ">Can't be expected to stay silent \n\nCertainly not without a heads up. Personally, if my partner told me \"there's a homophobe at work, and my job prospects will be better if you accept his nonsense with a smile\" I'd probably choose not to attend the function.", "Your analogy would require both you and your gf to be black. As it\u2019s written you are suggesting the gf expected OP to put up with something for a few hours that she has to put up with daily. In your scenario you expect your gf to put up with something you never have to. It\u2019s not the same.", "Well OP's girlfriend gave no such heads-up."]}
