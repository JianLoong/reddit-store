But, you are an AH for doing it with your partner's co-workers.  This is her career, she has worked hard to get to where she is.  She has to work with him, if she's ok with ignoring him, respect her wishes & just love her & support her.  You don't have to go to any work events where this man might be if you don't want to.  Or, you could go & just ignore him for her.", "This is probably going to be unpopular as hell but YTA. The politics in a hospital setting are tricky as hell and your girlfriend just waded into it as a newbie. It her career and money on the line here, not yours and that makes it her maze to navigate. Regardless of your Sexual ty, relationships hinge on being able to allow your partner to set the pace in certain settings. She is obviously proud of you, and is not hiding you or the nature of your relationship. She's simply asking you to not be antagonistic. If she remains a physician for the rest of her life then she is going to be dealing with jerks all day long, every day. Are you going to have her back and support her or are you just going to make those days longer by engaging in pissing contests with old, bigoted men?", "Soft YTA- obviously this guy is the biggest AH but work place politics and relationships can be complex and challenging to navigate. Furthermore, from physicians I know, they don\u2019t change jobs often.\n\nIn this case, your GF is the newbie, trying to find her footing. This is her livelihood and career, and unless she asks otherwise, this was a time to follow her lead.", "ESH - that person sucks but it is also not your place to throw bombs in your GF\u2019s place of work if that\u2019s not her desire.", "NTA for standing up for yourself against a homophobe and a bully, but I think you need to consider the unintended consequences your actions may have for your girlfriend. At the very least, this AH doctor has the ability to make her work-life miserable and potentially block her from career-advancing opportunities. If she asks you to back away from a confrontation, then you probably should. You don't have to deal with the fallout; she does.", "NAH between you and your girlfriend, though obviously this guy is an asshole. I can see why it'd make things awkward for your girlfriend at work. Not everybody wants to be a trailblazer and take on powerful people, especially in workplaces where awful people can hold a lot of power based on seniority and prestige. That said, I don't think you're obligated to grab a broom and join the brigade of people sweeping this guy's nonsense under the rug. I think you and your girlfriend may want to discuss how to handle another situation like this if there's a chance of running into him, though somehow I imagine he won't be at any pride events anytime soon.", "NTA. \n\nSmooth, OP.\n\nYou did not call him out on his homophobia by calling him a homophobic bigot. You simply acted as though there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication. This reversed his slight and took his power away because he knows he probably can't overtly and explicitly display his bigotry without consequences.", "i don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything necessarily wrong with how you handled the situation. maybe it was a bit over kill with the kiss just because some people aren\u2019t comfortable around PDA but i think you were fine in correcting him. however i do see why your gf reacted the way she did because she is in a new position and doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat at work with the long time \u201crespected\u201d geezers. give her some grace but tell her how you feel and how you could\u2019ve both handled the situation better. in a relationship it should be you two against the problem not you against her\n\n\nedit: NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd Anyone that says YTA, is most likely homophobic.\n\nNo one needs to put up with that sort of behaviour from anyone, ever.\n\nThe fact ppl don\u2019t pull him up on it, means they are unconsciously telling him that his behaviour is ok.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if they are a \u201crespected\u201d doctor, their behaviour shows that they do not deserve respect.\n\nTell your GF to go to HR if the doctor harasses her at work for being gay, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d love to hear about it.", "If the hospital is inclusive, then if this doctor becomes unprofessional, your partner should report it. There is a large shortage of medical professionals and in this situation where the hospital openly touts their progressive stance, he will be reined in because the hospital cannot run with just him. He is used to his perks and former power, but in the healthcare climate we live in now, he can kick rocks. NTA", "NTA\n\nUnless she gave you warning about this guy and the workplace dynamics in play, you are NTA.\n\nI think you handled it very smoothly and in a non-confrontational way. No anger, no arguing, just a statement of fact and a smooch on the cheek. Without her telling you about this wahoo dude and asking you to let whatever homophobic comments he made slide on by without comment, how were you supposed to know the politics involved? You were standing up for yourself and your partner, as you should.", "NTA. Sounds like you knew the intent behind his comment and very tactfully (and much more gracefully than I would\u2019ve) handled it. I applaud you", "I may end up in the minority here, but I think you're NTA. Bigots should be called out. I think you did it with flair.", "NTA - Your gf didn't say it, you did, you don't work there. The social gatherings where non-hospital folks can see and call out people for who they really are could be just the push some of the other doctors need to stop taking his shit in the workplace.", "NTA - especially in the current political climate we need to stand up for ourselves. What you did was totally fine. If you were straight and he'd made the same \"mistake\" no one would bat an eyelid at how you handled this, so you have every God damn right to assert yourself.\n\nNot sure how many of the other people here are queer, let alone gay; but either way it seems the concensus is this was the right thing to do. As a gay guy myself, I just wanted to like give you a thumbs up too. Whenever I find myself in this kind of situation I do the exact same thing, polite but firm establish we exist. Ya did good, hang in there, and fuck that guy.", "NTA you didn't do anything rude, it sounds like you misunderstood his homophobia for an honest misunderstanding. Even if it was purposeful it was a tactful way to handle it, make him be upfront and forward about his bigotry.", "YTA, it\u2019s a work setting. Yeah that guy sucks but it\u2019s not your job to be slaying dragons at her work event.", "NAH. I think your reaction was pretty understandable and not over the top at all. You made a statement of fact. You weren\u2019t aware at the time that he had so much influence in your gf\u2019s place of work. At the same time I understand your gf\u2019s concerns and think they\u2019re valid. She doesn\u2019t want to be retaliated against in the workplace for being gay. There\u2019s likely legal protections in place to prevent retaliation on the basis of sexual orientation but that doesn\u2019t mean having to go down that route won\u2019t have a potential negative impact on her career.", "I think \"homophobic\" is the most ridiculously overused and misused word on the planet, right now.  Meetings or gatherings of peers working in a hospital facility are not the place for personal relationship info or PDAs.  There may be management, or colleagues from other depts or facilities, and a level of professionalism is expected to be maintained.  Your snide remarks should have been kept to yourself, and you need to stop assuming that anyone else cares or wants to know her personal info.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its either deal with bigoted comments or support the GF? OP just needs to smile and nod if they want to stay in this relationship?  \n\nI'm not trying to be snarky.

If this doctor is making homophobic statements openly at work, especially directed at or in front of his gay co-workers that is entirely on him.", "I mostly agree here, but closer to nah(between op and gf- dr ah is.. an ah) - while you're  right that op should take gf's lead in this situation (or had the choice to stay home - noone should be forced to accept bigotry), as several other people have said, there isnt really any indication that they talked beforehand about how to handle any homophobic comments/behavior. sometimes a partner can, as an outsider, civilly push back without the same blowback that the gf would have if *she* were the one responding to her coworkers (as long as they are relatively restrained about it - though they shouldnt have to be, that's  sometimes the reality). of course, it could also be the case, as it was here, that gf would rather stay inder the radar and not anger the more powerful dr bigot. \n\nop is not a mind reader, and she responded in a pretty measured/reasonable way, so I hesitate to call her the ah when there was no discussion of how to deal with this situation beforehand (gf could have just as easily been upset that op didnt defend her if shed made a different decision). likewise, the gf may not known that dr homophobe would be so directly disrespectful - and she's likely lashing out a little out of fear for her career (not ideal, but understandable) - so she isnt much of an ah either. they are two people doing their best to deal with entrenched bigotry, and honestly doing  so with more grace than many would - there really is no perfect way to deal with such an unfair and imperfect situation.", "Oh I knew what he was saying, I grew up gay in a red state lol", "Is it professional to give your coworkers dirty looks and make rude remarks about their significant others like this guy did? Standards of professionalism are in place for everyone, and that guy actually works at the workplace in question unlike OP.", "So the straight couple also talking about how they also were having a hard time buying a house were out of line too? \n\nOr what about the straight couple talking about how hard it is to choose the best preschool is that grossly over sharing. \n\nWas it too much that the 50 year old couple held hands?\n\nOr is it only gross because we\u2019re both women.\n\nIn the wake of ANOTHER mass shooting in a gay club I\u2019m simply not taking your homophobic bullshit. Queer people don\u2019t live by different rules than straight people to make you feel comfortable. Grow up.", "Fair enough. I just didn't want to include the girlfriend as a possible As*.", "I am still mad that there\u2019s those types of people in charge of our health.

And he technically just asked how they met and referred to her as a friend rather than gf. I don't think this is going far with HR at this point.", "Except, if anything it's Dr. Girlfriend that *is* TA definitely not OP. If I invite my black girlfriend to Thanksgiving and I know my uncle is racist, but he holds sway in my family, and I stand to possibly make an inheritance, so I put up with his casual racism, and would like my black girlfriend to put up with it for an evening without talking back, not only am I TA in the first place, but I'm really TA if I don't give her a heads up before we get there about the antagonistic uncle and my hopes/expectations for how she should handle it. And I'm *really,* really TA if I then get upset later that my girlfriend responded to unwarranted, unexpected bigotry with  respectful pushback. Why would I expect anyone to put up with some seemingly rando bigot without so much as huff?", "It says he also makes these comments at work", "OP said the her girlfriend had spoken about a few of the physicians before so they were not going into a situation that they had no awareness of. Additionally, taking someone to a family dinner and taking someone to a professional function are two different things. No one is suggesting that OP allow someone to talk smack to their face. Rather, OP should have let the girlfriend take the lead on what amounted to a snarky comment.", "Where does it say anything about her speaking of the other physicians before? The only comment  I can find about before the dinner is how she found the dynamic weird going from student to peer. \n\nIn fact OP says DrGf mentioned in the car AFTER the party that she knew that guy was homophobic. So she knowingly brought OP into this situation and then guilted her later for not letting this guy be snide without being what IMO was only fractionally snide in return."]}
