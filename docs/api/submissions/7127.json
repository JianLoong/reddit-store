Her current approach sounds unfair to everyone living in the house.", "NTA. She didn't have a problem when her son refused to share the PS4.

She is trying to endorse a double standard which will never work. You two need to sit down and have a serious discussion about how you are going to proceed as a family.  She is your fianc\u00e9, so obviously you both are planning on a future together.  You need to devise a structure for your family. Parenting separately is NOT going to work.  I understand that it\u2019s not always possible to parent the exact same way when you have co-parents outside of the home involved. But for the time the kids are in YOUR HOME you need to be on the same page.  You have to start thinking of yourselves as two parents with four children - not my kids vs her kid.  You need to both agree, +/- compromise, how to move forward and stick to it. If there\u2019s a question of favoritism down the road, address is privately, not in front of the kids. They should to see you guys as a team.  Please do this now before you get married.", "Her son not wanting the girls to play on it whether he\u2019s there or not or watch him play is perfectly understandable.

The haptic feedback on the controller is the only big difference outside of performance, and that\u2019s not worth fighting about.", "You and your fianc\u00e9 are both AHs. So going with ESH (directed at the adults, not the kids).\n\nYou have both already set the precedent that your kids will be treated separately. This is appalling.\n\nI'm not saying that the kids should share everything equally all of the time, but they have to learn to get along and co-exist. You and your partner are encouraging them to be territorial and petty over their space and belongings.", "Honestly I think both of you are(her more so than you). She is for allowing her son to act that way in the first place and then getting upset when it is turned around onto her and her child. You are because instead of sitting down and discussing your concerns and the issue of sharing and your twins getting their own, you just have the mentality of \u201cwell if your kid can act selfish then so can mine\u201d. You\u2019re both acting immature and not taking the opportunity to grow a caring, sharing family dynamic.\n\nESH.", "YTA. I disagree that there is no longer a reason to share. Had you purchased the twins a PS4 this would be true. But the twins have a superior console and everyone knows it. If you insist on pretending that all things are equal and allow the girls to continue denying Ryan access to their new console Ryan and your fiancee will justifiably think you're being TA. You should sit Ryan down and discuss how being selfish and not sharing wasn't a problem when it was him who was doing it and try to get him to see that the way he feels now is how he made the girls feel. You can still turn this into a valuable lesson about sharing for all of the children if you approach it right. Pretending like \"everyone has a console now\" is the end of the story will make Ryan resent you and the twins through no fault of their own. It also teaches the twins not to share.\n\nI would seek a compromise with the children that involves swapping consoles occasionally. My best friend growing up had an arrangement with his older brother over the gaming consoles in the house. They regularly swapped out who had the new vs old playstation, as required by their parents. Not to say there weren't disagreements, but it was far more fair than one person getting sole access to the newest console on the market.\n\nYou're really just replacing one inequality for another and reinforcing selfishness. \n\nEdit: grammar. Added the last sentence.", "This kid is 14 years old, a teenager in his phase..of course he doesn't want to hang out with the 2 younger sisters, are you dumb ? Now, again, i get you want to teach him a lesson, but you're taking the wrong approach. PS: both you and the fianc\u00e9e need to talk about how you want to educate your children, cause if you do one thing and she does the other, it just won't work.", ">I told them to let Ryan play on it sometimes. \n\nINFO why are you not enforcing what YOU told them to do?", "YTA. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right as much as you might want them to. Teaching the girls the value of sharing and compassion and compromise at an early age will benefit them in the long run. Growing up with a tit-for-tat and self riotous mentality will result in weak adults later, a growing problem in the US workforce. This is not what Melania meant by be best\ud83d\ude14", "OP needs to rethink this relationship. She's making it perfectly clear she's going to always play favorites and hold his children to different standards than her own. It's going to just get so much worse if they get married. \n\nNTA", "OP please read this. Do not marry this woman. This is going to be an exhausting life with her.", "This.  Gosh I am sick of crappy step family posts around here.", "It's crazy how many step parents on here are absolute, blatant hypocrites.NTA", "She will also goes behind OPs back and tries to force her children to do something that she already told them that she doesn't want. Even punish them. What if OP didn't catch her? She would have force the twins to share even though the mother said \"no\".\n\nEdit: corrections", "True, the Marinara Flags are the problem!", "Except OP did tell the girls to share occasionally which is more than Ryan does", "So the girls missed out entirely when Ryan had a console. But now that they have a better one, they have to swap it equally with his?\n\nThat would just teach Ryan that he always gets the sweet end of the deal.\n\nI agree that this situation and solution sucks, but teaching the girls that Ryan doesn\u2019t have to share until something better comes along for them isn\u2019t the answer either.", "This kid is 14 yo and should already understand the concept of sharing and not always getting his way, this is his mother's failing, not the OP's, not the OP's daughters', and not the PS5's", "Both are female \u263a\ufe0f", "Right which is why I said her more so than him but they\u2019re both acting childish and setting a poor example.", "Agreed, best solution would have been to simply buy a ps4 for the girls and been done with it. Buying a ps5 now makes ryan jealous cause he's naturally gonna want to play the newer console. \n\nHowever the kids aren't to blame for any of this, its 100% on the parents, they both screwed up when they didn't establish proper sharing of the ps4 to begin with, they screwed up again when they allowed sharing of the new ps5, if the rule was the girls can't play the ps4 cause its Ryan's and its in his room then they should never have allowed sharing the ps5 cause its the girls and in their room, you can't have different sets of rules for different children.\n\nWhat can they do about it now? The only fair thing is to apply the same rules as has been being followed, if Ryan's stuff is off limits to the girls then the girls stuff is off limits to Ryan regardless if he's jealous or not, this was how he wanted it when he had control and now his selfishness bites him in the ass.\n\nSecondary solution would be to buy a ps4 for the girls room and move the ps5 to the living room and mandate usage time.\n\nRegarding the spouses response to whats happening, its childish and if she doesn't see the fault in her line of thinking and is choosing to invoke the silent treatment, I'd say its best for all parties that the relationship ends and you go your separate ways, 2 people with children  settleing arguments using childish tactics will only end badly down the line. \n\nESH", "Yes..logically..but you don't do that by spiking him against sisters like that so dramatically. Instead of having a real long talk with the guy, he rather just buy a PS5 for his daughters and explicitly tells them not to share. That is not the right approach.", "NTA, and Ryan can learn a good lesson after being played at his own game. Whether or not he learns that lesson is entirely upto his mother.\nAlso I'm stoked in a petty way for your daughters, it must kill the kid they have a ps5 due to his own actions.", "Turnabout is fair play. NTA", "Seriously NTA and are you sure you want to marry someone who thinks that sharing is important only when it benefits her kid??? Imagine what it would be like for the twins to have THAT as a stepmother.", "Well the girls are already sharing,  with each other  while Ryan has one to himself.", "not that it really matters to the verdict, but OP is a her as well\n\nclearly NTA", "Thanks! i corrected it.", "NTA and I think you might've dropped your crown somewhere, absolute madlad of a mother your twins have. You are 100% on the right.", "NTA - but you need to address this issue with your fianc\u00e9e now.

You've watched her put your kids on second fiddle for so long and now watching her call them names for doing exactly what she supported.

You're both raising them to hate each other, which will eventually lower their feelings for both of you as well. \n\nSpend more time with your children.

Still I think op is NTA", "Why should she? Her fianc\u00e9e let her kid keep his OP has the same right.", "Yes, I would certainly parent based on what Melania would want .. gross. And as someone else pointed out, the girls are already sharing with each other.", "Did you even read the post? First off, OP is a woman. Second, she did tell them to share. Just because they didn't want to right at that moment doesn't mean they never do."]}
