She is your fianc\u00e9, so obviously you both are planning on a future together.  You need to devise a structure for your family. Parenting separately is NOT going to work.  I understand that it\u2019s not always possible to parent the exact same way when you have co-parents outside of the home involved. But for the time the kids are in YOUR HOME you need to be on the same page.  You have to start thinking of yourselves as two parents with four children - not my kids vs her kid.  You need to both agree, +/- compromise, how to move forward and stick to it. If there\u2019s a question of favoritism down the road, address is privately, not in front of the kids.

Please do this now before you get married.", "Her son not wanting the girls to play on it whether he\u2019s there or not or watch him play is perfectly understandable.

So going with ESH (directed at the adults, not the kids).\n\nYou have both already set the precedent that your kids will be treated separately. This is appalling.\n\nI'm not saying that the kids should share everything equally all of the time, but they have to learn to get along and co-exist. You and your partner are encouraging them to be territorial and petty over their space and belongings.", "Honestly I think both of you are(her more so than you). She is for allowing her son to act that way in the first place and then getting upset when it is turned around onto her and her child. You are because instead of sitting down and discussing your concerns and the issue of sharing and your twins getting their own, you just have the mentality of \u201cwell if your kid can act selfish then so can mine\u201d. You\u2019re both acting immature and not taking the opportunity to grow a caring, sharing family dynamic.\n\nESH.", "YTA. I disagree that there is no longer a reason to share. Had you purchased the twins a PS4 this would be true. But the twins have a superior console and everyone knows it. If you insist on pretending that all things are equal and allow the girls to continue denying Ryan access to their new console Ryan and your fiancee will justifiably think you're being TA. You should sit Ryan down and discuss how being selfish and not sharing wasn't a problem when it was him who was doing it and try to get him to see that the way he feels now is how he made the girls feel. You can still turn this into a valuable lesson about sharing for all of the children if you approach it right. Pretending like \"everyone has a console now\" is the end of the story will make Ryan resent you and the twins through no fault of their own. It also teaches the twins not to share.\n\nI would seek a compromise with the children that involves swapping consoles occasionally. My best friend growing up had an arrangement with his older brother over the gaming consoles in the house. They regularly swapped out who had the new vs old playstation, as required by their parents. Not to say there weren't disagreements, but it was far more fair than one person getting sole access to the newest console on the market.\n\nYou're really just replacing one inequality for another and reinforcing selfishness. \n\nEdit: grammar. Added the last sentence.", "This kid is 14 years old, a teenager in his phase..of course he doesn't want to hang out with the 2 younger sisters, are you dumb ? Now, again, i get you want to teach him a lesson, but you're taking the wrong approach.

Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right as much as you might want them to. Teaching the girls the value of sharing and compassion and compromise at an early age will benefit them in the long run.

But now that they have a better one, they have to swap it equally with his?\n\nThat would just teach Ryan that he always gets the sweet end of the deal.\n\nI agree that this situation and solution sucks, but teaching the girls that Ryan doesn\u2019t have to share until something better comes along for them isn\u2019t the answer either.", "This kid is 14 yo and should already understand the concept of sharing and not always getting his way, this is his mother's failing, not the OP's, not the OP's daughters', and not the PS5's", "Both are female \u263a\ufe0f", "Right which is why I said her more so than him but they\u2019re both acting childish and setting a poor example.", "Agreed, best solution would have been to simply buy a ps4 for the girls and been done with it. Buying a ps5 now makes ryan jealous cause he's naturally gonna want to play the newer console. \n\nHowever the kids aren't to blame for any of this, its 100% on the parents, they both screwed up when they didn't establish proper sharing of the ps4 to begin with, they screwed up again when they allowed sharing of the new ps5, if the rule was the girls can't play the ps4 cause its Ryan's and its in his room then they should never have allowed sharing the ps5 cause its the girls and in their room, you can't have different sets of rules for different children.\n\nWhat can they do about it now? The only fair thing is to apply the same rules as has been being followed, if Ryan's stuff is off limits to the girls then the girls stuff is off limits to Ryan regardless if he's jealous or not, this was how he wanted it when he had control and now his selfishness bites him in the ass.\n\nSecondary solution would be to buy a ps4 for the girls room and move the ps5 to the living room and mandate usage time.\n\nRegarding the spouses response to whats happening, its childish and if she doesn't see the fault in her line of thinking and is choosing to invoke the silent treatment, I'd say its best for all parties that the relationship ends and you go your separate ways, 2 people with children  settleing arguments using childish tactics will only end badly down the line. \n\nESH", "Yes..logically..but you don't do that by spiking him against sisters like that so dramatically. Instead of having a real long talk with the guy, he rather just buy a PS5 for his daughters and explicitly tells them not to share. That is not the right approach.", "NTA, and Ryan can learn a good lesson after being played at his own game. Whether or not he learns that lesson is entirely upto his mother.\nAlso I'm stoked in a petty way for your daughters, it must kill the kid they have a ps5 due to his own actions.", "Turnabout is fair play.

Either everyone shares or no one does. Might as well even go ahead and point out that the reason you got one for your girls is because  her son refused to share. She didn\u2019t make him share, so why on earth should you make your girls share??", "NTA\n\n> She called me an AH and said I was raising the girls to be selfish.\n\nSo your daughters get different rules than her son? Is she admitting that it\u2019s appropriate for her son to be selfish? Is it because she favors her kid, or because she\u2019s engaging in sexism?\n\nAlso I think it\u2019s worth pointing out one reason the girls may be unwilling to share with himcis because her son refused to share at every turn. It sounds like they are sharing with each other.\n\nI\u2019m actually not opposed to the rule a kid\u2019s stuff is theirs, especially in a blended household - but it should be consistent. Not a rule for one kid, but not others. That immediately communicates favoritism.", "NTA and you are a good mom", "NTA\n\nYour partner's a hypocrite, and she raised her son to be selfish. The boy got what he gave out.", "Exactly! Sound like a \"my kid is our kid but your kids are just yours\" kind of situation.\n\nNTA. Don't give in OP, stand up for your daughter's.", "This is what I was thinking. OP is NTA, but will be if she marries her fianc\u00e9 knowing that the fianc\u00e9 treats her twins poorly.", "husband and wife are two completely different words. fianc\u00e9 and fianc\u00e9e are the same word with slightly different spellings. its obviously an easy and insignificant mistake to make, everyone knows what they mean. grammatical gender is not deeply rooted in english like it is in french.", "Yeah, that annoys me too! \u270b\ufe0f", "That word exists, it\u2019s betrothed. It\u2019s clunky as fuck, but it exists.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t call your wife your husband, so don\u2019t call your fianc\u00e9e your fianc\u00e9.", "Probably the French.", "Words have meanings. Some of those words meanings imply gender. You wouldn\u2019t call your wife your husband, so don\u2019t call your fianc\u00e9e your fianc\u00e9.\n\nIf we\u2019re correcting people misgendering others (which we should be doing) we should be consistent in doing it.", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f. No Shit, Who Cares! It's a post about sharing a game system. Not Gender wording!!", "Agreed, to be honest I feel like we're getting close to the point where fiance is acceptable as a gender-neutral spelling for either.", "You aren't wrong, but the two words could be a little more different. I don't blame people for mushing them together when they sound the same", "and in that case we should definitely be trying to piss off the french", "what we SHOULD be doing realistically is getting rid of unnecessarily gendered words actually, especially when i\u2019m pretty sure this woman wasn\u2019t misgendering her own significant other"]}
