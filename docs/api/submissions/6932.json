My best friend and I have known each other since high school and have been attached at the hip since then. My sister and I don\u2019t have the best relationship but my parents and even my best friend said I should make her maid of honor as it was expected to I did. I\u2019m closer with my best friend but she said she didn\u2019t want to cause a family feud and she was happy being one of my bridesmaids.\n\nSo I made my sister maid of honor and she, my mom and my best friend went wedding dress shopping with me. Even before the trip my sister had made snide remarks about my wedding ring. It\u2019s a blue sapphire because I thought plain diamonds were boring but blue diamonds are insanely expensive so I got a sapphire. She made comments to our uncles and my parents that my fianc\u00e9e is cheap because he didn\u2019t get me a diamond. I tried to let it go but this time was too much.\n\nI tried on a few large princess style dresses but then decided I wanted to try on some more fitted styles. I tried on a mermaid style and walked out and she said loudly that my stomach was hanging out and it (the dress) wasn\u2019t the one for me. To be honest I didn\u2019t feel the best in the dress but her saying that loud enough for all the staff and other customers to hear was so humiliating. I walked backed into the dressing room and cried and the girl who was working with me told me I should take some time. I left without anything because I was so upset. My sister has made body shaming jokes at me before but because I gained some pandemic weight I was very sensitive to it now. \n\nI went home and the next day told her she had been downgraded to guest. She was furious and is accusing me of causing drama and making her the bad guy when she was just giving me advice. My parents are on her side saying she is still my sister and nothing is thicker than blood. I told my best friend she is now the maid of honor and we have planned another shopping trip with just her and my mom. My mom thinks since I did gain weight the fat shaming comment wasn\u2019t unjustified so I\u2019m even debating leaving her out of it.

Your sister is unkind and her \"support and advice\" is mean-spirited, so you're making this choice and ask them to all get behind you. Or at the very least accept your decision and move on. Good luck to you, have a beautiful wedding!", "NTA\n\nThis is definitely not the last of hurtful things she will say or drama she will cause.", "NTA. Don't make people maid of honor unless they are worth of it. Don't do things due to being pressured.", "NTA and tell mom that if she continues to be on your sisters side and make rude comments about your body that she isn\u2019t going to be involved in any more of the wedding planning, including dress shopping. Give her one chance. If she blows it  stick to your guns and tell mom she\u2019s welcome as a guest but the rest of the wedding will be planned by you, your new MOH and your fianc\u00e9. Sisters don\u2019t automatically become MOH just because they\u2019re sister. I was a bridesmaid for my sister, didn\u2019t even expect that, and NEVER would have demanded to be MOH. Of course I was only 12 at the time, but the point is still valid.", "And sapphires are beautiful!", "Right? Sapphires are gorgeous.", "\"Blood may be thicker than water but cheese dip is thicker than blood so technically queso is more important than family\" - source unknown (the wisdom of the internet). Send your sister (and parents if necessary) a coupon to Taco Bell.\n\nNTA", "Omg, I need this in my life. Can I please steal it?", "NTA\n\nNothing is thicker than blood? Bull! Maple syrup is thicker thank blood, and therefore pancakes are more important thank family using their logic. And sticking with this line of thinking, please nickname your BFF Pancakes, make her your MOH, and ditch your 'family'. Family are those who hold you up and support you, not treat you like garbage and trample you down. Your folks and sister don't deserve you.", "NTA\n\nYou should have responded to your sister, \"since we are all being honest, I guess you won't mind me calling you an AH!\"", "NTA, she is a bully. And believe me you will have many people in your life that are not blood relatives that will be on your side no matter what. Ask your friend to step up and stick to your guns. MOH should support you, not humiliate you.", "Tell mommy dearest she\u2019s uninvited as well NTA", "NTA. Concrete is thicker than blood. And your sister deserved the downgrade. If they keep it up, downgrade them to \"uninvited\".", "NTA, tell your mom she can zip it or not be invited. Why would you want people at your wedding that aren't supportive of you and make you feel terrible?", "NTA but you should have never made her the maid of honor in the first place. It wasn't a position she earned, or one that you wanted her to have. Have the wedding you want and stop letting other people dictate it.", "NTA my sister is similarly toxic and I got roped into making her a bridesmaid in my wedding. Thank God no one expected her to be my MOH. She did everything she could to be difficult then by the time she arrived (late) to get ready she made the rest of the morning about her and caused my mom to miss out on me getting ready. Even my mom admitted afterwards she shouldn\u2019t have made such a big deal over her being a bridesmaid and she should\u2019ve been a guest. Hell I wouldn\u2019t have cared if she didn\u2019t show. April will be 13 years since I got married and while I love my wedding and once the ceremony started my sister was fine it\u2019s still upsetting to remember all the ways I had to deal with her snark and meanness. It\u2019s not worth it. Cut your losses now and move on.\n\nBTW I made my best friend of 5 years(at that time) my MOH and it was great! We\u2019re still super close to this day and she ended up marrying my husband\u2019s best friend.", "NTA. Screw your sister, she was being a B for no reason. You are closer to your best friend so, she deserves it, if you think so. \nAlso, hello blue sapphire twin! I have a princess cut and I love it.", "Is there a new thing Bridesmaidzilla or mother of the Bridezilla?\n\nYou've gained weight so she is allowed to body shame a bride? Mom agrees? Yeeesh!!!!\n\nEveryone should be on the bride's side unless she's going Bridezilla and you have done nothing apparent to me.\n\nKeep sister where she is. She overstepped, \n\nMom needs to hear that the same could happen to her, If she's paying for it say you'll elope if she doesn't help you have a stress-free wedding. You don't need to mean it, but she should probably hear it. or maybe say a work friend said this too you as you sister is ridiculous, and mom is enabling a bad sister.\n\nNTA", "Nta\n>My parents are on her side saying she is still my sister and nothing is thicker than blood. \n\nNope, syrup is thicker than blood. \n\nYour parents are on some bullshit and your sister is being mean. I\u2019m so sorry for that experience, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll look beautiful in your dress.", "NTA... My sister and I have only gotten close in recent years. I wasn't in her wedding and she wasn't in mine. We were guests. You do what's best for you.", "NTA\n\nFor this statement...\n\n> My mom thinks since I did gain weight the fat shaming comment wasn\u2019t unjustified so I\u2019m even debating leaving her out of it\n\nLeave your mom out of it as well.", "NTA. Disinvite your mom from that shopping trip if she is going to justify your sisters horrible comments. You deserve to feel happy and beautiful during your celebration, and they are not helping you.", "From inside the venue to the parking lot perhaps? Especially if they think weight shaming comments when they're trying on wedding dresses and planning for a potentially momentous and life changing day are alright just because someone's body changed.", "We should be friends. Caramel is my fave and it IS thicker than blood.", "I \u2764\ufe0f", "Ice cream is thicker than all of them. Let\u2019s make sundaes! \ud83c\udf68", "Blood is thicker than milk is the phrase I like.", "Also lots of things are thicker than water, blood isn't special. Molasses is thicker than  water, blood, and syrup, so go make some ginger molasses cookies", "NTA, but I think you should look at the fact that your parents and your sister aren't supportive of you and wonder whether or not they should even be involved in your wedding at all.\n\nThey have not acted loving to you in any way, and have gone out of their way to treat you like dirt and speak down to you and your fiance. It doesn't sound like the support your marriage, why are they even still being invited to your wedding, let alone being involved in the wedding planning?", "Any chance your sister is annoyed that you are getting married or to whom you are getting married?", "NTA.  I just got married recently (2nd marriage for me, first for him, if that matters), and my family could have cared less.  They had no interest in our plans, didn't want to be involved in any part of it. So they weren't. It hurt me at the beginning, but my friends rallied around us.  They we're excited, energetic and positive.  Every single task was fun because of them.  We had the best day ever.  Even our photographer commented on how much love and laughter was evident on the day.  \nSurround yourself with YOUR group that will find the love and laughter.  The ones who want your day to celebrate the two of you.\nYou won't regret it.  Trust me \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA I wouldn't even invite her to the wedding. And I'd reassess mom and dad attending if they keep making excuses for her", "Anytime someone hits me with a \u201cBlood is thicker than water\u201d I hit \u2018em back with the \u201ctell me about it takes FOREVER to get it out of clothes\u201d it can be used as an intimidation tactic, or if that effect doesn\u2019t work GROSS THEM OUT go into detail about how Water isn\u2019t strong enough to get menstrual blood stains out. They will avoid that phrase around you for the rest of their lives", "NTA. Shopping for a gown is emotional. There are ways of saying a gown is not flattering without being insulting about it.\n\nNothing wrong with a sapphire. My concern would be that it\u2019s not as hard as a diamond and might chip more easily, but look at that giant honking one of Princess Diana\u2019s that Kate Middleton now wears. It\u2019s gorgeous. I would have thrown that in your sister\u2019s face.\n\nI think it\u2019s brilliant that you demoted your sister not just to bridesmaid but all the way down to guest. She acted hatefully.\n\nMy son recently married. His wife had two friends as attendants. Her sister was a guest. She gets along with her sister just fine but did not choose her as a bridesmaid or MOH. Nothing was said to her about it AFAIK.\n\nYou are under no obligation to have your sister in your wedding party. It is your choice alone. Do not let your sister or mother pressure you into doing it, especially after your sister\u2019s loathsome behavior.\n\nNTA.", "Don\u2019t let anyone steal your joy. Not even family. NTA", "NTA. It is your wedding, you get to choose who you have in the wedding party.  It is not compulsory that you have siblings in it.", "op=NTA  AND leave your mother at home\n\nHowever, you really need to steel up that spine, you are at wet noodle stage.\n\nYou let your sister be your maid of honor because that's what your family wanted(not you).  You took her dress shopping where she fat-shamed you and your mother supported her.  \n\n\nPS: Quit letting your sister shame your ring.  A blue sapphire sounds lovely.

Good boundaries as to how you do and do not want to be treated! \n\nYes, leave your mother out of the next wedding dress shopping trip. She\u2019ll probably keep pestering you about your sister. Shut that down by refusing to discuss it further.\n\nNow is your fresh start to having a blast with your friend planning /your/ wedding, the way you want it. Leave the past behind and have a great shopping trip with your friend.\n\nDon\u2019t let your sister or anyone else ruin your planning or wedding day.
