My best friend and I have known each other since high school and have been attached at the hip since then. My sister and I don\u2019t have the best relationship but my parents and even my best friend said I should make her maid of honor as it was expected to I did. I\u2019m closer with my best friend but she said she didn\u2019t want to cause a family feud and she was happy being one of my bridesmaids.\n\nSo I made my sister maid of honor and she, my mom and my best friend went wedding dress shopping with me. Even before the trip my sister had made snide remarks about my wedding ring. It\u2019s a blue sapphire because I thought plain diamonds were boring but blue diamonds are insanely expensive so I got a sapphire. She made comments to our uncles and my parents that my fianc\u00e9e is cheap because he didn\u2019t get me a diamond. I tried to let it go but this time was too much.\n\nI tried on a few large princess style dresses but then decided I wanted to try on some more fitted styles. I tried on a mermaid style and walked out and she said loudly that my stomach was hanging out and it (the dress) wasn\u2019t the one for me. To be honest I didn\u2019t feel the best in the dress but her saying that loud enough for all the staff and other customers to hear was so humiliating. I walked backed into the dressing room and cried and the girl who was working with me told me I should take some time. I left without anything because I was so upset. My sister has made body shaming jokes at me before but because I gained some pandemic weight I was very sensitive to it now. \n\nI went home and the next day told her she had been downgraded to guest. She was furious and is accusing me of causing drama and making her the bad guy when she was just giving me advice. My parents are on her side saying she is still my sister and nothing is thicker than blood. I told my best friend she is now the maid of honor and we have planned another shopping trip with just her and my mom. My mom thinks since I did gain weight the fat shaming comment wasn\u2019t unjustified so I\u2019m even debating leaving her out of it.

I'm sure you'll look beautiful in the dress you choose.\n\nThat being said, choosing someone else besides your sister can have lasting consequences in your relationship with your sister and family.

You\u2019re not obligated to make your sister you MOH just because she\u2019s yours sister! Lots and lots of women pick their best friend over a sister that they\u2019re not close with. Second, she should be demoted as all of what she has said is rude, disrespectful and insulting. Why would you want someone like that to help support you on one of the biggest days of your life??!!
