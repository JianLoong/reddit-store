Seriously consider getting your expectations and finances in order as a family unit.", "ESH, she - for not planning a budget and STICKING to it, you - for assuming that 100k is a lot of money when you have such a big family. It's not anymore, not in today's economy. Also, she does have a job. Looking after 4 kids is a full-time job. That being said, she really does need a reality check into where all that money that you have goes into if you guys can't even afford milk for the kid.", "NTA - maybe the way you told her that she's not contributing might be a slightly YTA but you do have a solid point. \n\nYou both should sit down and create a budget so you can cut on some discretionary spending and figure out your actual situation so your bills get paid on time.\n\nShe is kinda ridiculous tbh thinking you could just leave your job and jump into one paying 150% more right off the gate, I don't know what kind of work you do but if you're not at the top of the ladder in your profession you might be able to do a change of companies and boost your pay a little. However, if as soon as you get a pay increase you piss all your money away without proper budgeting you'll still end up in the same place regardless of how much money you make.\n\nI know 4 kids is probably a lot to juggle for your wife but maybe she should consider getting a remote part time job to help with the bills at least in the short term.

She is a grown ass woman fully capable of getting a job rather than complaining that her husband doesn\u2019t make enough", "Yep. That would be the maximum child support for 4 kids in the state I'm living currently.", "For free? Just handed to her? Y\u2019all are missing the point of what I and the other guy were saying. She\u2019s ungrateful and lazy, any amount of money wouldn\u2019t be enough for her. Moreover, OP makes it clear in his post that the money would very likely be going to mom rather than the kids.", "Why are you assuming to know what somebody else meant? How could you possibly know it was a mistype?        \nI hate this part of Reddit. Just decide on something in your head and present it as fact. Gtfoh.         \n\nI asked as I was unsure if the OP mistyped in the post, and maybe clarified the mistype in a comment.

And someone else would be caring for my child. We decided to take the $200 per month loss and have me stay home.", "Do you know how much daycare is? I pay $1200/month for ONE kid. And that's even if you can get a spot.
