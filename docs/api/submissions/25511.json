However, if as soon as you get a pay increase you piss all your money away without proper budgeting you'll still end up in the same place regardless of how much money you make.\n\nI know 4 kids is probably a lot to juggle for your wife but maybe she should consider getting a remote part time job to help with the bills at least in the short term.

If you can't increase your pay maybe think of moving lateral and decrease your work load.", "Ok yeah. I\u2019m not surprised they\u2019re living paycheck to paycheck.", "She is very much aware. OP is a temporary wallet until his wife moves on. She's just angry she hasn't convinced some wealthier dude to blow her back out for $$$. When she finds that dude she'll jump ship and demand all the money a judge will allow.", "She could get a paying job then.\n\nSAHM isn't viable if you can't afford it.", "Isn\u2019t average salary in Atlanta around $70k. Sounds like they doing just fine.", "SAHM is a job for people who can afford to do so. If you're worried about your children drinking milk because you have no money, everyone who can have a job outside of the home should be doing so.", "there's no need for a financial advisor to tell him that a family of 6 living on 100k anywhere, but specially Atlanta is not doable. The wife needs to get a paying job.", "Depends on the ages of the kids. I can\u2019t imagine childcare costs for 4!!", "If they have to get childcare, it may not be worth it. Childcare is an insane expense\u2026", "For one adult, 70k is more than enough. For 6 people, though, four of which are constantly growing kids with educational expenses, it's really not that much.", "The point is that they may not be able to afford childcare. I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s hard to understand. As in, if she gets a job & she\u2019s also paying taxes & they have to pay for outside childcare, they could potentially lose money. The kids are all here so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s the option to simply not have so many kids. She should get a job, yes, but depending on their ages, it may not make financial sense to do so\u2026", "Unless she has a toddler, i bet all their kids go to school and/or kinder, she can get a part time job instead of telling her husband to get a better paying job. It's doable."]}
