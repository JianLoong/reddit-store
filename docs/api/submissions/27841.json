After dinner we planned to go get a small cake and go home but since it was still a bit early I suggested that we go for a walk by the river since it was a romantic night and all but my wife didn\u2019t feel like it so I kept on suggesting places to go and she keeps on kind of laughingly saying no, so I thought looks like there is a surprise for me and i was about to get super lucky tonight so I said with a smile \u201calright home it is then\u201d she said \u201cyou mentioned all the places but the one I want to go\u201d so I asked her where she said  \u201cdrop off at the gym\u201d I honestly was shocked and I was like wtf is going on are you for real?? And she was said yeah it\u2019s fine I can go workout for a couple of hours then come back and we continue out day I was out of words and I just drove her to the gym silently, she asked me if I was mad, I told her that I was not mad but disappointed as I thought she was planning something special for me and she said yeah it\u2019s fine I\u2019m just going to workout for a bit, I told told her that it was such a shitty selfish thing to do and to please just stop talking and go to the gym. She then refused to get out of the car and told me to drive home and that I was unbearable to live with no matter how hard she tries to do something special for me I ruin it and that i\u2019m such an asshole for ruining this day. Am I the asshole? \nOh and when we got back home she went to the bathroom for an hour maybe she came back with a bathrobe on I thought she\u2019s gonna take it off and would have something sexy underneath but no she just wanted to talk about why did i have to ruin today she could\u2019ve went to the gym and came back without all this shit, so I just got up and went to sleep.", "created_utc": 1695949975, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16uxu5w/aita_for_telling_my_wife_30f_that_she_ruined_my/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can go to the gym any day, and you just wanted to spend time with her!\n\nIt\u2019s like the dinner was the one thing she was willing to do, and then her responsibility to pretend she cared was done.

If she needed to work out, she should have done so before/after celebrating your birthday.  \n\nYou know if you are childless, you could cheaply divorce her and adopt a dog that will always be excited to see you and spend time with you, right?", "NTA - Does she normally try to gaslight you?", "The question here is how much time was available?", " NTA. That is really rude and unloving behavior from your wife. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA. It sounds like you wanted to spend time with her and she was looking to get away from you. I read your comment that dinner was over at 7:30 or 8 PM. Working out for a couple hours means she'd be home around or after 10. You're not owed sex, but I don't think that's the issue because it sounds like you'd have been happy to walk around with her.\n\nDoes she usually not want to spend a lot of time with you?", "NTA, but I'm trying to figure out this comment:\n\n>no matter how hard she tries to do something special for me I ruin it\n\nNothing in your story sounds like she did something special *for you*.

She is trying to reverse it so you don't focus on how she is acting. I would have a serious conversation with her behavior. Write it out what she does and what you do and how you and her react and approach it with a clear head. If she keeps shifting the conversation to just blame then take it from there.", "NTA.  Incredibly inconsiderate wife.  She must not value you or your marriage.  Life is too short to live with that kind of treatment.", "Esh", "Can we please stop pretending like birthdays are all that special? You're not 7 anymore, you've had a few birthdays since then. A dinner is nice when you can swing it, but the whole day doesn't have to be about the Birthday Boy/Girl/whatever, especially if you don't have plans. She should have just said \"I'd like to go to the gym\" instead of having OP play a guessing game, but grow up. If you want to do more, you can plan it. If there are no further plans, you can't get mad at someone else for having their own plans. People who insist on \"birthday weeks\" are even worse.", "Info: what times did you get out of work, and what time did she want to go to the gym?", "NTA - she\u2018s in your head and you\u2019re doubting yourself. You\u2019re allowed to enjoy your birthday but clearly she had no intention of helping that to happen - quite the opposite in fact. Just because you\u2019re married doesn\u2019t mean a partner can quit trying. It\u2019s either counseling or a divorce is on the horizon.", "There are two clarifications that would help me\u2026 Do you know she was actually going to the gym to work out? Is it possible she had some sort of surprise? From your message, the wording doesn\u2019t mention working out. Just the gym.", "Lol naivety I guess, or it was just a wish because if she did that then I would\u2019ve forgotten everything shitty happened that day", "Wondering this. Gym or Jim?", "It was around 8pm", "I wouldn\u2019t say that our relationship is perfect we have our issues but we\u2019re both trying hard to fix it, and that\u2019s what disappointed me even more cause she told me during dinner that we should put everything behind us and start over. She doesn\u2019t owe me sex of course but she\u2019s my wife and it\u2019s my birthday am i wrong for wanting to spend the day with her?", "Because according to her the dinner was just the start of the night she had more plans for me but i ruined the day", "My only guess is that she had something planned and was using the gym as a cover for the amount of time it would have taken to implement the plan. That would explain the refusal of every single suggestion too", "Disagree... gender has nothing to do with it, from where I'm standing. Why do grown-ass adults insist on having Their Big Special Day every year? OP had dinner plans, dinner was over, and there were no further plans. If you want to do a bigger birthday, plan on doing more.", "In what way does OP suck?", "You can\u2019t be fucking serious. Dude got home after WORK at 4:30 PM to spend the night with her and she wants to spend the night at the god damned gym? Who even goes to the gym after dinner?!?! And here\u2019s little miss Ricky to tell men they shouldn\u2019t care about their own birthday. Well I hope you never get a birthday/Christmas/anniversary/valentines/Mother\u2019s Day ANYTHING ever again.", "I got out of work at 4:30 went straight home picked her up and we were at the restaurant at 5:30ish, we got out of the restaurant around 7:30 or 8", "Hard NTA. Your expectations were 100% reasonable. Her behavior is very off putting and I can understand why you felt hurt. I'd feel hurt, too. You were not asking for a birthday month, a birthday week or even a full birthday day. You were asking for the evening. That is TOTALLY normal. What is not normal is your spouse dipping to go to the gym after dinner.", ">She doesn\u2019t owe me sex of course but she\u2019s my wife and it\u2019s my birthday\n\nAnd *there it is*.\n\nAnything you say before the word \"but\" might as well not be there. \n\nBecause she's your wife and it was your birthday, you somehow landed on the idea that you were getting sex as a present. Throughout the entire post, you keep going back to the idea that she had some \"sexy surprise\" planned for you. Even after she was clearly annoyed with you and asked you to just take her home, you still jumped straight to, \"oh, I bet she has something sexy on under her robe, I'm getting lucky!\"\n\nYou. Are. Never. Owed. Sex. \n\nNot from your wife, not on your birthday, not even from your wife on your birthday. Not because you complimented her, not because she said \"let's start over\".\n\nYou're not an asshole for wanting to spend time with her... it's the *specific way* you wanted to spend time with her, and fixing it in your head that this was the present you should have gotten, and then getting pissy about not getting it, that means YTA. \n\nIf you two are at the point where you're trying to fix your problems, and enough things have happened that you've gotten to \"putting *everything* behind you and starting over\"? Then I'd hazard a guess that a whole lot has gone down that you didn't share here. Starting over might mean starting at the beginning again. It might mean sex is off the table for a while. \n\nTonight was when she said \"start over\"- I'd sit down and have an open discussion with her about what exactly \"starting over\" means to her. And work on a plan together, if you're genuinely interested in fixing things.", "Info: What is the everything you should put behind you?", "Had you considered she might have needed the time that you were at the gym to set something up? \n\nBad idea on her part but if it's the only thing she could come up with I could see it. \n\nJust a thought.", "LOL what obvious horseshit. She was looking for an excuse to blame you for her lack of making an effort. There were no plans.", "NTA for sure. That's a birthday dinner you were having. I'd be pretty upset if my wife decided to go do her own thing after my birthday dinner.", "Nothing huge no cheating or anything on both sides, the biggest issue we faced was that I had some issues with her family cause her sister would come and stay with us at our home for weeks at first i was fine with it then it got pretty annoying and because we couldnt be 100% ourselves with her sister around and I hated that I have to restrain myself at home and her sister felt that I was not comfortable so she got mad and my wife got mad at me  because of this and we had alot of fights about this shitty thing cause she thinks i was rude to her sister."]}
