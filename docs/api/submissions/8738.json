Or just flat out not pay?", "YTA.\n\nYou asked for a commission. They did the artwork, spent a lot of time on it. And thus need to get paid. \nYes, you might ask for some changes or stuff. But you have to pay either way, as you used up their time and pay them for it.", "YTA you definitely should have been more clear on what you wanted, or asked for progress pictures so you could change it. As an artist myself, I would be PISSED if I spent all that\u2019s time for a decently specific painting that I didn\u2019t want and nobody else would likely want.", "Yta, obviously.  Do you ask for your money back at the theater if you didn\u2019t like the movie you saw?", "YTA and for the record, when you commission a piece, you should know what the artist's skill level is and give as much details of what you want as you can.\n\nAn experienced artist will send you at least a sketch and progress pics and allow one or two revisions BEFORE the piece is finished.\n\nOnce the piece is finished and delivered, you pay for it. No ifs or buts, the artist provided you with a good, you owe them money.  \n\n\nTHE ONLY EXCEPTION I can think of is if the piece you got was not remotely what you commissioned or if you caught them stealing, tracing, or AI-generating it.", "YTA.\n\nThe artist sent you multiple sketches (also nice of you not to mention that on the main post).

Tweet Tweet ^_^", "Yeah, YTA. If an artist takes time and effort to make you a piece that *you* commissioned for, you have to pay for the time that they won\u2019t get back. I don\u2019t see how a person can commission another persons work if they didn\u2019t see their work beforehand. That\u2019s a good way for other artists to know not to accept commissions from you.

If you were sent sketches, that's on YOU to speak up if you're unhappy THEN, not once they finish it.

Next time make sure that\u2019s what you want. You owe them for whatever was discussed.

You commissioned the artist, they worked on the piece you wanted, and sent you sketches showing you the progression which you ignored.

Must be very bored as well as an AH.", "INFO. Did they send you an \u201calmost finished\u201d image and ask for input?  If they did and you approved it then YTA. \n\nI do commissions and take a deposit. This is non-refundable unless I don\u2019t do the work in promised time.  Then I send a update photo and if they see something wrong they can point it out.  This would be minor things such as if I\u2019m painting their dog from a photo and they realize their dog has lighter color eyes than in the photo they provided.  Obviously no big changes can be done. The artist has to be in contact", "YTA. You Asked someone to do work for you custom-made just for you.

You can't just not pay because you ended up not liking it.\n\nGenuinely wondering what you didn't like about it. Did the artist seriously mess up in some way?

You should have been more specific when you commissioned the piece.", "YTA, you chose not to look at early sketches.

You\u2019re being selfish and you absolutely scammed this person.
