So we spent a little over a week prepping, helping him \u201cstudy\u201d hamster care and dedicated a sizable spot in our living room for necessities and home.\n\nWe finally get around to picking one out at the pet shop, he\u2019s set on the name Sonic, but the lady ringing us up mentioned the one he picked out was a girl and that she could get him a boy if he wanted, and he just lit up and said \u201cThat\u2019s Amy!\u201d and that was that, we took Amy home. This was in March.\n\nMy sister-in-law found out she was pregnant somewhere around that time, and last month they found out they were having a girl. Basically what happened was, they were picking out names and one of the names they narrowed it down to had Amy as the middle name. I made a joke of something like \u201cHey, we already have an Amy at our house!\u201d Trying to be funny, but SIL didn\u2019t think it was. I didn\u2019t think much about it at the time, but a couple of days ago she asked to come by to talk.\n\nShe started off by saying the joke I made was in bad taste, I apologized for it, and then she suggested I change the name. I told her I didn\u2019t think that would go over well with my son, and then she outright demanded it be changed \u201cwhether he likes it or not\u201d because she wasn\u2019t going to have a child share the name with a hamster. I agreed to talk it over with my son to see what he thought, and of course he didn\u2019t want to, he even thought it was cool that his cousin would share her name with his hamster. I tried convincing him to rename her Sonic even, or some other Sonic character, but he didn\u2019t want that. I explained how SIL feels about this, and he felt a bit hurt because he thought he upset SIL but he really didn\u2019t want to change the name and didn\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t just share it.\n\nI told SIL that my son was set on Amy, and she blew up. I\u2019ll admit I got a bit defensive and reacted poorly, but I essentially told her it wasn\u2019t a huge deal, it\u2019s not like anyone is going to make the connection and by the time her child is old enough to know her name, Amy the Hamster likely won\u2019t be around. She claimed it was embarrassing because she would always know the connection in her mind, to which I simply told her if it was such a strong reminder of a hamster then maybe it wasn\u2019t a name she should use for her daughter.\n\nMy brother has told me that I am being selfish for not forcing my son to pick another name, SIL obviously thinks I\u2019m TA, and my mom has said the whole thing is childish.
