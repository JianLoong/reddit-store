I finally gave in when I felt we were ready to take one on, and also when I felt he was ready for the responsibility that comes with one. I expected a dog or cat, but he really wanted a hamster. So we spent a little over a week prepping, helping him \u201cstudy\u201d hamster care and dedicated a sizable spot in our living room for necessities and home.\n\nWe finally get around to picking one out at the pet shop, he\u2019s set on the name Sonic, but the lady ringing us up mentioned the one he picked out was a girl and that she could get him a boy if he wanted, and he just lit up and said \u201cThat\u2019s Amy!\u201d and that was that, we took Amy home. This was in March.\n\nMy sister-in-law found out she was pregnant somewhere around that time, and last month they found out they were having a girl. Basically what happened was, they were picking out names and one of the names they narrowed it down to had Amy as the middle name. I made a joke of something like \u201cHey, we already have an Amy at our house!\u201d Trying to be funny, but SIL didn\u2019t think it was. I didn\u2019t think much about it at the time, but a couple of days ago she asked to come by to talk.\n\nShe started off by saying the joke I made was in bad taste, I apologized for it, and then she suggested I change the name. I told her I didn\u2019t think that would go over well with my son, and then she outright demanded it be changed \u201cwhether he likes it or not\u201d because she wasn\u2019t going to have a child share the name with a hamster. I agreed to talk it over with my son to see what he thought, and of course he didn\u2019t want to, he even thought it was cool that his cousin would share her name with his hamster. I tried convincing him to rename her Sonic even, or some other Sonic character, but he didn\u2019t want that. I explained how SIL feels about this, and he felt a bit hurt because he thought he upset SIL but he really didn\u2019t want to change the name and didn\u2019t understand why they couldn\u2019t just share it.\n\nI told SIL that my son was set on Amy, and she blew up. I\u2019ll admit I got a bit defensive and reacted poorly, but I essentially told her it wasn\u2019t a huge deal, it\u2019s not like anyone is going to make the connection and by the time her child is old enough to know her name, Amy the Hamster likely won\u2019t be around. She claimed it was embarrassing because she would always know the connection in her mind, to which I simply told her if it was such a strong reminder of a hamster then maybe it wasn\u2019t a name she should use for her daughter.\n\nMy brother has told me that I am being selfish for not forcing my son to pick another name, SIL obviously thinks I\u2019m TA, and my mom has said the whole thing is childish.

It\u2019s a middle name too! How self absorbed and weird. Don\u2019t back down, don\u2019t do that to your son.", "NTA. Keep being an awesome mother and sticking up for your son", "I share the same name with my Ex BF dog, and still live a normal life. Everyone gets a chuckle, and then we move on. \n\nNTA", "Lol that\u2019s what I just said", "Nope change it to SILs name", "It's not even the first name. SIL is freaking out about a middle name that hardly anyone is going to know, much less use.", "Yes! Even if SIL goes with another name.", "Amy? Is that you??", "Tbh even if the hamster lives to 50 (lol!), SIL is still being stupid.", "The average lifespan of a poorly treated domestic hamster is 3 years. They should live up to 5. They live up to 8 in the wild.", "Too bad giant tortoises aren't good house pets.", "I mean theirs a character in the sonic cartoon called Amy rose. So technically he did name it after another sonic character", "No one tell her how many Amys there are out there. Let her find out the hard way.", "That's exactly the comment I was going to write. Glad I read other comments before posting.", "Right! How would they have known the cousin\u2019s MIDDLE name (not even first name!) would be Amy. \nIf the Hamster dies she claims it will still be a connection\u2026 wouldn\u2019t that connection still be there if the kid changes the name too???? \nThe mom is right- the whole thing IS childish. It\u2019s a hamster. I know a dog named Amy too\u2026 it isn\u2019t some uncommon/unique name.", "You can't change its name to miserable cow, that wouldn't be fair to the hamster \ud83e\udd23", "Oh yeah. I hardly use my children\u2019s middle names and even at daycare they don\u2019t know them either. \n\nThough pregnant women can be really weird and change due to hormones. I was such an angry MF when pregnant with my first so maybe she\u2019s just hormonal", "Totally true", "Google disagrees:\n\n>How long do hamsters live for as pets?\n\nOn average, hamsters live about 18-36 months, with the Syrian hamster breed more likely to live longer than dwarf varieties. Any hamster that is a year and a half old is considered elderly."]}
