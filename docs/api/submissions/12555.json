I want to know if I was wrong for not giving him the 10 pound, because it is only 10 pound, and if I should have resolved the conflict before leaving without him. Maybe he was actually ready, maybe I could have confirmed if he was definitely coming with me. When he called me the first time I could have gone back into the flat to get him and we could both leave. I could have answered his subsequent calls, although it would have made me late.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My boyfriend would have been appalled at the thought of asking to borrow money from me.  I mean, it just would never have occurred to him.  He had family trust funds and more money than he knew what to do with, but he maintained a strict budget because it was the responsible thing to do.  Seriously, he had \"fun\" money built into his budget (think \"mad money\" if you will).  The only thing he ever used it for was to buy gifts for me.  Since he put genuine thought into gift giving, he didn't go overboard on the expense there, either.  He heard me tell someone I thought cut roses from a gift shop were too expensive because they don't last long.  So he bought me rose bushes instead.  I'm a writer but I liked helping him tear down old barns/structures to reclaim the wood for new projects...so he bought me gloves to protect my hands from splinters, scratches, etc.  He knew I am absent minded, so he'd slip an umbrella just inside the screen door on rainy days just in case I'd lost my last one.  He passed away in 2019, but his inexpensive roses are still blooming, I just used those leather work gloves the other day, and the last umbrella he gave me is in my coat closet. \n\nYour boyfriend uses you as his private bank.
