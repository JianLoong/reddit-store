She's going to have to learn that the bridges she has burned in her life don't magically reappear when trajedy strikes. This may be the wake up call she needed, however harsh that may sound. You don't need to say anything to her, even though she's a cousin, it doesn't mean you owe her anything.", "NTA. You're under no obligation to send your condolences. That's the kind of thing we usually do for people who are an important part of our lives.", "NTA. Yeah it sucks that she\u2019s experiencing this,  and you\u2019d be golden if you sent her a card with a condolence greeting. But if you feel that reaching out to her directly would be a lifeline she would abuse, and has a history of doing so, then just send her a card; she has an unfortunate mental health problem but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to put your whole life on hold for someone who is unmedicated and out of control.", "NTA\n\nWhat has happened to her is very sad and potentially traumatic BUT you are absolutely right in your considerations.\n\nIn her situation and from her past behavior, you reaching out would only open you up to her focusing on as a new support again. Yet you would not be able to support her in this trying times either. Even more so since you cannot tell if she has at all changed her ways which would actually make you very vulnerable to be crushed by the situation.\n\nI feel your pain towards her situation but you are right. Do NOT touch this situation even with a ten foot poll.", "NTA\n\nIt's a very sad tragedy. However, boundaries are important with toxic people like her.", "YWNBTA. You're not required to reach out. Would it be kind and nice? Sure, but you are allowed to set boundaries for yourself that help keep you safe. It sounds like both you and your cousin could both stand to give yourselves some grace.", "NTA but I can tell you want to. Maybe give a prepaid food delivery voucher (*groceries!) in a card that says \"sorry for..\" \"thinking about..\" etc", "Nta you\u2019re not obligated to see someone who affected your life and your families lives the way she did", "NTA. I think sending a card with a voucher or some flowers would be appropriate- shows you\u2019re thinking of her but is still detached. Also means you don\u2019t have to have actual contact with her.", "NTA. You can empathise with people and still not want to be around them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
