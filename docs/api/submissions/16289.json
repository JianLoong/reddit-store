She's going to have to learn that the bridges she has burned in her life don't magically reappear when trajedy strikes. This may be the wake up call she needed, however harsh that may sound. You don't need to say anything to her, even though she's a cousin, it doesn't mean you owe her anything.", "NTA. You're under no obligation to send your condolences. That's the kind of thing we usually do for people who are an important part of our lives.", "NTA. Yeah it sucks that she\u2019s experiencing this,  and you\u2019d be golden if you sent her a card with a condolence greeting. But if you feel that reaching out to her directly would be a lifeline she would abuse, and has a history of doing so, then just send her a card; she has an unfortunate mental health problem but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to put your whole life on hold for someone who is unmedicated and out of control.", "NTA\n\nWhat has happened to her is very sad and potentially traumatic BUT you are absolutely right in your considerations.\n\nIn her situation and from her past behavior, you reaching out would only open you up to her focusing on as a new support again. Yet you would not be able to support her in this trying times either. Even more so since you cannot tell if she has at all changed her ways which would actually make you very vulnerable to be crushed by the situation.\n\nI feel your pain towards her situation but you are right. Do NOT touch this situation even with a ten foot poll.", "NTA\n\nIt's a very sad tragedy. However, boundaries are important with toxic people like her.", "YWNBTA. You're not required to reach out. Would it be kind and nice? Sure, but you are allowed to set boundaries for yourself that help keep you safe. It sounds like both you and your cousin could both stand to give yourselves some grace.", "NTA but I can tell you want to. Maybe give a prepaid food delivery voucher (*groceries!) in a card that says \"sorry for..\" \"thinking about..\" etc", "Nta you\u2019re not obligated to see someone who affected your life and your families lives the way she did", "NTA. I think sending a card with a voucher or some flowers would be appropriate- shows you\u2019re thinking of her but is still detached. Also means you don\u2019t have to have actual contact with her.", "NTA. You can empathise with people and still not want to be around them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if you are not religious, silently pray for her because, on so many levels, she needs help that you just cannot supply.\n\nIn short, don't get sucked into this.", "NTA.\n\nThis relationship is behind you now. If it helps with the negative feelings, I sincerely doubt that your cousin would take comfort from contact with you; with the issues she has, she might even feel like you're rubbing it in her face.\n\nLeave her be.", "Nta", "Sending any type of monetary gift would be very kind, but from OP\u2019s report, it would only open the door for cousin to ask for more, so it\u2019s probably not a good idea. Flowers and a card with no gift might be a better option.", "Given what you said about this cousin's history of stealing, lying, and abusing people, you will surely regret it if you open this door. Your expression of sympathy will surely appear to her as an opportunity. You WNBTA if you don't reach out.", "INFO: Are you sure she ACTUALLY had a stillbirth this time? Is it possible she was faking another pregnancy?  Is the information source a credible one? \n\nIt's possible that if she has that bad of a track record of lying, she could just be looking for the attention that comes from tragedy.", "NTA But also... do you have actual proof of a stillbirth? Even a pic of a late baby could have been stolen off the internet", "NTA. My advice would be to send a card, since a card offers your condolences, but it's a lot harder to latch onto than a text or a call.", "NTA. Some people are best avoided entirely.", "Yes. This is a good lesson in why altruism is valuable. When the chips are down others are there for you. But if you isolate yourself and don't form altruistic relationships... Reality is cold.\n\nNTA, a con artist is a dangerous acquaintance", "NTA I wouldn't bother. You cut ties for good reason. For all you know this could be another lie.", "YWNBTA. She's a predator. Stay away.", "NTA", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s just so hard to watch someone you care about self destruct the way she has. I truly don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad person despite everything. She\u2019s severely mentally ill and I don\u2019t know if she even realizes what she\u2019s done. That might be naive of me to say, but even then I know it\u2019s not an excuse. It\u2019s at the point where none of us can help her even if we wanted to.", "u/Throwaway_cousin8 this is the best response, no matter what, if you reach out at all, you will be opening yourself to be abused by her in one way or another. NTA. Maybe talk to a grief counselor about your guilt if it gets too bad, and maybe help someone else in a similar situation, donate to a women's shelter.", "You feel guilty because you\u2019re a good person with a good heart. But here\u2019s the thing - it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person to want to distance yourself from a very toxic person, even one who is experiencing trauma. You can remain no contact and still be sad for her. Edited to add: YWNBTA\n\nIf you feel the need to do something anyway, consider donating to a charity in the baby\u2019s honor. Or planting a tree. Or whatever would feel like a good way to honor them.", "She steals, lies and told lies about 2 men that could absolutely destroy their lives, had they not been proven false.\n\nHer mental health is her responsibility, no one else's. If she does not know what she is doing, then she needs to be institutionalized. But I suspect she does. Her behavior has consequences and those consequences is no one wants to be around her.", "OP if you want to offer sympathy without talking directly, maybe a condolence card? I didn't even know this was a thing before I lost my son, but we received them from friends/family that we'd had minimal/no contact with for years (mainly because we weren't close admittedly) for months after (assuming as the news spread down the grapevine) \n\nAlso, \ud83d\udcaf NTA", "YWNBTA- For all we know you might even set her on a new pathology of manufacturing illness or injury to get enough sympathy to be taken in. Reaching out to one of her parents to express sympathy and ask if there's any way you can help them help her get help, if that makes any sense, maybe, but reopening a door that's shut for a reason in this situation is something I'd want professional advice on, and if she doesn't have a diagnosis I'm not sure such a person exists. Let's hope that there will be some follow up counselling for her trauma and that sets her on the path to treatment of the pre-existing issues.", "NTA everything else in her life aside, if you aren\u2019t close, you don\u2019t have to directly reach out. If you feel you want to do something, you can send a card, or make a donation to a cause she cares about, if you know of one.  My sibling and their spouse lost their child this way, and in lieu of flowers they asked for people to donate to 2 charities that meant a lot to them.", "You WNBTAH, but you might want to think about being the bigger person, and expressing your sorrow for her anyway. She is obviously a hurting soul and it would cost you nothing to be kind. You can make it clear you are not contacting her to rescue her but to offer condolences. Be kind.", "That's just wishful thinking. Pathological liars and narcissists always, always spin reality around. She will say the world is against her"]}
