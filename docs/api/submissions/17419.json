I was a SAHM and always had been so I had no idea where to start. I'd never had a job and admittedly, I didn't even have my license. It was tough from every single angle but in short, I needed help so I decided to let my best friend \"Jesse\" (30m) and his wife \"Kim\" (29f) move in to a spare room to help pay rent. I immediately went for my license (passed first try) and quickly got a job. During this time my parents were helping with babysitting my kids and thankfully within 6 months, I had become comfortable with the \"adulting\" life style but we were all still grieving heavily, as I never really gave myself time to process the loss of my husband, nor did my babies really grasp that daddy wasn't coming home which made things much more difficult. \n\nSo anyways, my roommates have been fine for the most part but have recently started attempting to get me to party more, let loose and have fun. Things I'm still not even remotely comfortable with and I've expressed this multiple times. That and I have some unresolved trauma involving men from my childhood and don't really feel comfortable being around any guy while drinking. I'm working through that in therapy (started recently) but there's a long road ahead.\n\nWell, I picked my girls up from soccer practice yesterday and brought them out for ice cream. We got home around 6pm and there were 4 or 5 unknown cars in my driveway and I could hear the music blared. I walk inside to find easily 10+ people, mostly men, drinking, dancing and partying with my roommates. I immediately turned off the music and told everyone to leave. My roommates called me a poor sport and said I need to \"let go\". Between them having strange drunk men in me and my husbands home around my girls and not respecting my boundaries on no partying in general, I decided to evict them this morning. Where I had a lease already drawn up stating I could evict them at any time with a week notice, I only gave them 7 days to be out and I was within my rights to do so. They are saying I'm an AH for \"blindsiding them after all they've done for me\" but them having drunk guys in my house around my daughter's without even asking, KNOWING what I went through was not a situation I will ever forgive.

Your roommates are in no position to tell you to \u201clet go\u201d, not when you are processing the loss of a spouse, which can take years to come to terms with.

Sometimes you don't really know people until they show you who they are under trying circumstances.\n\nHaving tenants in your home sounds like a similar situation, but with an enhanced level of alertness. You set ground rules, establish boundaries, and hope for the best.  But again, you can never truly know a person.\n\nI can't say you're wrong for evicting them.  As a single mother your kids must be paramount.  People who will act counter to maintaining a safe environment for your family are not suitable tenants.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Most rental agreements give 30 days though, so the short-notice is kind of jerkish.\n\nEven though I don't know why they think having 10 plus people you don't know in your home with young kids there is ok.", "NTA.

I don't mean it in the way that everyone usually does. That you look put together on the outside.\n\nI mean you're strong because you're holding yourself together with pure determination for both yourself and the ones that need you most. A tragedy like yours can destroy a person.\n\nMaking it through that tragedy flawlessly isn't strength. Moving forward when you're screaming inside and want to claw your own face off, that's strength. When you cry every night because you miss him, but fighting to protect what your love made together every day, that's real strength.\n\nYou're allowed to cry and you're allowed to feel the pain and nobody has the right to rush you through that timeline. So long as you aren't harming yourself or others you have every right to manage things the way you have been.\n\nI won't claim to know anything about your husband.

I can only imagine how difficult losing your husband has been for you and your family.", "Nta foe evicting them but honestly you should have had a plan. Life insurance is cheap if you're under 40 and having a skill or plan for work could have saved you loads of stress. We are a single income family but both my husband and I have life insurance and plans in place in case of of us passes. You have too, especially if you have kids. FYI, my job is not very high paying either but we have managed to make it work. Sorry for your loss but I hope your planning for your child's future", "Whoever passed the landlord/tenant laws for your jurisdiction is TA for this being enforceable", "I would say, I do think you're overreacting based on how you've explained it... and you know it's an overreaction and that's why you've sought out therapy. \n\nSo, take this up with your therapist, not reddit, and see what they think.\n\nThese two friends were presumably close enough that you wanted them around after your husband passed away. Maybe remember that, and remember that they care for you, before allowing your strong emotional reaction to drive your friends away.\n\nThey pay rent to live there, and are therefore allowed to have guests and live NORMAL lives!", "Info: did you tell them they couldn\u2019t have men in the house or that no one could drink as a condition of living there?", "I'm going to go with ESH.\n\nThis is obviously a very complicated situation that a short post on Reddit and this response from me will not capture the full scope of. You mentioned that you have past trauma, in addition to grieving the loss of your husband, and I'm happy to hear you are getting help to work through those things.\n\nAs for your friends/roommates, it absolutely is shitty of them to have a party with no warning and you have every right to be upset about unexpectedly coming home to that. I also agree that they have no right to tell you to \"loosen up\" or \"let go a little\" or whatever other versions of that you've been told, because obviously only you get to decide what you're comfortable with.\n\nThat being said, despite the fact that they are living in the house you shared with your husband, they are still tenants, and they are still allowed to have friends over and drink with them. Common courtesy would suggest they notify you of this in advance, especially considering you have kids, but that's usually not how these things go, and I would say that it should be expected that these things will happen from time to time it may be your house, but you also agreed to take money from others to allow them to live there, which means that you don't get to control everything single thing they do while there; they also have rights as tenants. It's also entirely possible that they did not initially intend to make you uncomfortable by having several strange men there drinking, but rather that they invited an assortment of people, but the women hadn't arrived yet or one of the people told someone else who told someone else... So they wound up with a dynamic they did not intend to have, and that is what you came home to. Of course, this is all speculation.\n\nAs you've noted, you are well within your rights to evict them as per your lease agreement, but that's also not what you came here to ask. While legally you are absolutely in the right, I think that in terms of being an AH, you've both behaved poorly in this situation, and there was likely a course of action that would have had them still living there while also being more considerate of your situation. Instead, they have to scramble to find a new place to live while you (presumably) now need to look for another tenant to help cover your expenses, and there is no guarantee that they will be better.", "NTA because you\u2019re legally within your right and they were shitty having a party when the kids were going to home, against the rules etc. But YTA for giving them one week.", "I'm conflicted. I think kicking them out over something like this is extreme you could have just given them a warning and had a talk with them but I understand you were shocked and didn't want your kids around this.", "ESH. If they knew about your situation and that you didn't want parties then that was a really low move on their part, but at the same time 1 week to find a new place to live is a very short amount of time and sounds a lot like the landlord version of predatory lending. What's done is done, though, and I understand that renting out a spare room where you live with your children is much different than owning an entire apartment block.", "YTA. They were having friends round in their home. I appreciate it's your home too but even if you own it they still live their and it's theirs home. Asking them to keep it down after it gets late or whatever is fine (you don't say how late it was) but just kicking everyone out was an overreaction. If you can't share a space then you're probably best not having tenants or making sure you have tenants who are quieter, but even so giving them 7 days notice is too much at least give them a bit of time to find a new place to rent.", "YTA you\u2019re a landlord", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
