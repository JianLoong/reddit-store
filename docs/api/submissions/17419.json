I was a SAHM and always had been so I had no idea where to start. I'd never had a job and admittedly, I didn't even have my license. It was tough from every single angle but in short, I needed help so I decided to let my best friend \"Jesse\" (30m) and his wife \"Kim\" (29f) move in to a spare room to help pay rent. I immediately went for my license (passed first try) and quickly got a job. During this time my parents were helping with babysitting my kids and thankfully within 6 months, I had become comfortable with the \"adulting\" life style but we were all still grieving heavily, as I never really gave myself time to process the loss of my husband, nor did my babies really grasp that daddy wasn't coming home which made things much more difficult. \n\nSo anyways, my roommates have been fine for the most part but have recently started attempting to get me to party more, let loose and have fun. Things I'm still not even remotely comfortable with and I've expressed this multiple times. That and I have some unresolved trauma involving men from my childhood and don't really feel comfortable being around any guy while drinking. I'm working through that in therapy (started recently) but there's a long road ahead.\n\nWell, I picked my girls up from soccer practice yesterday and brought them out for ice cream. We got home around 6pm and there were 4 or 5 unknown cars in my driveway and I could hear the music blared. I walk inside to find easily 10+ people, mostly men, drinking, dancing and partying with my roommates. I immediately turned off the music and told everyone to leave. My roommates called me a poor sport and said I need to \"let go\". Between them having strange drunk men in me and my husbands home around my girls and not respecting my boundaries on no partying in general, I decided to evict them this morning. Where I had a lease already drawn up stating I could evict them at any time with a week notice, I only gave them 7 days to be out and I was within my rights to do so. They are saying I'm an AH for \"blindsiding them after all they've done for me\" but them having drunk guys in my house around my daughter's without even asking, KNOWING what I went through was not a situation I will ever forgive.

You mentioned that you have past trauma, in addition to grieving the loss of your husband, and I'm happy to hear you are getting help to work through those things.\n\nAs for your friends/roommates, it absolutely is shitty of them to have a party with no warning and you have every right to be upset about unexpectedly coming home to that. I also agree that they have no right to tell you to \"loosen up\" or \"let go a little\" or whatever other versions of that you've been told, because obviously only you get to decide what you're comfortable with.\n\nThat being said, despite the fact that they are living in the house you shared with your husband, they are still tenants, and they are still allowed to have friends over and drink with them. Common courtesy would suggest they notify you of this in advance, especially considering you have kids, but that's usually not how these things go, and I would say that it should be expected that these things will happen from time to time it may be your house, but you also agreed to take money from others to allow them to live there, which means that you don't get to control everything single thing they do while there; they also have rights as tenants. It's also entirely possible that they did not initially intend to make you uncomfortable by having several strange men there drinking, but rather that they invited an assortment of people, but the women hadn't arrived yet or one of the people told someone else who told someone else... So they wound up with a dynamic they did not intend to have, and that is what you came home to. Of course, this is all speculation.\n\nAs you've noted, you are well within your rights to evict them as per your lease agreement, but that's also not what you came here to ask. While legally you are absolutely in the right, I think that in terms of being an AH, you've both behaved poorly in this situation, and there was likely a course of action that would have had them still living there while also being more considerate of your situation. Instead, they have to scramble to find a new place to live while you (presumably) now need to look for another tenant to help cover your expenses, and there is no guarantee that they will be better.", "NTA because you\u2019re legally within your right and they were shitty having a party when the kids were going to home, against the rules etc. But YTA for giving them one week.", "I'm conflicted. I think kicking them out over something like this is extreme you could have just given them a warning and had a talk with them but I understand you were shocked and didn't want your kids around this.", "ESH. If they knew about your situation and that you didn't want parties then that was a really low move on their part, but at the same time 1 week to find a new place to live is a very short amount of time and sounds a lot like the landlord version of predatory lending. What's done is done, though, and I understand that renting out a spare room where you live with your children is much different than owning an entire apartment block.", "YTA. They were having friends round in their home. I appreciate it's your home too but even if you own it they still live their and it's theirs home. Asking them to keep it down after it gets late or whatever is fine (you don't say how late it was) but just kicking everyone out was an overreaction. If you can't share a space then you're probably best not having tenants or making sure you have tenants who are quieter, but even so giving them 7 days notice is too much at least give them a bit of time to find a new place to rent.", "YTA you\u2019re a landlord", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It ultimately depends on how much the tenants know and what they're willing to do. \n\nIllegal but not enforceable basically means that it's technically against the law, but cops/judges/the state aren't going to waste their time on a petty case or crime.\n\nAt the end of the day, she should follow state law so she doesn't land herself in hot water.

My point with the first comment of mine that you responded to was more that people seem to think that anything in a rental agreement goes when the law will always trump the rental agreement. For OP's sake, I'm glad she was able to evict them so quickly, but as someone who cares about rights of renters, be they lodgers or tenants, I hate it.", "And you're absolutely right to feel that way!

If this were a random stranger that were renting, absolutely not, they can gtfo, but I think that friend deserves a chance. Obviously just my opinion though", "It's different when the landlord is also residing in the home and sharing a kitchen with the tenants. Different rules apply to standard renting.", "In my state, the eviction process begins with a 72 hours notice. After that time is up, you go to court and from that day on, you have either 30 or 60 days (depending on how long the person has lived in the rental) to vacate the premises. I'd be very surprised to find that any state in the US would allow for a 7 day eviction process. It's not impossible, especially nowadays, but I'd still be surprised.", "Yes, and I\u2019m confident that I\u2019m the one describing reality.", "What you seem to be ignoring is that she had said no before they had the party. They simply ignored her wishes.", "Copamarigold is correct. There are many, many places where people can squat, and then it's up to the landlord to legally force them out. If they do it illegally, they can be on the hook for legal expenses, moving expenses, and other fees, not to mention lose an eviction case immediately and have to start over from the beginning. \n\nWhen dealing with difficult tenants, you need to know the law very very well so you don't screw yourself over.", "You would be wrong.", "Yeah, you're wrong. You can Google it or you can watch one of the many documentaries that exist that demonstrate that you are wrong.", "I saw a comment that said OP had expressed her wishes that she not have a bunch strange drunk men in her home. Which is why I pointed out that that may not have been the friends' intention when they decided to have a party. I may have missed it, but I did not see that OP explicitly said no parties or no to this particular party and that they decided to do it anyway. I do also think perspective matters in that evaluation as well. Were these men drunk, or talking and having a beer. I get that to OP the difference doesn't matter (and I don't know that I blame her), but to friends who are trying to respect her boundaries, would they have felt that these guys coming over for two beers would be okay. Sure it's splitting hairs potentially, but to them it could be the difference that made them think they were acting appropriately.\n\nRegardless, I still feel that evicting someone over a single party is extreme. That is not to say that the friends weren't wrong, because as I said I do think they were assholes for having a party when they knew kids would be around, and even more so for having it unannounced, but I think OP still sucks for jumping straight to eviction, especially given that these are friends. Friends fuck up, none of us are perfect, and so I think there is a very wide spectrum between \"hey you just disrespected my boundaries but that's totally fine please continue to do so\" and \" hey friend you disrespected my boundaries and I don't want to hear what reason or perspective you may have, gtfo\"", "No one claimed you can\u2019t squat in some circumstances .

There\u2019s a big difference. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t be a jerk about it.", "It def doesn't sound like there is an agreement.  Part of my problem is that 7 days notice doesn't sound legal.  Unless they were renting week to week, they are probably entitled to 30 days notice.   \n\nThat's what makes people like OP the worst landlords.  They take the money, but think the tenant has zero rights.", "The people living with OP are not considered tenants. They are considered lodgers. Tenants rights vs rights for lodgers are very different. Yes she can still go through the process of having them legally evicted and when granted they can possibly be put out in as little as 3 days.", "The above commentator is correct in my jurisdiction. If the owner lives on the premise you can more or less do whatever you want.\n\n\nI had a family member ruin an entire room of my home and get violent. They refused to leave and the eviction and paperwork took 3 days to process. Then the sheriff came. When  I spoke with my attorney, he said that if I felt my life was in danger we could have them removed the next day.", "I mean they signed it meaning they agree, but even when I evicted a roommate I gave them 30 Days. \n\nAt the same time, I wouldn\u2019t want people partying around my kids for a month either. I am saying NTA", "There are places that aren\u2019t California, with different laws.", "Technically OP is not a landlord in the traditional sense. Your landlord does not live with you. \n\nThey are renting a room in OP\u2019s home while OP is also still living inside the home with them. They do not have total control and access of the entire house. \n\nThey share the kitchen and living areas, which make them \u201clodgers\u201d and not tenants. The rights for lodgers and terms of eviction are vastly different than those of an actual tenant."]}
