But, you and future spouse need to make some very clear, solid lines and reinforce each other. You can't give your parents an inch, and they've just proven that to you.

I see that your mom even offered to pay for the extra guests. Although it was my wedding day, in my culture it is an important celebration for the parents also, and in my country parents do help pay like your mom was offering.
