We have a RV parked beside her house and we are using her electric to run power. We have all our meals with her, her husband and her kids and we also take showers indoors, as well as do laundry. It is helping us out drastically because we are able to save money for our home purchase (we couldn't save while we were in our rental). Now the agreement is that I do house chores (sweeping, mopping, dishes, caring for her dogs, their laundry if I feel like it and alternating cooking days), helping with grocery shopping (roughly $600 a month because we all eat together) and pay her $150 for the water and electric we are using. So around $750 a month, plus all her housework is done by me. All the yard work is done by my husband (mowing, weed whacking, insect spraying, garbage runs, and driveway maintenance- as it's dirt and gets ruts). I'm currently 26 weeks pregnant as well. Point being, we do A LOT. SIL, her husband and her kids hardly ever have to lift a finger with us being here.\n\nAnyways, I'm currently not working. My husband owns his own business and is gone 40-50hrs a week and makes more than enough to provide all we need to here, plus what we need PLUS saving a significant amount for a house. He doesn't want me working while pregnant (I have hypertension) so I left my job 3 months ago. Well, lately my SIL has been sending me job alert after job alert. Easily 8-10+ a day. She's been dropping hints constantly. Like every single time we go anywhere, she will be like \"these guys are hiring, I can grab you an app\". I always say no. There's no need for me to work right now, as I'm contributing well beyond my means already and my husband does not want me working right now. She drops it but then continues to send me the alerts. \n\nYesterday I was kind of fed up because SIL asked me to do a lot more yesterday and I was just exhausted. So I was cleaning, doing all their laundry and scrubbing walls because they have a party planned and she sends over an alert for a cleaning position and I lost it. I responded with \"okay, I will get a job but that means you will have no one to clean your dirty underwear and scrub your walls for you and I will not be doing anything but my portion of chores around here.\" She responded with \"I'm just trying to help. There's no fucking need to be nasty.\" My husband is on my side. AITA?\n\nETA: posted to another commenter: We have talked about it (I thought the same thing- her being fed up with our arrangement) but my SIL has made it clear that she wants us here and doesn't even want us to buy a house. To a point of her talking about converting her barn in to an apartment for us and making big plans for it without actually getting a \"yes\" from us. She says this is her way of \"helping\" (sending me the job alerts) because she feels that two people need a job because of how resentful she is of her own husband for not working.", "created_utc": 1684853254, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pqnx6/aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_stop_sending_me_job/", "score": 257, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand your frustation. In the end, you are right. If you get a job, she won't have anyone to clean up after her family. If she doesn't want you there, she should say it directly without being passive-agressive. To my understanding, you have a deal about living there and you are fullfilling it. She is obviously looking down on you. Hopefully you will move out soon.", "Like, she's being a bit of a dick, but ultimately you don't have to be living with her.

Oh, she has a lot of angry.", "NTA but it's time for your husband to step in and have a very clear, very direct conversation with her cause something is brewing here.\n\n1) Ask is she really really truly actually ok with you guys living there. While you're doing a ton for her it can be overwhelming having your personal space turned into family space. He needs to figure out exactly how ok she is now that you've been doing it for a while and set up monthly family meetings to review the plan. If they need to wind this agreement up, set a date to wind it up. They don't owe you a chance to save money.\n\n2) He needs to clarify that he's really really truly actually ok with you not working. Make sure she understands that you guys are on track to move out by your agreed on date without you working and that this is indeed his plan.\n\n3) Feel out if she has feelings about not being able to be a stay at home mom. There might be some jealousy mixed up here and it would explain why she's nagging at you.\n\nAnd then he needs to end with a blunt ask... \"If we're going to keep doing this trade until date X, I need you to stop needling wife about working and i need you to stop sending her job ideas. Can you do that?\" Then stop and let silence descend.", "NTA. Tell her that you DO NOT (make it very clear) want any job apps or alerts, nor are you going to be getting a job before the baby is born.

Tell her to either shut up and be happy with the help you're giving her for her house or you'll move and she won't have that anymore. In this situation you NEED to be very clear, concise, and to the point so she'll get it through her head.", "Sounds like SIL is getting tired, but she also agreed to this.

While her approach may come across as passive-aggressive, it's worth acknowledging that living together may be challenging for her as well.\r  \n\r  \nYou mentioned that you and your husband are trying to save money for a future home purchase, but the financial aspects you mentioned don't make sense - having a child and leaving employment can impact your financial stability massively.\r  \n\r  \nConsidering the apparent tensions, it might be worth exploring alternative housing options. This could involve searching for your own place that better suits your needs and allows for more independence. Moving out could alleviate the strain on your relationship with your sister-in-law and provide a fresh start for everyone involved.\r  \n\r  \n\rIn the end, it's crucial to prioritize your own well-being and happiness.

It *might* be one thing if you were staying there for free, but you are paying *and* providing significant help around the house, on top of being pregnant. I think you are more than justified in asking her to stop. \n\nI think, however, that when you move out, you should be prepared for her demands for gratitude for how she helped you during this time.", "NTA, the alerts would seem passive-aggressive.

But it also sounds like you and your husband have an arrangement you're both comfortable with, so your sister's efforts to help come off as judgmental instead of supportive.\n\nHonestly, though, if you're 26 weeks pregnant and have hypertension, you might be better off just finding a part-time desk job, or some remote work you can do from home, because either option is going to be less physically demanding than the manual labor you've been performing for your sister's entire household.", "ESH. You are insistent that you\u2019re contributing more than your fair share. She is passive aggressive and while she might be saying she wants you there, her actions clearly say otherwise. Honestly you\u2019re both exhausting and immature. It\u2019s her house, her property, her utilities. She clearly wants you gone. Stop pretending you don\u2019t get it, and for the love of god, stop whining. Have some self respect and move, already.", "Okay... why can't some people just communicate? Seriously? Your SIL could have just said to both of you \"well, this was a good time, but give me my room back\" and you could have said after a few days \"you know, I could go back to work but that means you would have to go back to doing your own chores\". \n\nESH for not communicating properly.", "NTA... You are working! A job outside the home might be less taxing then all the work you are doing at home. Please keep a daily journal of chores and hours. Put limits on how many hours you contribute per week. This way if you work extra when you have the energy, you can take a day off when you need to without feeling (or being made to feel) indebted. \n\nMy husband and I did a property maintenance caretaker thing like this.

I think her resentment of her own husband is causing her to not listen to my husband and his wants surrounding that issue.\n\nShe was actually a SAHM for the past 12 years. She hadn't had a job since she was a teenager. So she has no qualms about being a SAHM but then again, she now has the resentment of her husband and due to that, she is pretty iffy surrounding the work issue.

I think that my SIL and her resentment of him is definitely bleeding out in to how she treats me and my husband because my husband is literally the opposite. If he sees me sitting down even remotely close to dinner, he immediately starts cooking and asking me if I need anything and will dote on me constantly and I do the same for him.

So, prior to us moving here (2 months ago) we were paying $2800 for a 2 bedroom with nothing included and that is considered a \"good deal\" for our state.

It helps too that work has picked up now that the warm weather is here. We only need maybe $20k saved for the down payment on a property so it won't be too much longer that we are here.

I actually am rarely on Reddit so I am completely unaware of most of the subreddits available. Thank you sooo much!! \n\nAnd right? Well, I think the problem is that she's never actually been pregnant. Her daughters are actually her biological neices.

Let her know you appreciate her efforts and thoughtfulness, and then just tell her you'll save the alerts and check them again post-birth and recovery to see if there's a company you* like. \n\nI would apologize for the comment, personally, and take this as an opportunity to talk with her about future plans and goals for jobs you're interested in pursuing after managing the baby setup. It really does sound like she's just projecting but with good intentions, so this might just be a misunderstanding that can be overcome through open communication and some leniency. Set expectations with one another and tell her you need her support and understanding while you and your husband are setting up your life goals.", "Yeah, your SIL is trying to get rid of you, but doesn\u2019t want to be blamed for getting rid of you, so she\u2019s doing things to get you to leave on your own accord. When she denies this, she\u2019s lying to your face. Again, she doesn\u2019t want to be blamed.", "NTA, but it sounds like the job alerts are just a symptom. I think you guys need to get out - the situation sounds toxic.", "OP\u2019s health is much more important than the income she was bringing in. They\u2019ve already lost a pregnancy and this rainbow baby is beyond precious cargo.", "They most certainly are not staying for free. They\u2019re paying for water and electric as well as buying food at almost triple their normal budget.", "NTA. And time to tell the SiL to start sending those job alerts to the husband", "Because lives in help would cost more than you do, and would expect paid vacations. Run!!!", "[deleted]", "You guys need to move. Even if it's to a famcamp situation that has hookups. What does she expect to happen when you give birth? This situation is going to get worse. I'm not even talking about the job alerts. This isn't healthy. You guys need to get out of there.", "I am just curious: How do they support themselves? \n\nNot that it matters, you are clearly NTA", "You all need to find somewhere else. I'm sorry but your SIL is angry about her husband and taking it out on you. You already pay for a good chunk of their food, do most/all of their chores, pay your utilities, etc...this is ridiculous.", "I don't think you are the AH, but you have options and you need to live with whatever you and your husband choose.\n\n1. Get a job, save more money for your down payment and get out faster. You can always quit once you have your down payment. If you work, you can hopefully have your own home before the baby comes????\n\n2. Don't work, stay for the next 6+ months (per your timeline of how much you need to save and your savings rate currently) dealing with this. It won't get better, you will all be resentful of each other. \n   Your SIL will be resentful, because she is working and giving you and your husband a good deal to save for your down payment and you are not working. (I don't care if she is right or wrong to be resentful, it is what it is if you choose to stay there)\n   Your SIL's husband will be resentful because he is misogynistic and will expect you to cater to him and you won't/don't want to.\n   You will be resentful because you don't want to wait on them to this extent while you are not working.\n\nAlso, once you have your baby, how the hell will you live in the RV??? Your timeline is cutting it close, it can take months to buy a property even if you have all your money saved.", "I thought the chores were essentially payment for lot rent/water ect? OP doesn't pay anything to stay there beyond electricity and some groceries (that she and her husband also eat).", "How much do you wanna bet SIL wants OP to get a job so she can milk more rent out of them AND would expect OP to continue doing all the chores she is currently doing? NTA and yeah move out. The SIL wants a house Elf THAT ALSO pays for the privilege.  Also, this much manual labor is not a good idea if you are having complications in your pregnancy", "OP's husband works. there are plenty of 1 income households out there and OP even specifies that her husband's income is enough to cover their expenses & savings", "They aren't homeless. They're living in an RV to save up to buy a home. They could afford an apartment, based on OP's description of their finances. It's also weird to phrase it as \"planning for a baby\" when they're already well into the pregnancy. It's not like they're destitute and actively trying to get pregnant.", "> This situation is going to get worse. I'm not even talking about the job alerts.\n\nYeah, this whole situation is a powder keg", "There are thousands of full-time RV families. It\u2019s not as primal as you think.", "I meant to put a monetary value on the housework that OP does using market rates that SIL must think is fair, because she sent that job posting. The housework is part of the 'rent', it's just not paid in cash. Her husband is already paying cash for utilities and groceries, a total of $750/month.", "[deleted]", "NTA. And I\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say that if he has misogynistic views, his \u201cdiscrimination\u201d is probably from saying things he shouldn\u2019t be to women at work. Or, and this is just a stab in the dark, he has other troublesome views which he can\u2019t really get away with expressing in a work environment (against minorities, LGTBQ+, religion etc) and he feels like the victim when he\u2019s not tolerated/backed up in his behaviors.", "He is being discriminated against for being lazy.  Of his wife will support him not working, why should he work?  All his needs are taken care of.", "She doesn't want you there but she wants your labor. I think she's an asshole in general for letting her kids watch her husband act like that.", "Her husband is paying for the utilities they're using and the food they're eating, buy OP is \"paying\" the actual rent in the form of chores. That's why she's still doing the chores while she's pregnant, and SIL's husband isn't.", "how are they homeless? they live in an RV and pay rent (in money and labor) to SIL. do you think all people that live in RVs are homeless? because if so we have very different definitions of \"homeless\"", "Right so SIL is getting that value in trade, instead of money. The commenter is saying to show her \"this is the monetary equivalent of my work\"", "They're living in a camper, don't have the means to shower or do laundry or a fixed address? I guess it depends on your definition (is someone living in their car or a tent because they have nowhere else to go homeless? Or is the car/tent their home?).", "Sometimes, it feels like common sense is just a book on library shelves next to The Federalist Papers and The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nYour SIL is clearly not thinking rationally on this topic. You have at most ~14 weeks before you'd have to go out on maternity leave anyway, even if you were hired somewhere today. Thats barely over 3 months. And, with your hypertension, that presumes you don't end up on bedrest before that.\n\nAnd this doesn't even get into the question of whether you and your husband want you returning to work any time in the near future, once your baby is born. Which is a decision that is solely between the two of you.\n\nThere is are multiple good reasons to wait until you're ready to go back to work full time.\n\nEspecially with your comments, your SILs projection of her own marital issues onto you is very obvious.\n\nI would suggest quietly expanding your search for other housing alternatives. Maybe start looking for someone else who would be willing to host you the way SIL & BIL are now.\n\nOnce you've found a viable option or two, if you still want to stay where you are, it would be far easier for your husband to tell his sister that the topic of you & work is closed. That if it comes up again y'all will be moving in short order.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"for telling my SIL to stop sending me job alerts?\" .. The right time to tell her that is when you move your RV away from her property.", "Sounds like YTA and not getting the hint. \n\n\nYou don't send job alerts to an unemployed person unless you are trying to get them to go out and get a job so you do not have to take care of them any longer.\n\n\nLiving in a camper on someone else's property is a prime example of that.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I read your edit and it sounds like she is just to timid to tell you what she really thinks. She wants you to move out and be on your own. But she is no nice to force the issue.", "YTA for living like that, what the hell even. yes get a job and move to an actual place.", "NTA. Regardless of her motivation, you guys need to GTFO there. No amount of money saved is worth the headache known as your SIL.", "NTA  \n\n\nI mean....I know there are laws, but who would seriously hire and train a pregnant woman? That seems really counter intuitive. She also seems to be projecting her opinions/marriage on you.   \n\n\nYou are an adult and need your own space.   \nGet the house and move.", " NTA - tell her to send those job openings to her husband. How do you see this working once your give birth? It looks to me like a slow moving disaster. Move your asses (and RV) to a situation that will work for you once you have your baby.", "NTA, time to move.  I haven't priced RV spots lately but I'm sure you can find an affordable hookup. She's disrespectful and taking advantage of you. Tell her to back off or else type moving, then follow through. This arrangement has run its course.", "NTA sounds like she has a sweet thing going, you have any idea what a (legal) domestic service doing Al that you do would cost them? Holy heck\u2019s they should be paying you not you paying them anything.", "NTA but it'd be just as cheap to rent a spot at a rv camp for a month it would probably cost less honestly", "Its time to move.", "NTA. She's sending job alerts to the wrong person and trying to interfere with decisions you and your husband made.\n\nI would get put of there asap; she wants a housekeeper and gardener because her lazy husband.", "wait, SIL's hubby doesnt work??  \ud83e\udd14", "Actually, yeah, she\u2019s probably fed up with husband and instead of showing him job ads, which she knows would be pointless, she has to show them to someone and you\u2019re the only other person who doesn\u2019t have a \u201cjob\u201d. Of course you DO have a job but not a \u201cpaid job outside of the home\u201d. She must be going stir crazy.", "NTA. Oh my word, does she expect you to start a new job just before you give birth??? What a weird SIL!", "I think SIL thinks of OP as a live in maid and a charity case she can take advantage of at the same time. Truly odd mentality but people are weird", "It might be one thing if you were staying there for free, but you are paying and providing significant help around the house, on top of being pregnant.", "Of course she wants you to stay\u2026you\u2019re doing all the work. She\u2019s treating you like a slave, knowing you\u2019re pregnant with an extra medical condition that can be life threatening. You and husband need to move immediately. Find a campground where you can stay, you need to get out of there.", "She's projecting her resentment for her husband onto you.\n\nShe also wants you to stay as \"the help\" because her husband won't lift a finger.", "She is aware you\u2019re pregnant, right? I mean does she expect you to be working whilst giving birth and then simply put your baby to one side and carry on with your shift whilst the manager cuts the umbilical cord?", "SIL should send the job alerts to her non-working husband.", "And why he isnt cleaning then?", "Ah ok. She wants to ensure there\u2019s a steady stream of money coming in. Of course she doesn\u2019t want you to move. Things are just peachy as they are. I would get out of there as soon as you possibly can.", "Yeah this is all about them and their messed up dynamic.  Save as much as you can right now, but start REALLY looking to move.", "LOL. \n\nPrecious cargo or not, OP cannot say her and her husband are trying to save money when she quit her job and having a baby. \n\nAnd I find interesting how she cannot keep her job, but It's okay for her to be her SIL's maid...", "OP said in [a different comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13pqnx6/comment/jlaufom/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that SIL went back to work.\n\n>Yeah he hasn't actually worked in years. Which, up until 2 years ago, neither was she. She was a SAHM for 12 years but when David decided to quit his job and job searching completely, she ended up going to work. He will get a job and quit by the 2nd shift in, claiming people were discriminating against him but that's truly not the case. He would just rather sit home and play his video games and have women dote on him because he is misogynistic and won't step foot in the kitchen.\n\nOP and hubs need to get out ASAP.", "LOL - is it really discrimination when you don't tolerate people's intolerance?", "Take SIL and her kids with. She wouldn't have many issues if her own husband were actually being there.", "I would say the chores + $750 / month is a fair deal, especially with how much groceries are now.  For 2 people you can easily spend $1000+ /month.  SIL is also providing a safe place to park their RV.", "OpS Husband is doing the yard work though", "As a family of 2, who is eating $600 a month?"]}
