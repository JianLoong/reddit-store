I was literally watching the video and he was sitting right next to me when I asked. I was simply just shocked by his response bc he CHOSE me to be his wife. I just didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be last on the list, but I can understand his thought process as well.

His mom was genuinely mortified by my husband\u2019s response and told him about himself even tho I told her not to bc it\u2019s such a small thing. (I called her to tell her lol) \n\nEdit- I do still believe I am not the ah here. yes, it was a silly question to ask, but I didn\u2019t even think about it. I had a right to be hurt. I didn\u2019t and don\u2019t have a right to hold it against him tho. I am over it.

Are you feeling deprioritized in the relationship or that he's comparing you unfavorably to his Mum or something? Or did you just see the video and think \"that's funny, I'll try it.\" \n\nI think the fact you did it based on a video is what people are reacting to - that seems immature. However, I think it would be a valuable thing to assess...ideally before getting married.\n\nLonger: I can also imagine this being a pretty serious question in the context of family therapy if one has genuine concerns. Like if a relationship was not going well and someone wanted to know, point blank, how do you value me? And the answer is lower than the partner's parents, it does sort of suggest some problematic things. Maybe everyone here is just immature. As I said, I would really hope that's a question one asks before getting married. Personally, it would be a deal breaker for me if my spouse was still emotionally wedded to his family or origin before our partnership, or at least it would be a sign that I should build parts of my own life apart from that partner. It disgusted me as a kid when my Dad heaped praise on his Mom, but not my Mom, his wife. I remember being pretty sad at times imagining my Mom never got to experience someone who truly loved her romantically because he was still infatuated with his mom. I saw it as a rejection of our family, even though it was subtle and did not happen frequently.  In general, it's very important for children's mental health that parents reflect a united front (as long as they're not united in abuse or something). If parents are not a united front, it is too common for one of them (or both) to \"triangulate\" (Bowen) the child into their conflict, sometimes going as far as to unconsciously treat the child as their partner, relying on them for emotional support against the other adult partner. If he's putting his Mom first, I'd be really interested where his Dad is in the equation.\n\nI'm not doing the Reddit \"divorce him!\" thing, but you have the information now so you need to process it and try to understand what it means to him in practice. Does it mean he'll take her side in disputes to keep her close? Does it mean he sees you as an addendum to his family or origin, not as a family of your own? Does it just mean he's still pretty emotionally attached to his Mom? Does he expect you will make him your priority (after your kid) or are you supposed to prioritize your family or origin, or maybe friends, education, career, etc. above him? I'd want to know more. Maybe he's just a momma's boy and it's not a big deal in the relationship, but I'd still have a subsequent convo to let him know it hurt you to hear that more than you thought it would, and you wonder what it means.", "ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
