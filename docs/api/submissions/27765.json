She thought I was joking and started laughing. I said no seriously, and she raised an eyebrow and said \"what is this, the 70s?\".\n\nBasically, I said that as a kid I really liked having a gift giving holiday around december, as it helped me feel like I was fitting in with the christian kids. She said that we would obviously just do our gifting on other \"real\" holidays. But I think there is real value to fitting in, especially since we live in a very christian area, Muslim kids can feel lonely. She said our kid would only feel that way if they were a wimp. Kwanzaa isn't a real holiday, and we don't need to engage in weird made up holidays when we have real ones we celebrate.\n\nI was hurt by this, as I remember feeling lonely as a kid, and I remember Kwanzaa giving me similar experiances to other kids really helping, so I told her that. She said that if my familly hadn't done it I would have learned to deal with it like she did, and that we wouldn't want to coddle any kids we had. she said \"you need to be tough on kids, help them too much and they grow up weak\". I said that I was feeling kind of insulted, as she was literally insulting something that was important to me as a kid, and she told me to \"get over it\".\n\nAt this point I said \"You gotta raise kids right, and that is by  letting them know they are taken care of. Celebrating Kwanzaa is one small thing that could help them feel safe and like a part of their community.

I then had to take a couple day trip out of the state for work. Her sister today texted me they had been talking, and that they both thought I was an asshole for not budging on such a small point since it isn't a real holiday, and I clearly don't care about it since I don't currently celebrate it. It is too small a point to not have kids over.\n\nSo yeah, now they both think I am being a stubborn jerk for sticking with a holiday that doesn't matter, especially since I haven't celebrated it since I was 15. but I am not budging, because I think the holiday isn't really even the point as much as \"you got to be nice to kids\" and I am not budging on this no matter what anyone says.\n\nAita for sticking with this point?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For the record in case people don't know, kwanzaa is not a religious holiday.

As a Christian I can tell you Christmas is a holiday for gifts and pretty decorations. Trying to claim kwanza is something special and not Christian is silly to me bc christmas is the exact same. We put the meaning behind it that we want.", "Honestly if I said that she would probably answer yes.", "In some cultures gift giving is done on New Years rather than Christmas. Since that\u2019s a \u201creal\u201d holiday, and also at the same time of year as when most kids get gifts, maybe you can do this as a compromise?\n\nAnd then kid\u2019ll get bonus gifts on Eid I guess?\n\nHow strictly you raise children is a different issue. But it\u2019s also easy to say \u201cyou have to be hard on them\u201d when you don\u2019t have kids. A lot of parents end up spoiling theirs once they have them despite that.", "It\u2019s an occasion to give gifts to his kids. The opposite of a gift grab.", "For all the reasons he said. He sees it as a family tradition that is beneficial to any child they have. But not one he feels adults need to celebrate. \nDo you celebrate Halloween, also a religious holiday as an adult? Would you want to take any or do you take your children out on it?", "Why shouldn't Black people make up a new holiday, when their ancestors were stripped of their religion and forced to assimilate into Christianity?", "Damn, that's brutal. There's a difference between weakness and compassion. Based on this post I'd say you fall with the latter. If you were weak, you would've agreed with whatever she said instead of speaking your mind and holding your ground.", "Someone who would say that about you... is that someone you want to spend your life with and raise children with? Even ignoring the issue of future children, what does it mean for *you* that your partner would say that about you?", "Hell yeah I celebrated Halloween as an adult without kids!!! That\u2019s my most favoritist holiday ever!!! Yes. When I was single I still put up a Christmas tree. Yes. When I was single I still put out Easter decorations. Yes. When I was single I still decorated for the 4th of July and sometimes got sparklers bc pretty!!! But Halloween was totally celebrated the most!"]}
