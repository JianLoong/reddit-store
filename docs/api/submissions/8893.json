I quit while in the midst of moving my mother-in-law, it rained overnight and ruined everything I had left outside.", "selftext": "Backstory, my MIL lived four hours from our city. Last year she decided to sell her house and move near the family. She recently closed on another house here as her house was under contract. My wife stayed home, overseeing some work being done on the new house while also painting. Myself and our daughter (6) went down to my MIL\u2019s house to get her moved out. \n\nMy MIL is the type lady that exalts males on a glorified pedestal. Over the years, she has made numerous inappropriate remarks about my body build or my appearance. She has even gone as far as asking very personal questions. Nonetheless, her mouth has gotten her in major trouble. With that said, when we arrived she seemed to have been minding her manners at first. She made a comment to my daughter along the lines of when she gets older, she should marry a man just like her father. \n\nLater that night we had an argument. My kid did not eat dinner because she had a stomach ache. My MIL demanded she help clean the kitchen and said I should be relaxing instead. My argument was, why should she have to help clean up from dinner when she didn\u2019t even eat? The next morning, my daughter slept in a bit which irritated my MIL. She made a comment that my wife is lazy and that\u2019s where her granddaughter gets it from. It pissed me off considering all the work my wife had been doing to her new house. An hour later, my daughter got out of bed. I was outside when my MIL was putting socks on my kid and said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever get fat like your mother.\u201d I didn\u2019t know about that comment until next day. \n\nAs they were packing boxes, I overheard my MIL telling my daughter that her mother tried aborting her. For the record, that is not true. It was my MIL that was hounding my wife to abort the pregnancy because she said my wife would \u2018blow up even bigger\u2019 and that having kids ruin lives. All my daughter knew about abortion was that it meant a mother does not want/cannot have the baby. \n\nMy child was upset and hurt. My instinct was to get her away from that environment. We got lunch and I took her to the beach to distract her mind. We spoke it over, I promised her what her grandmother had said was not true. I called my wife, she and our child spoke for awhile. It was while they were on the phone the comment about not getting fat like your mother was brought to my attention. \n\nWe went back to the house, I gathered our belongings and we left. Outside sat several pieces of furniture and a few large boxes. My MIL tried hiring movers after we left, but none were available. Overnight it rained which ruined everything. My BIL called me a POS for letting her furniture get ruined, also claimed it was elder abuse. Week later I received a handwritten bill requesting $4,000 for the ruined furniture. My MIL wrote how saddened she was to realize my wife had brainwashed and demasculinized me. The move occurred at the first of the year, yesterday I received an additional handwritten letter stating I will be sued if I do not pay for the damages.", "created_utc": 1675286447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r6jpj/aita_i_quit_while_in_the_midst_of_moving_my/", "score": 1089, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She made numerous inappropriate comments to my daughter which ultimately caused her to become distraught. The final straw is when my MIL lied and said my child\u2019s mother tried aborting her. I removed my child and learned something else that had been said. I left and went back home right in the midst of the move. I left several pieces of furniture and boxes outside. My MIL was physically unable to move the furniture, she also could not find anyone to help that day. Overnight, the furniture was rained on which ruined everything. My actions of up and leaving caused a lot of continued issues.
