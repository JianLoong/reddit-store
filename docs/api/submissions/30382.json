My(29F) husband(29M) died in a work accident earlier this year. A colleague of his (let\u2019s call her Mel, 27F) rallied and stood by my side from the moment I was informed of his disappearance and eventual demise. We became fast friends.\n\nFast forward a few months later, we encouraged Mel to date my brother (we\u2019ll call him John, 29M) and they\u2019ve been on the love speed train ever since. Two weeks ago, they announced that they will be getting engaged on the first anniversary of my husband\u2019s death, as it is also Mel\u2019s birthday.\n\nThey asked me after if I would be okay with it, but the announcement and question caught me offguard and I told them \u201cI don\u2019t know how to feel about it right now, but if you\u2019re adamant then I can\u2019t really stop you I guess. However, I will not be attending as it will most likely be a tough day for me.\u201d I really do want to celebrate their engagement, but I\u2019m pretty sure my feelings are going to be very raw on that day and I wouldn\u2019t have it in me to even put on a fake smile. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve had some time to think and relay to the rest of our friend group, they are appalled and think that Mel and John deciding to get engaged on that particular day is tone deaf, and especially so on the first anniversary of my husband\u2019s death, given that they both knew him, and my brother was very close to him. My friends and siblings have all said they will not be celebrating the engagement. My husband was extremely well loved and his is a massive loss to alot of people.\n\nI agree with them that it is tone deaf, and frankly am quite hurt that my brother doesn\u2019t even care that I will not be attending his engagement or celebrating it. We are the same age, months apart, but we might as well be twins attached at the hip. If the roles were reversed, I would not even consider the date out of respect. My friends and the rest of my siblings think that I\u2019m under reacting to the situation.\n\nWIBTA if I put my foot down and told them not to get engaged on that day? I certainly do not want my husband\u2019s death to hang over everyone\u2019s head like a dark cloud forever, but is it unreasonable to ask for the first anniversary to be reserved for mourning him?", "created_utc": 1699190776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17obwum/wibta_if_i_tell_my_brother_not_to_get_engaged_on/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Couples decided together in advance a date to \u201cget engaged\u201d? This is a thing? That\u2019s so weird to me. I mean, to me, being engaged is when a couple agrees to marry. Have they not already agreed to marry if they have picked an engagement date? So really, they already ARE engaged right? So on the planned date, is this an engagement party? Or were they planning to stage a proposal?\n\nI am truly confused by what they are doing.", "Info- I see it's also Mel's birthday, how do you feel about her celebrating that day? They should probably move the engagement date but it just feels like a mess in general because she can't exactly change her own birthday.", "What? If your husband died this year, the engagement date is still months away? And the two of then publicly announced this on social media? How does engagement work these days?!?!", "NTA\n\nThey've been dating less than a year.  If her birthday is such an important date I don't see why they can't wait until next year, or are they planning on the wedding taking place then?", "NAH.  I lost my Mom to cancer and  twins shortly after birth (in the same year), so I understand that first year need to grieve.  But what helped me was \"doing well by doing good.\"  I gave back on those first anniversaries, and it helped me cope that day.  Is there a way you could give back that would honor your husband that day?\n\nYou might also consider what your husband would have wanted.  Would he have wanted this dear coworker who stood by you in your time of need and his BIL to be getting engaged?  Perhaps he would've found that the best way to spend your day.\n\nI choose to think of my Mom and my twins on their birthdays because those were joyful, loving days.  Maybe he would want such a horrible date in your memory to be turned for good.  \n\nI can't tell you how to feel -- no one can.  But maybe this will give you something to consider.  I pray for peace for you!", "NAH. They likely see your late husband as a wonderful person who brought them together. This may be their way of honouring him? I don't think there's anything wrong with letting them know that you've had time to reflect and that you simply aren't ok with the start of their marriage being on the anniversary of the day you lost your husband. They may still go ahead with it, but it's good to have your feelings known. \n\nWhen I got married the date we had chosen turned out to be the same as my friend's anniversary with her husband. In between setting the date and the actual wedding, my friend's husband died unexpectedly. We had already planned everything for that date, but we still offered to move it because we didn't want her to suffer needlessly. She asked us to keep the date as it felt like a way to honour him and their own marriage. She thanked us for keeping the date afterwards, she enjoyed seeing us as they once were. But it was important to me that our joyous day didn't hurt someone.", "ESH. You said:\n\nThey asked me after if I would be okay with it, but the announcement and question caught me offguard and I told them \u201cI don\u2019t know how to feel about it right now, but if you\u2019re adamant then I can\u2019t really stop you I guess. However, I will not be attending as it will most likely be a tough day for me.\u201d\n\nSo you were fine, to his point.  \n\nAnd then you said:\n\nNow that I\u2019ve had some time to think and relay to the rest of our friend group, they are appalled and think that Mel and John deciding to get engaged on that particular day is tone deaf, and especially so on the first anniversary of my husband\u2019s death, given that they both knew him, and my brother was very close to him. My friends and siblings have all said they will not be celebrating the engagement. My husband was extremely well loved and his is a massive loss to alot of people.\n\nThis makes you an AH.  Combined with them being completely tone deaf, you all\nSuck.  And absolutely need to work on you empathy and communication.  As another posted noted, what are you going to do, No celebrate Mel\u2019s birthday ever?", "I think this is probably ESH tbh\n\nIt was a bit tone deaf on their part to even want to use that date, given that your brother and your husband were close, and your brothers (soon to be) fiancee was your husband's coworker\n\nYour husband died in a work accident, which, given that Mel worked with your husband, and still wants to use the one year anniversary of his death for the date to celebrate her engagement, is... icky\n\nI understand it's also her birthday;  that people want to make new memories, more positive memories\n\nBut seriously \n\nThe one year anniversary \n\nThat's just... icky to me\n\nI understand you needed time to process the request to use that date, but once you had, you should have gone back to them and said \"hey, I've thought about it, I'm really not comfortable with this\" rather than involving so many other people \n\nI definitely think its E S H", "Mel\u2019s birthday makes sense as a day they picked. One life ends and another begins. In this case a new life together going forward with Mel and your brother. They aren\u2019t being disrespectful of your husband or you. They even talked it over with you. Not saying your grief is wrong. By the time the day comes you might be feeling differently. Sweet your brother sees Mel\u2019s birthday as a means to celebrate her. Yes, bittersweet for you considering you approve of their relationship. One might wonder if your dearly departed would find it offensive or delighted. It seems his demise brought Mel into the fold. As she was very supportive of you. Can you not be supportive of her truly with this?", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry to be blunt but that\u2019s not just the day of your husband\u2019s death. That\u2019s Mel\u2019s birthday. So are you all never going to celebrate her birthday cause it\u2019s your husbands death day too?", "YTA - They asked you. You said \"let me think\". Instead of thinking, you went and told a bunch of people. You haven't even said \"no\" and people are accusing them of dishonoring your husband and you. (Had you even considered that they wanted to get engaged on that date to honor him and your love for each other?)\n\nYou should have told them \"no\" rather than spread ill will about them when all they have done is ask your permission and give you time to decide.", "Ywbta I'm sorry for your loss but you have no authority to \"put your foot down\" about anything. It is also Mel's birthday so it's understandable to use that as a date, and maybe getting engaged that day helps them process your husband's death.", "I don\u2019t know how to feel about this, but I am very sorry for your loss.\n\nOn one hand, I realize how incredibly difficult it would be for you to celebrate on this day or to associate it with anything other than tragedy.\nI think they can easily pick another date, especially since your grief is so fresh. \n\nHowever, if you think Mel should not celebrate her birthday on the actual date going forward, that\u2019s unfair. How long would it take for that date to become more about her than your husband? I think that\u2019s impossible to answer right now, but something to consider. Your will grieve for your husband every day and there will be other days like his birthday or your anniversary that will be especially hard. Are those dates embargoed too? Just something to consider.", "So is Mel not allowed to celebrate her birthday either? It\u2019s sad that people are going to boycott their engagement because it\u2019s the date that your husband passed away. They picked that date because it\u2019s her birthday. How long do you want them to wait for to get engaged? Wouldn\u2019t your husband want them to be happy? I can understand your choosing not to participate but you making their engagement about you is weird.", "Why do people need to announce their engagement day in advance? Can't they just get engaged now if they already decided to do so? So much attention seeking behavior around weddings makes me crazy.", "Nta- however i don't think putting your foot down will do anything helpful. Your bro is working hard to be as tone deaf as he can. What you told him originally still stands, you wont attend. On top of that you wont help him turn a horrible day of your life into partytime for him. I would drop the rope. Breath. Let your other sibs and family deal with him being an AH \n\nBig hugs\nDeepest condolences", "It was N A H until you told a bunch of people and stirred up drama. You could have thought it over and then gone back to them with your feelings. Instead you let a crowd stir you up. YTA. You are not the main character in everyone else\u2019s story.", "ESH, Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nIf they're planning some kind of event on that day, just decline the invitation and move on. You don't get to \"put your foot down\" about anything here.\n\nI don't even get why their engagement day is \"planned\" or why they would announce that in advance at all.  Why is engagement now a group event?\n\nAn engagement party usually takes place *after* engagement so the families can come together, etc.  It's not a party where you actually \"propose.\"", "You need to speak to your brother and Mel and ask them to choose another day. I remember the first anniversary of my husband's death it hurt unbearably. I don't believe they're doing it maliciously, but they should have realised that it would hurt you deeply.", "I\u2019m so sorry but YTA", "NTA\n\nJohn and Mel sprung a pretty inconsiderate question and you reacted as best you could. Then you thought about it more, asked others for their opinions because you don't want to make the would wrong decision, and they reacted. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong about you approaching others for help and instead you did it out of frustrated confusion, but I don't think they would look at it any differently if the date came, everyone is at Mary's birthday party, but supporting you at the same time, and Surprise! We're engaged! Then they'd react, confused like you did to the question, stew on it, and come to the same conclusion.\n\nEither way, you are completely justified and they really need to actually think about what they're doing, not only to you, but to you and your husband's friends and family.\n\nEdit: I didn't see your reply to the other commenter about them telling others before you. You're even more not the AH. They didn't even have the tact to talk to you first.", "**YTA** \\- Life is for the living.  Your husband's death does not trump Mel's birthday.  Embrace their happiness.  Allow something wonderful to brighten your day of gloom.", "YWBTA if you tell them what they can or can\u2019t do.\n\nYou get to choose for yourself how you mourn not other people. You can bow out of a party that day. You can schedule a memorial service or do something private. I think you were wrong to tell your whole friend group and drag other people into it.\n\nMaybe there is a reason they want to celebrate their engagement that day. Sometimes it can be hard to accommodate everyone when picking a date for an event because of work schedules, venue availability, family schedules. This is her birthday as well. Would holding the celebration a week after make your loss less? If they have been so supportive of you for a year and asked you about your feelings then maybe don\u2019t paint them as tone death. Maybe they understand that you don\u2019t feel up to coming and you can understand that this doesn\u2019t mean your husband wasn\u2019t important to them.", "YWBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Her Birthday\" trupls your date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"WIBTA if I put my foot down and told them not to get engaged on that day?\" .. do you want them to laugh in your face?

As you said, your hubs passed on Mel's bday, and she was there for you from the moment you found out, which I think was the same day he passed?

Most of the comments fail to acknowledge the most important aspect of this: everyone grieves differently. It's understandable that you are protective of the first anniversary of your husband's death, and I am so sorry that you're going through this. You have every right to feel how you feel. But here's the thing: That calendar day is also important to them, as Mel's birthday. You can't dismiss that part, and put a lock on a calendar day. Further, those people were also close to your husband, and don't necessarily grieve the same way you do. For them, perhaps choosing the first anniversary of his death, as also their engagement date, is their way of turning a negative time into a positive time. I don't think they have any malicious intent. It seems that their way of grieving is therapeutic, and it's their way of honoring him.
