About a week before the event, Jack and Hannah asked if they could take their wedding pictures as well after our ceremony and during the reception. I asked if they meant when everything was over but they clarified that they wanted people in the pictures.\n\nThe reason for their request was that they eloped, so they didn\u2019t get to have the whole wedding experience and they wanted the pictures to show their future kids and hang on their future home.\n\nI can understand why they would want that, so I told them that they could take pictures but either before the events or after the guests had left. That\u2019s because they planned to come dressed in wedding attire and I didn\u2019t want them to be wearing that during the wedding.\n\nThey tried to convince me to change my mind but I stood my ground with when they could take the pictures and they ended up saying that they didn\u2019t want to take them anymore. I thought nothing of it and just carried on with my life.\n\nUntil, the day of the wedding they arrived with a photographer and Hannah was wearing a long white dress. The guests had already arrived, so I told my MOH to please tell them to change clothes. Hannah and Jack refused so the groomsmen kicked them out.\n\nAfter the wedding, my mother asked where they were and I told her. She agreed that they shouldn\u2019t have done it but that I could have let it slide since they were already here. She also said that everyone who attended the wedding knew who the couple was, so it\u2019s not like they would\u2019ve caused any confusion.\n\nI\u2018m beginning to feel bad because they just wanted to have nice memories and pictures to show in the future and I ruined it for them. My husband and MOH say that I did nothing wrong but I feel like they\u2019re biased.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n AITA?

Maybe they were too young and immature to get married if they can't understand how rude that was.", "NTA - I mostly just lurk on Reddit and I have never commented in this sub, but as a newlywed this one got me. You were much more gracious than many people would be to even allow them to do photos like that on YOUR wedding day.", "Don\u2019t feel bad. If they\u2019d wanted those photos and memories so much, they should\u2019ve had a wedding instead of eloping. NTA", "I'm confused as to why they would want to pass off someone else's memories as their own to their future children.   NTA", "NTA.  This is one of the craziest stories I have EVER heard.  Your sister came to your wedding dressed as a bride, bringing her own photographer so your guests could be in her photos?  And this is because you held a gun to her head and forced her and her husband to elope?  And your mother thinks you should have accepted that because they were already THERE?  Unbelievable. Tell your sister this:  \"First you make your choices and then your choices make you.\"  (sorry about the gun to the head thing but it is so bizarre that your sister thinks her lack of photos has anything to do with you.)", "NTA. They were trying to get a free wedding through yours. Free reception, all the family without the cost.  Not cool especially when you said no. Than they tried to force it.\n\nThat shows they have NO RESPECT for you or your feelings. They tried to make it about them. Good on you for kicking them out. Now they know what boundaries are... hopefully.  \n\nIf they're angry i would turn it around on them. Ask them what you ever did to them? Why would they do something so hateful and disrespectful on YOUR SPECIAL DAY?  You'd never try to hurt them the way they hurt you. They should start back peddling really fast and apologize if they have a brain in their head.\n\nEither way, it was a manipulative narcissistic move. Who cares if you have anything to do with them after this.", "So they wanted nice memories for the future...but what would they be memories of exactly? Hang a picture on the wall and say...what? What stories are they going to tell the kids when they go through the \"wedding album\" in years to come? \"Oh this was the time we, already married, dressed up in wedding attire to take pictures at somebody else's wedding\"? It's not as though any pictures they would have taken would have any connection to any significant event of theirs. Pictures for pictures sake, so where is the memory or meaning? I'm so confused!\n\nIn any case, they were not entitled to use your wedding and reception, which actually is a significant and memorable event for you, as props in their pictures. To claim your event as their own so they can create false memories for the future or whatever is straight bananas, and that they attempted to do it after you had already told them know just emphasizes their sense of entitlement. You did NOT owe them that.\n\nCongratulations on your marriage!!\n\nNTA", "NTA.  They can hire a photographer if it's that important.", "NTA if you choose to elope you are actively saying you are ok with not having everything you get with big weddings. If they are now regretting that, they can plan a vow renewal with everyone there. Trying to steal from your big day is just wrong, your wedding is about you and your spouse. This is right up there with people who propose at other peoples weddings.", "[deleted]", "OP, were these people also going to pay for part of your wedding? Because THEY chose a cheap option, which was to elope. But then they wanted to use your venue, decorations, and guests to take wedding photos? Uh, no. They can PAY for all of those things if they are important to them.", "Thanks for your words, I\u2019m just feeling a bit guilty. I hope we\u2019re able to fix things in the future.", "Exactly. SHE SHOWED UP TO YOUR WEDDING DAY IN A WEDDING DRESS!? What is your mother thinking enabling them and making excuses for them? I\u2019m so sorry op. Call her out!!", "Exactly! They eloped. And one of the consequences is you don\u2019t get a nice party with guests\u2026 \n\nOP, you were so generous. You gave them a finger and they took your whole hand. That is just rude. \n\nAnd congratulations on your marriage.", "Exactly!! A major reason many people choose to elope is to avoid the cost of paying for a big wedding, which is fair enough but they don\u2019t get to piggyback on people who did pay!", "NTA  as by eloping they forgo the full wedding vibe. They cannot have their cake and eat it to by gate crashing your reception for wedding photos.\n\nNot your drama -", "OP says she feels bad because they \"just wanted to have nice memories\" but it's not memories of their own wedding!  They're trying to co-opt OP's wedding so they can pretend it was theirs.  It's ridiculously entitled.", "Thank you, reading the comments has made me feel better. I\u2019ll try to fix things with them but for now I\u2019ll give them space.", "I've known tons of people who have eloped and then did professional pictures later. There's no reason why they couldn't do it on another day at a local garden or something. This level of entitlement is beyond comprehension.", "I wouldn\u2019t have minded her wearing that dress had they arrived before the guests. After all, she could\u2019ve changed clothes after. But it was different when people had already seen her.", "1000%\u2026I think OP was more then reasonable!", "It was one thing to show up in the dress, because people are tacky. \n\nIt's quite another to show up with YOUR OWN PHOTOGRAPHER. \n\nWho hasn't coordinated with the actual wedding photographer and videographer, and is going to, no matter how careful they are, step on some of the bride and groom's shots in an attempt to capture their clients' \"big day.\"", ">The fact they turned up and tried to upstage you at your own wedding is despicable\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they wanted, since they brought the photographer along.", "I\u2019m glad someone else mentioned this was bizarre! I just don\u2019t get it at all!!! \n\nJack and Hannah elope and then want to use OP\u2019s venue, cake, reception, etc like a stage to pose for photos of an event that did not actually happen?!? And brought their own photographer and people to be in the photos?!!?? \n\nNope! Just nope! I\u2019m stunned OP even agreed to any part of an option for this.  It\u2019s like a bizarre Twilight Zone of \u201cThis is MY Wedding\u201d\n\nOP is NTA.  \n\nJack and Hannah seem young and immature and just a tad privileged in coming all dressed in wedding attire, refusing to change, and creating stress for OP on her wedding day.  MOB is just a tad nuts with her attitude of it wouldn\u2019t have hurt just to let them stay and do it and it probably part of the reason that Jack and Hannah thought they could get away with this.  Maybe she even suggested the 1) photos and 2) just come dressed.", "Same.  I would have laughed.\nNTA.", "The problem is they didn\u2019t have enough money for the kind of wedding they wanted, that\u2019s why they eloped :(", "I definitely got that vibe.  Seems odd all the way around.", "This!!!!", "I know my actions weren\u2019t the best, I wasn\u2019t really thinking much at the moment.", "Why?\n\nThis is 100% on them, the gall to even ask on YOUR wedding to take pictures!? Seriously?\n\nYour being far too nice,", "You should spend some time thinking about why you feel guilty in a situation where someone tried to actively take advantage of your kindness. They had multiple chances to not be selfish here -- when you originally told them they could do it before the wedding, when you offered to let them change and rejoin the occasion -- they chose their own happiness over your wedding. It is so, so crass to show up to someone else's wedding in a wedding dress so you can throw yourself a fake wedding.", "They should not have broken off.\n\n\nCongratulation for your wedding", "Your mom suggested it and told them to because she's mad that they eloped. I'd put money on it", "You did nothing wrong and you feel guilty.\n\nThey made an incredibly gross faux pas and I am sure they are not feeling guilty at all. \n\nThose feelings should be reversed. It\u2019s not your job to rebuild a bridge someone else burnt down.", "It's up to them to fix things by offering you the apology you deserve for their atrocious behaviour on your wedding day.", "Also they wouldn't have nice memories because it wasn't there wedding.\n\nJust because people doesn't mean they can't have nice pictures.\n\nWho said who elope don't wear nice clothes.\n\nI known plenty of couples who eloped at the local  registar office in our town.\n\nThe bride has worn a beautiful mostly white and carrying flowers \ud83d\udc90 and the groom looking smart in a suit.  \n\nThey usually took pictures in the botanical garden across the street or the local Park so they end up with beautiful pictures.", "No OP. They are the ones who should feel guilty. You said no, very clearly. It\u2019s a complete AH move to try and steamroll someone at their own wedding to comply with such a ridiculous request. If they want a wedding, then they can pay for a wedding and go all the work to put in a wedding. You are owed a serious apology.", "You have nothing to fix. They owe you and your husband an apology, for trying to upstage your wedding. That's not ok.", "I can't believe you're not angry. You'd be the A H to yourself to give them an apology.  They owe you an apology. She wore a wedding dress to your wedding!!! You told them no and they ignored you. They tried to turn your wedding into a double wedding without paying for it. They literally don't respect  what you say, you're money, or your time  at 1 of the most important days of your life.", "Not your job to fix anything. It's their job and their responsibility. Extremely entitled and majorly rude of them. They were doing it on purpose to get all the attention on them instead.", "Do you think your mom was in on it? That\u2019s she\u2019s sad she didn\u2019t get photos either and told your brother you\u2019d be a little upset but let it slide. I assume that\u2019s why she\u2019s trying to guilt you because she knows your a bit of a push over and told your brother it would be fine and now she feels guilt she got him kicked out and is also upset she didn\u2019t get her photos.", "If that was the case then they should have arrived in their wedding guest outfits, watched your ceremony and then changed into the white dress etc afterwards and taken the pictures when you said it was okay for them to do so. Your SIL literally arrived in a long white dress with a photographer; they were hoping you\u2019d just let them do it the way they wanted and not make a scene on your wedding day. They were bang out of order.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if you think I\u2019m being harsh, you seem like a lovely person. But they were hoping to use your niceness against you to do what they wanted on your wedding day. They chose to elope, therefore they chose to forgo some of the parts of a classic wedding; ie the guests and guest pictures.", "Hon, what was that photographer going to be doing all day?  \n\n1) Capturing candids of your guests at your wedding as if they were at your brother and SIL's wedding. \n\n2) Capturing pictures of them in their wedding attire at your decorated altar in front of your guests before you walked down the aisle. \n\n3) Capturing pictures with your cake. \n\n4) Capturing pictures of the couple at all the most photogenic spots in the wedding and reception venue at the times when the light is best.  Would you have to wait for those spots and that light?\n\n5) Capturing pictures of them with your \"just married\" vehicle as they leave the venue and people toss flower petals/confetti.  Probably before you, so your pictures have a lot of trampled flower petals and fewer people, because those people already saw the show. \n\n6) No doubt capturing the bouquet toss that she'd do.  Father-daughter dance?  First couple dance?", "Well... That sounds like a them problem. \n\nIf they had broached the subject WAY earlier a joint reception may have worked, but it's your wedding, not theirs. \n\nStill not the asshole for kicking them out. You would have had to be a saint to let them stay, and being tricked into something like that doesn't tend to make people saintly.", "They could have held off on the marriage for a bit, until they had the money to have the wedding they wanted. They chose not to. Trying to hijack your wedding was bonkers. Definitely NTA", "That doesn\u2019t give them the right to steal your wedding and pretend that it\u2019s there\u2019s. That is incredibly rude.\n\nYour wedding should be about the combining of your\u2019s and husband\u2019s families. Having another bride and groom waltzing around with their own photographer would be very weird, incredibly distracting for guests, and would probably be upsetting for husband\u2019s family.\n\nWhat they did was shockingly rude, entitled and shows their immense immaturity and disregard for your feelings on your wedding of all days.", "Well, they could've waited and saved up for it.", "Were they even going to help with your photographer payment or did they expect you to just let them tack on this extra favor for free?", "Then they should've waited. They are clearly too immature to make rationale decisions. NTA", "Your brother and his wife showed up to your wedding in full wedding attire, even after you specifically told them not to, and all you did was kick them out? That's not something you just \"let slide\", and your actions were well within reason. You don't need to apologize to anybody over this.", "Oh don't forget the walk don't the aisle. I'm sure they would have arranged that as well."]}
