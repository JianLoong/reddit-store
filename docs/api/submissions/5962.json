About a week before the event, Jack and Hannah asked if they could take their wedding pictures as well after our ceremony and during the reception. I asked if they meant when everything was over but they clarified that they wanted people in the pictures.\n\nThe reason for their request was that they eloped, so they didn\u2019t get to have the whole wedding experience and they wanted the pictures to show their future kids and hang on their future home.\n\nI can understand why they would want that, so I told them that they could take pictures but either before the events or after the guests had left. That\u2019s because they planned to come dressed in wedding attire and I didn\u2019t want them to be wearing that during the wedding.\n\nThey tried to convince me to change my mind but I stood my ground with when they could take the pictures and they ended up saying that they didn\u2019t want to take them anymore. I thought nothing of it and just carried on with my life.\n\nUntil, the day of the wedding they arrived with a photographer and Hannah was wearing a long white dress. The guests had already arrived, so I told my MOH to please tell them to change clothes. Hannah and Jack refused so the groomsmen kicked them out.\n\nAfter the wedding, my mother asked where they were and I told her. She agreed that they shouldn\u2019t have done it but that I could have let it slide since they were already here. She also said that everyone who attended the wedding knew who the couple was, so it\u2019s not like they would\u2019ve caused any confusion.\n\nI\u2018m beginning to feel bad because they just wanted to have nice memories and pictures to show in the future and I ruined it for them. My husband and MOH say that I did nothing wrong but I feel like they\u2019re biased.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n AITA?

Why on earth would they want to show their kids pictures of a story that isn\u2019t even their story?\n\nThis is so weird and out of line. It\u2019s weird they asked and it\u2019s even weirder they pushed through after you said no. You don\u2019t have anything to feel badly about.", "NTA - they did the thing your expressly told them not to, so they could what, skimp out on their own special day? They can put together their own wedding if they want pictures.", "This is insanity aksjdkdjd if they had taken the pictures I would\u2019ve made sure to always point out those lovely wedding pictures were taken at YOUR wedding. NTA", "NTA- You tried to accommodate them, which you had no obligation to do. They chose to elope, chose to forego a wedding and reception, chose to crash YOUR wedding, and chose to disrespect your wishes. There's a couple of AH here, but you aren't one of them.", "NTA.  That's the price you pay for eloping.  You don't get to have all the accouterments that go with a large/formal/\"traditional\" (I know, I know...) wedding celebration.  This was their way of having you plan and pay for the wedding that they didn't want.", "Absolutely NTA. it is completely inappropriate for them to behave that way. If they wanted the lasting memories of a wedding, they shouldn\u2019t have chosen to elope", "NTA. They chose to elope. And wanting photos at someone else\u2019s reception is very odd. I mean, they\u2019re the only ones really who will look at those photos and they\u2019ll know it\u2019s not their wedding. Why not get photos taken in scenic places with themselves and their witnesses to capture their actual wedding? ETA they were really disrespectful to you by doing that, as though your wedding and the guests are props", "NTA weddings are so expensive and stressful to plan. I wouldn\u2019t let someone freeload off of my wedding either.", "NTA they tried to hijack your venue and your day. Screw these selfish bastards.", "NTA.\n\n>She agreed that they shouldn\u2019t have done it but that I could have let it slide since they were already here.\n\nThat's literally why they did it though. They were banking on you letting it slide to save face. \n\nThey were WRONG.", "NTA They wanted to hijack your wedding and probably not just for pics either. They can go through the hassle and expense of planning a wedding if they want the benefits of the wedding. Damn lazy moochers.", "NTA.\n\nWTF. They chose to elope and then tried to use your wedding to take fake pictures. Did they offer to pay for anything? Did they offer to help in any way? I'm sure they didn't. And then on top of that, they crossed your boundary anyway after you told them no.", "NTA they eloped they could have taken pictures then.", "NTA. They chose to elope. They can't have their cake and eat it too. It was your wedding that you paid for. \n\nThey wanted your wedding reception to be their wedding reception.  Why should they get any of that attention on YOURS and YOUR HUSBANDS day? \n\nDo not give them a single cent towards their Photographer. They fucked up, not you. \n\nYou should've told them that if they wanted to use your reception as their own then they needed to pay for half it. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "Big time NTA.\n\nThey chose to elope. Whether to avoid crowds or have to entertain guests, they certainly saved a crap ton of money. \n\nYou and your spouse, along with the wedding party did a lot (assumption here) for your and your spouse's wedding day. You and your spouse EARNED and PAID to be special and be the centre of attention.\n\nYour sibling cannot just swoop on and take all the bloody benefit. As others have said, you are much more generous than I would have been if I were in your shoes.", "NTA.  It's not on you that they decided to elope and didn't have photos.  If it was so important, they either shouldn't have eloped and had a small wedding, or arranged for a photographer at their ceremony.", "NTA. They went against your wishes thinking they could do whatever they wanted which, in my humble opinion, was super rude to do on your wedding day. Your wedding party did what they did to protect you; don\u2019t feel guilty!", "Nta, they made their choice to elope and not pay a photographer. \n\nEvery person I know who eloped or had a tiny city hall wedding chose to pay a photographer to document the day. \n\nThey chose not to.", "NTA. I feel what you offered was more than reasonable. They choose to elope! They can't just hijack your wedding.", "NTA:\n\nlol hell no, you're not in the wrong.\n\nThey didn't listen, even when you tried to compromise.\n\nYou got nothing to feel bad about.\n\nThey were trying be leeches on your wedding day.", "A thousand times this", "What I came here to say!!!!!! Thank you! \nWhen you choose to elope, you CHOOSE not to have the whole wedding experience.", "Agreed! My husband and I \"attempted\" to elope. I wanted those \"wedding\" type photos. So we hired a friend to photograph it all for us. OP you're NTA.", "Why didn\u2019t they just take pictures of the actual wedding they had instead of preceding? Cringy.", "To be fair, you can get a lovely wedding dress without coming within a mile of the budget required to rent a space and feed people, let alone make it pretty, add flowers, add music, etc...\n\nBut yeah, those two are bonkers for thinking they could play dress-up at somebody else's wedding.", "My brother got married at the courthouse and he has lovely photos of him and his wife that his friend took (they live too far away for the rest of us to have been there).  His friend even took video of the ceremony on his phone and so the whole family got to watch.", "Reading OPs replies makes me wonder if she's always had to share her special days like this. She sounds so remorseful, even after everyone has reassured her she's not the asshole.", "They brought their own separate photographer.

NTA, dont get bullied into feelling sorry, try to sit down and have the difficult conversation with them. If that doesn't work, remind them that photoshop exist!", "They were trying to steal your wedding, quite literally.  They saved a pile of money by eloping and then tried to actually have a wedding that they didn't have to pay for by stealing the limelight from you and your husband.  Your brother intentionally tried to fuck you over for his own selfish reasons.\n\nThey are deeply narcissistic, cheap, trash people.  Do not ever apologize.  They owe you an apology, and you would be fully within your rights to not accept it.", "Why can't they go to a photo studio and have a nice professional picture taken of them in their wedding finery. That's the way it was done in the past and they'll have the opportunity to look just right in the photos. Unless they were planning to lie to their kids, it would be obvious to everyone that this was not their wedding.\n\nMaybe everyone kicks in for the professional photo shoot and throws them an anniversary party.", "If they wanted to full wedding experience they should have done that. It\u2019s crappy they wanted to capitalize on your party in an attempt to hang their \u201cwedding photos\u201d at home", "They lied to you. That\u2019s on them. You did nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA your brother and sil behavior was tacky and entitled. First of all they asked and you said no. If it was so important to them to have these types of pictures then they should have postponed getting married and saved up for their own wedding. Instead they attempted to take pictures that would make it look like your wedding was their own. Lastly it\u2019s very commonly known that you don\u2019t wear a wedding dress to someone else\u2019s wedding.", "NTA. If they wanted the wedding experience, they should've had a wedding. \n\nMy partner and I are planning on eloping with just one sibling each as a witness. We'll take pictures on the day. \n\nNever in a million years would I ask my sister if we could take wedding pics at her wedding. And dressed in wedding attire???????? Nope. No. No.\n\nEdit: apparently i can't spell \ud83d\ude2c", "Holy matrimony, batman! NTA! \n\nDon't feel guilty that you held your boundaries. \n\nWhat they tried to pull was beyond rude. You offered a compromise, they rejected it, and then tried to force your hand. They should feel badly, not you.", "They tried to get a diluted wedding on your dime. \n\nWhy can\u2019t they have a wedding ceremony and do their own since they want that? Could it be because they can\u2019t afford it? So wanted to use the services you paid for? \n\nNTA", "This is why they thought they could get away with it. They were playing on your kindnes and caring nature. You can be kind and caring but also not let people walk all over you. They didn't respect you or your wedding. They intentionally tried to ruin your wedding, the one you paid thousands of dollars for, b/c they wanted to take all of your hard work and money and pretend it was theirs.\n\nIt sounds like your mom raised you to be a pushover. If you haven't already, you should find a therapist to help you work through this. This is absolutely nothing you should feel guilty about.", "Literally they can plan a photo session w a photographer any time. They eloped, the story and memory of their wedding was that no one was there. They just want to pretend they had a big family wedding when they did nothing of the sort. Nta op, don't pay them a cent.", "I feel like in the future, these are people that will probably always want more from you than what they are willing to put in the relationship. What they did was very selfish and disrespectful and not something people would do lightly. You were very reasonable and handled this well. Congrats on your wedding!", "I hope you understand what everyone's telling you: basically, we're trying to tell you that the *request* alone was already really, really abnormal on their part. Them not accepting your refusal and showing up like that is beyond abnormal and all the way into a level of selfish self-involvement that is downright cruel. You should NOT be feeling guilty or hoping to fix it; if there's any repairs to be made, that is on THEM to put in the work to reflect on how amazingly wrong they were and to apologize to YOU from crossing your boundaries to this degree.\n\nUnderstand, please, that they chose to elope (a choice). They chose to not host their own event (a choice). They chose to try to demand the use of YOUR event and venue (a choice). Know what they could have done? Had a wedding, or invited everyone to an event of their own - hell, they could've had a picnic at a nice park or the like! Instead, they chose to try to make themselves the stars of YOUR story.\n\nPlease stop blaming yourself and recognize just how heinous they really have been.", "> She agreed that they shouldn\u2019t have done it but that I could have let it slide since they were already here.\n\nThey were banking on this, so in effect, your mother is saying 'they should have done it because they were relying on you to buckle'.

I understand you feel bad about it because it is a sibling but you did nothing wrong.  \n\nAlso, think about it from the photographer\u2019s point of view, they were going to work double when they were paid for one couple.", "This!\n\nAnd what do they believe they will tell their future kids in their future home about this photo?\n\n\"Oh kids, let us tell you the beautiful story of this photo... it's the picture of us dressed up as newly weds at aunt and uncle's actual wedding... nice memories of pretending it was our wedding for a fake wedding photo... really worth the drama we created with our entitlement!\"", "\"The guests had already arrived, so I told my MOH to please tell them to change clothes.
