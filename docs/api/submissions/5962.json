About a week before the event, Jack and Hannah asked if they could take their wedding pictures as well after our ceremony and during the reception. I asked if they meant when everything was over but they clarified that they wanted people in the pictures.\n\nThe reason for their request was that they eloped, so they didn\u2019t get to have the whole wedding experience and they wanted the pictures to show their future kids and hang on their future home.\n\nI can understand why they would want that, so I told them that they could take pictures but either before the events or after the guests had left. That\u2019s because they planned to come dressed in wedding attire and I didn\u2019t want them to be wearing that during the wedding.\n\nThey tried to convince me to change my mind but I stood my ground with when they could take the pictures and they ended up saying that they didn\u2019t want to take them anymore. I thought nothing of it and just carried on with my life.\n\nUntil, the day of the wedding they arrived with a photographer and Hannah was wearing a long white dress. The guests had already arrived, so I told my MOH to please tell them to change clothes. Hannah and Jack refused so the groomsmen kicked them out.\n\nAfter the wedding, my mother asked where they were and I told her. She agreed that they shouldn\u2019t have done it but that I could have let it slide since they were already here. She also said that everyone who attended the wedding knew who the couple was, so it\u2019s not like they would\u2019ve caused any confusion.\n\nI\u2018m beginning to feel bad because they just wanted to have nice memories and pictures to show in the future and I ruined it for them. My husband and MOH say that I did nothing wrong but I feel like they\u2019re biased.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n AITA? If I am I\u2019ll apologize and offer to pay them back for the photographer.", "created_utc": 1672353862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyizme/aita_for_not_allowing_my_brother_and_his_wife_to/", "score": 4449, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We had an immediate family only wedding, so I don't have the same extended family photos of my wedding that my sister does. It sucks a bit, but we since we had no idea how long the covid restrictions on large gatherings would go on, we decided we would rather be married than have a big ceremony. We plan on having a large reception someday, maybe for our 5 year anniversary, and I plan on potentially having the pictures done then. They could absolutely do the same thing if they wanted. Or not, if that isn't a big priority for them. \n\nIt is INCREDIBLY SELFISH of them to try and hijack your wedding and your photographer that you paid for to get their wedding photos.

It still would have been totally acceptable to say no, of course, but I'd bet they didn't, and that coupled with ignoring your wishes for your own wedding day shows that they were not thinking of you in any way, shape, or form. \n\nPlease do not feel guilty for not letting selfish people take away from you and your spouse's wedding day. \u2764\ufe0f", "Nta - they were planing to ignore your no and take over your photo time.

Your request was completely reasonable, and easy to honor.  I agree with trying to forgive, repair the relationship and move forward.

Eloping is a big choice, more popular these days but still a HUGE choice to leave things out, like large fam photos, even if the reason for eloping was out of their control (illness, military, K-1 visas, etc.) There are so many options for them, so why your wedding? Why not ask to pull family aside during events that lead up to the wedding that you could share where family would be there? Brining their own photographer is a HUGE red flag as that would get you in trouble since more vendor contracts have some exclusivity clause where they can be the ONLY vendor of that type at the event. The wearing white is cultural but important here- why didn't they just take photos at your event wearing whatever fancy clothes with those family members at the photo booth or during cocktail hour with their own device? No. They made it a point to wear white and hire someone so they went out of their way to overstep your clear boundaries. Hiring a photographer is expensive to begin with so it is not like they didn't have a vendor or a way to pay for it; you were very generous offering a compromise and, again, as someone who eloped and only has a handful of pictures, their choices are their responsibility not yours. Same as people who try to take advantage of event photographers for engagement photos or pregnancy announcements after the couple said no, they are being 110% rude.", "NTA, and to be honest you did them a favour by getting them out of there, they avoided looking super weird.\n\nRelax, put it out of your mind and think about other nice things.", "They chose to elope and therefore chose to not have traditional wedding photos.

They need to respect your boundaries because that was a massive breach of them with no regards to you whatsoever.", "You are far kinder to them than they deserve for their behaviour! What they did was incredibly disrespecful to you, your husband and your guests.\n\nI understand that weddings can be expensive, but they needed to either work with their existing budget, or, if they really had their hearts set on a big, fancy wedding reception, they needed to wait and save up for that. It sounds like they had enough money to buy a wedding dress and hire a photographer, so they could have easily arranged for a photoshoot on another day with close family and friends somewhere scenic like a park or botanical gardens. Instead, they tried to selfishly co-opt the venue and decor you and your husband organised and paid for despite you having said you weren't comfortable with them having their photoshoot in front of your guests. I'm mad on your behalf!", "That\u2019s not your problem though.", "Yeah, but you can also have a wedding without inviting 200 people for a 3 course meal in the dream place and skip things that arent need to have but nice to have. \nPrioritees. But yeah, I know the dress isnt the biggest expence in a wedding! \nIt just seems like entitled and childish to me to do it the way they did!", "I hope the 2nd photographer took a non-refundable deposit!", "She\u2019s the one who\u2019s asking for a picture she can put up. And also who\u2019s been spoiling her baby boy to the extent that he thinks he could get away with using his sister\u2019s wedding as a backdrop.", "They didn\u2019t even need to hold off on the marriage, just the wedding. \n\nThe idea that they *had* to elope because they couldn\u2019t have the wedding they wanted sounds odd to me. Almost like a kid deciding because they can\u2019t have a slice of cake, they *have* to eat a whole tub of ice cream instead. There\u2019s the option of simply have a smaller, cheaper version of the wedding they wanted, still with family included (even if it\u2019s only the close family that can afford to travel). Why were their only two options have the exact wedding they want with all their family, or elope and marry without (I\u2019m assuming) any family or photos?", ">I\u2019m honestly surprised at this point that they weren\u2019t expecting OP\u2019s wedding photographer to do their photos as well and have OP pay for them\n\nI'll admit that that's what I thought too.", "Indeed", "Indeed", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the mother was in on it, even a proponent of it. She\u2019s wanting their wedding photos to put up.\n\nI expect that they left to go do posed photos somewhere else, since they\u2019d hired their photographer. (Even bringing that additional person into OP\u2019s wedding was way out of line.) OP should wait to see what comes of that. Meanwhile try to deprogram herself from the conditioning she\u2019s grown up with, that her relationship with her brother is supposed to be 100% on her.", "Hubby and I eloped on our 10th anniversary, and we had hubby's best man/witness took some awesome photos.\n\nOP, you're NTA, but everyone who is telling you, you should have let it slide certainly are. You did the right thing, they wanted to hijack your special day, good job for not letting them.", "They did, however, try to piggyback on a whole ass wedding. Which is so unbelievably entitled, I almost feel an angry kind of respect forthem. \n\nAnd I would love to hear the thought process behind this. 'Hey babe, since we eloped and didn't plan on paying for a big wedding, how about we just seize OP's wedding and get the whole experience for free?' \n\nAt this point I wouldn't have been surprised if they had brought their own cake.", "Don't do that. Don't be such a pathetic people pleaser. They made the mistake, they can fix it. You don't do anything.", "Yeah, they need to fix things with you.\n\nBURN THE BRIDGES!", "**THEY** have to fix things with **YOU**! Direct anyone who says otherwise to this thread", "Why do you need to try to fix things? You did nothing wrong. They owe you and your husband an apology, you owe them nothing.", "I'm late to this, but genuinely ask why they thought this was acceptable. They wanted to wear their wedding clothes to your wedding. They wanted to rope your guests into their pictures, meaning you'd have to figure out how to get your own photos, they likely wanted to use your photographer, and did they think it would be acceptable to sit through the ceremony and the reception in bridalwear? \n\nWere they planning to cut your cake and elbow their way into the first dance as well? Genuinely, what is wrong with them? Why would they make your wedding about themselves? They eloped, they didn't want a wedding, so they don't get to snatch away yours and then have a tantrum because they were told to go home. They went against your wishes, violated your boundaries, and were disrespectful and selfish. They had the chance to change. They did not. They wanted to bulldoze you into doing what they wanted. Ask them why they think this was okay, please. I honestly want to know.\n\nAnd ask your mother if she'd have allowed that at her wedding. Would she have allowed someone to stay at her wedding in a wedding dress? Why does she feel you should have caved in and let them stay?", "Why don\u2019t they plan a reception? They can wear their wedding attire, cut the cake, get pictures with family and friends, OH, WAIT! Then they\u2019d have to pay for it. Nevermind.", "And that's why most people either have the wedding they can afford, or hold off for a while until they can afford the wedding they want.", "You are NTA. You would've been one towards your husband and his family if you had let them stay and intrude on your wedding, so it's good you had your wedding party there to help you stand your ground.\n\nThem not being able to afford the wedding they wanted is not your fault or your problem to fix. Most people cannot afford a big wedding just like that. That is why people *save money* before their wedding. If they wanted a big wedding, they should have waited and saved. If they wanted a big wedding that absolutely couldn't wait (unlikely unless one of them is terminally ill), they should have loaned money from a bank. That is what adults who are mature enough to get married do: they live and plan within their means.\n\nNot being able to afford a big wedding right away gives them no excuse to steal your day, your venue, and your guests for their pretend-photoshoot. Had you let them stay, they would have definitely wanted pictures of their first dance etc. too, and then you would've just ended up having a double-wedding on your dime. Why did they want pictures with just your family there though? Surely your SIL's family wasn't at your wedding, so it definitely sounds like your mother wanted the pictures too and maybe didn't like that they eloped.\n\nAlso, your mother's logic of \"well they're in the wrong but they're already here so you should've let them stay\" is mega-assholery-bullshit of the highest order that really makes me think she was in on this. You told them no before they showed up in wedding attire with their photographer, and they did not respect your very reasonable boyndary. You gave them much more generous options than their outrageous request deserved (I hope not without consulting your husband first).\n\nThey 100% counted on you having a bleeding heart and being unable to turn them away once they committed to it. Being kind is great and all, but do not be a doormat. Letting them intrude on your wedding on your and your partner's expense would have made you a doormat and unkind to your husband, not kind to them. It sounds to me like this is not the first time your mother has expected you to \"be the bigger person\" when she actually wanted you to bend over backwards for your brother's sake.\n\nDo not apologize and ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PAY for their photographer or gift them a photoshoot like some commenters are suggesting. Do not in any way reward their appalling behaviour. The \"boo hoo we are too poor to have X, pay for ours or let us take yours\"-grifting will never stop if you set a precedent that you will give in eventually. They cannot afford something? Then they need to save up like everyone else. They are adults now so do not coddle them like babies.", "That\u2019s not your problem maybe they should have waited and saved for one instead of trying to steal yours. Do not give them any money, do not apologize for standing up for yourself and tell mom it was not ok what they did.", "That\u2019s their problem, not yours.", "Why do you keep defending them & feel sorry for them? They\u2019re grown adults. If they don\u2019t have enough money, that\u2019s their problem. They could choose to save for years, like most rational people do & then have their wedding. I personally would rather not wait years to save for a wedding, so I went & eloped, because being married to my husband was more important to me than some wedding.", "this isn't your problem.\n\nmy husband and i didn't have enough money for a wedding photographer, so we were gonna have my brother's friend take pics of us. (luckily a coworker was herself a photographer and she gave me an insane deal, so we have beautiful pictures).\n\nWe didn't have money for a wedding venue so we held it in my parent's back yard. We didn't ask others for money or anything and it was an amazing experience i wouldn't trade for the world.\n\nmy point is: They're adults. They can handle their own finances and that's a THEM thing. You are not responsible nor should you feel obliged to NOR should you be guilted by anyone for your actions.", "At this point, I wouldn't give them anything tbh", "Favourite variation so far! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe", "It almost sounds like a plot for a cring comedy movie or show."]}
