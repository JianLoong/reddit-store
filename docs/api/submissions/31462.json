The submission of women in patriarchal cultures and polygamy being accepted but not polyandry being two of them.", "Just because it's cultural doesn't mean it's a good thing in modern times. The Persians used to eat their dead and the Inuit used to kill old people for being slow.", "Ooh cool! Thank You", "I hope you do. It's fun!", "How can you say no one does this when I work with about 400 Japanese people and a good 30-40% of those people implement this", "That\u2019s pretty normal in a traditional Japanese marriage. It\u2019s oddly matriarchal in some ways.", "Oh, I agree that they need to talk more about it.\n\nBut I was specifically addressing the 'embarrassment' comment.", "How would they have the wife's bank details?", "NTA, this is a weird thing that needs to be broken. Bad precedent. Also, if you think she\u2019s going to change when you leave Japan I think you\u2019re going to have a big wake up call.", "This here. I noticed he didn't say they talked about it and it will be different when they move to Australia, it's like op thinks they get off the plane and boom suddenly his wife isn't Japanese? \n\nAlso, if he has no idea how much money they have/spend then how does he know that they don't need that money to pay rent ect? To suddenly have half the money you are used to coming in as the person managing the finances without warning could put you in problems? \n\nThis whole thing makes so little sense when in the time it took op to write this he could have said \"hey wife, can I have more money available to me while my parents are here because of reasons 1,2,3...\"", "I don't think they're saying that if you agree to something you're bound to it for life.  They're saying if you want to change an agreement you've made, you need to communicate that and not just up and change it with no discussion.", "I agree, but in the current situation, I also think it is equally unreasonable for him to just be like I know I have no idea how much money we have, how much our bills are each month, but I've decided on my own that I am only going to contribute half as much to the joint finances this month, cause I might get embarrassed in front of mommy and daddy.", "Or if one spouse is financially abusing the other spouse, or even physically abusing them, how would one spouse ever leave the other if they have no money to do so", "You missed out the part where I mentioned that when we move to Australia she has already agreed to do it my way as it\u2019s another lifestyle and another method. I tried her method and I don\u2019t like it but I\u2019m doing it. I want to change it for one month and one month only. I have never changed the agreement in two years. I want to change it just once as this month we have a special scenario happening. \nShe has already agreed to changing to my way of saving when we get to Australia. You\u2019re now making the assumptions", "> They are superior in pretty much every way possible and that does tend to cause jealousy in men\n\nI\u2019m sorry?", "As someone else pointed out, only 50% of Japanese people do it this way, and most of those who do are older. It is not as if OP's wife would be shamed if they did not follow this practice.", "While individuals choose, the choices availed are predicated upon the inspirations they have been exposed to. There are such things as cultural influences. You may choose to go with or against history or normalcy regarding any given set of choices, but you are always choosing to be more with or more against a norm within the boundaries of your society. To pretend otherwise is egotistical and misleads the self into false originality, not individuality.", "That\u2019s not the majority, if anything it\u2019s the minority that do this.", "thats a pretty low % tbh", "The husband would have use the wife\u2019s bank account when setting up all the paperwork!!", "Then just tell her. Otherwise with hiding it or not talking about it it's like your scared. While I do not like how this will sound it's like your a child doing something wrong knowingly and hiding it. If you can't even talk to her about this then your at fault for any problems that happen due to this. Besides that if your giving her your money in full every month then she knows how much you make or at least a ballpark of it. Meaning she knows your holding out on her and are now just being to scared to have an actual conversation about why. Before she lets her imagination run wild talk to her as your partner in life about why your not handing over everything instead of trying to avoid a conversation.", "You\u2019re not giving us much detail here. Why not just ask her if you can do it that way this month? Or did you ask and she\u2019s resistant?", "So what's so hard about telling her? Cause if you don't sit down to talk to her and she finds out later, she's going to be questioning you on what else you have hidden from her and frankly no one would blame her because you've then marked yourself as a liar.", "You agreed to letting her control the money. Not something I would ever do, but each to their own.\n\nHowever, did you also agree for her not to let you have any visibility of the money?\n\nAt an absolute minimum, you should be able to see how much money is in the accounts.\n\nNTA for wanting access to money to spend when your parents visit. If you explain this to your wife, surely she would understand?", "Right? Real casual eugenics shit just slipped right in there.", "He sounds like a real Asian fetishizing creep", "Yeah that was my second thought, either gross eugenics nationalism or gross fetishization."]}
