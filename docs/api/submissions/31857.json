{"id": 31857, "submission_id": "18543zw", "title": "AITA for fighting for our spot against a lady a a concert?", "selftext": "I (6'2, 85kg, 48m) and my (4'11, 38f) wife went to see Blur yesterday in Buenos Aires.\n\nShe is a huge fan of Graham Coxon so we managed to get a spot at 2 or 3 persons from the rail on the left side of the stage. I am standing right behind her with my hands on her shoulders most of the time.\n\nAfter a while, 2 ladies arrive, I'd say maximum late 40's, and I can sense that one of them, significantly taller than my wife, is actually trying to sneak her way in front of me. By that, I mean placing her feet (or trying to) in front of mine, her arm/shoulder in front of mine etc... It's all very subtle but that's what I think she's doing.\n\nThere start the passive agressive game between us. Every little move she makes, I counter with a little move to block her. There are still 2 concerts before Blur on that stage, so the moves become less and less subtles until Becks starts.\nThere she's blattantly pushing me and I, and that's where I could be the AH, was actually pushing back, forcing myself in front of her so she wouldn't have an option to sneak in front of us.\n\nOh did she get mad... A man behind me told me to be careful with a woman, I was pissed off so I just replied in English that if she was not harrassing, elbowing or kicking me, she would be fine. Another man (maybe with her at the concert, not sure), told me she was not in a very comfortable place, and I should also calm down, I replied the same and even pointed her to move on the other side of me where there actually was a little space, and obviously a better point of view but she replied madly that I should move there and she could be my mon (lol, are you 70 !!?? I asked her, me all in English and her all in Spanish).\nIt got to the point she tried to involve security who was first asking me to go to the back to talk it out. My wife (Argentinian), who was first getting mad at me for all the pushing, had realised by then what was going on, talked to the security guy, and after a just literaly 15 secs \u201dintervention\u201d he just went back to his job, and nobody ever told me anything anymore, because they could all witness what had happened. My wife asked me to move slightly on the side, which I did, Beck went off stage and Pet Shop Boy started on the twin stage next on the left side so no problem anymore as I was not blocking her view anymore. \n\nI never saw her during Blur, probably because oh shit, it gets really pushy and probably she didn't like it...\n\nNow my wife still think I'm an AH for reacting like that to a woman, that I could have gotten us kicked out of the front, and I have to accept that other people have a right to exist too. To which I replied that me too have a right to exist, and if we arrive early enough to take a good spot, on top of it, of her choice, we are entitled to keep it and not let everybody in front of us just because \"they have a right to exist\".\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1701095060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18543zw/aita_for_fighting_for_our_spot_against_a_lady_a_a/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve been to a ton of shows and festivals and often arrive early (or pay exorbitant extra fees) to be on the rail. There\u2019s always people (though the demographic leans heavily female) trying to sneak in and take your spot up front. I swear they try to exploit the fact that most men aren\u2019t gonna confront a woman to take your spot. Don\u2019t let them, it\u2019s total bullshit.", "NTA\n\n\"Thou shalt not cut in line\" is the first commandment at sporting events, concerts, parades, and any other open seating/standing events.  You got there early, and that spot was yours.", "NTA\n\n>A man behind me told me to be careful with a woman\n\nThis is exactly what she was trying to achieve. I've been a concert freak all my teens and young adult years, the entitlement sometimes was insane. To the point that you had to be careful about girls twerking on your crotch just so their boyfriends would get angry and throw you outside (like I am making her twerk on my balls).", ">I mean placing her feet (or trying to) in front of mine, her arm/shoulder in front of mine etc\n\noooohhh I *know* that concert move. I *hate* that concert move.\n\nNTA. You were there first, so you were just holding onto your claimed spot. As long as you weren't actually hurting her. Next time - just put her on the spot \"are you trying to get in front of me?\"", "I love the pushing and jockeying for positions.  That's a battle with few rules .  I am 6'3 and 200 lbs and if I want to stand in front of the stage I will do so, and if you are behind me and cant see , then don't be behind me.  nobody is entitled to anything in the mosh pit", "Woman or man, don't start none, won't be none.\n\nNTA", "ES H for being more excited over Blur than the Pet Shop Boys\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, she was being aggressive", "NTA she was being ridiculous. Also your wife is awesome for specifically liking Graham Coxon. Maybe it\u2019s just the people I\u2019m around but I feel like he doesn\u2019t get enough individual credit.", "NTA. You don't owe every woman a spot just because you are a man. If she wanted that spot she should have gotten there before you did.", "Nta if it happens again, LOUDLY say, 'Please stop pushing me to get in front of me!'  Calling someone out on their shit behavior has a 50/50 chance of working.", "Pet Shop Boys, Beck and Blur??  I'm super jealous.  NTA", "NTA you were there first and she started it. You shouldn\u2019t have to give up your spot that you waited for regardless of your height.  Plus it\u2019s not like you were blocking from seeing the entire stage. Your hands were on your wife.  I don\u2019t know how rough you were though.  You might not have known your own strength.  I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.  Your wife will forget about it just don\u2019t bring it up with her again.", "NTA - had a similar issue when me and brother went and Saw Iron Maiden, guy had his kid on his shoulder and tried to bum rush through everyone.  He did not make it far and everyone made sure to put him quite a ways away.", "your wife\u2019s logic doesn\u2019t make sense \u2026 you were there first and you have the right to exist peacefully too \n\nNTA", "[deleted]", "Sorry but that's not how thing works in CAMPO (where I assume he went) in Argentina. That is a f*** war zone.\nThey push, they elbow you, it's just how thing are in Campo. \nI went to a Taylor Swift concert in River Plate and it was just like that. \n\n\nNTA.", "It did cross my mind that she would play the card of sexual harrassement  so I was very obviously leaving my hands on my wife's shoulder. But then she miracoulously disapear when Blur came on stage :)", "Well, I tend to be more considerate and not put myself in front of people who were there long before me.\nIf I arrive late, I won't push through people to pass.\nIf then it gets wild and the whole crowd shuffles a lot, well not the same. But I will never do it in a malicious way.\n\nEdit to add more : I you try to pass in front of me by force, I will fight it with all my body :)\nAs of now, nobody ever could make me lose the rail if I am attached to it :)", "Sorry, not a big fan of them ;)", "Yeah ! He deserves so much more attention !\nWe saw him solo in Paris years ago, in a small venue. He was at like less than a meter from us :)", "I'm actually the very quiet enjoying the music inside my head, head that I barely move anyway.\n\nOnce 23 years ago I was at a muse concert right in the middle of the crowd in a small venue, one of the rare times in my life I could let go :)\n\nIf you look for another muse gig, in Marseille in 2000 on youtube, you'll see my head and my then long hair hovering above everybody in my typical concert behavior.\n\nAbout my strength, yeah that 's pretty much why I might have been the AH here, but she definitely wasn't hurt, things would have gone differently I guess...", "So he sucks because he didn\u2019t just let this lady push him and his wife out of the way????", ">They push, they elbow you, it's just how thing are in Campo. \n\nAH, then OP should continue to stand his ground with the pushing and the moyven-flaven!", "Yes, in campo :) but it was very quiet, even for Beck! Except for the odd people trying to push their way to the front.\nHonestly, we saw Blur before in France, in 2014, and was much wilder than yesterday :0 !", "often when the headline band starts up there is a surge.  small people get crushed.", "I'm just salty.\n\nI missed out on seeing their west end production a few decades ago, and I just missed them in concert a few months ago.", "You have good taste in music!", "Yes I know, if the whole crowd is wild, nothing much to be done but trying to survive indeed ! \nEven though, can be done with a minimum respect :)", "Thanks !", "Yeah I\u2019ve played footsie with people at concerts before, having arrived earlier than them, and I (5\u20194\u201d woman) won\u2019t stand for it. Try to crowd me and elbow me? You\u2019ll get the same right back, and then some for good measure. I hate that bullshit.", "NTA. She should never have touched you or tried to push you out of the way. You and your wife were there first and staked out a good spot. She needed to pick a place that was open rather than being a jerk.", "I agree, and I am a small female. If I have a very tall person in front of me I will ask politely if I can get in front of them as they will see easily over my head, I will never push, shove, elbow my way through people who were there before me. I also will not let people push, shove, or elbow me out of my good spot.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you were hitting her or anything. Concerts are always a lot of pushing and shoving and why should you have to give up your spot for her when you were there first? Honestly, I\u2019m avg height (f) and I had to deal with some girl pushing in front of me at a concert and thankfully some stranger (also f) stood up for me and pushed her away. So yeah NTA, she\u2019s the asshole. If you don\u2019t stand up for yourself, that is what encourages these people to repeat their behavior (which can be said for basically any entitled person in a public space, highly encourage standing up for yourself over suffering in silence when u can).", "NTA if you really want good GA positions you show up early and get it. Fuck EVERYONE who shows up late and pushes their way to the front.", "100% NTA. I\u2019ve had people try this at concerts, and I\u2019m not having it. Women will try to inch in like this one did, and men will try to push their way in front of me. Nope, sorry, I stood in line for 4 hours to get that spot. I\u2019m defending it.", "NTA\n\nEqual rights.\nHad the tables been turned be certain you\u2019d have been excoriated by everyone there.", "NTA but your wife is a huge Ah for not seeing that you were protecting her and her space.  Major bad move on her part to place blame at your feet.  Seriously - what is her issue?", "I had a visceral reaction to reading that concert move.", "Well don't worry about that ! Like I said, when she realised what's happened, she was completely on my side and supporting me.\nShe's the non confrontational kind and she was actually seeing us being kicked out because here (me being French and living here for only 2 months), she says, and I believe her, that people being rude, especially to women, will be particularly targeted by a crowd.\n\nAnd the security guy asking me first to talk about it in the back did comfort this impression.\n\nAlso me reacting like that to a woman is not something she likes so much and I can understand this general feeling.\n\nShe saw this post and the general reaction of you redditors, so yeah she's accepting that it was not an overreaction from me :)", "You're giving me flashbacks to the last concert I went to a year ago. It was maybe 4 mins before start time, fully packed venue without much space to stand and this very short, petite chick decided that was the best time to sit on the damn ground. Dunno wtf she was doing, looked like maybe sneak vaping but I was terrified she was going to get crushed. My husband and I just stood there watching like panicked parents.", "NTA."]}
