Our dad and his wife died three months ago. Mine and Calla's mom died when we were younger, dad and his wife had been married for 4 years. His wife had a daughter, Lacey, who is now 5. When CPS became involved because both were left orphan's, I stepped up to take my sister. I was already working full time since I skipped college and I just about had what I needed to take care of my sister. They asked me about Lacey and I told them I just wanted to take my sister.\n\nLacey was placed with her grandparents, my dad's ILs. They became aware of the fact Calla came to live with me and that I had been offered the chance to take their granddaughter and refused. Once they learned this they asked me why, and then pestered me about it for weeks. Finally they told me they were older and she could use as much family as possible and that she misses Calla (she wouldn't really remember me). I asked Calla if she wanted to see her and she said not really. So I told them we were not interested in staying in their granddaughter's life. They told me she's our little sister, that my dad would have wanted us to stick together. I told them I didn't care what my dad wanted. They said not to punish a child for the sins of my parent. I blocked them and continued on with things until they sought me out on social media via one of their older grandkids and told me that I should be ashamed of myself and their granddaughter deserves to be with her siblings and be raised by me since I'm young, fit and healthy and could run around after her like they can't, and will be around a lot longer than them. I replied once that their granddaughter is not my responsibility and that I wanted them to leave me and my sister alone, because we have no reason to be in touch ever again.\n\nThat wasn't the end and they called me selfish and cruel a few times via another account. So I had to set my account to private to stop them.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Making clear that Lacey was my dad's stepdaughter, not his daughter.\n\nETA2: I am a guy, not a girl. Just wanted to point that out because I have noticed a couple of people use the wrong pronouns for me and figured adding it here would help.\n\nETA3: Some info that keeps being asked. The bio dad is not on the scene. He could be dead but I really don't know. He never seemed to be in the picture though. He could also be unknown or something but there is no bio father involved. I also was not close to my dad. Neither was my sister. There was a lot of stuff involved there but I was no contact with him and everyone but my sister for more than a year before he and his wife died. So I had nothing to do with Lacey for more than a year.", "created_utc": 1672309171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy1zuf/aita_for_telling_my_late_dads_ils_that_their/", "score": 2234, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When my dad's ILs who took his stepdaughter after he and his wife died reached out to me a few times to get me and my sister in her life again and to have me raise her with my sister, I said no, and the last time I told them she was not my responsibility. The reason I ask the questions is I know from my sister that Lacey (dad's stepdaughter) was really fond of her, called her sister, loved her even though it was one sided and I can imagine that this has been extra tough on her because she lost.

They need to figure out how to provide care for their granddaughter.", "If I understand correctly Lacey was not your sibling, she was the daughter of your dads wife from an earlier marriage.\n\nWhy would you want to raise a kid that is not family?\n\nNTA", "You are 19 years old. Taking care of a 15 year old is a LOT different than raising a 5 year old. Sounds like Lacey isn\u2019t even related to you. NTA. Her relatives can work it out amongst themselves. Guilt tripping a 19 year old is beyond the pale.", "NTA. Your dad\u2019s in-laws are awful, trying to pressure you when you\u2019re 19, you\u2019ve just lost your father and you\u2019re already taking care of a 15yo. You\u2019re completely right, you\u2019re not responsible for the child and she\u2019s no longer any relation to you. You need to be able to get on with your life and taking care of someone else\u2018s 5yo would really restrict you.   \nStay strong and stand your ground. Best of luck.", "NTA. Lacey is not your responsibility.", "NTA.\n\nYou're a 19 year old guy and you've already stepped up to become a guardian for your younger sister. You've done a kind thing there.\n\nI feel super bad for little Lacey. She's an innocent little girl and she's lost both her parents (and, from her perspective, her big sister too) BUT, and it's a massive but, that little girl is not related to you and she's not your (or your sisters) responsibility.\n\nIf you did take her in, it would impact on your life and your sisters life greatly. It would be a lifelong responsibility to take on a little girl. Your sister is different. She's a blood relative and 15. She can look after herself to a certain extent and certainly doesn't need to be watched the same way a 5yo would.\n\nLacey's grandparents are massive AHs for trying to guilt you into taking Lacey in.\n\nMaybe one of the older grandkids could take her if they feel so strongly about this.\n\nOp, you are NTA. I'm glad you blocked her grandparents. I wish you and your sister all the best.\n\nEDITED to correct a mistake.", "Yeah NTA. An older sibling is fair enough. They are functional and just need a bit of big brother guidance through the next few years at most. Plus the odd kick up the arse when they think they're an adult. Aswell as yourself. At 19 is a hell of a responsibility to be taken on a 5 year while still just getting your foot out the door in the 'real' world.\nSorry the grandparents are inconvenienced by your decision but they would be in a better position to deal with a youngen full time. \nSorry for your loss may the grind of life be less barbaric than what you've already had to endure.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP! \n\nYou are absolutely NTA! They\u2019re just looking for someone to take care of her because kids are not easy to look after!", "NTA, you are young and you try your best to care for you sis, Lacey is not blood related and apart from that, asking a 19 year old to take on two kids is unreasonable.", "NTA. You mentioned Lacey\u2019s grandparents have older grandkids, so why can\u2019t any of the other kids/grandkids (who are actually related to Lacey) take her in. Wouldn\u2019t it be in her best interest to be surrounded by real family?", "Nta. Look i get it the kid is only 5 and it sucks for her. However its not ops fault. The fact that the grandparents are trying to put the burden of raising a child on a 19 year old is disgusting and disturbing. This doesnt even have do with family. There is a HUGE difference in raising, parenting, and financially supporting a 15 year old vs. A 5 year old. To tell op that this responsibility falls to him alone is b.s. and ridiculous to anyone with some common sense. Again it sucks for the kid but not at ops fault or his burden to bear.\n\nEdited to change where i called him a her, my bad.", "NTA. She's not your relative.", "NTA!!!!  They expected you to adopt a little girl who you were not related to.  And you said no.  And they did not respect that.  Wow.", "NTA - It\u2018s fantastic and an incredible achievement that you are able and willing to provide for Calla. \n\nAs for your dad\u2019s IL, they simply just want to guilt trip you into caring for Lacey, so they don\u2019t have to and they can go back to the child-free freedom they had gotten used to.", "NTA.  Anyone pressuring you, and your first question should be why don\u2019t you do it?  Please block them on everything.  It sounds weird though, their daughter died and trying to get rid of a biological link to their daughter?  Now that is cold.", "NTA. It is tough enough for a 19-year-old to take care of himself (possibly juggling education and earning a living). It is even harder to take care of his 15-year-old sister. \n\nBut it is close to impossible to also take in a 5-year-old. It is very insensitive of the grandparents to even expect that if you'd be a full or half sibling. It is madness to expect it from an unrelated stranger.", "NTA kids are a huge responsibility. You are still young. Being burdened by a child to take care of has a huge impact on life. \nWhile some of the arguments on why the IL may not be a great choice are valid. It does not mean you have to take the load out care for it. \n\nIt's a shitty situation but you are not the AH.", "NTA. Caring for a 15 year old is very different from caring for a 5 year old. Where's Lacey's biodad and his family in all of this?\n\nI am curious, you were 15 when your dad married Lacey's mom. Were you kicked out? Why wouldn't Lacey remember you?", "Taking morals out for a second, and just taking the logistics of it into account, a 15 year old is a lot different than a 5 year old. You're 19, and working. You're not even established fully into the adult world yet, and already taking care of one child.\n\n That's a lot. And probably the only reason why you're able to  because at 15, most teens are fairly independent, and don't require much supervision. But a 5 year old needs constant supervision, and child care. The costs alone would hurt you tremendously. That issue isn't as much for a 15 year old.\n\nLogistically, taking care of a 15 year old is a lot easier than a 5 year old.\n\nMorally, you were always in the clear there. And I think you are a wonderful brother by taking care of your 15 year old sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you are doing great. Ignore them and focus on you and your sister. Hug!", "NTA. You were honest with them from the beginning and you\u2019re not obligated to take on additional responsibility that you don\u2019t want.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 19 taking care of your little sister. You both suffered major losses and taking care of a toddler shouldn't be out on you. I hope the best for you and your sis.", "NTA. And if they have other grandkids, aren\u2019t they or their parents (i.e., Lacey\u2019s aunts/uncles) better suited to take care of her? I just don\u2019t understand why they aren\u2019t looking closer to home for this.\n\nIn any case, looking after your 15 year old sister at 19 is one thing. Looking after a 5 year old that you barely know at 19 is something else. I cannot imagine that there aren\u2019t others in your stepmother\u2019s family who are in a better position for this.\n\nSo sorry for your loss, and best of luck to both of you.", "Jeeze.  All these people on here thinking you are TA astound me!  You\u2019re 19.  Your path for the next few years is to look after your sister and help her become a functional adult where, technically, you really shouldn\u2019t be a functioning adult yet\u2026 but you are.\n\nAfter you normalise life with your sister, focus back on your own life.  And no, your late father\u2019s step-daughter is not your responsibility.  You\u2019re just being an awesome older brother to your sister.  If you took in the 5-year old, you\u2019d have to be a dad.  Shame on the grandparents for not seeing that you\u2019re still a teenager!\n\nNTA x1000", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. It\u2019s awesome that you stepped up and took in your sister.", "NTA\n\nYou're so freaking young and already caring for your sibling. They shouldn't be even asking this of you. It's a *huge* commitment on every aspect of life. *Especially* due to the age difference. It's sound just like they wanna dodge their responsibility.\n\nETA: get in touch with CPS or any other authority to report their harassment if you need, you two already went through enough. It's not the kid's fault but you are right to preserve yourselves.", "NTA\n\nDocument everything - every attempt at contact, every new social media account created, every person they\u2019ve persuaded to reach out to you, every name they\u2019ve called you, every response you\u2019ve sent telling them to stop, LITERALLY EVERYTHING - and file for a protection (or intervention) order. They are harassing you and ignoring your requests to leave you alone and they need to stop.\n\nYou\u2019re wonderful for taking on the care of your sister. Good luck to your both. I hope your dad\u2019s ILs realise they need to let this go and be there for their granddaughter instead of focusing their unwanted (and hopefully soon illegal) attention and hate on you.", "Heavy on NTA. It would be nice if you did take Lacey however and I feel strongly on this .. it\u2019s not your responsibility either . YOURE ONLY 19 !. I\u2019m just not understanding what\u2019s not clicking to Lacey\u2019s family . They know just as much as I know it\u2019s a big difference taking care of a 15 y/o vs a 5 y/o\u2026 I get it the grandparents are old but your stepmom\u2019s family can step in way more and help the grandparents more if it\u2019s becoming to much on the grandparents instead of being childish making facebook post .", "NTA. You are just starting out in life and your sister deserves to have her own freedoms and time to deal with the loss in her own way.  Lacey isn't blood and while they may struggle,  it sounds like there are other family members capable of helping (i.e., older grandchildren who can navigate social media). It sucks for the 5yr old,  but you don't have any obligations and have every right to live your life.", "NTA. Your 19!!! You are already taking on way more than normal for someone your age.", "NTA it's not your responsibility. The other one wasn't your responsibility either so good on you for taking her in. Where is this girl's dad?", "NTA you are not responsible for a step sibling. The child\u2019s maternal and paternal family are. Sounds like she does have other blood relatives who are quick to criticize you but not step up. Keep blocking them this is not your responsibility. Good luck to you both.", "Nra!!  This is perplexing - why are they balking at raising their late daughter's kid ?and pushing so hard?", "It is unreasonable to assume you, at age 19, are willing to take on the care of a child who is not related to you or your sister.  The child has been placed with her own relatives, if they don't want to take care of her, that's their problem, not yours.  \n\nThey are selfish and cruel for their rejection of the child.  No doubt they offered no incentive or financial help to take her on.\n\nAlso I doubt a 15 year old and 5 year old have much in common, even if they were being raised as 'sisters'.  \n\nIt is possible you or your sister might might be entitled to some support for college or other things.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I would consider consulting with a lawyer and having them draft a cease and desist letter to not contact you or your sister again.", "You are not related and have nothing to do with the 5 year old, they are TA and are just trying to get rid of her. they also have other grandchildren who are older, they can take care of her as they are actually related. Tell them to go f themselves and document all their abuse incase you need to get restraining orders.", "NTA. Her grandparents doesn't wanna take responsibility of her so they're dumping her on OP, which is pretty sad for Lacey since she's innocent in all this. OP is already doing a great job by taking in his sister. If OP was not in the picture or not capable of taking care of Calla, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't do sh-t for Calla.", "NTA, but I do feel sorry for Lacey. She\u2019s so young and probably does miss Calla.  Is there a reason she doesn\u2019t want to visit her?", "NTA. From your edit I see you aren\u2019t even related to the other child.  Good luck and you are a good man stepping up for your sister!", "NTA. These people have some nerve calling you selfish for not wanting to parent a child at 19 when it\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t even want her themselves. It is a hard situation for the little girl but ultimately she would be better off with people neither too young or too old do care for her, that actually want her around. Tons of homes out there are willing to adopt kids 5 and under.", "NTA. A 19 year old guy is already taking guardianship of his 15 year old biological sister. He does not need to be responsible for a 5 year old step sister that barely knows him.", "Lacey is not your blood relative.  Her grandparents are not your blood relatives.  If they continue to harass you and stalk you in an attempt to give this child to you, consider sending them a legal letter requesting they stop contacting you and stop harassment of you.  This **is** harassment and you do not deserve this.", "NTA. While I understand grandparents concern, they have no right pressuring you into taking such a big responsibility. Taking care of a 15yo is totally different than a 5yo. \nWhile you have no obligation to do so, I would reconsider completely shutting little girl out of your life, since your father was her father figure as well (unless you didn't didn't get along with your father at all)", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA they should be ashamed of themselves for not offering to take all three of you in.

A 15 year old can be trusted to cook for herself and be able to be alone but not a 5 year old. You\u2019d need to find babysitters and the cost and commitment needed to take her in are far more than your sister. It is an unfair expectation for anyone, let alone you who is only 19 yourself", "They're out of their mind, to begin with you only have a responsibility towards your sister. And lucky for you she's 15 and can pretty much take care of herself.

Putting aside the lack of familial relationship (blood and bond), taking in a 5 year old is very different from taking in a 15 year old. Your sister is at least three years away from finishing school and beginning her adult life. She doesn't need a babyditter/daycare, she can handle day activities in ger own, etc. Taking in the 5 year old would mean committing 13 years of your life to being a single parent. Send the in-laws a cease and desist letter. Warn them thst continued attempts to cotact you will result in you going to the police for harassment.", "NTA. It's sad, but it wouldn't benefit this child to be with someone she doesn't know. This is why people should establish guardianships just in case something happens to them.", "NTA no blood relation, there isn\u2019t anything linking you genetically to her", "Taking care of a 14 year old and taking care of a 5 year old are completely different things. You\u2019re so young and taking on that responsibility would be world changing. NTA AT ALL", "NTA, block them all. They wanted you to take care of the toddler so that they don't have too. The cousin was worried the toddler may become his responsibility when the grandparents passed.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to look after your dads stepdaughter.

You have enough on your plate. Hell I\u2019m 37 and a single father and still struggle with it from time to time.\nKeep up the good work.", "NTA. She is not your responsibility. You are already taking on a lot.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your child or even your sister; therefore, not your responsibility.", "NTA.\nYou are 19 yourself your sister is independent in most of the things because she is a teen.

If you guys had all grown up together I would have a different opinion than the one I have.\n\nAs it is, you are 19 dealing with the loss of your father. This comes after your own mother passed away leaving you and your sister now without parents. It's a major expense to carry her on at such a young age. \n\nThe grandparents should be a lot more mature about this. Just because you're young doesn't mean you're the best choice.

There is huge difference between looking after a 15 year old and a 5 year old, even if they were both full siblings. You aren't technically related, and they require way more time and effort.

I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nHowever, I understand where Lacey's grandparents are coming from, they just lost their daughter and they may not feel prepared for raising a 5-year-old. They're grieving, overwhelmed, and probably just lashing out. They might be feeling their own mortality and the prospect of Lacey still having 13 years of childhood ahead of her. Life is shit sometimes. \n\nYou don't have a moral or legal responsibility to them, do what you need to do to get through and if that means ignoring them so be it.

You\u2019re pretty much still a child yourself, who\u2019s jumped headfirst into adulthood before you should have had to. \n\nTaking in your 15 year old sister is extremely different than raising a 6 year old. \n\nCalla will pretty much raise herself. She can work with you to take care of the home and she will be joining the workforce in a few years too. She will need your guidance and support, but you won\u2019t need to parent her too much. Hopefully Calla has a good head on her shoulders and that she avoids getting herself into trouble - you might want to see if she wants to go on birth control soon and I\u2019m sure that will be an uncomfortable conversation,  but will hopefully be the most parent-like you\u2019ll need to be. \n\nLacey on the other hand needs a full-time parent figure.

Agreeing to take care of someone for 3 years full time is a much smaller ask than for the next 13 years of your life which almost all of a child\u2019s formative years and 5 is wayyyyyyy more challenging when you\u2019re just barely a legal adult.", "NTA.

Our dad and his wife died three months ago. Mine and Calla's mom died when we were younger, dad and his wife had been married for 4 years. His wife had a 5 year old daughter Lacey. When CPS became involved because both were left orphan's, I stepped up to take my sister. I was already working full time since I skipped college and I just about had what I needed to take care of my sister. They asked me about Lacey and I told them I just wanted to take my sister.\n\nLacey was placed with her grandparents, my dad's ILs. They became aware of the fact Calla came to live with me and that I had been offered the chance to take their granddaughter and refused. Once they learned this they asked me why, and then pestered me about it for weeks. Finally they told me they were older and she could use as much family as possible and that she misses Calla (she wouldn't really remember me). I asked Calla if she wanted to see her and she said not really. So I told them we were not interested in staying in their granddaughter's life. They told me she's our little sister, that my dad would have wanted us to stick together. I told them I didn't care what my dad wanted. They said not to punish a child for the sins of my parent. I blocked them and continued on with things until they sought me out on social media via one of their older grandkids and told me that I should be ashamed of myself and their granddaughter deserves to be with her siblings and be raised by me since I'm young, fit and healthy and could run around after her like they can't, and will be around a lot longer than them. I replied once that their granddaughter is not my responsibility and that I wanted them to leave me and my sister alone, because we have no reason to be in touch ever again.\n\nThat wasn't the end and they called me selfish and cruel a few times via another account. So I had to set my account to private to stop them.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Are the grandparents willing to pay you handsomely, or would you gain any of the insurance money from the girls mothers death to pay for her upkeep?  Furthermore, how would the grandparents feel if you moved away for work, taking their grand daughter with them and they lost contact with her?  That would get very, very messy.\n\nWould your decision change if Lacey came to live with you along with the life insurance and a regular payment from the grandparents to cover cost of living and housing?

First off, there is a big difference between taking care of a 15 year old and a 5 year old. The level of commitment, responsibility, and financial hardships are vastly different.

She is likely able to fend for herself meal wise so long as you ensure there is food in the house. \n\nMy own 15 year old is responsible for their own laundry, making small meals for themself when I'm at work (12 hour shifts where it's well past dinner when I get home.) And some minor household chores. Things kids pf this age need to know how to handle because they are only steps away from potentially leaving the nest.\n\nThat 5 year old will require much more supervision. Daycare costs for when there's no school but you still have work. And that's a HUGE cost let me tell you. Could be more than half your paycheck depending on amount of hours needed. And you'll have to work to support those kids.\n\nNo. You're NTA and your father's inlaws don't give a rats ass about how you and your sister would fare in life.\n\nIn the end though it would have been nice if the 5 year old could have had visitation with the girl they bonded with as a sister.

Lacey needs a stable family life, they know how that should look better than a 19yo (you\u2019d think anyway).

I know you're an adult but you're only 19, and to have both your parents pass and be the sole guardian of your younger sibling is heartbreaking. I hope you have a good support network of friends and hopefully other family (ideally adults over 25yo) to offer help and support. I'm so sorry that you're having to go through all of this and not even being able to grieve properly due to the bombardment of harassing messages from these people. \n\nYour dad and stepmother should have had a plan in place for guardianship for Lacey. You shouldn't even have to have the responsibility of your sister, let alone a sibling you're not related to. If the in-laws really cared about 'family', they'd be offering you help and support with Calla and for yourself since according to their logic, you should be their family too. If they're not fit to care for a 4yo and no other family wishes to step up, then she'll become an orphan to the state. It's an awful thought but it's not on you. That's their decision and their business as her guardians now. \n\nIf you have the time, I'd seek out legal advice with regards to Calla and mention the harassment from your dad's in-laws. It wouldn't do much about the harassment, but it would start a record in the event you need it further down the line. \n\nAgain, I'm so sorry for your loss and this hardship you've got to deal with.

Good for you for standing up for yourself and your sister.", "OP is NTA. He's doing the right thing by taking in his 15 year-old sister; but asking a 19 year-old to become a single parent to a 5 year-old is unreasonable. With that said, however, I am troubled by how indifferent & uncompassionate both OP & his sister sound regarding the little girl's situation. No, she's not their responsibility or blood relative, but jeez, show a little kindness! To just cut her off completely -- no contact, no phone calls, letters, or visits -- is heartless & cruel. That poor little girl has just lost her parents, and now someone she regards and probably loves as her big sister has also totally disappeared from her life. That's traumatizing for a young child; she's going to have major abandonment issues when she grows up.", "You are NTA for only taking your sister. Taking care of a sibling it a lot of responsibility and recognizing you don\u2019t want to/aren\u2019t able to also care for a 5 year old is good.

Sometimes you gotta be an asshole to take care of yourself and what's important in your life, which is your sister. \n\nIMO, which is worth jackshit, you did the correct move. You're 19, and attempted saddling a young adult who is newly navigating adult life with a 5yr old child is a chicken shit plea.

It sounds like he moved out from his father\u2019s home as soon as he could, which strongly suggests he didn\u2019t have a good relationship with his father and stepmother. There\u2019s no significant contact for him to cut. Lacey may be attached to Calla, but it\u2019s not mutual and a 15yo shouldn\u2019t be required to keep in touch with the 5yo either.", "And what kind of idiot wants a teenager to be responsible for raising a little kid? Most grandparents help out when their 19 year old has a child of their own. Expecting a teenager to raise a kid that isn\u2019t even theirs is absurd. Even in the best of circumstances I wouldn\u2019t want a 19 year old to have to raise a kid. They are still kids themselves!", "I will tell you that it would be a cold day in hell when I let my grandchild, the only connection left to my deceased daughter, be raised by strangers.  I will never understand this reasoning.  I know some people don\u2019t have the ability but really? Literally no one in the whole family is willing?", "If you're family, where is their assistance to you and Calla right now? Or does that \"family\" only flow one way?\n\nPlease don't feel bad that you're not in a position to take in another child. You and Calla have a tough enough road ahead. I hope you both shine.", "NTA\n\nIf Lacey's mom had died but your father was still alive, then it might have been reasonable to expect him to have continued to raise her since he was presumably her father figure. But that responsibility definitely doesn't fall on you or your sister. \n\nThey clearly think that they can bully you into assuming ***their*** responsibility. Did you establish a good rapport with anyone in CPS? I wonder if it would help to contact them and let them know about all the pressure you are receiving as well as giving them the names of all of Lacey's other family members who are not stepping up to the plate. \n\nOr perhaps you can try and find a sliding scale legal aid service in your area. I think a  cease-and-desist letter from a lawyer might do a world of good in getting this family off your back. And definitely go no contact with them.", "you get to decide for yourself now, what that word means to you and your sister.  Don't let people push you around because they're older.", "Imma edit where i said her, my bad, and thanks for catching that for me.", "NTA again, mainly because you are not Lacey\u2019s blood relative, you didn\u2019t have a relationship with her. She is not your responsibility.", "Well if they keep bothering you tell them to go find him. The girls father has more responsibility than you do.", "I'm so sorry that you are being harassed by these people. It sounds that the 5 year old has plenty of adults in her life who should be using their energy to raise her instead of spewing toxicity in your direction. NTA and may you and your sister have a wonderful life full of love, health and positivity.", "You did nothing wrong and don\u2019t let anyone feel like you did. I feel bad for you too dealing with all this while starting your young adult life. All the best to you.", "Then no worries.  Definitely NTA", "Thanks for the clarification!\n\nI hope her grandparents stop pestering you and everything goes fine with your sister.", "\"other people from her family\" who are actually related to her by blood.", "Even if the 5 year old was your full sister, there is an enormous difference between caring for a 5 year old and a 15 year old. At a minimum 15 year olds are relatively self sufficient, 5 year old can not be left alone.\n\nYou are doing a great thing for your sister.\n\nStep grandparents and the rest of the family are TA!!!!", "OPs own sister isn't his responsibility either, technically. He's already a saint for taking her in. Asking this young man who is barely an adult to take in yet another child, one who would need a ton more care and supervision than a 15 year old who he doesn't know and isn't related to? Absolutely not reasonable at all.", "The only thing I can think of is if Lacey is desperate to see her siblings.  I just don't see that happening with a 5 year old wanting to see a 15 and 19 year old.  Even then, it could just be meeting, not living with.\n\nIt sounds like the grandparents just want to wipe their hands of the kid.  OP, don't feel bad at all.  19 years old and looking after your own sister is extremely noble.  I wish you both the absolute best, you're doing a very good thing and deserve massive props for it.\n\nI'm going to guess it's also a million times easier for a 19 year old to look after a 15 year old (that's also lost her parents) then it is to look after a 5yo.  The 15 year old is pushing adult years (the maturity that's been thrust upon her is almost as much as what's been put upon you, and being pushed into parenthood at 19, without any possible parental support, is about as big as it gets) so your sister can probably look after herself somewhat, with some brotherly support.  A 5yo can't look after herself at all.", "Grandparents and other adults related by blood who would rather force a 5yo on to someone who doesnt want to have to look after them than to take care of her themselves. OP is NTA for not feeling obliged or able to take care of a 5yo that requires a far bigger and far longer commitment than his 15yo sister. \n\nI'll also add that the fact OP's sister presumably lived with the 5yo step-sister for 4 years and doesnt even want to see her seems odd. Im suspecting there is something we dony know about in all this. And as OP is working and making enough to take in his sister only Im guessing there is no inheritance.", "I've not seen any mention yet of the grief of losing your last parent, it's not just an extra mouth to feed. \n\nSurely you're grieving too, they are her blood relatives, you're taking on enough responsibility at a tough time as it is. I would have figured after losing their daughter they would like to keep their granddaughter close, not leave her with people she barely has a relationship with.\n\n*Edit to add NTA", "This is exactly what I wanted to say. Even if you were close to the 5 year old (which you aren't) how the hell would a 19 year old with (presumably) a starting position with a company raise a 5 year old and a 15 year old?", "That's what I was thinking. Getting a 15 year old through the last years of high school and preparing her for college or the military or the workforce is going to be challenging but VERY different from raising a tiny child.", "Also if they found OP by one of their older grandkids... why aren't those same grandkids or their parents stepping up if the problem is needing someone younger? Grandparents should do that rather than harass two teenagers grieving.", "Thanks for the info!", "Yeah, where is the bio-father in all of this?", "And how much do you bet the grandparents really wanted that grandchild?\n\nThey just didn't want to do any actual hard work involved in raising her.", "I have no idea. I don't know these people at all.", "I completely get that but a 5 year old kid would never understand this. I\u2019m not saying he has to stay in daily contact with her, but at least having a conversation with her every once in a while or even at only special occasions would be the kind thing to do (this is more so towards the sister than OP). Imagine losing your parents and whom you thought were your family all at the same time without even being able comprehend the reason why. \n\nOP is doing a great thing by taking responsibility for his younger sister and being able to support them both overall. I just can\u2019t help but feel bad for the kid that\u2019s innocent in all of this. Again I do not think OP is required to take in Lacey, she\u2019s not his financial responsibility.", "but what about then step daughters bio father and family?????never mentioned here", "Right?!?!  The hypocrisy is suffocating. NTA", "It\u2019s hysterical that they\u2019re screaming \u201cFaMiLy\u201d at OP for why he should take in Lacey when they\u2019re the ones trying to pawn her off. Would love to see their reaction if OP pointed that out.", "You are 19 years old and you are taking care of your sister. You both suffered a great loss, and caring for young children shouldn't weigh you down.I wish you and your sister the best of luck.", "This 1000%. Even if they were super close a 19 year old taking in a five year old is a bit much. I don\u2019t think the 5 yo would have been placed with with the grandparents if they weren\u2019t equipped for the job.", "YES.  \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Doesn't seem like it. The grandparents were but it sounds like they expected someone else to step up and do it eventually.", "And blame OP for the kid\u2019s failures.", "They\u2019re talking about the sister 15f because the 5f Bio grandparents mentioned Lacey missing her. Like it was an excuse to not support their biological grandchild", "NTA , also where is Lacey's dad or did I miss it ?", "I don\u2019t get the grandparents at all. Not only do they not want to take care of their granddaughter, whose mother died, they are expecting a 19-year-old to raise two kids? He still a child himself. Nobody finished raising him. He lost all his parental figures. I feel equally as bad for him as I do the five-year-old. The family that she has left doesn\u2019t want her.", "Yeah, this is literally the plot of Lilo and Stitch\u2014that it\u2019s darned hard for a 19-year-old to care full time for a small child.", "If the girl was their blood sister, and/or if there was a strong emotional bond between the three of them, I'd say OP should take her in. It would be hard. There would be a lot of overtime hours for him, and a lot of after school babysitting for Ms. 15, but sometimes the hard thing is the right thing. \n\nThat's not the situation here. The little girl has her own family. And I hope they're not exposing her to all of this drama. Losing a parent and stepparent is bad enough. It would be much worse to know that nobody really seems to want her.", "Also: if you are the beneficiary of your dad\u2026 when tax season comes, look into uncollected taxes. The irs has a list. It might not be much\u2026 but I imagine in your situation every little bit of cash helps. My dad just got a couple hundred dollars from my grandma\u2019s uncollected taxes.", "You as a college student ALSO get death benefits until age 22, those could easily be $25-50k from 19-22.  But you have to stay in school.", "Wild. Honestly, I think you have a lot of great reasons why you raising Lacey wouldn\u2019t even be in her best interest, is Ben outside from the simple fact that you don\u2019t want to, which should be enough under these circumstances. I don\u2019t know if, in their panic/grief, they haven\u2019t considered them, but if they keep reaching out, I would write them a letter stating all of that and legal action I.e. I\u2019m sorry for your loss\u2026this has changed your life as well, so you understand they may be overwhelmed but perhaps they aren\u2019t fully considering that\n\u2014You don\u2019t want to.\n\u2014L is a virtual stranger. Neither you nor your sister have bonded with her and attempts to force this situation on the three of you runs the very real risk of leading to resentments on all sides that will be detrimental to all parties.\n\u2014 They seem bewildered by the fact that while they think you should consider L fam, you don\u2019t, particularly since you haven\u2019t even seen her in over a year. If they, as adults, feel that way about you, a virtual stranger not taking on this responsibility, have they even thought about how L will feel to know that they, her biological grandparents with whom she shares emotional bonds, aren\u2019t taking it on and are in fact trying to get the 19year old they barely know who was only legally related to her, to shape her entire childhood?\n\u2014They have other, older grandchildren. Which means they presumably have other children who are you get than them, but older than you and have theoretically raised kids. Why are they not asking Lacey\u2019s aunt(s)/uncle(s) for assistance? \n\u2014Even if financial issues aren\u2019t a factor (not sure from your post and I know sometimes trusts and insurance policies/inheritances mitigate those) aside from the age issue, you did not have a good relationship with your dad and pretty much no relationship with her mom. Pretty much anyone else in their family will be able to give L a better sense of her mother and create bonds with that family than you.\n\nAnd then remind them that your decision is final and you don\u2019t want to have to take further steps to stop them from continuing to request what they\u2019re asking, but they should be aware that you may be willing to do so if they don\u2019t stop on their own.", "Calla is innocent in this too, though, and didn\u2019t even get along with her late father. Also, since Lacey\u2019s grandparents\u2019 plan would probably involve Calla having to do a lot of the care for Lacey, it\u2019s reasonable \u2014 even if seemingly harsh \u2014 for Calla to try to make a complete escape from such expectations.", "INFO: Why aren't these other relatives (who are harassing you) stepping up and taking care of their cousin?", "Did CPS offer any type of help? How you\u2019re describing it it sounds like the three of you out to dry.

Being a guardian to his 15yo sister should be a lot more manageable since she\u2019s old enough to not need childcare. So the kid\u2019s grandparents are trying to shove responsibility for their young grandchild off onto a barely-adult teenager who the kid doesn\u2019t even know and isn\u2019t related to, and probably expect the 15yo to be parentified as part of this.
