Our dad and his wife died three months ago. Mine and Calla's mom died when we were younger, dad and his wife had been married for 4 years. His wife had a 5 year old daughter Lacey. When CPS became involved because both were left orphan's, I stepped up to take my sister. I was already working full time since I skipped college and I just about had what I needed to take care of my sister. They asked me about Lacey and I told them I just wanted to take my sister.\n\nLacey was placed with her grandparents, my dad's ILs. They became aware of the fact Calla came to live with me and that I had been offered the chance to take their granddaughter and refused. Once they learned this they asked me why, and then pestered me about it for weeks. Finally they told me they were older and she could use as much family as possible and that she misses Calla (she wouldn't really remember me). I asked Calla if she wanted to see her and she said not really. So I told them we were not interested in staying in their granddaughter's life. They told me she's our little sister, that my dad would have wanted us to stick together. I told them I didn't care what my dad wanted. They said not to punish a child for the sins of my parent. I blocked them and continued on with things until they sought me out on social media via one of their older grandkids and told me that I should be ashamed of myself and their granddaughter deserves to be with her siblings and be raised by me since I'm young, fit and healthy and could run around after her like they can't, and will be around a lot longer than them. I replied once that their granddaughter is not my responsibility and that I wanted them to leave me and my sister alone, because we have no reason to be in touch ever again.\n\nThat wasn't the end and they called me selfish and cruel a few times via another account. So I had to set my account to private to stop them.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Making clear that Lacey was my dad's stepdaughter, not his daughter.\n\nETA2: I am a guy, not a girl. Just wanted to point that out because I have noticed a couple of people use the wrong pronouns for me and figured adding it here would help.", "created_utc": 1672309171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy1zuf/aita_for_telling_my_late_dads_ils_that_their/", "score": 501, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When my dad's ILs who took his stepdaughter after he and his wife died reached out to me a few times to get me and my sister in her life again and to have me raise her with my sister, I said no, and the last time I told them she was not my responsibility. The reason I ask the questions is I know from my sister that Lacey (dad's stepdaughter) was really fond of her, called her sister, loved her even though it was one sided and I can imagine that this has been extra tough on her because she lost.

They need to figure out how to provide care for their granddaughter.", "If I understand correctly Lacey was not your sibling, she was the daughter of your dads wife from an earlier marriage.\n\nWhy would you want to raise a kid that is not family?\n\nNTA", "You are 19 years old. Taking care of a 15 year old is a LOT different than raising a 5 year old. Sounds like Lacey isn\u2019t even related to you. NTA. Her relatives can work it out amongst themselves. Guilt tripping a 19 year old is beyond the pale.", "NTA. Your dad\u2019s in-laws are awful, trying to pressure you when you\u2019re 19, you\u2019ve just lost your father and you\u2019re already taking care of a 15yo. You\u2019re completely right, you\u2019re not responsible for the child and she\u2019s no longer any relation to you. You need to be able to get on with your life and taking care of someone else\u2018s 5yo would really restrict you.   \nStay strong and stand your ground. Best of luck.", "NTA. Lacey is not your responsibility.", "NTA.\n\nYou're a 19 year old guy and you've already stepped up to become a guardian for your younger sister. You've done a kind thing there.\n\nI feel super bad for little Lacey. She's an innocent little girl and she's lost both her parents (and, from her perspective, her big sister too) BUT, and it's a massive but, that little girl is not related to you and she's not your (or your sisters) responsibility.\n\nIf you did take her in, it would impact on your life and your sisters life greatly. It would be a lifelong responsibility to take on a little girl. Your sister is different. She's a blood relative and 15. She can look after herself to a certain extent and certainly doesn't need to be watched the same way a 5yo would.\n\nLacey's grandparents are massive AHs for trying to guilt you into taking Lacey in.\n\nMaybe one of the older grandkids could take her if they feel so strongly about this.\n\nOp, you are NTA. I'm glad you blocked her grandparents. I wish you and your sister all the best.\n\nEDITED to correct a mistake.", "Yeah NTA. An older sibling is fair enough. They are functional and just need a bit of big brother guidance through the next few years at most. Plus the odd kick up the arse when they think they're an adult. Aswell as yourself. At 19 is a hell of a responsibility to be taken on a 5 year while still just getting your foot out the door in the 'real' world.\nSorry the grandparents are inconvenienced by your decision but they would be in a better position to deal with a youngen full time. \nSorry for your loss may the grind of life be less barbaric than what you've already had to endure.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP! \n\nYou are absolutely NTA! They\u2019re just looking for someone to take care of her because kids are not easy to look after!", "NTA, you are young and you try your best to care for you sis, Lacey is not blood related and apart from that, asking a 19 year old to take on two kids is unreasonable.", "NTA. You mentioned Lacey\u2019s grandparents have older grandkids, so why can\u2019t any of the other kids/grandkids (who are actually related to Lacey) take her in. Wouldn\u2019t it be in her best interest to be surrounded by real family?", "Nta. Look i get it the kid is only 5 and it sucks for her. However its not ops fault. The fact that the grandparents are trying to put the burden of raising a child on a 19 year old is disgusting and disturbing. This doesnt even have do with family. There is a HUGE difference in raising, parenting, and financially supporting a 15 year old vs. A 5 year old. To tell op that this responsibility falls to her alone is b.s. and ridiculous to anyone with some common sense. Again it sucks for the kid but not at ops fault or her burden to bear.", "NTA. She's not your relative.", "NTA!!!!  They expected you to adopt a little girl who you were not related to.  And you said no.  And they did not respect that.  Wow.", "NTA - It\u2018s fantastic and an incredible achievement that you are able and willing to provide for Calla. \n\nAs for your dad\u2019s IL, they simply just want to guilt trip you into caring for Lacey, so they don\u2019t have to and they can go back to the child-free freedom they had gotten used to.", "NTA.  Anyone pressuring you, and your first question should be why don\u2019t you do it?  Please block them on everything.  It sounds weird though, their daughter died and trying to get rid of a biological link to their daughter?  Now that is cold.", "NTA. It is tough enough for a 19-year-old to take care of himself (possibly juggling education and earning a living). It is even harder to take care of his 15-year-old sister. \n\nBut it is close to impossible to also take in a 5-year-old. It is very insensitive of the grandparents to even expect that if you'd be a full or half sibling. It is madness to expect it from an unrelated stranger.", "NTA kids are a huge responsibility. You are still young. Being burdened by a child to take care of has a huge impact on life. \nWhile some of the arguments on why the IL may not be a great choice are valid. It does not mean you have to take the load out care for it. \n\nIt's a shitty situation but you are not the AH.", "NTA. Caring for a 15 year old is very different from caring for a 5 year old. Where's Lacey's biodad and his family in all of this?\n\nI am curious, you were 15 when your dad married Lacey's mom. Were you kicked out? Why wouldn't Lacey remember you?", "Taking morals out for a second, and just taking the logistics of it into account, a 15 year old is a lot different than a 5 year old. You're 19, and working. You're not even established fully into the adult world yet, and already taking care of one child.\n\n That's a lot. And probably the only reason why you're able to  because at 15, most teens are fairly independent, and don't require much supervision. But a 5 year old needs constant supervision, and child care. The costs alone would hurt you tremendously. That issue isn't as much for a 15 year old.\n\nLogistically, taking care of a 15 year old is a lot easier than a 5 year old.\n\nMorally, you were always in the clear there. And I think you are a wonderful brother by taking care of your 15 year old sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you are doing great. Ignore them and focus on you and your sister. Hug!", "NTA. You were honest with them from the beginning and you\u2019re not obligated to take on additional responsibility that you don\u2019t want.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 19 taking care of your little sister. You both suffered major losses and taking care of a toddler shouldn't be out on you. I hope the best for you and your sis.", "NTA. And if they have other grandkids, aren\u2019t they or their parents (i.e., Lacey\u2019s aunts/uncles) better suited to take care of her? I just don\u2019t understand why they aren\u2019t looking closer to home for this.\n\nIn any case, looking after your 15 year old sister at 19 is one thing. Looking after a 5 year old that you barely know at 19 is something else. I cannot imagine that there aren\u2019t others in your stepmother\u2019s family who are in a better position for this.\n\nSo sorry for your loss, and best of luck to both of you.", "Jeeze.  All these people on here thinking you are TA astound me!  You\u2019re 19.  Your path for the next few years is to look after your sister and help her become a functional adult where, technically, you really shouldn\u2019t be a functioning adult yet\u2026 but you are.\n\nAfter you normalise life with your sister, focus back on your own life.  And no, your late father\u2019s step-daughter is not your responsibility.  You\u2019re just being an awesome older brother to your sister.  If you took in the 5-year old, you\u2019d have to be a dad.  Shame on the grandparents for not seeing that you\u2019re still a teenager!\n\nNTA x1000", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. It\u2019s awesome that you stepped up and took in your sister.", "NTA\n\nYou're so freaking young and already caring for your sibling. They shouldn't be even asking this of you. It's a *huge* commitment on every aspect of life. *Especially* due to the age difference. It's sound just like they wanna dodge their responsibility.\n\nETA: get in touch with CPS or any other authority to report their harassment if you need, you two already went through enough. It's not the kid's fault but you are right to preserve yourselves.", "NTA\n\nDocument everything - every attempt at contact, every new social media account created, every person they\u2019ve persuaded to reach out to you, every name they\u2019ve called you, every response you\u2019ve sent telling them to stop, LITERALLY EVERYTHING - and file for a protection (or intervention) order. They are harassing you and ignoring your requests to leave you alone and they need to stop.\n\nYou\u2019re wonderful for taking on the care of your sister. Good luck to your both.

It would be nice if you did take Lacey however and I feel strongly on this .. it\u2019s not your responsibility either . YOURE ONLY 19 !. I\u2019m just not understanding what\u2019s not clicking to Lacey\u2019s family . They know just as much as I know it\u2019s a big difference taking care of a 15 y/o vs a 5 y/o\u2026 I get it the grandparents are old but your stepmom\u2019s family can step in way more and help the grandparents more if it\u2019s becoming to much on the grandparents instead of being childish making facebook post .", "NTA. You are just starting out in life and your sister deserves to have her own freedoms and time to deal with the loss in her own way.  Lacey isn't blood and while they may struggle,  it sounds like there are other family members capable of helping (i.e., older grandchildren who can navigate social media). It sucks for the 5yr old,  but you don't have any obligations and have every right to live your life.", "NTA. Your 19!!! You are already taking on way more than normal for someone your age.", "NTA it's not your responsibility. The other one wasn't your responsibility either so good on you for taking her in. Where is this girl's dad?", "NTA you are not responsible for a step sibling. The child\u2019s maternal and paternal family are. Sounds like she does have other blood relatives who are quick to criticize you but not step up. Keep blocking them this is not your responsibility. Good luck to you both.", "Nra!!  This is perplexing - why are they balking at raising their late daughter's kid ?and pushing so hard?", "It is unreasonable to assume you, at age 19, are willing to take on the care of a child who is not related to you or your sister.  The child has been placed with her own relatives, if they don't want to take care of her, that's their problem, not yours.  \n\nThey are selfish and cruel for their rejection of the child.  No doubt they offered no incentive or financial help to take her on.\n\nAlso I doubt a 15 year old and 5 year old have much in common, even if they were being raised as 'sisters'.  \n\nIt is possible you or your sister might might be entitled to some support for college or other things.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I would consider consulting with a lawyer and having them draft a cease and desist letter to not contact you or your sister again.", "You are not related and have nothing to do with the 5 year old, they are TA and are just trying to get rid of her. they also have other grandchildren who are older, they can take care of her as they are actually related. Tell them to go f themselves and document all their abuse incase you need to get restraining orders.", "NTA. Her grandparents doesn't wanna take responsibility of her so they're dumping her on OP, which is pretty sad for Lacey since she's innocent in all this. OP is already doing a great job by taking in his sister. If OP was not in the picture or not capable of taking care of Calla, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't do sh-t for Calla.", "NTA, but I do feel sorry for Lacey. She\u2019s so young and probably does miss Calla.  Is there a reason she doesn\u2019t want to visit her?", "NTA. From your edit I see you aren\u2019t even related to the other child.  Good luck and you are a good man stepping up for your sister!", "NTA. These people have some nerve calling you selfish for not wanting to parent a child at 19 when it\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t even want her themselves. It is a hard situation for the little girl but ultimately she would be better off with people neither too young or too old do care for her, that actually want her around. Tons of homes out there are willing to adopt kids 5 and under.", "NTA. A 19 year old guy is already taking guardianship of his 15 year old biological sister. He does not need to be responsible for a 5 year old step sister that barely knows him.", "Lacey is not your blood relative.  Her grandparents are not your blood relatives.  If they continue to harass you and stalk you in an attempt to give this child to you, consider sending them a legal letter requesting they stop contacting you and stop harassment of you.  This **is** harassment and you do not deserve this.", "NTA. While I understand grandparents concern, they have no right pressuring you into taking such a big responsibility. Taking care of a 15yo is totally different than a 5yo. \nWhile you have no obligation to do so, I would reconsider completely shutting little girl out of your life, since your father was her father figure as well (unless you didn't didn't get along with your father at all)", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA they should be ashamed of themselves for not offering to take all three of you in.

Putting aside the lack of familial relationship (blood and bond), taking in a 5 year old is very different from taking in a 15 year old. Your sister is at least three years away from finishing school and beginning her adult life. She doesn't need a babyditter/daycare, she can handle day activities in ger own, etc. Taking in the 5 year old would mean committing 13 years of your life to being a single parent. Send the in-laws a cease and desist letter. Warn them thst continued attempts to cotact you will result in you going to the police for harassment.", "NTA.

You are already taking on a lot.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your child or even your sister; therefore, not your responsibility.", "NTA.\nYou are 19 yourself your sister is independent in most of the things because she is a teen.

If you guys had all grown up together I would have a different opinion than the one I have.\n\nAs it is, you are 19 dealing with the loss of your father. This comes after your own mother passed away leaving you and your sister now without parents. It's a major expense to carry her on at such a young age. \n\nThe grandparents should be a lot more mature about this. Just because you're young doesn't mean you're the best choice.

There is huge difference between looking after a 15 year old and a 5 year old, even if they were both full siblings. You aren't technically related, and they require way more time and effort.

I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nHowever, I understand where Lacey's grandparents are coming from, they just lost their daughter and they may not feel prepared for raising a 5-year-old. They're grieving, overwhelmed, and probably just lashing out. They might be feeling their own mortality and the prospect of Lacey still having 13 years of childhood ahead of her. Life is shit sometimes. \n\nYou don't have a moral or legal responsibility to them, do what you need to do to get through and if that means ignoring them so be it. I do feel for the little girl and her grandparents, though.", "Definitely NTA. You have enough on your plate already, and well done for taking in your sister.   First of all the other child is not your sibling and most importantly, it's a 5 year old. Completely different kettle of fish.

Seeing as they have older grandkids that implies they have other children. \n\nLacey has actual aunts and uncles who could step up and raise her. \n\nYou, a 19 year old of no relation, are NOT responsible for her. You\u2019re pretty much still a child yourself, who\u2019s jumped headfirst into adulthood before you should have had to. \n\nTaking in your 15 year old sister is extremely different than raising a 6 year old. \n\nCalla will pretty much raise herself.

Agreeing to take care of someone for 3 years full time is a much smaller ask than for the next 13 years of your life which almost all of a child\u2019s formative years and 5 is wayyyyyyy more challenging when you\u2019re just barely a legal adult.", "NTA.

Our dad and his wife died three months ago. Mine and Calla's mom died when we were younger, dad and his wife had been married for 4 years. His wife had a 5 year old daughter Lacey. When CPS became involved because both were left orphan's, I stepped up to take my sister. I was already working full time since I skipped college and I just about had what I needed to take care of my sister. They asked me about Lacey and I told them I just wanted to take my sister.\n\nLacey was placed with her grandparents, my dad's ILs. They became aware of the fact Calla came to live with me and that I had been offered the chance to take their granddaughter and refused. Once they learned this they asked me why, and then pestered me about it for weeks. Finally they told me they were older and she could use as much family as possible and that she misses Calla (she wouldn't really remember me). I asked Calla if she wanted to see her and she said not really. So I told them we were not interested in staying in their granddaughter's life. They told me she's our little sister, that my dad would have wanted us to stick together. I told them I didn't care what my dad wanted. They said not to punish a child for the sins of my parent. I blocked them and continued on with things until they sought me out on social media via one of their older grandkids and told me that I should be ashamed of myself and their granddaughter deserves to be with her siblings and be raised by me since I'm young, fit and healthy and could run around after her like they can't, and will be around a lot longer than them. I replied once that their granddaughter is not my responsibility and that I wanted them to leave me and my sister alone, because we have no reason to be in touch ever again.\n\nThat wasn't the end and they called me selfish and cruel a few times via another account. So I had to set my account to private to stop them.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Taking care of a 15 year old is a huge responsibility already and you're only 19. You can be proud of yourself you're doing it.

They can fuck off.", "NTA the grandparents have other older grandkids they can take her. Not your responsibility. Well done on stepping up for your sister though and wishing you good fortune.", "NTA. For god's sake, you're 19!!! WTF are these grandparents smoking?? \n\nI'll cut them a little slack, because they're grieving (and seem to have forgotten that you're grieving as well,) but damn.

I assume she is 9 now? if she was 5 when your dad married her mom.\n\nyou ar NTA and as your sister who might have had most of a relationship also says no, that is to me what would matter most.

Kudos! Many biological parent's don't manage to respect their kids as much as you do your sister.

Her grandparents are just trying to shift responsibility to someone else as they are clearly finding it tough. But trying to guilt you over a child you are not responsible for is not the solution.

And States have different laws, but your dad and his wife were only married 4 years.

Springing 12+ years of parental responsibility on a 19 yr old who never signed up for the job is complete BS and those grand parents should be ashamed of themselves.

I can\u2019t imagine newly losing both parents and my siblings who have lost their parents and could understand how I feel don\u2019t want anything to do with me and don\u2019t even want to see me.

I get that you don't understand her behaviour.\n\nYour cold reaction is unnecessarily cruel to the girl.\n\nWe all get the detachment. That's not it. It's just that it looks like you two are protecting your hearts from anything related to her, so you don't end up liking and taking her in maybe?\n\nWrite her letters. Tell her about her mom, about your dad. That's all that is needed. Box some of their wedding pictures.\n\nThis is something you *can* do without taking responsibility.", "Again, I don't think that OP should have to adopt the 5 year old. Separate point is that it seems callous of the 15 year old to not want to see the child at all.

It was his step kid.", "Op IS his family. And the 5y.o isn't related to ops dad. It was his step daughter not his daughter. Her grandparents on her mom's side are the only ones who can step up, unless lacey has a father somewhere who wants her or his parents want her, but OP and his family have no relation to her.", "Because the girl isn't his daughter either", "I re-read it and now I see that. That means they should be responsible for her.", "I cannot believe the audacity of those grandparents trying to pawn off their grandchild to a *19 year old* former step sibling. Just no.

She\u2019s not your responsibility. But\u2026 (there\u2019s always one) maybe you could step back and think about this in a more detached sort of way.

Good grief leave this poor guy alone!", "Honest question.  Do you like everybody you meet?  NO exceptions?  You've never met anybody you didn't like?  You've never met anybody that you had no feelings (good or bad) for?  You've never met anybody who you totally forgot about half an hour later?  In the situation OP describes, the three kids were essentially roommates.  Some child you are not related to is living under the same roof.   Are you going to love that kid as a little sister?   If so, that's OK.  But how would you KNOW that will happen?  And if it doesn't happen, why would that be weird?  If anything, loving the kid as a sister might be LESS likely than not having any feelings at all.   You think it's sad.

It wouldn\u2019t be that hard to be around sparingly. I stand by what I said, to not do even this tiny amount makes OP an AH. You lack empathy and seem caught up on the step sibling thing, rather than the fact that they had known this 5 year old since birth.

But they keep trying to get me to do it for some reason.", "It costs $1000 a month to raise a child, every month.  Without spending a single penny on education.  There are no discounts for raising multiple children.  OP is on the hook to raise her younger bio sister already.  That is a huge burden in terms of time, energy and money.  But it can be justified, as they are biological sisters.\n\nSome totally unrelated older people want OP to adopt a young girl who she's not related to, and has no relationship with, and does not desire to have a relationship with.  \n\nIt is unreasonable (in the extreme) to expect OP to do that, as it's a huge responsibility, before we even talk about money.  But on that note, are YOU going to pay the $1000 a month in child support?  Because the state wouldn't go after any of the girl's bio relatives for that.  \n\nAnd I think it's a safe bet that a 19 year old doesn't have so much disposable income that an extra $1000 a month in expenses would hardly be noticed.", "It's just how things are.

What is more important is the parental figures and caregivers. Losing contact with a step they barely knew isn't going to be a factor in the child's wellbeing.\n\nThat the people who should be responsible, her actual family, keep trying to get rid of her is a big problem but it is not OPs problem.
