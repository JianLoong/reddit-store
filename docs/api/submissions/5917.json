Our dad and his wife died three months ago. Mine and Calla's mom died when we were younger, dad and his wife had been married for 4 years. His wife had a daughter, Lacey, who is now 5. When CPS became involved because both were left orphan's, I stepped up to take my sister. I was already working full time since I skipped college and I just about had what I needed to take care of my sister. They asked me about Lacey and I told them I just wanted to take my sister.\n\nLacey was placed with her grandparents, my dad's ILs. They became aware of the fact Calla came to live with me and that I had been offered the chance to take their granddaughter and refused. Once they learned this they asked me why, and then pestered me about it for weeks. Finally they told me they were older and she could use as much family as possible and that she misses Calla (she wouldn't really remember me). I asked Calla if she wanted to see her and she said not really. So I told them we were not interested in staying in their granddaughter's life. They told me she's our little sister, that my dad would have wanted us to stick together. I told them I didn't care what my dad wanted. They said not to punish a child for the sins of my parent. I blocked them and continued on with things until they sought me out on social media via one of their older grandkids and told me that I should be ashamed of myself and their granddaughter deserves to be with her siblings and be raised by me since I'm young, fit and healthy and could run around after her like they can't, and will be around a lot longer than them. I replied once that their granddaughter is not my responsibility and that I wanted them to leave me and my sister alone, because we have no reason to be in touch ever again.\n\nThat wasn't the end and they called me selfish and cruel a few times via another account. So I had to set my account to private to stop them.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: Making clear that Lacey was my dad's stepdaughter, not his daughter.\n\nETA2: I am a guy, not a girl. Just wanted to point that out because I have noticed a couple of people use the wrong pronouns for me and figured adding it here would help.\n\nETA3: Some info that keeps being asked. The bio dad is not on the scene. He could be dead but I really don't know. He never seemed to be in the picture though. He could also be unknown or something but there is no bio father involved. I also was not close to my dad. Neither was my sister. There was a lot of stuff involved there but I was no contact with him and everyone but my sister for more than a year before he and his wife died. So I had nothing to do with Lacey for more than a year.", "created_utc": 1672309171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy1zuf/aita_for_telling_my_late_dads_ils_that_their/", "score": 12339, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When my dad's ILs who took his stepdaughter after he and his wife died reached out to me a few times to get me and my sister in her life again and to have me raise her with my sister, I said no, and the last time I told them she was not my responsibility. The reason I ask the questions is I know from my sister that Lacey (dad's stepdaughter) was really fond of her, called her sister, loved her even though it was one sided and I can imagine that this has been extra tough on her because she lost.

They need to figure out how to provide care for their granddaughter.", "If I understand correctly Lacey was not your sibling, she was the daughter of your dads wife from an earlier marriage.\n\nWhy would you want to raise a kid that is not family?\n\nNTA", "You are 19 years old. Taking care of a 15 year old is a LOT different than raising a 5 year old. Sounds like Lacey isn\u2019t even related to you. NTA. Her relatives can work it out amongst themselves. Guilt tripping a 19 year old is beyond the pale.", "NTA. Your dad\u2019s in-laws are awful, trying to pressure you when you\u2019re 19, you\u2019ve just lost your father and you\u2019re already taking care of a 15yo. You\u2019re completely right, you\u2019re not responsible for the child and she\u2019s no longer any relation to you. You need to be able to get on with your life and taking care of someone else\u2018s 5yo would really restrict you.   \nStay strong and stand your ground. Best of luck.", "NTA. Lacey is not your responsibility.", "NTA.\n\nYou're a 19 year old guy and you've already stepped up to become a guardian for your younger sister. You've done a kind thing there.\n\nI feel super bad for little Lacey. She's an innocent little girl and she's lost both her parents (and, from her perspective, her big sister too) BUT, and it's a massive but, that little girl is not related to you and she's not your (or your sisters) responsibility.\n\nIf you did take her in, it would impact on your life and your sisters life greatly. It would be a lifelong responsibility to take on a little girl. Your sister is different. She's a blood relative and 15. She can look after herself to a certain extent and certainly doesn't need to be watched the same way a 5yo would.\n\nLacey's grandparents are massive AHs for trying to guilt you into taking Lacey in.\n\nMaybe one of the older grandkids could take her if they feel so strongly about this.\n\nOp, you are NTA. I'm glad you blocked her grandparents. I wish you and your sister all the best.\n\nEDITED to correct a mistake.", "Yeah NTA. An older sibling is fair enough. They are functional and just need a bit of big brother guidance through the next few years at most. Plus the odd kick up the arse when they think they're an adult. Aswell as yourself. At 19 is a hell of a responsibility to be taken on a 5 year while still just getting your foot out the door in the 'real' world.\nSorry the grandparents are inconvenienced by your decision but they would be in a better position to deal with a youngen full time. \nSorry for your loss may the grind of life be less barbaric than what you've already had to endure.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP! \n\nYou are absolutely NTA! They\u2019re just looking for someone to take care of her because kids are not easy to look after!", "NTA, you are young and you try your best to care for you sis, Lacey is not blood related and apart from that, asking a 19 year old to take on two kids is unreasonable.", "NTA. You mentioned Lacey\u2019s grandparents have older grandkids, so why can\u2019t any of the other kids/grandkids (who are actually related to Lacey) take her in. Wouldn\u2019t it be in her best interest to be surrounded by real family?", "Nta. Look i get it the kid is only 5 and it sucks for her. However its not ops fault. The fact that the grandparents are trying to put the burden of raising a child on a 19 year old is disgusting and disturbing. This doesnt even have do with family. There is a HUGE difference in raising, parenting, and financially supporting a 15 year old vs. A 5 year old. To tell op that this responsibility falls to him alone is b.s. and ridiculous to anyone with some common sense. Again it sucks for the kid but not at ops fault or his burden to bear.\n\nEdited to change where i called him a her, my bad.", "NTA. She's not your relative.", "NTA!!!!  They expected you to adopt a little girl who you were not related to.  And you said no.  And they did not respect that.  Wow.", "NTA - It\u2018s fantastic and an incredible achievement (at 19!!) that you are able and willing to provide for Calla. \n\nAs for your dad\u2019s IL, they simply just want to guilt trip you into caring for Lacey, so they don\u2019t have to and they can go back to the child-free freedom they had gotten used to.", "NTA.  Anyone pressuring you, and your first question should be why don\u2019t you do it?  Please block them on everything.  It sounds weird though, their daughter died and trying to get rid of a biological link to their daughter?  Now that is cold.", "NTA. It is tough enough for a 19-year-old to take care of himself (possibly juggling education and earning a living). It is even harder to take care of his 15-year-old sister. \n\nBut it is close to impossible to also take in a 5-year-old. It is very insensitive of the grandparents to even expect that if you'd be a full or half sibling. It is madness to expect it from an unrelated stranger.", "NTA kids are a huge responsibility. You are still young. Being burdened by a child to take care of has a huge impact on life. \nWhile some of the arguments on why the IL may not be a great choice are valid. It does not mean you have to take the load out care for it. \n\nIt's a shitty situation but you are not the AH.", "NTA. Caring for a 15 year old is very different from caring for a 5 year old. Where's Lacey's biodad and his family in all of this?\n\nI am curious, you were 15 when your dad married Lacey's mom. Were you kicked out? Why wouldn't Lacey remember you?", "Taking morals out for a second, and just taking the logistics of it into account, a 15 year old is a lot different than a 5 year old. You're 19, and working. You're not even established fully into the adult world yet, and already taking care of one child.\n\n That's a lot. And probably the only reason why you're able to  because at 15, most teens are fairly independent, and don't require much supervision. But a 5 year old needs constant supervision, and child care. The costs alone would hurt you tremendously. That issue isn't as much for a 15 year old.\n\nLogistically, taking care of a 15 year old is a lot easier than a 5 year old.\n\nMorally, you were always in the clear there. And I think you are a wonderful brother by taking care of your 15 year old sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you are doing great. Ignore them and focus on you and your sister. Hug!", "NTA. You were honest with them from the beginning and you\u2019re not obligated to take on additional responsibility that you don\u2019t want.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 19 taking care of your little sister. You both suffered major losses and taking care of a toddler shouldn't be out on you. I hope the best for you and your sis.", "NTA. And if they have other grandkids, aren\u2019t they or their parents (i.e., Lacey\u2019s aunts/uncles) better suited to take care of her? I just don\u2019t understand why they aren\u2019t looking closer to home for this.\n\nIn any case, looking after your 15 year old sister at 19 is one thing. Looking after a 5 year old that you barely know at 19 is something else. I cannot imagine that there aren\u2019t others in your stepmother\u2019s family who are in a better position for this.\n\nSo sorry for your loss, and best of luck to both of you.", "Jeeze.  All these people on here thinking you are TA astound me!  You\u2019re 19.  Your path for the next few years is to look after your sister and help her become a functional adult where, technically, you really shouldn\u2019t be a functioning adult yet\u2026 but you are.\n\nAfter you normalise life with your sister, focus back on your own life.  And no, your late father\u2019s step-daughter is not your responsibility.  You\u2019re just being an awesome older brother to your sister.  If you took in the 5-year old, you\u2019d have to be a dad.  Shame on the grandparents for not seeing that you\u2019re still a teenager!\n\nNTA x1000", "NTA. Sorry for your loss. It\u2019s awesome that you stepped up and took in your sister.", "NTA\n\nYou're so freaking young and already caring for your sibling. They shouldn't be even asking this of you. It's a *huge* commitment on every aspect of life. *Especially* due to the age difference. It's sound just like they wanna dodge their responsibility.\n\nETA: get in touch with CPS or any other authority to report their harassment if you need, you two already went through enough. It's not the kid's fault but you are right to preserve yourselves.", "NTA\n\nDocument everything - every attempt at contact, every new social media account created, every person they\u2019ve persuaded to reach out to you, every name they\u2019ve called you, every response you\u2019ve sent telling them to stop, LITERALLY EVERYTHING - and file for a protection (or intervention) order. They are harassing you and ignoring your requests to leave you alone and they need to stop.\n\nYou\u2019re wonderful for taking on the care of your sister. Good luck to your both. I hope your dad\u2019s ILs realise they need to let this go and be there for their granddaughter instead of focusing their unwanted (and hopefully soon illegal) attention and hate on you.", "Heavy on NTA. It would be nice if you did take Lacey however and I feel strongly on this .. it\u2019s not your responsibility either . YOURE ONLY 19 !. I\u2019m just not understanding what\u2019s not clicking to Lacey\u2019s family . They know just as much as I know it\u2019s a big difference taking care of a 15 y/o vs a 5 y/o\u2026 I get it the grandparents are old but your stepmom\u2019s family can step in way more and help the grandparents more if it\u2019s becoming to much on the grandparents instead of being childish making facebook post .", "NTA. You are just starting out in life and your sister deserves to have her own freedoms and time to deal with the loss in her own way.  Lacey isn't blood and while they may struggle,  it sounds like there are other family members capable of helping (i.e., older grandchildren who can navigate social media). It sucks for the 5yr old,  but you don't have any obligations and have every right to live your life.", "NTA. Your 19!!! You are already taking on way more than normal for someone your age.", "NTA it's not your responsibility. The other one wasn't your responsibility either so good on you for taking her in. Where is this girl's dad?", "NTA you are not responsible for a step sibling. The child\u2019s maternal and paternal family are. Sounds like she does have other blood relatives who are quick to criticize you but not step up. Keep blocking them this is not your responsibility. Good luck to you both.", "Nra!!  This is perplexing - why are they balking at raising their late daughter's kid ?and pushing so hard?", "It is unreasonable to assume you, at age 19, are willing to take on the care of a child who is not related to you or your sister.  The child has been placed with her own relatives, if they don't want to take care of her, that's their problem, not yours.  \n\nThey are selfish and cruel for their rejection of the child.  No doubt they offered no incentive or financial help to take her on.\n\nAlso I doubt a 15 year old and 5 year old have much in common, even if they were being raised as 'sisters'.  \n\nIt is possible you or your sister might might be entitled to some support for college or other things.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but I would consider consulting with a lawyer and having them draft a cease and desist letter to not contact you or your sister again.", "You are not related and have nothing to do with the 5 year old, they are TA and are just trying to get rid of her. they also have other grandchildren who are older, they can take care of her as they are actually related. Tell them to go f themselves and document all their abuse incase you need to get restraining orders.", "NTA. Her grandparents doesn't wanna take responsibility of her so they're dumping her on OP, which is pretty sad for Lacey since she's innocent in all this. OP is already doing a great job by taking in his sister. If OP was not in the picture or not capable of taking care of Calla, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't do sh-t for Calla.", "NTA, but I do feel sorry for Lacey. She\u2019s so young and probably does miss Calla.  Is there a reason she doesn\u2019t want to visit her?", "NTA. From your edit I see you aren\u2019t even related to the other child.  Good luck and you are a good man stepping up for your sister!", "NTA. These people have some nerve calling you selfish for not wanting to parent a child at 19 when it\u2019s clear that they don\u2019t even want her themselves. It is a hard situation for the little girl but ultimately she would be better off with people neither too young or too old do care for her, that actually want her around. Tons of homes out there are willing to adopt kids 5 and under.", "NTA. A 19 year old guy is already taking guardianship of his 15 year old biological sister. He does not need to be responsible for a 5 year old step sister that barely knows him.", "Lacey is not your blood relative.  Her grandparents are not your blood relatives.  If they continue to harass you and stalk you in an attempt to give this child to you, consider sending them a legal letter requesting they stop contacting you and stop harassment of you.  This **is** harassment and you do not deserve this.", "NTA. While I understand grandparents concern, they have no right pressuring you into taking such a big responsibility. Taking care of a 15yo is totally different than a 5yo. \nWhile you have no obligation to do so, I would reconsider completely shutting little girl out of your life, since your father was her father figure as well (unless you didn't didn't get along with your father at all)", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA they should be ashamed of themselves for not offering to take all three of you in.

A 15 year old can be trusted to cook for herself and be able to be alone but not a 5 year old. You\u2019d need to find babysitters and the cost and commitment needed to take her in are far more than your sister. It is an unfair expectation for anyone, let alone you who is only 19 yourself", "They're out of their mind, to begin with you only have a responsibility towards your sister. And lucky for you she's 15 and can pretty much take care of herself.

Putting aside the lack of familial relationship (blood and bond), taking in a 5 year old is very different from taking in a 15 year old. Your sister is at least three years away from finishing school and beginning her adult life. She doesn't need a babyditter/daycare, she can handle day activities in ger own, etc. Taking in the 5 year old would mean committing 13 years of your life to being a single parent. Send the in-laws a cease and desist letter. Warn them thst continued attempts to cotact you will result in you going to the police for harassment.", "NTA. It's sad, but it wouldn't benefit this child to be with someone she doesn't know. This is why people should establish guardianships just in case something happens to them.", "NTA no blood relation, there isn\u2019t anything linking you genetically to her", "Taking care of a 14 year old and taking care of a 5 year old are completely different things. You\u2019re so young and taking on that responsibility would be world changing. NTA AT ALL", "NTA, block them all. They wanted you to take care of the toddler so that they don't have too. The cousin was worried the toddler may become his responsibility when the grandparents passed.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to look after your dads stepdaughter.

You have enough on your plate. Hell I\u2019m 37 and a single father and still struggle with it from time to time.\nKeep up the good work.", "NTA. She is not your responsibility. You are already taking on a lot.", "NTA. She\u2019s not your child or even your sister; therefore, not your responsibility.", "NTA.\nYou are 19 yourself your sister is independent in most of the things because she is a teen.

They have to find a solution, like hire a babysitter or involving other family members.", "While it's extremely heartbreaking and unfortunate Lacey lost her mom and wants be around Calla, it really isn't your responsibility to take care of her seeing as you guys haven't fostered a close relationship and that she's not your blood relation. If you guys had all grown up together I would have a different opinion than the one I have.\n\nAs it is, you are 19 dealing with the loss of your father. This comes after your own mother passed away leaving you and your sister now without parents. It's a major expense to carry her on at such a young age. \n\nThe grandparents should be a lot more mature about this. Just because you're young doesn't mean you're the best choice. You also need to have the ability to raise her as well.

There is huge difference between looking after a 15 year old and a 5 year old, even if they were both full siblings. You aren't technically related, and they require way more time and effort.

I hope the grandparents get her into therapy.", "NTA, you are already doing more than most 19-year-olds with your sister and that's more than enough. Good on you for stepping up. I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nHowever, I understand where Lacey's grandparents are coming from, they just lost their daughter and they may not feel prepared for raising a 5-year-old. They're grieving, overwhelmed, and probably just lashing out. They might be feeling their own mortality and the prospect of Lacey still having 13 years of childhood ahead of her. Life is shit sometimes. \n\nYou don't have a moral or legal responsibility to them, do what you need to do to get through and if that means ignoring them so be it. I do feel for the little girl and her grandparents, though.", "Definitely NTA. You have enough on your plate already, and well done for taking in your sister.   First of all the other child is not your sibling and most importantly, it's a 5 year old. Completely different kettle of fish.

Seeing as they have older grandkids that implies they have other children. \n\nLacey has actual aunts and uncles who could step up and raise her. \n\nYou, a 19 year old of no relation, are NOT responsible for her. You\u2019re pretty much still a child yourself, who\u2019s jumped headfirst into adulthood before you should have had to. \n\nTaking in your 15 year old sister is extremely different than raising a 6 year old. \n\nCalla will pretty much raise herself. She can work with you to take care of the home and she will be joining the workforce in a few years too. She will need your guidance and support, but you won\u2019t need to parent her too much. Hopefully Calla has a good head on her shoulders and that she avoids getting herself into trouble - you might want to see if she wants to go on birth control soon and I\u2019m sure that will be an uncomfortable conversation,  but will hopefully be the most parent-like you\u2019ll need to be. \n\nLacey on the other hand needs a full-time parent figure. It\u2019s absolutely cruel to try and force that role into you when you\u2019ve only JUST started your life (no one has their shit totally together when they just start out, and that\u2019s ok!) \n\nTaking in your sister was kind and loving. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility and it\u2019s honourable of you to do that. \n\nLacey\u2019s grandparents can manage her or rely on their actual family for support.

Agreeing to take care of someone for 3 years full time is a much smaller ask than for the next 13 years of your life which almost all of a child\u2019s formative years and 5 is wayyyyyyy more challenging when you\u2019re just barely a legal adult.", "NTA.

Our dad and his wife died three months ago. Mine and Calla's mom died when we were younger, dad and his wife had been married for 4 years. His wife had a 5 year old daughter Lacey. When CPS became involved because both were left orphan's, I stepped up to take my sister. I was already working full time since I skipped college and I just about had what I needed to take care of my sister. They asked me about Lacey and I told them I just wanted to take my sister.\n\nLacey was placed with her grandparents, my dad's ILs. They became aware of the fact Calla came to live with me and that I had been offered the chance to take their granddaughter and refused. Once they learned this they asked me why, and then pestered me about it for weeks. Finally they told me they were older and she could use as much family as possible and that she misses Calla (she wouldn't really remember me). I asked Calla if she wanted to see her and she said not really. So I told them we were not interested in staying in their granddaughter's life. They told me she's our little sister, that my dad would have wanted us to stick together. I told them I didn't care what my dad wanted. They said not to punish a child for the sins of my parent. I blocked them and continued on with things until they sought me out on social media via one of their older grandkids and told me that I should be ashamed of myself and their granddaughter deserves to be with her siblings and be raised by me since I'm young, fit and healthy and could run around after her like they can't, and will be around a lot longer than them. I replied once that their granddaughter is not my responsibility and that I wanted them to leave me and my sister alone, because we have no reason to be in touch ever again.\n\nThat wasn't the end and they called me selfish and cruel a few times via another account. So I had to set my account to private to stop them.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Are the grandparents willing to pay you handsomely, or would you gain any of the insurance money from the girls mothers death to pay for her upkeep?  Furthermore, how would the grandparents feel if you moved away for work, taking their grand daughter with them and they lost contact with her?  That would get very, very messy.\n\nWould your decision change if Lacey came to live with you along with the life insurance and a regular payment from the grandparents to cover cost of living and housing?

First off, there is a big difference between taking care of a 15 year old and a 5 year old. The level of commitment, responsibility, and financial hardships are vastly different.

She is likely able to fend for herself meal wise so long as you ensure there is food in the house. \n\nMy own 15 year old is responsible for their own laundry, making small meals for themself when I'm at work (12 hour shifts where it's well past dinner when I get home.) And some minor household chores. Things kids pf this age need to know how to handle because they are only steps away from potentially leaving the nest.\n\nThat 5 year old will require much more supervision. Daycare costs for when there's no school but you still have work. And that's a HUGE cost let me tell you. Could be more than half your paycheck depending on amount of hours needed. And you'll have to work to support those kids.\n\nNo. You're NTA and your father's inlaws don't give a rats ass about how you and your sister would fare in life.\n\nIn the end though it would have been nice if the 5 year old could have had visitation with the girl they bonded with as a sister.

Lacey needs a stable family life, they know how that should look better than a 19yo (you\u2019d think anyway).

I know you're an adult but you're only 19, and to have both your parents pass and be the sole guardian of your younger sibling is heartbreaking. I hope you have a good support network of friends and hopefully other family (ideally adults over 25yo) to offer help and support. I'm so sorry that you're having to go through all of this and not even being able to grieve properly due to the bombardment of harassing messages from these people. \n\nYour dad and stepmother should have had a plan in place for guardianship for Lacey. You shouldn't even have to have the responsibility of your sister, let alone a sibling you're not related to. If the in-laws really cared about 'family', they'd be offering you help and support with Calla and for yourself since according to their logic, you should be their family too. If they're not fit to care for a 4yo and no other family wishes to step up, then she'll become an orphan to the state. It's an awful thought but it's not on you. That's their decision and their business as her guardians now. \n\nIf you have the time, I'd seek out legal advice with regards to Calla and mention the harassment from your dad's in-laws. It wouldn't do much about the harassment, but it would start a record in the event you need it further down the line. \n\nAgain, I'm so sorry for your loss and this hardship you've got to deal with.

Good for you for standing up for yourself and your sister.", "OP is NTA. He's doing the right thing by taking in his 15 year-old sister; but asking a 19 year-old to become a single parent to a 5 year-old is unreasonable. With that said, however, I am troubled by how indifferent & uncompassionate both OP & his sister sound regarding the little girl's situation. No, she's not their responsibility or blood relative, but jeez, show a little kindness! To just cut her off completely -- no contact, no phone calls, letters, or visits -- is heartless & cruel. That poor little girl has just lost her parents, and now someone she regards and probably loves as her big sister has also totally disappeared from her life. That's traumatizing for a young child; she's going to have major abandonment issues when she grows up.", "You are NTA for only taking your sister. Taking care of a sibling it a lot of responsibility and recognizing you don\u2019t want to/aren\u2019t able to also care for a 5 year old is good.

Sometimes you gotta be an asshole to take care of yourself and what's important in your life, which is your sister. \n\nIMO, which is worth jackshit, you did the correct move. You're 19, and attempted saddling a young adult who is newly navigating adult life with a 5yr old child is a chicken shit plea.

Did you establish a good rapport with anyone in CPS? I wonder if it would help to contact them and let them know about all the pressure you are receiving as well as giving them the names of all of Lacey's other family members who are not stepping up to the plate. \n\nOr perhaps you can try and find a sliding scale legal aid service in your area.

He's already a saint for taking her in.

OP, don't feel bad at all.  19 years old and looking after your own sister is extremely noble.  I wish you both the absolute best, you're doing a very good thing and deserve massive props for it.\n\nI'm going to guess it's also a million times easier for a 19 year old to look after a 15 year old (that's also lost her parents) then it is to look after a 5yo.  The 15 year old is pushing adult years (the maturity that's been thrust upon her is almost as much as what's been put upon you, and being pushed into parenthood at 19, without any possible parental support, is about as big as it gets) so your sister can probably look after herself somewhat, with some brotherly support.  A 5yo can't look after herself at all.", "Grandparents and other adults related by blood who would rather force a 5yo on to someone who doesnt want to have to look after them than to take care of her themselves.

Im suspecting there is something we dony know about in all this.

I understand the child is upset by all the events but no, she's not your responsibility. She has family on her mothers side obviously since they have other grandchildren.

Clearly they have younger relatives to take her since they\u2019re using them to harass you on social media. \nAs a mom, this breaks my heart for that little girl. She deserves someone. But that should be her actual family. Not two grieving teenagers. Also, i would never want my kid stuck with someone who doesn\u2019t want them, doesn\u2019t love them, and isn\u2019t prepared to care for them. You are absolutely not in the wrong here. I am truly sad for that little girl, 4 years will mean a lot more to her than it will for your sister. She\u2019s lost her whole family, it\u2019s truly a tragic situation.

Taking care of your sister alone is an awful lot of responsibility and you are an amazing person for doing this.\n\nWhen I first started reading this, I was thinking something along the lines of \"well, he could maybe spend some time with the younger child, he doesn't have to cut her off completely, she just lost her parents, let her keep at least some family.\"  However, after reading about the actions of her grandparents and other relatives, I'm thinking that would be a horrible idea.  If you were to start spending time with her, they would constantly be angling for you to take custody.  It would very well be possible that they would simply ditch her with you and be nowhere to be found.  Cutting ties seems to be the correct thing to do in this situation.", "NTA.  \n\n\nNot your blood relative, not your responsibility.

Your sister is nearly an adult herself, but Lacey is a young child. Raising a child is a huge responsibility, and it should be up to you too determine if that's something you're ready for, or if you even want to do it. If you had decided to take Lacey in, that would be extremely admirable, but that doesn't mean you're an asshole for not doing it.", "NTA.  There may have been a more tactful way to explain that you are a 19 year old (practically a kid but I can tell you're very mature and I myself was orphaned at 19) and you're already at your limit for what you can provide for a safe and healthy home to yourself and your sister, but you have no obligation to step in for this 5 year old's care.  There's a reason most kids who have a baby at 15 still live with their families at your age, because being 19 and having a barely school-aged child, acting as a single parent, is not healthy or realistic.  Other family of your step-mom's kid can step up if the grandparents are too old or unable.  Are there no aunts or uncles of your step-mom's?  Why are they looking to YOU to step up?  And maybe it's just me, but I feel like the onus is on the parents to consider certain things like, \"What would happen to our kids if we both died suddenly?\" before it actually happens and to make plans.  I get this has upset her grandparents' presumed retirement or lives, and they've already lost their daughter which is in and of itself very sad for them, but it's unfair and unrealistic to expect a non-relative to assume the role of caretaker for a child when you're just getting onto your feet.  Your sister is old enough that soon she'll be able to bring in her own income and start developing adult skills to take care of herself (if she isn't already), and she doesn't need a babysitter and constant never-ceasing-supervision because she's already older. \n\nHowever, while your sister may not really be interested in a relationship with this 5 year old, that same 5 year old just lost both of her parents (essentially, as she was a baby when your dad married her mother and he's the only father she would have ever known) and she's already going through a great deal.  Your sister is also the only sister she has ever known, so I feel the worst for this little girl caught in the middle between losing the 3 family members she was the most familiar with (parents and sister), and 2 grandparents who don't want to raise her.  That poor kid can probably sense that they don't want to take care of her, and kids are so much smarter than we give them credit for. \n\nI wish you nothing but the best.  This is a shitty situation to navigate, but you're NTA for trying to live within your means.", "You are so much NTA you are opposite you are a stand up man and a hero to your sister .  You are taking on way more responsibility than most men your age would even consider .  It has to be tough and your efforts are to be commended .\nNot only that , for your fathers in-laws to be pursuing you and calling you names and trying to saddle you with a 5 year old girl after you just lost your parents is crazy.  They are trying to give you their responsibility .  \nYour 5 year old sister is important and she does need a place to live with people who are able to love and care for her .  But that\u2019s THEIR RESPONSIBILITY and obligation to find her that family is absolutely in no way not yours.  There are plenty of agency and outreach programs they could contact before beating you up at 19 over it when you are already accomplishing SO MUCH. Best Wishes to you !", "NTA.  Legally, you have zero connection/ responsibility.  There should have been life insurance ( Mom\u2019s) to cover any financial burden, plus as a minor, she gets social security.  \n\nAs for the age thing.. just as gram and gramps are too old, step brother is too young.", "NTA\n\nYou have no legal ties or obligations to Lacey.\n\nMaybe they should work on trying to find the father or someone else who's actually related to her to raise her.", "NTA. You are caring for your family and they can figure out how to care for theirs.", "The honest answer is that no one wants to raise the kid. Raising a 5 year old is a lot of work and the grandparents are trying to stick someone with the responsibility. If they're her only family maybe adoption would be the best option", "Make sure that you look into whatever social security benefits are available to support your sister.  I don't personally know what else would be but it's worth a look.", "NTA - First you are 19. Hats off to you for stepping to take care of your 15 year old sister. I think you are too young to put that kind of responsibility on. The fact you chose to do it, you have my genuine respect.\n\nSecond: the step sister is 5. Taking care of a 5 year old vs a 15 year old is several times more work and kids that age require pretty much constant supervision. If you have to go to work or any where else for that matter who will watch her? Day care costs are astronomical and probably more than the total income of a 19 year old.\n\nNext problem is the duration of the commitment. Unlike your sister who is already old enough to be left unsupervised and can even start working legally(16 in my state) and start building her own life rather than being fully dependent on you. the step sister will need to depend on who ever is taking care of her for 10+ years. \n\nOther than the time/money responsibilities don\u2019t forget this will disrupt your livelihood as a young adult. Lets say you meet the love of your life tomorrow and she is excited to go on dates with you. But you cant because you only have 3 specific time slots in the next month and those don\u2019t work for her. Dates get postponed, she meets someone else and becomes your \u201cthe one that got away\u201d. Some part of you will resent the step sister for it and that will lead to problems down the line. \n\nThe former step-sisters grandparents are in a tough situation, frustrated and trying to latch onto your future as a way to lessen their burdens. We see this pattern often where people that are generally considered good people are targeted aggressively for their good will. I would put on a mean face, push back and get intimidating yo drive them away so you can move on with your life. Quite frankly that girl is not your family, she was a step sister through someone that is now deceased. I think its safe ti say any familial obligation and courtesies are also dead.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you want to go to college. But i started at age 23 in an accelerated program for bachelor\u2019s degree. Starting late I had an advantage my 18 year old classmates didn\u2019t, which was perspective. While they were trying to find shortcuts to pass classes. I was networking with professors, graduate students and going out of my way to learn how to set myself up for success after graduating. I turned down all the jobs the career councilors tried to set me up with in favor of one i found through the networking I did which paid 70% more. I was one of the very few actually making more money than they forecasted for their graduates and switched fields down with other skills I learned on the job for even more money. Meanwhile many of my classmates are working jobs like retail and never even got opportunity to use their degrees. Because they took it for granted while earning it and at the end it was nothing more than just a piece of paper. \n\nTLDR: you are NTA, focus on helping your sister get her life started as an upcoming alert and focus on your futures.", "NTA neither of you are related to her and it doesn't seem like your sister even likes her.

Anyway, NTA.", "INFO.\n\nBased on the basic facts of the story and the question of whether he's obligated to adopt his step-sister, op is Not The Asshole \u2014 it's entirely unreasonable of his step-grandparents to expect him to do so. The main reason for this is age: taking care of a 15-year old is very different from taking care of a 5-year old; it's totally understandable that a 19-year-old would feel able to undertake the one but not the other. Furthermore, Calla (15) has been living with her brother most of her life, so it's entirely sensible that they would move back in together to bridge the small number of years until she's ready for adulthood herself. That obviously doesn't apply to Lacey (5). The step-grandparents are definitely in the wrong.\n\nSo if this story rested purely on the question in the title and the bare facts of the case, that would be my judgement. However, I have some additional concerns: the first is that in his story OP doesn't even mention my arguments above about the the kids' respective ages; he exclusively leans on blood ties to make his case, which are much less convincing grounds. Obviously it's his choice whether to take responsibility for a child of any age and he's within his rights to prioritize his blood relations when doing so; but he'll get less sympathy from me if that's more important to him than, say, years spent living together. And given his tone throughout, it sounds like things may be 'personal' with him \u2014 it sounds like he may have unrelated resentment towards his stepmother and her family and that that may be showing through his story. If so, he has my sympathy; but ultimately speaking what matters here is what's best for the 5-year-old, and he shouldn't forget that crucial point to indulge in old grudges. \n\nSecondly, I'm perplexed by the question of visiting. As I read OP's story, it sounds like he's not only rejected adopting Lacey, he's also rejected plans to stay in touch with her \u2014 and that really gives me concern. I can see no reason for Calla and Lacey not to see one another often; Calla has been Lacey's big sister for all of her five years on earth, and there's no reason for her to suddenly disappear. So if OP really is blocking these social visits, he definitely is an asshole \u2014 and, moreover, given how little information we're given on this question I have to wonder if we're being told the whole story.\n\nI entirely support OP saying 'no' to his step-grandparents, and he's not an asshole for doing so \u2014 but there are different ways of saying 'no', and I have to wonder if he's said it in an asshole-like manner. Obviously we aren't privy to the actual communications involved, so we have to guess; and the troubling hints I've noticed in OP's story make me wonder whether he's fanned the flames with his step-grandparents rather than working constructively with them.", "NTA but ask Calla again if she wants to visit her baby sister sometime without having to take care of her forever.\n\nIf Lacey\u2019s grandparents wanted to maintain a relationship between Lacey and Calla, and were sad that you (a barely-legal adult who has NO parenting experience) wouldn\u2019t come to them for help and holidays, that\u2019s not an AH move.

A 5 year old isn't a 2 year old either, it's not exactly the 24/7 intense job of needing to make sure they are still alive at every moment, but it's still a huge and very hands on commitment. They're also by and large still too young to have any interests an average adult would share with the single possible exception of baking, so most of what you end up doing with them during all the hours they can't be left alone is boring as all get out.

They can be left alone, in most places legally even overnight or for a weekend if necessary (though whether that is advisable will vary). They can be reasonably expected to share fairly in the household chores, including the more major ones and cooking. They can and would often prefer to entertain themselves for long periods of time or even whole days. They will often share at least some interests with the adults around them. They can discuss things rationally and clearly present their opinions; they can understand no and rules even if they do not like them.   \n\n\nAgain I don't mean parenting a teen is easy.

If it's nominally full-day, what are the hours?  If Calla's school is from 8:00 - 4:30 and Lacey's kindergarten is from 9:00 - 3:00, who gets Lacey to school and gets her home?  If Lacey gets sick, who takes care of her during the day when Calla should be in school?  And who cares for her in the evening, when Calla should be doing her own homework?\n\nThis is a sad, bad situation, and OP and Calla aren't being jerks by recognizing the limits of what they can do.", "This. The only assholes in this situation are the grandparents. OP is amazing for taking in a 15 year old at the young age he is. But I do feel bad for the 5 year old. From her perspective, she lost her parents and her sister. She has no concept of blood relative or not, simply that she was raised with the 15yo as a sister, and the stepfather as a father. It would be nice for them to stay in her life, perhaps help her with the grieving process. But it does not at all mean that OP ought to be guilted into taking her in too.", "An unrelated, himself orphaned 19 year old man who hasn't met or talked to the granddaughter, her parents or said grandparents for well over a year, clearly disliked at least the father and already refused once.\n\nAt that point, why not hand your granddaughter to some stranger on the street?", "Dad blew a lot of money.

Also, in my state at least, whoever takes the child can get kinship funds to help take care of the child.", "Right like they just don\u2019t want to be interim kinship care, they\u2019ve adopted the child. They do not want to go to CPS and rescind to make her available for adoption because they don\u2019t want her going to strangers, but strangers who want a 5-year-old are far better than family who doesn\u2019t.

That will help you financially support her since I assume you weren't planning on taking care of someone else just yet.
