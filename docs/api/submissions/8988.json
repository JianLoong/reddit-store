Wtf kind of reaction is that?? Huge red flag. Worst case scenario, you just wash your daughter\u2019s hair and the oil will be gone. She ruined a very sweet cultural connection moment between you and your daughter. Not only is she setting a bad example by immediately losing her cool, but she sounds generally very culturally insensitive. If she\u2019s that worried about oil messing up her hair, shampoo and water exists for a reason.", "\"trying weird remedies\"\n\nWe've been doing this for centuries but alright.\n\nYou are NTA.

Does she go off like that only when the child is present?", "Oh wow, OP. You are certainly NTA. \n\nI'm really white and I'm so glad that friends have taught me about massaging coconut oil into my hair. This is not a weird remedy at all, but hair magic. What a wonderful father you are, to teach your daughter to care for her hair and scalp, and what a wonderful example of masculinity you are setting for her, that this is something that people do, not just women. \n\nI'm also a little red flag-alert about the \"greasy and disgusting comment\" because that smacks of racism, and I'd hate for your half-Indian daughter to grow up hearing things like that from her own mother. I'm also sad for you, hearing that from your wife. \n\nI hope that your wife is willing to learn and change -- people do! Maybe the three of you can do a coconut oil treatment together someday soon. There are plenty of YouTube videos about the magic of coconut oil for all types of hair. Maybe start there?", "NTA.\nYour wife's reaction was way over the top.

It\u2019s well known that south Asians put oil in their hair \u2013 my mum does it and used to do it for me as a kid and honestly, I thank my lucky stars every day because my hair is LUSHHHH let me tell ya. \n\nI\u2019d explain this to your wife, it\u2019s bigoted as hell to imply a simple cultural practise (which genuinely does help hair growth and thickness) is a \u2018weird remedy\u2019 or disgusting etc. Is she white? Do you go off if she feeds your kid a burger or something because it\u2019s not YOUR culture? NTA but your wife sure sounds like one.\n\nETA I\u2019d also suggest sitting down with your wife and explaining why these cultural practises are important to you, and why it\u2019s also important to not alienate your daughter from a part of herself that she might later be ashamed of or look down on because your wife \u2018others\u2019 it.", "NTA.

NTA obv", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is a huge AH and needs to realize that your child is multi-racial. Children usually become darker with age, so you need to get your wife to learn to accept that.\n\nAlso, those of us from closer to the Indus River use olive oil. Maybe try that and see what your racist wife thinks :).", "NTA, your wife is a grade A asshole!", "NTA. Your wife sounds close minded. Also it's not the end of the world, the oil washes out...why did she react like that lol.", "NTA- this was a bizarre, uncalled for and vaguely racist reaction on your wife's part. It wasn't meant to be any sort of remedy, just a tradition! You weren't trying to play doctor for a serious problem. I myself use coconut oil in my beauty routine all the time (it's great for calluses and an intense post waxing lotion). Coconut oil doesn't work for all hair types, but the kid is 5. Nobody is trying to make her a hair model, she just wanted some daddy daughter time. I'm sure if something happened, like actual hair damage or god forbid a nut allergy you would've stopped.\n\nAlso OP, what does your wife think is in conditioner, because some form of oil is in pretty much all of them. You rinse it out, your hair is soft and shiny and nobody bats an eye", "you are most definitely NTA as everyone has already expounded on here but as a former little indian girl it is just really delightful you shared this with your daughter. keep doing stuff like that. \n\nalso like, sephora all the way to the really expensive fancy beauty places have lots of coconut oil hair products that many, many white people use (and pay so much money for). i feel bad for your wife's hair tbh", "NTA. You married a racist.", "She said since my daughter is part white, the things that work on Indian hair won't work on her hair.", "Bro. Racist white chicks are often super attractive tho. And they have a kink for dark guys.", "Depending on your hair texture, sure different strokes.\n\nBut coconut oil is pretty well-regarded for most hair types and if your daughter has wavy, course hair or hair that is prone to frizziness or dries out quickly, coconut oil lathers would come up a treat for her.", "Ummm white woman here (blonde hair) - I mix coconut and avocado oils together with honey and put it in my hair once a week for 2-3 hours before washing - I've been told I have beautiful hair.", "It\u2019s totally possible it wouldn\u2019t. But also possible it might! But her calling your tradition weird is not okay", "Tons of white women use oil in their hair (I'm a natural blonde with waist length hair and use castor oil biweekly), but I'm not sure why she's assuming that your daughter's hair is automatically \"white\" hair when your daughter is also half Indian. \n\nAnd honestly, even if her hair was a bit oily after because the oil you used didn't end up being right for her hair type who cares? She was getting to share some bonding time she was excited about with her dad, that part is really the bigger thing hair than how her hair ended up looking. I remember my mom letting me use her mask (for fine lines and aging skin) with her when I was little to have a mini \"spa day\". I'm pretty sure an anti-aging mask didn't do a whole lot for my skin at 10, but I definitely loved getting to have the special time with my mom.", "I put coconut oil on my hair all the time. I\u2019m a redhead so purty white.\nI also was a stylist, if that counts.\nI also use jojoba, and rosemary oil. Jojoba is the easiest to apply. I would do it on a weekend, so it can absorb over night and wash it in the morning. Sometimes I use a wrap to hold the heat in.\n\nIt kinda doesn\u2019t seem about the hair, but maybe she is being possessive about their daughter?\nDoes she get much positive feedback in other areas of her life?", "On the contrary it works for a lot of white people hair! It\u2019s all about texture and it won\u2019t hurt her to try .", "Not necessarily. I have curly hair prone to frizz and coconut isn't great for it.", "Indian hair is basically the same as European, texture wise. It\u2019s why Indian hair is in demand for wig making.", "Omg- the skin I had at 10.\nThat sounds like a nice time w your mom.", "Would you mind discussing how you use the castor oil? I\u2019m needing to shift something with my hair, and I\u2019d love to know more!", "Like I said, different strokes. \n\nI also have curly hair that loses moisture fast and once a month coconut oil masks don't have any adverse effects on my mane."]}
