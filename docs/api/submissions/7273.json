Low levels of mold and radon now do not mean a basement is a great place for a bedroom. I\u2019ve worked in property management for a while. Doesn\u2019t matter if that house is a brand new build with a walkout basement patio or a 1970 build with a basement den. The reality is, basements are susceptible to flooding and water damage. Why would you want a child to contend with any possible water or mold damage? I\u2019d rather your Christmas decor be stored down there than a human being, wouldn\u2019t you agree? \n\n2. Also, basements inherently have a different temperature. Basements are colder and dimmer. I don\u2019t doubt that sleeping in what equates to essentially a storage area is going to mess up anyone\u2019s sleep quality. \n\n3. Finally, why would you want your child on a completely different level of the house as compared to you and your spouse? There\u2019s a reason bedrooms are often clustered together: so you can get your kids and get out. \n\nIn the case of intrusion or fire are you going to assume that A. You can access the basement in a timely manner to get you child or B. That your child will automatically know what to do? Look up the statistics on children who hide from fires instead of escape. \n\nWouldn\u2019t a basement with supposed easy exits also mean easy entrances? If I was thinking like a thief, I\u2019d go in through the basement. Do you want your child to be the first person they run into? \n\nFor my own peace of mind, I don\u2019t even allow my pets to sleep much further away from me than in my room or directly outside my room.

It\u2019s also how my friends and I would break in/out of each others homes for late night shenanigans. \n\nHint: basement windows can be very easy to break into if you\u2019re slender enough to fit. First home improvement I did when I moved into my own house and could afford it was replace all the windows with block glass", "I mean he\u2019s right she wouldn\u2019t appreciate the view, and he said they\u2019re the same distance", "Damn, he really did.

OP is only concerned about his view of the lake, not his child.\n\nI'll acknowledge my comment was an exaggeration.

My older two kids are on the ground floor and my 4yr old and the master are in the two bedrooms upstairs.

I loved Room!", "This is resolved with babyproofing, working alarms in sleeping spaces/attic/basement/crawlspace/etc, a gate, and a legal bedroom with outside access. The reality is that a fire can happen at any point in time and you are not always going to be on the same level as your kid. You may even be working in the yard with the baby monitor while your kid naps. I *personally* would prefer the same level but houses come in all kinds of configurations and people use spaces differently so it\u2019s not always possible.", "When I say upstairs I meant the first floor.

Thankfully we are transitioning her to a regular bed this week. But it was like we gave birth to Spider-Man lol. She was pulling to stand at the age of 6 months and then walking unassisted at the age of 9 months lol. I think by the time she was a year and a half she would just hurl her body over the crib and we had no other way of keeping her safe. We tried doing an open crib so she could get in and out safely. She would only sleep on the floor.. okay fine. But then she started freaking out and just screaming so we settled on use of the tent crib. Here\u2019s to hoping the next one doesn\u2019t have the same problem."]}
