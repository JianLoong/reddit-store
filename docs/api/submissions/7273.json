They even have the same number of stairs.  \n\nedit3: The basement is safe, lots of exits at ground level, low radon levels, no mold or dampness, electric furnace (not gas or oil). If anything it's safer than my office which is up stairs.\n\nedit4: please stop assuming and ask for INFO. I would obviously never put my daughter in danger. I would finish the basement before I put her down there. And radon is a concern which is why we had it tested, had mitigation installed, and continue to test.

There was one short period of time where he was waking up a lot at night and getting out of bed (around 3yo), and that would have been annoying to deal with walking up and down stairs, but honestly - that\u2019s not a reason not to organize your home the way that makes most sense overall!", "NTA.

Low levels of mold and radon now do not mean a basement is a great place for a bedroom. I\u2019ve worked in property management for a while. Doesn\u2019t matter if that house is a brand new build with a walkout basement patio or a 1970 build with a basement den. The reality is, basements are susceptible to flooding and water damage. Why would you want a child to contend with any possible water or mold damage? I\u2019d rather your Christmas decor be stored down there than a human being, wouldn\u2019t you agree? \n\n2. Also, basements inherently have a different temperature. Basements are colder and dimmer. I don\u2019t doubt that sleeping in what equates to essentially a storage area is going to mess up anyone\u2019s sleep quality. \n\n3. Finally, why would you want your child on a completely different level of the house as compared to you and your spouse? There\u2019s a reason bedrooms are often clustered together: so you can get your kids and get out. \n\nIn the case of intrusion or fire are you going to assume that A. You can access the basement in a timely manner to get you child or B. That your child will automatically know what to do? Look up the statistics on children who hide from fires instead of escape. \n\nWouldn\u2019t a basement with supposed easy exits also mean easy entrances? If I was thinking like a thief, I\u2019d go in through the basement. Do you want your child to be the first person they run into? \n\nFor my own peace of mind, I don\u2019t even allow my pets to sleep much further away from me than in my room or directly outside my room.
