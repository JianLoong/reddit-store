I hope y\u2019all have an AMAZING wedding and YEARS of happiness!!", "100% NTA\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e sounds amazing, congrats to you two! Jess seriously needs a reality check. The point of the jumpsuits are to make Kylie feel included without showing up the bride. Kylie sounds happy with this. Your sister can't understand that not only is she outshowing the MOH, she's outshowing the bride too. And your parents agree??\n\nDo not let your sister into the wedding. I do think you should try and explain your situation to your parents just so you don't have to lose them too, but if the don't see reason, not your problem.", "NTA, I did consider E S H instead because honestly I have sensory issues with clothes and the outfit you describe sounds like my worst nightmare and I really wouldn't want to wear it. But it's the 4000$ dress.thing that turns it, that's just odd and unnecessary.", "NTA. As the stepmom of an Autistic teen, you rock.", "Esh. Your sister sounds awful. I'd be more on her side if she had gotten a dress in the same color as the rompers. But really rompers? They're so ugly and Noone wants to have to get completely naked every time they have to pee.", "NTA not only is this grown 39 something woman throwing a tantrum like a toddler but she's trying to upstage the bride...\n \"The jumpers are ugly so now with $4000 ill look prettier\".\n\nOP ban her period or she'll do something to make your wedding day terrible.", "NTA. Your wedding your rules. This is not an outlandish request, its an accommodation. I hope everyone can come around. Good luck on your special day!", "Nta \n\nMaybe offer to have her wear her expensive dress as normal guest and not part of the wedding party. If she bitches about that, then she can sit at home with her expensive dress.", "NTA sounds like the family you are gaining are awesome and will more than make up for the assholes you leave behind.", "NTA at all, but would it make sense just to take Jess out of the wedding party and let her come to the wedding as an ordinary guest? (i can see why you and Rose might not like this solution either though, now that Jess has behaved so badly).", "NTA. And I love both you and Rose.", "NTA to buy that elaborate of a designer dress is a different way to upstage the Bride because everyone was wearing rompers and she wanted to be the prettiest.  Dresses are hugely uncomfortable for some women and most Bridesmaids dresses are not only ugly there so common. At least rompers will put a different look to it", "If the sister had already bought the dress and then you go around and change it all because some autistic teen throws a Ffing fit, then I'd be mad too.", "Omg I love it OP hahaha jumpers I think what you mean is jumpsuit. I had a good laugh. NTA and congratulations!!", "NTA", "It doesn\u2019t matter why the bride has chosen jumpsuits over dresses, the fact is the bridesmaids wear what the bride tells them. It may be beautiful, it may be hideous, it may be \u201canything as long as it\u2019s pink with yellow polka dots\u201d. Jess is refusing to wear what the bride has chosen, then double downed on being an asshole.   \nyour folks backing Jess up are just as bad.   \nyou\u2019re NTA, kudos for backing your bride.", "NTA \n\nGood for you backing your fianc\u00e9e. This is not Jess's wedding, so she doesn't get to dictate the attire of the bridal party.", "NTA; my aunt wore a purple suit for her wedding. She said she hadn't worn a dress in 40 years and she isn't starting now. \n\nTell your family that if they don't like it, take a hike. End of the day, your wedding day is about you and your bride. & whilst you may notice them missing; you won't miss the drama.", "NTA - Jess sounds like a wholesome and kind human. Congratulations on finding her. And make sure your friends are aware that they may have to remove your sister or parents off the premises though.", "Why does your sister want to look like your bride?  Ask her and your family what's wrong with her, and maybe they'll back down.", "Whilst I certainly don't agree with what you are doing, it is you and your fiancee's wedding so if you want to make everyone wear rompers just for her sister that is fine. Your sister should not continually protest about wearing a dress. So I'll say NTA, although I think it's a bit odd.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHe REASONABLE solution would have been: If she wants to be a briedsmaid, she needs to accomodate you. If not, she comes just as a guest, and can wear anything that fits the dresscode.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU are the AH here.", "Nta and it sounds like time your sister was put in her place", "YTA for over reacting and banning everyone.  Why can\u2019t Rose wear her dress as a guest?  Brides get to pick what bridesmaids wear but they don\u2019t dictate what guests wear.  Rose has a choice be a brides maid and go with theme or come as guest?  Not everyone is now banned!", "I think the main problem here is not the clothing but how the sister is YET AGAIN making it all about herself. \n\nI'd be nipping that in the bud real fast and simply not invite her.", "That looks nice on the model but they really don't make these for people like me that are fat with big boobs lol", "The sister is definitely trying to upstage the bride. Also, she didn't even get the right color! There are a wide variety of formal jumpsuits available that will accommodate different body types and looks. OP wants to kick her out because *she's* making it an issue, and the family that's backing her sounds like they never tell her no. Well, this is one event where the choice isn't up to them.", "That is not true - the original is the original and means what it says. That version is a made up interpretation that doesn't date further back than the late 1800s. It's OK to prefer the other saying, but it is not the original version or the original meaning.", "\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\nSet the rules for your new family early.", "Haha, yeah I had a confusing mental image until I realised he meant a jumpsuit", "Yeah I had the image of either Harry Potter style xmas jumpers or Nike tech jumpers in my head \ud83e\udd23", "Oh! I'm fat and have some big ol' boob. And I actually wear super cute rompers regularly. My favorite are the kind that look like a shorter dress.", "what's wrong with that? As long as it isn't white...", "\"I hope someone will make sure there's a following \"accident\" with her designer dress too.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDestroying a 4000 $ dress can be quite expensive, when you have to replace it.", "I wore a big puffy ballgown style dress and peed by myself fine. There are strategies \ud83d\ude05", "It's not only fancy, it even gets bonus points from me for having a witchy vibe.", "How tf did you take this lovely gesture and turn it into a negative? I'm also autistic, and we don't know what the situation was. I highly doubt they all chose it 'in honor of her autism'. Maybe they just saw the jumpsuits and decided they were actually really cute?\n\nBut even if the bride, who clearly loves her sister, wanted to do it for her anyways, who cares? It's her wedding. There's absolutely zero indication that the sister requested that everyone dress like her. \n\nAlso, asking for the \"special treatment\" of accommodating sensory issues is not at all unreasonable?! Forcing disabled people to just sit and suffer silently through life without ever speaking up is not how changes are made.", "I'm autistic and my son is as well. \n\nI think this isn't an accommodation that the sister asked for. It reads to me like it's an accommodation and choice on the brides part. \n\nA lot of brides want everyone to be dressed the same (though i like it more when everyonedresses how they are comfortable), this is no different regardless of the reason. It's a brides choice, and if someone doesn't like it, they should come as a guest instead.", "You didn't read what I wrote, did you?\n\nNowhere did I say that the sister should have to wear something she isn't comfortable in, did I?\n\nI specifically said she should be able to wear the jumper or anything she wanted to. You can go read what I said right now. It's still there.\n\nI don't like being treated like I'm \"special.\" I was very, very disabled as a child, and I *hate* being treated like everyone should cater to me. Like just treat me like a normal person and knock it off with the pity and trying to accommodate me by being so condescending.\n\nI get that this is what the bride wanted to do, but I find it infantalizing. Let her sister wear the jumper so she is comfortable, but making the entire wedding party wear one is just - it makes me so uncomfortable.\n\nTo me, it's saying, \"don't we deserve a pat on the back for appeasing our autistic sister?\" It makes the sister look infantalized and then the bride look like she's trying to make it about herself.", ">I'm autistic and my kids are autistic and I wouldn't request special treatment or request that everyone dress like my kids just because they want to wear something. I kind of don't like the \"let's treat everyone with a disability like they're special\" thing. \n\n>request special treatment\n\n>just because they want to wear something\n\nDid *you* read what you wrote?", "Yep. I wouldn't request other people dress like me. I can't stand being singled out or being treated like I'm \"special.\" I think treating the disabled like this, so you can get ass pats for all the \"awww, how sweet\" hugs you'll get, is kinda gross.\n\nMy weird shit is my own. My kids weird shit is their own. I'm not going to spend energy drawing attention to any of it. Let people be disabled without a spotlight on them.", "Jess could wear something she is comfortable in without wearing a $4000 dress in the wrong colour.  I'm sure something could have been found that was complementary, if you know, Jess would just be reasonable.", "NTA.\nMy only slight agreement with your sister is not all rompers are created equally. I have one I got on clearance for $6 from giant Tiger this summer that I get so many compliments on and feel awesome in. But I have tried many many on before where I look like a gross orangutan in the mirror. They don't suit everyone. If your sister wasn't such a brat I might say compromise, let her get a dress in the approved coloring by your fiance. I don't personally like the matchy matchy of everyone in the dress but your sister trampled over that and did what you wanted. I wouldn't put up with it either", "NTA and why woudl you want this self centered middle aged toddler at your wedding? Same goes for her enablers. \n\nGlad you have your fianc\u00e9e's back. Have a lovely wedding", "NTA.\n\nTime to go NC with them.\n\nIts your wedding. fk \u2018em.", "NTA. Congrats on your engagement.\nRose sounds like an absolute legend and I wish you all the best. You sound like a legend for defending your fiancee's wishes against your family. Your sister sounds like a pain is the arse who needs to learn to pull her head in.\nGood on you OP.", "NTA. I don't understand why some people crave drama so much that they just create clouds of it around themselves. You and your fiancee can have whatever kind of wedding you want, and are free to invite or uninvite anyone you want. It is your wedding, and no one but you and your fiancee have a right to be there. Everyone else is there for you.", "NTA, as you clearly said... its mot about her purchasing a dress instead ... its the fact that she intentionally is trying to not only outshine the bride and bridal party but her dress doesnt even fit the fucking color scheme. Like seriously Jess? Fuck your sister and your parents for enabling her bullshit, I bet shes the golden child... and a terrible sibling.. I'm sorry you had to grow up with that.", "NTA the reasoning for the jumper decision isn\u2019t even important, so not sure why so many commenters are morally evaluating the why. Bottom line, what the couple/bride in this case says, goes. Or don\u2019t be part of the wedding. \n\nBanning her outright was maybe extreme, but this seems like someone who is not above extreme measures to get attention, be it within the wedding party or not.", "You are not banning your family from the wedding. You are telling your attention-seeking sister that she is not wearing a 4k dress to your wedding designed to outshine the bride and which is not in keeping with the other members of the bridal party. and shutting down the moaning. A man who has his future wife's back with family - congratulations to your future wife for picking a keeper and you for picking a woman who, on your special day is thinking of her sister's needs. Not a trace of bridezilla.  May you have a long and happy marriage.NTA", "I don\u2019t know why your sister feels like she deserves to be catered too. The autistic teen has more social graces than she does. NTA. You and your soon to be wife are gems, your sister is a massive area of opportunity as are your parents.", "NTA. Sounds like your sister sees what everyone is doing and thinks \"oh good spotlight will be on me!\"", "NTA. You're wedding your choice. What makes your day Great for you. Hope you have a long and happy marriage.", "NTA honestly what Rose is doing with Kylie is super cute - what a beautiful thing between them.  Honestly Rose sounds like an amazing woman, she will make a wonderful mother if you decide to have a family.\n\nAs for your family - good for you for telling them not to attend if they carry on encouraging and defending Jess.  Also 4 grand on a dress thats not a wedding dress - she is seriously trying to be the centre of the attention. She can throw her own party and wear it. Make sure you have bouncer at the door with her photo and of the dress - if she comes anyway as a a guest and is wearing that dress they turn her out before she come's in and causes a scene.", "NTA", "NTA! If your own sister can\u2019t set aside her ego for one day, it\u2019s understandable why you wouldn\u2019t want her to attend. Your wedding day should be a once in a lifetime happy event and don\u2019t let anyone spoil it for you or your bride. She seems like a very kind woman if even SHE is willing to compromise on what she\u2019s wearing to her own wedding. You made a great choice in marrying her. Trust me, you do not want negativity and unnecessary stress on the big day. If that means your sister and/or mother can\u2019t attend than so be it! Frankly it\u2019s is not about them. It\u2019s about your bride and you, and what/who you want at YOUR wedding. Again, NTA", "Yta why can't she just not be a bridemaid and just come in a dress. Jumpsuits are very hard to pull off. I wouldn't stand up in front of people wearing one and I certainly wouldn't look good in it. I think not liking the bridesmaid outfit dress or jumpsuit is a perfwctly good enough reason to drop out of a wedding party. You are basically saying wear this outfit even if you hate it or you're not invited. You've bent over backwards for one person and then univited another for exactly the same reason. Your prejudices are showing", "ESH. Jess for being an entitled unpleasant person. But on the other hand, if you don't want her to be bridesmaid, that's fine, but you're jumping to kicking her out from your wedding literally because you just don't like the colour of her dress? You're a grown ass adult too, act like it and tolerate that people are allowed to make (appropriate) choices even if you don't like them. It's not like Jess wanted to wear white at your wedding.", "INFO:  Why don't you want her there as a *guest* wearing a dress?\n\nI guess I am not fully understanding.  You say Jess \"bought her own bridesmaid dress.\"  But it's not a bridesmaid dress, since the bridesmaids aren't wearing dresses, and the dress isn't even the same color to look like she is part of the wedding party.  So really, Jess bought... a dress.  To wear to a wedding, that she is no longer part of the bridal party.\n\nNow, I would absolutely be *pissed* if my sister agreed to be part of the wedding party, and then pitched a fit over the bridesmaid attire.  I, personally, don't like to wear jumpers, they don't work for my short legs, long torso.  But if I was *that* miserable about it (and I am being generous, allowing that some jumpers I truly would look that dumpy in), then I would at least try to politely bow out, not pitch a fit.  So again - I get that you are angry at her for freaking out and calling your bride's choices ugly.\n\nBut the ultimatum of \"be a bridesmaid in a jumper or don't come\" seems off.  Like you are either pissed at her for causing trouble and she is uninvited, or you are annoyed and she is still invited.  Being a bridesmaid should be off the table.  And if she is still invited to the wedding, then, like any other guest, she can wear whatever she wants, barring a white gown.", "NTA", "I have a formal (blush pink!) jumpsuit that I\u2019ve worn to a wedding and a wedding rehearsal and rehearsal dinner now.  It\u2019s fabulous and everyone has adored it.  I\u2019m autistic and it meets my sensory needs and it\u2019s pants, it has pockets, I can dress it up further with gold shoes and a gold belt, add a nice suit jacket or blazer for warmth and more formality, add earrings and necklace, like it dresses up well AND gets a bit more casual if I want to wear it for something more casual again sometime without all the accessories and plain flats.", "Yeah\n\nJust downgrade her to a guest and it's done.", "It\u2019s right there in the post that she hadn\u2019t already bought it.", "You don\u2019t polish yours? \ud83d\ude2e", "Me too", "Same here. I do have a very comfy onesie that I wear at home on cold mornings, but it does make me look like an overstuffed sausage. And it's so annoying having to get almost completely undressed every time I have to pee and that's pretty often.\n\nBut I would wear a bridesmaid jumpsuit any day if that's what was asked of me. Especially if it helped the bride's sister feel comfortable. It's just one day. And I'm going to be wearing spanx anyway, so toilet time is going to be a hassle regardless.", "That part if the hang-up for me, but not for the same reason.\n\nIf she is not wearing what the rest of the bridal party is wearing, and she is not even in the same color as the rest of the bridal party, then... she's not part of the bridal party, nor trying to be.\n\nIt sounds like OP's sister just bought a pricey dress to wear to his wedding, which she is now attending as a guest, not a member of the bridal party.\n\nIf this post was \"Am I the AH because I don't want my sister wearing a $4000 dress to my wedding,\" then I would say yes, AH, because people can wear whatever they want, and their budget is not your budget or business.\n\nIf the post was \"Am I the AH for uninviting my sister because my sister was rude to my bride over her wedding choices, but is insisting on still being in the wedding party,\" then I would say no, not the AH, because a couple can do what they want with their own wedding, and people should respect that.", "I also think it goes well with the shiny metal ass that those with shiny spines need to tell others to kiss.", "Enforcing that you \"have to\" replace something is pretty tricky. Even if they go as far as like, small claims court or something just double down and say \"I wasn't the one who spilled x on it.\" and unless she has video proof or something they aren't going to rule that you have to pay $4,000 based on her word alone. \n\nIt's incredibly difficult to force payment for something like this based on a he said she said situation. I guess it's possibly easier in the US because of civil lawsuits etc but that's not a cheap route and you could easily spend more than you'll ever get back out even if you win.", "No, I don't think the sister asked. I'm just saying how I would want to be treated. I'm speaking up for the dignity of the sister.", "\"but that's not a cheap route and you could easily spend more than you'll ever get back out even if you win.\" - Does not have to be cheap - if she can afford 4000 $ dresses, she can afford revenge lawsuits. And: this would not be small claims court, and she can also sue for lawer costs and more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: Most will not lie about hat they saw before court, so there WILL be witnesses."]}
