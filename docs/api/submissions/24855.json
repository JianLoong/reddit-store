They obviously didn't go to waste because it took very little trouble to sell them. Your neighbours are entitled.", "NTA I'm sure they were probably close to 1000 for the pair if not more. That's not chump change to just be throwing around for free. Did you get your full investment back?", "NTA  She wanted you to give them to her. Did she just fall off the cabbage truck?", "How much did the tickets sell for? Did the mother ever try to bargain down to a lower price?

Taylor Swift tickets are extremely valuable and I went to the Eras tour--the full experience is well worth the price of the tickets. To give them away for free would be kind, but a great loss on your part and you don't owe this girl thousands of dollars worth of tickets just because she's your neighbor. If they had offered to buy the tickets and you said no just because you wanted profit (I saw in a comment you only got $32 in profit though so I don't think this is the case) then you'd be the AH.

But the wife is one for trying to benefit from your misfortune in breaking up with GF. Anyone reasonable knows tickets are expensive and have resale value so trying to guilt you into giving them free is also unreasonable.", "Definitely NTA. You did nothing wrong. Hope the break-up isn\u2019t too rough for you. \n\nDecades ago I was a Beanie Baby distributor. Cannot tell you how many \u2018friends and friends of friends\u2019 I suddenly had. I heard every sob-story possible, as to why their kid should be given a full set. \n\nLiving in a small town, it became a mess. We had only five schools. So, I set-up a monthly raffle with each schools PTA and they made lots of cash for various teams, clubs and Booster Clubs etc., from my free donations. \n\nAdditionally, I would replace \u2018lost\u2019 Beanies free of charge and donated hundreds to sick children. Loved doing that and TY company eventually gave me hundreds of free items to donate. \n\nSadly, I was still considered an AH. Some people are never satisfied.", "That\u2019s more than a laptop or a big screen TV.  Hell no!  NTA", "NTA, why on earth would they expect them for free lol", "NTA the fact that her parents didn't want to pay you for the tickets and assumed that you would just give them away because she's a 15 year old girl is ridiculous and reeks of pure entitlement. Your neighbours should understand that you spent money and you wanted to recoup your investment and it wasn't a gift.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really would like to have your house when you move next time. How many tears do I need to squeeze out for you to give it to me instead of selling it?", "NTA - I honestly hope you were petty though and somehow let your ex know you had the tickets and sold them.", "You paid $1600 for the two tickets.\n\nAnd your neighbour called you an asshole, greedy basterd etc. for basically NOT GIFTING them $1600 !?!\n\nI'm at loss for words about this type of entitlement, so I'll just add NTA", "NTA. Dude, they demanded you give them $1600 tickets for free? GTFO. That's ridiculous.", "Scalping where I am at is perfectly LEGAL.  You offered them at face value, or at least at what you paid for them, and the entitled neighbor wanted them free.  Inform 'Kim\" that SHE ruined her daughter's dream by being a greedy cheapskate.

Cleared a cool $32 profit)", "I guess she felt that since he was single now and have no kids then he shouldn't have any problems with eating a $1600 loss.", "It cost me about 800 each.

We had some lady came in and buy 100 kid's meals because we were no longer selling the Bennie baby toys individually.

This is her fault for not managing her daughter\u2019s expectations.", "You are a decent person, OP, and they are outrageous. I'm not a Swift fan either, and even I know you could have sold those tickets for a LOT more than $1600.

You are SO NTA.", "Holy fucking shit, i just came back from a festival, 4 1/2 hours away by car(in germany) and the whole 4 days including gas, food, merchandise and a lot of beer and booze didn't cost half of one of those tickets.\n\nYou are so extremely NTA", "Oh lawd, those Mini-Beanies became the bane of my life. Totally different licensed production team. Those loving Grannies were something else and every local dog was fed Macs Nuggets for months, lol.", "Eh, she was offered the tickets at face value twice. What he would have taken from a stranger has zero bearing on his AH status. He'd be a moron to let them go to waste if Kim didn't want to pay anything. Even getting half would be a smarter play than giving them away", "32 dollars profit probably went partially on postage, they cost OP 1600"]}
