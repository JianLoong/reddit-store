She is, however--agreed by all parties--very emotional and prone to tears. That's fine, I knew what I was signing up for, it's just relevant context.\n\nRecently, I had a birthday. My wife asked what I wanted to do for it. I said that I would really like to just have a quiet day, mostly at home: wake up late, have coffee, play some video games, and the two of us could go for dinner. If we needed to do anything else, we could get a massage. She tends to prefer parties and big events, while I like to relax. If she just got dinner reservations somewhere lowkey and, maybe even wore something sexy, that would be perfect. I wouldn't want anything else.\n\nThat can be hard for her to understand, I think, because it's so different from her preferences, so she set up a big party. She told me the morning-of that she had invited some people over to celebrate. I said \"oh, okay, that's not what i was expecting, who is coming?\" I think she could tell that I was a little disappointed, because she started to get kind of defensive saying its just a few of our friends and they want to be with me on my birthday, etc. And that's fine, it's not a big deal, it isn't like I hate parties or our friends, so I said okay, and we went about the day. \n\nSome friends and a couple family members started arriving around noon and people stayed until about 6pm. It was nice to see people, no major issues, just not what I would have chosen for a big day off type of thing. I tend to like to relax and reenergize on weekends and find events like that when I'm the center of attention draining. \n\nMy wife seemed a little on edge, though, and that night while we were cleaning up, she asked how my birthday was. I said it was pretty good with a little bit of a shrug. Admittedly, that wasn't the most effusive praise, but I dont like to be dishonest. It was fine but not spectacular. She got really upset and burst into tears, telling me she had worked hard on it and its so challenging when I won't participate or tell her what I want. I said that its okay, its not a big deal or worth being so upset over, and I appreciated the effort she went to and it was nice to see people, but I felt like I had been pretty clear about what my preference would have been and it seemed like she didn't listen to me. That made her even more upset, and she said she couldn't believe she did so much for me and instead of thanking her, i made her cry. (I had thanked her earlier fwiw)\n\nThe conversation didn't make much progress from there that night, but it still feels like a sore spot for us. She has been annoyed with me the past few days for \"ruining\" my birthday. I don't want to be ungrateful, but don't really feel like I should be apologizing here.

Are you sure nothing else is going on with you and your wife? How are you when it comes to her birthday? If she asks for a party do you go all out for her or do you plan based on what you like? Does she have to tell you what she wants before you do it or do you try to do things without being told? What I see in some relationships is one person needing to be proactive and almost anticipate their partner\u2019s needs. Meanwhile the other person sees that as their partner\u2019s normal behavior not realizing it\u2019s going above and beyond. This might be her way of communicating she wants to be appreciated when she does things that go beyond what was asked. In a perfect world you would have celebrated your birthday exactly how you want. But the fact that there are communication issues still lingering make me think they have been there for some time.

However, I do not like surprises like this. My ex went and planned a surprise party for me, that I hated, and when we discussed it later he said he \"had to\" because I did it for him. It was all for appearances. Apparently I had been given \"credit\" for his party, therfore in his mind, he had to do one also, to \"look good\".
