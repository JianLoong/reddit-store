She is, however--agreed by all parties--very emotional and prone to tears. That's fine, I knew what I was signing up for, it's just relevant context.\n\nRecently, I had a birthday. My wife asked what I wanted to do for it. I said that I would really like to just have a quiet day, mostly at home: wake up late, have coffee, play some video games, and the two of us could go for dinner. If we needed to do anything else, we could get a massage. She tends to prefer parties and big events, while I like to relax. If she just got dinner reservations somewhere lowkey and, maybe even wore something sexy, that would be perfect. I wouldn't want anything else.\n\nThat can be hard for her to understand, I think, because it's so different from her preferences, so she set up a big party. She told me the morning-of that she had invited some people over to celebrate. I said \"oh, okay, that's not what i was expecting, who is coming?\" I think she could tell that I was a little disappointed, because she started to get kind of defensive saying its just a few of our friends and they want to be with me on my birthday, etc. And that's fine, it's not a big deal, it isn't like I hate parties or our friends, so I said okay, and we went about the day. \n\nSome friends and a couple family members started arriving around noon and people stayed until about 6pm. It was nice to see people, no major issues, just not what I would have chosen for a big day off type of thing. I tend to like to relax and reenergize on weekends and find events like that when I'm the center of attention draining. \n\nMy wife seemed a little on edge, though, and that night while we were cleaning up, she asked how my birthday was. I said it was pretty good with a little bit of a shrug. Admittedly, that wasn't the most effusive praise, but I dont like to be dishonest. It was fine but not spectacular. She got really upset and burst into tears, telling me she had worked hard on it and its so challenging when I won't participate or tell her what I want. I said that its okay, its not a big deal or worth being so upset over, and I appreciated the effort she went to and it was nice to see people, but I felt like I had been pretty clear about what my preference would have been and it seemed like she didn't listen to me. That made her even more upset, and she said she couldn't believe she did so much for me and instead of thanking her, i made her cry. (I had thanked her earlier fwiw)\n\nThe conversation didn't make much progress from there that night, but it still feels like a sore spot for us. She has been annoyed with me the past few days for \"ruining\" my birthday. I don't want to be ungrateful, but don't really feel like I should be apologizing here.

Despite you being a grown adult that clearly communicated what you wanted with her. \n\nShe should be apologizing for not listening to her partner and deliberately ignoring her partner's requests and preferences in favor of what she wanted.\n\nAlso quit excusing her behavior and rug sweeping it as \"she's emotional\".

My husband is similar to that. I struggle often with his birthday and other celebration days because to me it's a chance to remind someone with gifts and favorite foods and time together how much they are loved and appreciated. However, knowing that my husband does not like crowds or large (anything more that 3 or 4 people) groups, I do my best to keep it simpler. I and the kids get him a few gifts and have whatever he asks for dinner. I don't go out of my way to invite \"extra\" people or do things that would make me happy on his birthday. That is the major difference with your wife. She completely disregarded everything you told her you wanted and decided to do it her way instead. If this is a pattern of behavior, you need counseling so a third party can witness and mediate discussions of boundaries. If this is a one-time thing on her part, a serious discussion of why she thought that was a good or even a kind thing to do is in order.

Your wife is likely a great person but in the instance she is being extraordinarily selfish. She is purposefully not listening to your wants and projecting her own ideas as better than yours. \n\nI hate forced social events. I don\u2019t mind parties, but I have to mentally prepare for them. I enjoy not having to entertain or speak to anyone other than my husband some days.", "[sings] After Everything I\u2019ve Done For You (That You Didn\u2019t Ask For) [/sings]\n\nSorry, fell down a CXG YouTube hole recently.\n\nAnyway, NTA. Look, I hate it when people say that anytime a woman cries she\u2019s being manipulative, BUT. This is transparently manipulative BS and if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t let it pass. She\u2019s trying so very hard to make the fact that you didn\u2019t jump for joy over her completely disregarding your wishes for your birthday to be your fault, but nope. This is actually a pretty shitty way to treat you and you aren\u2019t obligated to put up with just to keep the peace. That\u2019s not a healthy relationship dynamic.", "NTA\n\nYou both are opposites when it comes to certain preferences. I think in this case, it's not that she didn't hear you, but she just couldn't put herself in your headspace. In her mind, feeling loved and appreciated for a party meant surrounding you with your friends and family. She tried to hear you and likely felt that sounded lonely and not how to really celebrate a birthday event. But, to you, it was about spending time in your comfort space with her (the person you love) surrounded by the things that bring you comfort and peace. As an introvert myself, I get that. I much prefer a quiet time with my husband and kids in my home doing relaxing things. That's far from lonely. So, while your wife heard you, she wasn't really listening to your needs. You handled it well. You understood where she's coming from. You voiced your opinion delicately enough. You mentioned she can be sensitive, and her crying was unfortunate but not surprising. Have a sit-down with her and reiterate how you truly appreciate her efforts, but you did tell her before what you wanted. Ask her why she decided to go with the party anyway. It might help her to understand why the party was just not something you wanted (albeit appreciated for her desire to treat you with friends and family) for your birthday celebration. She needs to learn to understand your headspace and how much you desire the comforts of home and just her sometimes without the company of friends and family.", "NTA- ah yes, you and I are very similar and my mother still doesn\u2019t quite understand it \ud83d\ude02 some people really struggle with understanding that others have different social batteries and are recharged differently.

Despite being abundantly clear, some people just don't believe me when I say I don't want a celebration. They think I'm just being modest and/or because parties is what people do, to not have a party reflects poorly on them.\n\nI don't see why you should apologize. I think all you have to tell her is that you appreciate the effort but you truly don't want a party.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhen she asked you how you wanted to celebrate your birthday, you expressed your desire for something simple. Quite the opposite happened. She didn't listen to you, and it's your birthday. You have the right to express your opinion, you have the right to celebrate in your own way. She cried because her ego was hurt and because she doesn't need much to cry... She was expecting praise. And instead of sulking, she should have apologized. Cause if anyone \"ruined\" your birthday it was her with disregard for your wishes.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds like she has some internal people-pleasing issues.  She feels like she has to go above and beyond to get affection and approval, even if it's exactly the opposite of what you want.  \n\nDid she grow up as the perceived \"bad seed\" ve a sibling who was the \"golden child\" that got all of her parent's attention and affection or something like that?  She may have some deep seeded issues that need to be resolved.", "NTA. My husband and I have a very similar dynamic. I had to learn that when he said he wanted to take it easy or have a low key birthday, he really meant it. I felt like if I didn\u2019t put a lot of effort into planning special occasions, whether with friends or nights out or whatever, I was being lazy and not loving/supportive.\n\nHowever, loving someone is LISTENING to them. If you\u2019re the type of person that generally means what they say and don\u2019t tend to be coy, play games, etc., then she needs to learn to LISTEN to what you say. You have every right to speak your mind, as does she.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you were rude and you shared your feelings as politely as possible.

I said \"thank you\" and I do appreciate your effort. But the person who should be most annoyed in this situation is ME. You asked me what I wanted, I told you, you did something completely different, and then got upset with me because I wasn't thrilled. What you did was nice, but it wasn't what I wanted.

It looks like you told her what you wanted to do for your birthday, and she did the exact opposite.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry your wife is upset and feels unappreciated, but if you ask someone what they want, YOU DO WHAT THEY TELL YOU. She decided her preferences were better than yours, in other words, you don't really know what you want. And that's disrespecting boundaries.", "NTA - She did the opposite of what you clearly stated. She planned what she would want on her birthday. The crying and then trying to guilt you for a few days seems like it would get old but that's what you signed up for.", "Why is she making it about her lol? NTA", "NTA. You did tell your wife exactly what you wanted. She decided not to listen and did what **she** wanted for **your** birthday instead. Getting upset because you weren't overly thrilled is a her problem, not yours.", "NTA. You said what you wanted. For more explanation read the other posts.\n\nHowever, I married a woman not unlike this myself, and my advice (we're past the stage where you are now) is to be *more* assertive about what you like and want, while also being clear that you know who she is, what she wants, and that you want to be a part of *all* of it. \n\nExplain that it's exactly because of your differences that you enjoy your life with her, and that this was a birthday that, while not perfect for you, was nonetheless fun for *this* year, and that it taught you a lot about how *she* wants a birthday celebrated.\n\nThere will be tears, there will be self-pity, and you'll need to repeat the salient points multiple times through the discussion. It's also highly recommended to spend the whole time making physical contact with her, especially including frequent hugs and similar overt affections.\n\nI love that my wife wears her heart on her sleeve, and I even love that this very trait makes her get things wrong sometimes. Life would be boring living with Martha Stewart or June Cleaver. \n\nThe best piece of advice I can give is that when she loses it, the best medicine is a very long hug. (To the tune of 15+ minutes.)\n\nNo, you're NTA. But this is definitely the hardest part of the relationship, and it's going to take a LOT of time and a LOT of reassurance to get past it. It took us about 2 years, but once we got past it communication became world easier (she learned I mean what I say), and she learned that all the big emotions are the reason I married her.\n\nGood luck!", "She got really upset and burst into tears, telling me she had worked   \nhard on it and its so challenging when I won't participate or tell her   \nwhat I want.  \n\n\nNTA.

She decided that nope, that\u2019s not the \u2018right way\u2019, so you\u2019ll be celebrating **her** way. \n\nPersonally, I think you were extremely kind and measured. I would have been far more upset. What she did crushed every single one of your boundaries. Yes, she went to a lot of effort, but she cannot expect you to be thankful of work that you actively asked her not to do. That\u2019s like rearranging someone\u2019s house without asking \u2018to be helpful\u2019 and being upset when they say \u2018dear god why\u2019 because you put in a ton of effort. It\u2019s just\u2026not it. \n\nI think a discussion with your wife is in order. You\u2019re appreciative of the effort, you clearly love her deeply, *but social gatherings aren\u2019t something you enjoy*. You\u2019re an introvert - it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like people, or spending time with them, but you find peace and energy spending time with yourself (and probably her).
