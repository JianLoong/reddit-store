She is, however--agreed by all parties--very emotional and prone to tears. That's fine, I knew what I was signing up for, it's just relevant context.\n\nRecently, I had a birthday. My wife asked what I wanted to do for it. I said that I would really like to just have a quiet day, mostly at home: wake up late, have coffee, play some video games, and the two of us could go for dinner. If we needed to do anything else, we could get a massage. She tends to prefer parties and big events, while I like to relax. If she just got dinner reservations somewhere lowkey and, maybe even wore something sexy, that would be perfect. I wouldn't want anything else.\n\nThat can be hard for her to understand, I think, because it's so different from her preferences, so she set up a big party. She told me the morning-of that she had invited some people over to celebrate. I said \"oh, okay, that's not what i was expecting, who is coming?\" I think she could tell that I was a little disappointed, because she started to get kind of defensive saying its just a few of our friends and they want to be with me on my birthday, etc. And that's fine, it's not a big deal, it isn't like I hate parties or our friends, so I said okay, and we went about the day. \n\nSome friends and a couple family members started arriving around noon and people stayed until about 6pm. It was nice to see people, no major issues, just not what I would have chosen for a big day off type of thing. I tend to like to relax and reenergize on weekends and find events like that when I'm the center of attention draining. \n\nMy wife seemed a little on edge, though, and that night while we were cleaning up, she asked how my birthday was. I said it was pretty good with a little bit of a shrug. Admittedly, that wasn't the most effusive praise, but I dont like to be dishonest. It was fine but not spectacular. She got really upset and burst into tears, telling me she had worked hard on it and its so challenging when I won't participate or tell her what I want. I said that its okay, its not a big deal or worth being so upset over, and I appreciated the effort she went to and it was nice to see people, but I felt like I had been pretty clear about what my preference would have been and it seemed like she didn't listen to me. That made her even more upset, and she said she couldn't believe she did so much for me and instead of thanking her, i made her cry. (I had thanked her earlier fwiw)\n\nThe conversation didn't make much progress from there that night, but it still feels like a sore spot for us. She has been annoyed with me the past few days for \"ruining\" my birthday. I don't want to be ungrateful, but don't really feel like I should be apologizing here.

Despite you being a grown adult that clearly communicated what you wanted with her. \n\nShe should be apologizing for not listening to her partner and deliberately ignoring her partner's requests and preferences in favor of what she wanted.\n\nAlso quit excusing her behavior and rug sweeping it as \"she's emotional\".

My husband is similar to that. I struggle often with his birthday and other celebration days because to me it's a chance to remind someone with gifts and favorite foods and time together how much they are loved and appreciated. However, knowing that my husband does not like crowds or large (anything more that 3 or 4 people) groups, I do my best to keep it simpler. I and the kids get him a few gifts and have whatever he asks for dinner. I don't go out of my way to invite \"extra\" people or do things that would make me happy on his birthday. That is the major difference with your wife. She completely disregarded everything you told her you wanted and decided to do it her way instead. If this is a pattern of behavior, you need counseling so a third party can witness and mediate discussions of boundaries. If this is a one-time thing on her part, a serious discussion of why she thought that was a good or even a kind thing to do is in order.

I think in this case, it's not that she didn't hear you, but she just couldn't put herself in your headspace. In her mind, feeling loved and appreciated for a party meant surrounding you with your friends and family. She tried to hear you and likely felt that sounded lonely and not how to really celebrate a birthday event. But, to you, it was about spending time in your comfort space with her (the person you love) surrounded by the things that bring you comfort and peace. As an introvert myself, I get that. I much prefer a quiet time with my husband and kids in my home doing relaxing things. That's far from lonely. So, while your wife heard you, she wasn't really listening to your needs. You handled it well. You understood where she's coming from. You voiced your opinion delicately enough. You mentioned she can be sensitive, and her crying was unfortunate but not surprising. Have a sit-down with her and reiterate how you truly appreciate her efforts, but you did tell her before what you wanted. Ask her why she decided to go with the party anyway. It might help her to understand why the party was just not something you wanted (albeit appreciated for her desire to treat you with friends and family) for your birthday celebration.

It\u2019s about HER feelings and HER plans, not what you wanted for your birthday.", "NTA\n\nYou said what you wanted and she did the exact opposite.\n\nHowever, before deciding your wife was being manipulative I'd ask yourself this: are you usually honest and up front about what you want?\n\nIf not, your wife may now be very used to having to tease out what you actually want.\n\nFor example: \n\n- I went to quit my job recently and asked my husband if he was OK with that. He said \"sure you do whatever makes you happy\". I know my husband is very financially prudent and cautious so I suspected he wasn't being up front about his feelings. 2 hours of coming at the subject sideways later he admitted he was nervous about it but I'm so clearly unhappy that he didn't feel he could say that.\n\n\n- We're renovating the house. My husband is leaving a lot of the design choices to me saying he doesn't have much of a preference and he'll live with whatever. I tried for 4 months to work out what he wanted and gave up. It wasn't until I had planned the colour scheme for the living room that he tells me he doesn't like yellow as a  living space colour. Fine. I ask him what colours he would like and get a \"whatever you want\" again. I plan for a green brown cream colour scheme. Nope he doesn't like Green. I'm now on my third run through and it looks like violet is a winner. Apparently he does have preferences but he's not telling me up front.\n\n\n- His dad does it too. I went to order takeout and asked if anyone had cuisines they didn't eat. Nope all good. I go to order Indian (one of the few things open) and all of a sudden he doesn't like Indian.\n\n\nI have hundreds of other examples but I can't assume everything he says first can be ignored because sometimes he's upfront about what he wants instead. I think it's a culture or family thing but damn is it annoying.\n\nIf you're prone to doing this I can see why your wife might have planned a party instead and why she might have started crying or been upset.\n\nIf you're not doing this kind of stuff then I'm not sure what her deal is.", "NTA.  You gave her a list of things that you two could do together.  None of your suggestions included friends and family or any party at all.

She doesn't listen to you and constructive criticism is met with tears (which will eventually make you stop giving her your opinion.)  I think you guys might benefit from some marriage therapy, because over the years, this will be a huge drag on your relationship.", "NTA. She sounds exhausting. Why does she expect you to be constantly considerate of her feelings when she's not considerate of yours? Just because she can't wrap her damn head around wanting to relax doesn't mean she should disregard your wants on your birthday.", "NTA, but it may not be that she's not listening to you.\n\nMy wife likes to do big things for birthdays etc, but I am like you and prefer relaxed events and I hate being the centre of attention. It took some time before she understood that I genuinely didn't want a fuss though, because she thought that I just didn't want her to go to lots of effort, or that I felt awkward asking for lots of attention.\n\nIt might be worth having a talk with your wife to see if she's of the same mindset. If she genuinely knows that you really don't like or want anything big, she might actually enjoy planning the low-key stuff that you'd like, as it seems like she genuinely does want to make you happy.", "NTA: my husband likes low key stuff like this and it is EXTREMELY hard to think he\u2019s being honest. I think it\u2019s because I grew up expected to downplay what I wanted. With that said, I do my best to listen and respond accordingly. He\u2019s always happiest when I do!", "NTA\n\nThis seems like it might be an ongoing problem, and something you might want to sit down with her about. If you tell her a preference and she ignores it, and then gets upset that you're less happy than you would be, then it sounds like she's projecting her wants onto you. If that's unintentional, more open communication should fix the issue as long as she listens. If it's intentional you may need to set further boundaries.\n\nIt might also be helpful to clarify that you answered the questions she *asked*, not the ones she may have wanted the answers to. She asked how your day was, you gave an honest answer. She did not ask if you enjoyed seeing your friends, liked the party, or appreciated the effort she went to. \n\nMaybe make it clear that you're sorry if she feels undervalued, but that her disregarding your clearly stated preferences in relation to your birthday is kind of rude of her? Like yeah, if she's planning it, she can plan whatever, but if you plan someone's birthday and pick things they're ambivelent to/don't like/wouldn't want and they don't have fun, that's on the party planner? At least in cases where the birthday person gave genuine clear feedback on what they wanted and weren't like...hugely rude/toxic", "NTA whatsoever\n\n\"She got really upset and burst into tears, telling me she had worked hard on it and its so challenging when I won't participate or tell her what I want.\"\n\nExcept (unless you're lying to us which I have no reason to believe) you DID tell her exactly what you wanted. She chose to ignore your wishes anyway, and do what SHE wanted.\n\nHer behaviour is really, really uncool. It sounds like she refuses to understand or accept that you're an introvert unlike her, & that her preferences are not universal. It's okay to be emotional, but don't let her big feelings overshadow the fact that *you* are the one who was done wrong by her in this situation. You have absolutely no reason to feel bad, and it's not your responsibility to regulate her emotions by coddling her. \n\nAnd then she had the audacity to tell you that you ruined your own birthday??? 1. Hell no, if anyone ruined it, it was her. 2. It's not her f'n birthday! She doesn't get to decide whether or not it was \"ruined\" \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It sounds like she thinks the whole world revolves around her.\n\nOP you deserve an apology!", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ruin anything and you have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA.

You told her flat out that you wanted a quiet day at home", "NTA.\n\nI think I can give you some insight here, as this is the exact dynamic between me, an introvert, and my wife, an extrovert.\n\nFor my wife, the extrovert, being among people and parties and events gives her immense pleasure and provides energy to her spirit. For me, the introvert, being among people and parties and events, while enjoyable, drains me of energy and I need quiet time alone to recharge. \n\nI work in a big office filled with busy, boisterous people that just drains me. I have to put on my \u201cbest self\u201d jacket and go to the office and be in the middle of everything. So I really do require some quiet downtime to recharge my battery. \n\nFor my wife, who works in a very small, quiet office, her daily routine drains her of the joie de vivre she needs to be her best self. She needs people and parties and events to recharge her battery.\n\nAs we speak, she is downtown at some big champagne shopping event with 6,000 of her closest friends, and I\u2019m sitting in my quiet office doing basically nothing. We are both recharging our batteries.\n\nOnce she and I learned how to navigate this dichotomy, life got a lot better for us.", "NTA. You told her what you wanted for your birthday, she didn't listen or worse, thought she knew better, and did the exact opposite of what you wanted.

I don't know which one is worse. OP, please have a meeting with a marriage counselor and talk about boundaries and talking and listening to the other partner.", "NTA\n\nI want to offer a perspective though.

He even has gone to great lengths to say \u201cdon\u2019t do anything for my birthday\u201d, but he really wants something done for his birthday. \n\nIt is possible your wife thinks you are this guy. Maybe instead of a few quick sentences, have a full on conversation about it and be totally honest.", "Is your entire relationship all about her getting her own way OR pouting and crying when she doesn't? \n\nNTA, by the way.

Our usual family birthday celebrations (pre Covid) was dinner out at the birthday person\u2019s choosing. Now it\u2019s at home.  He then planned a cookout with about 5 couples in addition to family.  I am also partially disabled and tire easy so 2-3 hours after it started I had to excuse myself to lie down.  I am very uncomfortable with this many people. He said it wasn\u2019t for my birthday but everyone brought cards and gifts.

Try to be perfectly clear next time that you do not, under any circumstance, want to do anything next year for your birthday. The best gift she can give you is to do absolutely nothing for you. Or maybe just give you a nice sexy time. But no parties. No one over. No friends. It\u2019s your day and you want to spend it with yourself, and maybe her. \n\nOn her special day, she can decide how she wants to spend it and you\u2019ll support her to make it happen.\n\nThat seems perfectly fair.

The tears, whether real or not aren\u2019t a fair reaction on her part.", "NTA. You were very clear about what you wanted, your wife ignored your requests and organised what SHE wanted to do and then specifically asked you how you thought her arrangements were going. I\u2019d probably have been less polite about it than you were.", "NYA.  Let me give a rambling story to support why. \n\nOof.  A few years ago, I had a friend (since cut out of my life) that decided I was having a birthday party.  I absolutely hate celebrating my birthday for a list of reasons, but that\u2019s not important\u2026but I\u2019ll note she was plenty aware of those reasons.  Got a month, she would bring up celebrating my birthday, to which I would always directly say I was not interested in doing, and that I was looking forward to a quiet evening to myself.  Added to the usual list of reasons to not celebrate, there was a work related thing happening that had me working a busier schedule than usual, and she knew this also.  She kept pressing that we absolutely had to celebrate.  I concessed that maaaaaaybe if the day goes smooth, I might visit the idea of grilling burgers or something, but I\u2019m going to want to get to bed early.  \n\nWell, come that day, things went to shit.  Had to deal with broken equipment, and had a migraine on top of that.  By 11am, I was already 100% done with the day and just wanted to get done what I had to do, and be in bed.  I got my ass chewed out because she worked so hard to put this party together (she actually suckered another friend in to doing all the work) and to top it off, all the things she claimed to have worked hard on were things that she knew very well that are the things I despise of.  I found that even people she was telling her plan to told her that this is absolutely not something I will enjoy.  Even after all this, she acted so shocked when I said I was not attending.  \n\nWhat I learned from all this was that really her motivation was to get sympathy from people for me not appreciating all her effort.  What really happened was they all said that if she thought I would enjoy this, she doesn\u2019t know me very well.  It was also noted that she was very jealous that I was seeing a girl, and although she made it very clear that we were friends and not a couple, she lost her shit to see that she didn\u2019t have all control over me.  \n\nAnyway, what can I tell you, OP, from this?  If you communicated all along that you don\u2019t enjoy that kind of gathering for your birthday, and your wife still put that together, do not feel any guilt.  She willingly put effort in to something you said you don\u2019t want.  And quite frankly, if you fake appreciation for it, you will never get that quiet peaceful day again.  It sucks, but sometimes you have to be blunt and let feelings get hurt so that you don\u2019t deal with this forever.", "Wow she\u2019s a piece of work, even put on a performance with gaslighting tears and a \u201clook what you made me do\u201d. \n\nYou were perfectly clear, she just didn\u2019t listen because she doesn\u2019t care or respect you.

And you didn't even get mad at her for not listening.  Nta", "NTA \n\nSeems like you clearly explained what you wanted to do for your birthday, and she arranged nearly the exact opposite.", "NTA \n\nWhen it is not your birthday and without emotion you need to explain to your wife that your preference is staying at home etc\u2026 \n\nThat party is what she would like you to do for her! She is projecting then wanting you to find joy in it.", "She threw a projection party, doing what she would want and thinking she was being very sweet to you. But you'd told her what you wanted and she couldn't fathom that as a birthday, so she ignored it.\n\nNTA Maybe next time she should pay a little more attention if she wants you to enjoy your birthday.", "NTA - What she did was disrespectful in my opinion. If you just wants to relax, do something private, then she shouldn't go against that. \n\nThe fact that it was a lot of work for her is irrelevant, or even makes it worse, she went out of her way to do something you didn't want.", "NTA. No one can MAKE another person cry. Granted some people are more prone to tears than others (I am one of those.) How she responds is on her, don\u2019t let her saddle you with her tears. Correct her the next time she tries to use her emotion against you.", "NTA.  You clearly stated your preferences and she ignored them and did something that was all about what she wanted to do.  I am definitely like you\u2026being the center attention gives me major anxiety and I would react fairly strongly to be put in a situation that I never asked for or specifically said I didn\u2019t want.  \n\nYou really do need to sit her down to reinforce the fact that when she asks you a question and you answer honestly, that\u2019s it.  \n\nHappy Birthday.  \u270c\ud83c\udffc", "This very much so reads like Diane and Mr. Peanut butter\u2019s relationship on bojack horseman. This exact situation happened. Diane didn\u2019t want to do anything for her birthday, but Mr. Peanut butter planned an entire, very extravagant party", "NTA, your wife is though. She didn\u2019t listen to you, planned something FOR you without your input, then guilt-tripped you with her crocodile tears. She needs to get her emotional outburst in check, and pay attention to your preferences! \n\nI would HATE a big party for my birthday (which is on Tuesday!) I seriously just want to chill out and eat Thai food. That\u2019s it. If my partner planned a party for me, that would feel like work. Work to socialize, work to get the house cleaned up, work to feed our friends\u2026nah. Talk to your wife so this doesn\u2019t happen again. Maybe she\u2019ll listen this time\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Glad your wife's tears aren't beating you into submission. Even if they are genuine impact vs intent are two different things. If she's always like this it sounds exhausting. NTA by a longshot", "NTA- your wife is selfish and has no respect for your needs.\n\n\nShe asked you what you wanted and then she said \u201cnah, we\u2019re doing this instead.\u201d\n \nSHE wanted a party.\n\nAnd when you rightfully complained,she made herself the victim .\n\nYikes. \n\nI\u2019m sorry OP. Your wife sounds exhausting.", "NTA\n\nUgh....you DID tell her EXACTLY what you wanted for your birthday:\n\n\"I said that I would really like to have just a quiet day, mostly at home: wake up late, have coffee, play some video games, and the two of us can go for dinner. If we needed to do something else, we could get a message.\"\n\nI suppose you could have described what clothes you wanted to wear but, other than that, you were extreeeeeemely specific. Instead of doing what you wanted, she proceeded to schedule the day that SHE wanted. And now you're the bad guy and she brings on the waterworks? Please.\n\nThis is really manipulative behavior. This isn't \"really emotional and prone to tears.\" This is getting her way and attempting to make others feel guilty for having their own needs/wants, and it has clearly been effective. Was this learned? Is this the way that she behaves with her parents/siblings?\n\nHopefully some couple's counseling can help her to see how manipulative her behavior is, and help you to see that there are two people in your marriage and each of you need to feel heard and supported. Because living with a woman behaving like a toddler is no way to be.", "NTA, your wife did what she wanted for your birthday, not what you wanted.", "This. My husband is very similar to OP. I\u2019m similar to the wife. Birthdays are a big deal for me and I love celebrating. My husband is perfectly happy playing video games in his underwear and being left alone. So\u2026 when his birthday comes around I try and keep the in-laws at bay, make a nice meal for us, and let him do his own thing. Internally I hate it because I want to celebrate and how I feel about birthdays I get a nagging guilt that I\u2019m being neglectful. But it\u2019s what makes HIM happy on HIS birthday.", "Why is that so hard for some people? It\u2019s maddening!", "Well. Not just men.

Her reaction was to essentially gaslight OP over it and derail it into \"see all MY WORK that you don't APPRECIATE\".\n\n\nMy mother is very much like this. Every birthday and event needs to be done her way, and she gets upset if you aren't playing the role you're assigned. She uses birthdays, holidays, and events as a means of showing her tangible effort and is heavily reliant on the praise and thank yous that follow. It's to the point where as an adult I don't even mention my birthday because the thought of throwing a party is exhausting to me.", "It\u2019s the same talk I have with an extraverted 8-year-old at work who can\u2019t always grasp that kids and people in general are different and not everyone wants to charge their batteries by being around people.

But left handed ones.", "Not poor listening, she heard and chose to do what she wanted to do instead and then weaponized crying. She sucks.", "She is a manipulative asshole.", "As an adult,  I\u2019ve organized every birthday party or birthday event I\u2019ve had.", "I agree that at this point it must feel like beating a dead horse with this issue bc I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. But I do think OP and his wife need to communicate with a therapist and either get to the bottom of why the wife ignores OP\u2019s wants and needs or maybe OP can see it\u2019s time to move on. All the talking in the world won\u2019t change someone who isn\u2019t willing to change like you said and OP was very clear from the start. But it doesn\u2019t sound like OP wants to end their marriage over this. I think they might see in therapy that they have more problems than OP realizes and either they will grow and learn together or do it apart.", "I don\u2019t like throwing that word (narcissist) around but I agree. I made a comment that pointed out how shitty this was and she clearly did it for her, not for him. She wanted to look good in front of their friends instead of honoring her partners wishes. Then demands thanks and when she doesn\u2019t feel the thanks were good enough she turns on the water works. Lastly when you also consider the tone of the original post, it\u2019s clear OP is patient, kind and loving! OP deserves better."]}
