You obviously didn't have a problem when he was doing it with your son.", "YTA. \n\nYou're not going to be able to protect them from hearing questionable-lyric music.  It's better to be exposed to it in the house. \n\nLong-term, the kids will feel like they can talk to you about these topics, which (I assume) you want, too.", "YTA, is this fake?  It is hard to believe that this is legit.", "NTA. Not that the lyrics make a damned but if difference to your daughter.

It was the only song I knew. He doesn\u2019t even remember it.", "YTA. A 1 year old can\u2019t interpret or understand the song. Let him have his fun.", "NAH. Does your son run around quoting these lyrics? If so, it\u2019s time to stop. But singing a \u201cdirty\u201d song to a 1yo is not much harm.\n\nThat said, you and he should probably have a calm conversation about your general expectations of language around your children - swearing, sexual subjects, etc. - so you\u2019re on the same page. Both what both of you will avoid and also when to introduce age-appropriate conversations about sex, body parts, consent, etc.", "NTA - I\u2019ve always hated when people sang gross songs to my son. I don\u2019t care that he can\u2019t understand it, it\u2019s weird, and there\u2019s a million songs that aren\u2019t disgusting.", "My parents played Frank Zappa (among other) songs to me when I was little. My favorite songs were \"Nanook of the North\" and \"Billy the Mountain\". When I was ready to go to pre-K school, this became a teaching moment of what was appropriate to say in certain settings. I could sing \"Watch out where the huskies go, and don't you eat the yellow snow\", but I could not sing \"A mountain is something you don't wanna f*ck with\" when I was at school. \n\nWhen kids start repeating the words they hear, use appropriate language. Until then, sing or read whatever keeps their attention or puts them to sleep.", "I have an adorable video of my son dancing to \"Get Low\" and Cardi B when he was a toddler.

Words were spoken.", "I appreciate your desire to protect your little ones, but yeah ... YTA.\n\nImagine how many young moms fervently wish their husbands would play and sing with their babies. Singing in Spanish to a 1-year old might as well be Martian.

Like Macarana was a very dirty song, took me forever to actually listen and go wtfh!? One of my favorite childhood memories was giggle with my sister in Dad's truck when Big Balls played! I now do that one for karaoke as 1, reminds me of a good time,  2, others enjoy it! 3, look of shock on people's faces \n\nBtw, I absolutely will sing Barbie Girl and stuff to my 3 yr old niece, but her favorite song is Crazy Train. \ud83e\udd23 When she gets a bit older maybe I'll sing the Pussycat Song to her, another I'll do at karaoke...", "Haha honestly, the song is smooth but they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying at all.", "YTA she doesn't understand the lyrics and probably isn't even talking yet. All kids understand is the tone you're using. Relax. Its not an issue until she can repeat the words he's saying.", "YTA, they\u2019re not understanding the meaning. it\u2019s a wholesome moment of their dad singing to them.", "YTA I doubt your one year old knows what it means and still it's in spanish.", "I just shivered in digust at the idea of singing such sexualized garbage to prepubescent children. NTA, you need to have a serious conversation with your husband about boundaries and ethical parenting. Scratch that, you need to draw boundaries ASAP. Your husband does not need a talk, you need to readjust him.", "NTA- there is a five year old in the house who may be curious. There is also no reason to do this. So many songs to choose, why sing anything that AH ever sang ever, let alone to his female child. Is he ok if his so e sings this to his girlfriend in the future. \n\nAnd what age do you stop. Kid absorb everything. Does he know the exact month when her understanding becomes problematic. \n\nWill she be asking her older dad what that song was that she recalls him singing to her?\n\nWill he do this when anyone else is around to accidentally overhear. \n\nJust pick a different so g baby daddy or do you need to look into deeper misogyny issues?", "YTA, please, its not even a question.", "I don't know about you but most songs from the 90's and early 2000's were inappropriate but we listened to and sang them.\n\nIt's just music. If he's not singing curse words who cares. Let him enjoy the moment with his kids, they're having fun. The kids don't know they're singing anything inappropriate, they just enjoy singing with their dad.\n\nYTA", "nta bc why is he singing songs made by abusers/rapists", "NAH. He\u2019s singing these songs because it\u2019s what he knows and they likely have a good rhythm and beat that the kids can dance to. If you are truly concerned, sit down with your husband and tell him your concerns ([5-year-old] is at the age where he might be singing that at school and that may be frowned upon. To help ease that, let\u2019s try to focus on something the majority of the populace views as kid-friendly). If you take the time to calmly and rationally go through everything, you and your husband will likely come to a compromise. It may be starting the journey to being absolutely sick of Disney songs, or other kid-show songs (baby shark\u2026*shudder*), but at least it will help calm your fears.", "YTA children that young don\u2019t understand the words they just like hearing the rhythm and voice of the person singing", "NTA because they learn so quickly at early ages. I would be concerned that extremely sexualized lyrics would make kids easier for predators to groom, let alone the fallout if they burst out into song at school or daycare.
