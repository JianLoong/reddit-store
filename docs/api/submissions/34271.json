We are homeowners and have had some trouble with our next door neighbors. They're a young nuclear family, two parents in their 30's with a little baby.\n\nWe aren't the type of neighbors to spy into yards or monitor what everyone is doing so we hadn't really noticed that their backyard is a pigsty, at least not until our fence panels had been broken. These neighbors had been piling trash and leaning it up against OUR fence, and eventually the sheer weight of it had just broken it, causing it all to spill into our yard. There were old pieces of wood, metal, garbage bags, pieces of furniture and just general clutter and crap.\n\nI confronted the neighbors and informed them of what happened. I asked politely that they clear up the garbage and contribute some money towards a new fence. The husband said he'd sort it out, but after 2 weeks of no change, I knocked on their door again. The wife gave some excuse about how the baby has been crazy but that they would get rid of the garbage asap. Another 3 weeks and nothing. I knocked on their door at two different times, left messages on their ring doorbell and messaged them both on Facebook and it has been radio silence. They've also not given us any money for the fence but to be honest I don't even care.\n\nAfter no response for another week, I took matters into my own hands. I loaded up THEIR garbage into my car and took it to the dump. They're now angry and said that we have no right to get rid of their stuff and it's still their property. When the wife turned up at our door we got into a small argument as she threatened me with small claims court, saying that we owe her and her husband money. I called her a Karen and told her if the stuff  was so important she shouldn't have left it littered around in my yard where my kids play for over a month. She says that they would've gotten rid of it if they were given a chance, the nearest dump is over an hours drive away and they dont have all the time in the world.

You gave them five weeks since you first talked to the husband and they did nothing. They're fortunate you aren't charging them for the dump fee (my city charges to dump stuff at the city facility). You could have thrown it back to their home and you didn't. \n\nWhat exactly would they take you to court over? Cleaning their garbage? Saving them time and money? Or are they saying their garbage wasn't garbage?", "NTA they damaged your property and then they abandoned their items on your side of the fence. That's property damage abs littering that they're guilty off, and it's unlikely that any court would grant damages for property they abandoned on someone else's land.  YOU should be taking them to small claims court about the damage to your fence.", "The garbage from their yard was spilled into your yard, on your property. After 30 days, and your attempts to get them to claim their \"goods\" from your yard, that became abandoned property and you had the right to remove it however you saw fit. And you can legally counter claim, in that same small claims court, for the damage the weight of their stuff caused to your fence. (That is, assuming, you have plenty of photos of that mess for evidence!) NTA", "You should take them to small claims court.  But before you do, reach out with a certified letter asking for them to either fix the fence or give you $X, by a set date (usually want to give a month at least.) Also, you may want to ask them for money for having to remove the junk they dumped in your yard for weeks. And for any damage to the yard and costs to fix it. \n\nKeep notes in a journal about any other interactions with them.  And, if they don't respond by your date, take them to court.  Judges look very favorably on plaintiffs who try to solve their own problems before filing a suit.  \n\nKeep notes.  Be calm and polite. Don't argue or interput if they start lying, just wait your turn. Also, get an estimate from the most expensive contractor you can find (thats the amount you ask for in your letter) and bring that written estimate to court. You may also want to sue for missing work and hiring child care to go to court.  Not likely to get it, but if they're dicks to the judge you may get lucky.  \n\nAbove all: don't threaten to sue them.  Ever.  Don't ever list consequences in your letter or conversations with them.  Just ask for the money you're owed and give them a date you'd like it by.  If they ask or else what?, don't day you'll sue them.  Just say nothing.  \n\nNo threats. Just get an estimate, send the certified letter with delivery receipt proof, then sue them if they don't pay. \n\nDo not have any conversations with them about this in person. Only where you can have a record. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe makes no sense. If she was planning on hauling it to the dump, you saved her a trip, and she should be thankful and apologetic. \n\nShe abandoned her property in your back yard, and despite several attempts on your part, made no attempt to reclaim it (not even drag it back over the property line on to her land).\n\nShe'd be laughed out of court.", "NTA - keep a log (even after the fact) of all your interactions with those hillbillies. Don\u2019t worry about small claims court. They dumped trash in your yard, you can counter sue.", "Absolutely NTA! They are lucky you didn't call the police for them littering on your property and destroying your fence.", "NTA - the only things I would have done differently would be to record the interactions (check the recording laws for your state), as well as followed up with your concerns in writing via certified mail (documentation is vital). Then I would have paid a company to come clean everything up, and saved the receipt.\n\nNow that the neighbor has brought up SCC, I\u2019d just go ahead and get it started. Some states you can start it all online, then just have to go in person to sign and notarize.", "NTA call code enforcement and child protective services. Code enforcement for trash being large enough to break your fence, and child protective services to protect the child as it\u2019s probably worse inside the house.", "NTA they abandoned trash on your property for over a month and refused to clean it up.  I would take them to small claims court for the cost of removal and the repairs to the fence, as well as any other costs you've had to take on because of this.", "NTA - Legally, I\u2019m not sure how sound what you did is, with property laws and whatnot varying on location. But regardless of legality, they\u2019re definitely the AHs for breaking your fence and leaving their trash in your yard for a month.\n\nBefore you moved their trash, I think it would\u2019ve been better if you took them to small claims yourself, or contacted the sanitation department. I think legally that\u2019d help your case. But I also don\u2019t blame you for what you did, and I don\u2019t think any court would fault you for tossing trash that was left on your property.", "NTA assuming you removed only the items that fell through onto your property.\n\nThey left it unretrieved for at least five weeks on your property. If they take you to court, submit a counterclaim for the cost of garbage removal.", "NTA. They won\u2019t take you to small claims court, but if they do, they will be laughed out of it.", "NTA and they owe you money for damaging your fence. You should sue them. They can\u2019t sue you for anything. Are they mad because you did them a favor? I guess they think their trash wasn\u2019t trash", "NTA.  Call the city, county, who ever handles nuisance properties.  Trash like that attracts vermin and depending on where you live, venomous snakes.  Their yard is a hazard and you gave them plenty of warning.", "NTA\n\nThey should have immediately cleared up their mess.", "Hell no.  Get your crap off my property.  Don\u2019t care about anything else. Get your garbage off my property now. Not soon.  Now.", "NTA. Property likes be damned. It sounds like a shared fence and they ignored the issue. It was a safety concern. I have a neighbor who piles stuff on our shared fence. So I know how you feel.", "Obviously, NTA. First, I would have just thrown their stuff back in their yard, and 2nd I would have closed the door on them before entering into an argument. These people are ass holes and not worth your time.", "NTA. Id make sure I was taking documentation pictures of everything just to make sure you have proof", "NTA -\n\nIt was on your property, and you took care of it.  All they had to do was clean it up, and they did not for approximately 5 weeks.\n\nYou removed a safety hazard from your property.", "NTA, you asked and asked.", "NTA - Yard sounds dangerous if there is enough trash to knock over a fence. You should report them to local council/the city if you can. They still owe you the cost of fixing the fence too.", "NTA. As long as you took pictures before and after and all pictures have a date/time stamp on it, let her take you to small claims court. Then you can counter sue for the clean up costs and to pay for fence damage.", "Nta and people who can't clean up 3 yards of trash on 3 months do not have the capacity of navigating small claims.", "Next time just get the Authorities involved - NTA", "NTA, if the trash was in your yard. You had a perfect right to clean it or throw it back into their yard.", "NTA but I would not have taken their stuff to the dump. That is too much effort.  I would have just tossed it back into their yard. \n\nI had a neighbor who used to pile junk up by the property line and eventually it ended up in my yard. So, I moved his junk back to his yard and put up a privacy fence one foot in on my side of the line (it was surveyed when I bought the house). The property line literally is against their garage/apartment they live in and I wanted it close to the line but far enough in to prevent them from claiming use of it. \n\nSo what does the neighbor do?  Piles his junk up against my fence. Every time I would see this, I would move it back onto his property thinking he would get the hint. Nope.  So then I made a bunch of signs and laminated them and stapled them on his side of the fence. I wasn\u2019t nice either.  \n\nWhen he seen the signs he started yelling and cussing at me. I looked at him and said the fence is on my property not his. I pointed out the survey stakes. Told him the fence and the signs were the direct result of him not being a good neighbor by putting his junk in my yard and against my fence. If I see it again, he will be hearing from my attorney after I make a police report.  I also mentioned that I worked for my attorney (which I did at the time). \n\nNever had a problem after that.", "Info: Did you take away just what was on your property and not theirs, as verified by a surveyor?", "NTA.  Their stuff in your yard, you were a good neighbor and talked to them about it. \n\nLet her take you to court, she will use.  Did you take pictures?", "Well obviously they got severe mental heath issues, horderers. I wouldnt expect them to clear anything lol and call cps because I w\u0131uld be concern about the baby.", "If the neighbor can\u2019t get rid of trash in the yard it\u2019s highly unlikely they can get their shit together sufficiently to file and prove a Court case, and if they do counter sue for the cost of the fence. NTA", "In most states after 30 days it's abandon property so you had ever right to get rid of it. Let them take you to small claims you can counter sue for the damaged fence, dump fees and maybe gas and time driving to the dump and back.", "Cleaned it up if given a chance? What they heck did they call that month of warnings?", "NTA. Tell them to go ahead.", "NTA. Five weeks is plenty. They should have been embarrassed rather than threatening you.", "Are you joking? NTA.\n\nTheir staff was on your property, and it was big of you to not proceed with legal action for them destroying it.", "NTA. \n\nI would have responded to her small claim threat with, \"Great - keep me posted, because we have a counterclaim for the cost of the broken fence. Have a good day.\"", "OP is asking if she\u2019s the asshole for calling the neighbour a Karen. Based on that question, I would say YTA. Calling someone a Karen is antagonizing and never solves a problem. I can\u2019t understand why any adult would use this childish term. Grow up, use your words and say what you mean to your neighbour. \n\nPersonally, I would have explained from the get-go that my children play in the backyard and they can\u2019t have the garbage there, and if it\u2019s not removed in a week we\u2019ll have it removed and put on their front property, where it\u2019s easiest to cart to. I\u2019d also sympathise with her because having a baby is not easy, and having a baby and an (ostensibly) lazy husband is even harder. A little kindness and empathy can go a long way.", "Question: why did you go to the trouble of loading it and taking it to the dump one hour away rather than placing or even passive aggressively heaving it back into their yard? \n\nYou call it garbage but was there anything that may have had value in the pile? \n\nThe only reason I can think of for spending extra time and effort is punitive. That\u2019s an asshole move. Still, I approve tho.", "NTA - well youre def not the AH but taking that trash may not have been the best idea", "I don't think it matters who's the AH here, it'll be worked out in small claims court.  Good luck.", "NTA, but still potentially legally liable for their crap.", "ESH\n\nYou were in the right from the start.  They owed you for your fence from negligence damages.  That is the law in most states.  It also can be called continuous trespass.  While the damages weren't severe, they are real and have a legal remedy.  They should have respected that.\n\nHowever, you did cross a line by taking their trash and throwing it away.  That's more invasive than their original behavior.  It was clearly trash and their argument is bullshit, but lost a bit of control.\n\nNow... calling the neighbor a Karen.  That's the most harmless part of this IMO.  I would recommending reaching some sort of peace here because you are neighbors.  Your Karen comment only twisted the knife.\n\nIf you are up for it, I would buy some diapers for the baby with an apology.  You may think \"fuck that,\" but I would say take the high road and wrap this dumb shit up.\n\nEdit: I saw a comment where you didn't cross any property lines to obtain the trash.  If that's the case, then fuck the apology.  NTA.", "YTA for using a sexist slur, NTA for asking them to move their garbage. At this point it's best to call the city and let them handle it since the neighbors aren't cooperating.", "YTA.   \nYou should have handballed this to the HOA or local council or whomever is responsible for making sure public health is good in your area. Rubbish like that is a breeding ground for rats, so you had a fair complaint. But instead you entered their private land, took their \u2018stuff\u2019 (regardless of it\u2019s value) and threw it away.", "You drove someone's trash an hour away? Yeah I don't believe that. I would have put it on their porch or better yet just yeet it back onto their property", "NTA, but after asking them to clean up with no result, you should of called the city and let them handle it.  I'm sure there are laws against it.", "NTA. I hear your frustration. \n\nBut unfortunately, if she takes you to court, she might win.", "Why would you take their garbage? Was it on your lawn?

Why open yourself up to this type of animosity and possible legal action just because you wanted to be petty? YTA.", "YTA.  Most places (as far as I know) can't   force a neighbor to contribute money to a fence. And if you went onto their property that could be condsidered trespassing and theft.  Does it suck when neighbors don't contribute to shared fences, yes its an AH move but in most places not illegal.", "You had no right to get rid of their stuff.

It just devolves into a series of escalations, each more enraging than the last. It's usually best to live and let live - If you replace the fence, build it high and with solid concrete footings (so the posts are buried in concrete under the ground). It should last 20 years if made well and with good materials. Mount cameras on your property, and then do your best to utterly ignore your neighbors. Life is to short to spend it dealing with trashy neighbors.", "NTA but the smart thing would have been to either move it more INTO the middle of their yard or called the city to see what your options were.

I'm hoping you documented this through pictures because a shared fence is exactly that, it shared, and at least in California (The California Good Neighbor Fence Law) if you put one on the property line between you and your neighbor you literally legally have to both pay half, but then again if she was the reason it broke she might actually have to pay for all of it. Tell her you're going to sue her.", "So NTA you did one of there chores, they would laught her out of small claims court unless she could prove she was keeping diamond in trash bags out side.\nBTW I'd build a bigger fence they sound terrible also do you have a HOA", "NTA.

Calculate an appropriate hourly labor wage, transportation fee, and per bag handling fee for the entire job.\n\nAfter that, get three or so quotes for the fence repair from *licensed* and *insured* contractors. Pick whichever you think will do the best job for a reasonable amount and have them repair the fence. \n\nFinal step. Compile all the evidence together - photos, conversation screenshots, dump receipt, contractor bill for the fence repair - and file all that into a lawsuit against them.\n\nIf you want to sprinkle in a little bit of extra petty confetti, you can also file reports with CPS, the EPA, and the local government about your concern for the state of the neighbors\u2019 property.

In addition, you may have a negligence claim, which could open other types of damages.  So this isn't a \"they are the only ones with a case\".  You could easily rack up more in damages than they have in value of stuff and let the judge know you are open to a settlement of zero dollars each.\n\nCheck your local ordinances on abandoned property.  If it fits, then you just ask the judge to summarily dismiss their claims.\n\nIf not, then they will need to provide a statement of the market value of the property you removed.  This will be problematic for them because if they try to claim a high value or make up property, then it undercuts their story when you show evidence that they did not immediately reclaim it.\n\nUnfortunately, you did not document the incident.  This would have aided you.  Pictures of the initial incursion, inventory of the items, etc.  But you weren't expecting her reaction.  Which is odd considering the situation.  If it was really trash, then they are coming out ahead since they didn't have to do anything and have convinced you to repair the fence on your own.  Consider this your fair warning that they will continue to be unreasonable.  Get a journal and start documenting everything.

A month goes by, then another and another.  No comment, nothing.  I sent them a letter asking for the deposit back.  And then I sued.
