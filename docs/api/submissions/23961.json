AITA?\n\nEdit: I am asking for judgement on my comment to B, NOT on the fact I didn't look at A's baby pictures. A didn't care, she just shrugged. B is who I am asking judgement for.

What B said to you was uncalled for and you shut her down without even being nasty. She just can't handle having her own hypocrisy pointed out to her.", "NTA.  Well done -- and also, much nicer than saying \"Oh God, you're not one of those people whose whole personality is wanting kids, are you?\"  The way you did it, it sounds like you'll be friends with some of these coworkers.", "NTA - well done for such a quick quip and comeback! \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even say you were rude - she was for calling you a bitch", "Lol, NTA. Great comeback comment\n\nYou're allowed to not like babies, I don't either and pass whenever someone asks me to look or say \"cool, congrats\". Seems like A wasn't offended. And if B can't take a rude judgey comment, maybe she shouldn't make rude judgey comments to other people. So it was a little rude, but NTA and she definitely deserved it. Everyone else thought it was funny too since she had just said something similar to you, so idk what her problem is", "NTA. It's 2023 we are allowed not to be interested in having kids or other peoples kids. I see people saying you should have just looked at the pictures to be polite but if you did that it would mean more baby pictures in your future. It would be a waste of your time and A's time.", "NTA\n\nLemme be clear: Nobody is obligated to look at pictures of babies. I have had abortions in the past and if someone had guilted me about looking at pictures of their child I would have burst into tears. I want children, but cannot have them due to my finances. \n\nPeople don't think about these things and don't see why others may not want to see pictures of their babies. It's entirely uncalled for to comment on it and not move on from the conversation when a no is given.", "NTAH. Lol, sounds like the mom in this situation totally got it. Sounds like coworker B has a real bee in her bonnet to me. Don\u2019t feel bad for challenging rude behaviour. That\u2019s not rude, but assuming you hate children just because you didn\u2019t want to see baby pics isn\u2019t. \n\nHonestly I wish people would mind their own business about stuff like this more. I personally skip all baby announcements and photos because I can\u2019t have my own biological children and it\u2019s painful. I would have been much more rude than you were to B", "NTA. She was rude both for her statement/accusation and for blocking the hallway.", "NTA you gave her, her own comeback that's perfect", "I think your response was pretty genius about Skyrim. And to be honest, the baby pictures, too! \n\nMaybe you were a little asshole-y in your reply but it got the point across.

I feel you. I'd rather pet a dog then hold and coo at a baby. People think that because we are female and even had children that we go gaga on all babies. A colleague had a baby and everybody was going nuts around the little thing. I showed minimal interest congratulating the new mom and when asked if I wanted to hold it I just said no. It was like I had spat on the pope or something.", "NTA. You were at work and you were walking from one place to another and they had you blocked. Even if you wanted to look at the photos, \"not right now, thank you\" was the perfect response at that moment.", "NTA. Not everybody wants to look at baby pictures! Personally, I adore babies. Do I want to look at baby pictures of people I\u2019m not really close to, not really.

It sounds like A would have just let it go without comment. Now, *I* would probably just have taken a glimpse at the baby photo, said \"very cute, congratulations\", and moved on. But that's because I'm scared of conflict. I would have been more interested in Skyrim pics, though, lol.", "No NTA \u2014 B needs to mind her own business\u2026 it wasn\u2019t even her baby", "NTA. What if you are unable to have children, and have tried numerous times unsuccessfully? It could cause some painful memories to flash up. BTDT with my wife. We went through 4 miscarriages together. Took a long time to get past.", "nta, you did exactly what b did", "Your comeback was fantastic and well deserved. Not rude. SHE was rude.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think you were rude at all. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t let any of this bother you.\n\nYou approached it in a well mannered way and gave B a taste of their own medicine. Given from her response, I think she realised her mistake.", "NTA not anyone's fan club. You were polite and it's not your thing. Being honest but not artificial. Typical work drama, move on like it never happened.", "NTA. Stay away from B. She's a mean person who jumped to conclusions about you and is mad because you called her out.", "NTA, you gave an example of how not being interested doesn't make you a raging hater. On another note, B needs a reality check that not everyone wants to dote over babies, whether it's for a private reason like infertility or any other reason, she has no right to judge like that.", "NTA; that's a great comeback!", "NTA", "NTA- you are working, you have no interest at the moment. Nothing more should have had to be said about it.", "NTA lmao", "NTA. You're allowed not to want to see a pic of someone's kid. I'm a parent and yeah I might feel a little miffed if you said no but that's on me not you, If I made a rude remark to you then I'd absolutely deserve one back.", "B's problem is not yours.  Good for you thinking on your feet", "Just be you\u2026", "NTA. I love Skyrim!! Such a great game!!", "NTA!\n\n\"do you wanna see my new weapons and armor I just built on Skyrim?\"\n\nummm...I wanna see this! I have been playing Skyrim since release. lol", "NTA, it was a great reply with the same amount of snark. Tbh i wouldn't want to really look either, and i def wouldn't know what to say that would be acceptable since you know... newborns usually look pretty.... not nice", "Hahahaha\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Good for you sticking up for yourself.", "Snap! That was a great comeback!", "Technically, NTA.\n\nYou're allowed to like whatever you want, not like whatever you want, and not pretend to be interested in the things you're not. You made your point rather neatly, and you weren't rude. B was unjustified in calling you a bitch.\n\nHOWEVER:\n\nThese are your coworkers, not random strangers. Unless your current job is merely a stepping stone to something else and you plan to be out of there soon, you may be working alongside them for some time to come. You will find the working environment much more pleasant if you feign a mild interest in whatever they tell you about their families, pets, or whatever.\n\nIt doesn't mean you have to engage in lengthy conversations about their families, or socialize with them out of hours, or listen while they bang on endlessly about who they're dating or the problems they're having with their in-laws. Not taking part in those conversations or events is a very reasonable line to draw.\n\nBut looking briefly at a photo? Moreover, a photo that celebrates a recent momentous and joyous event in A's life?\n\nIt would have cost you very little to have looked at the photo for a second or two, said \"Awww. She's gorgeous!
