I was walking from one of the offices to the main room and they were grouped together blocking the doorway and I just said \"Excuse me\", A turns to me and says hi and asks if I want to see pictures of her baby, I replied \"Not right now, thank you\", all 3 of them look at me like I sneezed on them during Covid. B then asks \"you don't like babies?\" I responded, \"no, I just don't really have an interest in them or kids in general but congratulations A\" and B then says \"oh God you're not one of those people who's whole personality is hating kids are you?\"  I just kind of stared at her and asked \"do you wanna see my new weapons and armor I just built on Skyrim?\" She looked so bewildered and said \"no, what does that have to do with anything?\" I responded \"oh, are you one of those people who's whole personality is hating video games?\" A and C started laughing but B looked really embarrassed and I overheard her call me a bitch as I was walking away. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am asking for judgement on my comment to B, NOT on the fact I didn't look at A's baby pictures. A didn't care, she just shrugged. B is who I am asking judgement for. It may come as a shock to some, but I have said no thank you to baby pictures several times and nobody gave me grief before. Just said \"alright\" and we moved on, so I felt comfortable saying \"no thank you\" here.\n\nEdit 2: Alright I'm not the AH and 99.99% of people calling me one are saying it's for not looking at the baby pictures, not what I actually was asking for advice on.

Well done -- and also, much nicer than saying \"Oh God, you're not one of those people whose whole personality is wanting kids, are you?\"  The way you did it, it sounds like you'll be friends with some of these coworkers.", "NTA - well done for such a quick quip and comeback! \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even say you were rude - she was for calling you a bitch", "Lol, NTA. Great comeback comment\n\nYou're allowed to not like babies, I don't either and pass whenever someone asks me to look or say \"cool, congrats\". Seems like A wasn't offended. And if B can't take a rude judgey comment, maybe she shouldn't make rude judgey comments to other people. So it was a little rude, but NTA and she definitely deserved it. Everyone else thought it was funny too since she had just said something similar to you, so idk what her problem is", "NTA. It's 2023 we are allowed not to be interested in having kids or other peoples kids. I see people saying you should have just looked at the pictures to be polite but if you did that it would mean more baby pictures in your future. It would be a waste of your time and A's time.", "NTA\n\nLemme be clear: Nobody is obligated to look at pictures of babies. I have had abortions in the past and if someone had guilted me about looking at pictures of their child I would have burst into tears. I want children, but cannot have them due to my finances. \n\nPeople don't think about these things and don't see why others may not want to see pictures of their babies. It's entirely uncalled for to comment on it and not move on from the conversation when a no is given.", "NTAH. Lol, sounds like the mom in this situation totally got it. Sounds like coworker B has a real bee in her bonnet to me. Don\u2019t feel bad for challenging rude behaviour. That\u2019s not rude, but assuming you hate children just because you didn\u2019t want to see baby pics isn\u2019t. \n\nHonestly I wish people would mind their own business about stuff like this more. I personally skip all baby announcements and photos because I can\u2019t have my own biological children and it\u2019s painful. I would have been much more rude than you were to B", "NTA.

I feel you. I'd rather pet a dog then hold and coo at a baby. People think that because we are female and even had children that we go gaga on all babies. A colleague had a baby and everybody was going nuts around the little thing. I showed minimal interest congratulating the new mom and when asked if I wanted to hold it I just said no. It was like I had spat on the pope or something.", "NTA. You were at work and you were walking from one place to another and they had you blocked.

Do I want to look at baby pictures of people I\u2019m not really close to, not really.

It sounds like A would have just let it go without comment. Now, *I* would probably just have taken a glimpse at the baby photo, said \"very cute, congratulations\", and moved on. But that's because I'm scared of conflict. I would have been more interested in Skyrim pics, though, lol.", "No NTA \u2014 B needs to mind her own business\u2026 it wasn\u2019t even her baby", "NTA. What if you are unable to have children, and have tried numerous times unsuccessfully? It could cause some painful memories to flash up. BTDT with my wife. We went through 4 miscarriages together. Took a long time to get past.", "nta, you did exactly what b did", "Your comeback was fantastic and well deserved. Not rude. SHE was rude.", "NTA - I don\u2019t think you were rude at all. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t let any of this bother you.\n\nYou approached it in a well mannered way and gave B a taste of their own medicine. Given from her response, I think she realised her mistake.", "NTA not anyone's fan club. You were polite and it's not your thing. Being honest but not artificial. Typical work drama, move on like it never happened.", "NTA. Stay away from B. She's a mean person who jumped to conclusions about you and is mad because you called her out.", "NTA, you gave an example of how not being interested doesn't make you a raging hater. On another note, B needs a reality check that not everyone wants to dote over babies, whether it's for a private reason like infertility or any other reason, she has no right to judge like that.", "NTA; that's a great comeback!", "NTA", "NTA- you are working, you have no interest at the moment. Nothing more should have had to be said about it.", "NTA lmao", "NTA. You're allowed not to want to see a pic of someone's kid. I'm a parent and yeah I might feel a little miffed if you said no but that's on me not you, If I made a rude remark to you then I'd absolutely deserve one back.", "B's problem is not yours.  Good for you thinking on your feet", "Just be you\u2026", "NTA. I love Skyrim!! Such a great game!!", "NTA!\n\n\"do you wanna see my new weapons and armor I just built on Skyrim?\"\n\nummm...I wanna see this! I have been playing Skyrim since release. lol", "NTA, it was a great reply with the same amount of snark. Tbh i wouldn't want to really look either, and i def wouldn't know what to say that would be acceptable since you know... newborns usually look pretty.... not nice", "Hahahaha\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Good for you sticking up for yourself.", "Snap! That was a great comeback!", "Technically, NTA.\n\nYou're allowed to like whatever you want, not like whatever you want, and not pretend to be interested in the things you're not. You made your point rather neatly, and you weren't rude. B was unjustified in calling you a bitch.\n\nHOWEVER:\n\nThese are your coworkers, not random strangers. Unless your current job is merely a stepping stone to something else and you plan to be out of there soon, you may be working alongside them for some time to come. You will find the working environment much more pleasant if you feign a mild interest in whatever they tell you about their families, pets, or whatever.\n\nIt doesn't mean you have to engage in lengthy conversations about their families, or socialize with them out of hours, or listen while they bang on endlessly about who they're dating or the problems they're having with their in-laws. Not taking part in those conversations or events is a very reasonable line to draw.\n\nBut looking briefly at a photo? Moreover, a photo that celebrates a recent momentous and joyous event in A's life?\n\nIt would have cost you very little to have looked at the photo for a second or two, said \"Awww. She's gorgeous!

But this post is making me want to play Skyrim lol. i usually just stick with the ebony mail but daedric armour has been calling my name recently", "I want to see the new weapons and armor you built on Skyrim. I don\u2019t know if I would call you an AH but you definitely kinda poked a bear when you didn\u2019t need to. Just be like \u201coh no thank you. I am happy for you but I have something to do.\u201d Or just look at the pictures and be happy for someone trying to show people some new form of happiness in their life. Show kindness when you can, especially with people you have to work with.", "Lol another anti kid person just pack it in do the world a favor you believe in population control right? Show you\u2019re committed don\u2019t just talk about it.", "NTA. B could be jealous that she was stuck seeing millionth picture of A's baby, while OP simply said pass. B can't speak up, so she has to make others as miserable as her.", "NTA. She seems like she was looking for a fight. You politely decline seeing the pictures, and she shouldn't have rejoined by asking whether you hate kids. Sometimes people don't care about kids or hate them sure, but also people get busy, feel sick, have stuff on their mind.... Why should she get to psychoanalyze you for politely declining?", "nta should have explained it was knee armor so you can't take arrows to the knees anymore", "NTA, but in future it might be easier to just say that you're busy instead.", "NTA I wish I could think of a comeback  and deliver it like you", "I like babies and I don't want to look at people's pics of babies in general.  NTA. You are not obligated.", "NTA", "NTA,  people need to respect that everyone has different interests. \nI also have to smile and nod,  when people show me their kids.....when I just don't give a shit.", "The way you did it, it sounds like you'll be friends with some of these coworkers.", "NTA You tried to be polite by saying \"not right now, thank you.\" Everything after that was your coworkers harassing you to look baby pictures.", "NTA. B deserves it. I often say no thanks when people ask if I'd like to see pictures of their kids. I have a very open face, my thoughts are clearly visible, and I dislike children so it would definitely show.", "NTA. It\u2019s not required to look at peoples baby pictures at work", "Yes, this exactly. While I wouldn't call OP an \"asshole\" she to me is an example of the world becoming more cold and more individualized. I was arguing the other day about how against ghosting I am (with the exception of first or second OLD dates and abusive people) and how people are normalizing it with therapy speak, loaded language like \"your time isn't owed to anyone. Prioritize yourself. If you don't want to explain yourself to a person as to why you don't want them in your life anymore, that's fine. No one is owed an explanation\" and that attitude just really grosses me out. The way OP acted is not nearly as bad, but still kind of falls under the same umbrella of thinking.\n\nIf I worked really hard on a painting and a coworker asked what I did this weekend so I was showing it off and another coworker walked up and I offered to show her my painting and she said \"no thanks\" coldly and sternly, I'd feel a bit shut down too. While I am not a kid person at all, and can totally actually relate to OP on a personal level, I would imagine a mother pumped full of oxytocin would feel the way I did about my painting but x100. Since I have to work with her every day and have basic empathy, I agree with you. Taking 5 seconds to peak at the kid, muster up my best poker face with a compliment seems like the best thing to do to maintain a somewhat pleasant relationship with my coworker. It just seems like the most human empathetic thing to do. Now OP had a conflict with a co-worker and is probably considered \"that cold, anti child gamer girl.\" and future interactions may be awkward. Maybe OP's fine with that. But I would want the work place to be as smooth as possible. Maybe at some point in the future if I was constantly being told about the co-workers babies at some point I'd explain that I am not super into kids, but idk, I just feel peaking at fresh baby picture and saying \"cute\" wouldn't be that big of a deal. Maybe OP prioritizes being genuine and truthful over polite. But I personally disagree.", "Why, though? OP has NO interest in seeing baby pics. Not everyone wants to see kids, especially when they're trying to work. OP was polite. Why should she give up their boundary to appease someone else?", "Sorry but because a person works with another person doesn't mean you have to act like you're all bffs. Not everyone cares about a person's momentous occasion. She had a baby. Whoopee. The mom didn't even care. It was another coworker who got butthurty that op didn't stop to vomit rainbows over a baby.", "Disagree. Nobody is obligated to feign any interest in something they have no interest in. Also by feigning interest, they will talk to you about that subject more and more and then it becomes annoying when you had no interest to begin with. I\u2019m in the same boat as OP to where I don\u2019t have or want kids. All of my coworkers know this and when they ask to show baby pictures I say no, because I\u2019m not interested in seeing them, and our working relationship is just fine.", "i mean who says she cares about her coworker or her life lol? not everyone is at work to make friends especially if it\u2019s not a career they plan on retiring in. she politely said no and the mom was okay with it.", ">you live in a society,\n\n\nWe live in a society where gamers like OP are persecuted", "Ew, absolutely not. I'm child free, kids (babies especially) make my skin crawl, and my thoughts shoe on my face. It's better for me to say no thanks than to look at what amounts to wrinkled gremlins and have the disgust show on my face.", "...saying \"Not right now, thank you\" is going nuclear? Wow. So, no one is allowed to say \"no\" to anything. Got it.", "While I agree the polite thing to do would be to just take the 5 seconds to look and comment. OP hardly went nuclear and only snapped when a third coworker got cocky.", "I usually agree. But I am a little torn on this one. May I ask why you think it for sure didn't?", "You're not my real dad", "Dude you\u2019re commenting on a bunch of posts trying to be this hard exterior conservative. I have a feeling you\u2019re actually a democrat whose pretended to be this way because your weak emotions are very liberal", "So it was a little rude, but NTA and she definitely deserved it.", "Yep. This is one of those stories where Reddit loves a comeback and drawing \"boundaries\" that just amount to never doing anything you don't want to do regardless of how little it costs you.\n\nIn the real world, many people are going to find turning down looking at a picture of a coworker's newborn and then comparing that to talking about some video game you like obnoxious. \n\nIt's totally inappropriate to call a coworker outside of their name and B escalated the conflict, no doubt. Voicing an active disinterest in a colleague's newborn because you can't be bothered for 10 seconds is socially awkward and not as clever as the responses suggest it is.", "But OP was polite. They said \u201cnot right now, thank you\u201d. Which part of that isn\u2019t polite??? The coworker is the one dying on a dumb hill by calling OP a bitch \ud83d\ude44", "You sound like an edgy teenager. Fingers crossed you are. I actually don't like baby pictures at all but LOL at comparing a bloody infection to a newborn, peak Reddit!", "Yikes", "Nerd", "Dude anyone that rambles democrat or conservative at every topic is truly a fucking sheep. Use your brain for once.", "You're the type that expects everyone to stop what they're doing to coo over your baby pictures, aren't you?", "OP ain't interested and has work to do. This might come as a shock, but no one's baby is the center of the universe.", "Wild how we can't make our own choices when given one in 2023. OP is NTA.", "You literally posted \u201cdemocrat cop\u201d on another post. So I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re the sheep, try again. You do know people can see your comments in other posts correct..?", "I can't tell you how many times I've had to fake interest in baby pictures! I do it to be polite but sometimes I'm grossed out by the drool, etc. Unless it's a close friend, I really couldn't care less because most of them look the same anyway. NTA", "Is this vanilla or modded? Drop the link if modded!", "I\u2019m aware nobodies baby is the center of the universe but if you\u2019re gonna have that attitude keep the same energy and don\u2019t give a fuck if you\u2019re an asshole or not\n\nWhy come looking for internet backup if she didn\u2019t give a shit why is she here asking about it?", "Lol bro you\u2019re over here stalking post history maybe you should reevaluate your life because you\u2019re kind of pathetic.", "Yeah I like cats but I don't care about other people's cat pics. My sister actively asks for pics of mine even though she has her own. Different strokes!", "It's true. I used to have nightmares that my babies were in a group of other babies, and I didn't know which one was mine.", "Not SkyRim, just Skyrim lol", "What basic office behavior are you referring to? Be specific here. Last time I worked in an office, no one was obligated to coo over someone's baby pictures. Or pet pictures. Or wedding photos. Or vacation slides.", "You\u2019re literally commenting on 5 different posts at the same time and incapable of controlling your emotions, and then being hypocritical as an adult\u2026 maybe you should man up, and reevaluate your life. You sound wholly unintelligent", "I\u2019m going to discontinue conversations with you. Because you have to be the DUMBEST troll I\u2019ve ever seen. My god you\u2019re like a child with no father seeking attention, it\u2019s pathetic", "Newborn snuggles are the best tho. Also the smell of the top of their head is the best smell. I have been watching my friend's newborn and it makes me miss my babies being that small, but not miss enough to have more.", "I literally called my son and nephew a \"sack of potatoes\" as in \"Look at this little sack of potatoes!\" Until they became mobile. I mean, holding a baby with your eyes closed isn't that different than holding a bag of baked potatoes: warm, lumpy, squishy, a little wet in some places.", "I'll bet. But, there's always something unique to each one, even if I don't see it because I'm not around them enough.", "Thanks I appreciate it but you fall well short of what you should be doing do everyone a favor man\u2026", "Oh, 100% I would totally have one more if my body wasn't already falling apart.", "You make no sense.

But another pregnancy would probably leave me wheelchair bound, at the very least.", "NTA I know exactly where your coming from op. I\u2019d be way more interested in Skyrim armor than in a baby", "LOL very nice and well performd clap back. Niceeee", "NTA. I love babies and Skyrim but I hate people who group together and can\u2019t fathom it would annoy other people.

You really need to get a wake up call.", "NTA. You said no, which is all you need to say about a non-work activity. They tried to be nasty to you, and you flipped it around on them.

You *gasp* could have just been... busy. At work. Shocking I know. But she had to go there.\n\nI think comparing it with something you had a great interest in that B didn't necessarily share or see the point of was a great and empathetic way to demonstrate your point.\n\nAlso, I love Skyrim too!
