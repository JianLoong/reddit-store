Well done -- and also, much nicer than saying \"Oh God, you're not one of those people whose whole personality is wanting kids, are you?\"  The way you did it, it sounds like you'll be friends with some of these coworkers.", "NTA - well done for such a quick quip and comeback! \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even say you were rude - she was for calling you a bitch", "Lol, NTA. Great comeback comment\n\nYou're allowed to not like babies, I don't either and pass whenever someone asks me to look or say \"cool, congrats\". Seems like A wasn't offended. And if B can't take a rude judgey comment, maybe she shouldn't make rude judgey comments to other people. So it was a little rude, but NTA and she definitely deserved it. Everyone else thought it was funny too since she had just said something similar to you, so idk what her problem is", "NTA. It's 2023 we are allowed not to be interested in having kids or other peoples kids.

Sounds like coworker B has a real bee in her bonnet to me. Don\u2019t feel bad for challenging rude behaviour. That\u2019s not rude, but assuming you hate children just because you didn\u2019t want to see baby pics isn\u2019t. \n\nHonestly I wish people would mind their own business about stuff like this more. I personally skip all baby announcements and photos because I can\u2019t have my own biological children and it\u2019s painful. I would have been much more rude than you were to B", "NTA.

I feel you. I'd rather pet a dog then hold and coo at a baby. People think that because we are female and even had children that we go gaga on all babies. A colleague had a baby and everybody was going nuts around the little thing. I showed minimal interest congratulating the new mom and when asked if I wanted to hold it I just said no. It was like I had spat on the pope or something.", "NTA. You were at work and you were walking from one place to another and they had you blocked.

Do I want to look at baby pictures of people I\u2019m not really close to, not really.

It sounds like A would have just let it go without comment. Now, *I* would probably just have taken a glimpse at the baby photo, said \"very cute, congratulations\", and moved on.

Typical work drama, move on like it never happened.", "NTA. Stay away from B. She's a mean person who jumped to conclusions about you and is mad because you called her out.", "NTA, you gave an example of how not being interested doesn't make you a raging hater. On another note, B needs a reality check that not everyone wants to dote over babies, whether it's for a private reason like infertility or any other reason, she has no right to judge like that.", "NTA; that's a great comeback!", "NTA", "NTA- you are working, you have no interest at the moment. Nothing more should have had to be said about it.", "NTA lmao", "NTA. You're allowed not to want to see a pic of someone's kid. I'm a parent and yeah I might feel a little miffed if you said no but that's on me not you, If I made a rude remark to you then I'd absolutely deserve one back.", "B's problem is not yours.

Such a great game!!", "NTA!\n\n\"do you wanna see my new weapons and armor I just built on Skyrim?\"\n\nummm...I wanna see this!

Good for you sticking up for yourself.", "Snap! That was a great comeback!", "Technically, NTA.\n\nYou're allowed to like whatever you want, not like whatever you want, and not pretend to be interested in the things you're not.

Creamcheese + wonton = no sirree, Bob.", "I just played through Skyrim again on playstation VR\u2026 was really cool.", "I get what your saying but I feel that having a race preference when dating isn\u2019t necessarily racist, some people just prefer other things. Now if someone were to say they wouldn\u2019t be friends with a person of a particular skin color, then that would absolutely be racist, there\u2019s no romantic interest involved there, there\u2019s no attraction to take into account. Personally I\u2019m not attracted to black women, but occasionally one will catch my eye and I\u2019d definitely be ok with dating her. But the same could be said for women of my race as well, the majority of them I just don\u2019t find attractive, but occasionally there\u2019s one I find attractive, I have my preferences just as everyone else.", "No\u2026 that is not \u201ctechnically\u201d what racism is.\n\nRacism is not enforcing your own preferences. It is discriminating, exhibiting prejudice, or being actively hostile towards someone solely based in race. Saying you do not have a physical attraction to a specific skin color is not racism unless you believe they are inferior to another race or outright exhibit hostility solely based on that.\n\nArguments like this that are gross oversimplifications of the topic are why people are becoming numb to racism when it is actually a thing. I\u2019m half black/half white (mom white, dad Kenyan), I am married to a white woman and have never been attracted to African American women.\n\nAm I racist?", "Even after all these years, I love Skyrim. Even after all the changes, updates, glitches and inevitable corrupt saves (best one was caused my my mead bottle stash in the kids room in Breezhome...i half filled the room, added one more bottle and my 360 did the red ring of death thing! Oopsie!)", "And newborns are basically potatoes. Yes, I took hundreds of pictures of my babies. Every outfit, every facial expression, etc. I'm aware that most of the pictures look just the same. But that's ok. They're of my babies, so I love them. But I do get bored of looking at other moms' potatoes after the first few pics.", "Pretty much my exact thoughts. I have no desire to look at a still image of your baby, especially a baby I\u2019ve seen before. I can pull up a still image of the kid whenever I want with this crazy technology called a memory. However, if you have your baby with you, I\u2019ll play with it for as long as it wants to play with me. They\u2019re cute, happy, and fun to interact with, but so are dogs and I also don\u2019t need to see pictures of your dog", "Shock, if you put crab in the cream cheese you get crab rangoon.", "This \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc4c", "Look, I love babies. I do.  I even chose a career where I\u2019ll encounter them often. But I like oohing and aahing while they\u2019re in front of me for like,5 minutes, maybe even holding them. Don\u2019t give two shits about picture of them. Unless they\u2019re my babies that just got adopted. Show me adoption photos aaaaall day.", "I know. I'm Chinese and had it once in my life. A (Chinese) ex-girlfriend made me try it at dinner: \"You've never had it? Oooh. It's sooo good. You'll love it!\" She was very, very wrong.", "I was going to say that! One of my favorite foods. Now I want to make some! I do have wonton wrappers in the fridge...\ud83e\udd5f", "I'm a woman. I like MY kids. I don't like most other kids. Guess I'm also a monster.\n\n\nMy nieces and nephews and my neighbors' grandkids are the exceptions. Most people seem to be raising entitled, obnoxious brats.", "The people who take it really personally when you don't like kids are usually the ones trying to convince themselves they like kids. Because they have them, and there's no going back now. Lol", "It wasn't hard because A, the person who's baby it was, just shrugged so there was no battle there.  It's why I keep saying I'm not asking about looking at the bay pictures I'm asking about the comment to B", "They're not the one coming off as a confrontational asshole.", "You sound like a pretty big AH right now", "If they seem to be coming off as a confrontational AH, it's probably because they were responding to one. ;)", "\u201cDo you actually not understand you are coming off as a massive AH in your responses?\u201d\n\nLol OP is fine. Someone disagreed with you and then you chose to be offended, thats on you.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m referring to. Don\u2019t engage in stupidness. That just makes you stupid too."]}
