When I answered the door, I was in the middle of a work Zoom meeting that I was co-leading and was a little irritated because she kept ringing the doorbell until I could answer. The woman told me she was driving by my house and could see my large apple tree in my backyard filled with big apples. She then asked if she could come into my backyard to pick them for herself to take home. I explained that it wasn\u2019t a good time as I was working. She dismissed my words and further said she wouldn\u2019t bother me, but she wanted me to let her into my backgate that was locked and she could pick the apples (for herself to make jam) while I worked. I felt she was being pushy and not listening to me, so I told her again no, it wasn\u2019t a good time. Again, she proceeded to interupt my words and tells me she was driving by randomly so she might not be on my side of town again so it worked best for her to pick them now. At this point, I\u2019m worrying about my meeting and getting irritated so I tell her she can pick them if she gives me $50\u2026 almost to appease her or maybe make her go away. She gets very angry at my offer and starts to yell on my porch that I should give them to her for free because there is no way I can eat all the apples and they will probably go to waste or rot in my yard. She yells at me that she was doing me a favor by taking the apples and I should actually pay her.  I was kinda dumb struck at this point that the strange woman is yelling at me now for not letting her onto my private property during the work day to take things from my yard for free and getting mad for telling her no. I again tell her if she wants to pay me, I\u2019ll let her do it, but she can\u2019t do it for free now. She ends up giving me the middle finger and huffs off to her car while telling me I was selfish and greedy. \n\nSo, AITA for not letting a stranger come into my backyard to pick food for free to take it home without paying me for it?", "created_utc": 1698715373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k9e78/aita_for_not_letting_a_stranger_pick_apples_in_my/", "score": 1188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The first being my big sister so, yeah I picked and delivered her two arm shopping basketsful.  The second ones being my great and great great nephews (a few years apart... my nephew is like 6 years younger than me, I had kids \"older\" he had kids younger) and we (husband and I) \"go ahead\". They said \"Thank you!\"  \n\n\nThen my ISP guy who stopped by to troubleshoot problems (twice!) and loved our baby English Bulldog asked if he could have our fallen apples and I said... come help yourself!  2 weeks later he called and asked if he still could.  I said yes! Because by that time we had given away and ate/cooked what we wanted.  He's promised a gallon of apple cider to us but we don't care if he delivers.  \n\n\nThe funniest to me was getting a call on our landline.  Yeah, we're rural and having the landline with internet (broadband) gets me a discount.  And the lady calling introduced herself by her local (I and hubby are kinda sorta via family but not) Last name and Maiden last name.  And asked nicely if she could grab a few (not bushels from one tree) because they looked so nice.  \n\n\nI told her Yes! Just don't sue us if you break a leg or ankle or get stung from the yellowjackets. She laughed and said \"Thank you!\"  \n\n\nMy love suggested asking the ISP guy if he would want some of the apples from The Shop ( a county away) where his BFF kindly let us plant a few more trees but... the ISP guy had already said he would be done after he gathered a few buckets of fallen and easily reachable fruit.  \n\n\nMy (adult) kids don't care for applesauce or applebutter... now we are reading up on Distillery stuff.  Brandy might become a thing.   \n\n\nWe lost a nice huge rock we brought from one house to another when a relative came home after 20 Federal years. We let that go because he died in a year.  \n\n\nNow the people my oldest sister sent over to ask if they can have A,B,C for free because she said we would... yeah, no.  She may be a pastor but I had to shut her down.    \n\n\nWe love giving away our produce.  That we spent hours or years getting going.  \n\n\nKeywords being We and Giving.  \n\n\nAnything else is begging or stealing.  \n\n\nAnd hubster just brought home another bushel of The Shop apples.  Maybe I'll make apple pie filling for the occasional tarts/pie.", "Release the hounds! Keep your gate locked.", "NTA.  And what if she's injured while picking YOUR apples?  I would have slammed the door in her face the first time she started arguing", "NTA.  Groceries are dumb expensive right now.", "NTA. \n\nYour property, your choice.

It doesn't matter what you're going to do with them, and despite some delusions created by peoples worries surrounding food waste the apples on your tree spoiling without being eaten is not some grave tragedy.

If this is the case, NTA.\n\nAnd I clarify because where I\u2019m from it is normal, and it\u2019s not even really considered  theft if you take a bag worth of fruit from a neighbours tree without asking.

After the fullest no, you should have closed the door and went back to work. \n\nNTA.", "ESH Alright it was rude of her to keep persisting, she didn\u2019t know what you were doing, and it was probably stressful to have a meeting. But all this aside had you not been in a meeting and annoyed by her, would you still have charged her $50 to pick your apples? Do you use all your apples? Do you have such an abundance that they are left to rot sometimes? Leaving things to rot over giving away free apples you won\u2019t use is an asshole move as well as a general statement.

We had a neighbor who had a pear tree that never picked their fruit, they'd just let it hit the ground and rot.\n\nSo I started going back there with a pole knocking the fruit out and taking it.

Don\u2019t waste them when a delicious Apple pie can be created from them. Next time just say help yourself but save you a slice if she happens to be in the area.
