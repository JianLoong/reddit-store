When I answered the door, I was in the middle of a work Zoom meeting that I was co-leading and was a little irritated because she kept ringing the doorbell until I could answer. The woman told me she was driving by my house and could see my large apple tree in my backyard filled with big apples. She then asked if she could come into my backyard to pick them for herself to take home. I explained that it wasn\u2019t a good time as I was working. She dismissed my words and further said she wouldn\u2019t bother me, but she wanted me to let her into my backgate that was locked and she could pick the apples (for herself to make jam) while I worked. I felt she was being pushy and not listening to me, so I told her again no, it wasn\u2019t a good time. Again, she proceeded to interupt my words and tells me she was driving by randomly so she might not be on my side of town again so it worked best for her to pick them now. At this point, I\u2019m worrying about my meeting and getting irritated so I tell her she can pick them if she gives me $50\u2026 almost to appease her or maybe make her go away. She gets very angry at my offer and starts to yell on my porch that I should give them to her for free because there is no way I can eat all the apples and they will probably go to waste or rot in my yard. She yells at me that she was doing me a favor by taking the apples and I should actually pay her.  I was kinda dumb struck at this point that the strange woman is yelling at me now for not letting her onto my private property during the work day to take things from my yard for free and getting mad for telling her no. I again tell her if she wants to pay me, I\u2019ll let her do it, but she can\u2019t do it for free now. She ends up giving me the middle finger and huffs off to her car while telling me I was selfish and greedy. \n\nSo, AITA for not letting a stranger come into my backyard to pick food for free to take it home without paying me for it?", "created_utc": 1698715373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17k9e78/aita_for_not_letting_a_stranger_pick_apples_in_my/", "score": 3092, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The second ones being my great and great great nephews (a few years apart... my nephew is like 6 years younger than me, I had kids \"older\" he had kids younger) and we (husband and I) \"go ahead\". They said \"Thank you!\"  \n\n\nThen my ISP guy who stopped by to troubleshoot problems (twice!) and loved our baby English Bulldog asked if he could have our fallen apples and I said... come help yourself!  2 weeks later he called and asked if he still could.  I said yes! Because by that time we had given away and ate/cooked what we wanted.  He's promised a gallon of apple cider to us but we don't care if he delivers.  \n\n\nThe funniest to me was getting a call on our landline.  Yeah, we're rural and having the landline with internet (broadband) gets me a discount.  And the lady calling introduced herself by her local (I and hubby are kinda sorta via family but not) Last name and Maiden last name.  And asked nicely if she could grab a few (not bushels from one tree) because they looked so nice.  \n\n\nI told her Yes! Just don't sue us if you break a leg or ankle or get stung from the yellowjackets. She laughed and said \"Thank you!\"  \n\n\nMy love suggested asking the ISP guy if he would want some of the apples from The Shop ( a county away) where his BFF kindly let us plant a few more trees but... the ISP guy had already said he would be done after he gathered a few buckets of fallen and easily reachable fruit.  \n\n\nMy (adult) kids don't care for applesauce or applebutter... now we are reading up on Distillery stuff.  Brandy might become a thing.   \n\n\nWe lost a nice huge rock we brought from one house to another when a relative came home after 20 Federal years. We let that go because he died in a year.  \n\n\nNow the people my oldest sister sent over to ask if they can have A,B,C for free because she said we would... yeah, no.  She may be a pastor but I had to shut her down.    \n\n\nWe love giving away our produce.  That we spent hours or years getting going.  \n\n\nKeywords being We and Giving.  \n\n\nAnything else is begging or stealing.  \n\n\nAnd hubster just brought home another bushel of The Shop apples.  Maybe I'll make apple pie filling for the occasional tarts/pie.", "Release the hounds! Keep your gate locked.", "NTA.  And what if she's injured while picking YOUR apples?  I would have slammed the door in her face the first time she started arguing", "NTA.  Groceries are dumb expensive right now.", "NTA. \n\nYour property, your choice.

It doesn't matter what you're going to do with them, and despite some delusions created by peoples worries surrounding food waste the apples on your tree spoiling without being eaten is not some grave tragedy.

If this is the case, NTA.\n\nAnd I clarify because where I\u2019m from it is normal, and it\u2019s not even really considered  theft if you take a bag worth of fruit from a neighbours tree without asking.

After the fullest no, you should have closed the door and went back to work. \n\nNTA.", "ESH Alright it was rude of her to keep persisting, she didn\u2019t know what you were doing, and it was probably stressful to have a meeting. But all this aside had you not been in a meeting and annoyed by her, would you still have charged her $50 to pick your apples? Do you use all your apples? Do you have such an abundance that they are left to rot sometimes? Leaving things to rot over giving away free apples you won\u2019t use is an asshole move as well as a general statement.

We had a neighbor who had a pear tree that never picked their fruit, they'd just let it hit the ground and rot.\n\nSo I started going back there with a pole knocking the fruit out and taking it.

DO NOT LET HER IN. Sounds psycho. And also, she may not only be about those apples, she could be casing ur house.", "Worst thing that could have happened was her giving the $50. She would have somehow extracted ore than $50 in value.", "In some rural areas this can be a pretty normal thing, so it's not super odd to ask, but this lady was *weird* about it. In my area it's chill to ask \"hey, I see you have an absurd amount of pomegranates, mind if I have some?\" And they'll usually push bags of pomegranates into your arms. But this is a red flag and just reading about her behavior stressed me out. She can get all the way off your property and fuck off forever.", "She rang the bell constantly so OP had no choice but to answer. That would have been my first clue she was nuts to think that's appropriate as OP was NOT available even though she was at home. She'd probably take too many and try to sell them. NTA", "My guess is she would have stopped eventually, and ignoring it would have been less distracting than indulging it.", "That was my first thought!\nNTA", "These kinds of folks would climb your tree, fall out of it, then sue you for their injury.\n\nI grew up on  farm, and we had people drive up and honk their horns, expecting us to serve them.", "My Dad used to answer the front door in his boxers with a handgun in his hand.  We didn\u2019t have too many repeat religions come to the door.", ">Maybe OP could put the apples in a basket on his driveway or something so they don't go to waste. \n\nThis comment really made laugh for a couple of reasons.  1)  A typical apple tree has *way* more apples ripening than would fit in a mere basket, and 2) picking those apples from a single mature tree is a daunting task unless that's your job.  Actually, it's daunting even if it *is* your job.\n\nThat's why seasonal workers are used by orchards to harvest.  I picked cherries for a commercial orchard a couple of times because my parents wanted us to appreciate the work done by seasonal workers.  The cherry trees are smaller than apple trees and it's hard, hard work.\n\nAt that time the commercial orchard was privately owned rather than owned by a consortium of any kind.", "There\u2019s a lot to be said for an outstanding pear.", "If you don't ask, you'll never know. There's a couple Apple trees at my parents' house, if asked they'd probably let the neighbors pick some (or hand them a bag full)\n\nUnless they have a plan to bake pies and make sauce, then the apples would go to waste anyway", "I have had some hippie-friends, when I was young, whom I visited often. They were living in a rented apartment. They sometimes opened their door to JW, invited them inside to chat and a cup of good tea.   \nOnce, going up to their apartment, I saw hilarious scene:  \nThe JW escaping in a hurry down the stairs and my friend, leaning on the railing, still firing questions to them, like \"And did you read the gnostic gospels?\".   \nHe defeated them with their own weapon ;)", "The neighbors or every rando driving by who could be casing the place? As in this scenario?", "No, fuck that person and the weird entitled vibes. Just saying it's not a bizarre question to say \"I noticed your tree, could I pick some apples\"", "Well, to be fair, I am easily confused for a little while longer yet. Recent surgery and pain meds are not doing me any favors at the moment. Thanks again for clearing it up and saving others as well.", "I've read that it also sometimes creates an awesome new one, too.\n\nI read an article about somebody who searches them for, I think, witch balls - some weird branch formation that means a potential new strain.", "NTA. That woman is both entitled and bat-crap crazy.", "Nta- as someone who had several apple trees with the express purpose of pressing for cider/canning/utilizing, people thinking they can come and pick a bucket full is wrong. One person might not be a big deal but one person does it, more will follow. Plus she was rude AF, 50 for disrespecting you and your property alone is fair, not even including the produce she was wanting to take.", "Oh wow! This is an unusual post.\n\nNTA, she asked and you declined! This woman was rude and entitled! Glad she didn\u2019t get into your yard!", "NTA, I had a similar issue with my lawn guy. I have a house up north I have a mini orchard. I found out my lawn guy was picking my apples and selling them. People feel like others property are their own.", "NTA- I would have just said NO and closed the door. Let her explain it to the closed door. I don't have time for BS anymore.", "I\u2019d have you yelled for her to get the fuck off my property the first time she yelled at me. You\u2019re a better person than me", "You are correct sir.
