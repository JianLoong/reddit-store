Given that you are not completely freaked out, I'm guessing this sucks financially, but won't break you since you didn't mention your parents paying for the ruined food.\n\nPrevention should be your focus now. If you own the place you live, hire an electrician to take the plug your freezer is using off the switch. If you rent, ask the landlord to do it or get permission to make the change. Now you never have to worry about it again. \n\nIf you can't make a change to the plug itself, see if there is any other place you can plug the freezer into. Even if this means moving the freezer temporarily or buying a long extension cord that can handle the amount of electricity a freezer uses and plugging it elsewhere. You can also just find some kind of box to screw over the switch so it can't just be flipped.\n\nIf neither of those things are viable, get the camera, but make it a security one that will alert you to movement. Now when your mom switches off your freezer, you can not only confront her immediately but you can turn the freezer back on and save the food. Plus you can move the camera back outside once your parents are no longer there so it's doubly useful.\n\nIf you're still wanting that acknowledgement from your mom that she totally did it and don't get the camera, find some kind of grease or whatever to put on the switch which will stain her hand even if she washes it. She will definitely get caught red handed.", "NTA. I would drop it but don\u2019t let them stay again. Tell them it\u2019s too expensive.", "You need a camera. Or some uv paint, so she doesn't  recognize it and a peeping thermometer or something that warns you, when the switch isbturned off. NTA", "NTA, but is your mother getting forgetful? You could possibly put something over the switch so it doesn't get turned off? To protect it?", "NTA. She should offer an apology. Perhaps if ahead visits again you can tape the switch or something?", "This is kind of negligent on your part there is no way a freezer should be on a switched outlet.   There are so many ways that this could have been prevented.  This was a disaster waiting to happen.", "NTA. Consider getting the screw on covers for switches that make it harder for them to be flipped. We did this because our cat sitter kept turning off our dusk to dawn porch light trying to find the right light.", "NTA, but what's done is done.  You can demand an apology, but sounds like you don't think you'll get one.  I have a switch that turns the internet off and on - I just put a piece of tape over it when I have people visiting.  Sometimes you have to treat your parents like children.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that BOTH times this happened, your Mom was around. \nHas this EVER happened before?\nMore than likely, she is embarrassed/ shameful of her actions, thus the denial. \n\nPersonally, the next time they are in your home, have a piece of tape over the switcht. That, or say you have a security system and evidence and force her admission (kinda kidding)", "Before she next visits put a child lock on the socket, one that covers the whole thing. NTA", ">My dad called and said he doesn\u2019t think my mum did this and is upset, although he didn\u2019t seem angry like I\u2019d expected.\n\nThey don't get to stay with you anymore. If you have to build a special licking box or tape a switch up, just don't invite them anymore. Your mom can't keep causing \u00a3500+ in food loss and then shrugging and denying it. NTA. Your mom is an asshole. I don't get the security camera suggestions, your lying mother is not going to care you caught her. \n\n>she compulsively turns switches off at home - kettle, TV, everything accessible). She said no, and suggested it must of happened by accident when I put things on top of the freezer (laundry basket). I accepted this and decided to be more careful but, in doing so, discovered that the basket is too short to hit the switch.\n\nNope. I hate when people screw with stuff at other people's houses. Don't turn things off, don't throw out stuff, don't touch things. You don't know what they are, just leave it alone.", "INFO - why TF do you have a freezer plugged into an outlet so easily deactivated by accident?", "Well you're going to.habe to live with not getting an apology. Id they stay again tape over the switch and put up.a.DO NOT TOUCH notice.", "NTA. I've seen a couple people recommend alarms so you know when the temperature gets too high in the freezer, but you can also get an alarm that sounds if power goes out. They plug into an outlet and contain a battery that powers a buzzer that sounds if the outlet loses power. As soon as the switch is flipped, it will start making noise.\n\nThe one I have is plugged into a duplex outlet (US) that is shared with a refrigerator. I believe UK outlets are controlled individually by the switches, so you would need a power strip, or an alarm designed to allow pass-through power (but I'm not sure these exist).\n\nThe effect would be that as soon as your mother flips the switch, a loud noise starts. She either flips the switch back on, stopping the noise, or it stays on long enough for you to notice. Or she turns the alarm off, confirming malicious intent.", "NTA, did you ask your dad if he did it though?", "YTA. You don't know it was it was her so demanding a ln apology is ridiculous. Maybe you did it and didn't realize it.", "NTA, but what are you going to do about it? You have to decide how much you like your parents and want them around. If you do, it might be easier to just obsessively check the lightswitch every day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, chest freezers stay pretty cold if you don't open them. Obviously a week is too long, but I'd be surprised if the whole freezer spoiled after a day or two.", "It's not usually about the electricity bill, it's about fire. My dad also switches off anything not in use, including the internet! He's never switched off a freezer though. In our parents' youth, electrical equipment was a lot less safe, so they were all taught to switch everything off to prevent fire. He still does it, which is infuriating.", "This! As a blind person I get super pissed when my in-laws come because they turn off all the switches and not being British I often forget to check if it\u2019s off so instead I\u2019ll find myself frustrated wondering why something isn\u2019t working and it\u2019s infuriating! I don\u2019t blame OP for being angry at all, no one has money to throw around right now to replace food.", "There is an asshole here.

If that won't help, they make lock boxes that can be installed over switches.", "Another possible other option would be to put something over the power switch, like a locking box which requires a key.\n\nMust admit I'm confused about the whole turning off a storage freezer by a switch. Never seen one with a power switch before, all the one's I am familiar with are direct plug-in to electrical outlets. Unless you have a switch that turns off the outlet?", "You asking your mother to be self aware and respectful in your home and not mess with stuff when she's ruined tons of food for you, not once but twice isn't being an AH. It's really a lose situation for you and your parents have no consequence but apologizing and not doing it again or saying \"ope don't remember doing it but we'll be more careful next time and watch what we're doing, sorry.\" If that's so upsetting for them that they'd throw a fit or get emotional, maybe the visits should be only to their house.", "So the switch is supposed to be left on at all times? Just remove the switch from the circuit. If the circuit can't be turned off it won't be.\n\nThere is dye called crystal violet, in powder form if it is dusted, *sparingly*, on any surface it's pretty much invisible.  Anyone who touches that surface will have their hands stained deep blue. It's very difficult to remove.", "Can\u2019t you put tape over the switch and a sign \u201cdo not turn off.\u201d", "tape the switch into the correct position! No, it shouldnt happen, but it has twice now. Fool me once, shame on you- fool me twice...?", "Put duct tape over the switch next time so that it can't be turned off.\n\nOr if you really want to go the extra petty mile, don't put tape over the switch, but have a nanny cam pointed at the freezer so you can catch it and show her the footage.", "It's always about the bills these days, plus this is clearly UK, most of our electrical equipment is super super well tested.\n\nI've never heard of a kitchen appliances wiring causing a fire here, unless the problems internally in the wall, in which case thered be no way to tell until the fire started or a fuse goes bang.", "I mean given that OP is saving literal months of food to save time and money, that sucker probably has a crazy good energy efficiency rating.", "I'd get petty, not mention it next time but set up a camera and catch her in the act then demand an apology.", "My mother is the same and I wonder was she on auto pilot so she doesn't remember it? She still responsible but it may explain why she thinks she didn't do it.", "rises\\* ;)", "OP is old enough to own a house and hundreds of pounds of meat. how old would you assume they are?

All of them.", "It's not America.", "Slow down, Jimmy.", "It's unlikely to cause fire now, because of how well tested it is, but back in the 60s you'd buy appliances with no plug attached and you'd have to wire it yourself. My dad is keeping his 1960s attitude when using 2010s-2020s appliances, and it's possible OP's mum is too.", "So to give you a rough idea, I used to do my shopping at a mid-range store and would pay around 120GBP/Month on food for myself. My rent at a student housing (universities own properties and sometimes have their own letting agencies in the UK) cost 500 a month, bills included.", "It\u2019s not inconvenient at all to be honest- you just turn the switch on when you plug something in. \nYou can leave the wall switch turned on if you like, so you can still turn appliances on and off, and you never need to even look at the switch as long as the appliance is switched on. \n\nIt\u2019s more a safety precaution for when there\u2019s nothing plugged into the socket. Some people turn off all the non-essential wall switches each night, for example. I never bother with that, personally. \n\nBuildings built before electricity was commonly available just got wired as necessary over time - if that wasn\u2019t doable, the UK would have ground to a halt a long time ago, given the number of buildings/structures that predate commonly available domestic electricity.", "60 is not elderly by any stretch of the imagination.", "And duct tape that switch on!", "She shouldn\u2019t be visiting full stop.", "That would explain my confusion.\n\nInitially I was think there was a physical on/off switch on the outside of the freezer itself.\n\nHere in the US, electrical outlets for plugs don't have switches directly on them, although sometimes they can be wired to a separate wall switch that controls the power.\n\nThis was more common in older homes (pre 1960's), but rarely found in modern homes.\n\nThanks for the information, didn't even know such a thing existed....", "I assumed that when the OP referenced \"hundreds of pounds\" worth of food.\n\nFigured it was a denomination of currency, not physical weight.", "Yeah, usually the actual reason they do it is because Thatcher privatised all the power and gas companies in the UK in the 80's and prices have been steadily increasing for 40 years to the point pensioners freeze to death all  the time.", "Most outlets in the UK have switches.", "But you wouldn't say \"pounds worth\" for that. Worth = money.", "Hundreds of pounds of meat would be WAY larger than anything short of a walk in freezer", "I feel it more a fear of ...something... more than a safety issue/concern. Outlets with out anything plugged in are not inherently \"unsafe\". The *thing* plugged *might* be \"unsafe\". In modern countries,  I'd imagine there to be an organization tasked to certify the safety of such devices.", "dude, I'm almost 50--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't say geriatric. 60 is absolutely old enough to pickup habits that have to worked around and to be called elderly. 60 is a blink from retired.", "It\u2019s extremely handy.

Hundreds of pounds. A small chest freezer would absolutely hold a few hundred pounds. \ud83d\udcaf.  Easily.", "Not really sure how to respond to that. Hard to quantify all the electrical fires and electrocutions that have been prevented, if they\u2019ve never happened, lol.\n\nI understand why the safety regs for electric here* seem like a LOT to outsiders, but to be fair, I have no problem with it. There are far worse attitudes to have than overcautious. \n\n*the switches are barely the tip of the iceberg, there are multiple measures in place, all of which together significantly reduce risk of fatality caused by the domestic electricity supply.", "The UK is pretty big on traditions. At some point having a switch on the plug was useful, now it's just a habit. The same with having separate taps for hot and cold water. And in older houses, the lights in the bathroom are turned on by pulling on a cord. They are just creatures of habit like that.", "Could definitely see where having that feature would come in handy.", "The cord in the bathroom is also a safety measure- generally no switches that you could touch with your hands in a UK bathroom. So it\u2019s either a cord IN the room or a wall switch outside the room.\n\nThe switch on the plug isn\u2019t a legal requirement but is a safety standard that\u2019s still in use because it still makes sense to have it rather than not.\n\nSeparate taps are also typically an older houses thing. Newer properties I\u2019ve lived in have all had mixer taps. Separate taps are usually just a sign that the owners haven\u2019t had their kitchen redone in quite some time, lol."]}
