He is my oldest sis son. He is the only nephew we have (we are 4 sisters and she is the only one who is married and has a kid). So naturally he is very pampered and looked after. Just for some background, I am a child victim and I have always been conscious about my nephew, the need of protecting him but I have never crossed boundary. \n\nRecently I had a chat with my sis about teaching my nephew regarding good and bad touch and she said that she should but she doesn't know how to. So I asked if I can do it and she said yes. So I took my nephew out for lunch and in between explained to him about good and bad touch. I just explained what it is and who he should go to if it ever happens. I also explained to him about strangers etc. I didn't use any language that would confuse or scare him, I just talked in the simplest way so he should know what it is and what to do if it happens. I also added that anyone could do this, like uncle, aunty, family friends, any cousins, teachers etc and told him that he should never think that \"it's normal\" and that he should tell someone he trusts immediately and should not worry about his parents or us not loving him or believing him because we all love and care for him. He understood everything and I felt more relieved.\n\nHowever that night I got a call from my brother-in-law who was furious. He accused me of grooming his child and not taking his permission before speaking about these things. I said I already asked his wife and she was happy and that I was not grooming his child but saving him from being groomed. He then went on to say that my nephew asked him if his uncle (bro in law's brother) abused him who will he believe. He said I am adding strange ideas in his child's head about going against family and relatives and that I am isolating him from the world. He then went on to say just because it happened to me doesn't mean it will happen to every child. He told me to stay away from my nephew and that I am never allowed to talk to him ever again. I was so mad so I called my sister and she said I thought you were just going to tell him about good and bad touch and none of that \"family is evil\" shit. I told her most of these are from family and that he should be aware of everything. She told me to leave them alone and worry about myself then others. She said if I came by their house or try talking to my nephew they'll call the police and tell them about me grooming their child. \n\nWell my parents said I should not have gotten involved because it's their child but I said I gave a suggestion and then proceeded when I had my sis permission. I have been feeling very down and guilty. I don't think  I have done anything wrong but I can't get what my brother in law said out of my head. I was just trying to protect him. My other sisters backed me up but I still feel very sad. \n\nPlease tell me, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1692094203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rohdf/aita_for_teaching_my_7_year_old_nephew_about_good/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

IF they refuse to follow up, report this to CPS.", "The fact that he asked if he would be believed about the uncle is seriously concerning. Try and stick close to your nephew when the uncle he mentioned is around and show him some self-defense. A well-aimed pinch or kick can do a lot of damage and raise questions as to how the injury occurred.

That's odd.", "NTA. \n\nYou're 100% a large chunk of grooming or inappropriate touch begins with adults children know and trust. It was absolutely the correct thing to specify to a child that bad touch is bad no matter who it comes from. \n\n*But* I don't think this was a conversation you should have had with your nephew solo. A parent should have been present as well. They know their child best and how to explain things and it would have been best for them to have all the context of what you specifically said so that they can answer the kiddo's questions. \n\nI do think your sister and BIL are blowing this out of proportion and it is on your sister for not informing BIL of the convo ahead of time.", "NTA \n\nMost child abuse takes place within the family circle.", "Big NTA\nYou fulfilled your role as a loving aunt. And it's a fact, more than 80% children are abused by people they know. You took permission and taught the child what was right. You should not feel guilty of anything at all, and that child is lucky that he has at least you to talk to if God forbids anything happens. His parents can't understand that the world is not a good place and you can do nothing about it.", "You asked for permission, she said yes, and you gave your insight.  Why that\u2019s a problem is beyond me.\n\nNTA and maybe mention something to CPS about the uncle.", "Probably a conversation you could have initiated with your nephew WITH their parents present", "NTA based on what you wrote. Sorry for you predicament.", "NAH. You were definitely working with the best of intentions and with the best for your nephew at heart. So you're not an asshole.\n\nHowever, you may be a little bit na\u00efve. This shouldn't really have been your job to do and the fact that the father didn't know you were going to do it was a bit of a misstep. As others have pointed out, having both parents informed and at least one present would have been more appropriate. I'm also concerned about your nephew talking about his uncle. Is there any chance you may have mentioned male relatives as possible bad touchers? If you interrogate your memory and you are pretty sure that you never said anything that could indicate that the uncle could be doing bad touching, please act as quickly as you can to support your nephew to make a complaint. I know they're saying that you can't see him any more, but you may be able to persuade your mother to help.", "I'm going with ESH.\n\nThis is not a conversation you should have had alone with the kid. Both parents should have been consulted, present and participating in this conversation.\n\nHow would you react if you came home and find out that someone had that kind of conversation with your kid and you had no idea what exactly what said, especially now that the kid is saying that something may have happened. I understand why he's pissed about this. \n\nBut what's the most worrisome thing here is that now there's at least 5 adults (you, your sister, your BIL, and your parents) who know about what the kid said about his uncle and nobody is doing shit about it.", "ESH\n\nThis is so bizarre & was most definitely not a conversation to have without this kid\u2019s parents. It\u2019s also not a one time conversation. Naming & discussing body parts. Explaining safe or unsafe behavior. Answering questions. Should all be done with a parent ... at the very least in the same room with the kid. Now this 7 yo is the reporter of this conversation. The parents have no clue what was actually explained to him or what to believe. \n\nYou just glossed over a statement regarding Uncle. Is anyone concerned about this? Has the kid ever even been alone with his uncle? He needs to be seen by his pediatrician. Who knows what you told this kid & what he actually heard .... what a mess.", "ESH. Right action, wrong person. You\u2019re 100% right that someone\u2019s needed to tell him about things like this. But, you were probably not the right person to do it. Even if you did and said everything perfectly any scrutiny falls back on you and given your history it puts the belief in their head you might have said something wrong because of what happened to you.", "ESH Your sister never should have put this responsibility on you. She should have sat down with her husband and come up with their own plan. You should have discussed what you were going to say to your nephew with his parents before having this talk. In the end while I know you had your nephew's best interest at heart this was not your conversation to have. You should have instead coached your sister on how to approach the conversation with her kid and let them do it.", "We can't know if anything you said might have riled the child up in some way, but given your experience with the subject matter, I'm inclined to believe you took care to explain things carefully and clearly. Just makes me think that your talk with him came at the exact right time, and was sorely needed! NTA. I'm so sorry, I hope they come around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Most of the time at least one family member will experience a situation like that.", "> things like this don\u2019t just get said by 7 year olds.\n\nThey very much do. I wouldn't be surprised if this was the kid testing what he'd been told - \"You'd definitely believe me, even if it was Uncle Bob? Even Santa?\" Given dad's reaction, he was right to check.\n\n*That said*, I would also be very very wary of the uncle and would agree that professional help is the way to go here.", "They definitely do. BUT I would still ask deeper questions like how'd you choose the person to ask about. Something that isn't leading. It can get tricky but some probing needs to happen.", "They want to avoid anyone finding out about the thing with the uncle, because they would rather avoid the shame than protect their kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA good parent would have made the kid feel safe and ASKED for more information.

Yeah, we've had our eye on the guy for a while now but he always ends up slipping away somehow.", "YES!

Their brains process in ways which don't entirely make sense to an adult, and sometimes they don't know how to test an idea out without doing the thing, if that makes sense. Somebody who is having a legal investigation into them because the nephew they honestly love just accused them of sex crimes is going to be outraged and very angry. \n\nAnother reason to take this seriously is that kids brains can be sideways - believing him and looking into Uncle Bob, who is innocent, may be enough to get him to open up about Preacher Steve, who isn't. \n\nAnd if the adults in the room treat this with appropriate caution - they act like this is a check, just in case, because it put the hairs on my neck up too! - then they're more likely to be willing to look into it again next time.", "The uncle is OPs sisters brother-in-law.
