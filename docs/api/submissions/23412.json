This was way waaaay too early to do the \"meet the girlfriend thing\". Two months is not enough. I met my step dad around that length of time into the relationship. I was 14 and I swear I didn't warm up to the guy until I was in my mid 20s. \n2. Your daughter is obese and this line of thinking is dangerous:\n\n>Its a sensitive area, we don't discuss it\n\nYou should be discussing it. Weight isn't a taboo, it's a serious factor associated with health. It can affect fertility, heart and lung function, liver function, mobility, immune system. Its not just a number on the scale or a clothing size, it's a really important thing that you need to be actively on top of. Whether that's diet/exercise, motivating her and learning healthy cooking methods, or looking at medical tests to make sure there's no underlying condition.  \n\nOkay, girlfriend could've been a bit more tactful but ultimately she's trying to give you a wake-up call here:\n\n>Once she asked me how much fatter I was going to allow my daughter to get, I was done.

She may have a medical condition (e.g., thyroid problems, PCOS) that is causing this issue.  There may be some trauma, perhaps around the loss of her mother, that is unaddressed and would be helped by counseling.\n\nYour girlfriend is right that if your reaction to this situation is to call it sensitive and not talk about it, you aren't actually handling the problem, you're ignoring it.\n\nFor example, if she has PCOS, there are medications that are very effective. Birth control pills, to keep more cysts from forming, spironolactone addresses the excess testosterone, and metformin can help control blood sugar, insulin resistance and weight gain associated with the condition. There are other medications that can help, as well.\n\nIf she has a thyroid problem, there are both treatments for if it is overactive, and thyroid hormone supplements to make up the deficiency if it is under-active.\n\nNeither of these conditions are life-threatening, but both can negatively impact quality of life.\n\nYou do need to get your head out of the sand on this, and get your daughter real help.\n\nETA - Your girlfriend's over-stepping is a less serious AH issue than you ignoring your daughter's medical care.\n\nAnd once you made it clear that your way of \"dealing with\" this problem is \"it's sensitive, so we don't talk about it\" your girlfriend was absolutely right to call you out on this neglect of your daughter's medical needs, for your daughter's sake.  It seems no one else is.\n\nAnd your girlfriend had the good sense to bring this up in private to you, not to discuss it where your daughter might overhear.  That goes a long way towards mitigating the over-stepping.\n\nETA2: Also, you say that you saw your girlfriend looked concerned, but when you asked about it, she didn't want to speak.  You pushed the matter.  That really mitigates her speaking.  She knew it was over-stepping, so she wasn't going to say anything, but you insisted.  It is not her fault you didn't like what she had to say.  So I'm switching this up to a YTA, since she only spoke when you pushed the issue.\n\nHer concerns are genuine, and reasonable.

There's an enormous body of work showing that [fat shaming makes fat people sicker and causes them to gain more weight](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6565398/). It causes them to develop eating disorders and most scary of all, to not go to doctors because they know they're going to be shamed and told it's a weight problem rather than having their symptoms taken seriously. There's also a lot of evidence that dieting *doesn't work*, and is [extremely harmful to make children and adolescents go through especially.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720870/) The risks to their lifelong ability to have a healthy relationship with their food, their risk of developing eating disorders, and their risk of weight cycling (which is extremely unhealthy and stressful for bodies to go through and can cause as much damage to major organs as just being fat can) all go way, way up and are much more dangerous than just... being fat.   \n\n\nIf OP wants to in a non-shaming way talk with his daughter about if she wants to see a doctor or feels like something doesn't feel right with her body, great. I'm all for that. I think teens of all sizes should be taken to doctors and taken seriously if they feel like they might have something going on with their bodies. But treating her like she's diseased or disgusting or sticking her on a diet is not going to help. It will not help even if I or a doctor could look into a crystal ball and know with 110% certainty that staying this weight will make her develop diabetes or heart disease. It will not make her lose weight. It is more likely to make her gain weight. Even if I agreed with you that it's for sure a problem (and without knowing about her full medical history and lifestyle  and/or going to medical school, I don't and neither does anyone else in this sub for that matter), body shame is not the answer. It is never, ever the answer.", "I tried getting her to exercise", "What do you know about helping teenagers lose weight? Probably nothing based on what you\u2019ve said here", "well, the uniform from last year doesn't fit so that was 100% needed, and, I did make attempts to get her up and moving, she hated it", "Lol it\u2019s my \u201cbusiness\u201d same way it\u2019s yours- the guy posted here asking for comments. I also don\u2019t need to be a doctor or even play one on TV to know being that heavy at 16 isn\u2019t good, and that if the issue isn\u2019t addressed, it will only get worse, harder to reverse, and health/social issues will get harder.", "And? My first comment was in reference to that my second was directed to your Fat-phobic remarks.", "Have you seen my 600 pound life?!! If not, please do! \nSo you can stop with your excuses, and start helping your daughter!", "How terribly inconvenient for you.", "The gf asked how much fatter OP was going to allow the daughter to get. I just feel like that is a really abrasive thing to say about someone's daughter.", "May I commend you for getting your daughter a uniform that will fit instead of allowing her to be embarrassed when she tries to go to school. If you would like to discuss or get some input on how to help your daughter, contact me privately. As I mentioned in my answer, I have lived this portion of your daughters life. I weighed 190 and was only 5 feet tall  when I graduated from high school at my largest I was over 400. I understand the difficulty of a father addressing this with a daughter and I have some thoughts that don\u2019t seem relevant in this forum. However, I am willing to discuss my experience and my losing more than 200 pounds and maintaining that weight  loss if it might help your daughter. \n\nfor all the people who say just go lose weight, know this: less than 10% of people who seek to lose weight can maintain more than 10 pounds of weight loss over five years. That means there is a 90% failure rate. Is there any other medical issue where there\u2019s a 90% failure rate and yet you would tell people to go out and try the solutions that are offered, I don\u2019t think so. Especially if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s never struggled with significant weight issues. Don\u2019t try to give advice to someone who has a significant amount of weight to lose and by significant. I mean over 100 pounds plus. Your 10 to 15 pounds is nothing to what we deal with.", "she's not going to be 600 pounds", "Yeah, it's abrasive.  But he also says that she tried to avoid saying anything, but that he pushed her to speak when she looked like she was biting her tongue to avoid bringing up anything.\n\nHe can't have it both ways, pushing her to speak, when she's hesitant to, then getting mad when he doesn't like what she had to say.", "She could've worded it better. That is true and you're right about it. But the fact that dad should do something still remains. Forget gf, the important one here is daughter.", "The uniform thing had to happen, she couldn't get the pants buttoned", "She\u2019s tracking for 300, and believe me that\u2019s plenty enough to be a life ruiner.", "100% this! The important one here is the daughter. Absolutely.", "she's not going to get to 300 either", "I love your optimism, but what are you doing to prevent that? If you won\u2019t even talk about the fact that she is obese, how will you prevent her from continuing to gain weight? You really should see her pediatrician"]}
