I've been around here for long time but opened a new account to be able to open this post freely.\r  \n\r  \nI would first like to mention the dynamic of our relationship. \n\nI (29m) have been together with my gf (28f) for about 4 months. Although it's a new relationship, we kind of moved fast to make future plans. She is a very beautiful, clever girl and has a good job too. But moving that fast makes me a bit nervous. She is continuously mentioning her \u201cbiological clock\u201d and wants to have child before 30. She seems very into me and the sex is very good. She also wants me to move together with her and we had lots of discussions because of this. \r  \n\r  \nSince we started to date, I have been paying for everything. And when I say everything, I mean everything. Even the small ice cream treatment after a nice dinner should be on me, apparently just because I am a man. When we go to market to buy ingredients to cook in her place, again I pay for everything. She likes gifts and receiving roses. One time she even mentioned what she wants and asked me to buy it, I bought it after a month. But during one of our discussions, she mentioned that I bought it very late.\r  \n\r  \nHere I should mention that I am not a very rich guy. I just moved to a new country 1.5 years ago, have a nice job, am doing okay but not rich. She earns around the same too probably but she also has much more secured job. I love treating her with dinners and gifts, giving her ride to everywhere. But sometimes I also think it would be nice if at least she offers something. Not that I would definitely accept, but at least ask.\r  \n\r  \nWe were talking about a summer vacation together in the relatively expensive part of Europe since the very beginning of the relationship. Last week I did all the planning for this 2 weeks holiday and explained her. Then I said \u201cwe should make a budget together and I hope it\u2019s okay for you to share some of the expenses for our vacation.\u201d I was thinking like I will bear all the transportation cost, and we will share the hotel and food expenses there. But she strongly opposed and said:\r  \n\u201cAre you going to share the expenses of my outfits, pay for my face treatments, my hair, my nails\u2026\u201d\r  \n\u201cI put lots of money to look beautiful beside you and should I pay my own trip too\u2026\u201d\r  \n\u201cSome guys want a beautiful girl but complain about the minimal effort they have to put... \u201d\r  \n\u201cIf you expect me to pay for my own trip then I don\u2019t see you as boyfriend but as a friend, that\u2019s a natural reaction...\u201d\r  \n\u201cAs long as you pay 0 to my monthly woman expenses you have nothing to say\u2026\u201d\r  \n\u201cShould I bring flowers to you the next time..?\u201d\r  \nAnd many more.\r  \n\r  \nShe also told that we could shorten the holiday and go somewhere else if it's expensive for me, but strongly opposing to contribute because of these reasons.\r  \n\r\r", "created_utc": 1686307611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1451w1k/aita_for_asking_my_so_to_share_some_of_the/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's only been 4 months, and she is already showing you she's only with you because you buy her things, don't be a mug.", "oh god... run. NTA clearly. At first I was thinking why on earth is she talking about having children after 4 month into the relationship but not about things like your future finances, housing situation, meeting your parents etc. And then you hit me with that outrageous and entitled conversation. \n\nThis woman is not right in her mind. What would she say if you told her that if she does her hair, nails, buy expensive outfits just for you, would you have a say in it then? Like what if you chose to ask her not to do her nails anymore? would she stop doing it if by her logic she's doing it for you and you don't want it? I'm not sure in what country this is happenning but it's not normal. \n\nYou clearly have different views on life and it won't work out for you. In a healthy relationship everybody at least tries to contribute 50/50 or make up where they can't with other things. Or what if you lose your job, will she simply dump you because of that? Life is not always easy and god forbid something bad happens and you fall ill and can't work and she has to care for you, will she do it or just leave you? Just tell her that unfortunately you don't see a future together with her.

Say \"bye\" and find someone who is not narcissistic, a manipulater, or stuck in an old paradigm. Someone who wants to be a partner.

YTA if you continue this relationship.", "NTA - But you need to have an open conversation about this and let her know that you are not willing to be in a situation in which you are expected to pay for everything.  My wife and I have been together for over 20 years.  Currently I earn about 60% of the household income.  So we split the costs 60/40 on everything.  The mortgage, groceries, vacation expenses, etc.  If her expectation is an expectation that is contrary to your own and you do not like...then it needs to be addressed.  And if that causes a breakup, well it's better that you find that out now rather than several years down the road once you've had children and your finances are intertwined.  You've only got one life bro....don't agree to anything that is going to cause you to spend years unhappy.", "Huge red flag you need to end this relationship. She is going to manipulate and control you for every dollar she can. While you are struggling to pay for things she is going to be living \u201cthe good life\u201d.

She\u2019s looking for a guy to take care of her an spoil her to her liking. It\u2019s absolutely reasonable to ask her to share the vacation expenses!! Unless you\u2019re willing to foot the bill for everything with her and cater to all her wants, I suggest breaking it off. And do not have a child with this woman, at least yet, but if ever. You\u2019ll be trapped and stuck with her for the next 18 years bending to her every whim.", "Boy, you better run! Far away and fast!\n\nits not that expensive to take care of yourself as a woman, at least not that much, that you should pay for the whole two week vacay. \nexcept you specifically ask her to get nails and hair done and wear expensive clothes, then its on you. but i dont think this is the case. \n\nif you are looking for a serious relationship between equals, move on. this woman is beyond entitled and it will not stop. and do not have unprotected sex with her watch for your condoms, i think shes the type to put holes in condoms.", "NTA but dude, get away from her", "Nta.\n\nBut.... RED FLAG CITY!!! Run johnny, run! \n\nPaying for meals or trinkets isn't a big deal, but Princess needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her.", "NTA, but out of curiosity: do you expect her to use expensive beauty products to \"look beautiful beside you\"?", "Nta.  Run forest.... run!", "NTA. She is using you. Find a new girlfriend.", "You got yourself a sugar baby! If you love her and can afford her, she\u00b4ll stick around\n\nAre you paying for her outfits, hair, nails etc or is that her argument for not sharing expenses; that her beauty expenses are equivalent to what you pay for hotel and food? \n\nNTA for asking but if you want her around you are gonna have to pay", "NTA unfortunately I feel she\u2019s possibly using you , as a sugar daddy, and some serious communication is in order obviously. \n\nBest of luck!", "Maybe it's a cultural difference, but I think he's taking advantage of you. You invite her to things or give her gifts when you go out? That's great! Her throwing it in your face that you didn't buy her something she asked for on time? What kind of power does she think she has over you? Forcing you to pay for everything in the 2 weeks of vacation? No no no! And then she manipulates you to make you feel guilty?\n\nNTA . Ask yourself if you want this situation to become your reality for the rest of your life. \n\nP.S.: Although not typical, it is totally ok for a woman to give her partner flowers (or other gifts).", "She\u2019s using you, OP.  Gold digger.  NTA and pull that escape ripcord.", "NTA  Run.", "NTA but you guys want two different types of relationships. \n\nShe wants a traditional relationship and you do not. Traditional relationships when not married can be trickier but still possible but in all reality it sounds like you want a more independent woman and that\u2019s okay. She\u2019s just probably not the woman for you.", "NTA. She's using you as a sugar daddy.", "I'm not saying she's right, but she does have a right to demand what she wants in a relationship. There are men out there that actually like women to rely on them completely. And if she's beautiful and good at sex, I guess she would get one pretty easily.\n\nSo if you don't want this to be your life, you better break up before she gets pregnant.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She'll focus her attention to the child, and the bond between you two will see less attention.  That is normal; but, if there wasn't a great foundation between the two of you to start, odds are good it won't get a lot better with less attention, especially in a relationship where there is lots of \"yours\" and \"mine\".\n\nThis is the fancy way of saying, you're not a equal, just an means to an end.

They definitely want different things out of a relationship. \n\nYou also say he wants a \u201cnormal relationship\u201d but what some view as normal is weird to others.

Maybe \"typical\" is the better word? I honestly have no moral issue with what some folks call a traditional relationship or even a sugar baby/sugar daddy deal as long as everyone consents and knows what they're signing up for.

I think communicating the type of relationship you want early on in dating like first few dates is so key. It can really help create a foundation for a relationship."]}
