I've been around here for long time but opened a new account to be able to open this post freely.\n\nI would first like to mention the dynamic of our relationship.\n\nI (29m) have been together with my gf (28f) for about 4 months. Although it's a new relationship, we kind of moved fast to make future plans. She is a very beautiful, clever girl and has a good job too. But moving that fast makes me a bit nervous. She is continuously mentioning her \u201cbiological clock\u201d and wants to have child before 30. She seems very into me and the sex is very good. She also wants me to move together with her and we had lots of discussions because of this.\n\nSince we started to date, I have been paying for everything. And when I say everything, I mean everything. Even the small ice cream treatment after a nice dinner should be on me, apparently just because I am a man. When we go to market to buy ingredients to cook in her place, again I pay for everything. She likes gifts and receiving roses. One time she even mentioned what she wants and asked me to buy it, I bought it after a month. But during one of our discussions, she mentioned that I bought it very late.\n\nHere I should mention that I am not a very rich guy. I just moved to a new country 1.5 years ago, have a nice job, am doing okay but not rich. She earns around the same too probably but she also has much more secured job. I love treating her with dinners and gifts, giving her ride to everywhere. But sometimes I also think it would be nice if at least she offers something. Not that I would definitely accept, but at least ask.\n\nWe were talking about a summer vacation together in the relatively expensive part of Europe since the very beginning of the relationship. Last week I did all the planning for this 2 weeks holiday and explained her. Then I said \u201cwe should make a budget together and I hope it\u2019s okay for you to share some of the expenses for our vacation.\u201d I was thinking like I will bear all the transportation cost, and we will share the hotel and food expenses there. But she strongly opposed and said:\n\n\u201cAre you going to share the expenses of my outfits, pay for my face treatments, my hair, my nails\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI put lots of money to look beautiful beside you and should I pay my own trip too\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSome guys want a beautiful girl but complain about the minimal effort they have to put... \u201d\n\n\u201cIf you expect me to pay for my own trip then I don\u2019t see you as boyfriend but as a friend, that\u2019s a natural reaction...\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as you pay 0 to my monthly woman expenses you have nothing to say\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cShould I bring flowers to you the next time..?\u201d\n\nAnd many more.\n\nShe also told that we could shorten the holiday and go somewhere else if it's expensive for me, but strongly opposing to contribute because of these reasons.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the comments people! Btw, I already dumped her yesterday. But she came over to my place in the evening and told me how much she loves me and so on, then tried to seduce with intimacy. I played along, but I also said we will talk in the weekend. In the meantime I wanted to ask you people here, and I see that indeed I did not do anything wrong, so tomorrow I will finish this.\n\nEDIT2: The \"intimacy\" I mentioned in EDIT1 is not usual kind of sex intimacy, she is already in her period so no risk of pregnancy.", "created_utc": 1686307611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1451w1k/aita_for_asking_my_so_to_share_some_of_the/", "score": 454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Make sure you are using a condom!", "Mate, honestly, she's taking you for a ride. Walk away now. Otherwise, she's going bleed you dry. It's only been 4 months, and she is already showing you she's only with you because you buy her things, don't be a mug.", "oh god... run. NTA clearly. At first I was thinking why on earth is she talking about having children after 4 month into the relationship but not about things like your future finances, housing situation, meeting your parents etc. And then you hit me with that outrageous and entitled conversation. \n\nThis woman is not right in her mind. What would she say if you told her that if she does her hair, nails, buy expensive outfits just for you, would you have a say in it then? Like what if you chose to ask her not to do her nails anymore? would she stop doing it if by her logic she's doing it for you and you don't want it? I'm not sure in what country this is happenning but it's not normal. \n\nYou clearly have different views on life and it won't work out for you. In a healthy relationship everybody at least tries to contribute 50/50 or make up where they can't with other things. Or what if you lose your job, will she simply dump you because of that? Life is not always easy and god forbid something bad happens and you fall ill and can't work and she has to care for you, will she do it or just leave you? Just tell her that unfortunately you don't see a future together with her.

Say \"bye\" and find someone who is not narcissistic, a manipulater, or stuck in an old paradigm. Someone who wants to be a partner.

YTA if you continue this relationship.", "NTA - But you need to have an open conversation about this and let her know that you are not willing to be in a situation in which you are expected to pay for everything.  My wife and I have been together for over 20 years.  Currently I earn about 60% of the household income.  So we split the costs 60/40 on everything.  The mortgage, groceries, vacation expenses, etc.  If her expectation is an expectation that is contrary to your own and you do not like...then it needs to be addressed.  And if that causes a breakup, well it's better that you find that out now rather than several years down the road once you've had children and your finances are intertwined.  You've only got one life bro....don't agree to anything that is going to cause you to spend years unhappy.", "Huge red flag you need to end this relationship. She is going to manipulate and control you for every dollar she can. While you are struggling to pay for things she is going to be living \u201cthe good life\u201d.

She\u2019s looking for a guy to take care of her an spoil her to her liking. It\u2019s absolutely reasonable to ask her to share the vacation expenses!! Unless you\u2019re willing to foot the bill for everything with her and cater to all her wants, I suggest breaking it off. And do not have a child with this woman, at least yet, but if ever. You\u2019ll be trapped and stuck with her for the next 18 years bending to her every whim.", "Boy, you better run! Far away and fast!\n\nits not that expensive to take care of yourself as a woman, at least not that much, that you should pay for the whole two week vacay. \nexcept you specifically ask her to get nails and hair done and wear expensive clothes, then its on you. but i dont think this is the case. \n\nif you are looking for a serious relationship between equals, move on. this woman is beyond entitled and it will not stop. and do not have unprotected sex with her watch for your condoms, i think shes the type to put holes in condoms.", "NTA but dude, get away from her", "Nta.\n\nBut.... RED FLAG CITY!!! Run johnny, run! \n\nPaying for meals or trinkets isn't a big deal, but Princess needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her.", "NTA, but out of curiosity: do you expect her to use expensive beauty products to \"look beautiful beside you\"?", "Nta.  Run forest.... run!", "NTA. She is using you. Find a new girlfriend.", "You got yourself a sugar baby! If you love her and can afford her, she\u00b4ll stick around\n\nAre you paying for her outfits, hair, nails etc or is that her argument for not sharing expenses; that her beauty expenses are equivalent to what you pay for hotel and food? \n\nNTA for asking but if you want her around you are gonna have to pay", "NTA unfortunately I feel she\u2019s possibly using you , as a sugar daddy, and some serious communication is in order obviously. \n\nBest of luck!", "Maybe it's a cultural difference, but I think he's taking advantage of you. You invite her to things or give her gifts when you go out? That's great! Her throwing it in your face that you didn't buy her something she asked for on time? What kind of power does she think she has over you? Forcing you to pay for everything in the 2 weeks of vacation? No no no! And then she manipulates you to make you feel guilty?\n\nNTA . Ask yourself if you want this situation to become your reality for the rest of your life. \n\nP.S.: Although not typical, it is totally ok for a woman to give her partner flowers (or other gifts).", "She\u2019s using you, OP.  Gold digger.  NTA and pull that escape ripcord.", "NTA  Run.", "NTA but you guys want two different types of relationships. \n\nShe wants a traditional relationship and you do not. Traditional relationships when not married can be trickier but still possible but in all reality it sounds like you want a more independent woman and that\u2019s okay. She\u2019s just probably not the woman for you.", "NTA. She's using you as a sugar daddy.", "I'm not saying she's right, but she does have a right to demand what she wants in a relationship. There are men out there that actually like women to rely on them completely. And if she's beautiful and good at sex, I guess she would get one pretty easily.\n\nSo if you don't want this to be your life, you better break up before she gets pregnant.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She'll focus her attention to the child, and the bond between you two will see less attention.

I'd find a new girlfriend.", "Hey OP, I'm sure that you won't see this in time, but I really want you to give her three last gifts - a shovel, a pickaxe, and a miner's helmet.\n\nThen explain she can use those tools to dig for gold elsewhere.\n\nNTA", "Don\u2019t count on her period being a safe time to have sex. It\u2019s rare, but women can get pregnant at that time (stranger things have happened), and that\u2019s assuming she\u2019s telling the truth that she\u2019s on her period.", "Don\u2019t count on her period being a safe time to have sex. It\u2019s rare, but women can get pregnant at that time (stranger things have happened), and that\u2019s assuming she\u2019s telling the truth that she\u2019s on her period.", "NTA. Reading your descriptions of the gold digger stuff she says made me cringe hard. I'm not sure why you would want to be in a relationship where you are so much lower in status. Remember if you are looking up to her she is looking down on you. Reclaim your self respect bro.", "Ewww toxic femininity. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever known someone like this out in the wild but it\u2019s gross.", "NTA. \n\nWhat happens if you marry her? Will your money be hers AND her money be hers? Will she split house bills? Contribute to savings? Contribute to child expenses? Or would she expect you to front it all while her money is hers to do whatever she wants? Sounds like she wants a sugar daddy, not a partner to build a life with. You guys are not financially compatible, and most of divorces happen due to financial disagreements so don't trick yourself into thinking she'll change and fall into a trap. \n\nSpeaking of trap, she sounds like she's trying to baby trap you. I'd avoid getting my penis anywhere near her if I were you.\n\nAnd lastly, sounds like you have a different timeline in mind than she does. Another reason you're not compatible. Unless you're willing to pay for everything forever, move in, get married, and have a baby within 2 years, I say walk away now and don't waste your time or her time.", "Relationships are give and take. If you're the only one giving, you take yourself from that situation.", "hmm. \"biological clock\" paired with the context you provided sounds a lot like what kanye was digging at.\n\nonce you give her that child, be prepared to give her half your income and your home as well.", "What? I make a third of what my husband does and I still contribute to our life.", "NTA. Glad to read that you dumped her. Moving fast is always such a big red flag that ppl should pay attention to. It's not even like 30 is that old for children. Barring some unforseen fertility issue, her ability to bear children will be affected just cuz she's 30 instead of 29", "Dude, she\u2019s not looking for a boyfriend, she wants a sugar daddy. Bail now before it\u2019s too late.", "NTA\nThat update made me so happy", "NTA. I\u2019d say goodbye to her. She\u2019s very materialistic. You want a true partner in everything including finances.", "Run.", "Nta. RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!", "HUGE RED FLAG!!!! This girl does not see you as a man. She sees you as her walking atm. There is no love there. It sounds like for her, this is a transaction. I would suggest putting your wallet away and finding an equal partner. Because that one only wants your money. NTA and be smart or she will take all your money and run.", "NTA. Glad you dumped her. She was only with you for for money.", "Dude.\n\n>  But moving that fast makes me a bit nervous. She is continuously mentioning her \u201cbiological clock\u201d and wants to have child before 30. \n\nSo she's pressuring you into sex and fathering a child, \n\n> I have been paying for everything\n\nwhile mooching off of you.\n\nCan we say 'baby trap?'", "NTA. \n\nBrother, LEAVE. She is only with you for the money, using you as her bank account while she saves up and spends all the money she doesn't have contribute.", "NTA , you deserve better dude", "NTA - I 100% guarantee she's a \"strong, independent woman\" \ud83e\udd23", "NTA but bro this is some huge red flags. I would get the fuck out now.", "Dude she sounds like a sponsor kid,\n\nI'd walk you treat her well you deserve someone who returns the favour", "I just love when you're halfway down an AITA post and you can almost -taste- the first comment on your tongue. \n\nI knew it would be here.", "YOU CAN STILL GET PREGNANT EVEN ON YOUR PERIOD! Do not be fooled!", "18 years. 18 years. She got one of yo kids, go you for 18 years. \n\nAnd on her 18th birthday, he found out it wasn\u2019t his", "She\u2019s basically an expensive prostitute", "This is why men should be equally in charge of birth control. Not saying OP is like this, but it generally gets treated like the woman's responsibility. Obviously that gets the job down if you have a trustworthy partner, but it leaves men so vulnerable for getting baby trapped", "Just so you know, everyone's fertile period is different. So if you're going based on average women you might actually be hitting her peak time for fertility. And sperm can live in the body for 5 days. My peak days are 5 days sooner than the average woman.\n\nIf you're going based on what SHE says her fertile days are... \ud83d\ude2c", "Is she Slavic?", "Soooo she's  basically forcing you into hiring her to be your gf \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\udee1 oh my my my .....\n\nEta spelling correction"]}
