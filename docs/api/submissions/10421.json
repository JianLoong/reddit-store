We have a two week old baby. \n\nFor the past 3 years MIL has been harassing about us having baby, even went as far as giving me baby names and demanding I use them.  She is a huge control freak. My SIL has 2 kids, with names MIL helped pick out with MIL planning her gender reveal and baby shower, she commented on everything SIL did pregnant.Along with that MIL doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough for her son. She didn\u2019t originally want us marrying, and I miscarried 2 years into our relationship and MIL made comments to SIL about me probably faking it to \u201ckeep him around.\u201d \n\nWhen I first started showing, I mostly just looked chubby and bloated. MIL says \u201coh god you aren\u2019t pregnant are you? Your just gaining weight?\u201d that was the moment we decided to keep this a secret. She has warmed up to me  since the marriage but still makes comments here and there, her moods are everywhere. SIL also agreed to keep it a secret because they also know how her mother is. We planned to have a babyshower after the baby was born, as more of a celebration of the baby being born and basically just a list of anything we didn\u2019t have or have much of, which MIL would be invited too.\n\nWell I gave birth, and we waited 2 weeks so she didn\u2019t want to come over instantly, we wanted time to come home and get adjusted first and have our private time with the baby. We finally called her over and told her we had a surprise for her. She came and was instantly angry, she said we were spiteful and selfish and it was horrible she had no part in this. That this was definitely a move of mine and I was brainwashing her son. We even told her we hadn\u2019t yet had the shower so really didn\u2019t miss out on much but she left. Later on that night she texted my husband saying to have her come over when I\u2019m running errands or not home to see the baby and said she\u2019d be a free babysitter whenever we needed when I go back to work.\n\nI feel bad for keeping this from her, but she takes everything too far and controls and degrades. \n\nInfo: My husband is on my side in this. He always stands up for me or tells his mom to knock it off.", "created_utc": 1676865475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116x25b/aita_for_hiding_my_pregnancy_from_mil_til_after/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be prepared to support each other bc you need to set a LOT of boundaries!", "NTA - your body, your kid, your rules but I have to ask, where if your husband in this? Does he actively shut down his mom's bullshit? I hope so, but if not, this is a good time to make sure he has a spine so she doesn't just end up at your house all the time behind your back.", "NTA she's just mad she couldn't control everything. I hope you didn't use any of the names she previously suggested. Also, I hope husband is in your side and won't call her when you're gone.", "You had the support of SIL in this decision and I have to believe if SIL thought it was wrong, she\u2019d \u201caccidentally\u201d have let it slip. So I would say NTA\n\nBut the need for some serious boundaries is just beginning\u2026 big hugs and stay strong as a united front", "NTA and she clearly will get over it if she wants to see her grandchildren. This likely saved you a ton of stress during your pregnancy so you absolutely made the right call. She is going to make this about her and would have made the pregnancy about her as well. You should tell your husband that she needs to contact you both about sitting the baby. Not just him. She will hate it, but have him tell her that\u2019s just how it has to be so you both are in on the plans.", "NTA\n\nSpecifically because of your miscarriage and her comments at that time. The fear of losing another baby and being mocked for it justifies the extreme action of hiding your pregnancy from your husband's mother.", "NTA but I wouldn't let her around the kid. Toxicity is off the charts with MiL", "NTA. I'm glad that you and your husband are presented a united front.", "When someone is as problematic as MIL you need to treat them differently. It\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s a response to their awfulness. Keep people like this at arms length, it\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll stay sane. NTA", "Move to another state. Congrats on the kid and wish you the best.", "NTA\n\nShe already had her kids, she doesn't need to control everyone else's kids because hers are grown up and have their own lives.\n\nIt sounds like she wanted to marry him off to a mini her and got mad because she got a rebel.", "If i were in your shoes, I wouldn\u2019t trust her unsupervised around my kid at the time simply because it\u2019s partially me. I wouldnt know what to do if one moment she sees too much of me in the baby and forget it\u2019s her grand baby and acts out. \n\nI also dont think you\u2019re the ah for keeping it from her. Would she maybe have been excited for you all? Who knows. But there are consequences for peoples actions. She already made it known that she doesnt think you\u2019re a good fit and didnt want you to be pregnant. So if you did tell her then what? You\u2019d of possibly dealt with her guilt tripping or talking negative about you throughout the pregnancy? She\u2019s honestly probably an added stressor that could have had negative impact on your pregnancy. \n\nYou did what was right for you and your family. Not just that, you made an informed and collective decision. It was not as an individual.", "Nta, buy I honestly would go completely NC with her. She has no respect for you and sounds like a vile woman", "NTA and good for you! Your MIL has proved that she can't be trusted not to try to control you. After all, she did it to your SIL, and she presumably *likes* your SIL. MIL absolutely would have harassed you and made your entire pregnancy miserable with her demands. She's positively livid that you didn't allow her to control you. \n\nThis stranger on the internet is proud of you for setting and sticking to a boundary!", "Big nta, I'm glad your husband is with you on this. Must be hard for him too", "NTA. Make sure she doesn\u2019t have a key to your house and install cameras. I hope this doesn\u2019t become another episode of \u201cMIL Tried to Steal My Baby.\u201d\n\nBut honestly, if you had to go to such extreme lengths to hide one of the happiest times of your life, is this really someone you want around your baby when you\u2019re not around? Does MIL think she can dictate when she gets to see your child?", "NTA - You did beautifully, congrats on the little one", "NTA\n\nSomeone needs to sit her down and explain that all this was 100% on her. Not only that, but she needs to be told that in no uncertain terms, she will not be in that child's life if she continues to treat you like this. Boundaries need to bet set and stuck to. She's only going to continue to pull this shit if no one does anything to stop her.", "NTA\n\nIt is your right to tell her you are pregnant and let her around your kid but honestly, what kind of outcome were you expecting? She was just going to jump for joy at this surprise baby?\n\nNot AH territory but dumb, for sure.", "NTA but I don\u2019t know where things go from here either. Something tells me your MIL isn\u2019t one to let go of a grudge.", "NTA! Good on you", "NTA\n\n>  We even told her we hadn\u2019t yet had the shower so really didn\u2019t miss out on much but she left.\n\nOh, that is **NOT** the part she was upset about missing.", "NTA.  The important thing is that you had as safe and stress-free a pregnancy as possible, and that your baby is healthy and happy.\n\nMIL sounds like hard work, and also someone who needs very firm boundaries.", "INFO: where is your husband in all of this? It\u2019s his mother, why isn\u2019t he setting boundaries with her? She sounds like a nightmare so I don\u2019t totally blame you for what you did, at the same time, you can\u2019t expect her to be ok with it, particularly when she is not someone who would be ok with anything less than total control. Your husband needs to put his foot down with his mother, explain to her why you did what you did, and not let her dictate and push you both around. There\u2019s no reason why she should get to see the baby at all while she is making the demands she is now. I would say she sees the baby with you present, or not at all.", "NTA\n\n Being a grandparent is a privilege and not a right. You kept your rights as parents to enjoy your pregnancy, not be stressed and not have to deal with her brand of crazy. I say good for you.", "NTA. I mean, I\u2019m mostly thinking you\u2019ve been extremely patient allowing this person round you at all. Seems like someone you should cut out of your life or drastically limit meetings. Do you and your husband actually think she\u2019s a good person for your kid to have in their life?", "NTA\n\nI would talk to your husband about the fact that if she wants a relationship with her son and grandchild she should stop talking crap about you. = that's the solution i give for the case you don't want to go nuclear. \n\nMy nuclear aproach of this is going full NC, because:\n\n- she put conditions on coming over in your house when you aren't around \n\n- she won't stop talking crap about you even to your baby \n\n- she will never accept you \n\n- she will constantly cause trouble. \n\nBut that's what i would do.", "NTA \n\nAnd we\u2019ll done. Most couldn\u2019t pull that off with a controlling MIL. She is just annoyed that her dear little son didn\u2019t bother to tell her so obviously agreed to the plan. \n\nLet her stew and enjoy the silence", "NTA. Due to her reaction of saying you\u2019re brainwashing him, and to have him call her to come when you\u2019re not there..I wouldn\u2019t have her over at all and cut contact. You don\u2019t need that stress around your baby.", "NTA. After treating you that way and making those horrid comments, she didn\u2019t deserve to know.

Keep those boundaries up.", "NTA, Don't leave your child with this woman.  Your husband needs to firmly put his foot down that the 3 of you are a package deal, much like the two of your were a package deal when you were dating and got married.\n\nShe either gets her head out of her arse and accepts this or she is out of your lives.", "NTA. Congratulations on your beautiful baby.", "NTA! MIL is definitely the AH! Have firm boundaries with her. I would honestly only have her around supervised because she sounds like the type of MIL that would do what she wants over your desired parenting with your child. Her reaction shows it all THEN trying to have your husband a set her up to be around the baby without you\u2026nope she would have hard boundaries for me. It\u2019s your baby you did exactly what was right because it was your plan. Congrats on your new edition.", "NTA. You need to set boundaries right away. If she wants to see her grandchild, she will have to do it when you\u2019re around and on your schedule, not hers.

Strongly suggest joining the Facebook group monster in law support. Helped me tremendously", "NTA, you get to decide how to handle pregnancy it is your body! It is also your kid!

Sending hugs!!", "ESH\n\nSecret pregnancies NEVER work out. Ever. There was zero chance she wouldn't be hurt about this, or that it wouldn't do irrevocable harm to your relationship, and damage her relationship to the new baby from the start.\n\nIf you were no contact from the start, I could see this being ok, but yeah, she is going to hate you forever for this, and you will never hear the end of it. All the warmth you slowly earned is gone and dead and not coming back, and you're now the evil woman who has corrupted her son, which *will* color her opinion of your child.\n\nShe was ridiculous and impossible, yes, but this was handled in just about the worst way possible and I have no doubt you'll still be stuck listening to her resentment over this in fifty years.", "He does always shut it down!", "Well OP did say they decided together about this and if her husband was that kind to not shut down his mom's bs there wouldn't have been such a decision done together. (Not without a huge argument at least)", "He definitely won\u2019t, he showed me the text messages right away and no we didn\u2019t chose a name she picked out", "This is terrible advice. Leave her entire support network because MIL is overbearing? They have a newborn baby!", "Okay, settle down. There's no reason to think Grandma is going to hurt the baby.", "Stop.", "Good! Sorry you both are dealing with this. Sounds like a great story for r/justnomil", "MIL isn't support, she's stress", "You may be right if they actually have a support network. No one on the MIL side will be much help due to dealing with the MIL. But yeah, if there is a support network it would hopefully outweigh the impact of the MIL. Notice how there doesn't seem to be many other folks in their lives... but maybe OP left those details out.", "There\u2019s ample evidence that Grandma is going to emotionally and mentally damage the baby. Look at how her daughter is cowed and controlled. Want to repeat that into the next generation?", "There's quite a few stories here on Reddit when Grandma feeds solids long before the recommended age, has taken baby out for their first haircut, filled their bottle full of cows milk when baby is still on formula / breast milk, taken baby out in the car while baby is on her lap, all without parents consent", "Acting out isn\u2019t just physical. But maybe lashing would of been better? MIL not only doesn\u2019t like daughter in law but is also a control freak and moody. She could be watching the baby, the baby starts crying and it triggers her to yell at the baby or say harsh things or neglect the baby while it\u2019s in her care.", "No.", "Okay, how about OP's family? How about her friends? Her husband's friends? Their jobs? \n\nLet's dump all of that and flee the state with an infant because a redditor said to!\n\nIt must be teenagers coming up with this shit advice.", "Unless you know something OP hasn't shared with the rest of us, your imagination is running wild.", "And if OP said she has a history of doing this stuff with her SIL's kids, then we would have some reason to go there. Other grandmas on reddit are not a reason to pre-convict this lady.", "She could also be a super villain with an undersea hideout, plotting to steal the world's kiwis, but OP doesn't say any of that, either.", "NC is an extreme reaction, and you're talking about her husband's mother. They have decades ahead of them. It's surely preferable if they can improve their relationship. \n\nYour advice is like burning down a house because of a broken window.", "They aren't mentioned, we don't know how much support they have. But I agree, fleeing because of one overbearing parent is over the top.", "So the constant back handed comments, the miscarriage comment, everything that mil has done negatively to OP is NOT a good enough reason to go NC? That's weird.", "I mean what benefit does this woman bring into their life? Do you think it sounds like she would be a healthy influence on the kid?", "You don't seem to understand what NC with his mother would mean. Every family gathering, the relationship with his siblings, every holiday and birthday, is impacted. The NC condition will generate fresh pain and drama all the time. What is your perspective? Are you married? Kids? \n\nTake a second to think before dropping \"NC\" into a comment, it's a nuclear option.", "And you don't seem to understand what it's like dealing with a toxic ass person in your direct life. The miscarriage comment alone, do you have any clue how hard it is on someone who just lost their baby and hear hate spewing out of a relative? It's not a pleasant thing to hear. \n\nIt's pretty clear that from the time she started to show till 2 or 3 weeks after the baby was born the MIL didn't come around. And from OPs comments.. it sounds like the husband is thru of his mother's shit as well.\n\nETA: I cut my own father out of my life a year after my son was born for some dumb shit his wife said about me. It's been almost 5 years of absolute bliss", "You cut your own father out of your life a year after your son was born because of some mean shit his wife said about you.", "I cut my mother out of my life bc of how toxic she is. My family gatherings are actually enjoyable now. So please don't speak on something you really don't know anything personally about."]}
