{"id": 23682, "submission_id": "15fugio", "title": "AITA for telling my wife that I won\u2019t be opening the door for her creepy friend?", "selftext": "My (M41) wife, Becky (F39), is planning on traveling abroad to visit her sister and her family in the next few days. She'll be gone for the next 2 and a half weeks. Over the past year, my wife has become very good friends with our neighbour, Emily (F37), who lives a few houses down.\n\nLong story short, Emily makes me feel uncomfortable, and I think she's trying to make a move on me. At first, I thought she was joking, and I didn't think much of her behavior, but now it only makes me feel uncomfortable.\n\nEarlier today, Becky told me that she chatted with Emily and mentioned how she'd be going overseas for a few weeks. She said that Emily offered to come by and drop off some food for us (myself and our eleven-year-old daughter, Alice) from time to time.\n\nBecky was reluctant to agree, but after Emily insisted, she finally agreed. I was surprised that she'd agree to this without consulting me first, so I told her that it made me uncomfortable. Becky said that \"Emily means well\" and it would be rude if we were to refuse now. I said okay, but that she shouldn't be surprised if Alice and I \"forget\" to open the door every time Emily comes knocking.\n\nBecky said that I was being a jerk to someone offering us kindness.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE - Early this morning, I spoke to Becky about my concerns regarding Emily's behavior. She said that Emily doesn't have any ulterior motives and only means well. She also brought up how Emily has her own husband and always tells Becky how great he is. For some more context, Emily is married, but her husband isn't home too much as he works in the military.\n\nWhen I asked if she could tell Emily that we don't need food deliveries, she said it would be awkward to mention it right before her trip and how it would only be once or twice a week. Another thing Becky mentioned that has only increased my uneasiness is that Emily had given her a spare house key \"just in case of emergencies or anything like that.\"\n\nFor those wondering, my wife is leaving a few hours past midnight tonight.\n\nContext - For clarification regarding the key. Emily gave my wife her own house key, but doesn't have the key to our home.\n\nSome more context: For those wondering what Emily does, I can tell you that she does a lot of unnecessary physical contact, like hugging me whenever she sees me, which didn\u2019t bother me the first few times but increasingly makes me feel uneasy. Not only that, but she has made **very** suggestive comments in the past. I would also add that the way she dresses and her body language when she comes to our house seems to be a bit flirtatious.", "created_utc": 1690938117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fugio/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_i_wont_be_opening/", "score": 1876, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
