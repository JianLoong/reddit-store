I am simply referring to bikinis with a little less coverage. \n\nHe says he doesn't want to be the reason for a mother to be uncomfortable having to cover their children's eyes from seeing me (!!!!!) \n\nHe also says it's cool to wear it if we're alone, to which I responded, \"when the hell are we going to be alone at the beach? Oh, when we have our own private island of course!\" This is infuriating and honestly hilarious in a how ridiculous type of way. \n\nI told him quite frankly, I don't care who's around. I dress for myself. He thinks I should be more considerate of the children, and family. AITAH for that??!\n\nI will continue wearing what I want! I don't mean to make my husband uncomfortable but if it does, that's not my issue to handle. That's a personal problem.\n\nUpdate: :) actually he is adding to his reasons :) he says a thong bikini might not look the best on me at the moment and that maybe when I'm a little thicker, we can look into it :)))\nFor reference: I'm on the slimmer side.

I went to Spain with my friend years ago and it was so refreshing to see so many women completely comfortable in their skin. Topless ladies at every hotel pool, all shapes, sizes and ages. It was completely normal and they all clearly felt safe and confident enough to do so. I even went for it at our final stop which was a much larger resort (loved it!).

I used to think a woman should be able to wear whatever she wants and shame on anyone who thought less of her for it. I have worn string bikinis and been perfectly comfortable on public beaches where other people have worn them. Then last year I took my kids to a kid based hotel/water park. In the wave pool was a woman. At first, I thought she was totally naked, jumping up and down in a pool full of young kids. Then I saw that she did have a sort of suit on - probably one of those V suits you mentioned. It was the first time I've ever been uncomfortable about women's swim wear. Just something about this woman jumping around like that surrounded by 6 to 12 year old kids. I don't know what a cheeky swimsuit is. But I would now say whether it is appropriate really does depend on the situation. The way you have described it, I suspect it's perfectly fine. You shouldn't have to \"guess\" who is going to be present at the beach. But it really depends on the suit and the situation. It might be inappropriate to dress to a certain level of sexy in a place specifically designed for younger kids. Or maybe I'm just being prudish, idk. That wave pool woman gave me predator vibes.", "NTA. Husband telling you not to show off skin while at the same time having a cheeky look at females wearing less.", "*The children. The children!
