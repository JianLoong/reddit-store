In the wave pool was a woman. At first, I thought she was totally naked, jumping up and down in a pool full of young kids. Then I saw that she did have a sort of suit on - probably one of those V suits you mentioned. It was the first time I've ever been uncomfortable about women's swim wear. Just something about this woman jumping around like that surrounded by 6 to 12 year old kids. I don't know what a cheeky swimsuit is. But I would now say whether it is appropriate really does depend on the situation. The way you have described it, I suspect it's perfectly fine. You shouldn't have to \"guess\" who is going to be present at the beach. But it really depends on the suit and the situation. It might be inappropriate to dress to a certain level of sexy in a place specifically designed for younger kids. Or maybe I'm just being prudish, idk.
