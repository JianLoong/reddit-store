I met my husband 6 years ago; two years after me and my children's father split. We currently live in an apartment on the 4th floor. It's small and getting cramped as the kids get older so we have been in search of a bigger place for over a year at this point but haven't had any luck. \n\nMy husband got severely depressed last year after family stuff happened and during this time decided he needed an emotional support animal and opted for a dog. I begged him to wait it out until we got in to a house and he just.. wouldn't budge on the issue. Needed a dog right then and there and instead of getting an already trained dog (they have a facility in our area that trains both medical and emotional pets), he went out and got a puppy. A herding dog no less. I all but begged and pleaded that he return the dog for another breed because I know how high maintenance herding dogs are but he refused because he \"fell in love with her\". The dog did help him out in a sense but her behaviors are all over the place and every time we train her out of one thing, she regresses in another area. It's been harder for me to accept because I never wanted this. My husband just went back to work 7 months ago and now all of the responsibilities have fallen off on me because I'm the one working from home. \n\nJust to outline a few things here.. I have been written up twice now for having to jump off of my work computer to go tend to the dog, who gets on the table, gets in the garbage, takes off down the street on potty breaks after wiggling out of her harness and/or breaking them- just to come back upstairs and take a shit on my floor, etc. The other day she latched on to my leg while I was vaccuming because of the noise, I'm assuming. She constantly goes after the cat. I'm just fed up, completely. Because, again, this is not what I wanted and now I'm struggling to maintain work and an animal with behavioral issues. So my husband texts me everyday while he is working and we hardly have good days in this house. So when he asks how I am or how the dog is being, I straight up tell him exactly what's going on here. Well yesterday he texted and I said I couldn't do this anymore. He needed to find someone to take the dog during the day because I'm done. Well beyond my limit here. He immediately starts berating me for \"constantly fucking complaining about the dog versus try to bond with her because she is probably acting out due to your bullshit.\" Keep in mind she does these behaviors even with him home so it's definitely not me.

But your husband is. **He is relying on the dog for emotional support, but he's not even providing for her basic needs.** She's acting out because she hasn't been trained and she's no getting enough activity. \n\nHe had the option of getting a trained emotional support animal, but he didn't get one, and while an animal doesn't need ESA training, pets do need basic training. Work dogs need to be active, you need peace to work. You might loose your job.It sounds like your husband doesn't care about your needs or the dog's needs.", "NTA. As someone with severe mental issues, including depression, who got a dog to help my mental health, your husband is a selfish AH.\nI would have never gotten my girl against my partner's wishes and then force my partner to do the bulk of the training and caring while he was trying to work. No. Nope. I trained her, I care for her, I take responsibility for her needs. Your husband clearly couldn't do the same and seems to have chosen getting a support animal over you.\n\nI'd be completely on his side if you had agreed to take this on and then just couldn't be bothered anymore, but that doesn't seem to be the case.", "NTA\n\nBut this is not a good environment for this dog, and she's acting out because she needs space to run. Herding dogs are working dogs, and without a way to work off that energy she's only going to get more destructive. Plus, having a dog really does limit your options for housing.\n\nY W B T A if you don't have a frank discussion with your husband about rehoming the dog. She needs to be with a family who can meet her needs, and you aren't able to do that. And honestly, it's cruel of your husband and incredibly selfish for him to make such a unilateral decision that is only good for him and no one else.", "NTA. He never should've brought an animal into your home without you being okay with it. Keep reminding him of his mistake till he takes you seriously and finds a way to fix the problem he made.", "NTA. I adore dogs. And I will be the first to advocate against having a dog if not all the adults in the household are willing to be involved. People live in some kind of bubble thinking dogs naturally learn how to behave. But the hard reality is (especially for dogs with high energy levels and hyperactivity) - they need consistency, boundaries and exercise. And if all the adults present in the household cannot provide that, it will fail. For me it sounds like your dog lacks boundaries and exercise. And your husband is unable to see it because well, he is not there. I suggest you to either re-home the dog or take a different approach when it comes to its education. The dog is not acting out because of you, it's acting out because it's missing something. For your own sanity start with consistent physical activities - hubs waking up an 1.5h earlier to exercise the dog, you might want to introduce crate training, so the dog learns an off switch, sniff mats for mental exercise while at home. If rehoming is not an option, you will need to invest in decent behavioural trainings. I am saying this as a person who owned a very high energy, high drive dog. That dog tested every singl boundary known to man and I learned a lot about animal behaviour and needs.", "NTA for complaining. Anyone would complain.  \nYour husband is not nice. Dogs are a \"two yes one no\" thing and he did it anyway.  \nI think, now, you need to make a decision about the dog. Are you willing to put your foot down about the dog even if that means the end of your marriage? Couples therapy might help deal with these issues but you might end up living separately (or separating). I would strongly encourage you not to move until you've decided if you have to get rid of the dog.  \n(I think you should get rid of the dog and possibly the husband as well but you know all the details of your life and are best placed to know what the right thing to do is.)", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re NTA because he should have gotten a well trained dog but got a high maintenance one which now falls on you. Now he has to pick a struggle. Depression or family financial burdens. Those are 2 sucky struggles to have to pick. He put himself in this situation by not going with one trained that you could\u2019ve handled.", "NTA\n\nDogs are ALOT to handle. I don\u2019t know why people assume a dog is a great pet and never get it trained or realize how much time goes into them DAILY even if they are trained. \n\nYou told your husband your stance and how it is affecting you negatively. He doesn\u2019t seem to care and is just saying it\u2019s your fault. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to deal with the extra stress from the dog, and the dog obviously needs an environment where it can get it\u2019s needs met. (Exercise etc) \n\nHe definitely picked the wrong dog for an apartment and for you having other responsibilities. There are plenty of animals out there that don\u2019t need as much or cause as much stress. Even other dog breeds that don\u2019t need much exercise and etc. \n\nYour husband needs to actually look at this logically and not emotionally.", "NTA\n\nTell him he either does something with the dog while you are working or you will have to rethink the marriage. Or rehome the dog on your own. A working dog is not appropriate for an apartment. He's the asshole just for that.", "NTA - He got a dog that you didn't want, so it's technically his responsibility. Seeing as the dog is affecting your ability to work and has even gotten you written up twice, you really do have ground to demand that he finds somewhere for the dog to be during the day (alternatively, he should be home with the dog - if he can't, he should have thought about that before getting a dog).\n\nBeing depressed is awful and I really feel for him, but there are a lot of other options to try before getting an emotional support animal. I understand that he needed something to help, but unlike medicine or therapy, you can't just stop being a dog-owner when you feel better. It's a lot of responsibility that everyone in the household (at least the adults) should be ok with. You clearly weren't ok with that, but he got a dog anyway.\n\nHe wanted the dog and it's obviously not working that it's at home with you, so he has to find another solution. You don't have to feel guilty over this.", "You have a husband problem not a dog problem.\n\nTell him he either rehome the dog or moves out.\n\nNTA", "Husband and dog both need rehoming \nNta", "NTA. I\u2019ve raised two herding dogs while working from home full time. I do have a partner who also WFH full time, but my office is on the same floor as the dog kennels and I joke that I\u2019m the first line of defense.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot better now, but when they\u2019re younger and needier, it\u2019s HARD. I have good flexibility, so when I do need to attend to a dog, it\u2019s usually okay. I also have my partner WFH so I have backup. You don\u2019t seem to have either of those things, OP, and that would make things very difficult. I know firsthand some of what you deal with, and you have my sympathy here.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019d be out of line to suggest trying doggy daycare (although this gets expensive quickly and not all herding dogs do well in that environment) or a dog walker. Or a \u201cday camp\u201d style daycare with training (this exists in some places, might be worth finding out if you can get her into one). But this isn\u2019t sustainable and I fail to see why your career should be the one taking a hit for his unilateral choice. If he can\u2019t accept that his dog needs more and so do you, and he won\u2019t take steps to actively help you manage this, then the dog should go to someone who can care for her properly.\n\nAlso, your husband is a giant asshole.", "NTA. Let me say that again and again N T A! N T A! N T A! Your husband is and in all honesty I would have taken the puppy back myself and explained that I didn\u2019t agree to the dog and it\u2019s not staying in my house. Your husband is a total ass hole and is lazy to boot. He wasn\u2019t willing to make a compromise and got a pet against your wishes when a pet is an all or nothing situation. He\u2019s also an ass hole bc he got a pet and put it in a situation where the dog will fail bc it\u2019s not a breed for small places. It needs a crap ton of room to run and run and did I say run?!?! He also didn\u2019t properly take care of it or train it. Now he\u2019s throwing it off on you bc he\u2019s lazy!!! He is neglecting that dog so much that it needs to go away. It needs to be given to a nice family that has land for that dog to run and play. It needs a family who will properly train it. It deserves a family that has the means to provide what it needs. Your family doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s not your fault. That is your husbands fault.", "NTA doggie daycare is available but might be costly. Find a place, calculate the cost and tell hubby he needs to take the dog there or find a another solution", "NTA. He wanted a pet and found a way to make you feel guilty for not wanting to take care of it. Then he dumped it on you.", "NTA He would either take the dog to a doggie day care, hire a dog sitter or rehome it.", "NTA\n\nbut your husband is. \n\nI get it, people cope differently, but animals are a huge commitment and the fact that he ignored your wishes shows how much he disrespects you. Having depression is no excuse either, you were willing to compromise but he wasn't.", "Husband gets a choice. Doggy daycare or doggy new home. He can pick. But he\u2019s paying for the daycare.", "NTA, your husband is selfish and foolish.", "NTA. His dog, his problem.", "NTA. Maybe show this sub to your husband. There are a lot of good points made about the behavior of the dog being linked to its breed, and that if he doesn't want the dog rehomed, he needs to invest in third party training and care.", "NTA. What is it with immature adults and their dogs?", "NTA. Having the dog is affecting your work. I doubt he\u2019d be so defensive if he had to take the dog to his work and care for her. She needs a new home where she can get that energy out and if your husband does not allow this, call Victoria from Me Or The Dog so she can talk sense into him.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think you necessarily need to rehome. If you could afford a dog already trained to be a service animal (I just researched this for my son, they\u2019re upwards of $10K), then you could afford quality training. They have places that take the dogs for a week for intense training. They have places that take the dog all day. Try one of these options before rehoming, if you can. \n\nEdited to add: having a working dog in an apartment is going to continue to require a lot of work. That dog needs to be ran hard every day. Long walks, trips to the dog park, lots of play. Also it will need strong training, as a heeler can become aggressive if left unchecked. If y\u2019all can\u2019t get that kind of training, which also requires lots of work in the home, I do think rehoming will be necessary.", "NTA, you're justified in feeling frustrated. This is an additional workload that you explicitly didn't sign up for. Your request for your husband to arrange doggy daycare is a reasonable one, since the dog's needs are clearly negatively impacting your ability to do your job. And your dog also sounds like she/he could benefit from an environment with more stimulation, exercise, and doggy company.\n\nBut, and I know this sub doesn't like nuanced advice, your husband is definitely benefiting from having the dog and loves him/her, and probably interpreted your request as an attack \"you don't love me or my dog\". Also, it sounds like your dog is being a typical high needs teenager. Most dogs are w@nkers between the ages of one and two.\n\n If you explain to your husband that your pup deserves more attention that you can give it while working from home, he might be more receptive to the idea. And don't lose sight of the fact that by the time the dog is three or four they will have become a much much nicer member of the family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I clean up the mess and stick her in her crate, where she proceeds to whine to an point where I can't hear my work phone (headset). So I let her out of the kennel.

I know that makes me sound incredibly stupid or just plain resentful but that's really how she acts every day.
