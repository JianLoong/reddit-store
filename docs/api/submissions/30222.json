She may have experience since she raised you, yeah, BUT you are the mom and your word is final in the raising your child. She 100% should have asked, and if there was a problem with formula, she should have called you and asked about the way of action you would prefer.

NTA and you have a whole damn right to tell your mom, that you don't trust her with your child anymore. She meant no harm, but she doesn't respect you and your decisions.  \nAnd if left like this, this matter can become worse in the future. Like, she can be feeding your kid whatever she wants (sincerely, with good intentions, but possibly dangerous anyway), and never tell you, and you can never know! \nBut I think because there was no malicious intent, perhaps you can talk to her and set some boundaries?

You put your mother in an impossible situation by not pumping enough milk. \n\nThis is on you.", "ESH but it's mostly your mom. \n\nI don't know your supply, but I do know that it's your responsibility to know if your child has special dietary requirements and to provide those things if they have them. \n\nYou exclusively breastfed, the first time your child receives a bottle of formula should not be with another person. Formula often causes constipation, while breastmilk is a natural laxative. I couldn't produce enough with my oldest and so she was 99% formula fed and received a frozen/thawed breastmilk feeding when she was constipated or sick. I just pumped and froze what little I made for the occasion. Everyone who watched her was aware of the procedure for constipation, breastmilk until I completely dried up, juice after, and she'd receive a neonatal glycerin suppository on the 4th day since her last bowel movement (her specialists were concerned about becoming suppository dependant and wanted to give her every opportunity to pass stool independently). \n\nShe also had formula issues (like constipation and reflux) and I knew exactly which types of formula worked best for her and made sure she always had an extra can in her diaper bag just in case. \n\nMy oldest son caused an over supply and the one night I was away from him, I had 56 oz in the freezer specifically for my mom to give him. I made sure there was double of what was reasonable for a one month old. \n\nFor my youngest, I had supply issues at first, and used formula again, again I knew which formula worked for him. He had no issues from any formulas, probably because he was 50/50 with breastmilk so constipation wasn't an issue. \n\nThis is YOUR JOB to know. You do not have the luxury of winging it while also being angry that the people you left your child in the care of also winged it. This would not have happened if you had properly provided for your child and been informed about his dietary needs. \n\nBut, you get a lot of grace because you've been a mom for 3 months and you're still learning the basics. It's okay, you'll get there, but this is a lesson you should remember and you should try various formulas if this situation (leaving your child for long enough to run out of breastmilk) is possibly going to happen again. \n\nYour mother doesn't get that grace, she's been a mom for over 2 decades and should know better than to accept half a century old advice from her own mother, and should be well aware of the violently paranoid and protective mom hormones going on within the body of a newly postpartum woman separated from her baby. She, as a veteran mom, knows darn well that baby raising advice changes rapidly and even a decade between babies can lead to vastly different advice from medical professionals. She should have known to call you with any issues concerning your baby.\n\nThen she doubled down instead of acknowledging her mess up and apologizing. What kind of role model is that for her new mom daughter? Teaching that being a mom means never admitting mistakes even if that isn't in the best interest of the child? Absolutely inappropriate and she doesn't have the excuse of age or inexperience.", "INFO\n\nWhy did you not supply her with enough milk?

You should apologise to her and either don\u2019t let her watch your son in future or have a discussion about what to do next time and your expectations. A little gratitude wouldn\u2019t go amiss. Another planning issue on your part- did you have a conversation before hand about what you expected to be contacted about? Like on a night out if baby is crying my mother didn\u2019t contact me as there was nothing I could do hours away and it would only serve to stress me out and I trust her fully to handle it.

It shouldn't have mattered if she ran out of breastmilk. The issue is that she chose to put an additive (corn syrup) into it, and a dangerous one at that. OP is upset about the corn syrup. Also, even without the botulism risk, it's not safe for infants under 6 months to have anything BUT formula or breastmilk. It is not safe. Dangers range from electrolyte imbalance to intestinal damage from it being too complex for LO to process on his own. Botulism also sets in quickly, and if LO did contract it grandma may not catch it in time for treatment. Not to be a fear monger, as it's still uncommon, but it is unfortunately a fact of life and a risk of corn syrup. Enough so that it says on the bottle \"not for under age one\". \n\nI'd also bet that the reason LO was so colicky is because grandma overfed him formula. Small babies (especially ones that are usually ebf) will drink and drink and drink with bottles without realizing they're full right away, and it gives them massive stomach issues. It appears like they're starving bc they will just keep going. That's why paced feeding is recommended with bottles now because it helps cut down on the colic and lets their stomachs have time to tell their brain \"oop! I'm done!\". The bottle flow is usually faster than breast. I'm also wondering if the reason she ran out of breastmilk was the same.

It's not uncommon for like 80% of new mams to dry up within the first couple of months just because, and having support of a lactation consultant through that is better than a guessing game with an OB or physician.\n\nEdit: mam wants to throw it in OP's face that she and GMA have been mothers longer and shit, but failed to mentioned that it's *always* been common, **and normal** for babies that go from breast to formula to have upset tummies and **it's usually just gas** unless they're allergic, but since there's no mention of excessive vomiting on babies part, I assume that isnt the case. \n\nAlso, mam admits fully she is not above lying.

You\u2019ve been doing it for three months, you\u2019re obviously the expert, and your mom clearly can\u2019t raise a child to adulthood.", "YTA\n\nIn asking your mother and grandmother to watch your child, you're asking two experienced mothers, whom presumably you trust; to provide care. Unless you expect them to ignore their collective experience being mothers, you can't rationally expect them to call you for every little thing.\n\nUnderstand, the issues you're raising regarding how your child was cared are **not little**, but that's from your perspective. From theirs, their going to apply what they know, and not reach out regarding things that their experience tells them is minimal. \n\nThere were a few issues you cited here, you mentioned they ran out of pumped milk; and so gave the kiddo formula. I don't see an issue with that personally, barring pre-provided instructions from you; because the alternative is just letting the kid starve. You didn't raise an issue with this in particular either, and in my mind them calling you to ask if they should give the kid formula would have resulted in a \"duh, feed the kid\" conversation.\n\nNow the reason I highlight that formula issue is that it's similar to the syrup issue. It's a relatively benign choice about the child's care that doesn't require confirmation from you that its necessary or appropriate. With respect to the use of syrup, from their perspective that is similarly benign. New information may invalidate that idea, as research and the availability of research has likely expanded between the time your grandmother raised your mother, and your mother raised you; but they don't know that. They know what works based upon their experience and they're applying it. \n\nIf something is now considered dangerous that wasn't in the past, and you know about it; its on you to inform them about those risks as much as possible. The alternative is the expectation that they re-research things that are obviously safe, which isn't reasonable. As an example, imagine new research indicated eating broccoli causes cancer. If you weren't informed of that, would you ever have a reason to randomly google \"does broccoli cause cancer?\" Of course not. \n\nHowever, similarly, that's not to say that this situation is \"your fault\" because you didn't inform them. You don't know what they don't know either. The reality is that sometimes, there experience in knowledge is going to conflict with yours, and that's only going to be apparent after the fact. What you can do is do your best to inform them about the things that concern you; and endeavor to educate when things you didn't anticipate arise that cause you concern; but to cast them broadly as \"unsafe\" seems over the top.\n\nThe exception here, is that when a syrup situation comes up and you educate them on why that's a problem and ask them not to do it again; if they refuse to acknowledge your own concerns as a parent or new information generally, then they would absolutely be T A, that just doesn't seem to be the case here. \n\nThey are correct that you've only been a mother for three months, but highlighting your inexperience is irrelevant, unnecessarily derogatory, and completely beside the point. They can hold up the fact that they are indeed experienced mothers without minimizing your own role as a mother. They are right to point out that they've done this before, but the way they went about expressing that, in comparing how they're \"better\" equipped to be a mother at all, was inappropriate.\n\nIn the end, the reason I'm giving he verdict I am is based on your decision to exclude them from being caregivers entirely. That seems to be an over-correction on the issue; and I can't look at two experienced mothers and call them A H-es for applying what they \"know\" to be simple remedies to non-threatening/common situations that crop up during child care; in the same way that I wouldn't cast you as a generally unsafe or unfit parent because of the constellation of things you too probably don't know this early into motherhood. This would be different if they were more aware of those risks in advance and then ignored them.\n\nTwo more things, First:\n\n>I told her that I can\u2019t trust her to watch my son anymore because she is too comfortable exposing him to new things without my consent \\[...\\]\n\nIt's a months old baby.
