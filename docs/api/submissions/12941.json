You had one.\n\nHeath picked up Christopher with no complaints, and refused to take back his money.\n\nWhy your sister thought you should have called *her* (not the stepmother, still just dating) instead of the father is beyond me, but *Heath* could always have called her if there was a problem, so it doesn't signify.", "NTA. You did the right thing and sometimes parents have to miss important meetings because their children need their care.", "NTA. They're his kids and it made more sense for him to pick them up.

But it's just not on for family to dump kids with profound needs on those who are child free just because it's convenient. Either they need professional carers or there's not really a learning/mental health difficulty it's just shitty behaviour being tolerated by shitty parents.\n\nBut that's not your job to deal with. It's the parents. Your sister is being unreasonable by chewing you out for this. Again it's not yours to deal with.

If she thought Heath's training and client meeting were so important, she should've taken the day off to watch his kids.\n\nConsider it a blessing that she's not going to ask you for any more favors.", "NTA. Sounds like some (semi-)professional facilities need to be on hand for this kid, and you, understandably, don't have such facilities. \n\nBut also, sister and boyfriend could have prepared better and communicated which one was on call for emergencies at what time.

I mean did he think that any daycare wouldn't have told him to pick his son up asap if he were destroying the classroom? \n\n*Sometimes* being the parent of a special needs child feels like treading radioactive water and you can't swim.

(You didn't want to get up early and go over to theirs?)\n\n(3) They asked you to baby-sit b/c you gave off the impression you know about and could handle THIS (again, part of the reason he gave you $250) -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Christopher has severe behavioral issues. ODD, ADHD, and is currently being tested for ASD.

I babysit my niece for free b/c I love her.  It was your problem, at least during that agreed upon timeframe.", "I'll go against the grain and offer a YTA. First, you being \"childfree\" is irrelevant to the story. If you didn't want to be around these kids, you could have just not taken the job. Then you say this:\n\n> No child should be around an adult who was that angry and I recognized that and needed him to leave.\n\nSorry, but if you have such anger issues that a literal child throwing a temper tantrum can make you upset enough you're worried you're going to do something bad to the kid, you need serious help. \n\nNext- he's a literal child and you're 28. You can prevent him from destroying your house. The strength difference is large enough, you can, without causing any injury, restrain him from doing anything until he's calmed down. \n\nOnce you agreed to care for the child, you needed to care for the child til the end of the agreed upon time unless there was an actual emergency. Nothing this child did seemed to be out of the ordinary for the behavior you knew was possible. The child was not injured. You had options remaining. You offering the  money back doesn't absolve you of your agreed upon responsibilities. \n\nIt would have been fine to never offer to do it again. If the kid was hurt, of course you call the parents. But you're an adult who agreed to do a job you knew could be hard. Once it got hard, you don't just get to say \"welp, don't want to do it anymore.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(The dad is presumably not a specialist.)\n\nI would argue that parents of kids with these issues *are* specialists. Unless these issues are very new, the parents have tons of experience in dealing with the issue and likely have learned lots of methods to use to mitigate the behaviors.  Even if a child is in the care of people trained to work with behavioral issues, the child being sent home is always a possibility if their behaviors are endangering themselves or others (and if a child is destroying a house, there is definitely danger there).    \n\nPlus, why would you call an ambulance for a behavior issue?

NTA\n\nI brought my 11 year old niece home with me after visiting my sister, and she turned out to be a holy terror.  We put her on a plane and sent her home. My sister calls Mom and says she can't believe \"Anna\" acted like that and she won't be allowed to visit again. Mom deadpanned back, \"What makes you think there was going to be another invitation?\"", "Heath has to be desperate for a mom to take these kids over.", "Nta but stupid to even agree to do it", "NTA\n\nSister is though for blowing up at you for choosing the only solution that was viable for you.", "TF is this BS? CPS is not needed for anything here.", "LMAO TF it isn't.", "Let's put the most important part of the response up front:\n\nThe kid didn't behave in a way that OP considered that shocking. She knew it was possible the kid would throw a tantrum when she agreed to watch her. If her only plan was \"hope it doesn't happen\" she should have simply said, \"sorry, I'm not qualified to do this.\" Because she didn't help, the only thing she did was make the parents' life way harder. \n\nIf someone says \"can I hire you to do this thing, by the way these things might happen\" and you say \"yes\" and then as soon as the things happen which you were previously warned about, well then you can't be surprised when they happen. Like when I hired someone to dog sit my dog and said \"look, my dog is not cat friendly, you can't let a cat into the house with my dog here\" and then they let a cat in a couple days into house sitting, and then got pissed at me that my dog chased their cat, they were in the wrong. \n\nNow, on to other things. Yes, kids can piss off adults and you need to find a way to calm yourself down.  But they can do that to parents just as much as baby sitters. Yes, adults, who agreed to care for children, have to have a way to calm down, other than just handing the child over. \n\nAnd bullshit on someone getting hurt if you have to restrain a six year old. Six year olds have almost zero strength compared to an adult. You can easily restrain one, with neither person getting hurt. \n\nAnd linking back to the beginning: no, an emergency would be the child doing something outside of what OP knew was very much in the realm of possibility, or the child getting hurt.  OP knowing the child can throw a tantrum, in fact knowing it's likely, then the child doing that does not constitute an emergency."]}
