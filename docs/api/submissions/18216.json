Together we have a 14 years old daughter Amy and she has a 17 years old daughter Lisa.\n\nLisa is very girly just like my wife she also looks like my wife a lot and they are both very beautiful.\n\nMy wife believes that girls must wear girly clothes. Dresses, skirts and other things like this however the problem is that Amy doesn't have much of a \"girly\" face and doesn't look good in girly clothes.\n\nA few weeks ago we took some pictures of both girls and my wife put Lisa's pictures in the livingroom however she insisted that we should put Amy's pictures in her bedroom because \"there is no more space in the living room\". She didn't exactly say she thinks Amy is ugly but both Amy and I knew that this was basically what she meant and Amy had tears in her eyes\n\nI was so mad so I decided to do something. I got a hairdreeser appointment for Amy and told her she can do whatever she wants. She cut her hair short and colored them. Then we got 2 more piercings on her ears and then we went shopping and bought many clothes for her. This time instead of choosing dresses she decided to buy boy clothes. She looked amazing in them and was very happy.\n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. We can't exactly afford to buy that many clothes when she doesn't even need them. I am the breadwinner and my wife is the SAHM. She has been saving money for a vacation and she has been looking forward to it because she doesn't get to go to vacations much\n\nI have access to my wife's account and I used her vacation money to pay for everything. When we returned home my wife was horrified because I didn't let her know about changing my daughter's appearance. She asked me where I got the money to buy those and I told her the truth. She just bursted out crying calling me an asshole because she didn't get to have fun for years and I stopped her from going to a vacation that she was looking forward to\n\nShe thinks I'm the ah and is giving me the silent treatment\n\nEdit: it seems like everyone agrees that I was an asshole and I accept that\n\nHowever it made my daughter very happy so I guess I like being an asshole and I will continue to be one. My wife can get her \"vacation\" whenever she apologizes from my daughter and puts her pictures in the living room and stops forcing my daughter to wear what she doesn't like otherwise I'm not paying for a vacation for her. She is free to get a job and earn the money herself though since the kids are old enough and don't need her much", "created_utc": 1685104804, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sc4uu/aita_for_using_my_wifes_vacation_money_without/", "score": 4255, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's be honest, you might have been cheering your daughter up, but you were doing it out of complete spite to your wife.\n\nInstead of talking it out like mature adults you chose to go nuclear. Instead of removing half the photos of Lisa and swapping them with Amy's photos so they'd equally be in the main room, you decided to take away something from your wife.

I say if she wants to treat your daughter that way she can get a job if she wants fun money. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be giving money to anyone treating my kid that way.

Your wife was so far out of line trying to hide away her daughter because she isn't pretty enough to have her picture in the living room, because she's forcing her to dress in a way that isn't flattering for her. She failed as a stay at home mother by denying her child exactly what you did for your daughter. You were an asshole to your wife, but a hero for your daughter.

Obviously, your wife is doing damage to your daughter, but you also let this go on until it got to this point. This didn't come out of nowhere, as an fyi. You had perfect agency as a parent to make sure your younger daughter was being respected. This tells me you left the majority of parenting responsibilities to your wife without much involvement or were involved and ignored the warning signs.\n\nYou also just sent everyone in the family a terrible message in that you and your wife are not equals. You used control of money to make a point. That's the easy way out, but is designed to create as much conflict as possible in the house. Your wife's vacation money was unrelated to how she treated the kids. You used money to control and punish. It does not fix the root issue. In fact, it can make your wife and older daughter resent your younger daughter, and tells your younger daughter your wife has no authority in the house, which has the chance to backfire horribly as she goes into the teenage years. What if you wife has to legitimately parent on a tough issue unrelated to her image hang ups? Your daughter isn't  going to take her seriously. And you let this go on for so many years, I don't think you are going to, either, because you seem to take the hands off until it reaches a boiling point approach. This is how you get spoiled, entitled adults. You can't undermine the parent taking the majority of parenting duties. If there's a problem with the parenting, it needs to be discussed between the parents like mature adults \n\nYou needed to be talking to your wife about her treatment of the girls and getting to the root issue of why she was so caught up in gender norms.

My 14-year-old has a chronic illness that means they miss a lot of school, has bipolar depression and a history of suicidal ideation; I'm not leaving them home alone and not even family is willing to \"babysit\" a teen with that history.\nI worked full time until I ran out of FMLA, then on a very flexible schedule until I was injuried in such a way that I'll have to find a new line of work (hard to find flexibility in an entry-level job). So I'm a SAHM now whether I want to be or not. Sure I have time alone when both kids make it to school, but it's more a source of depression for me than any big benefit.\n\nTo the matter at hand: I think OP's a justified AH and the whole family needs to get into therapy.", "Have you ever seen the pile of laundry that teenagers produce? Or considered that they might have extracurricular activities? A social life?  Also, a house still doesn't clean itself and food in the fridge won't turn itself into a cooked meal. Heck, that's ignoring how it gets in the fridge in the first place. \n\nI'm not saying she can't do a job, part-time or otherwise. But I don't think she's necessarily lazy.", "Didn\u2019t see that comment. In the original post he states \u201cI have access to my wife\u2019s account\u201d so that money is obviously delegated only to her. It\u2019s possible to have multiple accounts as well", "There is if all he has to do when he comes home is relax. If she\u2019s doing all house and life Maintanence and all he has to do is work and come home and enjoy, then she\u2019s still doing a lot.", "That's not how partnership works. It's *their* money, not his. *They* decided she would be the stay at home parent. He didn't give the money to her, they're partners. It was always her money, too, she's not his child she's his partner. The fact that she had to scrimp and save the allowances he gave her like a child, shows that this is not an equal or financially respectful partnership.", "I don't think so she could have saved from grocery budget or sacrificing something else she would have liked. Also Sahm means it their money and she did earn it by taking care of the house and childcare even if far from perfect.", "What on EARTH does this have to do with anything anyone is talking  about", "Not everyone can walk to school. We live 7 miles away on a state highway with a 55 mph speed limit and no sidewalks.", "Want to know something weird... (1) you can still be a stay at home mom to teenaged kids, as, oddly enough, kids do still require care as they age and still often require rides to appointments, afterschool activities, food for lunch, dinner, et cetera... and (2) being out of the workforce for the duration it takes to raise kids significantly hampers an individual's ability to return to the workforce and certainly impedes their ability to get a high-earning job. \n\nI say this as someone who has no kids and has had a full-time job for more than 20 years... But I absolutely know this to be fact because this is very much a reason why we haven't hired certain people at places I have worked...", "The majority of them, in the US at least. We don't know that she's lazy, she might be taking the children to extra curriculars, doing all the chores, making healthy food for the family, she might be doing gig work. There was a post not long ago where a man said his wife was a STaHM, except she was doing all the finances for his business.", "Childcare when they are 14 and 17?", "Here's another take:\n\nOP isn't going to reward his wife with a vacation in one hand while he allows her to tear down his daughter with the other.\n\nFocus less on the financials, I promise you its a red hearing. It's their money, in their account. OP had access to the account, so its \"their money\" regardless of it being \"her account\".\n\nOP's wife is trying to project an image on a daughter that doesn't fit that person, and trying to hide favoritism behind the thinnest excuse. The cost of starting to rebuild OP's daughters mental health was subtracted from their vacation funds.", "And he used their money to prioritize their daughters happiness over HER vacation. So what did he do wrong?", "He said that she\u2019s free to work if she wants. Sound like she just don\u2019t want to. Kids are 14 and 17, they aren\u2019t even at home during school time so what is she even doing ? If she don\u2019t want an allowance she can work. \nAnd it\u2019s just vacations, not a vital thing or a given.", "Yes? It's not the same as childcare when they are younger, but they do still need a lot of care.\n\nNot saying Mom shouldn't get a job, but she presumably isn't twiddling her thumbs either."]}
