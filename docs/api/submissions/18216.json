Together we have a 14 years old daughter Amy and she has a 17 years old daughter Lisa.\n\nLisa is very girly just like my wife she also looks like my wife a lot and they are both very beautiful.\n\nMy wife believes that girls must wear girly clothes. Dresses, skirts and other things like this however the problem is that Amy doesn't have much of a \"girly\" face and doesn't look good in girly clothes.\n\nA few weeks ago we took some pictures of both girls and my wife put Lisa's pictures in the livingroom however she insisted that we should put Amy's pictures in her bedroom because \"there is no more space in the living room\". She didn't exactly say she thinks Amy is ugly but both Amy and I knew that this was basically what she meant and Amy had tears in her eyes\n\nI was so mad so I decided to do something. I got a hairdreeser appointment for Amy and told her she can do whatever she wants. She cut her hair short and colored them. Then we got 2 more piercings on her ears and then we went shopping and bought many clothes for her. This time instead of choosing dresses she decided to buy boy clothes. She looked amazing in them and was very happy.\n\nThis is where I might be the asshole. We can't exactly afford to buy that many clothes when she doesn't even need them. I am the breadwinner and my wife is the SAHM. She has been saving money for a vacation and she has been looking forward to it because she doesn't get to go to vacations much\n\nI have access to my wife's account and I used her vacation money to pay for everything. When we returned home my wife was horrified because I didn't let her know about changing my daughter's appearance. She asked me where I got the money to buy those and I told her the truth. She just bursted out crying calling me an asshole because she didn't get to have fun for years and I stopped her from going to a vacation that she was looking forward to\n\nShe thinks I'm the ah and is giving me the silent treatment\n\nEdit: it seems like everyone agrees that I was an asshole and I accept that\n\nHowever it made my daughter very happy so I guess I like being an asshole and I will continue to be one. My wife can get her \"vacation\" whenever she apologizes from my daughter and puts her pictures in the living room and stops forcing my daughter to wear what she doesn't like otherwise I'm not paying for a vacation for her. She is free to get a job and earn the money herself though since the kids are old enough and don't need her much", "created_utc": 1685104804, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sc4uu/aita_for_using_my_wifes_vacation_money_without/", "score": 323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's be honest, you might have been cheering your daughter up, but you were doing it out of complete spite to your wife.\n\nInstead of talking it out like mature adults you chose to go nuclear. Instead of removing half the photos of Lisa and swapping them with Amy's photos so they'd equally be in the main room, you decided to take away something from your wife.

I say if she wants to treat your daughter that way she can get a job if she wants fun money. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be giving money to anyone treating my kid that way.

Your wife was so far out of line trying to hide away her daughter because she isn't pretty enough to have her picture in the living room, because she's forcing her to dress in a way that isn't flattering for her. She failed as a stay at home mother by denying her child exactly what you did for your daughter. You were an asshole to your wife, but a hero for your daughter.

Obviously, your wife is doing damage to your daughter, but you also let this go on until it got to this point. This didn't come out of nowhere, as an fyi. You had perfect agency as a parent to make sure your younger daughter was being respected. This tells me you left the majority of parenting responsibilities to your wife without much involvement or were involved and ignored the warning signs.\n\nYou also just sent everyone in the family a terrible message in that you and your wife are not equals. You used control of money to make a point. That's the easy way out, but is designed to create as much conflict as possible in the house. Your wife's vacation money was unrelated to how she treated the kids. You used money to control and punish. It does not fix the root issue. In fact, it can make your wife and older daughter resent your younger daughter, and tells your younger daughter your wife has no authority in the house, which has the chance to backfire horribly as she goes into the teenage years. What if you wife has to legitimately parent on a tough issue unrelated to her image hang ups? Your daughter isn't  going to take her seriously. And you let this go on for so many years, I don't think you are going to, either, because you seem to take the hands off until it reaches a boiling point approach. This is how you get spoiled, entitled adults. You can't undermine the parent taking the majority of parenting duties. If there's a problem with the parenting, it needs to be discussed between the parents like mature adults \n\nYou needed to be talking to your wife about her treatment of the girls and getting to the root issue of why she was so caught up in gender norms. This honestly is probably a deeper issue that needs a family therapist. The only way to make it better long term is to either get to the root cause or straight separate and remove the issue by separating.
