{"id": 1554, "submission_id": "yn1amo", "title": "AITA for banning my deceased wife's parents from her funeral?", "selftext": "My (32F) wife (30F) passed away in childbirth about three months ago. Obviously, a sperm donor was involved, but the problem from the start was that neither of us wanted biological children, and intended to adopt. Her mother had always been very adamant that she wanted biological grandchildren, and despite insisting that she wasn't homophobic, was furious when we got married and spent years demanding my wife have a child via sperm donor. Finally, my wife gave in because she had no health problems and was told it would be a safe pregnancy. Everything was fine until the birth itself.\n\nBecause I believe her mother is responsible for her death, I informed her that she would not be told where the funeral is taking place (it was a small, private service, after which I and my brother-in-law scattered her ashes in her favorite place), she would not be invited, and she would be told to leave should she try to show up, and the same goes for her husband. I have also made it clear that they will never have any contact with our daughter. I am considering filing a restraining order to keep her safe. They're furious and I have blocked their numbers, but fortunately most of my in-laws agree with my decision. My brother-in-law has completely cut contact with them.\n\nThey didn't come to the funeral, but have since been telling everyone they know that I'm a heartless monster who denied them closure and I'm denying them access to their granddaughter out of spite. I've lost some friends over this, and my mother is saying that even if they're terrible people, they deserved a chance to tell their daughter goodbye. AITA?\n\nEDIT because several people are asking:\n\n1. When I say that my wife \"finally\" decided to carry a child: she maintained for years that she wanted to adopt when we were older and more financially secure. She was always clear that she never wanted to be pregnant. When we started seriously talking about adopting, four years ago, her mother began calling, texting, and dropping by to visit several times a week to guilt-trip and harass her into carrying a child. \"Finally\" means she gave into pressure after four years.\n2. When my wife announced our engagement, her father initially refused to attend the wedding. He did end up coming, but he did not walk her down the aisle. He has spoken to me a handful of times in the 8 years we've been married. I have never been invited to their house.\n3. BIL was low-contact with them already, due to emotional abuse in his adolescence. From my understanding, my wife was the \"golden child\" and felt pressured to live up to their expectations.\n4. To people asking what my wife would want: I don't know. I can't ask her. What I know is that these people relentlessly pressured her into carrying a child, have been nothing but cold to me, and have gone on Facebook rants about how children need a mother and a father to raise them. While my wife was pregnant, her mother kept talking about her moving back in with them so they could help with the baby, asking who the baby's \"father figure\" would be, and even drunkenly suggested my wife try to meet the sperm donor to see if \"you two hit it off\".", "created_utc": 1667671193, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn1amo/aita_for_banning_my_deceased_wifes_parents_from/", "score": 1707, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I guess I wanted to speak to that for a moment: I think many of us can at least identify with the idea of an adult making decisions to placate a parent even if they're directly opposite our personal beliefs, and we can even speak to ways in which that decision might have felt especially loaded due to family trauma or general dynamics.\n\nFor people in the LGBT community, you're given an additional layer here: one in which, as much as we tell ourselves it's different, you are still in a group of people discriminated against and mistreated (more and more openly of late, in fact). As such, parental acceptance is an especially fraught deal. I remember talking to my mom about the gender affirming surgery I was having - that she strenuously objected to - and having her say things like \"promise this is the ONLY thing you'll do to your body\" and \"promise you'll NEVER change your name, because you're not allowed to\" and actually thinking for a moment in time that I should just fucking promise her that to get her to stop making me hate myself for making the decisions I needed to make.\n\nSo, then, I can imagine for your wife it might have felt like: they already barely accept me. I'm scared of losing them and of losing whatever tenuous shred of validation I already have. I guess if this keeps the peace, and is still meeting our ultimate goal of having a child, maybe this solves it. Yes, of course your wife had bodily autonomy and still made her choice.

Tragically it does happen, but we're talking about something like a 0.017% of childbirths that result in the mother's death in the US, and that's actually significantly higher than most other highly developed countries. So obviously the parents couldn't have reasonably expected this to happen.\n\nIn terms of the implication (OP's, not yours) that the parents are homophobic, if true that would be a much bigger issue for me than the fact that they pressured their daughter to give them a grandchild. But I don't think we really have enough information here to say that the parents are homophobic. OP says that the parents claim not to be homophobic, but that there were furious when OP married their daughter. But we don't know why the parents were furious. The implication from OP is that they were furious because it was a gay marriage, but it's possible they were furious for some other reason (maybe they just didn't like OP, maybe they thought they were too young, or [insert any of the many reasons parents often don't want their child marrying a particular person]).", "I understand where OP is coming from, but preventing parents to go to their child\u2019s funeral and not allowing any contact with their grandchild for something that was completely out of their control is extremely cruel. \nOP is TA", ">Suing OP for \"Grandparent's rights\" to get visitation/custody is going to be very expensive and very difficult when their entire family agrees with OP's decision and have gone NC/LC with them.\n\nAlso iirc grandparents rights are when they (grandparents) already have a relationship with their grandchild/ren, like if their adult child dies and the custody is granted to the living parent and maybe said parent is blocking them from seeing those grandchildren they already formed a bond with, in this case OOP won't let them in from the very start no matter what, also we don't know if this right is enforced by the laws where they live, maybe that's not even a thing there.", "Grandparents\u2019 rights are only granted if they\u2019ve been a part of the child\u2019s life and can prove the child will be better off due to their presence.

But they didn't force their hand. Don't let OP glaze over the fact that her and wife made the decision to do this. I'm sure they discussed it thoroughly, ran tests at the doctor, contemplated, etc. This was a decision OP and wife ultimately made together. They went to the appointments and procedures with a sperm donor. \nOP's wife wasn't dragged by the hand and forced to do this. \n\nYes the parents are assholes for pressuring their daughter to give birth to a biological child, but I guarantee they didn't want or expect the outcome to be losing her. Period. They still loved their daughter and deserve closure, in my opinion.", "It's not about them having a say. It's about them attending their daughters funeral. Yes they sucked for pressuring their daughter to have a biological child. But she also could've shut it down if she didn't want that. \n\nOP and wife made the ultimate decision to go through this procedure and give birth. None of them could've predicted losing her because of it. I guess they could have their own funeral of sorts.

Don't be a bell-end, a days old baby has no concept of mother, and if the baby is never told, wouldn't even know of this person's existence. The parents are in far more grief here.

There is no such right.", "The parents may have talked their daughter into carrying a child, but the doctors also told her there was almost no obvious risk to be expected. Complications during child birth are sometimes outside of the control of anyone.  The parents deserve to mourn their loss as well. Demanding space afterwards or even cutting off communication is fine, but don't discount their feelings.", "Sure they deserve to grieve, but what makes you think they're entitled to wedge themselves into OP's life and the funeral? Sure I feel bad for the parents to some degree but on the other hand I have no tolerance for self entitled people who refuse to acknowledge the consequences of their actions, they're not even at self aware enough to apologize to OP. They can grieve but it will have to be with those who still find their presence tolerable", "Just because it's normal doesn't mean it's acceptable or that you can immediately expect others to tolerate your behavior, OP is under no obligation to forgive them for the pressure they put on their wife which ultimately resulted in their death. Again, intent is absolutely irrelevant here.

People confess to murders they haven't committed because the cops just kept telling them they did it and they'd be better off just admitting it. Coercion doesn't take a lot, if you have enough time and power over someone (like a parent over their child for instance) you can make them say yes to just about anything regardless of how much they don't want to do it. We would all like to think we have a stronger will than we actually do. Coercion may not be \"force\" but if the result is the same it's a distinction without a difference.", "My point is Intentions are subjective and often times if you believe in something fanatically you can easily corrupt/warp your intent into something sinister or it can just lead to horrible consequences.

These wounds may get better with time but as someone who has lost many people in their life i can tell you this with 100% certainty. The more they try to force this relationship now the less likely OP is going to be to EVER forgive them, what they're doing no doubt feels very invasive to OP, I know this because I know the resentment that's building in her quite well and there's a definitely a point of no return. The parents need to back off and maybe attempt reconciliation when op has had time to process her situation.
