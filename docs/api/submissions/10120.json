Jay needs some self reflection", "NTA. Everbody's entitled to their opinion, but you have the right to call them out on their double standards.", "NTA.\n\nHe said something ridiculous, you laughed.    Not your fault he's not happy with his bs being exposed.", "NTA, and I am grinning, and have the sudden urge to buy you a beer.\n\n(There's nothing wrong with having a high body count, as long as you're honest and open and not hypocritical about it.  Jay sounds like a jackass, by my standards.)", "NTA, you giggled and they asked. You also did not directly say it but did call out his misogyny in a funny way.", "Both of you are slut-shaming here, but you\u2019re NTA for this. You laughed and were asked to explain why. He\u2019s just mad that his hypocrisy c*ckblocked him", "NTA. Screw Jay and his hypocritical BS.", "NTA - at first I thought this was going to be a jealousy issue from the headline - but seems like all you did was laugh when he said something ridiculous.  Maybe he shouldn\u2019t say stupid shit if he wants to get a higher body count. LMAO", "NTA \n\nLets put it this way, someone says \"I would never date a girl with over 10 plants.\" \n\n\"You have 15 plants\"\n\n\"Why are you putting down the number of plants that I have!!!\"", "NTA , all you did was giggle. They asked and you gave an honest answer", "nta\n\nnot being honest to get sex is such a turn on... \\^\\^", "NTA. It's not your fault that he said something so ridiculously funny that it made you involuntarily laugh. You just told another joke in return.", "NTA, as a woman i'd surely like to know I was being deceived by some fuck boy with double standards (feel like somehow they're always like that).\n\nTo those saying shes the AH, and somehow defending this misogynistic pig that would've gotten laid, start thinking less with your balls.", "YTA - there is a term for what you did C\\*\\*\\* Block.  Not your place to bring up his history to someone he is interested in.", "YTA because he's supposed to be your friend and you cockblocked him..   \nI have no opinion on any of the other details and feel they are irrelevant.", "NTA\n\nHis hypocrisy should get called out", "NTA, your friend has a double standard and is being misogynistic and you shut it down. he needs to get off his high horse.", "ESH.\n\nHe's a hypocrite, but both of you engaged in slut-shaming.", "Info: what is a body count?\n\nThe only context springing to mind is game based like COD or EFT and I'm guessing that wasn't your meaning\n\nEither that or you're a bunch of adolescent murderers?", "Shaming people because they have a vagina for sleeping with more than 10+ people, when he has done the same, is gross. \n\nWhy should he be held to any different standards?\n\nNTA", "NTA--- Don't throw stones in glass houses. He is sexist and deserved to be called out.", "You should have asked what an acceptable number is for men? \n\nDown with hypocrisy! People commenting slut shaming is confusing.

I understand however that you have different values.", "You sounds just as misogynistic as OP's friend.

You were pointing out his hypocrisy.\n\nThe two are not the same. It's like being called racist for pointing out that someone is saying something racist.", "agreed! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", ":) must be tough being your friend given every person is a hypocrite at some level.", "It's not misogyny, it's his personal preference.
