We've been through thick and thin together. Enter Ana's boyfriend Todd (35M), and things have been... complicated.\n\nAna and Todd have been together for about three years now, but I've always felt uneasy about their relationship. There's a significant age gap between them, and Todd seems intent on pulling her away from her family and friends. He's been trying to convince her to uproot her life in Maine and move to Vegas. Maybe it's just me but it felt like Todd picked up a map and picked the farthest state he could, and I made this exact grievance to Ana but she wasn\u2019t trying to hear it.\n\nNow, let me tell you about Todd. He's generally a total douchebag. He's the kind of guy who talks about wanting a traditional wife, something that is completely opposite to Ana's personality and beliefs. It's like he doesn't really know her at all.\n\nThings took a crazy turn when a random girl DM\u2019d me on Instagram. She saw a picture of me and Todd at a party with a mutual friend and assumed I was his girlfriend. She sent me screenshots of texts, photos, and even video evidence of Todd with them (a literal sex tape). This was exactly two days before Todd proposed.\n\nFast forward to the proposal day, Todd invited both their families and friends for a surprise proposal. The thing is, nobody, not even myself, knew about this. He got down on one knee, and in my shock, I blurted out \"He's cheating on you!\" I didn't want Ana to make a massive mistake and get tied into a marriage with someone who clearly didn't deserve her. Looking back, I totally realize that I could have chosen a better moment to bring this up.\n\nAna was absolutely devastated. She was upset with me for ruining her proposal and embarrassing her in front of everyone. I mean, I get it. It's supposed to be a special moment, and I hijacked it in the worst possible way, but I think it was a necessary evil to get rid of Todd. It\u2019s been a month and Ana refuses to talk to me, but I sent her the proof (minus the sex tape of course), and learned through a mutual friend that they\u2019ve finally broken up.\n\n**TL;DR:** Best friend Ana's boyfriend Todd is sketchy, trying to pull her away from friends and family. Found out he's cheating on her two days before his surprise proposal. I blurted out the truth during the proposal, and now Ana's furious with me.

This action might make me the asshole because, regardless of my intentions, I disrupted what was meant to be a special and joyous moment for Ana. My timing was poor, and I didn't consider the emotional impact it would have on her and the people witnessing the proposal. While I genuinely wanted to protect Ana from a potentially bad decision, my method was inappropriate and overshadowed the positive event. Someone calling me an asshole for my actions made me consider that I prioritized my perspective over Ana's feelings in that moment, which may have been a mistake on my part.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her accepting the proposal in the moment doesn\u2019t man anything legally or otherwise. You should\u2019ve pulled her aside as soon as possible afterwards and provided the information you told us. This would place the decision of how and when to handle this in Ana\u2019s hands. Instead you absolutely humiliated her in front of of of those people. Having to break the engagement and explain to them why later would be difficult enough.", "NAH - I get it, you made a social blunder but reached the goal: Inform Anna.\n\nAnna's emotions are valid even if she ices you out.

I would send her a text telling her all the things about her that you think are amazing and wonderful and  which would be appreciated by another, better man because I suspect her self-esteem is low and she either doesn't know she can do better or doesn't know better exists...And also let her know that there is a sex tape if she'd like to see it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe probably won't listen. She's young, attached, and probably terrified of losing him. \"Love\" can be like a genuine drug addiction. She might even dump you to keep him and then years from now regret it.

I strongly suspect she is furious with you because you told her her bf was cheating in the worst way possible; at a proposal and in front of friends and family. How awful for her!! Can you not see how upsetting and humiliating that would be? Calling it a 'necessarily evil' doesn't exactly demonstrate remorse on your part. It wasn't 'necessary'; you could have told her before.

But that's also what he gets for being an AH too.", "NTA - If you only suspected he was cheating, and you'd done this, I would have said you were TA, but in the end, you probably saved her from a controlling, possibly abusive relationship.  I'd give her some space, so she can mourn, and then hope the friendship can be salvaged down the line.  If not, at least you know you saved her, even if it was at the cost of your friendship.", "YTA. You waited 2 days to tell her. If I'd learnt that my friend was being cheated on, my call to her would be immediate.", "YTA. You had two days to tell her and instead you held on to the information and used it to embarrass her in front of her loved ones. You know accepting a proposal doesn't mean you have to marry the person, right? Any time before or after the proposal would have been fine.", "YTA, You sound more like a jealous lover than a friend.  If you were going to spill the beans, you picked the absolute worst way to do it.  You managed to cause your friend more harm than she deserved.  Next time, either pass along this kind of news privately or mind your own business.", "ESH (Well, you and Todd. Neither Ana or the woman who got in touch are at all.)\n\nIt's not that you told her, it's that you publicly humiliated her after keeping it a secret from her for two days.\n\nSo yeah, I wouldn't be speaking to you either.", "YTA- if you were that upset over his cheating, why would you WAIT to tell your friend about it?", "YTA - this seems like something you would only see in a movie.  Proposals aren't marriage, you could have easily told her the next day.  Even if all this is true, and the dates line up, that would be so embarrassing, I would have a really hard time talking to you again.", "YTA for how you did it! You publicly humiliated your best friend. I completely get wanting to tell her and you should ofc But privately even if it was after she may of accepted his proposal and if you had to send the sex tape to her too. And why did you wait 2 whole days to tell her. I would if told her immediately after speaking with this random girl.", "I question your motives.  To me, it sounds like you were a little jealous of their relationship, and just looking for an excuse to hammer him, and so you got it and off you went.\n\nThe end result is a positive (they broke up), but YTA for the manner in which you participated.", "YTA. Not only did she find out her boyfriend was cheating but you humiliated her in the worst way possible. You needed to tell her before hand when you found out or after, but both needed to be privately.

Ana will forgive you sooner or later.", "I think it\u2019s a \u201cwhat are you gonna do\u201d moment. Idk why you didn\u2019t tell her sooner than the proposal, but it is good you didn\u2019t let her think she was engaged for a second. It sucks, but I believe you did your best I don\u2019t think you were malicious.", "I never understand why young women want these older men.", "Going against the grain here, NTA. Yes it was humiliating for her but that\u2019s better than the alternative. Sometimes a public \u2018outing\u2019 is the only thing that pushes someone to walk away from a bad relationship. If it wasn\u2019t in front of people, he would have talked her around and convinced her to accept the proposal. So many red flags in that relationship so yeah very hard for your friend but in the end she\u2019s better off but don\u2019t expect her to see this perspective. She\u2019s hurting and may not get over it but you \u2018saved\u2019 her (this time).", "YTA. You humiliated her. You could have told her literally at any other point privately or not by loudly blurting it out. I cannot fathom why you didn\u2019t tell her literally anywhere else.", "Being cheated on *shouldn\u2019t* be embarrassing, because you are right, but it *is* embarrassing for a large portion of people that get cheated on.", "i meant ashamed of how her \u201cbest friend\u201d acted, not that her exbf is a dirtbag.", "I move pretty fast and even I probably would have taken more than two days to figure out what I wanted to say and how to approach it. \n\nEspecially since I was probably living my life during those two days, and doing things and that's not a conversation I would want to have over text or phone. Taking your time to think about things before taking action isn't a crime - it's usually pretty helpful. And the OP didn't know there was a surprise proposal coming.", "But she didn\u2019t know about the proposal till it was happening. I suspect she spent those 2 days trying to figure out how to break the news, not deliberately waiting for the moment of maximum embarrassment.", "YTA You should have told her as soon as you could and privately.", "You didn\u2019t embarrass her! You saved her! I hope Todd was embarrassed to his toes and beyond. What a dick.", "You sacrificed your relationship with her to save her life. You're a true friend. NTA", "NTA.  I think you\u2019re NTA, b/c if she IS (was) in an abusive relationship and you told her privately, she would\u2019ve gone to him and he would\u2019ve said you\u2019re a liar, the person that sent the info is a liar, blah blah, LOVE BOMBS\u2026 But since ALL her family and friends witnessed her being told he was cheating, he had no way to handle the situation before anyone found out.", "YTA for how you told her. So thoughtless and inconsiderate to her feelings.", "YTA purely because you had two days to tell her, and instead humiliated her publicly.", "I can't believe you're 25. YTA.", "It was a \u201csurprise\u201d proposal. OP was not prepared and had not yet had a chance to intervene.", "Oh, ok. OP should have let her friend accept a proposal from a cheater. Is that right? No.", "I\u2019d still say YTA because saying yes to a proposal is not a legally binding contract in any way. She could\u2019ve let the proposal go through, let the night end, and then the next day, privately let her know.\n\nAt the very least then, even if she had said yes, she could still have some control over the narrative as to why they broke up after the engagemebt", "She literally had 2 days to do it. That's a \"I need to tell her this right now\" sort of situations", "She also had proof of cheating for literal days and didn't tell her best friend? Plenty of time to prepare for a phonecall", "lol, OP was not the main character here, keeping one\u2019s mouth closed is not a super power. all she had to do was wait until she was next alone with her \u2018best friend.\u2019 instead OP took the stage.", "She sat on the info for two days, if that was my friend and I received sex taps of their partner I would have told them immediately. Also, proposals aren\u2019t binding, OP had already waited two days with this info, why couldn\u2019t she have waited one more and told her in private instead of embarrassing her friend in front of family and friends? YTA", "Better late than never.", "In the face of a \u201csurprise\u201d you get what you get. Some people blurt out shit. And thank goodness OP kept her friend from accepting a proposal from a cheater. Who cares who is at center stage at that point?", "So you have perfect timing in all things? OP was not worried about her friend\u2019s reception of this news and so was hoping to find a good time to break the news? OP had no idea cheater was going to propose when he did, cut her a break.", "The most \"appropriate manner\" is immediately. Every second one of my supposed friends lets me continue to live a lie by not forwarding that proof is its own betrayal. OP is doubly TA.", "Better an hour later than at that moment as well. She had a good 50 hours to do it, and did it at the absolute worst moment with the least amount of tact.", "annnnnd \u2018blurting out shit\u2019 quite literally makes YTA :)", "Why would I cut her a break, she posted on a AITAH sub looking for honest feedback. There isn\u2019t a good time to break bad news to someone, but there is a bad time too, and she picked the worst time to do so.", "She only had a couple of days to try to figure out how she was going to tell her", "Oh well. Tragedy averted. Why is her friend embarrassed when it\u2019s her cheating boyfriend who should be?", "Uh much better to let her friend accept a proposal from a fcking cheater. Yeah? No.", "Well enjoy being wrong.", "Oof, I guess you can't relate to people in social situations.", "An accepted proposal isn't a requirement to marry someone. Let friend say yes, pull her aside ASAP and tell her. Then she can address the situation on her own terms instead of sharing the intimate details with everyone like OP did.", "What\u2019s more embarrassing, having a cheater outed in public or OP\u2019s friend having to explain over and over why the engagement was called off?", "Disagree. Better to avoid accepting a cheater\u2019s proposal than have to explain repeatedly why the engagement was called off.", "Option 2. It gives her friend the power instead of taking it away when she is vulnerable. Option 3 would be telling your supposed best friend immediately after finding out. Her delay in action there is the worst part, in my opinion."]}
