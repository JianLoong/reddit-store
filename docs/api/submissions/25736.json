We've been through thick and thin together. Enter Ana's boyfriend Todd (35M), and things have been... complicated.\n\nAna and Todd have been together for about three years now, but I've always felt uneasy about their relationship. There's a significant age gap between them, and Todd seems intent on pulling her away from her family and friends. He's been trying to convince her to uproot her life in Maine and move to Vegas. Maybe it's just me but it felt like Todd picked up a map and picked the farthest state he could, and I made this exact grievance to Ana but she wasn\u2019t trying to hear it.\n\nNow, let me tell you about Todd. He's generally a total douchebag. He's the kind of guy who talks about wanting a traditional wife, something that is completely opposite to Ana's personality and beliefs. It's like he doesn't really know her at all.\n\nThings took a crazy turn when a random girl DM\u2019d me on Instagram. She saw a picture of me and Todd at a party with a mutual friend and assumed I was his girlfriend. She sent me screenshots of texts, photos, and even video evidence of Todd with them (a literal sex tape). This was exactly two days before Todd proposed.\n\nFast forward to the proposal day, Todd invited both their families and friends for a surprise proposal. The thing is, nobody, not even myself, knew about this. He got down on one knee, and in my shock, I blurted out \"He's cheating on you!\" I didn't want Ana to make a massive mistake and get tied into a marriage with someone who clearly didn't deserve her. Looking back, I totally realize that I could have chosen a better moment to bring this up.\n\nAna was absolutely devastated. She was upset with me for ruining her proposal and embarrassing her in front of everyone. I mean, I get it. It's supposed to be a special moment, and I hijacked it in the worst possible way, but I think it was a necessary evil to get rid of Todd. It\u2019s been a month and Ana refuses to talk to me, but I sent her the proof (minus the sex tape of course), and learned through a mutual friend that they\u2019ve finally broken up.\n\n**TL;DR:** Best friend Ana's boyfriend Todd is sketchy, trying to pull her away from friends and family. Found out he's cheating on her two days before his surprise proposal. I blurted out the truth during the proposal, and now Ana's furious with me.

This action might make me the asshole because, regardless of my intentions, I disrupted what was meant to be a special and joyous moment for Ana. My timing was poor, and I didn't consider the emotional impact it would have on her and the people witnessing the proposal. While I genuinely wanted to protect Ana from a potentially bad decision, my method was inappropriate and overshadowed the positive event. Someone calling me an asshole for my actions made me consider that I prioritized my perspective over Ana's feelings in that moment, which may have been a mistake on my part.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n###[Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What exactly were you doing in the 2 days between when you received the info + sex tape and proposal day?  Besides not calling Ana?\n\nAnd then proposal day comes and you pick the cruelest way to blurt out the information in front of her family and friends.  Ana needed kindness and you opted for public humiliation.", "YTA for chosing the worst possible way to do it. You had other choices. You could have told her as soon as you knew and not waited for a such a public display or let her have her moment, told her after and your friend could have dealt with the situation however she saw fit.", "YTA\n\nA proposal isn't the same as a wedding ceremony and engagements can be broken. You were WRONG to do it when you did. You could have waited until later. Please apologize.", "NAH but I\u2019m not surprised about her reaction. I wish someone had told me sooner that my ex was cheating. But the way you went about it could\u2019ve been better. Scheduling a lunch with her the next day or something would\u2019ve been okay. But I also get why you panicked.", "Slight YTA\n\nI get that you didn't want her to say yes because you knew that he was cheating \n\nBut why didn't you tell her as soon as the person sent you the proof?\n\nInstead you humiliated her in front of friends and family", "YTA\n\nSo you decided to humiliate your friend in front of friends and family.", "YTA. Her accepting the proposal in the moment doesn\u2019t man anything legally or otherwise. You should\u2019ve pulled her aside as soon as possible afterwards and provided the information you told us. This would place the decision of how and when to handle this in Ana\u2019s hands. Instead you absolutely humiliated her in front of of of those people. Having to break the engagement and explain to them why later would be difficult enough.", "NAH - I get it, you made a social blunder but reached the goal: Inform Anna.\n\nAnna's emotions are valid even if she ices you out. You may regain this friendship but be patient.\n\n\\*\\*Why withhold the video? (just curious)", "i think NTA. \n\nif you did it the next day \u2014 she would\u2019ve been wearing and maybe attached to her ring, she would\u2019ve contacted more extended family, possibly started planning things like photo shoots. i know it\u2019s unfortunate and embarrassing for her but to me, i\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t even get that ring onto her finger before she found out. \n\nhopefully in time, she can forgive you.", "NTA. Your timing totally sucked. But - you saved Ana years/decades of pain/unhappiness at the cost of your friendship. That's a true friend. You did good.", "NAH (except for Todd). You were trying to protect her from what sounds like not only a cheater but a potential abuser.  I would send her a text telling her all the things about her that you think are amazing and wonderful and  which would be appreciated by another, better man because I suspect her self-esteem is low and she either doesn't know she can do better or doesn't know better exists...And also let her know that there is a sex tape if she'd like to see it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe probably won't listen. She's young, attached, and probably terrified of losing him. \"Love\" can be like a genuine drug addiction. She might even dump you to keep him and then years from now regret it. But you sound like a good friend and you can only do your best. YOU are definitely NTA. Only Todd qualifies and I'm sorry for both you and your friend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I just noticed you said they broke up. You did her a lifetime favor.", "NTA. Your timing sucked, but she needed to know. It was a surprise proposal so you were taken off guard and I guess panicked. She's no doubt humiliated and will need time to come to terms with it. But you did the right thing.", "All those People giving you the asshole verdict are missing the point on this facts.\n\n1) You should have inform Anna immediately and probably this was the first opportunity you had.\n\n2) You were caught off guard and reacted at the spur of the moment.\n\nYou did humiliate your friend and probably should have waited to be alone with her and even show the sex tape, but I cannot call you the asshole for making a judgement spur of the moment mistake, specially because you felt there was no way out, you saw this abusive man aislating your friend for her support network, and your desperation took your best judgement, even if Anna doesn't want to be your friend any more, you saved her from a marriage of abuse, if she can't see that maybe in a couple months when she was a cool head to analyze what happened, then good riddance.\n\nYou should probably learn to be more discreet about things, but that doesn't make you the asshole, You wanted to save your friend. NTA", "YTA you could have done it better.", "I have to say YTA. I don't believe Ana isn't furious with you for 'wrecking the proposal'. I strongly suspect she is furious with you because you told her her bf was cheating in the worst way possible; at a proposal and in front of friends and family. How awful for her!! Can you not see how upsetting and humiliating that would be? Calling it a 'necessarily evil' doesn't exactly demonstrate remorse on your part. It wasn't 'necessary'; you could have told her before. You could have dragged her outside and told her in private. There were options here.\n\nWhy couldn't you have told her before? You sat on this information for two days.", "A soft YTA for doing it in front of all parties. You should have told her as soon as you found out, so she could've done her own investigating as well. It's better for her to know now rather than 2 years from now when she's stranded in Vegas with little ones and no support, so in that regard, NTA, but yeah, you could've gone about it better that doing it during the actual proposal. But that's also what he gets for being an AH too.", "NTA - If you only suspected he was cheating, and you'd done this, I would have said you were TA, but in the end, you probably saved her from a controlling, possibly abusive relationship.  I'd give her some space, so she can mourn, and then hope the friendship can be salvaged down the line.  If not, at least you know you saved her, even if it was at the cost of your friendship.", "YTA. You waited 2 days to tell her. If I'd learnt that my friend was being cheated on, my call to her would be immediate.", "YTA. You had two days to tell her and instead you held on to the information and used it to embarrass her in front of her loved ones. You know accepting a proposal doesn't mean you have to marry the person, right? Any time before or after the proposal would have been fine.", "YTA, You sound more like a jealous lover than a friend.  If you were going to spill the beans, you picked the absolute worst way to do it.  You managed to cause your friend more harm than she deserved.  Next time, either pass along this kind of news privately or mind your own business.", "ESH (Well, you and Todd. Neither Ana or the woman who got in touch are at all.)\n\nIt's not that you told her, it's that you publicly humiliated her after keeping it a secret from her for two days.\n\nSo yeah, I wouldn't be speaking to you either.", "YTA- if you were that upset over his cheating, why would you WAIT to tell your friend about it?", "YTA - this seems like something you would only see in a movie.  Proposals aren't marriage, you could have easily told her the next day.  Even if all this is true, and the dates line up, that would be so embarrassing, I would have a really hard time talking to you again.", "YTA for how you did it! You publicly humiliated your best friend. I completely get wanting to tell her and you should ofc But privately even if it was after she may of accepted his proposal and if you had to send the sex tape to her too. And why did you wait 2 whole days to tell her. I would if told her immediately after speaking with this random girl.", "I question your motives.  To me, it sounds like you were a little jealous of their relationship, and just looking for an excuse to hammer him, and so you got it and off you went.\n\nThe end result is a positive (they broke up), but YTA for the manner in which you participated.", "YTA. Not only did she find out her boyfriend was cheating but you humiliated her in the worst way possible. You needed to tell her before hand when you found out or after, but both needed to be privately. That is not only super traumatic what you did but is just very immature.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
