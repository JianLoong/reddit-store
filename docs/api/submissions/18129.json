Your mom doesn't live WITH you?  How often does she visit?  Could you board the cat when she visits plus keep a bedroom cat free to make it work? (I guess that depends on how severe her allergies are)  \n\n\nNTA in my opinion, since she doesn't want you to have a pet because she might want to visit sometimes.   I'd feel differently if she lived with you full time and you wanted to bring a cat into the house.", "NTA \n\nYour home, your pet.", "NTA. Your mom can't expect you to never have pets as an adult in your own house just because she's allergic. You can visit her instead or like you said, the cat-free room or help put her up in a nice hotel", "NTA.  Live your life let other people adjust. Your mom is not your roommate or life partner.", "NTA.  Your house and you deserve to get a cat if you want too.  The mom can stay at a hotel when she visits.", "NTA you are a grown adult living in your own home and she visits a couple times a year- enjoy your cat.", "That\u2019s your baby \ud83d\udda4 you\u2019re allowed to have whatver pets you want as you\u2019re an adult and you pay for your own place. It\u2019s awesome that you care for your mom but you shouldn\u2019t have to give your cat up. No. You\u2019re not the Ahole. If it bothers her that much, she can stay at an air bnb, different family members place, or nearby hotel. That\u2019s just my opinion", "NTA, it\u2019s her allergy and your house.", "My relatives got a cat. We close to each other. I'm highly allergic. I used to visit regularly, but since they got the cat I grew tired of always having to take allergy medicine and just stopped visiting.\n\nEdit nta", "NTA, you can get a cat if you want one, but you should also be able to acknowledge that this could be hurtful to your mum as you know this could prevent her from visiting. Yes you have offered to keep a room pet free but if she is visiting are you expecting her to just sit in a guest bedroom the entire time she is there? Also a lot of people are saying she can just get a hotel, this isn't something financially available to everyone.", "NTA, your mom doesn\u2019t need to stay with you. She can get a hotel and you can meet outside the home when she comes to visit. Adult cats have a hard time getting adopted too, glad you found her and can give her a loving home!", "NTA - you don't have viable alternatives for the cat that aren't cruel. Your mum can always stay at a hotel or airbnb when she visits.", "NTA I\u2019m mildly allergic to cats and still own two sweet boys \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.\n\nAs you\u2019ve said, you don\u2019t live together and live thousands of miles apart. You shouldn\u2019t *not have a pet* because of her allergies, I say this as someone with animal allergies.\n\nIf you lived together, it would be different, but you don\u2019t.", "NTA. I think maintaining a cat-free guest room is a great idea. You can't really let your mom's allergy dictate whether or not you own a pet, especially since she doesn't live with you. It's really sort of selfish of her to expect that.", "NTA. I was all set to day the contrary since I thought, given that you\u2019re even wondering about this, that you lived with your mother. But yeah, no. It\u2019s your house. You live very very far away. If you want to keep the car, keep the cat.", "NTA! OP, I briefly looked at your profile (I was looking for pics of the cat) and it looks like you're struggling at the moment. I think you need that cat just as much as it needs you.\n\nI took in a feral shortly after I was disabled in a car accident. I was struggling to adjust, and my depression became overwhelming. That feral cat turned into the biggest lap cat in existence and got me through it. She passed last year at the age of 18, and I still cry thinking about her. She helped me heal when I needed it the most. I hope your cat can do the same for you \ud83d\udc9c", "GET THE CAT", "NTA; it's your house, mom doesn't live with you. She can take pills or stay at a hotel when she comes to visit.", "Following this one with interest as I\u2019ve been on the other side of this situation. My mom got a dog just before the pandemic, despite knowing that my husband was allergic to dogs. We\u2019d talked previously about the fact that getting a dog would mean we wouldn\u2019t be able to visit the house, but she still bought a dog anyway. It means now that the only time we ever see her is when she comes to us (she hates driving and won\u2019t be away from the dog for long) so it\u2019s heavily limited how often we can see her. That said, she loves the dog and devotes lots of time and attention to it, and she obviously sees it everyday whereas even if it weren\u2019t there we still wouldn\u2019t be seeing her super frequently.\n\nSo it makes us sad that we can\u2019t visit, especially as she knew about the allergies but still got the dog. It felt quite deliberate at the time even though we basically didn\u2019t factor into the decision, so I fully understand what your mom is going through. Equally a lot of other people have a point - it\u2019s your home and you love the cat, of course you should keep it if you want to. Maybe just give your mom lots of reassurance that you\u2019ll see her just as often because you\u2019ll travel to her more, or she can stay in a nearby hotel when she comes to you and you can both spend time out and about. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sense of \u201centitlement\u201d driving her feelings - she probably just feels like you\u2019ve made a conscious choice that excludes her from your home. Just reassure her otherwise and be prepared to try a bit harder to see her on non-cat territory \u2764\ufe0f NAH", "I am also allergic to animals. I have a dog and a cat and this is how I cope. I love animals! So I vacuum regularly and I wash my hands immediately after any cuddling and petting them. Also I take antihistamines when I need them. YNA ! Edit- I don\u2019t allow them in bedrooms, or any sleeping areas", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA. Thanks for rescuing the kitty from the streets.", "NTA. Especially when you're not even live together and offered to keep your room cat free. Mothers usually like that.

I think the cat free room is a great idea as well as looking into tips and tricks for reducing the amount of allergen present in common areas during visits. \n\nIf you're close with your mum I can understand why she would be upset that she can't see you in the same way anymore but sometimes things like that change with time as children grow up and move on with their lives", ">even though I offered to keep one of my two bedrooms cat free for her to stay in.\n\nI'm allergic to cats and this would never work for me.
