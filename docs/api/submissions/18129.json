I think you need that cat just as much as it needs you.\n\nI took in a feral shortly after I was disabled in a car accident. I was struggling to adjust, and my depression became overwhelming. That feral cat turned into the biggest lap cat in existence and got me through it. She passed last year at the age of 18, and I still cry thinking about her. She helped me heal when I needed it the most. I hope your cat can do the same for you \ud83d\udc9c", "GET THE CAT", "NTA; it's your house, mom doesn't live with you. She can take pills or stay at a hotel when she comes to visit.", "Following this one with interest as I\u2019ve been on the other side of this situation. My mom got a dog just before the pandemic, despite knowing that my husband was allergic to dogs. We\u2019d talked previously about the fact that getting a dog would mean we wouldn\u2019t be able to visit the house, but she still bought a dog anyway. It means now that the only time we ever see her is when she comes to us (she hates driving and won\u2019t be away from the dog for long) so it\u2019s heavily limited how often we can see her. That said, she loves the dog and devotes lots of time and attention to it, and she obviously sees it everyday whereas even if it weren\u2019t there we still wouldn\u2019t be seeing her super frequently.\n\nSo it makes us sad that we can\u2019t visit, especially as she knew about the allergies but still got the dog. It felt quite deliberate at the time even though we basically didn\u2019t factor into the decision, so I fully understand what your mom is going through. Equally a lot of other people have a point - it\u2019s your home and you love the cat, of course you should keep it if you want to. Maybe just give your mom lots of reassurance that you\u2019ll see her just as often because you\u2019ll travel to her more, or she can stay in a nearby hotel when she comes to you and you can both spend time out and about. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sense of \u201centitlement\u201d driving her feelings - she probably just feels like you\u2019ve made a conscious choice that excludes her from your home. Just reassure her otherwise and be prepared to try a bit harder to see her on non-cat territory \u2764\ufe0f NAH", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We don't need to be in the cat's presence to be affected; if hair/dander/dried saliva from when they rub their faces on things to scent them is present in the environment, it can trigger the more sensitive end of the allergic spectrum, and those substances travel on people, on objects, and in the air. Every time you even open the door to that room, allergens will get in  and they accumulate to allergy-triggering levels surprisingly quickly.
