That feral cat turned into the biggest lap cat in existence and got me through it. She passed last year at the age of 18, and I still cry thinking about her.

She can take pills or stay at a hotel when she comes to visit.", "Following this one with interest as I\u2019ve been on the other side of this situation. My mom got a dog just before the pandemic, despite knowing that my husband was allergic to dogs. We\u2019d talked previously about the fact that getting a dog would mean we wouldn\u2019t be able to visit the house, but she still bought a dog anyway. It means now that the only time we ever see her is when she comes to us (she hates driving and won\u2019t be away from the dog for long) so it\u2019s heavily limited how often we can see her. That said, she loves the dog and devotes lots of time and attention to it, and she obviously sees it everyday whereas even if it weren\u2019t there we still wouldn\u2019t be seeing her super frequently.\n\nSo it makes us sad that we can\u2019t visit, especially as she knew about the allergies but still got the dog. It felt quite deliberate at the time even though we basically didn\u2019t factor into the decision, so I fully understand what your mom is going through. Equally a lot of other people have a point - it\u2019s your home and you love the cat, of course you should keep it if you want to. Maybe just give your mom lots of reassurance that you\u2019ll see her just as often because you\u2019ll travel to her more, or she can stay in a nearby hotel when she comes to you and you can both spend time out and about. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sense of \u201centitlement\u201d driving her feelings - she probably just feels like you\u2019ve made a conscious choice that excludes her from your home. Just reassure her otherwise and be prepared to try a bit harder to see her on non-cat territory \u2764\ufe0f NAH", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Every time you even open the door to that room, allergens will get in  and they accumulate to allergy-triggering levels surprisingly quickly.

It\u2019s not her house, it\u2019s not even her STATE. She should get no say", "Gosh I seem to have struck a nerve here, that\u2019s a lot of frustration on behalf of my mom! I think you have misread my post anyway, because I actually said that both OP and my mom obviously have every right to their pets. \n\nWhat I was attempting to highlight was that in doing so it\u2019s inevitable that the family member with allergies will feel sad about it. That doesn\u2019t go away just because an adult is entitled to take in a pet. I guess, imagine you have a serious nut allergy, and your family member invites you to eat with them from time to time. Imagine that the whole of their life, this family member has never had nuts in their kitchen, so you delight in going to their home and eating with them and spending time catching up with them. Then one day they decide they want to start using nuts in their kitchen. Of course they can, it\u2019s their kitchen! You can\u2019t tell them not to! But as a human being it\u2019s natural that you feel sad that this now means you can\u2019t eat anything they make in that kitchen anymore. There are probably ways around it - you invite them to your home, to a restaurant out.. but it\u2019s normal to feel put out that the new thing they\u2019ve taken on would cause you medical problems.\n\nRe-read my post because I stated NAH and offered a different perspective. I think there\u2019s room for empathy towards OP\u2019s mom but I never said she shouldn\u2019t keep the cat."]}
