It's a 24-7 job because even though they are at school and you are at work, you are still worried about them.  I'm a parent. I love my son. I need a break sometimes. Just because I'm a parent doesn't mean I can't enjoy a party anymore or I have to want to be around my kids all the time. Everyone seems to think that because I am a mother that I have to stop being a regular person, I can't drink, and I have to wear cardigans and flats every day! No,  that's not how it works! \n\nI like to have fun at parties too but I usually get a babysitter and leave my son at home. If he comes along with us,  Sometimes my husband will drink and I will take care of our son. And other times I will drink and he will care for our son.  If a family member watches him, it has been arranged in advance and they are compensated.  \n\nBut what my family does when we have parties is hire a babysitter to take care of the kids. We bring her food. (I say her because it's the same person all the time.) And whoever is sober gives her a few breaks.  If there will be a lot of kids the sitter brings her sister and we pay both of them. Our friends always venmo us at the end of the night to help cover the costs. But I would still do it even if they didn't  I want my guests to have fun.\n\nSo this isn't a case of bad parenting... Or people who shouldn't have kids...
