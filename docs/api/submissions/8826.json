I got this way when my friend got a girlfriend and wanted to talk about her all the time. Two, if she knows your partner (maybe she won\u2019t admit it, but knows him from somewhere else) she has feelings for him? She is turning down dates, which seems strange. This may lead to my third suspicion, which is that she is in a poor mental state. Check in on her, I think that may help with all three of these possibilities. \n\n\nThis seems really strange and if you\u2019re not bringing someone else into her space, I really don\u2019t see a reason to be upset with you. \n\nNAH.", "NTA.

The problem here is because you have known each other since you were 11 and probably have been single for a while if you haven't dated anyone since high school, means your entire friendship both of you have been single. I went through this where my friend had a boyfriend then when I got a boyfriend and she became single she became fuming to the point where I couldn't even talk about him. At the time I didn't understand why she couldn't be happy for me, but at the same time, you never know the hurt that they feel because of how lonely they truly are. It is not fair for her to unload all of her dirty laundry on you. Although as a friend, I think you really need to evaluate why she's upset over this situation.

She feels like she is losing the only person she has. I bet seeing you break out of 7 years of  singleness and leaving her behind upsets her but that\u2019s her problem to deal with. \n\nShe might actually like you as well. Nothing you can do about that either if you are not interested in her in that way.\n\nChat with her, tell her how excited you are about the new relationship and how perhaps sometimes the three of you can do things together.  \n\nWork out, what it looks like to have guests in your apartment. She cannot be the sole person to say guests can come over or stay.", "NTA. This is super common among friends who grow older, often when one of two less-social people becomes more social, but it can happen in a variety of circumstances. When one person starts to get in shape, or starts dating, or starts succeeding at a shared dream career, it causes a lot of emotion in the person who thought you both were 'in the same boat.' Clearly, she wishes she were in a relationship, but has some sort of block on getting into one. Not dating between high school and 26 is pretty atypical, to say the least.\n\nShe's going to need to get used to it because it's unreasonable for your boyfriend not to have seen your apartment. Hopefully she gets past it, and you'll need to have a talk with her, but this might just be a rift in your friendship. People just become different, and mid-20s is often when that's most visible. I mean, when you meet people at 11, you're nowhere near the same people you'll be at 25 or 35.\n\nAlso, I'm guessing Reddit is going to assume she's in love with you because they correctly guessed that a woman's husband was gay and in love with his best friend *one time*, but I don't really see anything here to jump to that conclusion.", "NTA but maybe she\u2019s actually in love with you? That\u2019s still not your problem but could explain her ridiculous behavior.", "NTA.

That's a HER problem. \n\nTho you may be aggravatig the problem too. She said youre flaunting your relationship in front of her. How exactly? Maybe you just keep on talking about your boyfriend all the time. Every oncr in a while is fine but even I would get annoyed if my friends keep on making their boyfriend and being on a relationship a personality. Don't tell her your plans if she isnt asking. Stay with topics you both enjoy\n\nIf you arent excessively talking about your boyfriend and your relationship, then youre fine. Don't force her to meet your boyfriend either, that's just gonna end badly. If she doesnt have a lot of friends, she may be jealous not just because you have a boyfriend but also because she feels like she's taking the backseat and she doesnt like that. Make sure that you still do lots of fun things with her. Mingling your friend and boyfriend can come later.", "NTA.  And time to move out.", "Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius.", "INFO is this behavior out of character for her? Or have you simply overlooked her selfish behavior over the years?\n\nIf this is new for her, then you can be understanding, caring, and patient, letting her know that you love her, and that you can both work it out slowly over time at her pace. That for your part, you will try to ignore her snarky behavior, and will instead continue to offer solutions to her uncomfortable feelings of loneliness.\n\nBut if you have overlooked her selfish behavior over the years, and just now find it to be offensive, you can be less patient and more straight forward, offering her an opportunity to move forward with you as a friend, or, offer her the chance to begin her new lifestyle without you being as close as you are now.\n\nEither way, make it clear you will be dating your boyfriend, having fun, and enjoying time with him.", "NTA....it sounds like the two of you have been happily single together....now that you are getting serious about this guy it's going to change the dynamic of your relationship and she is going to be left behind.

He\u2019s from out of town about an hour and 45 mins away and has no connection to either of the industries my roommate and work in, so there\u2019s like a 0.0001% chance she knows him at all.

I pay more in rent, cover all the utilities, bought all the furniture that\u2019s in our shared space, and all our kitchen appliances because she couldn\u2019t afford it when she moved in and I could so for all intents and purposes a majority of the apartment/things in it mostly mine!

This has been a build up of nearly two months of her being passive-aggressive about me dating. I\u2019ve tried to bring it up with her before, reassures her that she isn\u2019t losing me, but she never wants to talk about it.

She gets matches all the time and gets asked out, but she never goes! I\u2019ve even offered to be in disguise and a few tables over to make sure she\u2019s comfortable but she just shrugs it off and ghosts them. \n\nI rarely bring him up, if I\u2019m honest, because I know the reaction I get from her when I do. I also only tend to see him once a week or so as he lives a bit away and we both work full time. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m out with him every night. 6/7 days of the week (sometimes 5 if I go to his) is spent with her. \n\nI was on the phone to my sister the other day in my room and was talking about the show him and I are going to this week and I came out of my room to find her completely ignoring me when I started talking to her about something else. It\u2019s honestly bizarre!", "Ooo okay a different opinion. Can you elaborate a little more?? I agree that I shouldn\u2019t have snapped at her, but I don\u2019t see how this makes me a *huge* ass hole.

If she doesn't want to be friendly with him, she doesn't have to. But she doesn't get to dictate your life either. She can stay in her room or go out when he's there if she really must. Or she could move out and take her crappy attitude elsewhere. \n\nShe doesn't get to decide who you get to spend time with, and or who you let in your house - it's perfectly normal to have your partner over. It's not like you're inviting a random stranger to live with you. If she's so uncomfortable having other people around she's going to have to go and live by herself.

Move out so that you can live without worrying about the reactions of someone you have no control over, and who's stifling your ability to live the life you want to live.", "Well then, she absolutely needs some counseling. You can suggest it, but can't make her do it. However, you are entitled to bring over your boyfriend whenever you want, besides just to meet her because you wanted to share this good thing in your life with her, and need to tell her, in a calm but matter of fact way that you aren't limiting your life to suit her personal emotional issues.", "Those are reasonable wants.", "That is bizarre but it also kinda points out to something more than being jealous that youre in a relationship. It can be something like what the other people said, that she likes you but it can also be sometning else. How's the friendship dynamic before your boyfriend was in the future? I know of some people who can't be happy of their friends' achievements in general because they're just jealous of the person in general, an inferiority complex or the opposite and they were surprised and mad because between the two of you, youre the first one who got a boyfriend and that didnt sit well with them since they think theyre better.\n\nThat's toxic. Have you tried asking her if she has any other problems with you? If you ask her point blank and she wouldnt tell you or just get mad, i honestly just would have left it at that.  Stop concerning yourself about her. If she ignores you, ignore her back. Two can play that game. It might give her something to think about. I also have friends I am friends with for more than a decade and I'd rather compromise than get into an argument, but it does happen sometimes. Sometimes it's for the better and a few weeks apart (metaphorically, in your case since you live together) can do good or sometimes it just breaks.\n\nAlso, stop caring about her relationship. If she starts complaining about it, the petty on me suggests to roll your eyes at her too. See how she likes that. The disguise thing is funny tho, if a friend offered me that i would totally go out on a date with a random just to see that.", "To elaborate I meant that if you noticed her attitude towards your romantic activities ( not agreeing with her pov but acknowledging it) it just seems very unwise to get her involved at all despite how you feel about her opinion.

We are both theatre performers and trying to do it professionally while working our big girl jobs! I tend to book often within my niche (funny fat best friend) and she has difficulties getting cast despite being conventionally attractive and super talented, so I do more work than her in that sense. She always gets annoyed by that! \n\nMy eyes are opening up to this maybe not being the most healthy friendship lol", "This might be the case, except for the part where the friend is on dating apps but basically actively refusing to date at all.

I don't know your friend, but there are friendship dynamics out there where youre not in the same page, and aren't equal. I don't wanna bad mouth a girl I dont know but if she is the type that can be narcissistic or at the very least feels superior to you, you might want to start looking for other friends. I won't say ditch her unless the relationship isnt salvageable anymore, but I think that may take a turn for the worse before it gets better, if it gets better. Your friend is starting to realize that being pretty and talented isnt enough anymore and things arent just going to fall on her lap. \n\nTo me that explains her relationship dilemma too, seems to me like she wants someone to take care of her, hence a relationship but she doesnt want to make a move and thinks people would just naturally gravitate towards her. Her attitude probably leaves a lot to be desired too if she can't even be happy youre getting jobs. She can be a little bit jealous about it, but annoyed?

Based on some of the replies you made in the thread, I'm going to guess that your roommate has been struggling but in a bit of denial about how bad it is, and you being mostly available to her and you not having a romantic relationship has let her get away with hiding from herself.  You having exciting things happen beyond your friendship may be making it harder for her to keep denying that she is not doing well.\n2. Just an experience from my life, which is why I'm biassed to think about what I said in point 1.    When we got engaged, my wife of course asked her oldest friend (from middle school) to be her maid of honour.  Said friend was  ... not great about it.  In fact she gave no support and was more of a burden.  Finally not long before the wedding they had a heart to heart, and the friend said roughly \"I was supposed to get married first.  I'm taller, thinner, and blonde.  I would have found someone nice for you after.\"  Obviously super messed up thinking, but the friend had this whole set of expectations in her head and didn't deal well when they were undermined.  I think my wife getting this going really threatened her friend's self-esteem.

And while that is okay for anyone to have their own issues to work out, it's not okay when they aren't doing anything about the issues except taking them out on another person. That's when you need to reconsider healthy boundaries.", "NTA - Your friend sounds salty as fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck, and merely *having* a relationship doesn't mean you're *flaunting* it. Actually, I'd wager that at some level (probably subconsciously) your friend probably considers the two of you to be in a form of emotional relationship, and she's feeling massively threatened that your new boo is invading \"her\" turf.", "A slight AH", "Sounds like your BFF has serious feelings for and is jealous of your BF.", "NTA. I'd say she's more threatened that her one true friend is being pulled away. Your life is moving forward and she isn't.  Happens a lot. Resentment and jealousy aren't pretty from ppl you love.", "NTA - I think you are on the right track when you realized she is jealous. It sounds like she has more than friendship feelings for you. She may have even thought you were in a relationship with her or liked to pretend you are. Be careful and watch your back.", "Nta. She is jealous. You pay rent, you get rights. She will have to get over it....and maybe get some therapy.", "NTA. But reading this, it does sound like your roommate is jealous. The only question is if she\u2019s jealous of you for having a bf, or jealous of him cuz he\u2019s with you.", "NTA she sounds like me when I was a teenager and my best friend, who I was madly in love with, started dating. She might have feelings for you and not even realize it herself.", "Miss ma\u2019am\u2026 Your roommate is in love with you.", "NTA, OP. Your friend is very jealous and possessive. Unfortunately, you live together so going to his place might be better instead of him coming to yours. Keep going with this relationship as long as he is awesome and treats you right. In the future, you may move out of your current apartment and in with your BF. Until that happens, I would try to keep the peace in your home. Keep your bestie at arms length regarding your bf (don't talk about him, if you have plans with him, stay vague with your bestie). I'm hopeful this works out for you.", "NTA - but\u2026she isn\u2019t your friend anymore, for better or worse. And at the very least, start looking into alternate living arrangements in case things really go south fast.", "NTA.  Is the roomie in love with you?", "I definitely think I\u2019ve overlooked her selfish behaviour and this whole situation has sort of opened the windows so I can see it. Even just talking to my partner about different scenarios with her (cleaning up after her, buying all the furniture, covering groceries and rent when she can\u2019t afford it, her getting mad when I book jobs that she doesn\u2019t, etc.) I\u2019ve started to realize that maybe things aren\u2019t normal????? He literally stared at me with a crazy look for a good 30 seconds when I told him I do her dishes every night \ud83e\udd72", "I really think she\u2019s just jealous. Surely most people here can relate to that phase of a breakup where you kinda hate everyone in happy relationships and eventually you get over it. Well, sounds like she\u2019s stuck in that stage but not because of a breakup, just because of lack of experience.\n\nIm not saying she\u2019s right but it seems like people here are reaching for more complicated explanations for no reason. She needs to get over it, but have you considered just being blunt in a kind way about this possibility? I have a friend who was very considerate about bringing her bf around while her roommate was in an LDR just to be kinder to her. \n\nAgain, not doing it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. But you\u2019ve been friends for a long time and this is probably something she\u2019s embarrassed to admit to you.", "I wish you every success on that score. Be strong! You don't deserve mistreatment for your happiness.", "Yes loads! I\u2019ve had my male best friend stay on our couch loads of times and she and him get along so well that we\u2019ve all become friends! Andy sister stays over and so does hers. Our place used to be a bit of an air bnb for friends before the pandemic lol", "She could be. She\u2019s definitely one of those people who isn\u2019t proactive in like helping herself. If she gets a headache she won\u2019t take Tylenol just complain, she has shoulder problems but won\u2019t see a doctor (it\u2019s free where we live), tight on money but won\u2019t stop buying clothes, etc. so getting any sort of neurodivergent assessment/help will be a 0% chance, and being on the spectrum myself I\u2019m not sure how to handle or manage or help in this situation. I\u2019ve reassured her that she\u2019s not losing me but it\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t care to believe me.", "Yes!!! This is exactly it!!! She says things like \u201cwell you have a boyfriend ask him\u201d if I ask her simple things, or if I ask if she wants to go to the movies she asks if he was unavailable!", "Thank you!!! We love trauma responses!!!", "Matches!! She\u2019ll match with guys on apps and talk to them for a week or so and then when they suggest going out for drinks or coffee she just stops talking to them", "That's very weird. It could honestly be anything that causes her to act like that.\n\nMaybe she feels like you'll abandon her for your relationship. Have you ever changed your attitude or would ditch her during your past relationships? \n\nMaybe she's jealous that you found someone and she's still single\n\nMaybe she has romantic feelings for you and doesn't like seeing you with your bf\n\nMaybe she only likes you when you're not dating someone\n\nMaybe she's dealing with other stuff and taking it out on you", "Super annoying, right?! We didn't do anything wrong by getting an SO, but they make up some scenario in their heads that they are being fully replaced. \n\nI realized that the friend I was referring to fed off of her own mindset that I was some sort of fuck up, and got satisfaction when I needed advice as a friend.  Like,  I would tell her something simple about work that frustrated me, and she would judge me and give me shit. I was belittled so much for no reason, other than her trying to make herself sound smarter and a bigger person.  \n\nIt's a whole thing lol", "I\u2019m the primary leaseholder in the apartment and she\u2019s on a roommate agreement so there\u2019s definitely no overnight guest rules lol", "Hahaha, my stupid phone. Thanks for the laugh. I fixed it.", "Link?", "I\u2019m starting to wonder that too, honestly! She always complains about being single but I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s doing it compulsory or if there\u2019s something else going on. I have always been open about my sexuality (just cause I\u2019ve been single forever doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a recluse) and she\u2019s never had an issue with me talking about it until it was someone a little more permanent and stable coming into my life.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10o8rjj/aita_for_throwing_my_friend_out_of_my_birthday/j6d3nfq/", "NTA. Sounds like you\u2019re friend is struggling with the changing of the dynamics of your relationship. She might just have become accustomed to both of you being single and may be a bit too emotionally reliant on you. Could also be envy, of course. Talk to her calmly, ask her to tell you why she\u2019s uncomfortable about your having a boyfriend now and why she doesn\u2019t want to meet him. Clearly this is someone who\u2019s becoming important to you so you want your friend to meet him. Don\u2019t pressure her but also make it clear that she has to get used to his being in your life (and consequently and inevitably in hers if she wants to stay friends).", "NTA\nShe has an unhealthy attachment to you and doesn\u2019t want to share.", "Your friendship may be over. Good luck. NTA.", "Kinda tough position to be in. Sorry OP. I used to be in the roommate\u2019s position. Me and (ex) bestie went through a similar situation with me being perpetually single and angry at her and her gf for simply being together. \n\nI\u2019m ashamed and willing to admit that I was possessive and jealous. Def don\u2019t think I was in love, but for sure had a grand \u201cbesties against the world\u201d narrative in my head. We were super codependent, looking at it in retrospect. \n\nIn the end, I wish my friend had been honest and pointed out my behavior (nicely). We had a lot of conversations where I vented my feelings, but I never got to hear what she thought/what I needed to hear. \n\nI think your only wrong here, OP, was the moment you snapped at roomie could have been used as an opportunity to gently point out that it feels like she\u2019s mad at you for being in a relationship and ask her why. \n\nYa live and learn. There\u2019s def still time for a conversation.\n\nEDIT: NTA", "How old is she?????   You hit the nail on the head, she is jealous that you have a life and relationship outside her.  Ignore her and live your best Iife.   Unfortunately, you will not be able to bring him to your place, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem.", "NTA\n\nI think you need to sit her down and, without anger, try to have a very calm conversation about what is bothering her. Like the other commenters said I have a hunch she has feelings for you but I don\u2019t know for certain. Then update us because I am INVESTED.", "NTA\n\nlol reminds me of that one post where OP and her friend were both overweight, then when OP's friend lost weight and got on a diet and stuff, OP had a tantrum because obviously her friend was just losing weight to make fun of her.\n\nbut seriously OP, she needs to get a life outside of you.\n\nif she feels that you are flaunting your relationship, then she needs to do something about it herself like getting a boyfriend/girlfriend, not take it out on you.", "NTA she sounds jealous", "Came here to say this!!! Absolutely in love\u2026", "Now that you have clarified... I believe your roommate is jealous and you probably will need to move all of that house if you want to spend time with this man", "She wants her to stay single with her. Friends can be possessive, too. She'd have the same reaction if OP had a new friend. She thinks of OP as \"hers\" and that she should always come first. NTA. She needs to get a life of her own.", "My first thought was jealousy.", "All of the above.", "I totally understand this comment and get it to a point. \n\nBut any friend that feels those ways needs to communicate it. And if they already feel a certain way, they are going to stick to it no matter what you say or what actions you take to make them feel included. It's very hard to have friends like this, NGL. \n\nWe can only do so much, and it is exhausting when they do not open up when you ask and they do not say anything back. We cannot be their clutches just because they feel that way. We have lives too."]}
