You should probably figure that out.", "And she's 25 years old??? Nah she is either in love with you or just rediculously childish.

I got this way when my friend got a girlfriend and wanted to talk about her all the time. Two, if she knows your partner (maybe she won\u2019t admit it, but knows him from somewhere else) she has feelings for him? She is turning down dates, which seems strange. This may lead to my third suspicion, which is that she is in a poor mental state. Check in on her, I think that may help with all three of these possibilities. \n\n\nThis seems really strange and if you\u2019re not bringing someone else into her space, I really don\u2019t see a reason to be upset with you. \n\nNAH.", "NTA.

The problem here is because you have known each other since you were 11 and probably have been single for a while if you haven't dated anyone since high school, means your entire friendship both of you have been single. I went through this where my friend had a boyfriend then when I got a boyfriend and she became single she became fuming to the point where I couldn't even talk about him. At the time I didn't understand why she couldn't be happy for me, but at the same time, you never know the hurt that they feel because of how lonely they truly are. It is not fair for her to unload all of her dirty laundry on you. Although as a friend, I think you really need to evaluate why she's upset over this situation.

She feels like she is losing the only person she has. I bet seeing you break out of 7 years of  singleness and leaving her behind upsets her but that\u2019s her problem to deal with. \n\nShe might actually like you as well. Nothing you can do about that either if you are not interested in her in that way.\n\nChat with her, tell her how excited you are about the new relationship and how perhaps sometimes the three of you can do things together.  \n\nWork out, what it looks like to have guests in your apartment. She cannot be the sole person to say guests can come over or stay.", "NTA. This is super common among friends who grow older, often when one of two less-social people becomes more social, but it can happen in a variety of circumstances. When one person starts to get in shape, or starts dating, or starts succeeding at a shared dream career, it causes a lot of emotion in the person who thought you both were 'in the same boat.' Clearly, she wishes she were in a relationship, but has some sort of block on getting into one. Not dating between high school and 26 is pretty atypical, to say the least.\n\nShe's going to need to get used to it because it's unreasonable for your boyfriend not to have seen your apartment. Hopefully she gets past it, and you'll need to have a talk with her, but this might just be a rift in your friendship. People just become different, and mid-20s is often when that's most visible. I mean, when you meet people at 11, you're nowhere near the same people you'll be at 25 or 35.\n\nAlso, I'm guessing Reddit is going to assume she's in love with you because they correctly guessed that a woman's husband was gay and in love with his best friend *one time*, but I don't really see anything here to jump to that conclusion.", "NTA but maybe she\u2019s actually in love with you? That\u2019s still not your problem but could explain her ridiculous behavior.", "NTA.

That's a HER problem. \n\nTho you may be aggravatig the problem too. She said youre flaunting your relationship in front of her. How exactly? Maybe you just keep on talking about your boyfriend all the time. Every oncr in a while is fine but even I would get annoyed if my friends keep on making their boyfriend and being on a relationship a personality. Don't tell her your plans if she isnt asking. Stay with topics you both enjoy\n\nIf you arent excessively talking about your boyfriend and your relationship, then youre fine. Don't force her to meet your boyfriend either, that's just gonna end badly. If she doesnt have a lot of friends, she may be jealous not just because you have a boyfriend but also because she feels like she's taking the backseat and she doesnt like that. Make sure that you still do lots of fun things with her. Mingling your friend and boyfriend can come later.", "NTA.  And time to move out.", "Jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius.", "INFO is this behavior out of character for her? Or have you simply overlooked her selfish behavior over the years?\n\nIf this is new for her, then you can be understanding, caring, and patient, letting her know that you love her, and that you can both work it out slowly over time at her pace. That for your part, you will try to ignore her snarky behavior, and will instead continue to offer solutions to her uncomfortable feelings of loneliness.\n\nBut if you have overlooked her selfish behavior over the years, and just now find it to be offensive, you can be less patient and more straight forward, offering her an opportunity to move forward with you as a friend, or, offer her the chance to begin her new lifestyle without you being as close as you are now.\n\nEither way, make it clear you will be dating your boyfriend, having fun, and enjoying time with him.", "NTA....it sounds like the two of you have been happily single together....now that you are getting serious about this guy it's going to change the dynamic of your relationship and she is going to be left behind.

He\u2019s from out of town about an hour and 45 mins away and has no connection to either of the industries my roommate and work in, so there\u2019s like a 0.0001% chance she knows him at all.

I pay more in rent, cover all the utilities, bought all the furniture that\u2019s in our shared space, and all our kitchen appliances because she couldn\u2019t afford it when she moved in and I could so for all intents and purposes a majority of the apartment/things in it mostly mine!

I\u2019ve tried to bring it up with her before, reassures her that she isn\u2019t losing me, but she never wants to talk about it.

She gets matches all the time and gets asked out, but she never goes! I\u2019ve even offered to be in disguise and a few tables over to make sure she\u2019s comfortable but she just shrugs it off and ghosts them. \n\nI rarely bring him up, if I\u2019m honest, because I know the reaction I get from her when I do. I also only tend to see him once a week or so as he lives a bit away and we both work full time. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m out with him every night. 6/7 days of the week (sometimes 5 if I go to his) is spent with her. \n\nI was on the phone to my sister the other day in my room and was talking about the show him and I are going to this week and I came out of my room to find her completely ignoring me when I started talking to her about something else.

I agree that I shouldn\u2019t have snapped at her, but I don\u2019t see how this makes me a *huge* ass hole.

If she doesn't want to be friendly with him, she doesn't have to. But she doesn't get to dictate your life either. She can stay in her room or go out when he's there if she really must. Or she could move out and take her crappy attitude elsewhere. \n\nShe doesn't get to decide who you get to spend time with, and or who you let in your house - it's perfectly normal to have your partner over. It's not like you're inviting a random stranger to live with you. If she's so uncomfortable having other people around she's going to have to go and live by herself.

Move out so that you can live without worrying about the reactions of someone you have no control over, and who's stifling your ability to live the life you want to live.", "Well then, she absolutely needs some counseling. You can suggest it, but can't make her do it. However, you are entitled to bring over your boyfriend whenever you want, besides just to meet her because you wanted to share this good thing in your life with her, and need to tell her, in a calm but matter of fact way that you aren't limiting your life to suit her personal emotional issues.", "Those are reasonable wants.", "That is bizarre but it also kinda points out to something more than being jealous that youre in a relationship. It can be something like what the other people said, that she likes you but it can also be sometning else. How's the friendship dynamic before your boyfriend was in the future? I know of some people who can't be happy of their friends' achievements in general because they're just jealous of the person in general, an inferiority complex or the opposite and they were surprised and mad because between the two of you, youre the first one who got a boyfriend and that didnt sit well with them since they think theyre better.\n\nThat's toxic. Have you tried asking her if she has any other problems with you? If you ask her point blank and she wouldnt tell you or just get mad, i honestly just would have left it at that.  Stop concerning yourself about her. If she ignores you, ignore her back. Two can play that game. It might give her something to think about. I also have friends I am friends with for more than a decade and I'd rather compromise than get into an argument, but it does happen sometimes. Sometimes it's for the better and a few weeks apart (metaphorically, in your case since you live together) can do good or sometimes it just breaks.\n\nAlso, stop caring about her relationship. If she starts complaining about it, the petty on me suggests to roll your eyes at her too. See how she likes that. The disguise thing is funny tho, if a friend offered me that i would totally go out on a date with a random just to see that.", "To elaborate I meant that if you noticed her attitude towards your romantic activities ( not agreeing with her pov but acknowledging it) it just seems very unwise to get her involved at all despite how you feel about her opinion.

We are both theatre performers and trying to do it professionally while working our big girl jobs!

I don't know your friend, but there are friendship dynamics out there where youre not in the same page, and aren't equal. I don't wanna bad mouth a girl I dont know but if she is the type that can be narcissistic or at the very least feels superior to you, you might want to start looking for other friends. I won't say ditch her unless the relationship isnt salvageable anymore, but I think that may take a turn for the worse before it gets better, if it gets better. Your friend is starting to realize that being pretty and talented isnt enough anymore and things arent just going to fall on her lap. \n\nTo me that explains her relationship dilemma too, seems to me like she wants someone to take care of her, hence a relationship but she doesnt want to make a move and thinks people would just naturally gravitate towards her. Her attitude probably leaves a lot to be desired too if she can't even be happy youre getting jobs. She can be a little bit jealous about it, but annoyed? I don't even want to be in her space if shes going to be like that", "ESH. You suck for not considering your friends dislike with relationship and forcing her to meet him. She sucks for not letting you have your bf over in your own apartment. \n\nAlso, maybe she likes you. Really weird. You should probably move out and reevaluate your friends since I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to be in a relationship in the future and this will keep happening. If so then in the future YTA since you know what it is and you keep putting yourself in this situation.", "Nta. Spoiler alert. She's always been in love with you", "NTA. You said it yourself, you shouldn't live with friends. It's because it works...until it doesn't.\n\nYour friend is jealous. Maybe of the fact that you have a boyfriend. Maybe of the fact you have less time for her. Maybe of your boyfriend, period. It's not your fault that she can't cope with this change. \n\nMaybe it's time to start planning. Doesn't have to be immediately, but what will you do if your living conditions continue to deteriorate or if she tries to sabotage your relationship? What if she tries to perma-ban him from your home? If you're leasing, plan on what you're going to do when your lease is up, you're moving on to a different phase of life and living together isn't healthy for either of you any more.", "NTA\n\nHonestly I dont think this is strange either\n\nYou've been a big part of each other's lives for a while. It is natural to have some resentment towards that ending, especially if you aren't the one changing the status quo\n\nDoesn't make her responses okay, but they are understandable", "You\u2019re definitely NTA. However, I don\u2019t necessarily think that your roommate is in love with you like some of the other commenters. Yes, she might be jealous because your boyfriend is a threat to your friendship and what she\u2019s known. But the fact that she\u2019s on apps and declines or ghosts makes me believe that there is more going on that she might not even know how to express. It might help her to talk to someone about this and even if it\u2019s just about the new dynamic. My hunch is that your roomie is either asexual and doesn\u2019t know it or possibly has ADHD and doesn\u2019t know it. Rejection sensitivity is a symptom of ADHD in women and you\u2019re in a form rejecting her. And society has strong expectations about single women and dating (and getting married) so she may be on apps because she feels like she has to not because she wants to. Maybe her behavior all boils down to her having a crush on you but I wouldn\u2019t dismiss that there are some other explanations here as well. Either way, you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. Your friend is an unwanted loner.", "It sounds like she is just incredibly jealous that you have a partner and she doesn\u2019t. Probably because she can\u2019t find one and you finally did after so long. \n\nI think the best way to approach this if you value her friendship is to tell her that you love her and want her support in this relationship and you know that she loves you back so you really want to understand how to make this work.", "NTA \n\nBut \u201csingle white female\u201d \n\nPut that movie on!!!!", "At the very least, in love with controlling you.", "Then what is her reasoning for why she's being so unsupportive about it?", "Yes, she might not be in love, but she's certainly possessive for some reason.", "Yep, my brain supplied the phrase queer platonic life partners, and maybe this is Roomie thinking that meant monogamous", "Ok then make her move out if she's so uncomfortable with the idea of you having a boyfriend and she can't keep it to herself.", "Already guessing NTA on that one", "Or maybe she's insecure and awkward or is scared to get hurt."]}
