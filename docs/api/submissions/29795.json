This post mostly concerns our daughters. One of our daughters, Ava, is our biological child. We are adopting Emma. \n\nEmma and Ava were in the same preschool. The girls were best friends and Emma's bio mom was a single mom so we helped a lot with babysitting, drop offs, and pickups. When the girls were in kindergarten Emma's bio mom started dating a guy with 3 kids and he wasn't interested in raising another man's child. Emma started staying with us for days at a time that year. Over the next 2 years, her mom married the man and had 2 more kids with him. Emma was with us so often that we converted one of the guest rooms to a bedroom for her. Then when the girls were in 2nd grade, Emma's bio mom, stepdad, and step/half siblings packed up and moved while Emma was on vacation with us. \n\nHer bio mom reached out to us and said that she and her family needed a fresh start and that if we don't want Emma, she could try to find a family member to take her. My wife and I decided we wanted to keep her and she will be officially adopted in a couple months. Emma is such a sweet little girl. She's so well behaved, she does great in school, she's never had a problem making friends, and she always runs to hug me the second I come home from work. She does have a lot of anxiety and abandonment issues, though, and my family hasn't accepted her. \n\nMy niece's (6) birthday was 2 weeks ago and Emma's was last week. My niece had a small party in her backyard, we dropped by for an hour, brought her a dress and lego set, and left. For Emma's birthday we had a pretty extravagant party at the park. There was a bounce house, princess, face painter, and crafts set up on the tables. We had over 20 kids plus my wife's family come and it was great. My family stopped by the house to say happy birthday and drop off a couple gifts, then Emma started to open her gifts. Her 2 big ones from us were a phone and a kids moped thing (it's perfectly safe, easy to balance on, and has a max speed of 8mph). She also got a couple small toys and some clothes from us. When my family saw this, they started asking why I was able to do all of this for Emma but could only managed to get my niece a cheap lego set. I told them Emma's my daughter and they said she wasn't and that my niece is family so she should've taken priority. I kicked them out of the house but Emma's birthday was already ruined. I've been getting messages berating me for favoring a \"stranger\" over my family.

Emma is not a stranger, she is your daughter. Your family's stance is ridiculous and fully in the AH camp. I mean, who gets their niece better gifts than their own children? Your family needs to learn that the love for adopted children is no different than biological children.", "NTA. Quite disrespectful of all of them. Do they have a special bloodline or something? Are they Targaryens? I don't even know why you're asking this question. She's your daughter.", "NTA. Woah woah woah, you have to tell your family to slow their roll. Emma is **not** and has **never been** a stranger. Emma started out as Ava's best friend, and is becoming your daughter due to the (traumatic) abandonment of her bio family. Emma has way more need to feel loved, celebrated and special after her experiences and deserves it, too, because **she's your daughter and you love her**. How *dare* your family invalidate her existence and importance, especially in FRONT of her (sickening), and greedily claim your niece deserves better than her. Nope.", "NTA.  Lego is not cheap.", "NTA and it is time to set boundaries with your family over how they speak to and about your daughter. She's been a part of your family for years, and she IS family. And the beautiful thing about family is that you get to CREATE your own family when you're an adult. \n\nIf they can't accept all of your family, they're not invited to be around anymore.", "NTA but your family sure is, gj having your daughter's back. They can buy an iPhone for their 6 y/o if they want.", "Emma is your daughter and is family. You decide who is and isn't family. I'd be tempted to \"unfamily\" anyone with a problem with that.\n\nNTA", "NTA why do people suck so much? She's a child a small innocent person who just wants love and has already been through her own mom chucking her like garbage. You're a good dad and your wife is a good mom and you're good people. \n\n\"I won't be family to people who think a child deserves hate for existing.\"", "NTA. Your gifts to your daughter and niece were both apppropriate.\n\nAs you said, your family hasn't accepted Emma as your daughter. I would keep them away from her as much as possible. She has been through enough.", "NTA. If you see her as your daughter then she is your daughter. Great guy right here", "NTA\n\nMost people put more effort into their own children's events than those of other children. You acted like most parents. Besides, a Lego set is a cool gift for most kids, so it isn't like you gifted your niece a pair of socks or something disappointing like that.", "NTA uh of course you are going to throw a big birthday party for your adopted daughter who was literally abandoned by her mom while on vacation?", "NTA. \n\nEmma is your daughter, blood or no blood. You chose to bring her into your family and love and accept her like she was biologically yours. \n\nA niece is a niece and it is her parent\u2019s responsibility to purchase the extravagant type of presents if they so wish. You\u2019re not obligated to get her anything at all. \n\nYou did your part. But if they want to play silly beggars they can have a much smaller role in your lives, especially if they view Emma the way they stated.", "The world needs more people like you. NTA", "Nta.

Protect your sweet little children - all of them.", "As an adoptee, thank you for standing up for her.

A piece of paper will soon state that, but it sounds like she has been your daughter for quite some time.\n\nBiology does not make a family.  \n\nAs for your niece, sounds like you gave her VERY nice gifts.  Your sister needs a time out from your kids.", "I'm so glad Emma has someone like you. I can't imagine saying a child who's been abandoned by their bio \"family\" doesn't deserve presents from the family that's about to adopt them ON THEIR BIRTHDAY. Absolutely VILE AND DISGUSTING behaviour. If I was in your position I would choose Emma over them every single time.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Emma needed you and you stepped up - good for you!  Your family of origin needs to accept that Emma is your actual daughter now that you're adopting her.  If they refuse to treat Emma the same as your other children, you'll need to reduce contact with them.  I would immediately block them from contact with all your children until they apologize to you.", "NTA Emma is your daughter and she deserves everything!

Emma is so lucky to have you and your family in her life.", "Nta ,and you are a good dad. One concern though - probably if Emma is very well behaved, it means that she is fearing that if she is not on her best behaviour, then maybe you will not treat her the same way you do now. It happens a lot with kids with abandonment issues . And well, Emma lost her bio mom , had her entire family move up, and probably will never see them again. She had a rough childhood. She deserves every part of that extravagant party.", "NTA and what cruel, greedy, selfish people your family are! You've been Emma's parents for as long as your niece has been aware of your existence and nothing about a lego set is cheap or inappropriatefor a 6 year old. Emma is your child. Of course you go big for your kid! I am so sorry that Emma had to hear more adults say she isn't worthy of love and attention and I hope she saw you stick up for her immediately. I hope you never allow l any of them to be alone with any of your kids again, because they will absolutely spout this bullshit as they get older, and so will the kids they train to resent her. Anyone who said or texted anything against your family of 6 should be removed from all of your lives. That poor kid.", "NTA! First of all how can a so called mom abandon her child for a man .
