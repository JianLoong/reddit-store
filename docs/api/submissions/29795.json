This post mostly concerns our daughters. One of our daughters, Ava, is our biological child. We are adopting Emma. \n\nEmma and Ava were in the same preschool. The girls were best friends and Emma's bio mom was a single mom so we helped a lot with babysitting, drop offs, and pickups. When the girls were in kindergarten Emma's bio mom started dating a guy with 3 kids and he wasn't interested in raising another man's child. Emma started staying with us for days at a time that year. Over the next 2 years, her mom married the man and had 2 more kids with him. Emma was with us so often that we converted one of the guest rooms to a bedroom for her. Then when the girls were in 2nd grade, Emma's bio mom, stepdad, and step/half siblings packed up and moved while Emma was on vacation with us. \n\nHer bio mom reached out to us and said that she and her family needed a fresh start and that if we don't want Emma, she could try to find a family member to take her. My wife and I decided we wanted to keep her and she will be officially adopted in a couple months. Emma is such a sweet little girl. She's so well behaved, she does great in school, she's never had a problem making friends, and she always runs to hug me the second I come home from work. She does have a lot of anxiety and abandonment issues, though, and my family hasn't accepted her. \n\nMy niece's (6) birthday was 2 weeks ago and Emma's was last week. My niece had a small party in her backyard, we dropped by for an hour, brought her a dress and lego set, and left. For Emma's birthday we had a pretty extravagant party at the park. There was a bounce house, princess, face painter, and crafts set up on the tables. We had over 20 kids plus my wife's family come and it was great. My family stopped by the house to say happy birthday and drop off a couple gifts, then Emma started to open her gifts. Her 2 big ones from us were a phone and a kids moped thing (it's perfectly safe, easy to balance on, and has a max speed of 8mph). She also got a couple small toys and some clothes from us. When my family saw this, they started asking why I was able to do all of this for Emma but could only managed to get my niece a cheap lego set. I told them Emma's my daughter and they said she wasn't and that my niece is family so she should've taken priority. I kicked them out of the house but Emma's birthday was already ruined. I've been getting messages berating me for favoring a \"stranger\" over my family.

Are they Targaryens? I don't even know why you're asking this question. She's your daughter.", "NTA. Woah woah woah, you have to tell your family to slow their roll. Emma is **not** and has **never been** a stranger. Emma started out as Ava's best friend, and is becoming your daughter due to the (traumatic) abandonment of her bio family. Emma has way more need to feel loved, celebrated and special after her experiences and deserves it, too, because **she's your daughter and you love her**.

Emma is so lucky to have you and your family in her life.", "Nta ,and you are a good dad. One concern though - probably if Emma is very well behaved, it means that she is fearing that if she is not on her best behaviour, then maybe you will not treat her the same way you do now. It happens a lot with kids with abandonment issues . And well, Emma lost her bio mom , had her entire family move up, and probably will never see them again. She had a rough childhood. She deserves every part of that extravagant party.", "NTA and what cruel, greedy, selfish people your family are! You've been Emma's parents for as long as your niece has been aware of your existence and nothing about a lego set is cheap or inappropriatefor a 6 year old. Emma is your child. Of course you go big for your kid! I am so sorry that Emma had to hear more adults say she isn't worthy of love and attention and I hope she saw you stick up for her immediately. I hope you never allow l any of them to be alone with any of your kids again, because they will absolutely spout this bullshit as they get older, and so will the kids they train to resent her. Anyone who said or texted anything against your family of 6 should be removed from all of your lives. That poor kid.", "NTA! First of all how can a so called mom abandon her child for a man .  Emma is as much your daughter as Ava . The only Major AH\u2019s are Emma\u2019s bio mom, her mom\u2019s husband, and your family . Once again you are NTA!", "NTA.

Your family is awful.", "NTA- now I'm not a parent, so I might be getting this wrong, but you and your wife have raised a daughter and two sons who are content to share their home and their family with this little girl, and your family are saying a dress AND a lego set are not enough presents for a 6 YO. So when it comes to what is the appropriate way to treat a child, surely we default to listening to the person who has raised three children with innate generosity of spirit to a level that's kinda making me tear up here?", "Why you should even pose the question of am I the AH is beyond my ability to understand.  Emma IS your daughter. Your family being related to you is doubtful. Lol. You sound like such an awesome person that I wonder how you could be related to AHs like them. Wish Emma a happy birthday! As for the other blood relatives, well, ignore them. They aren't worth your efforts. Good luck!", "This is absolutely a hill to die on. Emma IS your daughter, you've been her parent for YEARS now. She's also been thrown away and abandoned by her bio family. What kind of person would look at any of this and think 'wah it's not fair Emma got a better party than niece!'.\n\nShe's your daughter, and frankly if they cannot accept that then they don't have any right to a relationship with any of you.

If they can't accept that, then they need to not come around and not be a part of your life.

Emma is about to legally be your daughter, and you are right to treat her as your daughter now.", "Hell No!!  Kick them to the curb. \n\nYour extended family are so incredibly greedy and entitled. They also add no value to your family's life,  do they?  But they really are trying to tear you apart...\n\nEmma had been abandoned, tosses out like trash because she's not blood related to her selfish bio-mom's husband. \n\nDid they even pack and drop off Emma's things or did everything get tossed into the trash as they moved out like thieves in the dead of night? \n\nThat little girl needed to feel special. Needed to know somebody loves her and was willing to spend that much to make her day special.  Obviously you can't do that every year,  but this year she needed that reassurance. And you gave it to her. \n\nYour family have just proven they are heartless and will NEVER accept her as your child. There will always be emotional abusive towards Emma.\n\nParents always give \"better\" gifts to their own children. That's how it should be. \n\nYour family also just told you,  whether you realize it or not,  that your daughter Emma will receive a gift they'd give to a stranger. That future disparity between your children will build hurt and resentment.  As a parent its your job to circumvent that, to keep your family (you,  wife, and 4 kids) whole, strong, and loving towards each other and standing up for each other. \n\nRemind everyone texting that you are in the process of adopting Emma. That she was your child from the moment she needed you and you love her. Anyone who can't accept that, are no family to you. \n\nHoping you have put Emma into therapy. Guessing you have. Keep an eye on the other kids too since adjustment can sometimes be rough. \n\nGoing forward keep an eye out that you don't over compensate for Emma's abandonment and let her get away with things you wouldn't allow the other kids.  If she's family,  the other kids will expect her to be treated the same as themselves. Its very easy to slip into trying to make up for her loss and spoiling her compared to the others. \n\nYou did a good job making this birthday special for Emma. I think your other children understand why this birthday party you gave was important to do and make it a big deal. \n\nDon't give your extended family the power to ruin it for you and your family. You have photos of the party, let the kids pick their favorite.  Then go to Walmart, have the kids pick their frame, and then printed out the correct size for each frame.  Then hang / stand it up wherever they want to - bedroom, living room,  etc \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nAlso in which world is a lego set cheap??", "NTA Emma is your daughter and you are not required to spend as much on your niece as your own kids.", "NTA Emma is your daughter and Legos are not cheap", "I was thinking the same!", "Probably because OP's extended family are trying to brainwash him into thinking Emma isn't his by blood, so she's not family. \n\nBasically doing the exact same thing Emma's bio-mother and new stepdad said - not blood related to stepdad so toss her out, she's not family.", "The family is vile regardless. Even if Emma was their biological child, who expects someone to spend MORE on a niece/nephew than on their own child? Did the family expect a bouncy house blowout party for the 6YO niece paid for by OP? I guess they did...", "She's slowly improving and starting to feel safe with us but I don't think her fears and anxiety will ever completely go away.", "Abandoning her is the best thing she's done. Emma was treated horribly there. We did everything we could to keep her away from them.", "We're lucky to have her.

Yes the kids are definitely family to each other and you guys.\n\nYour extended family are jerks.", "How are you able to legally adopt Emma then? Won't her mother's rights need to be terminated?", "Unless the bio mum agreed to sign over her rights? I\u2019m not American so not 100% sure how it works there tbh.", "I don't think you can just sign over your rights. There would have been an investigation and evidence of neglect to terminate the rights.", "Quick google search says in USA, you can sign over your parental rights voluntarily if it\u2019s in the best interest of the child and no investigation will take place.\n\nInvestigation is only done when it\u2019s involuntary.", "I know someone who couldn't care for their newborn, so signed her rights over for a friend to adopt her baby. She wanted to make sure her baby was in good hands and not in the system.\n\nI don't know all the details, basically they had to prove they had a jobn room for the baby, and could care for the child.  It was a fairly quick process. \n\nI don't know if all US states handle it the same way."]}
