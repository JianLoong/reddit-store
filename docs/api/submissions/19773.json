Most people wouldn't assume that someone is uncomfortable with opening the gift in front of someone. That's definitely abnormal and would need to be clearly explained.

I guess could make someone upset but I don't see how - or she could have made it a whole cringey affair so that also would change the situation) \n\nThere's some info left out of this story. I don't think it's fair to assume he's told her these specific things as he's laid out to us here. I have specific hang ups like that, and I've made the mistake of telling my husband I don't like something in a vague way, assuming he would understand all of my thoughts behind it. When we sat and talked, I laid it out with a lot more context. My husband changed from that point on. He might have needed reminders, but he made an effort. But working with the little information I gave him, there was no way for him to properly understand my boundaries.

I'm a gift person - I love thinking of special things to give family and friends for birthdays and special occasions and I'm (generally) very good at it. I had one long-term boyfriend who disliked every gift I gave him. He'd literally unwrap gifts, say 'oh great, thanks, but I don't need this' and next I'd see it in the spare room cupboard, and eventually he'd regift it. It was humiliating because I put a lot of thought into every gift. \n\nWe talked a lot about love languages and that I understood his wasn't gifts (his was physical touch/acts of service) but it wasn't like I could do 'more' of either of those for his birthday since we were *very* physically connected and I did a lot around (his) house - he said he just didn't want anything new in the house, and if he did ever want something he'd rather buy it himself, because he didn't want 'my stuff' in his house. I could give him money or buy groceries (which I did all the time anyway when I was staying at his place) but he didn't want 'things.'\n\nNot long after that conversation, his beloved dog passed away after I'd sat with him for the last six months (I had a WFH job) and he was devastated. We came home from the vet and he completely removed every trace that the dog had ever existed within hours... took everything to the dump, cleaned the house top to bottom, even rearranged the furniture so nothing reminded him of the dog. Then I understood something deeper about him and 'things' and why he didn't want any 'thing' tied to me... if he'd mentally erased his dog of 14 years, it would be even easier for him to erase his girlfriend of four years, and his dislike of gifts was really about 'I don't want any reminders of you when we inevitably break up.' \n\nAbout a year later we did break up, or rather he suddenly dumped me, and on my way out (I'd been staying at his house for the long weekend, and he gave me time to pack my things, because after five years you have your spot in the bathroom cupboard and a couple drawers in the bedroom and a phone charger in the spare room and... you get the picture) we had one last big hug, he said 'I'm sorry, I just think it's the right time to call it,' and I was taking it all pretty darn well, considering... then he said 'oh, you should take \\[a fairly recent present I'd given him\\], maybe someone you know would like it,' and I basically collapsed. It was so, so humiliating and hurtful. He realised it straight away and apologised, but I was crying wildly for *weeks*. It's been years and it still makes me cry thinking about it! \n\nWe had a short period of NC but we're now really good friends. I love the guy. He's said trying to give me that gift back is the cruellest thing he's ever done to another human and one of very few regrets he has in how he's handled his life (he's generally a good dude!) \n\nOP, your fianc\u00e9 and the mother of your child is trying to do nice things for you because she loves you, not because she's trying to hurt you. She's *understandably* confused and probably feels very insecure when you accept gifts and time from others but not her. You need to communicate about this, because presumably, you do want this relationship to continue... part of that is saying 'gifts and seduction attempts and making a big deal of my birthday aren't fun for me,' and part of that is talking about things she can do (or already does) that you will appreciate, because you appreciate her.\n\nBTW, why was 'trying to seduce you' off-putting because it's your birthday?", "Lol emotional labor.", "NAH because I completely understand her perspective but it's your birthday so your wishes take precedence.\n\nBut I gotta ask...if you're not comfortable opening gifts in front of someone you're (potentially) setting up to spend the rest of your life with...and they try to seduce you and you're not interested...are you sure this is the person you want to have around on the rest of your birthdays?

Basically, she wants attention.\n\n>This time, it was even more so because after the gift giving routine she tried to seduce me and initiate some weird roleplay thing.\n\nOh god, birthday sex. Like, I get some guys are into that, but the expectation that guys should want and be happy with that(especially in some cases as a replacement for an actual gift) is sexism.\n\n>She said I humiliated her by telling her this when I did \n\nLet the jury note, she's basically shaming the OP for telling her he's not down for sex.
