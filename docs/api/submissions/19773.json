I don't agree with those comments.\n\n'There's no expectations there, just trust' ??!!\n\nIf you don't want expectation than maybe shouldn't have gotten married and have a kid.

You can be grateful for the gift in front of her (and if not go to therapy). You can say you don't feel like doing role play sex but prefer family time without going into a mental shut down.
