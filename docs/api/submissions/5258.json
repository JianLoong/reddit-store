It was kind of sudden, baby dropped at the fire station sort of situation. I had known they were in the process of adopting, but as far as I knew they were kind of early on. I don\u2019t know anything about the process so I guess I thought a pregnant woman looked through stacks of applicants, picked some family, met with them, and they went to the hospital to get the baby when it was born. Basically I thought there would be a lot of lead up to them becoming dads and I would have a heads up.\n\nSo my bro had called me last week and said, \u201ccongrats you\u2019re an uncle! You have a little nephew.\u201d\n\nAnd reflexively I just said, \u201coh nice, did you get a dog or a cat?\u201d\n\nMy bro was silent for a bit and I was thinking that\u2019s not a hard question? And he finally says, \u201ca human baby, we adopted a baby boy\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cshit sorry, that was fast.\u201d\n\nMy mom was absolutely HORRIFIED at this story and I\u2019ve been deemed the biggest family asshole this year over it. My brother doesn\u2019t seem mad, his husband seems to be very annoyed with me. No one understands why I would ask that, so I mean, idk, am I an AH here? I'm not neurotypical, so it's hard for me to know if maybe they're teasing me and not actually that mad. However, if this situation needs a real sit down kind of apology for me being a major AH then I want to do that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update**. Whoa this blew up overnight.\n\nI talked to my brother and BIL this morning and I told them like what I said here and I apologized. They said they are not mad at all and they thought it was funny. They said if they seemed upset it could be because a lot changed suddenly for them. So I think I could have misunderstood them being busy and tired for being annoyed.\n\nI asked what about the pause on the phone, because to me if someone takes longer than about 1 to 2 seconds to begin speaking after I speak, and especially if I count over 5 seconds, then probably that is confusion or surprise I believe. My brother said he wasn\u2019t sure if I was attempting a joke and he should laugh or if I was confused, that's what he was thinking in the pause. The family likes to tease me because when I learned about sarcasm in 1st grade I then tried it out and told my dad I had a terrible day at school when he asked (trying to be sarcastic) but my inflection was wrong so he thought I was serious\u2026 my brother was trying to figure out if that kind of thing was happening again. \n\nBut, as it turns out, actually no one in the family is mad at me. They apparently are all poking fun and I couldn\u2019t tell. My mom\u2019s reaction was apparently not horror in an angry way but in a funny disbelief kind of way. I feel a lot better about it now.", "created_utc": 1671596266, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zra169/aitah_because_when_my_brother_and_his_husband/", "score": 6453, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My sister and I howled with laughter. He was very embarrassed. But he didn\u2019t mean anything malicious.  I think this is kind of the same thing.

A lot of people these days talk about their pets as if they were children, and you didn\u2019t realize the process could happen like that, so I kind of get it, even though it\u2019s a pretty odd reaction. And I can also understand why your mom and brother-in-law feel a little like wtf, man. \n\nAnd honestly, for your brother and brother-in-law, it might be that you not having taken the time to learn how adoption works and what their experience or process was like might be more what was hurtful than the actual remark. I don\u2019t know, just speculating. \n\nAnyway an apology, a nice baby gift, and finding ways to show you\u2019re happy for them and support them all seem in order.", "NTA\n\nI laughed reading this. It was an honest misunderstanding.. Apologize for the misunderstanding, buy your nephew a great Christmas gift and share a laugh with the family.

Embarrassing but innocent mistake", "NAH. \n\nBut you should talk to your brother and his husband and let them know it was a genuine mistake. \n\nAs worded in your post, I agree with others that what you said doesn\u2019t make you an AH. \n\nBut what you say and what they heard clearly wasn\u2019t exactly the same thing. Consider your audience and how they might hear the same words but feel very differently about them. \n\nYour brother probably also was surprised and excited by the news he clearly just got. He and his husband probably had a serious talk about seizing this moment and maybe even had second thoughts. \n\nYou felt like you weren\u2019t ready to hear that your brother and his husband were parents yet, but what if your brother is feeling like maybe he isn\u2019t ready to BE a parent yet. As a new parent myself\u2014with the benefit of 9 months of prep!\u2014I can tell you the feeling is not uncommon. \n\nSo consider that, perhaps, your comment might have touched a nerve. Your immediate follow-up wasn\u2019t an apology or even a statement of joy\u2014rather, it was a comment about how sudden this was. This requires some smoothing. \n\nAnother possibility to consider is that your brother and his husband are a same-sex couple going through a difficult process that is made more difficult by the fact that many doors are closed to them simply because they are gay (for example, some religious adoption agencies don\u2019t place with same sex couples). \n\nYour brother and his husband may be getting some venom from strangers, friends, even family. I bet if you asked (now isn\u2019t the time), you might be shocked at how cruel people feel justified in being. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, think how it might have felt for your brother\u2014who was thrilled not only to tell you the news, but to do so in a way that highlighted how he wanted you to be involved (calling you an uncle)\u2014to get the reaction you gave. He may have had apprehension giving this news to some other people in his life, but clearly he was just purely excited and happy to share it with you. \n\nJust some thoughts for you\u2014I really don\u2019t think you are the AH, just a bit flustered.

When your brother told you you're an uncle and have a new nephew, the obvious inference is that he was referring to a human. I know a lot of people call themselves pet parents, consider their pets their children and sometimes apply other familial terms like \"pet uncle\" and so forth to their relatives, but it's a real stretch here to think your brother was referring to anything other than a baby.\n\nMaybe get them a little baby gift and tell them you didn't mean any offense and you were in such disbelief that the adoption happened so quickly you didn't think it was possible and that it never occured to you your brother was talking about a human baby.\n\nFor your own peace of mind, you should ask them if they're really angry with you over this or just teasing. They should know better than to tease you.", "NAH but you better come through with the extravagant baby shower gifts. With anything but cats and dogs on them.", "NAH lol.  Maybe your mom a little?\n\nI'm sorry.  I understand why your brother-in-law is a bit annoyed, it might not be a bad idea to talk with him with your brother there.  Give a genuine, sincere apology, but don't make a big production of it.  You really didn't mean it, it was a minor foot-in-mouth moment which you did not double-down on.

Asking for example if they adopted a cat or a dog when you know they wanted a baby. My niece does it all the time. She's desperate for attention and says the lost annoying things. There are plenty of ways to get attention without being annoying. You knew exactly what your brother was adopting I bet, you just chose to be annoying about it and ruin his thunder.", "NAH. Other than maybe your mother that seems to make it a little more dramatic than it was. \n\nThe fact that you DID apologize as soon as you where told it was a human baby, shows that shows that you did not mean to hurt than, which your brother clearly knew since he is not mad. \n\nAnd his husband might be annoyed due to 2 things. 1) that he is a little hurt by the mistake, maybe due to past interactions with people thinking that pets would be his children in the future due to being gay. Or 2) the fact that the whole thing have been blown up (by your mother) that all the focus is on you and not the baby.   \n\n\nHopefully this will be a funny story in the future.

We got a new puppy as I was standing on the balcony the downstairs neighbor (lived directly under me) was getting out of her car and mentioned the new pup as a new addition. I said we just got him and we\u2019re his antics too noisy. She said no, did her new addition bother us. I replied, \u2018no, what did you get?\u2019 She replied, \u2018I had a little girl\u2019; I had no idea she was pregnant, I just thought she was a little over weight.

Adoption generally is a long drawn out process to my understanding so having it be sudden would definitely throw most people off.

NAH of course no ones an asshole there except for maybe the mom that's too outragable. In fact its hilarious. A deadpan response like your brother's is the best comeback to it too.", "NAH.

I think it's an honest mistake.", "As hilarious as that is, I would suggest sitting down with them and apologizing, and explaining \"Hey im neurodivergent and this is how my brain works-- I thought it would be a longer process with frequent updates, and Im sorry that I interpreted the announcement wrong.\" Express your excitement for them if that is what you're feeling as well.\n\nMaybe you all can laugh about it afterwards <3\n\nNta btw, but as an autistic adult myself? Its a funny fuck up tbh", "NAH. For many couples adoption really does take such a long time so believing it was too soon for them to already have a baby was not unreasonable. Also so many people now treat pet adoption as if it were a baby adoption that you were not unreasonable in assuming that was the case. You certainly shouldn't be considered an AH for an honest mistake. I think the important thing here is that it sounds like you tried to have a positive response being excited for them even if you thought it was only a pet adoption. If you are unsure about how your family is feeling it might be good to talk to them about it just so you can move on and not have to worry about trying to figure it out any more. This truly doesn't sound like something anyone should be angry about.", "This was hilarious and something at least 3 out of my 7 siblings might do too. You had a \u201cbrain fart\u201d it happens. Go buy your new nephew something sweet and congratulate your brother and partner NTA", "NAH. But the annoyance and dissapointment is real and a little valid. Its a big deal they just adopted a baby, especially to them and without meaning to you accidently equated it to getting a dog or cat. Also you knew they were looking to adopt a child and you asked about a animal when they said you were an uncle.\n\nI'd sit them down, apologize for accidentally ruining their announcement. (Thats what this is mostly about. It was supposed to be all heartwarming and wonderful when they finally got to say they were parents and it didnt happen. Now it wasnt the worst thing that could have happened it still put a damper on their happy moment) Let them know you honestly didnt know how adoption can work and had a very different idea to it and while thats not their fault or problem id did lead you to going to \"automatic default\" next possibility because in your mind there was just absolutely no way they were talking about a human baby.\n\nI know, i know. If no one is the ass then why should anyone apologize. Because thats good people behavior. Opening up the talk to bring back warm and joy into bringing the baby home is the goal, it also gives them an oportunity to be sympathetic see things from OPs perspective and even apologize back for being a little harsh in their behavior toward him since. (Which i also feel doesnt make them an ass because they are disappointed and allowed to feel those emotions as long as they are not being outright hostile toward OP over it. Being a little 'annoyed' is a very okay way to be at this time, but can very much be worked through with communication)\n\nCongrats on your new nephew OP!\n\nAlso something important that ive adapted as a non neurotypical person myself is to tell them before you even start explaining is not to interupt you till youre done. I can take a long time to get my point across and something talk in fragments and dont explain things in 'order' if that makes sense and i often get interrupted by incorrect assumptions just because i didnt get to say my whole piece before they started commenting on it.", "NAH, mother overreacted though. It was a simple mistake, that a lot of people would have made.", "NTA. I- \nI\u2019m confused, why would someone make it such a big deal??? Like, i understand they might be taken aback, cause maybe they thought it \u201chomophobic\u201d(????), but it\u2019s just a question, in no way that implies you think gay couples can\u2019t have a child??? Like, it is in fact very difficult for two men to have a child, so it makes sense you first thought it wasn\u2019t a human child???\n\ud83d\udc80 deadass, it\u2019s just something to laugh about.\nThese people are weeeeeeird.\nYou did nothing wrong.\nYou don\u2019t have to apologise, but all of you definitely need to sit down and talk it through.\nIm not neurotypical either, and i can\u2019t really understand whether it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re teasing you, i can\u2019t see the point of that, or if it\u2019s a thing.\nAnd i also don\u2019t know if them being this offended is normal(????)\nSo yeah, maybe give them your apology, and ask them what it is about that question that caused such strong feelings. I think the apology should mainly be on the lines of \u201cI\u2019m sorry i offended you, may i know why it caused such problems, so to avoid similar incidents in the future?\u201d\nWeird af \ud83d\ude10\ud83e\udee5\ud83e\udee4\ud83e\udee1", "NAH.

However, I think it would be best to sit them down and explain that you didn't realise the process moved so quickly which is why you had that reaction, but you are absolutely thrilled for them. It would also be nice to bring them some sort of gift for baby- Google will help with ideas if they don't have a registry. Something that I like is getting bub some clothes for when they get bigger (explain that you understand that they won't fit him now, but you were hoping to avoid them getting heaps of clothes at newborn size).

It sounds like it was a baby surrendered to a firehouse. Therefore it would have ended up in the public/or government side which is usually called the foster system. When trying to adopt you can go the private or public route but if it\u2019s the public route it would technically be through the foster system. The reason for the difference is private adoption is extremely expensive but through the foster care system often you don\u2019t pay anything. It\u2019s pretty rare (at least where I am from) to get a newborn though the government based system so when there is a child so young that was surrendered it doesn\u2019t end up in foster care but instead focused straight into adoption. Again I can\u2019t speak of everywhere and how their programs are run but where I am within the foster system there are two avenues. One is foster to adopt and the other is just to be a foster parent. I was just trying to clarify why this would happen so fast because the gut instinct of it should take longer is correct.", "Must've spelt \"dog\" wrong lol", "Mine is the same, she loves having a conversation if you are willing to keep talking to her.", "\u2026 thank you. That was enlightening", "I think the word foster is getting things confused. It\u2019s not fostering the way we typically think about it. It just that public adoptions are run through the same umbrella as the foster system. Think of it as one organization with two separate roles. People who foster to adopt are not necessary fostering at all especially if they are looking to adopt babies vs older children.", "How would you even get on the list for public adoptions? Would you not already need to be an approved foster parent?", "From what op said they were already in the process of adoption. So, again I\u2019m guessing based on the limited information I have available to me, but I would assume they decided to take the public route instead of the private. They would have already had been screened to be approved for adoption at which point they would have been placed on a waitlist. At that point it\u2019s just a waiting game of when child that would be a good fit for your family becomes available and where you are on the waitlist. Once approved to adopt it can be anywhere from the next day to years before you get a child.\n\nEdit: wanted to add that there is actually a chance OPs brother is technically fostering right now. Many foster to adopt programs require a certain amount of time before you can officially adopt the child. If that was the case I would imagine that OPs brother isn\u2019t worried about the semantics because to him this is his son whether or not it is official yet.", "The correct response would have to been to laugh their ass off at that. Not get upset lol that shit is a funny harmless mistake.", "I knowing get downvoted for this but YTA.  This is the type of passive homophobia that society teaches us.  Would you have just assumed they adopted a cat or dog if it had been a straight couple?  Yeah probably not.  I don't think OP had any bad intentions in assuming this.  Like I said I think it's the passive homophobia society teaches us.  It's reinforced by television shows that show gay people and their fur babies.  Nothing wrong with fur babies.  My bf and I have 2.  You shouldn't assume though when someone says they have a new child that it's actually a pet.  You're basically inferring they can't be \"real\" parents so they adopted a cat or dog instead.  OP's bro and partner deserve a sincere apology.\n\nThis is the equivalent of a black friend telling you they got a new job and you assume they're working as a maid/butler.

If not, I hope someday you can.", "NTA, dumbass would be more accurate but soft dumbass.", "NTA, adoption processes usually (and afaik nearly 100% of the time) take an incredibly long time.", "NTA. Given the timings I would also have expected them to have adopted an animal instead of a human.

And since you don\u2019t have any wounded pride or feelings yourself about your mistake, I think an open inquisitive talk with your brother is a good idea.

It might turn out that it actually touched on something else related and mostly have nothing to do with your blunder but I\u2019m sure he\u2019d like to talk to you about it because he called you with his news with pure joy to share it with you.

I'm sure you'll all laugh about it in the future.", "NAH. I laughed pretty hard. I get why the joke might not land with some people but you didn't do it to be mean. A lot of adoptions don't happen that fast unless it's an animal shelter so I get why you made the assumption.", "NTA. You can't help it if your brother is overly sensitive. Do you always have to walk on eggshells around him?", "NAH I think it is kinda funny and the fact you apologized right after realizing your mistake makes up for it.", "NAH. Adoption *is* normally a long and complicated process, so I don't blame you for not thinking about a human baby.

I think your mom is over-reacting. Just explain what you thought to your brother and his husband. Ask if they are upset and apologize if they are. You say your brother is not, but just make sure.

Most people I know who have adopted or are adopted are pretty unhappy about how people compare animals to humans in this context, and with good reason. It's dehumanizing. I think you should learn more about adoption and be more sensitive.

Adoption is generally *extremely* slow and you didn't do anything wrong by assuming that theirs would follow usual timeframes.\n\nAlso it's kind of a weird thing to be upset over.", "NAH, that was hilarious. But it probably wouldn't hurt to apologize for your assumptions anyways.", "NTA it is hilarious.    \n\n\nRecently we got two new kittens and while holding one I told my human teenage child I loved the kitten best of all my kids HA HA HA HA She agreed that was fair since the kitten is so cute.", "I would let them know your question was genuine not meant to demean their process of becoming parents, you just genuinely didn\u2019t know it could go that fast  and start loving up on that kid.

Asking for a friend xD", "Eh, you do you but \u201cany normal person\u201d would probably not be proud of that. :)", ">Your cat listens?????\n\n\"Lay down\"\n\n\"Come eat\"\n\nJust have to say the right words :)", "I have the same reaction to sweetheart too. No idea why. \n\nI''m a huge fan of Gretchen Rubin (the Happiness Project). Unfortunately she uses the word sweetheart 100% of the time when she's talking about a husband wife partner boyfriend girlfriend anything. It makes me nuts.", "I trained my cats to sit on command. Well, one sits when I tell him to most of the time and the other sits down in the wrong spot sometimes and makes it very clear that it was her own decision and not because I told her to but if I want to bring a treat to her she might be humble enough to accept it... Maybe.", "A reasonable reaction since many of us have had it used against us in a condescending, demeaning manner.", "Ah. You know, I never thought of that, but you may be right. I know it really really irritates me for some reason.", "I have one and a half Siamese. The one who never shuts the fuck up is the half. He\u2019s also the devil incarnate, but I love him anyways.", "I definitely laughed out loud at the original post (and the reason for thinking it was maybe pets is sound).  For what it\u2019s worth, my sister actually references me as \u201caunt\u201d to her cat - the first time I heard it, I was kind of weirded out but now I use it myself.\n\nSecondly, the edits are amazing!  OP, I am so glad that this all worked out with a bit of communication. And your family dynamics are hysterical - I love that you all have this amazing sense of humour. Also, imagining 6 year old you thinking over snd trying out sarcasm is just too cute.\n\nCongratulations on your nephew! You should get him his own plushie fur baby as a joke (which also doubles as a nice gift). Maybe both a sibling stuffed cat and dog.", "NTA. Have you ever checked if you are on the autism spectrum? The sarcasm thing resonated. It might help you understand the world better if you are and you don't know. Maybe not. But doesn't hurt to think about it for a second.", "My sister asked if I was a rabbit when our parents told her they were pregnant with me(she was six and had been asking for a rabbit). 30 years later we still joke about it.", "Thank you, I think I will get him a stuffed dog to continue the joke now. \n\nAnd yeah, I have a lot of stories like that where I just didn't understand something. After I said I had a terrible day my dad was asking me what was wrong, he asked did someone say something mean? And I was very upset he didn\u2019t understand so I crossed my arms to convey this and said, \u201cOh, dad. I am going to teach you about sarcasm. It\u2019s when you use words that mean the opposite of something.\u201d Everyone in the car burst out laughing. Now it\u2019s a running joke, when my dad asks a question, someone will respond, \u201coh dad, I am going to teach you.\u201d\n\nOr, once my parents sat us down to say a family member had a hear attack. I was little, maybe kindergarten age. I said, \"oh, that's no big deal, dad has one everyday.\" Because he would tell us, '*don't do that, you just gave me a heart attack!'* I thought he was serious and informing us our actions caused him to have heart attack, but he was fine therefore heart attacks were no big deal.", "I do have autism", "And counting seconds of pause to determine emotional reactions. No NT person does that.", "I would have assumed the same thing if anyone said that to me, I am not good at interpreting meaning if people don\u2019t tell me exactly what they mean. My sister calls me an uncle to her dogs, she is straight, so idk. I talked to them about it this morning and it turns out they weren\u2019t upset with me because they understand my autism sometimes causes me to misunderstand what\u2019s going on and so they found it funny. I would never mean to say they aren\u2019t good dads for being gay, I feel really bad that I could be inferred to mean that. I really didn\u2019t mean anything bad because I am very excited for them to have a baby now, I just genuinely didn\u2019t know they could get a baby overnight like that and they didn\u2019t even have a nursery set up before. It was a conversation we had months ago about them adopting and then we didn\u2019t talk about it much in detail again, all I knew was they had to take some kind of class and then like I said I thought there would be a process where they tell us someone picked them and then they would eventually go to the hospital and see the baby born, I wasn\u2019t sure. I was just surprised, not trying to be homophobic, so I\u2019m really sorry I could have implied that I didn\u2019t see how my words could be connected to that but a couple comments have said that so idk I might say sorry again to them I just feel really bad about maybe having hurt them.", "I'm pretty sure all my parents pets, dogs and cats alike, viewed my sister and I as puppies growing up given how they treated us", "This is absolutely horrifying and I love it.", "I usually take the revenant approach and call people skin bags", "Yeah I agree that the family is being totally unreasonable regardless of whether or not they're neurotypical.\n\nJust saying that if they are neurotypical, they should get a bit more leeway from their family on \"social norms\". I barely get them right most of the time.\n\nThe adoption process is pretty crazy from the limited info I've gotten about it. It seems like most people have to wait years if they want a baby. Not sure about older kids though.", "Not a free pass for big things but this is a tiny misunderstanding and since op has a hard time understanding if people are actually upset they might not be upset at all. With how long adoption takes and the rising popularity of people calling themselves animal parents and considering their pets to be their children, it's a heat of the moment mistake neurotypicals could make too.", "Our dog was like that too, kept his eyes on the baby except if the baby was napping then would be near the baby but facing the door. He was a very good boy (the dog- the baby was pretty good too but learned to climb early so a bit terrifying). \nI have memories of my childhood dog herding me home from the park or if I rode my bike too far from the house (border collie x) she was like the long arm of my mother lol.", " Ed...ward", "They are!  Google American Hairless Terrier.", "I feel like I've become used to fur babies just because it's so common. But skin puppy is just... No. So gross \n\nAnd totally agree on mama bear. And almost every time I hear it it's them wanting to overreact to a petty situation", "\u201cDo you want cuddles?\u201d\n\u201cTreats?\u201d\n\u201cWHAT ARE YOU EATING\u201d to activate flight response because he is once again eating plastic. \n\nI also try to reason with them ike they\u2019re toddlers. \u201cIf your sister makes those noise that means she\u2019s done so knock it off\u201d\n\u201cYou got hurt because you were being cautious enough now come here\u201d \u201cif you eat now then when breakfast comes you\u2019ll be even more hungry so please be done\u201d\n\nWorking as a preschool teacher was a mistake.", "Oh my gosh, they are so freaking adorable \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\ude2d \ud83d\udc96! Thank you!", "Skin puppy is well like you said so gross. \n\nAnd you really nailed the mama bear type. Also you just know if they ever met an actually mama bear they'd be wetting their pants. I mean we probably all would, but they're the only ones who think they wouldn't.", "Siamese are soooo vocal. And their meow is so distinctive.", "Much to my grandma in-law's (she has had dozens of cats over her lifetime) amazement, I taught one of our cats to sit. He will happily do so because he loves treats. Somehow, he maintains his athletic build. Our other cat is, um... not very smart. Very sweet & cuddly, though.", "Did they name her pony? There someone in our village with that name.", "... may you step on several legos for reminding me of that.", "Thanks for your advice, I will absolutely be using this in the future!", "Lol, I would've leaned into it and bought a special bowl and everything. But I'm a demented dog lady. So what do ik.", "Username checks out.", "Same. Those poor babies.", "My sister & I had a game called \"tasters\" when we were little. Basically one of us would mix any 3 ingredients we could find in the kitchen, and the other would guess what it was. We pretty quickly had to implement a \"no dog food\" rule, as that went in the mix basically every time \ud83e\udd23", "The fact that you specified \"not a bear\" about fucking killed me \ud83e\udd23", "And also, much like most things, if you have to say it, you ain't it. The real mom you have to worry about aren't the ones going around calling themselves mama bears."]}
