I don\u2019t know anything about the process so I guess I thought a pregnant woman looked through stacks of applicants, picked some family, met with them, and they went to the hospital to get the baby when it was born. Basically I thought there would be a lot of lead up to them becoming dads and I would have a heads up.\n\nSo my bro had called me last week and said, \u201ccongrats you\u2019re an uncle! You have a little nephew.\u201d \n\nAnd reflexively I just said, \u201coh nice, did you get a dog or a cat?\u201d \n\nMy bro was silent for a bit and I was thinking that\u2019s not a hard question?

There's different avenues for adoption, so I can understand your confusion. Send the happy couple a nice gift. You can always make it a joke with the kid later on, depending on his sense of humor, of course. And congrats on your new nephew!", "NAH, you misunderstood and some hurt feelings resulted. A genuine apology and a shift to genuine celebration of the new baby should start the process of reassuring your BIL and other family members that it was an honest mistake and that you really are happy for them.", "NTA, I'd have probably said the same. It might be worth sitting down with them and letting them know you're happy and excited for them but was a bit shocked at the sudden news. Congrats to your brother and partner.  I'm sure they'll be far too busy with the baby to worry much about your reaction.", "NAH lol... you're family is pretty drama-free if this is the biggest f up of the year.  If I were you, I would just apologize anyway to keep the peace. It was an honest mistake. I'm almost 30 and I still get surprised when friends announce pregnancies.", "If thats the exact phrasing then your NTA and nobody is on my opinion. It was a mistake and you were sorry and there its done", "Have you explained to them why you said that? What you thought the adoption process was? If you haven\u2019t then you probably should. It would probably take their \u201cyou\u2019re an asshole\u201d to a \u201comg that\u2019s hilarious\u201d", "NTA, I don\u2019t think you did anything malicious. You just didn\u2019t understand. They will forgive you.  Just make sure you sincerely apologize and tell them how happy you are for them.\nLet them know that you didn\u2019t understand and you were a little surprised at first. It was an honest mistake\n\nBefore my husband and I got married, my sister had just given birth to her youngest daughter and we were visiting her at the hospital. \nI was holding my niece and my very na\u00efve husband to be, was looking down at her and he asked in his best serious yet inquisitive voice: when she would \u201copen her eyes\u201d, I looked at him and I said she\u2019s not a kitten. He was very embarrassed. But he didn\u2019t mean anything malicious.  I think this is kind of the same thing. Not exactly but you see where I\u2019m coming from.\n\n(edit to add: 20 years later, we still giggle about this)", "NAH\n\nThis is hilarious and once the hurt feelings die down a bit it will just be a funny story. An apology and a baby gift might speed up the process.", "NTA, but in my family you\u2019d definitely be getting teased about it for all eternity.", "NTA. It was an honest mistake (sounds like), and I think your brother accepts that this was shocking GOOD news that you were not expecting to hear in this timeframe. Congratulations, by the way! Many blessings to your family.", "NTA. This is the kind of story your family *should* be able to look back on and laugh at. A kind of \"silly Uncle OP, he thought when we told him he was an uncle that we got a pet\". Emotions are running a bit high at the moment, so give it a while to calm down.\n\nYou probably should have realised they meant a baby, but it's a much better story that you didn't.", "NTA, thats bloody hilarious,  110% I'd do the same.  I thought adoption dragged out for a long time", "NAH. In the grand scheme of life, sooner or later we all put our foot in our mouth. Congratulations on being an uncle to a tiny human who is hopefully awesome even if he is not a dog or cat. For the sake of humor, you really do need to gift your nephew a dog or cat onesie. (Check with your brother to figure out what size the baby is).", "NTA. It was an honest mistake.", "NAH It was an honest misunderstanding based on what you said. I feel like either there's information missing that explains their response, or maybe you just haven't yet communicated properly to them the misunderstanding. I would definitely make it clear that you were just caught off guard, because yet adopting a baby usually takes many years of waiting, so thought they meant they adopted from an animal shelter.", "NTA XD\nWe adopted a bearded dragon the other month. And it's just natural to say adopted vs bought. Especially with most animals being adopted lately.", "NTA, but this is exactly what I would have said because I know how long the adoption process usually is for babies (long.) \n\nBuy your wee nephew a gift (within your means), bring it to your brother and say you are once again sorry and it was an accident.", "NTA honest mistake and that's funny as all heck. But your mothers reaction makes her an AH and depending on how your brother in law acts he could be too. Tbh though it's not a big deal, I would just talk it out, apologize, and laugh over it for the rest of time. Your not a major AH, your not even a small one, and anyone, including nuerotypical people, could have made this mistake.", "YTA but not a big one. just kind of thoughtless", "YTA\n\nWhen someone says \"you're an uncle, you have a nephew\", any normal person would correctly infer that they adopted a child, not an animal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A lot of people these days talk about their pets as if they were children, and you didn\u2019t realize the process could happen like that, so I kind of get it, even though it\u2019s a pretty odd reaction. And I can also understand why your mom and brother-in-law feel a little like wtf, man. \n\nAnd honestly, for your brother and brother-in-law, it might be that you not having taken the time to learn how adoption works and what their experience or process was like might be more what was hurtful than the actual remark. I don\u2019t know, just speculating. \n\nAnyway an apology, a nice baby gift, and finding ways to show you\u2019re happy for them and support them all seem in order.", "NTA\n\nI laughed reading this. It was an honest misunderstanding.. Apologize for the misunderstanding, buy your nephew a great Christmas gift and share a laugh with the family. If I were your brother I would absolutely see the humor in the situation but I might also never let you live it down. Congrats and enjoy your nephew's first holiday season.", "NAH. It was funny.", "LOL! This is family joke worthy not be upset worthy!! Damn. NTA. This guy has a new baby at home and THAT'S what he's worried about??", "NAH. Embarrassing but innocent mistake", "NAH. \n\nBut you should talk to your brother and his husband and let them know it was a genuine mistake. \n\nAs worded in your post, I agree with others that what you said doesn\u2019t make you an AH. \n\nBut what you say and what they heard clearly wasn\u2019t exactly the same thing. Consider your audience and how they might hear the same words but feel very differently about them. \n\nYour brother probably also was surprised and excited by the news he clearly just got. He and his husband probably had a serious talk about seizing this moment and maybe even had second thoughts. \n\nYou felt like you weren\u2019t ready to hear that your brother and his husband were parents yet, but what if your brother is feeling like maybe he isn\u2019t ready to BE a parent yet. As a new parent myself\u2014with the benefit of 9 months of prep!\u2014I can tell you the feeling is not uncommon. \n\nSo consider that, perhaps, your comment might have touched a nerve. Your immediate follow-up wasn\u2019t an apology or even a statement of joy\u2014rather, it was a comment about how sudden this was. This requires some smoothing. \n\nAnother possibility to consider is that your brother and his husband are a same-sex couple going through a difficult process that is made more difficult by the fact that many doors are closed to them simply because they are gay (for example, some religious adoption agencies don\u2019t place with same sex couples). \n\nYour brother and his husband may be getting some venom from strangers, friends, even family. I bet if you asked (now isn\u2019t the time), you might be shocked at how cruel people feel justified in being. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, think how it might have felt for your brother\u2014who was thrilled not only to tell you the news, but to do so in a way that highlighted how he wanted you to be involved (calling you an uncle)\u2014to get the reaction you gave. He may have had apprehension giving this news to some other people in his life, but clearly he was just purely excited and happy to share it with you. \n\nJust some thoughts for you\u2014I really don\u2019t think you are the AH, just a bit flustered. When I\u2019m caught off guard and make a foot-in-mouth comment, it can be the worst feeling. You\u2019re going to be fine\u2014and a great uncle.", "NAH\n\nI have found a member of my tribe,  the tribe called \"My foot lives in my mouth,  sorry about the awkward silence.\"\n\nI say random stuff too,  no worries. Apologize,  bring a nice baby gift and if you feel petty (a secret club within our tribe,  invitation only,  check your email for a link) also bring a dog toy.", "Yeah, YTA. When your brother told you you're an uncle and have a new nephew, the obvious inference he was referring to a human. I know a lot of people call themselves pet parents, consider their pets their children and sometimes apply other familial terms like \"pet uncle\" and so forth to their relatives, but it's a real stretch here to think your brother was referring to anything other than a baby.\n\nMaybe get them a little baby gift and tell them you didn't mean any offense and you were in such disbelief that the adoption happened so quickly you didn't think it was possible that it never occured to you your brother was talking about a human baby. \n\nFor your own peace of mind, you should ask them if they're really angry with you over this or just teasing. They should know better than to tease you.", "NAH but you better come through with the extravagant baby shower gifts. With anything but cats and dogs on them.", "NAH lol.  Maybe your mom a little?\n\nI'm sorry.  I understand why your brother-in-law is a bit annoyed, it might not be a bad idea to talk with him with your brother there.  Give a genuine, sincere apology, but don't make a big production of it.  You really didn't mean it, it was a minor foot-in-mouth moment which you did not double-down on.  It was a small error based on a misunderstanding of the process, and it warrants an explanation and a small, sincere apology to smooth things over.  Make sure they both know how happy you are for them!  :)\n\nThis is going to be a funny story for them someday.\n\nYour mom, however, is taking it way more seriously than she needs to and needs to not be fueling things.  You are not a gigantic asshole, you made a minor error.", "NTA XD\nWe adopted a bearded dragon the other month. And it's just natural to say adopted vs bought. Especially with most animals being adopted lately. \n\nI don't think anyone should be mad at you over a misunderstanding. It's hard to adopt a baby.", "YTA, sounds like there was no apology here. One is needed to redeem AH status. It's a misunderstanding and hopefully can be smoothed over with a heart to heart", "I did too \ud83e\udd23 especially because our dogs are our children, and I have \u201chuman babies.\u201d My youngest holds our puppy and says \u201cyou\u2019re my child\u201d so it made me laugh EXTRA hard because I\u2019d be as confused. \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "What i thought too", "I agree with this, since even thought ur bro called u uncle, sometimes at the spur of the moment you may be thinking of something else, which in this case could have been a dog or cat", "I was thinking the same thing! In five years this is going to be one of those stories everyone thinks is adorable and hilarious. NTA at all.", "Mabey I\u2019m wrong. But i don\u2019t think there was any bad intentions behind it and they did say sorry if you get what i mean", "Maybe I\u2019m not normal, but I consider my dog my daughter and my brother\u2019s cat my niece. That doesn\u2019t take away from the joy of human babies being added to the family.", "Thats adorable", "You can consider them that, as I know most people do, but at the end of the day, pets are property.
