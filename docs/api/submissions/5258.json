And I can also understand why your mom and brother-in-law feel a little like wtf, man. \n\nAnd honestly, for your brother and brother-in-law, it might be that you not having taken the time to learn how adoption works and what their experience or process was like might be more what was hurtful than the actual remark. I don\u2019t know, just speculating. \n\nAnyway an apology, a nice baby gift, and finding ways to show you\u2019re happy for them and support them all seem in order.", "NTA\n\nI laughed reading this. It was an honest misunderstanding.. Apologize for the misunderstanding, buy your nephew a great Christmas gift and share a laugh with the family.

Embarrassing but innocent mistake", "NAH. \n\nBut you should talk to your brother and his husband and let them know it was a genuine mistake. \n\nAs worded in your post, I agree with others that what you said doesn\u2019t make you an AH. \n\nBut what you say and what they heard clearly wasn\u2019t exactly the same thing. Consider your audience and how they might hear the same words but feel very differently about them. \n\nYour brother probably also was surprised and excited by the news he clearly just got. He and his husband probably had a serious talk about seizing this moment and maybe even had second thoughts. \n\nYou felt like you weren\u2019t ready to hear that your brother and his husband were parents yet, but what if your brother is feeling like maybe he isn\u2019t ready to BE a parent yet. As a new parent myself\u2014with the benefit of 9 months of prep!\u2014I can tell you the feeling is not uncommon. \n\nSo consider that, perhaps, your comment might have touched a nerve. Your immediate follow-up wasn\u2019t an apology or even a statement of joy\u2014rather, it was a comment about how sudden this was. This requires some smoothing. \n\nAnother possibility to consider is that your brother and his husband are a same-sex couple going through a difficult process that is made more difficult by the fact that many doors are closed to them simply because they are gay (for example, some religious adoption agencies don\u2019t place with same sex couples). \n\nYour brother and his husband may be getting some venom from strangers, friends, even family. I bet if you asked (now isn\u2019t the time), you might be shocked at how cruel people feel justified in being. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, think how it might have felt for your brother\u2014who was thrilled not only to tell you the news, but to do so in a way that highlighted how he wanted you to be involved (calling you an uncle)\u2014to get the reaction you gave. He may have had apprehension giving this news to some other people in his life, but clearly he was just purely excited and happy to share it with you. \n\nJust some thoughts for you\u2014I really don\u2019t think you are the AH, just a bit flustered.

When your brother told you you're an uncle and have a new nephew, the obvious inference he was referring to a human. I know a lot of people call themselves pet parents, consider their pets their children and sometimes apply other familial terms like \"pet uncle\" and so forth to their relatives, but it's a real stretch here to think your brother was referring to anything other than a baby.\n\nMaybe get them a little baby gift and tell them you didn't mean any offense and you were in such disbelief that the adoption happened so quickly you didn't think it was possible that it never occured to you your brother was talking about a human baby. \n\nFor your own peace of mind, you should ask them if they're really angry with you over this or just teasing. They should know better than to tease you.", "NAH but you better come through with the extravagant baby shower gifts. With anything but cats and dogs on them.", "NAH lol.  Maybe your mom a little?\n\nI'm sorry.  I understand why your brother-in-law is a bit annoyed, it might not be a bad idea to talk with him with your brother there.  Give a genuine, sincere apology, but don't make a big production of it.  You really didn't mean it, it was a minor foot-in-mouth moment which you did not double-down on.  It was a small error based on a misunderstanding of the process, and it warrants an explanation and a small, sincere apology to smooth things over.  Make sure they both know how happy you are for them!  :)\n\nThis is going to be a funny story for them someday.\n\nYour mom, however, is taking it way more seriously than she needs to and needs to not be fueling things.
