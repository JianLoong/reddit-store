And I can also understand why your mom and brother-in-law feel a little like wtf, man. \n\nAnd honestly, for your brother and brother-in-law, it might be that you not having taken the time to learn how adoption works and what their experience or process was like might be more what was hurtful than the actual remark. I don\u2019t know, just speculating. \n\nAnyway an apology, a nice baby gift, and finding ways to show you\u2019re happy for them and support them all seem in order.", "NTA\n\nI laughed reading this. It was an honest misunderstanding.. Apologize for the misunderstanding, buy your nephew a great Christmas gift and share a laugh with the family.

Embarrassing but innocent mistake", "NAH. \n\nBut you should talk to your brother and his husband and let them know it was a genuine mistake. \n\nAs worded in your post, I agree with others that what you said doesn\u2019t make you an AH. \n\nBut what you say and what they heard clearly wasn\u2019t exactly the same thing. Consider your audience and how they might hear the same words but feel very differently about them. \n\nYour brother probably also was surprised and excited by the news he clearly just got. He and his husband probably had a serious talk about seizing this moment and maybe even had second thoughts. \n\nYou felt like you weren\u2019t ready to hear that your brother and his husband were parents yet, but what if your brother is feeling like maybe he isn\u2019t ready to BE a parent yet. As a new parent myself\u2014with the benefit of 9 months of prep!\u2014I can tell you the feeling is not uncommon. \n\nSo consider that, perhaps, your comment might have touched a nerve. Your immediate follow-up wasn\u2019t an apology or even a statement of joy\u2014rather, it was a comment about how sudden this was. This requires some smoothing. \n\nAnother possibility to consider is that your brother and his husband are a same-sex couple going through a difficult process that is made more difficult by the fact that many doors are closed to them simply because they are gay (for example, some religious adoption agencies don\u2019t place with same sex couples). \n\nYour brother and his husband may be getting some venom from strangers, friends, even family. I bet if you asked (now isn\u2019t the time), you might be shocked at how cruel people feel justified in being. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, think how it might have felt for your brother\u2014who was thrilled not only to tell you the news, but to do so in a way that highlighted how he wanted you to be involved (calling you an uncle)\u2014to get the reaction you gave. He may have had apprehension giving this news to some other people in his life, but clearly he was just purely excited and happy to share it with you. \n\nJust some thoughts for you\u2014I really don\u2019t think you are the AH, just a bit flustered.

When your brother told you you're an uncle and have a new nephew, the obvious inference he was referring to a human. I know a lot of people call themselves pet parents, consider their pets their children and sometimes apply other familial terms like \"pet uncle\" and so forth to their relatives, but it's a real stretch here to think your brother was referring to anything other than a baby.\n\nMaybe get them a little baby gift and tell them you didn't mean any offense and you were in such disbelief that the adoption happened so quickly you didn't think it was possible that it never occured to you your brother was talking about a human baby. \n\nFor your own peace of mind, you should ask them if they're really angry with you over this or just teasing. They should know better than to tease you.", "NAH but you better come through with the extravagant baby shower gifts. With anything but cats and dogs on them.", "NAH lol.  Maybe your mom a little?\n\nI'm sorry.  I understand why your brother-in-law is a bit annoyed, it might not be a bad idea to talk with him with your brother there.  Give a genuine, sincere apology, but don't make a big production of it.  You really didn't mean it, it was a minor foot-in-mouth moment which you did not double-down on.  It was a small error based on a misunderstanding of the process, and it warrants an explanation and a small, sincere apology to smooth things over.  Make sure they both know how happy you are for them!  :)\n\nThis is going to be a funny story for them someday.\n\nYour mom, however, is taking it way more seriously than she needs to and needs to not be fueling things.

I suspect, given time, this will become a funny family story, one your nephew may even grow up to laugh about.", "NTA\nI'm sorry, but that is HILARIOUS", "That\u2019s innocent it was quick thing so usually only pets get adopted that fast", "NTA its hardly an offensive thing to ask. I\u2019m assuming you explained why you made that assumption?", "NAH. Easy mistake to make. If you're not sure if they're serious or teasing you should ask them upfront.", "NAH - although this may go down in family memory and the joke will be on you my friend.\n\nIt was an honest mistake, born of the relatively recent habit of being referred to as a dad or mum to pets", "NTA - I mean yeah, yikes, embarrassing but hopefully you'll all laugh about it later.", "NTA, you didn't do anything maliciously. You assumed that there would be some serious advance notice that they would be getting a baby to adopt. And usually that is the case. Just don't compound your error by calling the little one Rover or Tiger, unless of course one of those is the name they choose for their child.", "NAH. I can imagine your confusion regarding the length of time it takes to adopt a baby compared to a pet. I\u2019m surprised it wasn\u2019t laughed off immediately. \n\nIf brother in-law can\u2019t shake it off, and you are a good auntie, then maybe there is more behind the scenes that OP is not being made aware of.", "NAH and it makes sense bc yeah adoption can take years. I mean I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a post somewhere on here where a redditor is asking if their the A H bc they called their family saying they\u2019ve \u201cadopted\u201d and it was a dog/cat so everyone got butthurt about their little joke and somehow dehumanized the actual human adoption process yada yada you\u2019re fine.", "HAHAHAHA. You're screwed. Buy them a huge plushie, and Diapers, and balloons that read Welcome to the Family. Congrats to the New Dads.", "NTA, I very nearly accidentally ruined my cousin's pregnancy announcement in front of the family but luckily didn't get the joke out fast enough. When you're not expecting some serious news from someone close it's easy to just make a flippant joke like you normally would. Maybe apologise anyway, but make it clear you were surprised that it was so fast, weren't expecting more than a cat or dog at that time, and that you really are embarrassed by it.", "NTA. It was a good joke. Anyone getting over hurt over this is waaaayy too sensitive.", "INFO\n\nHave you explained it like you did here? Because \"shit sorry, that was fast\" doesn't really communicate the whole reasoning. Maybe they just don't understand your thinking.", "NTA. You apologized for the misunderstanding and had no ill intentions, it\u2019s not that serious so i\u2019m not sure why anyone involved would be upset.", "NTA because the same thing happened to a work friend of mine recently, her brother was like \u201ccongrats your going to be an Aunt!\u201d and her brain automatically assumed they got a dog and went, \u201cwhat breed is it?\u201d", "NAH\n\nI giggled. It's an honest mistake. Hell, my Mum knows I'm never having kids. Calls my dogs her grand-puppies.....", "NTA I know lots of people who refer to their pets as children so it was a legitimate response!", "If your family has an asshole of the year, yep, you may be it. Sounds like a lovely family.", "NAH but I would make a point of apologizing directly to your BIL if you haven't already, explain you thought it was a process that always took several months and with lots of stages between being chosen and the kid moving in and you were not trying to make light of their adoption process. Hes likely just feeling a little new parent protectiveness.", "NTA.  \n\nI\u2019m struggling to understand why anyone would be offended by this?  \n\nIs there a lot of pearl clutching in your family?  \n\nIf you were in our family this would go down as one of those legendary stories that got told every Christmas and the baby would probably get a new nickname like \u201cnibbles\u201d or something out of it.  \n\nThis is honestly hilarious and is supposed to be the kind of thing that becomes family stories that bond everyone together.  \n\nI really struggle to see why anyones offended.", "NAH. Also ND and that\u2019s the first question I would ask. LOL LOL LOL LOL", "I really laughed reading your reaction! NTA, but wouldn\u2019t hurt if you apologize for not being on the same channel when speaking with your brother.", "NTA. Considering how many people consider animals/pets to be their 'children' these days, your response doesn't surprise me.", "NTA lol this is a cute story to tell your nephew someday", "NTA. I am Mama to two fabulous cats who are very social kitties & several of my friends are aunties & uncles.  \n\nAnd, like so many others, I laughed out loud.", "NAH, similar thing happened to me\n\nMy friend who had a lot of pets said to me \"we're getting another baby\"\n\nI asked \"cat or dog?\"\n\nShe replied \"a human baby, I'm pregnant \"\n\nWe both laughed and moved on \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. That\u2019s hilarious \ud83d\ude02", "NAH even if this wasnt a mistake i'd say its still funny and not an asshole move", "NAH\n\nYou didn't mean to mess up. It was funny. If I were yout brother, I'd be laughing. Just apologize and say you misunderstood and goofed up but congrats and you're very happy for them.", "NTA that sounds like one of life's little jokes on you. But please apologize to your brother.", "NTA. I feel like I am either either a missing part of the story, or some of your family is overreacting in a major way.", "NAH.   \n\n\nThis is hilarious OP i would've had the same reaction seeing how fast they adopted you're fine!!", "In 18 years, you will tell this story at a toast for his birthday. Good story. NAH", "Yup, I lol'ed and agree, NAH. That said....when in genuine doubt as to whether or not you've hurt someone with whom you want to maintain good relations, offer a casual apology. At the very least, it gives them a chance to let you know they're not offended so you don't have to wonder/worry about it. (And if they *were* hurt, then you give them space to communicate that and can segue easily into a more complete/formal apology if needed.)", "It was an honest mistake. I'm almost 30 and I still get surprised when friends announce pregnancies.", "Seriously. This should be trivial and amusing, not controversial. NTA OP.", "Especially because they're not neurotypical like damn, give them a break.\n\nThe good news is they only have a week left until the year's over.", "Send a chew toy! ... I mean, teething ring.", "Why is the brother an asshole?", "Did you mean NAH or do you think the brother is an asshole?", "Like many of us op is part of the neuro spicy club and also was under the understandable impression that adoption takes for freaking ever. Calling op t a is ridiculous.", "I\u2019m also going to hell\u2026 I didn\u2019t even do a chuckle, I was straight up cackling \ud83d\ude02 NAH OP", "I told my mother that she doesn\u2019t get grandkids from me, only cats. And a gecko. She was upset at first but I think she\u2019s accepted it. Now we joke I\u2019m saving to put my cats through college. \n\nAlso NAH, really funny tho", "Few years back, my SIL and her husband (BIL) got a dog and they constantly call him their son/baby boy. \n\nWe were having Father's day brunch with them, and parent in laws. I was in the kitchen and I said to my BIL, \"Your first Father's Day! Congrats\".  \n\nMy MIL overheard us, thought her daughter was expecting and freaked out in excitement. We burst her bubble when I clarified that I was referring to his earlier insta post calling himself a dog daddy and was going to buy himself a nice bottle of whiskey to celebrate Father's Day.", "It would be sad if the child shan't find out begged then and miss the opportunity for years of teasing\n\n\"Woof, uncle Western development. Woof, Woof woof\"", "This is a bot! Pinched it from Acrobatic_Ad4519", "Wow, you went to the back of the elevator to hell on that one! \ud83d\ude02", "Who said he was?", "My mom and sister once yelled happy mothers day at me... I do not yet have children, I am not pregnant, was not pregnant at the time. \n\nMy response was \"do you know something I don't? I'm pretty sure I'm not pregnant...\" my mom laughed and was like \"yeah, but you have Olive (my cat)!\"\n\nSuch a weird moment.", "So is assuming someone adopted a DOG when they get a call congratulating them on becoming an uncle to a baby nephew.", "We say skin pets in our family \ud83d\ude02", "just coming in to say i absolutely adore the phrase \u201cskin dogs\u201d and will be using it CONSTANTLY from this point forward", "Right back where I came from. XD", "Because op isn't a \"normal\" person ya dunce therefore normal can't be applied to ops situation because they're neurodivergent and think and process differently than the average person", "My bf grandparents don\u2019t know if they will be great grandparents to actual kids so they adopted my dog and he is the grand puppy and is super spoiled when he sees them. Which isnt often since they are older and I\u2019m worried my giant doofus would accidentally knock them over considering he pushes me around when he gets super excited about his scratches and the lean."]}
