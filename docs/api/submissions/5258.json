And I can also understand why your mom and brother-in-law feel a little like wtf, man. \n\nAnd honestly, for your brother and brother-in-law, it might be that you not having taken the time to learn how adoption works and what their experience or process was like might be more what was hurtful than the actual remark. I don\u2019t know, just speculating. \n\nAnyway an apology, a nice baby gift, and finding ways to show you\u2019re happy for them and support them all seem in order.", "NTA\n\nI laughed reading this. It was an honest misunderstanding.. Apologize for the misunderstanding, buy your nephew a great Christmas gift and share a laugh with the family.

It was funny.", "LOL! This is family joke worthy not be upset worthy!! Damn. NTA. This guy has a new baby at home and THAT'S what he's worried about??", "NAH. Embarrassing but innocent mistake", "NAH. \n\nBut you should talk to your brother and his husband and let them know it was a genuine mistake. \n\nAs worded in your post, I agree with others that what you said doesn\u2019t make you an AH. \n\nBut what you say and what they heard clearly wasn\u2019t exactly the same thing. Consider your audience and how they might hear the same words but feel very differently about them. \n\nYour brother probably also was surprised and excited by the news he clearly just got. He and his husband probably had a serious talk about seizing this moment and maybe even had second thoughts. \n\nYou felt like you weren\u2019t ready to hear that your brother and his husband were parents yet, but what if your brother is feeling like maybe he isn\u2019t ready to BE a parent yet. As a new parent myself\u2014with the benefit of 9 months of prep!\u2014I can tell you the feeling is not uncommon. \n\nSo consider that, perhaps, your comment might have touched a nerve. Your immediate follow-up wasn\u2019t an apology or even a statement of joy\u2014rather, it was a comment about how sudden this was. This requires some smoothing. \n\nAnother possibility to consider is that your brother and his husband are a same-sex couple going through a difficult process that is made more difficult by the fact that many doors are closed to them simply because they are gay (for example, some religious adoption agencies don\u2019t place with same sex couples). \n\nYour brother and his husband may be getting some venom from strangers, friends, even family. I bet if you asked (now isn\u2019t the time), you might be shocked at how cruel people feel justified in being. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case, think how it might have felt for your brother\u2014who was thrilled not only to tell you the news, but to do so in a way that highlighted how he wanted you to be involved (calling you an uncle)\u2014to get the reaction you gave. He may have had apprehension giving this news to some other people in his life, but clearly he was just purely excited and happy to share it with you. \n\nJust some thoughts for you\u2014I really don\u2019t think you are the AH, just a bit flustered. When I\u2019m caught off guard and make a foot-in-mouth comment, it can be the worst feeling.

When your brother told you you're an uncle and have a new nephew, the obvious inference is that he was referring to a human. I know a lot of people call themselves pet parents, consider their pets their children and sometimes apply other familial terms like \"pet uncle\" and so forth to their relatives, but it's a real stretch here to think your brother was referring to anything other than a baby.\n\nMaybe get them a little baby gift and tell them you didn't mean any offense and you were in such disbelief that the adoption happened so quickly you didn't think it was possible and that it never occured to you your brother was talking about a human baby.\n\nFor your own peace of mind, you should ask them if they're really angry with you over this or just teasing. They should know better than to tease you.", "NAH but you better come through with the extravagant baby shower gifts. With anything but cats and dogs on them.", "NAH lol.  Maybe your mom a little?\n\nI'm sorry.  I understand why your brother-in-law is a bit annoyed, it might not be a bad idea to talk with him with your brother there.  Give a genuine, sincere apology, but don't make a big production of it.  You really didn't mean it, it was a minor foot-in-mouth moment which you did not double-down on.  It was a small error based on a misunderstanding of the process, and it warrants an explanation and a small, sincere apology to smooth things over.  Make sure they both know how happy you are for them!  :)\n\nThis is going to be a funny story for them someday.\n\nYour mom, however, is taking it way more seriously than she needs to and needs to not be fueling things.

I feel like this will actually be a funny story for your nephew in a few years.", "NAH, but that's hilarious.

This is fucking hilarious.", "I think they're less upset about what was obviously a joke and maybe more offended that someone thought it was a \"quick\" process when there is so much going on behind the scenes.

I think it's adorable. Quite often adoption is a long process so you're not wrong at all. I think this will be a funny story to tell before long. You weren't offensive in the least", "Nah. But i tought it was diffecult adopting a kid. How could they do that so fast? I understand your tought. But it's funny \ud83d\ude06", "NAH, I can understand your thought process. many years ago I lived in an upstairs apt. We got a new puppy as I was standing on the balcony the downstairs neighbor (lived directly under me) was getting out of her car and mentioned the new pup as a new addition. I said we just got him and we\u2019re his antics too noisy. She said no, did her new addition bother us. I replied, \u2018no, what did you get?\u2019 She replied, \u2018I had a little girl\u2019; I had no idea she was pregnant, I just thought she was a little over weight.  I was so embarrassed.", "Not major but you should apologize. The \u201cthat was fast\u201d could come off a bit rude", "NAh it\u2019s an honest mistake.", "NAH I honestly would have done this same if was told \u201chey we have a new baby!\u201d with no context and no sign of a baby arriving previously.", "NAH. Adoption generally is a long drawn out process to my understanding so having it be sudden would definitely throw most people off. I would just sit them down and apologize and explain you were thrown off because you thought it would take longer. It\u2019s clear you didn\u2019t mean harm by it.", "Hah. NAH of course no ones an asshole there except for maybe the mom that's too outragable. In fact its hilarious. A deadpan response like your brother's is the best comeback to it too.", "NAH. You explained why you thought what you thought, I think after the initial \"uh, no...\" It should just be laughed off to he honest.", "NTA. Looks like your family needs some sense of humor.", "NTA\n\nSomeone people call their animals their babies, you have nothing to be ashamed of.", "NTA. I think it's an honest mistake.", "As hilarious as that is, I would suggest sitting down with them and apologizing, and explaining \"Hey im neurodivergent and this is how my brain works-- I thought it would be a longer process with frequent updates, and Im sorry that I interpreted the announcement wrong.\" Express your excitement for them if that is what you're feeling as well.\n\nMaybe you all can laugh about it afterwards <3\n\nNta btw, but as an autistic adult myself? Its a funny fuck up tbh", "NAH. For many couples adoption really does take such a long time so believing it was too soon for them to already have a baby was not unreasonable. Also so many people now treat pet adoption as if it were a baby adoption that you were not unreasonable in assuming that was the case. You certainly shouldn't be considered an AH for an honest mistake. I think the important thing here is that it sounds like you tried to have a positive response being excited for them even if you thought it was only a pet adoption. If you are unsure about how your family is feeling it might be good to talk to them about it just so you can move on and not have to worry about trying to figure it out any more. This truly doesn't sound like something anyone should be angry about.", "This was hilarious and something at least 3 out of my 7 siblings might do too. You had a \u201cbrain fart\u201d it happens. Go buy your new nephew something sweet and congratulate your brother and partner NTA", "NAH. But the annoyance and dissapointment is real and a little valid. Its a big deal they just adopted a baby, especially to them and without meaning to you accidently equated it to getting a dog or cat. Also you knew they were looking to adopt a child and you asked about a animal when they said you were an uncle.\n\nI'd sit them down, apologize for accidentally ruining their announcement. (Thats what this is mostly about. It was supposed to be all heartwarming and wonderful when they finally got to say they were parents and it didnt happen. Now it wasnt the worst thing that could have happened it still put a damper on their happy moment) Let them know you honestly didnt know how adoption can work and had a very different idea to it and while thats not their fault or problem id did lead you to going to \"automatic default\" next possibility because in your mind there was just absolutely no way they were talking about a human baby.\n\nI know, i know. If no one is the ass then why should anyone apologize. Because thats good people behavior. Opening up the talk to bring back warm and joy into bringing the baby home is the goal, it also gives them an oportunity to be sympathetic see things from OPs perspective and even apologize back for being a little harsh in their behavior toward him since. (Which i also feel doesnt make them an ass because they are disappointed and allowed to feel those emotions as long as they are not being outright hostile toward OP over it. Being a little 'annoyed' is a very okay way to be at this time, but can very much be worked through with communication)\n\nCongrats on your new nephew OP!\n\nAlso something important that ive adapted as a non neurotypical person myself is to tell them before you even start explaining is not to interupt you till youre done. I can take a long time to get my point across and something talk in fragments and dont explain things in 'order' if that makes sense and i often get interrupted by incorrect assumptions just because i didnt get to say my whole piece before they started commenting on it.", "NAH, mother overreacted though. It was a simple mistake, that a lot of people would have made.", "NTA. I- \nI\u2019m confused, why would someone make it such a big deal??? Like, i understand they might be taken aback, cause maybe they thought it \u201chomophobic\u201d(????), but it\u2019s just a question, in no way that implies you think gay couples can\u2019t have a child??? Like, it is in fact very difficult for two men to have a child, so it makes sense you first thought it wasn\u2019t a human child???\n\ud83d\udc80 deadass, it\u2019s just something to laugh about.\nThese people are weeeeeeird.\nYou did nothing wrong.\nYou don\u2019t have to apologise, but all of you definitely need to sit down and talk it through.\nIm not neurotypical either, and i can\u2019t really understand whether it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re teasing you, i can\u2019t see the point of that, or if it\u2019s a thing.\nAnd i also don\u2019t know if them being this offended is normal(????)\nSo yeah, maybe give them your apology, and ask them what it is about that question that caused such strong feelings. I think the apology should mainly be on the lines of \u201cI\u2019m sorry i offended you, may i know why it caused such problems, so to avoid similar incidents in the future?\u201d\nWeird af \ud83d\ude10\ud83e\udee5\ud83e\udee4\ud83e\udee1", "NAH. You had a brain fart. It happens.", "NTA and it\u2019s a funny family story. It was something unexpected to you. Not even sure this would require an apology. Talk with the offended people and make sure they know how really happy you are for this baby to be in your family. Maybe go overboard with kindness.", "NAH. This is a funny situation, so thank you for the laugh.\n\nI wouldn't worry about it too much if your brother is okay with it.", "NAH - What makes me chuckle is when my parents announced they were pregnant with me, my mother\u2019s younger brother had to clarify if they meant a human child or a puppy. So it\u2019s a perfectly valid question, even if it\u2019s annoyed them a bit.", "NAH", "Nah.

However, I think it would be best to sit them down and explain that you didn't realise the process moved so quickly which is why you had that reaction, but you are absolutely thrilled for them. It would also be nice to bring them some sort of gift for baby- Google will help with ideas if they don't have a registry. Something that I like is getting bub some clothes for when they get bigger (explain that you understand that they won't fit him now, but you were hoping to avoid them getting heaps of clothes at newborn size). You could also get, or along with your gift get a pack of nappies (if they're using disposables), wipes, some formula or a gift card for delivery- practical items that they'll need, food delivery is always helpful for new, sleep-deprived parents.", "NTA\nYour family needs to get a sense of humor. It often takes a really long time to find a child to adopt. Many people start their training with cats and dogs.\nCongratulations Uncle!", "NTA. You got caught off guard and stumbled. A sincere apology should fix it.", "NTA. It\u2019s just a misunderstanding.", "NTA. But we\u2019re they also talking about getting a pet as well? If there wasn\u2019t any discussion or potential about pet talk then I can see where it would be a little dismissive to assume it. As in, oh I didn\u2019t actually think you would get a baby.

So might want to check on if that\u2019s the case.", "NTA.", "NAH I'd totes expect that Answer from a child Answer or Adult that is  Neurodiverse", "Aren't babies human puppies anyway?\nNTA, I would have laughed if I was your brother", "NAH, this is hilarious.", "Oh my days! OP! NTA! That's so funny!", "NTA but to give a little perspective - gay people (myself included) aren\u2019t really seen/accepted as parents, there\u2019s a lot of stigma still that we have to fight against, externally and internally. So your joke, while funny, may have struck a chord around a sensitive topic that I\u2019m sure bro+husband were really emotional about, adoption\u2019s a rough ride for many people let alone gay people.", "NAH because you really thought they got a pet.

OTOH, I personally wouldn't describe a pet as a 'nephew', though I know that some people do. Tbf, I'm neurodivergent too, and I know I've similarly stuck my foot into my mouth at times.

It sounds like it was a baby surrendered to a firehouse. Therefore it would have ended up in the public/or government side which is usually called the foster system. When trying to adopt you can go the private or public route but if it\u2019s the public route it would technically be through the foster system. The reason for the difference is private adoption is extremely expensive but through the foster care system often you don\u2019t pay anything. It\u2019s pretty rare (at least where I am from) to get a newborn though the government based system so when there is a child so young that was surrendered it doesn\u2019t end up in foster care but instead focused straight into adoption. Again I can\u2019t speak of everywhere and how their programs are run but where I am within the foster system there are two avenues. One is foster to adopt and the other is just to be a foster parent. I was just trying to clarify why this would happen so fast because the gut instinct of it should take longer is correct.", "Must've spelt \"dog\" wrong lol", "Mine is the same, she loves having a conversation if you are willing to keep talking to her.", "\u2026 thank you. That was enlightening", "I think the word foster is getting things confused. It\u2019s not fostering the way we typically think about it. It just that public adoptions are run through the same umbrella as the foster system. Think of it as one organization with two separate roles. People who foster to adopt are not necessary fostering at all especially if they are looking to adopt babies vs older children.", "How would you even get on the list for public adoptions? Would you not already need to be an approved foster parent?", "From what op said they were already in the process of adoption. So, again I\u2019m guessing based on the limited information I have available to me, but I would assume they decided to take the public route instead of the private. They would have already had been screened to be approved for adoption at which point they would have been placed on a waitlist. At that point it\u2019s just a waiting game of when child that would be a good fit for your family becomes available and where you are on the waitlist. Once approved to adopt it can be anywhere from the next day to years before you get a child.\n\nEdit: wanted to add that there is actually a chance OPs brother is technically fostering right now. Many foster to adopt programs require a certain amount of time before you can officially adopt the child. If that was the case I would imagine that OPs brother isn\u2019t worried about the semantics because to him this is his son whether or not it is official yet."]}
