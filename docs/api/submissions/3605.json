This is an emergency situation. \n\nHe's an adult, even if he wasn't exactly acting like one. \n\nIf you had taken the friend's son just for a visit, or so your friend could make plans, it would be different. This is for a woman who has just given birth and is watching her baby die, and doesn't have another good option for care for her living child.\n\nMy husband thinks his birthday is very important. He gets very grumpy when he doesn't feel prioritized for it. You could argue that he takes it a little too seriously (and I have). I can't imagine him complaining in this situation. Or calling me that word.\n\nAlso, this is a three year old, for a small family celebration that already involves a baby, not a grand adult dinner in a hotel that needs to be rescheduled.", "NTA. In addition to everything else people have said, you already have a young child. Having a second young child there isn't stopping you guys from celebrating. The kid's not ruining your adults only plans. You partner's birthday was already gonna be celebrated in a way that was appropriate for your own kid. The second kid adds stress, sure, but it's not like a drastic change was needed.

An emergency situation.\n\nYour husband is a 32yr old father who called you a c*nt in front of your child, I have no words because he's vile.\n\nMy husband's birthday is on Christmas Eve, does he call me a cunt or throw a tantrum like a toddler when we do Christmas things with the kids, no he puts on his big boy pants knowing full well that after Christmas we will do something special just us.\n\nAlso if my friend was going through what your friend is he be one of the first to ask if they needed anything, and to call us if they did.\n\nHonestly I don't normally say this but I think you need to throw out the husband. \n\nNTA", "So your husband thought that celebrating his birthday was more important than helping a friend whose child was literally dying in front of them????  \n\n\nNTA.  I'm a dude.  I got married and had kids young.  I gave up a lot of things at times to make that work.  My wife is amazing and has certainly taken time I would have liked to have with her to help friends who are going through crisis.  You know what my response was?  Tell me how I can help babe, their crisis is more important than my annual thing.    \n\n\nYour husband sounds shockingly selfish and hurtful.

He's 32 for crying out loud. Plan a special night the next weekend to make it up to the poor baby. Has he always been this spoiled? If so, I can see why you are having problems.

Run.", "NTA- while it\u2019s understandable that THIS birthday was more important than others for the explained reasons, your friend\u2019s daughter was DYING and he acted like a little child in spite being a grown up ass.

At the very least, you should be in serious couples counseling or individual if he refuses to go. But this is very selfish behavior on his part. It's also harder for us to make a judgment about whether to leave the marriage since this is just one of the issues (although if more of them are this serious, girl run!)", "NTA, you need to be asking yourself if this is the kind of man you want to spend your life with. You showed a mom to have the most time with her baby, who was very unlikely to survive. He is being selfish and there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t celebrate with him there. Calling you names is unacceptable. You weren\u2019t babysitting to give her a date night, she was with her dying child. He\u2019s an absolute AH and deserves to be alone.

I honestly would not want to stay married to a grown man who couldn\u2019t understand that a tragic emergency happened that impacted plans for his birthday. It was his 32nd birthday, not his 5th. Birthdays can be celebrated on a different weekend when extra kids are not around. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were planning some big adult-only event and there is no reason that birthdays can\u2019t be celebrated with an extra kid floating around.", "NTA.

Yours is more understandable but I think speaking explicitly about what it means that you have to watch your friend's child over the weekend, that you still want to do something for his birthday, etc. He is inexcusable, it's never okay to call your partner a name like that, and honestly even with the bad communication now that he knows your friend's baby has passed he shouldn't be holding a grudge.", "I don\u2019t really care if your husband is upset, you did the right thing.

Your home is both of yours and decisions that will effect both should be decided by both. I saw another comment and I have to agree yes your friends baby dying and being there for her is important but is it more important than your marriage. To your husband you\u2019re prioritizing a friend over him. If I had plans for my birthday that got changed last minute without consulting me I\u2019d be upset too.

You can't just pretend the kid doesn't exist, so you get to game 6+ hours a day, or spend every weekend camping with friends or fishing or whatever. The kid is part of your life now. Did he neglect work before you had your child? Did he neglect his other responsibilities? Being a father is now one of his responsibilities, and one that takes up thr most time, but he can still do the things he did before, in moderation. I started drawing again. I talked to my husband about it, and we worked out up to 1 hour a day of undisturbed drawing time. I don't take it, but it is there if I need or want it. He has time to play video games, or whatever he wants as well. Our kid is older now, and more independent, but still wants to spend most of his time with us. \n\n\n\nSo you're husband is selfish. And he us acting like a brat. What if your daughter gets sick around his birthday? Is he going to throw another tantrum? For marriages to work, yes you do have to show appreciation for your partner. But if someone who is close to one of you, especially one who has no support system, is currently going through the worst thing in their life, then it is disgustingly cold and callous to decide that something like a birthday should take precedence, or should warrant more than a happy birthday wish and a raincheck.\n\n\n\nI am so sorry for your friend, and I hope she has found, or is able to find peace.", "If a friend of mine was in the same situation I would not ask my husband  if it was OK for me to take care of her son because I would already know the answer and it would be yes.

It is the most harrowing and stressful experience. The babies in there are so small, so sick. At least one will have an emergency every hour, where a baby's heart or lungs stop working. Having mother close at hand is incredibly important. She can provide colostrum or kangaroo care, if baby is strong enough. Even just the sound of her voice.\n\nI think your husband, based on this post and the info you've provided above, sounds incredibly selfish. He's an adult. He should, by now, have gotten over having a big special day every single birthday. Sometimes, life is just like that. Or, y'know, just celebrate it on another day, like most people would do. I would say you maybe could have communicated with him better the severity of the situation regarding your friend and her children, but honestly, he's the one who fucked up here.\n\nBetween the navel-gazing about losing time for himself, as a parent, and calling you a cxxx (and in front of your kid, no less) and the other things you've mentioned, he should be ashamed of himself.\n\nI am so sorry for your friend also.

Unless you\u2019re just completely uneducated on childbirth, anyone should take that to mean something serious has happened, and taking a turn for the worse in that situation is BAD.

So either he would use everything you say in therapy against you, or you won't even be able to get couple's therapy because a lot of therapists cannot take abusers as their clients.", "THIS.

OP has presented a specific incident which she knows will make her look good, while acknowledging that it's a much longer-term issue but avoiding explaining the context.  She's also focusing on his unhappiness being with his birthday not being celebrated, even though she clearly failed to communicate the plan to him and doesn't seem to consider his input relevant.  \n\nI also note that he DIDN'T start a fight over it.  He was \"sulking and giving [her] the silent treatment,\" which is incredibly subjective unless she's willing to say exactly what he was doing.  Was he actively refusing to respond to questions and pretending she didn't exist?  Or just not being sufficiently bouncy and enthusiastic about the plans she made without bothering to ask him?  Because being disappointed by having plans cancelled on you without warning, even if you understand the necessity, is hardly unusual or deserving of condemnation, unless the person blows up as a result.\n\nHe didn't blow up in response.  He blew up after OP escalated the situation and decided to \"confront\" him for being \"selfish.\"  She felt entitled to do so even though she was clearly in the wrong in at least one respect.  She didn't bother to spend 30 seconds to send a text saying \"hey I need to bring friendkid home, I'll explain when you get home,\" which would have at least given him some time to prepare.  She just let him walk into the situation blind, then went on the attack when he didn't spontaneously respond how she wanted .  \n\nIf someone unilaterally cancelled plans you had made without bothering to inform you, and the first you knew about it was when you walked in on the new plans already in motion, would you be happy?  If their response to you not being happy wasn't to make any apology for the change of plans and their not telling you ahead of time, but to attack you as if you were the one who acted inappropriately, would you respond with pure sweetness and light?  Or would you get pissed?  \n\nI think OP wanted the validation of this one incident so they could feel justified in taking no responsibility for everything else wrong with the relationship.

Take care of yourself, your friend (and her partner if she has one) is going to need you a lot more than your husband will in the next bit of time. I don't want to disrespect someone you care about but *fuck* your husband for not understanding how absolutely devastating this is to your friend and for thinking that doesn't trump his 32nd birthday.\n\nEdit; and you know what, I can tell you from experience how incredibly important the time she got to spend with her daughter was for her and you helped make that happen. Honestly I'm getting a little upset but that could never be replaced for anything in the world, I can't believe a person who is blessed enough to *have* a daughter can't empathize with your friend. Literally inhuman.\n\nSecond edit: these comments are just so much, I'm happy that everyone else has their priorities straight and idk it just feels validating somehow.", "I just lost my daughter, Klover, at 20.2 weeks on 7/31/22. It's the most crushing & devastating feeling EVER. 4 months have gone by & I miss her more & more everyday. I don't have many friends around but if I did, I hoped they'd be like you. NTA, he's old enough to celebrate it a different day knowing that things could go badly & you needed to give someone else support. Please continue to be there for her.", "Imagine being 32 and having a tantrum over your wife taking care of friend\u2019s kid when she\u2019s dealing with an awful situation. Read the room, and literally grow up. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s your birthday, you\u2019re 32 it is literally just another day. He should be grateful he got to live another day and spend it with his healthy baby daughter instead of being at the hospital with a premature baby who died. \n\nNTA, he disrespected you and can\u2019t realize that his actions are an issue.", "Is he five years old and wanting balloons and a party hat? A grown-ass man whining about his birthday is not a good look. I even tease my granddaughter when she mentions her birthday six months in advance, and she's only ten.", "I mean, like someone\u2019s baby is dead and he\u2019s pissy about his birthday?", "INFO Does your husband call you names often?", "As the mum of a baby born at 27 weeks, NTA. My daughter had to have two brain surgeries before she was even a month old, we had to live in hospital housing and be an hour away from home for a month. We NEEDED the support, and can I assure you, you are doing the BEST thing for your friend. Please please keep supporting her. 23 weeks is so so early to be born and she needs to spend as much time with her little girl as possible", "What I don't get here- OP and birthday boy have an 11 month old. Any planned birthday celebrations would necessarily need to have been made with those restrictions in mind. How exactly is adding another small child (friends 2yo) to the mix 'ruining' those plans? It would have made no difference whatsoever , if you have to get a baby sitter, or plan a lunch meal rather than dinner to fit around baby's schedule, then the 2yo goes along for the ride", "His birthday \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

It only gets worse from there.", "I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re with this guy.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is the AH. Who sulks over missing out on a birthday when your SO's friend's child is dying?", "He's 32 yrs old, he doesn't need a birthday party. \n\nYour friend has a sick child, she needs a baby sitter.", "NTA. I always try and put myself in the other person\u2019s shoes and there is no reality in which my birthday would be more important than allowing a mother time with her dying baby. I don\u2019t even like babies or kids. It wouldn\u2019t matter if it was a milestone birthday either. So your husband was a big baby who called you a vile name in front of your daughter. Not ok. \n\nWhen are you going to make him your ex-husband?", "NTA \u2014 aside from my 32nd birthday being the last one before we became parents, I have no memory. I remember the completely surprise party she threw for me at 30. I remember 40 where our 8 year old blew the surprise. She had passed by my 50th\u2026 \n\nAll that said, comforting a friend who just lost a child takes precedence.

My husband would never, in a million years, put his birthday over the life of one of my friends\u2019 kids. \n\nActually, my best friend had a miscarriage at our house. It was a Monday morning and we had been hanging out Sunday night, she slept over-not unusual. Next morning, she tells both of us-separately. I cancelled clients and we rallied best we could. Trust & believe, if he acts like this about someone else\u2019s tragedy, he won\u2019t cope well with yours, either.", "Ur husband's a grown ass man I think he can set aside his birthday when a literal child is dying. I can't imagine reacting that way how selfish and evil", "your husband is lack of empathy. He should learn to save the cow. NTA", "You will be happier without him, truly", "NTA.  When you are called a c*#%, all bets are off.", "NTA and what a shame that your husband is father to ur kid lol \n\ncalled you a c\\*nt in front of ur daughter bc you didn't prioritize his bday over ur friend & her dying infant? what a great father he'll be !!!!", "Don't have the info here. Inna vacuum NTA. But this could have seriously been the straw that broke the camel's back. Honestly... If my marriage was in that type of situation that would take precedent over everything. But again I don't have any info to make that decision.", "Your husband is THIRTY years old. I get it, thats a \"thing\" I guess. But he's THIRTY. What did he expect? A cake and balloons and a big surprise party? Did he want to go to burger king and get one of those cheap paper crowns? (I have no idea if they even still do that) \n\n...and I say that as someone who did have a surprise party when I turned thirty. That was back in the Ice Age, but I didn't expect anything. Your husband sounds like a spoiled child.", "As an almost 40 year old adult, I don\u2019t even celebrate birthdays much anymore. A nice dinner with them fam is fine. A bonus kid at dinner is fine. It probably would have been good to have a more in depth conversation about what the plan would be, but his response was so far out of line his ass would be sleeping on the couch until he got his head right. \n\nIt does sound like y\u2019all have needed to figure some stuff out prior to this, but name calling like that is a  full stop. NTA", "NTA. I'm glad you were able to be there for your friend. I'm sorry your husband is a tool.", "I read your earlier comment where you said Husband saw a life coach who told him to be the best dad he had to work on being the best version of himself. Great advice. He\u2019s executing poorly by being a selfish c\u2026nvm. NTA. you made it clear that the welfare of your friend dealing with a premature birth and baby was your priority and he made a fuss over a birthday. One that he\u2019s celebrated many times but that poor baby will never get to do even once. Ugh. I\u2019m upset now. And it\u2019s all his fault. \n\nHas he improved at all since the life coach advice?", "NTA grown ups should understand that life prioritizes some things for you regardless of what day of the year it is.", "NTA. Leave him! He's a loser, why would you tolerate this?? YOU deserve someone who treats you right!", "I am sorry you married a 32 yr old toddler. \n\nNTA", "My father died unexpectedly on Thanksgiving (American).  My husband and I were married earlier that year and the Christmas after my dad died was our first Christmas together as a couple and in a new home.

If either of us had to help out a friend like this, well, of course we'd reschedule.\n\nHowever, AITA is full of examples of folks who have crazy expectations for their birthdays, like the person who dropped hints for months about an \"Instagrammable\" picnic she wanted, then ripped her partner a new one for surprising her with the picnic right after a hike at the beach, rather than giving her a chance to dress up for it.\n\nIf OP expected hubby to go all out for her birthday, than him expecting the same, or at least some more of a heads-up, wouldn't be as nuts as it sounds.  (OP sounds pretty low-key, and hubby sounds pretty nuts, so I presume this isn't the case, but it's good to recognize that different couples of different expectations.)", "I have plenty of info. Your husband is a selfish pig, regardless of what Reddit tells you.", "Seriously.  This is such a blatant \"The Iranian yogurt is not the problem\" situation that I'm baffled by how insistently people have latched onto the \"he was just throwing a tantrum about his birthday\" red herring.", "You are if you think he\u2019s NTA lmao", "A baby was dying. For crying out loud people. This is ridiculous you think anything but her friend\u2019s child dying any minute comes first.", "I agree with this. I may be wrong, but I get the sense he\u2019s a covert narcissist (based on my experience with one).", "That would kill any hope of a relationship for me.

There are so many posts about people being so controlling and demanding on their birthdays and there's always comments about how they're allowed to, it's their birthday. It really confuses me, because no one I have ever known acts like that on their birthday.", "For real. No one I know irl acts like that either on their birthday. But Reddit for some reason thinks birthdays are sacred and everyone has to do exactly what you want on your birthday.", "Yeah I'm Australian and context matters. This guy didn't intend it as a greeting (or even in any positive way). NTA", "I do not understand adults who are so unreasonable over their birthdays. If it were me, I would be okay celebrating a whole month late if that meant someone about to lose her child would get support.

I cuss like a sailor w fuck being one of my favorite words, but that word? The C word? I've only said it myself out loud like a handful of times... if my husband ever called me that we would be all the way ALL THE WAY done. And we've been together 20 years.\n\nEdit that mine is obviously a paradigm of being in the states. I know folks over in the UK use that word much more liberally.", "This! I cant understand many people that get mad about birthdays. My family always got together on a weekend and just texted or called on the day. It really doesnt matter if you dont have the day off or make plans for that day or night or another day. Once you become a certain age, it's just another day.", "This is what we tend to do. Sometimes it\u2019s the day of, sometimes it\u2019s the closest weekend. What matters is celebrating life with your loved ones.", "My sis is Dec 29, so I see where you\u2019re coming from. My bday is also July 4th so most people do shit with their families", "Could not agree more. Mine's December 23rd and I work in retail as a manager, so I work my birthday every single year on possibly THE busiest day of the year. It's a non-event every year even when I was younger and I couldn't care less. It's just a birthday. It's not a big deal. I celebrate as best as I can with my team at work by just having fun that day and not letting anything get to me, but otherwise, who cares? Grown-ass adults making such a huge fuss over their birthday (and not even a milestone one), is just bizarre."]}
