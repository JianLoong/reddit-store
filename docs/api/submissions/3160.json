What kinds of comments or judgments is he making? You say he\u2019s making decisions about your life\u2014what decisions? \n\nI\u2019m asking because as an adult and authority figure in your life, he\u2019s inevitably going to have some say. He and your mom are a unit, and presumably are parenting your little sister together, so parenting decisions are going to be made together. Questions about things that involve the logistics of time, money, etc. are going to decided together. \n\nThe only concrete thing you\u2019ve listed here is that he wants to take you on a trip and bond, which isn\u2019t necessarily a \u201cdad\u201d thing. My aunts and uncles have taken me on trips and to activities, and it wasn\u2019t because they wanted to be my parents, but because they wanted to build relationships with me that would last into adulthood. \n\nI get that you don\u2019t want a new dad. But I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re conflating \u201cdad\u201d with \u201can adult man who is involved in my life in any way beyond just being present in my mom\u2019s life.\u201d", "It doesn't really sound like he's trying to be your dad. He's just trying to bond with you as your mom's husband. You're the one putting the label of \"dad\" on it. \n\nIf you think he's a nice guy, why can't you just bond with him as your mom's husband instead of a father-figure? \n\nSoft YTA.", "I presume this man contributes to raising you, will most likely pay towards driving, uni, wedding as your mum and him will have commingled finances. \nYou say he is generally nice guy, who sounds like he cares for you, and the things you say are dad like ( like making comments about your life and choices etc) are just one aspect of being a dad. \nUnless you are gonna say no to it all, no gifts, no help for the future, you just want your mum to be financially responsible for you etc - it seems a bit churlish to have a go on the one but that irks you. Him having an opinion about you and your future.  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to be a dad to support you and care for you, can he not just be an extra person who gets to care about you without having the dad title. Not a bonus parent since you don\u2019t want that - but just another person on team you that you can bounce ideas off, who can give you their life experience, and can maybe be a friend? \n\nCause that sounds nice. Cos you have a mum and a dad already but a friend who will be honest and kind and protective and not put up with bullshit just cos they love you is worth their weight in gold", "Difficult, I've been in the same situation. I regularly silenced my stepfather when he acted like a father. I am now an adult, he is the best grandfather your child could wish for and yes, also the best father. As a pre-adolescent/teenager, your reaction is quite normal. Don't see it as an attempt to become your father, but your mother's partner, who wants to do something fun together.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nHe\u2019s been in your life for quite a while now, and like it or not, he is already a father figure in your life. You said he\u2019s a great guy & implied he made your mother happy so it\u2019s not like he\u2019s bribing you to make up for being a jerk. Refusing the trip is a slap in the face, he\u2019s just trying to have an opportunity for the two of you to find out more about each other, bonding on a step-relative level. He\u2019s not trying to replace your dad, I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s a person living in your home, time to grow up and give him a chance to be another human in your life.", "I feel like this is a bit more complicated than just what's written here... I get that you don't want another father figure. You also want your mom to be happy and accept that your stepfather makes her (and I'll assume little sister as well) happy. But the problem is that it can't be both ways. Unless they divorce, he's always going to be your stepfather and going to have that sort of presence in your life. Even if he attempts to approach things like a \"best buddies\" situation, it'll still be seen as a fatherly thing by your mother and the rest of your family. So, by all intents and purposes, unless your goal is that you just want him to ignore that you're there (which is virtually impossible with living in the same home) and go about life as if there's only one child in the house, you will never be able to avoid him and any attempts he makes to try and bond with you on any level. Again, unless they divorce, and I'd like to assume that you don't want them to do that because you know it'd make your mother and sister very unhappy.  \n\n\nEven when you're 18 and able to be on your own, it's also not going to be doable. Sure, it'll help put in some distance, you can set up boundaries to keep him out, but at the same time, you also risk pushing the parental figure that means the most to you - your mom - away. Because you'll be forcing her to pick between her child and her husband. While, yes, logistically, her child should come first, you have to know that it will absolutely destroy her that she has to choose between two of the people she loves most of all. Is this the hill you wish to die on for the rest of your life, knowing that it will likely lead to you losing the bond you have with her, your sister, and the rest of your family, instead of being willing to play nice with your stepfather? No, you don't need to accept him as a father per se, but there are ways you can have a respectful relationship that won't lead to catastrophic pain down the line. An uncle, a best buddy, just someone that you can try and trust. There has to be a way for compromises to be made in this situation to where your family can be happy as a unit. If anything, ask for family therapy to be done to where you all can sit down and discuss your feelings and such with a neutral third party, and be given the tools to help navigate this topic. Push for it hard, if they try and fight it, but I'd like to hope that they won't because they'd also like to come to a compromise with you so they don't lose you.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. I don\u2019t really get along with my stepdad. He\u2019s been with my mom since I was 3. If someone tried to get me to go on a vacation with just him I\u2019d be incredibly uncomfortable", "YTA. \n\nHe isn't your mom's new partner. He has been a father figure longer than your biological father was. You are idealizing a ghost. You have no actual memories of your father. He hasn't been your mom's new partner for the better part of a decade. \n\nI am assuming that you also reject any contributions he makes toward your gifts, college fund, activities, or other extras in your life since you are so certain he should not do anything fatherly or anything for you.", "NTA they should understand the limits of the relationship. It often happens that parents or parental figure think of what make you even happier. They totally miss the fact that you might already be happy with the situation. \nIf your stepdad is trying to become your dad which I think is really weird especially if you already had a talk with him about it\u2026\n\n\nNow the trip thing\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t ever say YTA for them surprising you and expecting you to go. I know he already booked everything but what\u2019s the point to go if you\u2019re going to be unhappy during the whole thing + you can be sure he\u2019s going to remind you of what \u00ab\u00a0he\u2019s done for you\u00a0\u00bb and that you should \u00ab listen to him now \u00bb which will make everything and the relationship trash cause that\u2019ll be straight up overpassing you\u2019re boundaries.\n\nI hope you don\u2019t go on this trip. It might disappoint your mom tho\u2026 What\u2019s more important to you ? You have to make a choice.", "very soft YTA\n\nyou're 16. you lost your dad when you were 2. you have no clear memories of that time. you're getting hung up on the idea of your \"real father\"\n\nyou're hurting your step-dad and your mother with your attitude. it's extra worse because there is nothing they can do about it. your dad died, and you never got to know him. that sucks, it really does, but you're punishing your mother for something that was way beyond anything she could have controlled.\n\nyour stepdad obviously cares about you and your mother or he wouldn't have stuck around. it takes a different quality of man to step up and raise another man's kids. most men simply won't do it. you don't have to call him \"dad\" if it bothers you that much, but that doesn't mean you can't bond with the man who raised you.", "NTA as the more someone tries to push love on you, the more creepy it feels. He needs to learn of his place and accept the fact that you don't need a dad and won't do dad things with him. You have every right to your feelings and let noone force you to want to accept something you don't want to. If he wanted to, he should have checked with you first before making any booking. Also going on a trip with someone who isn't your dad is a bit creepy when you are 16f. If he learns to accept his place, someday you might accept him as family but what he's currently doing at least in your head seems to want to take over your dad's role and its something you don't want to be filled by anyone other than your dad. Just tell your mom that you don't need a new dad and to ask her to talk to her partner to back off. Why some people never get the message is really weird.", "NTA IF AND ONLY IF  this guy does not provide for anything in your life. Like, if all the bills and all your expenses are covered by your mom. It would be hypocritical if you take his money for education, food or whatever and then behave like this to him. If he does not give a dime towards your expenses, NTA. If he does, YTA,  don't be hypocritical and cut that as well.", "YTA but that's fine. Most 16 year olds are unreasonable.", "Is anyone expecting you to call him dad ? Is it them being married or him trying to be nice abd establish a friendship that has pushed the boundaries for you? \n\nEither way, yes YTA", "YTA He has never done anything wrong and you decided you would never ever accept him through no fault of his own.  He is your stepfather whether you like it or not. Or accept it or not.  He has the right to behave in a parenting role if your mom decides he can.  If you are OK with him supporting you but not having any say in your life, you are not being reasonable.  You are saying you will never accept him and that is unreasonable.  You don\u2019t even know the man you think he is trying to replace but you have decided to idolize him.  Doesn\u2019t your mom deserve to be happy and move on with her life?  She cannot do that completely when her daughter acts like this.  She will always be in the middle.", "NTA look he wants to be your dad so bad he can't understand that he could very well have bonded and forged a dad like (but not dad) relationship with you .... If he had just respected your feelings in the first place. \n\nI don't agree with people saying you're idolizing a ghost or don't even know the man you're afraid he's trying to replace. That all feels VERY yucky to me. It feels like they're saying \"get over it, he isn't your *real* dad. Your step dad is the one who has been doing all the dad stuff so he *deserves* to be your real dad, no matter how you feel about it, OP.\" \n\nExcept that your biodad very much IS your real dad and it isn't his fault he hasn't been able to be one to you. I don't fault you for your resistance, no effort has been made to meet you half way, it seems. If he could put aside the dad thing and truly want to know you as a person and let you know him as himself, you could forge a strong bond (assuming you're compatible people I'm not saying it WILL happen just that it would allow for the potential of it to blossom whereas the path he's on now has no chance) regardless of the title of 'dad'. \n\nI get that it's important to him, but it should be important to him also to consider your feelings and what you want and how the 2 of you can live together happily/successfully rather than how he can convince you to see it his way.", "First of all, I'd get it if you'd say that you don't want somebody to 'replace' your father. But that does not seem to be the case, or at least you are saying that you don't actually have any memories of your father.\n\nI'd also get it if you'd say that you want to separate your relationship to your stepdad from your mom's relationship to her husband. Valid poit. Absolutely understandable. Maybe a little less so given the fact that he is not just some guy your mother just met, but anyway...\n\nWhat I don't get is that there is a man in your (and your mom's) live who tries to make an effort to be a father to you, and you keep pushing him away. He is not just your mother's boyfriend. They are married, which makes him family, like it or not. And you said yourself that he is a nice guy and you actually like him. You have known him half your life. I'm gonna assume that he at least partly pays for the roof above your head and the food on your table. He *is* your stepdad in every way you look at it, except in your head. Your refusal is so stereotypical teenage, it'd be almost comical if it wasn't so sad. You almost make it sound as if him wanting to bond with you was somehow part of some evil masterplan. I really have no idea what you are afraid of. But hopefully you can find a way to accept the fact that you are loved by someone who is not your biological father before that love goes away.  NAH", "NTA I was you and now I\u2019m NC with a lot of family, they aren\u2019t respecting how you feel and are trying to force things on you, that\u2019s selfish on their part. He has no right to assume the dad role unless you are comfortable with it!", "Definitely not the asshole. My stepdad never tried to be my dad, he was always a good friend instead. He never told me what I could or couldn't do and if I asked him he always deferred to my mom... Since he's not my dad. And it isn't that he didn't want to be my dad, he just understood what I wanted our relationship to be. \n\nI'm so sorry you are going through this. Definitely not the asshole for choosing to not go on a trip that was surprised on you. That's a bribe, you have a right to refuse it. Stay strong but perhaps try and do some other activities with him if you can create solid boundaries.", "YTA - he's trying to build a bond with you because you are your mother's child. He isn't trying to be dad but he does want what's best for you. \n\nYou will lose a chance at a normal relationship not with dad but with a father figure. Just because you don't want to accept him as Dad doesn't mean you should reject him outright. \n\nYou are 16 and by God my step dad is my angel. My father on the other hand I have no relationship with him. \n\nHe doesn't have to be dad to be an adult you can trust and depend on", "Soft YTA", "YTA mostly to yourself, but also to your mom and stepfather. It's clear you are working through some issues, and I am so sorry you are dealing with these big emotions. Your mom didn't replace your father - from what you've shared, it looks like your mom grieved, eventually found someone else she wanted to be with, and started a life with this person. Who you are now punishing because he isn't the father that you probably don't have any memories of at all. Not that you can't have strong feelings for someone you never met, especially your deceased father. But you are not being fair to a person who has been in your life for half of it, and you haven't said anything about him mistreating you. \n\nYou should consider talking to someone. Therapy may help you sort through why you are behaving like this.", "You are still grieving. You are not an AH but neither is your mom or SD. It\u2019s been a few years since you lost your dad but grief knows no timeframe. You need to find a way to heal though. You are only hurting yourself in the end. Your SD will never replace your dad but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t try to develop a different kind of relationship. You could be missing out on something good. NAH", "YTA. It's interesting that you still refer to your mother's husband as a partner, implying that the relationship is somehow a temporary arrangement that will pass of you hold out long enough. You don't know how lucky you are to have a stepfather making the effort to connect with you. Rather than thinking of a stepfather as just some stranger trying to tell you what to do, consider that you now have another adult who is willing to give you time and attention.", "NTA and I find it incredibly creepy he booked a trip for just the 2 of u!", "Really really soft YTA, just think about you having a bf or gf, they are your focus right, but you understand and accept that they have friends and family and in an ideal world you would like to get on with them. It\u2019s not because you have an ulterior motive or want to be play a different role to the one you have you just want to make time and relationships with the people who are important to the person you love. I think your stepfather might be the same, its very likely that he has no illusion about becoming a replacement Father but just wants a good relationship with you. \n\nYou are not betraying your Dad or your relationship with him if you form a bond with your Stepdad just being a normal part of the family your Mum has built.

Amazing how people call them AH\u2019s when kids act more grown up than the adults around them.\n\nAlso I suspect from your belaboring the fact you accept your mother has a right to move on and be happy romantically that you\u2019re being accused of not accepting him as a dad out of jealousy. If that\u2019s the case, stick to your guns and tune out the noisy people who lack the imagination to actually empathize with someone.", "NTA. It\u2019s your choice good or bad, right or wrong.

Be honest and communicate that to him and your mom.

If he's a nice guy, what's emotionally getting in the way?\n\nYou've said several times that you would be willing to bond with him if he stopped doing certain things against your boundaries, but the only concrete example I can see of him overstepping is him booking you a weekend away together without your agreement, which was a big step too far for him, as clearly you guys aren't ready for that yet. The other examples such as \"commenting on your behaviour\" could just be making inputs which would be expected of any protective adult like an uncle or close family friend who lives with a child. Unless he's criticising or shaming you, it's not wrong for him to give you advice or try to enforce boundaries if your behaviour is out of line. Yeah it's probably really annoying and may feel uncomfortable to you, but it's also what adult family members who love you are supposed to do. It's not realistic for someone who helped raise you to never comment or try to guide any part of your life ever and he's not overstepping if he does. He's not a stranger with no right to comment, he's someone who helped raise you for 8 years. Why does that feel so uncomfortable to you?\n\nI'm going to gently suggest that unless there's clear examples of boundary overstepping you've not told us, you interpreting his actions as overstepping and \"acting like a dad\" is more about your unaddressed feelings around him replacing your dad or taking credit for the role your mom has played for you, than him ACTUALLY trying to replace your father or being inappropriate.

Again, NAH for that, but please do recognise that if you continue as you are, its just a net loss for you in the long run. You both have everything to gain by talking this out.

This is is just going to lead to her not talking to him when she moves out.", "\u201cWhether you like it or not\u201d \u201cYou have no authority because you arent an adult\u201d god you\u2019re fucking draining. If she doesnt see him as a father and sees him just as her mother\u2019s partner then oh fucking well. She already said she never wanted a new father figure, so she wont see him as such.", "I\u2019m pretty sure in the comments or the post they said that they don\u2019t want to be included on vacations, I actually think that\u2019s where the issue started, he\u2019s trying to force OP to go on a vacation I think.", "I think you may have solved this puzzle.", "Sorry to say this but your dad doesn\u2019t give a shit about your feelings\u2026.", "You're not even listening to what the commenters are saying. You've clearly made up your mind, and it feels like you made this post SIMPLY for the reddit world to agree with you..... the vast majority of us think you're wrong.", "So you don\u2019t want your mom to have help raising a kid. Like your feelings are valid but you\u2019re definitely an AH about those whole thing. And it\u2019s weird.", "You sound like a brat. Your 16 you don\u2019t know what your mom does and doesn\u2019t pay for unless you happen to also be her book keeper. While I\u2019m not trying to diminish what your mom does for you but why don\u2019t you look at what he\u2019s done to give you the life you have now. Trust me if you where in a single income household your life would be much different. I can only judge you from your comments and your story but I really hope one day you need his help and he tells you to get stuffed it would be the sweetest karma.", "Your feelings are real.  You're allowed to feel them.  \n\nhowever, you're not identifying them.  You're still angry that you have to share your mom, and you really should see someone about that.\n\neverything I've read with your replies points to that. It has very little to do with him \"trying to be your dad\".  You're still that 8 year old child with respect to this. \n\nI hope you find peace, whatever it may be.", "Based on your post your mom and step dad have been together for 8 years. You were alone with your mom for the six years before that....", "6 years 8 years ago\u2026someone sounds like they are emotionally stunted and needs to get over themselves. Let me guess, he has the audacity to tell you you can\u2019t stay out late and have to eat you vegetables. The horror!", "See, this bizarre and clinical example you use illustrates exactly the problem with this attitude and a lot of the YTA judgements. The assumption that being an adult automatically means your feelings are more worthy of respect than a child's feelings, or that you are superior in some hierarchy and get to dictate how people interact with you. \n\nParental family bonds based on love and care for goodness sake, not a contractual employee relationship based on a boss ordering someone to do their bidding. And no, marrying in to a family doesn't grant you automatic \"boss\" status over stepkids. That title is earnt and can be complex.\n\nThe only thing she \"needs\" to do is be civil to him, and him to her, and she should respect him if he respects her. It's sad if he wants a form of closeness with her she doesn't want in return, but she's under no obligation to see him as her father. I hope they can work things out as daughter and a supportive male adult figure.", "Jesus you sound exhausting", "People are better off from being \"forced\" into accepting love and what  \"love\" is from one person isn't the same to another. Everyone is different  but you cannot force love onto someone and make them accept it just because the other person really wants to one sidedly. Love is two ways and *both* have to want it. Op does not, and people should respect that. \n\nLike what do you want op to do? Accept it just because other people say so? Just because it's there even if she doesn't want it but for some reason other peoples opinion on her heart is more important? No. That is not healthy and not the way to start any relationships and not a good mentality in general."]}
