She\u2019s undergoing chemo and ended up losing her hair, which was obviously really hard on her. His peers are starting to get to that age where they\u2019re absorbed with appearances, and have decided that everyone needs to fit into a norm. A few people made some less than kind comments about her and how she looks without hair. Theo came home last week and told me he wanted to shave his head. I made him think it over a bit to make sure it\u2019s what he wanted because he\u2019d been pretty attached to over the past several months and had been growing it out. He was adamant that he was certain it was what he wanted, and my husband shaved his head for him last night. That was possibly the happiest I\u2019ve ever seen him. I asked him if he would miss his hair, and he told me (still grinning ear to ear) that he didn\u2019t care what his hair looked like, it would grow back and it made his friend happy. He facetimed his friend afterwards to show her and it was just incredibly sweet. Today I got a call from his teacher that a couple of students had been pestering Theo about his hair, even after he explained that he did it for his friend. She tried to claim that Theo\u2019s hair was distracting the other students, and that she was giving him permission to wear hats to school (usually against dress code). I told her that he would not be wearing a hat, and diminishing the entire sentiment behind him shaving his head. just because his classmates are being brats and that if she really thought that he was the problem, she was being ignorant.", "created_utc": 1674786767, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m9sdq/aita_for_calling_my_sons_teacher_ignorant/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd email the principal and say that this teacher isn't handling a bullying problem and instead is tryijg to shift blame to the victims.", "NTA wasn\u2019t the point of him shaving his head to distract the other students from the girl with cancer?  And why is the teacher not addressing the bullying? And in 2023 how do teens not know that people with cancer lose their hair?!", "NTA. His teacher should be calling THEIR parents about THEIR behavior and not you. I hope the teacher was just as observant about them bullying theos friend, as she is about theos haircuts.", "NTA. You are raising a great kid who is on track to become an amazing man. That teacher needs to learn how to manage a classroom more effectively.", "NTA and remind your son what a great friend/person he is.", "NTA - If she really thought it was a problem, she'd speak with the bullies or their parents instead of shifting blame onto the victim.", "NTA and if all 13 year olds were as kind and thoughtful as your son, the world would be a much better place. There would probably be a LOT less teenage suicides too.", "NTA. You're raising an empathic and amazing young man. Great job!\n\nThe teacher is victim blaming and taking the bully brats sides. Handle the other kids, not Theo. She is an AH.\n\nI hope Theo's friend will recover! Theo and her may be friends for life after this. Good job with your child-raising. You're doing great!", "That teacher is TA, calling another child out for doing something for their friend WTH. Sad that they are teaching our youth", "NTA! The teacher knew his classmates were pestering him? His shaved head was distracting? Isn\u2019t it her job to know how to deal with children? This sounds a lot like victim blaming. \n\nShe should be calling the parents of these other students, telling them that their children are bullying another student who shaved his head to show support for another child who has cancer! Tell them that their children are causing a distraction and if it doesn\u2019t stop, they will be punished accordingly. \n\nThis is ridiculous! Is this teacher\u2019s lack of action also the reason the child going though chemo is getting bullied?\n\nNTA a million times, and you should be proud of yourself for raising such a thoughtful kid.", "INFO - did the teacher instruct your son to start wearing hats, or just give him the option?", "Wow NTA. Even if the teacher was gentle about how she framed it, you\u2019re right that your son isn\u2019t the problem. Sounds like she can\u2019t get the class under control and is trying to pressure you and your son into not rocking the boat for the sake of the kids misbehaving. \n\nAnd in case it needs said, HUGE kudos to you, your husband, and son for supporting a little girl and her family through an awful, awful time. You all deserve as much kindness as you share with others!", "NTA....not catering to people who *are* TA doesn't make you one", "NTA although I'd say you were being easy on the teacher for calling her ignorant. She should, you know control the classroom like in her job description and stop the kids from teasing him and her.\n\nAlso well done on raising a great kid.", "NTA\n\nBravo. You handled that way more kindly than I would have.", "Nope NTA. Wow on the teacher's part. Trying to blame the \"victim\" and not setting the bullies straight. Your kid sounds like an amazing little boy.", "NTA: why are people still so convinced that we are responsible for how someone reacts to how we look? Why can't these kids be responsible for their own behavior?", "NTA\n\nThe teacher should be contacting you to commend your son's support of his classmate and assure you that the AHs that were being disruptive have been dealt with.", "NTA.  The teacher is ignoring the bullying going on in her classroom.  This is something I think you should take to the principal.  **No, his classmates aren't being brats they're being bullies and she's letting them get away with it.**\n\n\"Rather than calling the children who are bullying my son and his friend about their hair's parents she chose to call me.  She claimed that Theo's bald head was a \"distraction\" and wants him to wear a hat, instead of addressing the behavior of the students harassing my son and the student in his class who has brain cancer.  I'm questioning her fitness for the classroom as a result.\"", "Not the asshole, but not as tactful as I would be. Is she ignorant? Meh, I\u2019d say her priorities are fucked up. Is she an asshole? Yes.\n\nWill calling her those things goad her into retaliating against your son or that girl? I don\u2019t know", "NTA\n\nThe teacher was trying to blame the victim, rather than disciplining the brats who were pestering your son. She WAS being ignorant - and lazy, too. You should talk to the school's administration about this.", "NAH\n\nWell, except for the other students. Really, teacher overstepped a tad much, but nothing wrong with clearing it by you to be corrected.\n\n\\[Edit:\\] I'll go a bit further: You yourself had some concern as well. \"I made him think it over a bit\". It would not be wrong to say that your son took a risk and a hardship, and you wanted to make sure it was an informed decision. Which is to say, your son is able to voluntarily make a hard bed for himself and become a better and stronger person for it. His teacher did not see the effort you and your son took to make that decision and may not necessarily know that he is ready for that. So that is why I think her error was a relatively minor one.", "NTA \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So maybe the teacher was letting OP know that Theo could wear a hat, too, if he liked. \n\nAny teacher who has been in the classroom for a while knows that any time a kid makes a dramatic hairstyle change, it causes a distraction for a day or two, and you just roll with it."]}
