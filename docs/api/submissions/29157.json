{"id": 29157, "submission_id": "17acl9r", "title": "AITA for telling my friends boyfriend that I\u2019m not his dead sister?", "selftext": "I know how it sounds but let me explain.\n\n So I\u2019ve known my friend Mary for a very long time, and a couple years ago she got a boyfriend. It was pretty sudden sense she had only met him a couple days before hand and she was introducing him to her parents and all of her friends. He also lives 5 hours away. When I met him I had a weird feeling but I just ignored it because I trusted her judgment. \n\nA couple months later the three of us were hanging out when Mary asked if her bf, let\u2019s call him Mat, could come over stay with me while she goes to an appointment the next day. Because he would just be by himself with her parents. I said it was fine and it went by with no complications. She however continued to ask me if he could come over more and more until eventually he would text me every time she would go to work or school or anything else really. \n\nEventually, I started to get a little weirded out. Especially after he started talking to me about his late sister Kat. She died when he was very young. From what I could get, her and I were born in the same year, brown hair, eyes, and he says we look alike. I pointed out that those are common traits and that he shouldn\u2019t compare us. And that he was my friends bf, not my brother. But he only insisted that he was my brother now sense even though I was alive when she died, I had to be his sister. \n\nThat\u2019s when he started buying me things, at first it was small but they grew and grew until I had to beg him to stop getting me things. He would also tell my younger sister that he was her brother too and she ended up putting him in her school family tree assignment because of it and he would bring that up every time I asked him to stop hugging me or cuddling me.\n\nOne time he even came into my house very early in the morning and laid in my sheets with me while I slept and watched something on my tv. When I woke up I wanted to kick him out but he apologized and he said he wouldn\u2019t do it again and I knew Mary would get upset if I did that. \n\nBut things changed when Mary told me he cheated on her. When that happened I finally had a reason to stop letting him come over and I took it. When it first happened he said he was cutting me off, which I never responded too. But then he sent me a long text saying that I was a terrible person, that he regretted buying me anything, and that he just wanted to be a good brother to me. I texted Mary and she said she\u2019s staying with him and I asked her if that was really what she wanted. And she said yes, so I then asked her if she can tell him not to text me anymore and that whatever he\u2019s done is on him. \n\nBut he texted me saying to keep her out of it and that this is between him and I. And that I always treated him terribly. I told him to stop texting me and that I thought I made it clear that he was Mary\u2019s boyfriend first always. \n\nBut recently, I\u2019ve been doubting myself. Everyone I talk to says he\u2019s in the wrong but Mary won\u2019t talk to me still. So Am I The Asshole?\n\nEdit: -just some more info-\n\nMary started dating Mat when she was 17 and he was 21. I was 18 at the time and now I\u2019m 20. \n\nAnd Mat got into my place because my mom is prone to not locking the door behind her. I have talked to her and she locks it every time now. \n\nAlso thank you everyone so much for your concern, I blocked him after I told him to stop texting me. And I hope he doesn\u2019t do anything. I must admit I was nervous about my safety as well, but I hope that as long as I don\u2019t go around Mary I should be ok.", "created_utc": 1697586889, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17acl9r/aita_for_telling_my_friends_boyfriend_that_im_not/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
