OMG people eat rabbit, crow (birds, no kidding), dogs, horse, crickets, and everything else under the sun worldwide.\n\nYour friend was just too sheltered and \"touchy\" to take a mature view of the situation. It is not anyone else's place to judge.", "NTA. Rabbit is a common food in poorer communities. Fills you up quickly without needing to eat much.
