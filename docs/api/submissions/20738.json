I hate this idea that we have to accept that the person's feeling were hurt. She doesn't get to feel hurt here. Your friend is ignorant to the world around her. People have been eating rabbit for centuries. It's not a new thing. People are way to sensitive. You didn't double down. You eat the shit you like to eat.", "NTA...You didn't know about her pet.  People love to make categories of animals that are okay as meat, and those that are not.  They need to accept that this is their own mental boundary and that other people eat all manner of meat.", "NTA\n\nRabbit is commonly eaten in many cuisines, and quite frankly, your friend was being a baby here.", "NTA. However, were you aware that she had lost a pet rabbit recently?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know her rabbit died, and her getting triggered was her problem. While we are all the main characters in our own stories, in this case your friend seems to have forgotten she isn\u2019t the main character in other people\u2019s stories.", "Nta, and it sounds like she was being micro aggressive with you.", "NTA\n\nIt's not as if you knew and were intentionally rubbing it in her face. You were just eating something that's a normal dish in your culture. If she didn't want to be near it, she should have moved away. And it seems like she was more upset you were sharing it which is just weird.", "NTA.  Friend has trauma to deal with, but that doesn't justify her behavior toward you.  I have trauma around rabbit meat (dad raised them, sis and I blundered our way into a butchering, all manner of fun ensued) and I would have been in internal freakout mode in this situation.  I still understand it's not my place to criticize anyone else's food preferences.  Seems like friend still has somematuring to do.", "NTA. \n\nLike you noted your friend was upset about the death of her rabbit. I think she didn\u2019t like how the conversation evolved as she didn\u2019t feel her feelings of sadness was validated. \n\nGuess she would have liked a \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that is so sad\u201d (then no more talk about eating rabbits as a sign of respect for her feelings\u2026 change of topic)\n\nBut instead she got more talk about the dish. \n\nShe is valid in her feelings. You might have handled the situation better but you are NTA.", "NTA Just because she lost her pet rabbit doesn't mean she's entitled to tell everyone else what they can and can't eat.", "I'm vegan. The way I see it, either you're against all meat, or you're ok with all meat, or you're a hypocrite. NTA", "NTA - what you did is completely normal & if your friend is a meat eater and only cares because it was a rabbit, that\u2019s completely illogical and an embarrassing distinction for her to make", "YTA - She can be upset about her pet rabbit being dead, you don't get to control that.

It's pretty clear from context that I meant non-human meat. \n\nMany vegans, including myself, believe that humans have an inherent right to life, which would make human meat unethical, barring gray area where, say, eating a human's corpse is necessary for survival. \n\nSome vegans believe that animals do not have a right to life per se, but do believe that animal lives should be considered valuable enough that meat is immoral, whether it comes from a cute pet animal or a farm animal. \n\nSome vegans believe that animals also possess some form of right to life, but within that camp there is debate whether there is a hierarchy of such rights to life.\n\nThere would also be ethical systems that do not place a right to life nor any ethical weight to any non-human animal, in which case all non-human meat would be morally permissible. \n\nEither way, it is clearly a double standard to be outraged about animal abuse towards rabbits but not towards pigs or cows.", "yup, this right here. \n\nBut I mostly get mine from my grandparents since they raise rabbits", "I mean yours was a peak Vegan comment.

Or eat a nice bacon sandwich if a pet micropig went to that blissful forever sleep?\n\nAs the vegan you're replying to stated - its either all, none, or hypocrisy\n\nIn the UK vegetarians/vegans actually had a really good argument when a chain frozen store was found to substitute large amounts of expensive beef for cheaper horse meat - British culture horses are working/sporting/pet animals not food animals, so loads of people got outraged...vegans and vegetarians rightfully pointed out \"be mad at the fraud sure, but do you not see the issue with drawing some weird line of which animals are acceptable food and which aren't. Either it's fair game to take anything from a rabbit to a dog to a pigeon and throw it in a stew or none of its OK, not this weird 'OK these like 12 bird species, 20 mammals, and 10 seacreatures are cool but nothing else\"", "Well my bad for using my worldview to judge OP NTA, the thing that this sub exists for, right?", "OK I forgot to tag NTA in my original comment.
