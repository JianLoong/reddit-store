So if you want a few answers about breatsfeeding here they are:   \n\n\nShe should take advantage of being still in pregnancy and do some simple exercises on her breast. Purchase a slightly rough bath sponge and advise her to gently dry rub it around the areola. This will help strengthen the skin and desensitize the nipple until the day of birth. Encourage her to do this whenever she can, and it should be something comfortable. After that, she should apply almond oil to moisturize. **This is just a pre-birth exercise.**\r  \n\r  \nHere are some things to know afterward. The first milk that comes out is very yellow. It's necessary for her to breastfeed in a comfortable position (for example, my baby only latched on when I lay in bed. Before that, it was a struggle because I was always sitting). Don't let the baby fall asleep while nursing, as they might end up chewing on the nipple, and that can be painful later. Also, make sure not to let milk flow into the baby's ear, as it can lead to ear infections. Always keep a clean towel nearby.   \n\n\nIf you need to ask more, DM me, ok?

You\u2019re not TA for not making it a point to tell her (that\u2019s a weird thing to bring up unprompted) and absolutely not the AH for going the formula route. \n\nWhile there is evidence that breastfeeding has more nutrients and \u201cbenefits\u201d than formula for the duration of consumption, there is no evidence to support that long-term, breastfed babies have any advantage over formula fed babies. (Ie if you\u2019re sick you would pass on the antibodies to your baby, where as with formula your baby wouldn\u2019t get them. ) \n\nArguably, your daughter got benefits from you formula feeding that potentially affected her future:\n\n1. You were able to bring in an income, so she grew up with a socio economic advantage over babies who grew up in poverty.\n2. You had less anxiety and stress - which means you were able to be a more present and calm parent\n3. You reduced the risk of her getting sick from spoiled milk because you would have had to pump at work - which allows room for error/milk going bad. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your daughter is mom shaming you. I hope her doctor will set her straight.", "NTA. I wouldn't say this is something that comes up in conversation.

In fact, the reason my mum switched to formula was because I kept losing weight and became malnourished. I never knew about this all until I got pregnant myself and the topic came up.

It sucks for the parent and for those around them.", "NTA. I don't know why your daughter thinks that formula isn't adequate and that she's malnourished, but that's obviously not the case.

Calm yourself.", "Breast feeding isn't the bizarre, self-important thing. Shitting on other parents is.", "*Feeding* your kid should be encouraged.

His digestive tract wasn\u2019t fully developed yet and all he could handle was soy formula. Trying to breastfeed him would have made him less healthy, not more.

Then the doctor came by and she said \u201che\u2019s hungry!

In the normal course of conversation, when would this have come up?  \n\nI had some medical issues as an infant that required me to stay in the hospital for several days,  and in the hospital, I was bottle fed.  Everybody just recommended that my mom continue formula in a bottle at home, so that's what she did.  I only know this because when my aunt gave birth to one of my younger cousins, there was a similar situation, but my aunt got a lot of help and good advice about how to transition the baby to breastfeeding and augment with pumping.

They explained that if I *could* express and provide breast milk for her, it would be a great help towards building up her nonexistent immune system. When she was actually hungry, they gave her formula - and the formula was amazing for her weight gain, which was one of the biggest milestones required by the NICU for her release from hospital.", "Preventing SIDS is one of those advantages\u2026 and of course it evens out by that time. They\u2019re not infants anymore.", "That honestly depends on the generation (and maybe location). When my mother had my siblings and me (mid and end 90s) she was heavily critised for breastfeeding because 'formula is much better and has more nutrition'. She herself (mid 60s) was bottle fed because at that time formula was all the new rage and breastfeeding was considered really dirty and gross.\n\nNowadays we should really stop pushing one or the other.\nIf someone wants and can breastfeed then that's great. If they can't then there are great alternatives these days.", "Well that made me laugh, and I appreciate you for brightening my day.", "Audit the milk!", "Angry upvote", "I laughed. Take my upvote, you filthy bastard!", "Generally breast milk is the most safe food for preemies, soy formula was probably used because there wasn\u2019t any donor milk available.", "The midwives were being irresponsible. Babies have died from attitudes like theirs. I\u2019m so glad your doctor was sensible.", "Which makes so much sense, because stress and lack of sleep are contributors to low milk production. Continuing to try and *only* breast feed and neglecting your own welfare would just make the lack of milk problem worse. Not to mention the whole 'neglect your own welfare' part of that situation!", "> Breastfeeding is just the biological norm\n\nDeath is the biological norm; this is why historically, the wealthy used wet nurses, etc. The push towards formula in the 20th century was part of the major reduction in child mortality. Then over time, marketing by formula makers in conjunction with more woman working out of the home pushed formula as more convenient than breast feeding. Hospitals in the US use to give out newborn bundles that they got from formula companies which included a branded bag, diapers, a bunch of formula and coupons for more formula. This also got tied into the classist assumptions people made about parents.\n\nThe resurgence of breast feeding and the marketing around that was about getting formula companies out of the maternity ward. But now it has swung so far in the other direction where people are often shamed if they use formula. What we really need is to push the \"fed is best\" message with a plethora of options so new parents feel supported to make the decision that works best for their family. As an aside, part of the WHO message about supporting breast feeding is aimed at people who live in areas where unsafe water makes formula unsafe.", "I mean true but I feel like that\u2019s less common if they weren\u2019t raised by an asshole. Not impossible, just less common\n\nOr at least I hope", "I really dislike the whole \"exclusively breastfed\" term because some people think that means it's all or nothing - even having one little formula bottle ONCE means you are not exclusively breastfed, so it doesn't surprise me it's just 1% - a lot of moms would like to breastfeed but \"can't make enough\" so switch to formula exclusively, I thought that was the case until I had a friend who happily did 50/50 with her babies for the first year or two.\n\nside note: I never realized how much people liked to shame/know how you are feeding your infants until I was pregnant because holy moly it's a hot topic of conversation!!\n\nmy 3 kids have had RTF formula, expressed breastmilk fortified with extra calories, powdered formula, donated breastmilk, breastmilk via feeding tube, bottles of all of the above, and nursed directly - whatever works best for your kiddos and you\n\nI also have been mom-shamed for most, if not all, of the above choices.. you really can't win in these mommy groups!!", "This was regarding the US. 56% are still breastfeeding at 6 months though most are not exclusive.", "On WIC in 2000, I was actively discouraged from longterm breastfeeding.
