So if you want a few answers about breatsfeeding here they are:   \n\n\nShe should take advantage of being still in pregnancy and do some simple exercises on her breast. Purchase a slightly rough bath sponge and advise her to gently dry rub it around the areola. This will help strengthen the skin and desensitize the nipple until the day of birth. Encourage her to do this whenever she can, and it should be something comfortable. After that, she should apply almond oil to moisturize. **This is just a pre-birth exercise.**\r  \n\r  \nHere are some things to know afterward. The first milk that comes out is very yellow. It's necessary for her to breastfeed in a comfortable position (for example, my baby only latched on when I lay in bed. Before that, it was a struggle because I was always sitting). Don't let the baby fall asleep while nursing, as they might end up chewing on the nipple, and that can be painful later. Also, make sure not to let milk flow into the baby's ear, as it can lead to ear infections. Always keep a clean towel nearby.   \n\n\nIf you need to ask more, DM me, ok?

You\u2019re not TA for not making it a point to tell her (that\u2019s a weird thing to bring up unprompted) and absolutely not the AH for going the formula route. \n\nWhile there is evidence that breastfeeding has more nutrients and \u201cbenefits\u201d than formula for the duration of consumption, there is no evidence to support that long-term, breastfed babies have any advantage over formula fed babies. (Ie if you\u2019re sick you would pass on the antibodies to your baby, where as with formula your baby wouldn\u2019t get them. ) \n\nArguably, your daughter got benefits from you formula feeding that potentially affected her future:\n\n1. You were able to bring in an income, so she grew up with a socio economic advantage over babies who grew up in poverty.\n2. You had less anxiety and stress - which means you were able to be a more present and calm parent\n3. You reduced the risk of her getting sick from spoiled milk because you would have had to pump at work - which allows room for error/milk going bad. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your daughter is mom shaming you. I hope her doctor will set her straight.", "NTA. I wouldn't say this is something that comes up in conversation.

In fact, the reason my mum switched to formula was because I kept losing weight and became malnourished. I never knew about this all until I got pregnant myself and the topic came up.

It sucks for the parent and for those around them.", "NTA. I don't know why your daughter thinks that formula isn't adequate and that she's malnourished, but that's obviously not the case.

I know someone who was struggling with breastfeeding due to an autoimmune disorder. A paediatrician told her that she \u201cdidn\u2019t love her child enough, that\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t producing enough milk\u201d. Just the thought of something like that boils my blood.

There\u2019s a lot of human made solutions for everything so why is it that everything is okay but women must stick to \u201cthe natural thing\u201d.\n\nIn fact, having the ability to feed formula is a privilege. When we think that more than 50% of the human population cannot use formula either due to accessibility issues or prohibitive costs, the people who can should really be happy about it.\n\nHaving a newborn is hard enough without the added guilt of not breastfeeding if you physically can\u2019t or just don\u2019t want to.", "Seriously", "There is not, in fact, a significant difference. In fact, there\u2019s barely any difference at all.\n\nMany studies have shown over the years that breastfed children are healthier, smarter, do better in school, etc. Unfortunately, these studies have influenced public opinion and public health policy globally. I say it\u2019s unfortunate because you cannot directly study the effects of breastfeeding in a scientific setting, it would be beyond unethical. So these studies are simply tracking the progress of breastfed vs formula fed babies over time. But it turns out, breastfeeding and better outcomes is a correlation, not a causation. Mothers who breastfed were much more likely to be better educated and of higher socioeconomic status and in a 2 parent household. Like OP, single mothers and those who have to work have a very hard time breastfeeding and most end up needing to formula feed.

Her pediatrician also always encourages me to keep giving her whatever small amount of milk I can even though I kinda told her I want to stop (love that guilt lol). I will say that in the NICU, I didn\u2019t feel supported in putting my baby to the breast (but I\u2019ve seen other NICU moms of all races say the same\u2014they bottle feed there and push pumping more so than breastfeeding). \n\nThat said, I can imagine that the messaging is more forceful with white women.

When mom can\u2019t bring herself to get out of bed because her PPD is being amplified by being the only person who can feed (and in many cases, soothe) her child? When mom kills herself because she\u2019s failing to do what society pressures her into? \n\nDoes breast stay best throughout all those things? Or is it possible that in those situations the risk of a couple more ear infections per year is worth the financial price of formula, which is (in my professional opinion) the biggest con of formula?

You also lose the ability to be an active participant in your birthing process when you have a c-section.

I hadn't been producing much and mastitis plus surgery meant I dropped down to 25 ml expressed. The lovely lactation consultant midwife sat me down and said she knew I tried my best but I'd done enough and I should stop breastfeeding and focus on getting well.

I was away from her 10-12 hours a day, with no time to pump(yes my employer was \"legally required\" to allow them but that means nothing if there's nowhere to pump and taking into account we had to stay with adult:child ratio). WIC lady acted like I \"just wasn't trying\". I felt so bad. I killed myself pumping all night long to try and keep up supply, even though my baby slept all night.
