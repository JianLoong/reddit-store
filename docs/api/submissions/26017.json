She sounds misinformed.", "NTA\n\nMy guess: your daughter has been talking about how superior breast feeding is and how much she thrived under it to her circle of friends. I'd guess she probably also judged one or more other moms for not doing it. Now that she knows the truth, she's upset because she built her self-image around it. She probably accused other people of \"malnourishing\" their kids with formula. It's a whole thing people do for some bizzare, self-important reason.", "Sounds like your daughter is reading into too many things and taking them for gospel (the fact she's booking a Dr to see if she is disadvantaged is quite obsessive tbh) \n\nNTA it's not something that comes up nor does it matter. \n\n\nSounds like daughter might be trying to be a text book parent here and will end up burning herself out.", "NTA, and good lord she needs to grow up or get over herself or something. How insufferable. Many babies weren't breastfed and they turned out just fine. I wonder what she would think if she realized there is a whole generation of babies fed Carnation Milk out of a can LOL. Is she also the type who says that her baby will never eat a french fry, or a goldfish cracker because they are unhealthy? Wait a few years and she might get knocked down a peg or two by her own experience. Or she will push everyone around her away with her drama and antics, one or the other.", "NTA. Breastfeeding may have health benefits for the baby, but it's not a reasonable or workable option for many women for a variety of reasons. It also isn't the kind of thing likely to come up in conversation, or to be thought about years later.  \n\n\nThere have been more people aggressively pushing it (as others here have already said) which might be inflating its importance in her mind.  \n\n\nIn any event, it's clear that you didn't hide it; you answered truthfully as soon as she asked.", "NTA. I don't know if I was breastfed either, I just never asked and it's not something I would expect my mom to just bring up out of the blue.\n\n\nEven if she *had* been malnourished, that's 24 years ago. It's her state *now* that matters.", "NTA Does your daughter blame her own unreasonableness on the fact she was not breastfed?", "NTA. I feel really sad for you that she took it in this direction and questioned your parenting. She is indeed being ridiculous and I'm sure her doctor will assuage her concerns. Does she think having been breastfed as an infant relates to your ability to breastfeed your child when you're an adult? In 2000, in the US, something like 1 in 3 babies were not breastfed - she's not in an extreme minority or in a group of people whose health has to be specially tracked. \n\nIs she generally like this, overreactive and prone to 'victimhood'? Or maybe this is stemming just from her anxiety and hormones from pregnancy? \n\nI hope she cools off and apologizes for her over the top and excessively critical reaction.", "NTA.  She is, indeed, being ridiculous.  Chalk it up to the pregnancy hormones, hopefully.", "Was she malnourished as a baby? Of course not. Is she oxygen starved now? Yes.\n\nNTA", "She needs to grow up. Such an insignificant thing. Malnourished? Wtf", "NTA Is your daughter a hypochondriac? My son was born with a vitamin D deficiency. Breast milk does not have a sufficient amount of vitamin D for some infants and I was advised to supplement with formula. I don't understand with she flew off the handle and is claiming she's malnourished.", "NTA.  I just emailed my mom to ask her if I was breast fed, with a disclaimer that I don't care, but I'm just curious based on something I was reading online.  LOL  \"Fed is best\".", "NTA, fed is always best. It's such a personal decision, and not everyone even gets their milk supply in sufficient quantities, if at all. I get wanting to breastfeed as there are some benefits, but to my knowledge, the benefits only really apply during infancy. Certainly simply not being breastfed doesn't make one malnourished, certainly not by the time one is an adult, wtf.", "NTA. I'm laughing over your daughter thinking her nutritional condition as an infant could impact her pregnancy. What a nut. Well, if she'd actually been starved, it seems there would be a possibility her current health could be impacted, but that's clearly not the case here.", "NTA. When would this ever come up? \"Wow great grades, daughter, by the way you've never breastfed.\"", "Wtf I was never breastfed either and I turned out just fine. Your daughter needs to grow TF up cause it's kinda gonna be hard for her to raise a child when she is just as immature as a baby of 3 who will throw a tantrum at any chance they get.

Breastfeeding was a radical act 23 years ago, and not the norm in the US.  WIC would test your children for being malnourished if you did breastfeed, and push formula as \"better\".  She is delusional.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHer pregnancy hormones and nervous new mother research has got her a little mixed up.\n\nI get it. I had beat myself for getting induced and never knowing \"when his real birthday would've been.\"  I eventually snapped out of it because, as parents, we cannot dwell on thoughts like that or you will always feel like a failure to your kids.\n\nAs for OP's daughter. She needs to understand not every mom can breastfeed, or even chooses to, and formula is a miracle of the modern world to help infants get the proper nutrients, no matter the circumstances.  \"Better fed than dead\"", "NTA. I read this as anxiety about being a good mom, to be honest. There\u2019s so much pressure on new moms to breastfeed that I can understand her freaking out about it just because she doesn\u2019t know any better yet. Source: me, having tremendous anxiety about breastfeeding before my kids were born because everyone makes you think you\u2019re setting your kids up for failure if you don\u2019t.", "NTA your daughter sounds like she has been brainwashed.\n\nBreastfeeding is good but it's not the be all and end all.", "There are some advantages to breastfeeding.

I had my baby 2 months ago, i don't breastfeed (tried but had to many difficulties and made me upset and started to hate myself for failing so i stopped) my grandma didnt breastfeed her 3 kids either for the same reasons. Docs and nurses (had 5 doc and 6 nurses while giving birth) all said theres no diff\u00e9rence in breastfeeding and formula except breastfeeding its best to give baby vitamin drops and theres alot of pain and leakage while breastfeeding. Tbh the first few weeks to a month i tried breastfeeding it was hell. \nHopefully ur daughter realizes shes wrong in what she believes about formula fed babys and apologises. And hopefully her doc explains formula is just as good as breastfeeding.", "Sigh. NTA. And I totally want to make a joke about the logic your daughter is using but I will control myself using all the great brain cells I grew from being a formula-fed baby.", "NTA!\n\nBreast may be best, but that doesn't mean that formula is deficient somehow.  Not at all. \n\nLet's hope the doctor sets her straight.", "NTA, your daughter is being brainwashed by fear mongering campaigns. Fed is best.", "NTA. I think in modern culture there\u2019s a obsession with breast feeding which is really unhealthy. The whole \u201cbreast is best\u201d thing has made people a bit kooky. The truth is fed that \u201cfed is best\u201d. \n\nYour daughter, since she\u2019s pregnant, must be reading about the benefits of breast feeding and is now feeling bad (probably driven a bit by pregnancy hormones as well). A lot of \u201cmom guilt\u201d can accumulate when you read all these blogs, and books and whatnot.\n\nBut you\u2019re NTA. If she hit all her milestones then she\u2019s not unhealthy. She just needs to chill (though probably don\u2019t say that to her). \n\n- From a new mom who struggled with breast feeding and eventually figured it out.", "NTA, she is indeed be ridiculous. Hopefully her doctor will reassure her and help calm things down.", "NTA.  Daughter needs to chill way the fuck out.  Unless there's been a revaluation that the formula OP used has led to medical issues later in life, how she was fed as a baby is completely irrelevant to what she chooses to do. Othewise, if it wasn't a problem in her first 23 years on life it sure as hell isn't one now.", "Woah. NTA. I have two kids and never breastfed and neither have suffered any consequences. She actually called her doctor?! Her doctor will be absolutely thrilled about that /s", "Your daughter probably feels like you did not bother do try giving her the best option and thinks formulas from that time were significantly lower in quality than breastmilk. Normally stuff like that would not matter much to most people, but her hormones clearly amplify things. But it does not make her accusations any less ridiculous, her ration as a baby was good enough and means nothing now, her knowing would not change a thing in her doctor's recommendations. So totally NTA.", "NTA  \nYour daughter is fine and your grandchild will be too. So if you want a few answers about breatsfeeding here they are:   \n\n\nShe should take advantage of being still in pregnancy and do some simple exercises on her breast. Purchase a slightly rough bath sponge and advise her to gently dry rub it around the areola. This will help strengthen the skin and desensitize the nipple until the day of birth. Encourage her to do this whenever she can, and it should be something comfortable. After that, she should apply almond oil to moisturize. **This is just a pre-birth exercise.**\r  \n\r  \nHere are some things to know afterward. The first milk that comes out is very yellow. It's necessary for her to breastfeed in a comfortable position (for example, my baby only latched on when I lay in bed. Before that, it was a struggle because I was always sitting). Don't let the baby fall asleep while nursing, as they might end up chewing on the nipple, and that can be painful later. Also, make sure not to let milk flow into the baby's ear, as it can lead to ear infections. Always keep a clean towel nearby.   \n\n\nIf you need to ask more, DM me, ok? Good luck.", "NTA- there is no difference between breastfeeding and formula.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
