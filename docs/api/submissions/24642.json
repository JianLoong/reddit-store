It was either go back to Italy to qualify as a surgeon or go to Canada, which is much closer to the East Coast where our boys and I live. We worked out which holidays she would have them and who would travel to where etc. There have been a lot of tearful FaceTime phone calls between them since she left last month, but that is their primary means of communication. My fiancee (30F) and I are getting married next month. We went to my family's beach day and the four of us (me, my fiancee and my sons took a photo together on the sand) and she posted it with the caption \"Me and my favorite guys\". I reshared it and wrote, \"If I asked for any more, it'd make me a selfish man.\" My ex saw it and responded to me privately, \"Wow, way to rub salt in the wound. Those are *our* boys, not hers.

The boys understand that their mother has had to leave the USA to become a doctor and help people and that if she had another option to stay, she would've went with that.

She might feel like she has abandoned her children, but reality isn\u2019t quite that simple and it\u2019s the stress and fear likely creating these anxious, intrusive thoughts.

Slight care, my foot. She deserves similar if not the same respect. You sound clueless.", "How is OP trying to keep the kid away exactly ?!  She had to go away for her career. OP is not responsible for that.\n\nHe has every right to move on with his new family. Do you expect OP to be stuck in the past and never date again ?!", "You fianc\u00e9 sounds amazing and I\u2019m glad your kids have a mother in their life who will be present not absent for 3-7 years. Imagine choosing a career over being there to comfort your kids when they are sick, or going to their school plays, your ex is selfish and she has no right to be jealous. She\u2019s not a mother", "The ex isn't selfish for having a career! She takes care of her kids when she isn't working or away for work. She leaves them in the custody of their father while she works.\n\nWhy don't you blame the father for being at work while his fianc\u00e9e took care of the kids? \n\nParents need to work and that means daycare, babysitters, or family stepping up to care for them. \n\nThese kids are lucky to have people who love them.\n\nEx is being sad and jealous, but hopefully it is a one off.", "Lol don\u2019t have kids then if your job requires you to leave your child for 3-7 years and then get mad when the fianc\u00e9 whose more present than you are posts a photo of them doing stuff I\u2019m sure they wish they could do with their mom. And she\u2019s going to work in another country. Can you imagine making the decision to have a career that means you don\u2019t get to see your kids except over FaceTime, those kids will grow up with serious hatred of that woman", "She\u2019s already a doctor. She can\u2019t get a job without the proper training. What don\u2019t you get? It\u2019s ridiculous that you think she should start all over again. There\u2019s no point to doing that. By the time she gets to the point where she\u2019s making good money in another career path, she could have finished her residency.", "I'm sure your fianc\u00e9e is wonderful, but boundaries are important. Perhaps you three should have a sit down on what is acceptable and not. And then that way everyone will feel heard and it can avoid any unnecessary confusion or tension between you when you're trying to co-parent. \n\nOne day your fianc\u00e9e might have a baby, and even though she loves your kids, her feelings towards her own baby will be of similar feeling as your ex. Step parents are parents too but your kids have two parents and a bonus parent. The roles are different even if it doesn't seem that way. So the best thing to do is to have a conversation about boundaries, and what is acceptable amongst all parties.", "She's your ex. Time to stop caring about her feelings.", "NAH - it\u2019s honestly great that your fianc\u00e9 loves your sons however I will say the caption you used along with your re-post is frankly so twee it made me cringe a little. I can easily see why the posts may have rubbed your ex the wrong way but you do have the right to post.", "NTA Most would be happy their kid has good stepparents. I think your ex just misses them. I wouldn't make a fight out of this yet.", "Found the bitter baby mama", "OOOOOO actually I have an idea OP. I\u2019m posting a new comment since the other I posted to this reply was already long and I don\u2019t want this getting lost in it.\n\nAnyway, my idea is maybe writing a story and making it into a book that can be saved. It can be a story about how their mom moved to a whole new country for her education and while she was there she was blessed with two baby boys, but she wasn\u2019t allowed to stay. It can be about how her love for them is stronger than the distance. If she is looking to get a new visa to move back then that could be included. Maybe y\u2019all could even do a few over time that include adventures. It doesn\u2019t have to be so obvious, like it can use different themes to allude to the situation without outright saying it. The two of you could write it together or maybe someone would be willing to help write it for you, but use things you both say to personalize it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there are creative writing subs where someone would be interested in helping. Hell, I\u2019m not the best with creative writing, but I\u2019d be happy to help and write it/draw pictures for it. You could also include pictures of her and the kids/you and the kids from over the years.\n\nIdk, it seems like a cute idea to me, but I know it would barely be a bandaid considering how rough this is for everyone.", "You are perceptive and empathetic", "I was away from my child for 3 weeks and I was a wreck. I missed him so much. And that was because I was ill in possible. I knew I would see him soon and take care of him again. \n\nYou are handling this with Grace and saying all the right things. \n\nThe one thing I would suggest is at next contact is to ask your fianc\u00e9e and your ex to take a family picture together for the boys benefit and have that picture placed in your home. Nobody needs to feel pushed out and the boys know everybody loves them. Make a conscious effort of taking pictures of the boys with their mother.\n\nThings you can do to make the transition easier for mom. \n\nRecord them going through the school gates. With love you mom etc. if time difference is going to be a problem with school, record a video of them telling her how their first day went. \n\nSend a message on a Saturday with pictures and highlights of the week. \n\nOnce a month send mom a care package with pictures the boys have drawn at school and chosen specifically to Send to mom. \n\nGet mom to buy a teddy for each of the boys. And the boys buy one for mom. Mom and the boys swap teddies at visits. Boys will know mom is coming to swap teddy\u2019s and have a piece of her at all times. In between visits boys can take pictures of \u201cTeddy\u2019s\u201d adventures and mom can do the same, they can then send them to mom. \n\nIf mom doesn\u2019t have time to talk get her to record videos that the boys can watch. \n\nInclude her in things like birthdays. Suggest she buys and sends their Halloween costumes etc. \n\nBe creative. \n\nThings will die down and you won\u2019t need to make so much effort because mom won\u2019t need to be reassured so much because she will know and feel they still love her but right now all she\u2019s seeing his family pictures and tearful face time calls. \n\nYour boys will thank you for the kind of father you are later", "NAH", "No you\u2019re not.", "NAH... I'm sure it is painful.  Continue being gentle with each other. Of course your pictures will include their extended family.", "Info could she really not get into any amerocan hospitals?", "\"she's a pretty big figure to them.\"\n\nOr maybe they'll be here in 10 years saying she means nothing to them and she was always trying to post \"family photos\" on social, even though she's not family. There's a lot of that here. Who knows?", "NTAH, your fianc\u00e9 seems like a good person and your boys are lucky to have her in their lives.", "Maybe by emphasizing that there are 3 parents now", "I agree - I think the way it was stated as her favorite guys was very respectful to your ex, not trying to code it as being their mom. It\u2019s important for kids to feel included in their families, and I would try to emphasize this to your ex. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s under crazy stress too, it is very hard to be away from your kids. NAH", "I have sole physical custody. She has visitation. She didn\u2019t match anywhere in the USA, but matched in Canada for her surgical residency. Thank you a lot for this.", "NTA. She should be grateful.", "I agree. It's what the kids think matters most. If the kids are happy, so should she be. \n\nI don't personally like my kids' stepmom, but I can't deny she's a good stepmom and that my kids really like and trust her.", "I guess when you\u2019ve dedicated your life to becoming a medical DOCTOR, she\u2019s probably counting on being to be able to provide better for her boys in the future, ya know, with the salary of a DOCTOR. Doctors make a lot more money on average than college drop outs."]}
