About 4 months into our relationship he wanted to get his very first tattoo. Initially, I was excited because I have some. He told he had been thinking about getting this tattoo for a couple years, but he just never got around to making the appointment. Long story short, he got \u201cWhite Trash\u201d tattooed across his chest in very large cursive font. When I saw the tattoo, I almost couldn\u2019t believe it. I know it is his body, he can put whatever he wants on it and express himself how he wants to, but I am embarrassed by his tattoo because of the stigma around the phrase (bigotry, racism, ignorance, etc.), and because I think the phrase itself is offensive, classist, and racist. I have visions of us at a family event, hanging with my friends at the beach, or wherever, and everyone seeing his tattoo, and I get so embarrassed. I asked him why he got it, and he said \u201cthat\u2019s where I came from and I never want to be there again, so this is my way of reclaiming what I\u2019ve been called my entire life.\u201d He has aspirations to be very wealthy in the future, so he also thinks it will be hilarious to be a \u201cwhite trash millionaire\u201d with that tattooed on his chest. He calls himself white trash a lot, but he is the first person in his family to buy a house, he makes 6 figures a year, and has really done well for himself considering all of the hardship he went through. He is far from \u201ctrash\u201d, and I told him that I hate the tattoo because I hate that he has forever labeled himself as \u201ctrash\u201d, in addition to the phrase being extremely offensive to most people, and that there are not a lot of positive thing associated with being \u201cwhite trash\u201d. I would hate for people to look at him and assume his character just because of the tattoo. He has told me that he hates how much I don\u2019t like it, and how I\u2019m the only person in his life that feels this way about it. I can accept his reasoning for getting it, and I respect his feelings about it, but I can\u2019t get over how much I hate it and how I think it\u2019s so cringey. I have gotten more used to it now, and I know he has much more depth to him than the tattoo, but it has caused some conflict in our relationship because I still struggle with how turned off I am by it. AITA?\nedit: He asked me my opinion on it after he got it. I didn\u2019t just blurt out and say how ugly I thought it was.

He's not wrong, but he has made an unfortunate choice. \n\nYou're not wrong, either. It sounds hideous to me. Huge chest tattoos are seen as similar to tramp stamps. They are often seen as gaudy and cheap. To the world at large, it won't be seen as ironic but as identification. Many, if not most, will agree with it.\n\nYour boyfriend had some serious self-image issues and could do with some serious therapy.  Maybe suggest couples therapy to help you understand his perspective.  If you mention him calling himself PWT often along with the tattoo, maybe the therapist will advise individual therapy.\n\nIt sounds like maybe your husband sees himself as PWT and thinks others think that too.

For some context, in the beginning of us dating (maybe 1-2 months in) he did say he wanted to get \u201cwhite trash\u201d tattooed across his chest, but I just laughed and thought he was joking because he has some self deprecating humor, and he calls himself white trash a lot.

It might very well have persuaded him to call it off, change its location, or size if he had still decided to go through with it anyway. I agree it was a poor choice on his part to have that put on himself, but in the end, he did. It's no longer about the fact he did or shouldn't have however, it's now down to if you can look past it. He doesn't need to be reminded of your disappointment and/ or disdain every time he takes his shirt off. If he is going to receive judgment from it, then it is his cross to bear, so to speak. However, if you feel that it will somehow change people perception of you, well, that's a case for vanity or probably better company.

I did ask him why he decided on that size/font/location because it would have been way more tasteful if it was smaller/somewhere else but he was adamant that he had thought about it for a long time and knew exactly what he wanted and why.

Just what every kid needs when they\u2019re desperately trying to fit in at school is a dad with White Trash tattooed across his chest at school pickup.", "If you dump him he will have a hard time finding another girlfriend.", "I'm going with NTA.  But I do want to ask, if he already had this tattoo when you first got together would you have stuck around?", "NTA and it'd be very easy to change to \"white toosh\" is it becomes a bigger problem.", "YTA.  You are pushing your values on something he cares about. He's told you multiple times what he was planning on getting. You are the one who did not take it seriously. \n\nLet's flip the script. What if he treated one of your tattoos in a similar manner? How would you feel about that? something that meant alot to you, a deep symbolic piece showing the depth of your intimate past with that piece?\n\nAt this point are you trying to make him second guess himself and his self esteem? \n\nIf you keep perpetuating this negativity, how are you any better than the people who are racist ignorant bigots? \n\nIf you are so caught up on this superficial issue, then there is a massive incompatibility between you both. \n\nIf you can't deal with that tattoo being there, then you need to decide if it is a deal breaker or not. \n\nIf other people's opinions dictate your life so much, are you not just living somebody else's life? \n\nWhy does someone on the beach looking at his tattoo matter to you? \n\nLife is too short to care what random folk think when they look at you.", "I'm sorry to tell you that, regardless of what you have tattooed or where, people will absolutely make baseless assumptions about your character despite what you have actually achieved.\n\nSource: I'm a respected medical professional with multiple college degrees, over a decade of experience, and both hands tattooed and I have weathered plenty of stupid remarks and backhanded compliments.\n\nUnless he has Nazi tattoos or racial slurs, let your dude live or hit the bricks. YTA.", "It's one thing to have a small white trash tattoo on your body somewhere but it's totally another thing to have a huge tattoo across your chest. I don't think the tattoo idea is a terrible one but the execution and location is in poor taste.", "NTA", "You are NTA for not liking it; you are NTA for saying you don't like it. \n\nHe is NTA for getting it; he is an AH for being so upset with your individual opinion, just because you are a couple does not mean you have to \"love\" everything he does.\n\nI am native descendant, and if I were to ever come across someone who called me a \"rez rat\" or \"dirty little injen,\" I would just laugh in their face and say, \"Yep! And that's why I can live in the woods longer than you.\" but I will never get those phrases tattooed on my body. People who use phrases like this are trying to give pain (a negative) to their victims, but if the victim agrees with it in their own positive way, like him with his tattoo or me with my (not so) witty retort, the abuser no longer has power over their victim. His taking back the power is just a lot more obvious, and I will agree, more easily misinterpreted as an \"Ok?. . .weird flex.\"/\"Danger Will Robinson.\" thing, vs a \"taking back my power\" thing.", "NTA", "NTA, you aren't telling him to hide it or anything. He said you're the only one in his life that doesn't like it? Who in his life is giving him such bad advice saying this was a good idea? Lol", "I see what you did there. \ud83d\ude02", "Oh my GOD this. Former military too. My NCO had the \u201cslippery when wet\u201d sign tattooed just above her vag.

Probably wouldn't do the blocks by the tires would definitely be flat/gone, rims crumbling. \n\nBut I think the words are still trashy lmao", "Clerks 2 and yeah that's the right slur. Randall's grandmother used to call him it and he didn't know it was a slur, so when he found out he decided to try to reclaim it. xD", "Had a teacher in my tech school that had a jar of jam tattooed on one of her toes.", "I hooked up with a guy that had \"He Is Risen\" tattooed oh his abdomen just a few inches above his penis.

He's also military.", "OH MY GOD \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 my brain is not firing on all 4 cylinders tonight. I mean that\u2019s pretty fucking funny \ud83d\ude02", "\ud83e\udd23 That's okay. That's one of the weird/silly one's I saw in service and only because she was at the same tattoo shop I was in, getting another tat done."]}
