M is currently six months pregnant and she has been planning a baby shower with all of our nearest and dearest, which is due to be held next month. M has told me that she would love for my daughter B (23f) to attend the shower, as she wants B to have a good relationship with her new sister, and some of the games that M has planned would work out better if B attended.\n\nHowever, B and M do NOT see eye to eye. B is very low contact with me and does not speak to or interact with M unless there is an urgent need to do so because of a series of arguments they have had over the last few years. I reached out to B and her wife and asked if they would please consider coming to the party for my sake, but B flat out refused. She did this very rudely, I might add, and called M some unsavoury names via text.\n\nThis really upset M, who was in tears for days, and the stress of our baby not having a relationship with her sister made her feel ill and she was lying on the couch quite literally shaking for hours at a time. She personally texted B (I had to give her B\u2019s number to do this), and begged her repeatedly to please come. And B blocked her.\n\nI was incredibly worried about M and wanted to convince B to come to the party. So, I have some very sentimental jewellery which once belonged to B\u2019s mother, my former wife who sadly died many years ago. B was not aware I and M actually have this jewellery, but it includes B\u2019s mother\u2019s engagement ring, which I had told B was lost. \n\nI messaged B and told her that I have the jewellery, and if she agrees to do this one thing for me and come to M\u2019s baby shower without pulling any stunts or theatrics, and she plays along with the games on M\u2019s special day, I will give her the jewellery. \n\nB\u2019s wife then called me and told me I was \u201cholding the jewellery hostage\u201d as a bribe and it did not belong to me \u201cwith the way I have treated my dead wife\u2019s memory.\u201d She asked if I would be willing to give B the ring anyway as a gesture of good will. I told her that that was not going to happen, and if they do not come to the party then I will gift the jewellery and the ring to M, who my dead wife would have loved. B and her wife have since called me and M selfish asses, and are still refusing to come to the party. \n\nM has taken my side and says that it was a fair trade off, and she is still beside herself with illness over the party. However, my sisters and B\u2019s maternal family have been attacking me over this and I am worried I have permanently ruined my relationship with my daughter. \n\nAll I wanted was for my unborn daughter to have a big sister to look up to and love.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676229133, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110nlr8/aita_for_using_my_dead_wifes_jewellery_as_a_bribe/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
