Aline, Aaron, and I quickly left, not wanting to stir any more drama.\n\nMel came by the next day, apologizing for screaming at me and accusing me. However, Mel told me Burp kicked her out of their place. Aline and I agreed to let her stay.\n\nTwo months ago:\n\nMel was still on our couch two months later, hunting for a new place. That morning, Aline and I had asked Mel to start paying for her share, as our bills were getting high and unaffordable. Mel stormed out, pissed calling us the worst friends. Later in the evening, Aaron and Aline's bf came over for some drinks and game night; we welcomed Mel when she returned home to join us and acted like nothing happened (Mel was always dramatic).Mel started paying and life went on.\n\nWe started to get nasty texts and calls from friends and people we knew, telling us how disgusting Aaron was. Half of his friends aren\u2019t talking to him, calling him awful things. Later, Aaron found threatening letters at his door and his car. He has been getting calls from people and texts from people he doesn\u2019t know telling him to end it and how horrible he is. Aaron's family found out, and I told them the truth; they have been trying to see them, but he hides. He deactivated his socials and has been on sick leave from work since.\n\nWe were so lost to who would do this or what this is about. Then, Burp sent me a screenshot of Mel bragging to her how she was breaking me up, how this is revenge on me for ruining her relationship. She has been telling everyone Aaron cheated on me, calling him racial slurs and all other derogatory things about him.\n\nAline and I packed her things and put them outside the door. We changed our lock while Mel was at work. We sent her a text telling her to find somewhere else to go. Mel called Aline, asking how we could throw her out and Aline told her off.\n\nThis is where I may TA. I forwarded the text to all our friends and some of her immediate family. It got posted online with her tagged in it. Her work found out, and her school and she both been fired and suspended for the racial comments. I never intended for it to have such a large impact on her. She lost all her friends and her family is low contact with her now.

NTA", "NTA she was literally pushing your boyfriend towards suicide and could not care less. She deserves everything that happens to her, that's the natural consequences of her actions.", "The very definition of FAFO.\n\nNTA in the slightest.", "NTA\n\nThe best time to have ended your relationship with Mel was when she accused you of wanting to steal her bf.\n\nWhatever Mel is going through now is the consequences of her own actions.", "Yeah this is the correct answer", "Yeah this is the correct answer tbh", "How is critiquing someone's writing style productive? Actually, it violated this subreddit rules; it isn't civil. Not everyone has the same linguistics skills or grasp of writing. You don't know OP. Plus judging by your posts you aren't some intellect or great mind of the century.", "Sure, but how do you know that Mel isn\u2019t the total psycho?\nLike yeah, maybe Burp faked it because he\u2019s a psycho, or maybe Mel is the psycho. Maybe Mel is the person that\u2019s \u201cthat scummy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not like she got in a fight with her boyfriend for being nice to a woman that isn\u2019t her\u2026 wait never mind.\n\nIt\u2019s not like she threw a fit when she couldn\u2019t freeload off\u2026 wait never mind.\n\nIt also seems like the harassment on Aaron ended after Mel\u2019s lies became public. If they were totally unrelated, wouldn\u2019t he still be getting harassed?", "[removed]", "I can see how she could feel she was being an asshole. She got her back as much as a person could.", "Hey sweetie!  How is Aaron.  Is he seeking any kind of help?  If he lets you keep him close, he needs to let someone care for him.", "... why am I getting replies the are clearly meant for op there have been like 5", "He is with the perfect people right now! I am a social worker in mental health, my mom is a psych nurse, and his mom is a therapist, his brother is a mental health worker. He has an army of us around him, showering him with love and support. We are working together to ensure his mental wellness. He is in therapy, and he has many people to support him. \n\nWith his blessing, I made sure to let loved ones know he was depressed and created a clan of very loving warriors. He is most concerned with me and protecting me, but I am working behind him to make sure he is most cared for.\n\nThank you for your concern <3", "And that he needs a new nickname", "They're just bots lol", "I\u2019m so happy to hear that.  When you said he was isolating I was concerned- I\u2019ve been there.", "I figured it was a fake OP name.", "NTA but why did you call her exbf Burp?? He seems alright lol", "NTA  You obviously care, which is why your conscience isn't clear. But this domino effect was started by Mel. She is the one who made baseless accusations that made Burp throw her out. You & Aline cared, and took her in. She is the one who refused to help with bills, and again you forgave her. Now she's seen fit to slander Aaron in petty revenge. Three strikes and she is out.", "NTA but let\u2019s be all the way real. You did not need us to tell you that.", "NTA!\nShe is a horrible friend. She blamed you for something that didn\u2019t happen. Then gave you crap about paying rent, then slandered your bf, endangering his life, just because she blames you for end her relationship bc of the incident she made up. \n\nGirl run", "Now nope nope! NTA We all have to call racists out! Her comments bit her in the ass... That is so not your fault! I guess if she wanted to keep her life together she shouldn't be a shitty friend to everybody", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. In this case, losing their job from using slurs. NTA", "NTA \n\nShe had no problem ruining Aaron's reputation and peace of mind by making horrible things up that she spread around to others to publicly shame him and humiliate him (and by extension you as well).  \n\nYou simply set the record straight by providing proof that she was lying to everyone. This stops others from being her victims by falling for her tricks and then mistakenly hurting their relationships with others based on believing those lies. (It must be humiliating for a person to realize they've been lied to and devastating to know that they then hurt their friendships by acting rude to said friend because of their belief in those lies. I hope all of those friends of Aaron's that believed her lies have called him to humbly apologize and offer to make amends.)  \n\nExposing her lies also gives a public warning to others to become involved with her at their own risk.  Such a warning will hopefully help others from unsuspectingly falling for \"friendship' and thus her manipulation and abuse.  It may also give some answers to others who suffered from her manipulation but could never prove it or understand what exactly happened or who did so.  She's probably been acting in such awful ways for years and some of her victims might have always had a lingering suspicion that it was her but never had an example of her nasty attitude until now when you shared what she did.\n\nYou also exposed her racism.  She was then fired so that she would not have the opportunity to victimize others, co-workers and clients, at her place of work (by discriminating against them, slipping up and calling them a racial slur to their face, etc.).", "I agree with you on that. Ten years of friendship made me prone to forgiving her.", "It is just nickname we gave him, as he can belch the alphabet.", "Sure totally could be, but I  this day and age I need more proof than a screen shot from someone who hit on me one time. This is why you believe the victim but you don't persecute without evidence.", "I hope Aaron recovers from this. And Ms old work place and school had to kick her out. She could be involved in other scandals, frauds, gossips or investigations. You only brought some light. Can you imagine how many were tricked by her? \nHope you and Aline are better. And give Aline some hugs, she is the friend you need around. And great Aline has a friend like you too.", "Ok, I think I see your mistake. Burp didn\u2019t hit on OP.\n\nOp says\n>Burp stopped me, checking on my and Aline.\n\nThat is not flirting. And if you\u2019re referring to a different moment, by all means, point it out.\n\nThat being said, a screenshot is perfectly valid piece of evidence. They are counted as admissible evidence in a court of law. Photoshop or some other means of faking it are possible, but handwriting can be forged, and even voices can be faked, nowadays.\n\nBesides, why aren\u2019t you counting Mel\u2019s behaviors as evidence? She has previously shown \u201cpsychotic\u201d behaviors, like immediately assuming and accusing OP of trying to \u2018steal her man,\u2019 when all they were doing was talking. That sounds pretty crazy to me.", "Yes! Burp is the man! Great guy."]}
