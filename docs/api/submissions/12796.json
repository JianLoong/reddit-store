The thing was that the kid was quite happy to be called Andy.\n\nMy daughter has a four syllable name, and we knew it was inevitable that people would shorten her name.  We REALLY didn't like the first short that most people would go for, but were ok with another one.

We did have to ask her to use the full name when writing it, but otherwise no problems.\n\nThe funny part is that after fully expecting it to be shortened, and 'managing' it, she has hardly ever been shortened!  No one at school shortens it at all, and she's 16 now.  The only people we hear it from really are her brother sometimes, and my dad usually calls her by the short.  It's actually so rare that it's almost become a special name she gets called by her Pop.\n\nHer twin brother has a simple 2 syllable name, which is often shortened.  We didn't really hear it shortened much at all until he was about 8 and doing sports.  Then it often became shortened because that was easier to shout across the field.  He didn't like it being shortened at first, but then started associating the short with his beloved sport, and stopped caring.  Now he doesn't care at all.\n\nWhen choosing names, we thought carefully about names and how they could be shortened, and only chose names where we could live with the short, because we knew we couldn't control it.
