Pretty standard stuff.", "NTA.\n\nWhen choosing a name for a kid, one should think of potential nicknames, initial combinations, can you shout the name without laughing, etc.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t see the point in dying on this hill. She\u2019ll figure it out on her own. I\u2019d just apologize that you upset her and let life prove you right later.", "NTA. As she grows they might even come up with nicknames that have nothing to do with her actual name. Sounds unrealistic to have the teacher monitoring that. When her daughter is older she can chose for herself and correct people as needed.", "NTA.   Your sister was a fool for calling her daughter something when she doesn't like the shortened version of that name.", "NTA Because she is trying to correct others. You should listen to Matthew Mcconaughey talk about why he goes by Matthew and not Matt. His mom told HIM why she named him Matthew and he respected that enough to not let others call him Matt. The only person she should be correcting is her daughter when she is old enough. Her daughter is the only one that can tell others to call her by a specific name.\n\nEdit for spelling and clarification.", "NTA she\u2019s being insanely ridiculous and the fact that she thinks she can control the nicknames that her child gets when she\u2019s around her peers at school is laughable.

Especially since she was ranting.\n\nKids can\u2019t even say a lot of names properly in preschool. I know it was a challenge with my sons name at that age.", "It sounds to me like you should have stayed out of it. Not because you\u2019re wrong, but because your sister sounds like she has unrealistic expectations about where the boundary of her parenting authority ends. It\u2019s fine for her to ask the teacher not to use a nickname, but to expect that children won\u2019t, and that their parents will enforce it, is unrealistic, and will get less realistic with time. At 3 she seems invasive. At 7, she\u2019ll seem ridiculous. At 10 she\u2019ll be endangering her daughter\u2019s relationships at school.\n\nNTA - you weren\u2019t telling her how to parent. You were pointing out that her stated plan may be unrealistic.", "INFO: How does your niece feel about the nicknames? At three she can make that more than clear. Her opinion is the only one that matters here.", "ESH.   But your sister more than you.  You aren\u2019t wrong.  Your sister can\u2019t control if other kids abbreviate her name, especially as she gets older.  And your niece may have her own opinion when she gets older.\n\nBut there wasn\u2019t really a reason for you to put your two cents in.  And you probably knew it would piss her off.  She will figure this out on her own and will be upset when she figures it out.  Pointing out the obvious is rarely appreciated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is only the very beginning of things about and by her daughter she can\u2019t control.", "I'll say, as a teacher, sometimes trying to \"correct student behaviour\" can make them lean into it more. A good example is profanity. I teach teenagers, and the more I try get them to not use profanity, the more they will use it.

You are giving her a reality check.  She will eventually get there on her own.  Many parents go through the \u201csacred name\u201d phase.

It's not a hard thing for peers/teachers/etc to stick to a requested name (be it the parents or the child when they decide they prefer one or the other).  Save your battle for when Katie voices she wants to go by Kate.  Until then it's not your business.", "Yeah kids have a hard grip over language and saying their full name themselves. Most toddlers use a monosyllabic version of their and friend's names until they get older. \n\nMost of my friends and coworkers go by a nickname as adults even.

I will never understand parents who give their children names with obvious/common nicknames they\u2019re not okay with their kids being called. Even if it were enforceable with other kids (unlikely and not as easy as adults), what if the child decides they like the nickname and WANT to go by it? At some point, your sister has to accept this is not something she has control over.", "NTA Also it doesn't sound like Lauren has even asked what her daughter wants.", "NTA. \n\nI have a name like that and my mother decided I had to go by the long version in third grade. She insisted that I correct everyone who used a shorter version \u2014 friends, teachers, family. I\u2019d come back from a new club or activity and she\u2019d always ask if people called me by the right name. I hated it and it caused so many fights. Mean people made fun of me, nice people were confused. To this day, she loves telling people how great my name is. I\u2019ve resented it for decades. I love my mom, but when she is gone someday, I\u2019m going back to the shorter name I was born with.", "NTA, however from now on I would stay out of it and let the consequences of her own choices catch up with her. I also have a name that can be shortened, and many people do. My father always hated it and used to rant at me and tell me that I had to insist that other people use my full name. However, I like when people shorten it. I've noticed it happens once people feel comfortable with me and I have a positive association for that reason. Weirdly enough, my weird control freak father was cut off about a decade ago, make of that what you will.", "I will say the nickname my kid has picked up at school was slightly unexpected (think like Brenny for Brendan, you can see how they got there but it's not standard).  But you definitely can't control how small children choose to operate.", "I love that \ud83d\ude02 I go by Liz but write down the full Elizabeth on any and all paperwork. My dad calls me Elizabeth, mom calls me Liz-Bethy or other variants of that, siblings switch between Lizzie and Elizabeth\u2026 one even invented E-Beth-Lizzle in childhood and calls me E-Beth to this day. Once the name is out there in the world, people will do various things with it, and parents have little control over that. It\u2019s a silly hill for this woman to die on.\n\nOP, NTA. But I agree with what some others have said that you should consider whether this hill is worth it to you.", "Same here. Still \"Susi\" (german way of Suzy) for most people. And I hate my long name with a passion.", "My mom randomly named me Allison instead of the name they chose because she thought that's not what I looked like, not thinking that she hates the nickname Ally. That was a good spur of the moment decision.", "I'm named Allison and have always hated being called Ally. Is it because my mom hated people calling me that and always corrected them? And my dad, who was a dick, purposefully called me that exclusively and got all his friends to do the same? \n\nPoint is, sister shouldn't weaponize her daughter's name. Can lead to weird issues later lol."]}
