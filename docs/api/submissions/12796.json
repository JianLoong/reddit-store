You can\u2019t control that sort of stuff.  It should be up to the daughter what she likes being called.  Doing what your sister is doing will just have other people steer clear of her and her daughter.", "NTA has she met kids? Like at all? Pretty standard stuff.", "NTA.\n\nWhen choosing a name for a kid, one should think of potential nicknames, initial combinations, can you shout the name without laughing, etc.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t see the point in dying on this hill. She\u2019ll figure it out on her own. I\u2019d just apologize that you upset her and let life prove you right later.", "NTA. As she grows they might even come up with nicknames that have nothing to do with her actual name. Sounds unrealistic to have the teacher monitoring that. When her daughter is older she can chose for herself and correct people as needed.", "NTA.   Your sister was a fool for calling her daughter something when she doesn't like the shortened version of that name.", "NTA Because she is trying to correct others. You should listen to Matthew Mcconaughey talk about why he goes by Matthew and not Matt. His mom told HIM why she named him Matthew and he respected that enough to not let others call him Matt. The only person she should be correcting is her daughter when she is old enough. Her daughter is the only one that can tell others to call her by a specific name.\n\nEdit for spelling and clarification.", "NTA she\u2019s being insanely ridiculous and the fact that she thinks she can control the nicknames that her child gets when she\u2019s around her peers at school is laughable. The only opinion that matters here is that of her daughter. If she doesn\u2019t mind the nickname then what is the issue?", "NTA but I\u2019d stay out of it going forward.", "NTA. Especially since she was ranting.\n\nKids can\u2019t even say a lot of names properly in preschool. I know it was a challenge with my sons name at that age.", "It sounds to me like you should have stayed out of it. Not because you\u2019re wrong, but because your sister sounds like she has unrealistic expectations about where the boundary of her parenting authority ends. It\u2019s fine for her to ask the teacher not to use a nickname, but to expect that children won\u2019t, and that their parents will enforce it, is unrealistic, and will get less realistic with time. At 3 she seems invasive. At 7, she\u2019ll seem ridiculous. At 10 she\u2019ll be endangering her daughter\u2019s relationships at school.\n\nNTA - you weren\u2019t telling her how to parent. You were pointing out that her stated plan may be unrealistic.", "INFO: How does your niece feel about the nicknames? At three she can make that more than clear. Her opinion is the only one that matters here.", "ESH.   But your sister more than you.  You aren\u2019t wrong.  Your sister can\u2019t control if other kids abbreviate her name, especially as she gets older.  And your niece may have her own opinion when she gets older.\n\nBut there wasn\u2019t really a reason for you to put your two cents in.  And you probably knew it would piss her off.  She will figure this out on her own and will be upset when she figures it out.  Pointing out the obvious is rarely appreciated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
