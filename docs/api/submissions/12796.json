The thing was that the kid was quite happy to be called Andy.\n\nMy daughter has a four syllable name, and we knew it was inevitable that people would shorten her name.  We REALLY didn't like the first short that most people would go for, but were ok with another one.

We did have to ask her to use the full name when writing it, but otherwise no problems.\n\nThe funny part is that after fully expecting it to be shortened, and 'managing' it, she has hardly ever been shortened!  No one at school shortens it at all, and she's 16 now.  The only people we hear it from really are her brother sometimes, and my dad usually calls her by the short.  It's actually so rare that it's almost become a special name she gets called by her Pop.\n\nHer twin brother has a simple 2 syllable name, which is often shortened.  We didn't really hear it shortened much at all until he was about 8 and doing sports.  Then it often became shortened because that was easier to shout across the field.  He didn't like it being shortened at first, but then started associating the short with his beloved sport, and stopped caring.  Now he doesn't care at all.\n\nWhen choosing names, we thought carefully about names and how they could be shortened, and only chose names where we could live with the short, because we knew we couldn't control it.

The two ppl who came up with it were aware). At first i fought it, but at some point I just didn't care, except when my close friends called me that, which I asked them not to, and they stopped.\n\nMy point is, there will be a lot of nicknames that kid gets, regardless of what their actual name is, and all that can really be done is teaching the kid boundaries, so she knows whether she likes or dislikes being called something and hopefully address it from there.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Ugh.", "NTA I\u2019ve seen situations like this before where a parent was very adamant about their kids name not being shortened only for the kids to prefer the shortened version of their name and requesting their parent to use it too, I suspect that as her daughter gets older and probably prefers the shortened version she will have to accept that other people call her that.", "NTA.

Your sister picked the name and should've known better, and if she's this particular about something that she'll never, ever be able to control, the daughter is in for a tough time keeping her mother out of her every waking moment until she moves out (and maybe not then either).

Like all gifts you don't have to like it, and you can choose what you do with it (display it, use it, shove it in a box) because ultimately you are the one using it and living with it.

Things went fine until 7th grade, where my math teacher insisted on calling me Bob, which I actually found flattering, as I loved my Dad of course. \n\nSo that caused a split.
