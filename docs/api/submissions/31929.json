He's a small toddler so he's obviously not going to use it but I plan to send him emails throughout his childhood.  8-10 a year at the most, just emails about what we did, or happy birthday, or pictures from the zoo or beach or whatever.   I'll login periodically to make sure it's not hacked or spam city and to keep it active but other than that,  it'll be an inbox of emails from his dad throughout his childhood.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe plan is to then give him the password for the account at a certain time as a surprise.  His 16th or 18th birthday, or the first day of college, or wedding day.  Who knows, I'll have to wait and see how life unfolds.  He will be given the password to a Gmail that I have been sending him emails for 17-18 years and he'll be able to read them.   I hope we have a great relationship and he has a happy life and this is something that he will cherish forever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did not share this with anyone, even my wife.  The plan was to have it be my thing.  Like a surprise to everyone that I was thinking of him and loving him and communicating that in real time over the course of his life.  But it hit me the other day that maybe excluding her would make her feel left out or dismissed?  In my mind, I didn't originally include her because like I said I wanted something just for him and I.  And my wife, while wonderful, will literally flood that inbox non stop.  I wanted to send 8-10 or so a year so the messages all were special, and it would be an inbox he could read in a sitting or two.  She's like mega-mom and takes pictures and records EVERYTHING and I'm nervous she'll send him hundreds of emails a month lol\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, WIBTA for keeping this to myself?  Is that selfish?

I personally would love to know my partner had been that thoughtful. Honestly you know your wife better than anyone on Reddit, would this be something that would upset her?", "NAH, but tell her about and offer to set up a separate account for her. That way he can have both.", "INFO: Is this login info with your other passwords, etc. printed out with your will?", "My father has passed, and if email was a thing when I was born, this would be cherished beyond anything you will ever know.  Please include some stories from your childhood as well.  \n\nIf you talk to your wife, let her know it's not a place to dump her thoughts daily, but maybe once or twice a year, if she agrees to those terms, let her do it with you.  Coming from an adult's perspective, I would also cherish the memories my mother shared. \n\nThis is a brilliant idea, I am going to suggest this to my children who have babies now.  It's preserving your personal history in a fun and inventive way, make sure the password is written somewhere safe in case the unspeakable happens, so your child can still get to the account.  \n\nNAH, No matter what you do, this is so wonderful.", "I mean - would you be an asshole for doing this? Obviously not, but would your wife possibly be hurt by it? Yes. I think you should at minimum tell your wife your thoughts on doing it. I would expect that most of what you talk about are family things that *involve* your wife. It'd be weird if your son saw it and was like damn why isn't mom in any of these memories and if she is, why isn't she writing any? \n\nPerhaps you write the notes one month / one year and switch on and off with your wife. I wouldn't leave her out of it.", "YWNBTA- I think what you're doing is akin to a journal that you want to eventually gift to him and you're welcome to keep that to yourself until then.  I think this is a lovely idea.  Your son will see thousands of photos/videos in his life, but your writings will put his milestones in a more personal and meaningful context than the exhaustive camera roll we scroll through on our phones.", "Nah but how about actually writing these thoughts down instead of email, emails are easily deleted or lost, but let's are forever\n\nAnd you do not need to include your wife, father child bonds are needed also", "Soft YTA. It's a sweet idea but I think you'll hurt your wife if you don't tell her. Also, when your kid receives them, he might be bummed that his mother wasn't included. \n\nWhy don't you just explain that you want each message to be special so you'd like to agree to a limit regarding how many you each send (and maybe a character limit too lol)? \n\nI'd involve her, and find something else that only you can do for him, something your wife wouldn't want to be involved in.", "This was a Google advert.", "Nah.. but do disclose that it does exist and what the password is just in case something happens to you. \n\nAwesome idea btw!", "I would feel really weird about my husband keeping this from me, I\u2019m not going to lie. Especially as this will be going on for over a decade?\n\nSharing the email address with your wife and grandparents as well would give your child the opportunity to see messages from all of his loved ones.\n\nThis just seems very me, me, me.", "This is a tough one.  I'm going to say NTA though.\n\nI think it's reasonable for you to have this special project for him, something only you do.  If as you say, she's already so involved in his life it stands to reason she will have many shared moments with him that are just the two of them.\n\nOP I think your idea is very sweet and will be cherished.", "NTA and what a beautiful idea for your son!\n\nFathers are allowed to have special 'things' with their kids.  It's beautiful and if I were the mom, I'd be so happy for my son that his dad thought to do that for him.\n\n:)", "Why aren\u2019t you also doing one for your wife?

I know that making those baby books for a second or third child are NOT as detailed as they are for the first born.\n\nNTA for keeping this your project.", "NTA, but delete this message before she finds out about it", "I\u2019d say you have to involve or at least make your other half aware, because you are almost by proxy denying her the chance to do the same and whilst it\u2019s a lovely thought, if you think she\u2019d be upset or disappointed at not knowing you really ought to tell her.\n\nYou could express that this is \u201cyour thing\u201d , and I really get your reasoning and rationale, but I do think I\u2019d be personally a bit gutted or left out if the shoe was on the other foot?", "NTA. You are allowed to have an individual relationship with your child.", "You could also do this with handwritten letters, kept in a shoe box.", "NAH it is possible that your wife might be hurt if she finds out later but also possible that she is not. It wouldn't hurt to talk to her about it.\n\nIf you tell her and she likes the idea and wants to do it too would you mind if she created her own account? It's the same idea but each account would be unique. You'd have photos and memories as a family but also stuff from one on one time making your accounts different. Because one has memories from dad and the other from mom.", "You can encourage her to do something like a journal or picture book where you guys take a pic and write somehting about the event or that day", "NAH\n\nMake sure you log into the account every few months, though.  Gmail announced they would be deleting accounts that had no activity, as defined by logging in, after a period of time.", "NTA and I\u2019m crying a little.  You\u2019re doing a beautiful and meaningful thing for your son.  \nI like the advice that someone else here suggested about setting up a separate account for your wife.  That way she won\u2019t feel left out, and your emails can stay separate.", "I\u2019d feel like a jerk if my husband did this and I didn\u2019t know. Not that I\u2019d like to be a part of it or jealousy, just that it\u2019s such a nice and special thing I\u2019d want to support him and know my child has this wonderful experience coming to him. \n\nI\u2019d tell her you\u2019re doing it and would like to keep it just for you and him.", "YWNBTA.  This is a sweet idea.  I would tell someone else though and give them the login just in case...the unexpected happens.", "NTA\n\nWhat a great idea!  And no, do not tell your wife about it.  If she wants to do something similar, she can but this is just for you and your son.", "Set up a second (kids) account for her", "If you are going to tell her about it she shouldn't send emails or take over....however you can have her join you in writing the emails from the two of you at the same time. She can add to your pics with hers.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a lovely gesture.  If you're not doing it, I suggest you log into the account periodically to clean up spam.\n\nI highly doubt that the administrators of gmail would leave an account intact if someone hasn't logged into it for 18 years.\n\nThis project is your baby.  You don't have to share it with anyone.\n\nIf your wife wants to send e-mail, she can send it to a separate account that either of you could create.", "Here\u2019s an idea. Do the same thing for your wife. You can document special outings, anniversaries, or just days when you thought she looked beautiful, or that she did something that made you realize how special she is. You can then give her the password on your 20th anniversary (or 25th, or whatever feels right.)", "This is a great idea. You should include your wife thought. Your son could filter the emails by sender. Or you could set up folders in the gmail account by sender or subject - ie: birthday messages, from mom, from dad, special occasions. You wouldn't have to go crazy with folders & organization but it could provide some level of priority or importance maybe?", "Honestly I am not sure.  It could go either way!  I just know if I include her it has to happen soon.  I think she would love it either way", "Great point. Make sure the info is included with your estate info in case something happens to you- he\u2019ll treasure having this piece of you", "thank you for sharing", "That's what I was thinking.  Seems risky to me to depend on an e-mail account for all that time.  Write it down on paper and put the originals in the safe.  Keep digital copies.", "Yes, I think I agree with this after reading everything", "thank you for the feedback! That's what I'm looking for", "not a bad idea i guess.  This project is different in that my son lacks the ability to talk yet much less send or receive emails.  So it's communicating on a platform he has yet to learn.  I think the sentiment of decades old emails being read for the first time is much different than that of an adult who can do all of these things.   But a nice idea non the less", "Oh!  Nice idea!!", "Yea 8-10 a year seems like a lot...", "I know this is much cooler than work emails, but like, I can\u2019t stand coming back from a few days off to like 14 emails. The concept is cool but idk that I\u2019d want to read 18 years of emails.", "The other problem I see is what if the email account goes belly up? Google isn't exactly known for supporting their applications.\n\nI'd save everything some other way as well. On a thumb drive or something.\n\nAnd OP could have his wife involved. He could ask her to send four emails a year. One for a birthday and either pick three other holidays or space them every three months. If Mom wants to do something similar, she can start her own email account or thumb drive.", "one and done lol", "She can always make her own gmail account and you guys can keep it separate if your concern is she will flood it. It may be cool for your son to see how both of you guys viewed him growing.", "Then I would tell her about it, she may have sweet photos on her phone that she would like him to see when he\u2019s 18 and there may be moments only she is around for, say if your out at work, that you can both see together on his 18th", "Is there some reason you want to wait until he is 18? He might appreciate it it earlier.", "Too late", "yes!  It is written down and in an envelope in the safe.", "I hate to be morbid, but stuff happens every day. Nobody expects to leave their child fatherless, but wouldn\u2019t you want him to have these things in the event of your passing? I imagine it would be more meaningful.", "I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t be just as sentimental for the woman you are sharing your life with and raising that son with. It also allows you to keep the secret from her without being an asshole.", "That is an excellent idea of how to included her in the project.", "yes I agree very good solution"]}
