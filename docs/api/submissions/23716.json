They fought a lot over stupid stuff, and he even cheated on her (though she never admitted it). He had this old-fashioned belief that women should do all the house chores, so my mom got tired of it and left him. They actually broke up once before (2 years ago), but somehow they got back together after a few weeks, and we moved back in with him.\nHe did support us financially, and he was more present than my real dad, which I appreciate. He even treated me and my sister (16) like his own daughters. The problem is, I never felt close to him, and we often argued. I never saw him as a father figure, so I always called him by his name.\nNow that they're separated, he still helps us financially and visits sometimes. Today, he came over and tried to get me to forgive him and move back in with him. He was almost crying, and it made me uncomfortable. I looked at my mom for help, but she ignored me. He kept asking if he did something wrong and if I still wanted to live with him, saying he might stop helping with my school fees if I didn't.\nHe was the one who offered to help financially, my mom didn't ask for it. She's not going back to him because they had more issues than I mentioned. Personally, I don't want to move back in with him either. I prefer living with my mom by ourselves; it just feels better here.\nI feel guilty and ungrateful for not wanting to go back, I'm not comfortable around him, and his visits stress me out. I've told my mom multiple times that I don't want to live with him again.\nSo, am I the asshole for not wanting to live with him?", "created_utc": 1690970281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g4oh6/aita_for_not_wanting_to_live_with_my_stepdad/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When your mother divorces him, he will literally be no relation to you whatsoever.
