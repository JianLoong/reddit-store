We have no where else to go, and I'll be honest, my SIL is an amazing cook, and New Years dinner is her thing \ud83d\udc4c can't miss it.\n\nEdit 2: hey guys! I just want to clarify, I know they're the AH to expect us to basically babysit. We don't mind at all sitting with the kids. The question I was trying to ask was if I was the AH for not stopping the argument since I was already there instead of just letting it play out (there was no violence, was hoping they would resolve it between cousins.)\n\nI understand the side of people telling me to just not participate in holidays anymore. We have put up boundaries over the last few years, and being sat in the living room will not be a reason to not participate in holidays for us since we do it for the nieces and nephews!
