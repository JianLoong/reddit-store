I just want to clarify, I know they're the AH to expect us to basically babysit. We don't mind at all sitting with the kids. The question I was trying to ask was if I was the AH for not stopping the argument since I was already there instead of just letting it play out (there was no violence, was hoping they would resolve it between cousins.)\n\nI understand the side of people telling me to just not participate in holidays anymore. We have put up boundaries over the last few years, and being sat in the living room will not be a reason to not participate in holidays for us since we do it for the nieces and nephews!

Either have this out with them before the next event occurs, start asking them if you're going to be able to sit down to dinner at the table with everyone else, or start carrying extra chairs in your car and telling them that's OK you'll bring our own chairs. The longer you allow this to continue the worse it will get. Right now it's chairs at the dining table. Who knows what it will have evolved into next year. I realize that's not what you want to hear, you want to give these people the benefit of the doubt \u2013 that is painfully obvious, you are making excuses for this disgusting behavior right and left - but this is not the way to go.", "So NTA You should be seated with everyone else or they shouldn\u2019t host. How incredibly rude! You\u2019re not a 12 yr old cousin. It shows their level\nof disdain for you both. I\u2019d tell them all to go piss up a rope!", "Keep setting your glass down next to them and lean in a little too close each time to retrieve it.", "If need be pack 2 folding chairs and small picnic table next year, if they try the same stunt just say, \"no problem we got you covered\"", "How rude is it to invite people over for dinner and not have enough chairs for them. There\u2019s no way I would be sitting unless all my guests had a seat at the table.", "I agree.", "I too, chose that person's chosen mentor.", "Recliners.", "Girl, from your edits I understand you have no real dilemma", "NTA\n\nBut, if you invite people to your house, you make sure you have enough table space for them to be at the table and not make them eat elsewhere in the house.  The other adult don't seem to think you and your spouse rank as adults because at the time you don't have any children.", "NTA\n\ni think it's reasonable to see where an argument goes with kids, sometimes they loose interest or can work it out for themselves.\n\nYou could of tried the 'knock it off' or 'play with a different game', but ultimately the parents are responsible for their kids.", "pls do a ted talk on advice like this", "There are a million places to get good food.  In some of those places you don't have to be treated like shit to get that food.", "NTA.  OP moved away from family to be around his people who treat them like lesser little beings.", "Not enough information for an answer. It depends on the age of the kids arguing and the nature of the argument. If the kids are younger (say, less than 10) and the argument is over sharing a toy, then get involved. If the kids are older (10+), then have them sit down and work it out (but keep an eye on it in case you need to referee). However, this is your husband\u2019s family. I think it is more appropriate for him to take the lead. The adults may take any decision easier from him than you.", "My mother, after making excuses for my grandmother (narcissist) her entire life, recently had to cut her off for both spreading our personal business, and outright lying about us, to other relatives who then attacked or shunned my mother. Sometimes even if you have love for family, they aren't good for you and there's no reason to take any crap or ruin your own holidays. When I was a kid, I remember things like your above story being a regular thing between my grandma, my mom, and my aunts. I'll miss them and all, but I get along better with my old boss from the gas station I used to work at and I'm more inclined to spend holidays with her than my gossipy, passive aggressive relatives.", "NTA. As a parent, I would be the one going to sit in the living room to supervise my own kid.", "I brought my own chair once... With a little camping table, set myself at the end of the table, opposite to the patriarch of the family, where everyone could see. That was gold.\n\nAnother time with another side of the family I don't see anymore for obvious reasons, it was \"not enough food and cutlery\". Too bad for them, they gifted me just enough cash. I disappeared for 20 minutes before lunch time, as I saw it coming anyway. Came back with my fast food order, sat on a big furniture next to the family pictures. To say the least that was fire in every terms. Kids being jealous I had \"the fun\" food, relatives being mad beyond repair, yelling, screaming, people trying to get my food to throw it away, ... I miss being a little brat haha !", "Say it louder for OP! (Who is sitting over in the living room with the kids)", "That doesnt matter. They are being incredibly rude. This is how it starts. They will start to treat you worse if you allow it.", "Children learn from their parents, and eventually those kids are going to start to treating you like crud as well. If you don\u2019t put a stop to this now, are you going to become the family scapegoats and the children will catch on and do the same thing.", "Not only that, take all of the favourite dish in one of your to go boxes!"]}
