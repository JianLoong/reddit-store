For my sanity and theirs. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. You were 100% in the right; it's not your mother's business to question how you and your husband parent your kids. And if that's a problem for her, then she can stay away. So can any other family member that has a problem with that.", "NTA. She made the choice to double down on being \"right\", which means she doesn't get to see the kids.

The fact that your mom doesn\u2019t think she has to apologize because supposedly she knows best is proof she doesn\u2019t respect you as a human being. \n\nYou are a financially independent man and the breadwinner of your household, you have no obligation to follow her lead on parenting. \n\nI think you have decent cause to consider cutting ties with her. Since you say she\u2019s not contacting you, I would not contact her either. \n\nAnd I would move to a different town so the kids don\u2019t run into her when they get older.\n\nEdit: financially independent man.

My children are the ages of you and your husband, and I can assure you that we never, ever punished our children the \"old way\", although we were both victims of that old system ourselves. And I wouldn't change a thing about how we raised our children.\n\nKeep on being the loving parents that you are, and when your mother shows some respect for your parenting style, maybe you'll want to invite her over again sometime. I wish you and your little family well!", "NTA.

No one who isn't a parent to that child has any right to time with your children, especially if they criticize you for NOT physically assaulting your children.", "People who hit their kids as some shitty type of \"lesson\" are such garbage.

Maybe ask her why she thinks violence is the only way she knows how to discipline and ask her if she goes around assaulting adults when they don't do as she says like she does with her children, ask her why she's okay with assaulting defenceless children but won't do it with adults.\n\nYou set boundaries and told her to stay out of your parenting otherwise she can't see your kids, instead of agreeing to at least try, she decided to become offended and complain... It just proves to you that she doesn't want to stop being the way she is.\n\nKeep toxic and abusive people away from your kids and don't feel bad about it!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
