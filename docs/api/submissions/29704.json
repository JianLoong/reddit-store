{"id": 29704, "submission_id": "17gumdi", "title": "AITA for wanting to wear a suit to my sister's wedding", "selftext": "Throwaway account (also, still new to Reddit)\n\nBackstory: I (28 AFAB), was diagnosed with a \"hormone disorder\" when I was a young-ish teenager and was immediately put on hormone therapy for several years. That's meant that I developed pretty much a \"standard\" female body. Only when questioning my doctors later on did I find out that I could in fact be considered intersex. Tbh, it felt like the pieces suddenly clicked. I've stopped taking medication and developed both a bit of a beard and a much deeper voice - both of which I am happy about. I am looking into the possibility to also transition genders officially. I just do not feel like I am a woman (at all).\n\nNow, my sister is getting married next year and I have asked her if I could wear a suit to her wedding. At first, she was against it, but we sat down and talked and in the end, she told me that she would be happy to have me in a suit at her wedding. Her only stipulation was that it had to be \"a proper three piece\" - which I do in fact own already and am planning to wear.\n\nSince then, my parents found out and my mother has called repeatedly to tell me that I would be \"embarrassing\" them and that I should just keep it together (read: wear a ballgown) for the wedding. She also accused me of making my sister's day all about myself. My parents both made a point to remind me to \"shave in time for the wedding\".\n\nIn my mind, I still think that a suit would not be the end of the world and that it suits (sorry) me much better than dresses ever did. So, AITA?\n\nEdit (+typo fix): Thank you so much for all the comments, it's been kind of surreal. Since it's easier to address questions here - our relatives know about it and at least the ones in our generation are fine with it. I'm not doing a \"SURPRISE - Guess how long the beard has grown since you last saw me\" at the wedding. \n\nI'm also never going to look like \"a full man\". That ship has sailed (too much bosom which I am not willing to get surgically removed, too little beard to make a convincing sailor). I'll probably always look like someone in-between and that's fine by me. \n\nOn that note: Ever since I realized how I felt about my gender, I have also been happier and more content in my life :)", "created_utc": 1698320824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gumdi/aita_for_wanting_to_wear_a_suit_to_my_sisters/", "score": 2385, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was not long after I had officially come out to my family as trans, and I was misgendered even more than usual all night. I sometimes, even now, will dress that way, but I do not ever dress that way around my family anymore because those who seem to \"try\" to use the correct names and pronouns immediately revert back to what they had previously always called me.

They hadn't seen him in years though, and he had a full beard and looked very manly. So he talked to his supportive sister/the bride and agreed it would be hilarious if he showed up in a frilly pink dress, chest hair and beard fully on display. And ofc their parents were pissed, even though he was doing the exact thing they asked for. \n\nPoint is, there's no pleasing transphobic parents.

It's not your parents' fault, that was the way it was done; doctors were gods and the public usually followed their commands. To be fair, the doctors didn't know the protocol was based on a bogus study by a Canadian doctor who \"accidentally\" castrated one twin boy, during a circumcision; and then had the boy raised as a girl alongside the brother, to prove nurture over nature. It's a tragic story.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Nature_Made_Him\n\nSo your parents had no evil intent, and they've probably been burying their feelings on the subject for your whole life.

But their expectations are so unlikely to be fulfilled they're kinda setting the kid up for failure, and themselves for disappointment. And again, from my perspective as a queer person it's bizarre to me that they can't seem to conceive any other path to happiness except the exact same one as them. My gay roommate had the same issue with his mom, a lovely, sweet lady, when he came out and later got married. She wasn't unkind or unsupportive, but she had a hard time accepting that he \"wasn't going to have a family\" (a husband, close friends and pets don't count) because she \"worried about his happiness.\" He was marrying a man he loved and couldn't be happier!

However, the percentage of gender non-conformity and transgender individuals in the intersex community matches the general population. There was a lot of not ok things that happened (and unfortunately still do) to make ambiguous genitalia more \"palatable\" but gender and sex are different and a lot of what is going on in this post is conflating intersex with gender fluid or trans. Many of the most common intersex conditions do not result in ambiguous genitalia or result in differences that may not be noticable at birth (CW >!small penises, large clitorises, and uncommon urethra placement are the most commonly seen differentiation in sex organs!<) and are only discovered later in life due to not hitting puberty or being infertile.\n\nThis link is a good glossary of conditions: https://interactadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Intersex-Variations-Glossary.pdf\n\nThis is a very personal issue for me. My little sister has Swyer Syndrome, she was born with all the external features of a baby girl but has XY chromosomes. She was raised as a girl because she was/is one. When she wasn't hitting puberty my parents took her to a doctor and they ran some hormone tests, discovered she was producing the right amount of precursor hormones for male puberty but not female puberty and that the hormones were not being transformed into male puberty hormones. So, further tests revealed that she had undifferentiated gonads(what both female and male fetuses have before sex differentiation in utero) instead of ovaries or testes.\n\nThe gonads could become cancerous so they were removed and she started taking estrogen to stimulate puberty and now just takes birth control to maintain her estrogen levels. She has a uterus and may be able to carry a child through IVF one day if she wants.\n\nShe is only a few years younger than you and was kept fully informed of what was happening the entire time.\n\nShe also joined a nationwide group (InterAct) in highschool. They are mostly compromised of individuals with intersex syndromes/conditions and do advocacy work. There are still too many cases of individuals that underwent unnecessary surgery before the age of consent, but it's becoming so much less common. But, my biggest issue with conflating intersex with gender is that the majority of intersex individuals identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. They view their hormone therapy (if it's necessary for their condition) the same as someone would view thyroid medication or maybe insulin. And, while they may do some introspection about gender or identity in general after their diagnosis, it doesn't usually end with them changing their identity.\n\nTo further demonstrate why this bugs me so much, I'm nonbinary, I don't like being assigned a gender at all. I don't have any conditions that would affect my hormones. My gender is completely different from my sex and so is my sister's. My little sister is soooo feminine and this stereotype that most or all intersex people experience gender dysphoria needs to stop. It makes it really hard for people who only view it as a medical condition to feel comfortable discussing it and it often also creates this idea that intersex individuals are inherently queer. My sister is NOT part of the queer community despite intersex individuals being lumped in due to very similar discrimination. We have had many discussions about whether we feel the \"I\" in LGBTQIA+ should be removed. Ultimately, we decided that intersex is still very misunderstood and unknown and being a part of a larger network of advocacy groups is good, but that we'd like to see society get to a place where it can be removed.\n\nYou can decide that the external/internal changes you are experiencing due to no longer taking hormone therapy better match your gender identity and you are so incredibly valid in feeling betrayed or hurt or furious that you were not given agency over your medical decisions. However, please try to keep the conversation about sex, gender, and potential medical abuse separate.\n\nTLDR: sex and gender are not the same.
