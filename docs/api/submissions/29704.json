{"id": 29704, "submission_id": "17gumdi", "title": "AITA for wanting to wear a suit to my sister's wedding", "selftext": "Throwaway account (also, still new to Reddit)\n\nBackstory: I (28 AFAB), was diagnosed with a \"hormone disorder\" when I was a young-ish teenager and was immediately put on hormone therapy for several years. That's meant that I developed pretty much a \"standard\" female body. Only when questioning my doctors later on did I find out that I could in fact be considered intersex. Tbh, it felt like the pieces suddenly clicked. I've stopped taking medication and developed both a bit of a beard and a much deeper voice - both of which I am happy about. I am looking into the possibility to also transition genders officially. I just do not feel like I am a woman (at all).\n\nNow, my sister is getting married next year and I have asked her if I could wear a suit to her wedding. At first, she was against it, but we sat down and talked and in the end, she told me that she would be happy to have me in a suit at her wedding. Her only stipulation was that it had to be \"a proper three piece\" - which I do in fact own already and am planning to wear.\n\nSince then, my parents found out and my mother has called repeatedly to tell me that I would be \"embarrassing\" them and that I should just keep it together (read: wear a ballgown) for the wedding. She also accused me of making my sister's day all about myself. My parents both made a point to remind me to \"shave in time for the wedding\".\n\nIn my mind, I still think that a suit would not be the end of the world and that it suits (sorry) me much better than dresses ever did. So, AITA?\n\nEdit (+typo fix): Thank you so much for all the comments, it's been kind of surreal. Since it's easier to address questions here - our relatives know about it and at least the ones in our generation are fine with it. I'm not doing a \"SURPRISE - Guess how long the beard has grown since you last saw me\" at the wedding. \n\nI'm also never going to look like \"a full man\". That ship has sailed (too much bosom which I am not willing to get surgically removed, too little beard to make a convincing sailor). I'll probably always look like someone in-between and that's fine by me. \n\nOn that note: Ever since I realized how I felt about my gender, I have also been happier and more content in my life :)", "created_utc": 1698320824, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17gumdi/aita_for_wanting_to_wear_a_suit_to_my_sisters/", "score": 642, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This was not long after I had officially come out to my family as trans, and I was misgendered even more than usual all night. I sometimes, even now, will dress that way, but I do not ever dress that way around my family anymore because those who seem to \"try\" to use the correct names and pronouns immediately revert back to what they had previously always called me.

They hadn't seen him in years though, and he had a full beard and looked very manly.

It's not your parents' fault, that was the way it was done; doctors were gods and the public usually followed their commands. To be fair, the doctors didn't know the protocol was based on a bogus study by a Canadian doctor who \"accidentally\" castrated one twin boy, during a circumcision; and then had the boy raised as a girl alongside the brother, to prove nurture over nature. It's a tragic story.\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Nature_Made_Him\n\nSo your parents had no evil intent, and they've probably been burying their feelings on the subject for your whole life.

But their expectations are so unlikely to be fulfilled they're kinda setting the kid up for failure, and themselves for disappointment. And again, from my perspective as a queer person it's bizarre to me that they can't seem to conceive any other path to happiness except the exact same one as them. My gay roommate had the same issue with his mom, a lovely, sweet lady, when he came out and later got married. She wasn't unkind or unsupportive, but she had a hard time accepting that he \"wasn't going to have a family\" (a husband, close friends and pets don't count) because she \"worried about his happiness.\" He was marrying a man he loved and couldn't be happier!
