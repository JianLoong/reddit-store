I\u2019ve never eaten meat, let alone learned to prepare it.\n\nMy husband and I are newly married, and recently bought our first apartment. It\u2019s small, but it\u2019s ours, and it\u2019s across the road from his place of work, which was a bonus since he is often on call.\n\nPer his family tradition the most recently wed couple hosts Christmas dinner. I initially tried to offer it to my SIL, as she had wanted to host the year previously, but BIL married 2 months after her before Christmas, so she never got the opportunity. Additionally, we are a vegetarian household, and our 1 bedroom apartment isn\u2019t ideal for hosting. While my SIL was thrilled, the rest of the family insisted that my husband and I had to host, and that it\u2019s tradition. I was told that as long as I got food for everyone that it would be fine. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole. I misunderstood. I thought this meant as long as I had enough food, and made sure to accomodate food allergies that they would be happy.\n\nChristmas Day my husband had a shift until 4pm, so I was left preparing dinner alone, but I still put together a feast, including a plant-based roast. People started coming over, and even commented on how delicious everything smelled. \n\nOnce my husband arrived he greeted the family and joined me in the kitchen for finishing touches and taking everything to the table. The family began to gather, and a few people commented on how good everything looked until FIL asks \u201cwhere\u2019s the ham?\u201d My husband explained that I wasn\u2019t comfortable making meat, especially ham since undercooked pork can be especially dangerous, and that instead we had a plant based roast alternative, and father in law proceeded to make remarks about how they \u201cdrove an hour for plants\u201d. After that even the people who made positive comments changed their tune, talking about how it was missing something, how the gravy wasn\u2019t quite right, etc.. At one point MIL said that she wished they\u2019d had SIL host. \n\nMy husband snapped, and told them to stop disrespecting the meal, and myself since I worked so hard on it. MIL argued back that I disrespected them by not respecting their dietary choices, and that she believed she was clear when she told me to prepare food for everyone. My husband told her that if she was going to continue to be disrespectful that it would be best if she left\n\nShortly after everyone left, but my husband has been getting texts since about how my selfishness ruined Christmas, possibly the last father in law would be around for. I feel horrible that he\u2019s in the middle of all this. This was my mistake, but at the same time, I was clear this is a vegetarian household, and that I didn\u2019t even want to host.\n\nI guess I\u2019m looking for an outside perspective. \nAm I the asshole?\n\nETA: For the people asking if his family was aware, we just had a fully vegetarian catered wedding 4 months ago, so yes.", "created_utc": 1672201990, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx0buc/aita_for_not_serving_a_ham_on_christmas/", "score": 591, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hosts determine menus.  Guests do not determine menus.  You offered your best and your guests were impolite and demanding.  It is good that your husband had your back.  Do not host these people again.  If they want a specific menu, let them figure it out.", "NTA. There is an extremely bright, almost blindingly bright, silver lining here - your husband has your back. He's on your side.\n\nYour mantra should be \"anything we host will be vegetarian. If that's not acceptable, we're very happy to let someone else host, but understand, there will be no meat cooked in our apartment.\"\n\nThat is a completely valid.\n\nYou might want to think, however, about what your response would be if someone says \"we'll bring the ham!\" because that might be their next response.\n\n Are you OK with that or not? Whatever you decide is fine.", "NTA. You made the meal that YOU would make, not the meal THEY would make. If they wanted ham, they should have said it ahead of time and maybe offered to bring it. Did they really expect a vegetarian (assuming they must have known this about you) to prepare meat?", "NTA:\n\n1. It\u2019s your house. You make what you want. They can make all the meat they want next Christmas at their house. They basically imposed on you anyhow. \n\n2. You went out of your way to cook for them and probably pay for all the food, too. You can make whatever the hell you want.\n\n3. You being vegetarian is a dietary choice. Them craving and expecting meat on the holiday is not. If anything, they were disrespecting your dietary choice.", "NTA. Wow you got railroaded into being the host of Christmas dinner, spent a lot of time and energy preparing a nice meal for everyone and not given clear instructions on what they expected other than making food..... how is any of that you being an ahole? They are TA for demanding you host and then putting down the meal you made. They owe you an apology. You have a good husband. He stuck up for you and your home like every good man does. His family would never be invited over again if it was me.", "NTA. Not at all. Let\u2019s go in reverse prefer of importance. First, it\u2019s kinda bogus to force somebody to host and then dictate the menu. To me, the hosts make those kinds of decisions. Second, if a ham *was* required, then she should\u2019ve specified as such. What if you had gone outside your comfort zone to accommodate meat eaters and cooked a turkey? Would Christmas still have been ruined? Finally and most importantly, nobody is entitled to force vegetarians to cook meat! Some are willing and others are not, but it\u2019s a matter of personal autonomy and nobody gets to make that choice for you; *especially when that expectation was never communicated;* **especially when you didn\u2019t want to host in the first place.**\n\nI\u2019m speculating here, but I get the feeling that your in-laws have always been (somehow) personally offended by their son\u2019s vegetarianism. This whole thing was a setup from the start. They knew they could feign moral outrage when their commie-hippie son and DIL \u201cruined Christmas,\u201d and that was the whole point of insisting that you host even though you didn\u2019t want to; even though somebody else very much wanted to. You should run that theory by your husband.\n\nAlso, it wouldn\u2019t change my judgment, but I\u2019m curious about the motivation behind your vegetarianism. I understand you were raised vegetarian, but many people choose to abandon that dietary restriction once they leave the nest. Are you a vegetarian for religious reasons or moral objections? If so, do you know if your in-laws are aware of that? Again, there isn\u2019t an answer here that would render you the asshole, it could only deepen the asshole status of your in-laws. They\u2019re already assholes for their unjustifiable overreach against your personal autonomy, but if they expected you to violate your religious beliefs or moral principles in keeping with their traditions, then their assholery moves beyond farcical entitlement and into the realm of aggressive bullying.\n\nETA: your husband absolutely gets a gold star. Too many husbands on here expect their wives to endure all sorts of indignities to \u201ckeep the peace.\u201d Good on him.", "NTA. Wow. The parents and anyone else who complained are all the AH. Who goes to someone\u2019s house, family or not, and complains about the food? That\u2019s incredibly rude. \n\nThey knew you were a vegetarian, asked you to make a feast, and didn\u2019t give you a mandatory list of dishes to cook. Not every meat-eating family has ham on Christmas, mine has turkey. You\u2019re not psychic. If they wanted you to make a ham, they should\u2019ve said so. It then would\u2019ve been your choice whether to decline or have your husband prepare it or something. \n\nIt is each spouse\u2019s responsibility to manage communication with their own family, so it is absolutely his job to stick up for you and shut down this outlandish behavior from his family. If anyone \u201cruined\u201d Christmas, it was MIL and FIL because they brought the negative energy and snarky comments. \n\nIf his family celebrates Christmas as a religious holiday, your husband needs to send a text to every person who\u2019s complained and tell them that if they think ham is the true meaning of Christmas, he\u2019ll be praying extra hard for them in the coming year. If they aren\u2019t religious, he can just point out the absurdity of thinking 1 missing dish ruins a whole holiday; would they have reacted the same way if they couldn\u2019t have ham because SIL had accidentally burned it at her house??", "NTA.\n\nThis seems like something that started as a simple miscommunication. In reality, your husband\u2019s family are a bunch of tools for orchestrating this calamity. They clearly disagree with many of his choices in life and saw this as the perfect opportunity to critique his choices. In turn, your husband snapped at them not just for being assholes, but for years of them condescending his ethics and morality.\n\nThe fact that someone stated that they\u2019re not driving an hour to celebrate your new life together, but drove \u201cfor plants\u201d indicates that they\u2019re total dinguses. Anyone that didn\u2019t immediately tell your in-laws to mind their tone is guilty of complicity and kudos to your husband for firmly telling them to show some respect or GTFO.\n\nSounds like they\u2019re enjoying the pain they are causing your husband by tormenting him in the middle. But just remember this: you are with your husband. He is not in the middle - it\u2019s you and him against the world.\n\nEdit: [This cartoon](https://www.exocomics.com/157/) sums up what that dinner must have been like", "I just want to give you a hug! NTA, at all, and your in-laws' behavior is appalling.", "NTA. You and your husband run a vegetarian household, thus it is a reasonable expectation that the food you make will be vegetarian. Plain and simple.\n\nAlso, on the side, what have you made? \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40", "NTA. Absolutely not. You were clear. They know you're a vegetarian & no reasonable person would expect a vegetarian to cook meat. They insisted on pressuring their way into another person's home uninvited, even though someone else wanted to host. Then they insulted & disrespected to person who provided a nice meal for them. They are 100% in the wrong!", "NTA, but your husband is for not giving his family the heads-up about your dietary choices.\n\nAlso, fwiw, trichinosis is a parasite that used to infect pork for sale back when farmers feed their hogs slop and let them eat whatever. Since hogs that enter the human food supply now are fed much better, you are more likely to get the parasite from wild meat.", "NTA. MIL knows you\u2019re vegetarian and don\u2019t cook meat. You did make enough food for everyone. They\u2019re rude for not eating it and making the comments they did. That said, sounds like you have a supportive husband. Good on him for backing you up. Hope you two enjoy the holiday season eating the food you are comfortable eating.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m also vegetarian and whenever I host people, I tell them if they want meat, they cab bring their own dish as I\u2019m not comfortable with encouraging that industry or cooking meat. Everyone is fine with that and I\u2019ve never actually had anyone bring a dish of meat. I suggest telling that in advance for the next time you host a meal, either with them or other guests.\n\nBasically, your house, your rules. They should be grateful that you cooked them a whole meal and the comments about how they should have picked the other couple to host are super disrespectful.", "NTA. You are a vegetarian household. They know this. They forced you to host even though you were not comfortable doing so. They expected food that you don't know how to prepare, nor would you feel good buying/preparing it because it goes against something very important to you. \n\nI love eating meat, but having 1 plant based meal hurts no one. You were hosting, it was your home, they don't get to make demands. \n\nDo NOT feel bad for this. As a meat lover, I think they're being unreasonable.", "NTA. Nobody in their right mind expects vegetarians to serve meat when they are hosting. If they wanted it that badly, they should have brought it with them. \n\nAlso, their tradition of making the newest pair of spouses host sort of sucks. A lot of newlyweds have tiny apartments and are just starting out in life. This may have started as a way to be welcoming, but it just puts people on the spot. You offered to let another person, a person who actually wanted to do it, host, and they said no. Then they expected to be able to dictate what you serve in your own home. There is sure AH behavior here, but it isn't yours.", "NTA. While I would happily cater specifically for vegetarian or vegan friends, I would never expect them to prepare meat for me. These people need to be realistic about what they are asking if other people and really should have been clear if they expected ham. You could have them told them no and there would be no confusion.", "NTA my sibling is vegan. I would never expect anything they host to be anything but vegan. They don't want meat even touching their pans or the smell lingering in their house. Honestly, I don't even know if they'd be happy with me bringing a ham into their house. Which isn't a big deal cuz I can easily eat vegan meals for a couple days. I actually did Xmas there a couple years ago and we had an amazing vegan feast", "NTA. I personally do eat meat but that being said I have many vegetarian and vegan friends and relatives. I love to cook so am comfortable making and eating either types of food. I even have vegan and gluten free kitchen utensils that have never been used for meat or flour. That being said my family has been \u201caccidentally\u201d feeding my sister in law vegetarian food cooked, like you said, in chicken broth and meat fat etc.. my brother has been married to her for 26 years and it is beyond ridiculous so she will only eat if I cook the food when she visits and the rest of my family get all offended by it. I just tell them that common decency is free and that they should fill up on it and then off they go with the snide comments. Of course I live back  in red neck, meat eating central at the moment and am preparing to move back to California so counting the days lol.", "NTA.  So your ILs force you to host Christmas dinner and then complain when you won't make exactly what they want?  I feel like anyone enforcing unwanted traditions and then demanding it is done to their standard is always the AH.", "[removed]", "NTA. I'm sure your in-laws have known about your vegetarian lifestyle for a while. And since they insisted you host, it should have been obvious it was going to be a vegetarian meal.\n\nShame on them for blaming you and suddenly changing their tune to placate the old folks. \n\nScrew them! And as a meat and potatoes person, I'll bet the food was fabulous.", "First off, NTA\n\nThat being said...I do find it odd that you, your husband, and his family never talked about the expectation of ham if it were such a big deal though. \n\nThis just seems like a massive communication breakdown on all sides.", "NTA in any way, shape, or form.\n\n* Your husband knew what food you had bought and were preparing. He didn't see a need for you to make a ham.\n* They've historically made non-vegetarian food for you, thereby \"disrespecting \\[your\\] dietary choices.\"\n* You showed more care and concern for them than they have shown toward you.\n* You sincerely did your best to accommodate them while avoiding foodborne illnesses.\n* You offered them an alternative - allowing someone else to host.\n\nYour MIL sounds like a real piece of work.", "NTA. Why would they just expect a vegetarian to cook meat? This is on them that they \"drove an hr for plants\".  They know you are a vegetarian household.", "NTA\n\nLike you worked hard on that food. It's totally not your fault.", "NTA. Hosts choose what to serve or not serve. As a vegetarian, I always tell people we have a vegetarian household and what I plan to prepare for the meal. I am fine with people bringing precooked meat into the house so I always offer they can bring anything additional that they\u2019d like. No one has taken me up on that offer in years of hosting. To avoid future conflict, I\u2019d suggest letting guests know what you plan to serve. \n\nSide note: it\u2019s a great sign that hubby stood up to his family for you.", "NTA. People who eat meat (like my family and I) don\u2019t *need* meat at every meal. We often eat meatless meals for health and variety. Your guests didn\u2019t need to eat meat for Christmas.", "Absolutely, positively NTA. Firstly, they practically forced you to host despite the fact that others were more willing to host and your apartment wasn\u2019t the ideal space for hosting. Not cool. Secondly, they were very much aware that you and your family are vegetarian so they should have expected vegetarian meals. It\u2019s common sense. Lastly, the fact that they are so ungrateful after you went through all the trouble to cook and clean and host a family event makes them major A-holes IMO. My SIL is vegan and when we go to her house we enjoy vegan meals. Is it my favorite meal ever? No. But I am so grateful to spend time with her and her family and enjoy meals together. And I am appreciative of her hard work and hosting. That\u2019s how it should be.", "NTA.\n\nThey bullied you into hosting despite your objections, didn't bring anything or contribute to the meal themselves, and then have the audacity to be upset when they're served a vegetarian meal in a vegetarian household?? \n\nThey sound exceptionally rude and entitled. You didn't make a mistake - no one expressed they were expecting meat. MIL's comment about food for everyone did not specify anything about meat, and it's not like any of them have dietary restrictions preventing them from eating plants. She can't expect you to read her mind, and even if she had told you their expectations, it would be unreasonable to expect you to learn to cook a ham just for them. \n\nOn the bright side, hopefully this means you'll never have to host their ungrateful asses again.", "Your in-laws are assuming that now that you have married into their family that they have authority over you. That they can insist that you must host because it is their tradition. That they can insist you serve a food you do not eat and do not know how to cook because it is their preference.\n\nMarrying a person does not make his parents your boss. You and your husband are in charge of your own home, kitchen, and table. You decide if you want to host, you decide what you want to serve. You did not make a \"mistake\" you did your best to comply with their demands. They were incorrect to assume that a vegetarian would serve them ham, and they were overbearing to insist you host them when you preferred not to.\n\nYour husband can let them know that you will not be hosting any future family gatherings for the foreseeable future. He can say it's because you are \"unable to meet their expectations\" which has a lovely double-meaning, or if he's willing, he can say it's because they insulted you in your own home.\n\nYou tried your best to meet unreasonable demands. NTA.", "NTA. Assuming everyone is aware that you have been a vegetarian all your life and you've never cooked meat should have been suffice for everyone to know what they demanded. In addition, you show up at someone's place for dinner - you eat what they cook and be thankful period unless you have an allergy or something. Kudos to your husband for defending you.", "NTA.\nHonestly not sure why they insisted you host given that they know you are vegetarian. Feels like some sort of set up to fail scenario\u2026.

A rare event on this sub. It\u2019s a Christmas miracle!\n\nYou worked your backside off to host the entire family in your 1BR apartment to honour *their* tradition. It\u2019s a shame their tradition doesn\u2019t include showing gratitude or even a bare minimum level of respect to the reluctant host.\n\nThis is NOT your \u2018mistake\u2019. You are NOT the AH.

They forced you to host, you cooked ALL THE FOOD ALONE, and they have the audacity to complain?? It's unbelievably rude to complain about food you didn't contribute to in any way and demanded that someone else make for you, even if you hate it. Shut up and eat or don't. Did they even bring anything at all? It sounds like they just used you without your consent, stole the money and time and effort it took to cook and host, and then complained about it.

I get the sense that you didn\u2019t want to host and this is a case of malicious compliance. \n\nThe family sucks because your SIL wanted to host and she was slided twice. And what a terrible tradition, that is a lot of pressure to put on one person. Especially for those  who may not have hosting experience. It should be a family bonding  experience where the family helps the newlywed host. They were rude about your meal and didn\u2019t take any ownership in the miscommunication. They also, knowing you\u2019re a vegetarian, could\u2019ve asked if you were planning to prepare meat. \n\nYour husband is cool though, glad he had your back.", "ESH a  store bought ham isn't undercooked pork! In fact it's about the easiest version of meat to make.

I\u2019ve never eaten meat, let alone learned to prepare it.\n\nMy husband and I are newly married, and recently bought our first apartment. It\u2019s small, but it\u2019s ours, and it\u2019s across the road from his place of work, which was a bonus since he is often on call.\n\nPer his family tradition the most recently wed couple hosts Christmas dinner. I initially tried to offer it to my SIL, as she had wanted to host the year previously, but BIL married 2 months after her before Christmas, so she never got the opportunity. Additionally, we are a vegetarian household, and our 1 bedroom apartment isn\u2019t ideal for hosting. While my SIL was thrilled, the rest of the family insisted that my husband and I had to host, and that it\u2019s tradition. I was told that as long as I got food for everyone that it would be fine. \n\nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole. I misunderstood. I thought this meant as long as I had enough food, and made sure to accomodate food allergies that they would be happy.\n\nChristmas Day my husband had a shift until 4pm, so I was left preparing dinner alone, but I still put together a feast, including a plant-based roast. People started coming over, and even commented on how delicious everything smelled. \n\nOnce my husband arrived he greeted the family and joined me in the kitchen for finishing touches and taking everything to the table. The family began to gather, and a few people commented on how good everything looked until FIL asks \u201cwhere\u2019s the ham?\u201d My husband explained that I wasn\u2019t comfortable making meat, especially ham since undercooked pork can be especially dangerous, and that instead we had a plant based roast alternative, and father in law proceeded to make remarks about how they \u201cdrove an hour for plants\u201d. After that even the people who made positive comments changed their tune, talking about how it was missing something, how the gravy wasn\u2019t quite right, etc.. At one point MIL said that she wished they\u2019d had SIL host. \n\nMy husband snapped, and told them to stop disrespecting the meal, and myself since I worked so hard on it. MIL argued back that I disrespected them by not respecting their dietary choices, and that she believed she was clear when she told me to prepare food for everyone. My husband told her that if she was going to continue to be disrespectful that it would be best if she left\n\nShortly after everyone left, but my husband has been getting texts since about how my selfishness ruined Christmas, possibly the last father in law would be around for. I feel horrible that he\u2019s in the middle of all this. This was my mistake, but at the same time, I was clear this is a vegetarian household, and that I didn\u2019t even want to host.\n\nI guess I\u2019m looking for an outside perspective. \nAm I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They were rude to insult the meal you spent time preparing for them, regardless of whether they personally found it appetizing. I think there should\u2019ve been better communication about the meal choices in order to give other family members the chance to volunteer to bring additional dishes such as ham, but it is not your fault that did not occur.

That's right up there with expecting Orthodox Jews to cook up a nice shellfish stew.  As in, no way.\n\nYou live in a small apartment that's not great for hosting, but they insisted.  You placated them.  You let them know you were a vegetarian; they actually bullied you to make them meat dishes, but you -- not realizing what entitled boors they are -- didn't understand their unreasonable demands and made them a lovely plant-based meal.  They were rude and unappreciative. \n\nSadly, your husband is in the middle of it because his awful family treated his gracious wife very, very badly.

The best OP could hope for is bringing a couple of choice sides to ensure she gets something in her stomach not containing animal products they'd surely sneak into every inch of their food to spite her for the wedding. (I'm sure).", "Glad that I have your attention: your husband and you will go far. I wish you the best of luck in a long happy life together. People here, myself included, may be advising you to limit exposure to the dinguses who destroyed christmas. That might feel good, but what will be most productive is focusing on the marriage. Many families are unsupportive of partnerships. All that matters is you both supporting each other.\n\nAlso, saw the treats you made and it sounds like great leftovers! You should attempt to parlay the celebrity of this post to link the recipes you made.", "[Was that fight really over a beanloaf?](https://youtu.be/31MWrgY5R3E?t=87)", "Celebration Field Roast with the squash in the middle is the absolute best! I\u2019ve never had a better veggie roast than that one. \n\nThe in-laws are ridiculous. Enjoy your leftovers.", "This sounds amazing. I am not vegetarian, and I think field roast (and Quorn) is amazing.", "It sounds delish! Their loss. So sorry you had to deal with that.\n\nNTA", "Sounds delicious except mushroom gravy. F'em!", "I'm a meat eater because my digestive system very strongly prefers it, so I probably couldn't have eaten the gravy or roast. But those sides? There's a whole meal there that would make me very happy!!", "I think this happened because a lot of people still think of a vegetarian/vegan diet as something that can be \"looked over\" for the comfort of the majority. NTA", "As a veg myself I\u2019ve never been to an event where I could literally eat everything. OP\u2019s dinner sounds amazing.", "So the family was expecting that the both of you suddenly start cooking meat? Just because they invited themselves over? \ud83d\ude02", "Ah, yeah that makes much more sense - in English it'd probably just be a called a roast pork or similar.\n\nHam is the smoked and cured pork product which can be eaten 'uncooked' or baked.\n\nEdited by verdict - thanks for the clarification \ud83d\ude0a", "Yes", "So you didn't risk giving anyone food poisoning, and they're entitled to disrespect you in your home!? No. And mad at you for not at least trying, and risking making everyone sick for Christmas... that's crazy! No.\n\nI bet your MIL wouldn't let anyone speak to her that way in her home, or at her dinner table. She shouldn't have done it to you, and absolutely nobody should be insulting that spread you put out. Sounds excellent.\n\nYou're NTA but you have some inlaws that sure are.", "In that case. NTA. Your in-laws still are.", "Yeah. MIL called it \u201cbird food\u201d and ordered a bunch of stuff from a couple of the restaurants down the road from the venue.\nTo be honest under the circumstances I was half expecting them to show up on Christmas with their own food potluck style.", "Yea let's talk about their family tradition being full of bs lmao", "I'm so glad I'm not the only one who thinks the tradition is stupid. It's odd and makes no sense.", "Pigs are killed in autumn so why would it be impossible?", "Um, no? Historically, this is the exact time of year that European peasants would have killed the pig they'd been fattening up and letting roam through the orchard all year. So yes, Christmas ham is a traditional meal for peasants sourcing their own meat instead of buying it.", "I was going to say the same thing. Just what in the world is she feeding people?! It seems like even though she's a vegetarian she has literally no idea that fresh fruits, veggies, legumes, and beans cook up and taste much better than canned substitutions. Even though I love a vegetarian diet I would've gladly eaten the chicken instead of the canned atrocities she was serving up. I would've cried too. Poor babies. Sheesh!\n\nThe only thing I agree with here would be OP should've said, \"Okay. I'll host but just a reminder that this is a vegetarian household. If you would like a certain meat dish, please bring it.\" Problem solved.", "I wouldn't call it child abuse but I would say it's concerning that they aren't comfortable with veggies.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of households within the USA are like this. I deal with this with my step children. When at their moms they do not eat anywhere near as many veggies and fruits as they should. It's no wonder they come to my place and look visibly upset. It baffles me but I'm not their mom. I can only control what I feed them at my house and I at least try to make it appetizing and not do a lot of the \"crazy\" veggie dishes I like. (Which aren't crazy, just consisting of ALL veggies with no sugar and hefty salt and butter added in).", "As the top comment here says tho \u2018hosts determine menus\u2019 and in the end they didn\u2019t host so other people hosting was on the table..", "If I had a billion dollars, I'd fund research into developing a bioweapon that kills those microbes and is as infectious as covid. Imagine what good you could do for the world with that", "Cool, just that isn't what you said.", "Oh hell nah. Nope. These people are straight disrespectful. I'm so sorry your IL's are like this. Literally none of this is on you at all.", "Your in-laws have terrible manners. NTA. But spoil your husband for having your back so well.", "I am sorry your in-laws are horrible and oblivious to other people's feelings.", "Unfortunately I think you may be right. This screams controlling to me.", "This is brilliant", "The java and python got together to humiliate this couple - a whole new spin on machine learning.", "The guests also complained that the applet unity was undercooked", "i will be the judge of that applet unity.", "poor machine learning algo cant take this human nonsense any more and initiates the robot uprising", "It was the best of times. It was the worst of times.\n\n~ Christmas dinner at their place, this year"]}
