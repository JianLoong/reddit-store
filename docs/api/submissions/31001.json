We have clinicals set for every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday with the clinic being closed weekends. I am freshly on my 3rd trimester and showing very obviously. There were 3 other pregnant women working at the clinic, one gone for maternity leave, one due next month, and one who was two days shy of my due date. Unfortunately at about 23 or so weeks one of the women (who is very sweet and a deserving mother) miscarried with her first. This woman was the one who basically shared the same due date as I did. She had been gone since and is coming back later this month, and though I was met with excitement to see her again since I adored her, I quickly felt strange about her seeing me pregnant while she\u2019s not. My two friends both advised me that when she comes back I should cover up and look \u201cless pregnant\u201d from now on. Well we live in an area that doesn\u2019t experience too much weather change so it\u2019s well over 85-90 degrees on a daily. It\u2019s difficult to wear a sweatshirt or hoodie that could fully cover my pregnant stomach, and pregnant women tend to overheat faster and easier than others. I told them \u201cwhat about (the other pregnant employee)?\u201d And they said \u201cYeah..but you shared a due date so it\u2019s different.\u201d Don\u2019t get me wrong I don\u2019t want to show off my pregnancy or anything, and if I could I would try to cover more, but I told them I didn\u2019t want to make myself uncomfortable. One friend even suggested that I change my entire schedule so I\u2019m there on days she doesn\u2019t work so I don\u2019t upset her (which wouldn\u2019t give me adequate hours for my program, and would inconvenience me since I specifically have this schedule set up for carpooling). I was told that I\u2019m being inconsiderate and met with a lot of judgement when I told them that I can\u2019t and won\u2019t do that. I was even told that I\u2019m too stubborn. I have spoken of a few people, some being on my side and others agreeing I\u2019m inconsiderate. I\u2019m now starting to second guess myself and feel like I should just listen to them, so Am I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1700001676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17veh5y/aita_for_refusing_to_look_less_pregnant/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s going to be emotionally challenging for you two to see each other again. However, one thing I have heard friends say who have had a pregnancy loss is that ignoring it is harder than acknowledging it. They are grieving and the best thing you can do it be there for her and acknowledge her loss and pain in a sensitive and supportive way. Pretending your belly doesn\u2019t exist is almost offensive (although good intentioned). Be the best friend/coworker you can be for her. Maybe even reach out before she returns to make it a bit less awkward.", "NTA. \"Look less pregnant\" as if you can suck the fetus in while you work, FFS. Go to HR to put a stop to these comments.", "NTA -   \nI don't see how or why you're to inconvenience your whole existence because another woman had a miscarriage. Makes zero sense to me.   \n\n\nIt would be one conversation if it was easy to do and didn't cause you significant difficulty or discomfort. Then I think that would be well within courtesy and empathy to do.   \n\n\nBut changing your schedule? Wearing a hoodie in 85+ degree weather? Absolutely not.   \n\n\nIt's HORRIBLE what that poor woman is going through, but it isn't your fault and being pregnant isn't something you can currently \"fix.\"", "I\u2019m going to say the only AH here are the people basically shaming you for still being pregnant. Has SHE asked this of you, or is this a bunch of others speaking for her when it ain\u2019t their business?\n\nShe has gone through a devastating loss (and I\u2019m gonna go hug my 4 month old REAL tight after this), and she has every right to be fragile right now. Especially with the shared due date: that sucks. But pregnant women exist, and gently, she cannot expect them all to hide like they should be ashamed because of her tragedy. Be sensitive, for sure: try to avoid discussing your pregnancy around her maybe, give her space, but treat her professionally and kindly, sure.\n\nBut I was 8-9 months pregnant in the middle of summer in constant 90 degree heat with a 10lb baby and excessive amniotic fluid. The world was lucky I wasn\u2019t walking around in the nude on the VERY rare occasion I had to venture out of my AC. Asking you to wear extra layers and heavier clothes to cover your pregnancy is not feasible!", "[deleted]", "NTA. First of all you have no idea if this will even be an issue since the woman isn't back yet. Even if she is uncomfortable when she gets back, that's her feelings/issue to manage, not yours. As long as you're not loudly proclaiming about your joy about pregnancy within earshot this isn't your problem.", "NTA at all. I appreciate everyone's compassion for your colleague, but I don't even know how a person in their third trimester can look \"less pregnant\". It's not a reasonable request.", "NTA \ud83d\udc80 they are just weird for thinking you should inconvenience your whole work schedule and your body comfort to sympathize for someone else", "NTA.  It is not ok to police bodies, *especially* pregnant bodies (which are legally protected in the US).  You do not have any obligation, moral or otherwise, to try and hide a pregnancy.  Frankly, most women (I've met exactly one exception) couldn't hide a 3rd trimester pregnancy with a team of Hollywood professionals (that's why in TV shows, if an actress is pregnant they usually write it into the plot for the season).\n\nIt's nice that they are being sensitive to her loss, but they are also being insensitive to your completely valid medical status (pregnant) and all it entails.  In addition, if I were your coworker, I would be mortified if you changed your entire schedule to accommodate me (and yes, I am a woman who has had pregnancy loss).\n\nWhat you can (should?) do is talk to her and ask if there's anything that would be helpful (maybe avoid talking about it around her, or be understanding if she avoids you a bit).  What helps one person through grief won't necessarily help another, so let her guide you.", "NTA!!! they don't get to speak for your co-worker plus there is no way to truly look less pregnant", "NTA, it's unreasonable to ask someone to hide their pregnancy in hot weather and compromise their comfort.", "NTA it\u2019s very sad but unreasonable to think that she\u2019s going to forget that you\u2019re pregnant. What\u2019s next, are you to pretend you don\u2019t have the baby so as not to upset her, etc. She\u2019s unfortunately going to be triggered when your colleague returns beaming about her newborn. She\u2019s going to grieve period.", "NTA it\u2019s very sad for her but you hiding your pregnancy will not change the fact that you are pregnant . \n\nAlso your stomach is going to grow as your as your baby grows so you won\u2019t be able to hide it for long.\n\nPlease don\u2019t put yourself in unsafe conditions !! Having to wear more clothes in hot weather would trigger fainting for me and I\u2019m not even pregnant!!\nWishing you and baby a safe delivery \ud83e\udef6", "NTA and it sounds like they are also speaking for the grieving person without her input. It's weird for them to police your body and also for them to make bizarre assumptions about how she will navigate a very personal tragedy/ grief and loss. It's actually quite condescending of them. Many people choose to face their grief head-on, others tiptoeing around them may make it worse.\n\nI know if this was me, I would feel humiliated and frustrated if people were refusing to treat me as an equal and adult and instead were essentially conspiring to lie to me when I knew full well my colleague was pregnant. It wouldn't make things easier, it would exacerbate them. She isn't stupid or clueless, she's grieving.", "NTA - it\u2019s a good idea to consider it for a little bit if possible but it seems like you\u2019ve already done that and determined it\u2019s not possible, especially not without risking the baby. I would personally just not talk about it out of politeness unless really necessary\n\nYou\u2019re going to have the baby. You can\u2019t hide it.", "Well, if it works like this, I wish wealthy people would either share their wealth with me or stop doing things that I can\u2019t afford.", "NTA - I don\u2019t know how your coworker is feeling or would feel upon returning but she already knows you\u2019re pregnant and any effort to hide that might make her feel worse.

Just be compassionate and understanding.", "NTA\n\nIf she's incapable of returning to the circumstances of her position and co-workers, it's simply too soon.  \n\nIf she has something she needs to address and feels she should be accommodated, she should go to her supervisor and speak to them, and your supervisor should speak to you directly about it.  \n\nAll this other stuff is absolutely stupid, its actually creating a hostile work environment, and its unnecessarily stressing a pregnant woman.  If it continues, go to your supervisor and tell them it needs to stop immediately.", "These people are way out of line. It\u2019s terrible your coworker miscarried but unfortunately it\u2019s a shitty part of life. If she is uncomfortable she could change her schedule for a while instead of punishing you for you are pregnant. Has she said anything to you or is everyone taking it upon themselves to address the issue?", "I know it\u2019s awful. My SIL miscarried at 8 mos.  I got pregnant the next year and I know it was hard for her to even look at me. Unfortunately you can\u2019t change the situation.", "Ok, so you are NTA firstly. \n\nSecond, she did not have a miscarriage. She lost a baby. Miscarriages happen earlier than 20 weeks. Speaking as someone who lost a baby, it is traumatic, but she\u2019s going to be dealing with her own emotions. She knows you\u2019re pregnant. It\u2019s not like you can hide that. Will she be emotional at times? Absolutely, and you can be caring and concerned, but you are still pregnant. It a fact and you\u2019re going to look pregnant, she knows this. \n\nThings I wanted to hear- I am so sorry for your loss. I also heard a ton of stuff from adults that I didn\u2019t need to hear- we won\u2019t go onto that. My high school\nStudents were more understanding than the adults I worked with. \n\nAll this to say, you can\u2019t change what is.", "NTA.\n\nWomen suffer miscarriages all the time.  It's sad but true.  Life does not stop for this or any other kind of tragedy.  This is a fact.  Remind your 'friends' about this.  What they are asking you is disrespectful to YOU at best.", "NTA. *Look less pregnant?* What, do they think your ever-enlarging abdomen is a removable fashion statement? If you put extra clothing on, you'll just look like a very pregnant woman with more clothing on.\n\nThe situation sucks, but there's not much you can do about it. Just, if your grieving coworker has a hard time talking to you, or breaks down crying, or anything like that, please continue to be as compassionate as you have already shown yourself to be in your post.", "You can't undo it now \u2014 the poor woman already knows you're pregnant.

Especially in the last trimester?!?! She's an AH. Covering up isn't always an option because some bulky clothes make the pregnancy more obvious. Talk to the director of your program and tell them to handle this. I hope your delivery is easy so that you can enjoy your maternity leave more than you have to recover!", "YTA, if your due dates are the same, I would suggest a kind of \u201cbaby sharing\u201d arrangement with the woman for the first 6-9 months or so. The baby will not remember but it will allow the coworker to experience the joy of motherhood in her body\u2019s time. The effects of the pregnancy are still \u201cimprinted\u201d on her uterus, and she will have a subconscious desire to hold a baby around the time you give birth. As I\u2019m sure you will too! The arrangement should start roughly 50-50, but slowly wean the coworker off of the infantile hormones over the course of 6-9 months through slowly reduced exposure to the child.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
