All of the wedding planning has gone great so far, until a couple of weeks ago. We are both fairly frugal, so we planned to cut excess wedding expenses as much as possible. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, my fianc\u00e9 came downstairs after talking on the phone with his older sister and told me \u201chow excited she was to be a bridesmaid.\u201d I hadn\u2019t asked her to be my bridesmaid, and I\u2019m not planning on having any bridesmaids/MOH, so I assumed they were referring to another friend of hers or something. Slowly, I realized that she had been talking about our wedding. I quickly corrected my fianc\u00e9, explaining that she wasn\u2019t going to be my bridesmaid, since I wasn\u2019t having any.\n\nHe got upset (which is out of character) and said I was being silly. He told me that it would be weird for me to not have any bridesmaids, mean to his sister to be left out of our ceremony, and unfair because he was planning on having nine groomsmen (the first I heard of this). I countered with my reasoning, explaining that I am trying to save money by not having bridesmaids and more importantly, I don\u2019t have enough friends to be bridesmaids. The only people I could think of would be my sister and his, and having two bridesmaids that were from our families would make me look sad.\n\nWe took a break on the argument for the rest of the evening, but it came back up the next morning. He argued that it\u2019s his sister, and if he wants her in the wedding she should be in it. I agreed, and said she could be part of his wedding party if he wanted. I don\u2019t have any brothers, so it\u2019s not like my sibling is one of his groomsmen. He then continued to point out that it would be weird for him to have groomsmen when I don\u2019t have anyone on my side of the aisle. He said that to not make it look weird, he has to give up his groomsmen.\n\nI was diagnosed with a form of high-functioning autism as a child, so I\u2019ve never been the best at picking up on social cues and whenever I\u2019ve started to make friends, they never stick around. I also lived by myself in college and never joined sororities/clubs, I don\u2019t have contact with anyone I knew from high school, I\u2019m not close with my colleagues (who are much older than me), and my free time is spent volunteering at the dog shelter, going to the gym, or working on my online masters. He knows my lack of friends is something I\u2019m self conscious/sad about, so I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s trying to make it such a big deal about it for our wedding. \n\nI spoke with my sister who agrees with me and  gets where I\u2019m coming from, and I know his sister would understand too. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m stopping him from having groomsmen if he wants, but he keeps saying that I am, and I either need to hire professional bridesmaids (which I can\u2019t afford) or get over myself and finally go make friends.

You\u2019re overthinking that one a bit.  My husband and his brother were each other\u2019s best man, and I don\u2019t think either had more groomsmen (obviously I know my husband didn\u2019t, but my BIL married before my husband and I met).\n\nIt does look odd when one side of the wedding party is much larger than the other.  Slightly uneven is pretty normal, though.  My wedding party was uneven (1 best man, 2 bridesmaids, and a ring bearer), so we just had them all come in from the sides instead of walking down the center aisle - that way, nobody was paired off, so nobody was singled out.  Can you compromise, with you having your sister and SIL and him choosing his 2-4 closest friends?\n\nNAH, but coming up with compromises that work for everyone is an important relationship skill.", "I think if this is the battle you pick at this stage, you need to re-examine your future.\n\nWhile seemingly important, the argument has no value in real life and yet you two don\u2019t seem to be able to negotiate.\n\nWhat will happen when you\u2019ll have more serious decisions to make? Children?  Big purchases? Changing careers?  \n\n\ni tend to say NTA but be mindful of what this situations implies for your future together.\n\nGood luck", "NTA\n\nYou'd already discussed this. You don't want any bridesmaids.  That should be end of story. \n\nIt also wouldn't be sad if it was just your sister and SIL as your attendants.  That's actually quite common.\n\nWhy does he want 9.  And yes his sister can be on his side.\n\nHe's trying to railroad you into doing what he and possibly his family want.  You might need to have a closer look at your relationship and whether you are happy with what's happening.\n\nAt my wedding we each had one attendant.  I had my stepsister, my husband had his mate.  They were also our witnesses.  It didn't look weird.  I didn't need a lot of attendants.", "ESH,\n\nUnless if Im reading it wrong you are both sitting the extreme points of the pole and not wanting to meet at the middle less even discussing it.\n\nHim - It has to be 9\n\nOP - It has to be 0 \n\nBe adults and talk about a compromise of sorts but I dont understand the saving cost by not having bridesmaid/groomsman (maybe because we are used to different customs)\n\nIs there something additional you would have to pay for on top of vs them just being there as a guest?\n\nBecause you would pay for the 'seat' regardless of the capacity they are there for, so is it like you have to pay for thier matching suit/dress or something? Maybe the compromise would be if they are willing to pay for whatever this extra cost is?", "INFO: Was your desire to have no bridesmaids or MOH something you\u2019d communicated before?", "ESH. It doesn't seem like either of you are compromising at all. There are a lot of numbers in between 0 and 9.\n\nIt isn't weird at all to have family in the wedding party. And if you are worried about the optics, then its gonna look way weirder if he has 9 and you have none. \n\nAsk both sisters and maybe try to find one more, if not then cap his at 3-4 and it won't look too odd. \n\nI'd also take a look at your future and what you want it to look like. If you are ok with a small number or no friends, are you going to be ok with him keeping up what seems to be a very active social life?", "NTA. It is unreasonable for your husband to force you to have bridesmaids (which I would say is your choice alone), and for you to either make friends for this purpose or to rent strangers to be them. It is also ridiculous to have 9 groomsmen. I would say the usual number is 3, inclusive of the best man. He knows you don't have friends that would be your bridesmaids, so he should have had an expectation of few or no bridesmaids. He knew this going into planning for the wedding.  It was an AH selfish move to invite his sister to be your bridesmaid without discussing with you first, and he likely did it to add numbers to your side so he could have his army of groomsmen.  I think a compromise could be your sis as MOH and his sis as a bridesmaid (if you want that), and him with a best man and one or two additional groomsmen. But also fine not to have any.", "This is another one of those wedding AITAs that make me question whether people ever solved literally any disagreement before deciding to get married.", "NAH. You just have two completely different ideas of what \"wedding\" means. You should be able to find a compromise; if not, it doesn't bode well for the marriage.\n\nEDit to add: My wife had 3 attendants, I had 2. MOH and best man walked together, then the groomsman walked with a bridesmaid on each arm. Everyone laughed and it was no big deal.", "NTA but basically he is right. He can\u2019t have groomsmen because it will highlight the fact that you have no friends if you choose not to have any bridesmaids at all.\n\nSo meet him in the middle ans have his sister and your sister, and then he can at least have a couple groomsmen", "NAH but there is a gap in your expectations versus his expectations that you need to address.\n\nYou said you are self conscious about not having many friends (and that your autism means you aren't great with social stuff), but also that you don't want any bridesmaids. I would like to focus on that.\n\n1 he clearly wants groomsmen, and it's important to him, so it's worth thinking about how you can compromise to make you both happy. Nine groomsmen is... a lot. Maybe there's a smaller number you could agree on?\n\n2 you can have bridesmaids and groomsmen without it being too expensive. Traditionally they would pay for their clothes, and if you're flexible about their options they can pick something they like and will wear again. Look online for alternatives to expensive bouquets (a friend of mine had hers carry a fan that matched the bride's dress, really pretty!) \n\n3 most people have just family for their wedding party, and 1-3 bridesmaids would be more typical than nine (that is a LOT! like a LOT!) so if you just had sisters as your bridesmaids that would be completely normal and nobody would think that it was strange, or that you didn't have friends. (And if they do they are an AH and not your friends!)\n\n4 if you wanted to build a closer friendship with someone, asking them to be your bridesmaids would be a great way to do it. If you asked his sister and your sister, that's telling them you value them and want them to be there with you at a really important moment.\n\n5 there's no rule that says you can't have groomsmaids and bridesmen, or that you must have the same number of attendants. The only people who matter here are you and your fiance. If you figure out an option that makes you both happy, don't worry what anyone else thinks!", "I am gonna say NAH he doesn\u2019t need 9 groomsmen but it\u2019s unfair for him to not have any of that\u2019s what he wants. A more suitable compromise would be that he has 2 or 3 and then you have 2 or 3 bridesmaids", "Totally get where you guys are both coming from. It\u2019s really about compromise though. The bridesmaids may not be important to you but they are to him. However you can do a 3 -1 style procession. 3 groomsmen 1 bridesmaid 3 groomsmen 1 bridesmaid 3 groomsmen\u2019s. The two sisters on your side will match your personality as more of an intimate person and his 9 groomsmen on his side reflecting his obvious out going nature which seems to represent you two beautifully. Weddings are the unique imperfections that make you two perfect but for either to full compromise whether you having a larger party or him having no party would like cause either one to be uncomfortable. Just a thought.", "Why are you even planning a wedding when you two have this kind of issue? Not only are you not on the same page, you\u2019re not even in the same book! He wants you to \u201cget over yourself and just make friends\u201d? Sounds like you are signing up to be dictated to and controlled by this man. Hard stop! You 2 need a therapist and lots of communication.", "No vote from me, but I am just so confused by all of this. Have either of you ever been to a wedding? Have either of you ever watched a movie or a TV show where there was a wedding? Because it sounds like you two don't know how they typically work.\n\nHere are some starting guidelines: Nine groomsmen is insane. Bridesmaids can be any age. and don't have to be related to you.", "Why not compromise, you have your sister and his sister as bridesmaids and he can only have two groomsmen instead of 9. That way, both of you are trading off. Two on each side is more than enough.", "I hope there\u2019s compromise here. It\u2019s not really a big deal if you make your SIL and sister your stand in bridesmaid. Your husband probably wants his groomsmen. Choose your battle.", "Have the partners of the groomsmen be the bridesmaids", "YTA. It's not just your wedding. You're not \"letting\" him? You're a controlling asshole.", "[removed]", "He knows you're self-conscience and sad about your lack of friends, but told you to get over it and go make some friends?  \n  \nThis concerns me because it is so cold.   \nIt is not something that a person who loves you would say.  \n  \nNot to mention how immature it is.  \n  \nI would just have the two sisters and two groomsmen and call it a day.  \n  \nY-T-A if you say no to all groomsmen.  \n  \nYour  wedding is a day for both of you, so he gets a say in the plans, too.  \n  \nEDIT:  Change of vote.

He can reduce his number of groomsmen so you don't have to find so many bridesmaids.\n\nEditing my judgement to EHS, having had some time to reflect.", "Naw nta", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't \"not letting him\" so much as \"he's not comfortable without you having Bridesmaids\", which is far from the same thing.  While I can understand both sides, the fact is he's being unreasonable since you're not actually limiting his option and he is demanding something from you.", "YTA You're being incredibly selfish and controlling. Your fianc\u00e9 wants groomsmen, and you're shutting him down because you don't want bridesmaids? Seriously? It's his wedding too, and he should be able to have groomsmen if that's what he wants. Your excuses about not having friends are just that, excuses. Stop making this all about you and start considering your partner's feelings for once.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nYour lack of friends is on you. You say you're selfconscious of it, but you don't do anything to address it. \n\nI don't think the lack of bridesmaids is a saving money thing, I think it's an excuse to hide your lack of friends. \n\n9 groomsmen is a lot.

WTF?", "NTA.  He has a right to want lots of groomsmen because it\u2019s his wedding, too, but his response to your wishes and concerns was insensitive and disrespectful.", "I can relate to this, I have aspergers (high functioning)as well. I feel like the argument you guys have is logical vs emotional sides, which I believe we both sometimes struggle a bit with. My fiancee and I have had a similar thing planning our wedding. We sat down and both explained what we wanted where we could budge and such and found a middle ground to it. I think it was regarding the bachelor party. She wanted her male family to join and I said it's just for the groomsmen and myself. Wasn't an argument but more of a debate. So middle ground groomsmen and I will have our thing, and the male members of her family and my groomsmen will have a lunch thing.

Red flag for me.", "Who the hell needs 9 groomsmen? \n\nAnd who asks someone to be someone else's  bridesmaid. \n\nYou get to decide who you want or don't want to be your bridesmaid.

Bridesmaids don't need to be expensive - you could just figure out some vaguely coordinated outfits from what they already own / are happy to buy themselves, which with just two people shouldn't be too hard, maybe with some unifying feature like flowers / some accessory to make it a little bit themed.

They may make me feel dead inside but at least there someone and I don't know if i can handle it without someone. Let me tell you, you can. You don't deserve to feel like this, to be treated like this.

Knowing he hurt me devastates him.

I really didn't want to have a bridal party for a variety of reasons. I find the idea sort of clique-ish, like, hey everyone, these are the people I like better than you! I also got married at a summer camp and was just going to hang out doing activities with the guests in general during the hours before the ceremony, not do a big \"getting ready\" process where I'd want specific people with me. But it was really important to my husband to have his brother and some close friends standing next to him, and if there's one thing I dreaded more than looking like I was playing favorites, it was the image of him surrounded by his people while I stood by myself. So I had a few bridesmaids. They all agreed enthusiastically when I asked them and, when the day came, I was actually glad to have \"my people\" during that last bit of the day where everyone was getting cleaned up after the hiking and swimming and baseball.\n\nI'm not saying you have to do that. If you would rather be by yourself on your side while your husband has 9 groomsmen, you can do that! The people who love you won't love you less. But I don't think it's reasonable to ask your fiance to have no one when he wants people with him. That experience does have value and if he wants it, please don't expect him to miss out. It IS reasonable, however, to ask him to have fewer than 9. Maybe some of those people can be ushers instead, or have a different important job like doing a reading?
