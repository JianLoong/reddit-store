We have 3 kids together (8, 7, & 5).  We have split custody, but the kids primarily live with their mom during the school year.  My ex is currently on a week-long vacation in Mexico with a group of friends, so the kids are staying with me.  I live outside of the bus route for their school so I have to drive them there in the morning and pick them up.  This requires me to get them up a bit earlier than they usually do at their mom's house, so I try to get them to sleep a bit earlier too.  \n\nLast night I had all the kids in bed by 8:30pm.  They weren't asleep yet, but they were in bed.  My ex sent a text at 8:45pm saying that they just finished dinner and she wanted to do a quick video chat with the kids to say goodnight.  I replied that the kids were already in bed and I didn't want to disturb them or get them riled up because we have to get up earlier in the morning to get to school on time.  \n\nShe said that it would be a quick call and she just wants to say hi and that she loves them quick.  I told her no.  She asked if they were asleep and I told her not yet, but I don't want to turn lights on or do anything that might delay them getting to sleep.  I told her that if she wants to talk to them the next day, that she should do it earlier in the night, possibly before she goes to dinner with her friends.  \n\nShe kept replying that it would be a quick chat and she just wants to tell them she loves them.  I told her no again and said I would let the kids know in the morning that she was thinking of them and that we can do a video chat the next night.  \n\nShe told me I was being a jerk and that a quick 2-3 minute call with the kids wouldn't hurt anything.  She just wanted to tell them she loves them before they go to sleep.  I told her she should have thought about that earlier in the day and not right at bedtime.  She said she doesn't get them ready for bed until 9pm at home so she knows they're awake.  I reminded her that I need to drive them to school which requires waking up earlier so if she wants to talk to them the next day, it's going to need to be earlier in the night, not right at bedtime.  \n\nShe tried one last time to say it would be a quick chat and I shut it down again.  I told her that just because she's on vacation time doesn't mean I am going to adjust my schedule to hers.  I told her that if she wants to talk to the kids while she's gone then it's going to be on my terms, not hers.   \n\nShe told me I'm being too rigid and that a quick chat with the kids wouldn't be as big of a deal as I'm making it out to be.  I told her maybe not, but I'm not changing my mind and we can try again the next night.  She agreed, but told me again that I'm being a jerk about this and I didn't need to make it so difficult.

I was going to go another direction, but once I saw the ages I totally agree with you, especially the 5 year old.  When my kids were that age if they were in bed and I did something to get them out of bed, it would essentially be starting the whole process over.", "NAH - she was fine in asking, you were fine to say no.\n\nHowever, I do want to point out that rigid inflexibility almost never works out, as there will likely be a time in the future wherein YOU are hoping for an exception to a rule, and she will have little incentive to adjust to your needs. In fact, she is likely to buckle down and refuse, simply because you did the same. \n\nSo I would suggest you hold to your boundaries when it\u2019s really necessary, but attempt to work with her for future calls.", "NTA, i feel like the a respectful conversation should have been over when you said the kids were in bed and you could try tomorrow. Her persistence on disrupting their routine alludes to me that she is used to dictating the terms and/or she had been drinking at dinner.", "I was going to say yes based off the title alone, but I\u2019m glad I read the whole thing. NTA in this situation and disturbing them would have delayed them going to sleep. She has every right to ask but should have left it alone when you said they were in bed.", "NTA. \nAll the YTAs don\u2019t have kids or don\u2019t deal with bedtimes, I\u2019m sure. The fact they were not asleep doesn\u2019t mean much, because they were already in their room and winding down for the night, and a 30-second \u201chello, goodnight\u201d can easily turn into having to spend another 30 mins of winding them down afterwards. \nOP handled it appropriately- a reasonable mom would have said- ok, I\u2019ll call back tomorrow at a more suitable time. I\u2019ve been on business trips where I couldn\u2019t free up until past bedtime, and I wouldn\u2019t dream of asking my husband to interrupt the bedtime routine. That said, I read between the lines that OP and ex\u2019s relationship is not the most amicable, so perhaps, in the future, better communication between OP and ex on timing and expectation will go a long way.", "NTA and all the people saying Y T A clearly are not parents or not very good ones. It would absolutely rile them up for a while even if it\u2019s a 30 second call, and she should know better than to ask. She\u2019s the asshole for trying to make you the bad guy.", " yeah, her five minute call means 30 minutes extra for you trying to get them to go to sleep and then cranky kids in the morning you have to deal with.\n\nTell her to send a video and you show to the kids in the morning and then she can call later that evening the next day", "NTA, once you\u2019ve gotten the kids into bed it\u2019s hell to disturb them. The only exception would be if this is something the kids EXPECT, because their mom calls them every night when they\u2019re at your house. If it\u2019s a part of the normal routine and the kids might be worried or unsettled by the deviation then it might be worth it\n\nOtherwise, the best compromise imo would be to have her send a video or voice memo for them to see in the morning and they can record a video to send back during the drive to school if their mom isn\u2019t awake yet for a call", "NTA \n\nBut I would get in front of it and let the kids know that their mom tried to call them after lights out and that she loves them but you asked her to call the next day cause you wanted  them to get sleep.\n\nDon't be negative but make them aware that yes she did call and you did tell her to call the next day.", "NTA, when my kids were that age, I would have refused a video call as well. And I did a couple times with their grandparents that live across the country and forget the time difference. Especially on a school night.", "I think NTA for this circumstance as long as you do the video call if she plans in advance. Your house your rules for bedtime, but you shouldn't withhold calls to punish your ex at the expense of your kids either.", "NTA", "NTA my kids were insufferable at bed time!! No way in hell I would have restarted the going to bed process after it was completed.", "NTA\n\nKids can take a minute to get to sleep and telling them to get up to talk to mom isn't going to make them go to sleep easier. \n\nI don't think she is an AH for asking once but repeatedly makes her a bit of one.  Now that she knows the schedule, she can try again tomorrow.", "NTA. I\u2019m a mom of a 5yo and when it\u2019s bedtime and all is quiet, disturbing the kid is out of the question! You\u2019d be up another hour trying to get the kid to get into that calm place again. \n\nMaybe tell the mom you have a tight schedule and you want her to be able to chat with her kids so X, Y, and Z are good times just give you a heads up.", "She could have just as easily not made it difficult either. NTAH", "NTA, I'm a mom that travels for work a lot. I call before dinner for this exact reason. Kids those ages would absolutely get wound up by a quick call.", "NTA - They were at your house, you were in charge. She was fine to ask as she didnt know they were im bed but after that there was no need for her to push this.", "NAH\n\nYou had a valid reason to get them to bed early. She also is far away from her kids and I'm sure she just wanted to see their faces and hear their voices.\n\nCan you set it up for a few minutes earlier the rest of her trip?", "NTA\n\nyou said no and gave a valid reason, she should have dropped it and agreed to call earlier the next night.", "NTA because the kids were already in bed, whether they were asleep or not. If you were just starting the bedtime routine I would think differently but it sounds like the routine was already done so at that point it\u2019s too late unless she thought it was appropriate to force you to do the whole thing over again. I don\u2019t think her making the initial request was an asshole move but the persistence and not thinking about the kids\u2019 needs over her own wants moves her into asshole territory.", "Bring the down votes. ANY parent that cannot or will not understand the process of getting YOUNG children to bed, realistically are not considering their children. I had a routine with my boys, in bed by 7:30pm and sleep by 8pm. Their bus was picking them up at 6:15 am and this was elementary school because the elementary children had to ride the bus with middle school children. \n\nThe ONLY way my children's routine would be disturbed is Jesus coming and telling me to wake them up. It is not about the parent, it is about the children being prepared for the next day. Mom is not clueless she knows that dad has to wake them earlier to get them to school on time. \n\nPARENTS PLEASE STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING N THE CHILD'S BEST INTEREST.", "We know how kids are. And you've got 3. They're going to want to know about her trip, they're going to all want to tell them about themselves and whatever they've done that day. That quick 2-3 minute chat would turn into half an hour and when telling the kids \"ok ok time for bed, gotta go\" they'll be all mad they didn't get to tell mommy something. They won't want to get up in the morning because of lack of sleep. \n\nNope. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is why I call earlier bc they can still start their down time followed by bed on schedule by me doing that. There\u2019s a balance whether together or not and she should definitely understand and plan accordingly. \nHowever OP, if this was a one time thing you could\u2019ve just let her say \u201cgood night I love you\u201d to each kid and that\u2019s it.

As others have said, this absolutely will be a longer call than 5 minutes, plus looking at phone screens right before bed (blue light) can disrupt sleep. That and the excitement of mom is gonna get them wired. \n\nThis will probably lead to them staying up past 9 and being harder to put back down again and then causes issues with getting them up in the morning and making sure they get to school on time. 8:30 vs 9 considering the circumstances makes sense (it's not like you put them to bed at 7) and it is your house, your rules.\n\nYou also offered a good compromise, you'll tell the kids she called in the morning and tried to plan a time the next evening - I think that was reasonable.", "Nah..BUT being inflexible is going to come back and bite you in the a$$ one day.

You weren\u2019t being spiteful.", "YTA. Yes, I have kids, and yes, they have bedtimes, but I've been a traveling mom. It was the first time, and she didn't know you had changed the bedtime. If she kept doing it after knowing or if they were already asleep, she would be TAH. Sounds like a power play to me. You knew they were still awake  Hopefully, you never need an exception made.", "NTA. Surely the ex could have made a video that the kids could view the next day.   \nYou're trying to keep them on a regular schedule, and it wasn't like it was some emergency (eg. the mother was in the hospital). \n\nIf I was the OP, I would have just said they're in bed, asleep, and leave it at that. It would be disruptive if he brought in the phone and had them talk to their mother (and they could have been on the verge or even had fallen asleep by then). Then he would have had to read them another story to get them back asleep. \n\nI imagine if the shoe was on the other foot, the mother wouldn't have let the father have a post-bedtime call with them, just because he got the urge to talk with them.", "No, your reasoning is perfectly sound.", "NTA. As a parent she should have known better than to call right around bedtime,  obviously that's going to get them riled up. Your suggestions were completely reasonable.", "Nta. And when the kids go back make sure to do it back saying 2 minutes isn't a big deal", "NTA. Plain and simple and anyone saying differently hasn\u2019t had to put children to bed. Ex-wife being totally unreasonable. Once she heard \u201cno, maybe tomorrow\u201d she should have said \u201cok,\u201d but I suspect she was at least a little tipsy and just wanted to fight.

Regardless, the kids are his responsibility this week so she can have fun.

At the same time, I don\u2019t see how allowing the kids to say good night to their mother for 30 seconds would have affected their ability to sleep. Rather than focusing on who is right and who is wrong, it\u2019s better to set up a time for her to talk to the kids every night for the rest of her trip. She called 15 minutes before their regular bedtime so now that she you put them to bed at 8:30 instead of 9pm, it should be easy to come up with a time that works for you both.", "NTA.

IF you love your kids, find a way to get along with your ex. The greatest gift you can give your kids is to have a working relationship with their other parent. \n\nYou were within your rights to refuse her but there will be a time when she is within hers to refuse a request you have.

Sometimes a little flexibility goes a long way.", "YTA. there was a very easy solution here: Phone call not video chat. No need to turn the lights on, just hand the phone to the kid in bed, give them 30 secs to say I love you, then go to the next. Are you truly so petty?", "NTA - BUT I do think you are going to want to apologizes to your ex-wife about being so rigid because this is going to bite you on the butt later when she holds this against you and you want to maybe pick up the kids early to go to a dinner with your family, or if you want to speak to them on a day that it out of the ordinary. \n\nI 100% get were you're coming from not wanting to break the routine you're trying to set, with 3 kids it isn't easy to set a new routine and get them up at a different time for just 1 week.  Apologize today,  say you'd like to schedule some time that works with her vacation time, and the house schedule so she can see the kids on video chat.", "YTA - Seems like you were being petty by not allowing her to say a quick ILY and goodnight. How would that rile the children up? \n\nI don't know, the best outcomes are always when the parents put their children first, regardless of their feelings.

There's no reason she has to say goodnight after they've gone to bed, especially when she's not the one dealing with the consequences. She should've called beforehand.", "I don't think being inflexible about this should bite OP in the ass unless OP's ex is is a petty asshole.  Depending on the kids, getting them to go to sleep can be a process, and interrupting that will leave them tired at school tomorrow.\n\nI would never call someone with young kids after 8pm unless it was an emergency.  OP's ex didn't plan well.  Parents have every right to be inflexible when it is in their child's best interest.  Proper sleep is critical for health and focus, and often good behavior as well.\n\nIt isn't going to harm the kids to not hear \"goodnight and I love you\" from mom one night", "You clearly don\u2019t have young kids, even a quick call would keep the 5 year old up way past 9pm. Plus I know everyone is different but that\u2019s already very late for a small one. My 4 year old goes to bed at 7pm!", "These kids' sleep schedule is a little confusing. All the kids seem to have the same bed time, which is odd given their ages. Mom says she usually gets the kids ready for bed at 9 which seems really late for a 5 year old unless they can sleep in quite a bit in the morning.\n\nAnd it does seem a little optimistic to try to change the bed time of kids who are only staying with you for a week.", "Yep. This is eventually going to come back and bite OP in the ass when they want flexibility. And then they will be all up in arms about how mom is horrible and totally rigid and it isn\u2019t a big deal!", "??? He literally did\n\n>  I told her no again and said I would let the kids know in the morning that she was thinking of them and that we can do a video chat the next night\n\nOP isn't being rigid. He is being a responsible parent. It's pretty clear that kids need to sleep, the conversation would go longer than 2-3 minutes because the kids would be asking how the trip was, Mom may ask about their day, etc, etc. quick call **right** before bed is never quick. \n\n Maybe N A H to start, although the Mom should've been paying more attention to time if it was important to call them, and still you don't call like that so close to bedtime because it completely throws off the schedule.\n\nThis is a NTA", "Yeah, OP really does need to pick his battles better.", "Yeah, the fact she kept asking, my thought was a few drinks at dinner making her \"needing\" to talk to her kids", "Yeah, she sounds exhausting.  Good mom and all that, but likes getting her way.", "Right?  The five year old suddenly remembers Mom is far away and tears and a terrible night of sleep for everyone is a likely probability.", "Hell I'm a grown adult and an interruption to my winding down time can set me back 30 mins or more on getting to sleep. The lost sleep isn't as big a deal to me, but it would be for kids.", "To me, it sounds like the mother had some free time after dining and impulsively decided to call to speak to the kids. Once the OP said they were in bed, she should have left it at that and tell him she'll make a video and email to him to show the kids the next day.  \nIt was a week's vacation, and surely this wasn't an emergency but spur of the moment call.", "You\u2019re wrong.", "I disagree with the \u2018not very good ones\u2019 comment.  I am a parent. I co-parented with my ex.  If my ex called while our son was in bed but still awake, of course I would have taken the phone to my son and said \u2018your dad wants to say good night to you\u2019.   Our child feeling loved and thought of is more important than the few minutes it would take to settle him again.", "If it had been roles reversed they wouldn\u2019t have said YTA. But because the mom with more custody means they think she deserves what she wants", "I\u2019m a parent with two ND kiddos and I regularly get compliments on my parenting. I think he\u2019s TA. Rigid, presumptive, judgemental people are rarely as good of parents as they imagine themselves to be though.", "No I\u2019m not a parent I\u2019m a preschool teacher who has to get 18 of them boogers down in 20 mins or risk my boss getting mad because teacher lunches got ruined.  Op can handle letting three kids say good night.", "That\u2019s a good idea! I was thinking since he has to drive them to school she could\u2019ve scheduled a call for during that time or just wait until the next afternoon after school. The fact she pushed the issue bothers me a lot", "It sounded like the ex had no regard for the kid\u2019s sleep, because it\u2019s never just 30 seconds.", "So disrupt their sleep routine instead? How is that not at the expense of the kids. Bedtime is not a time for phone calls.", "She could have call earlier in day at any point and talked to them ex hubby NTA!  Ex wife is needy ass for keeping on. If I called my daughter was asleep I would said no don\u2019t bother her and she\u2019s 12 not 5!", "Yep. A child's need ALWAYS comes before the wants of an adult.", "But she did phone before their normal bedtime. She didn\u2019t know he changed their routine. That what makes him the AH, he could have said that he would allow it that one time because she didn\u2019t know, but next time phone earlier", "I'm married, my husband works nights. Sometimes he doesn't answer my bedtime calls because he's busy or in a dead zone. I give my kids a bit of extra time in case he calls back, but there are times where I put them to bed before he's called back.\n\nThere's been times he calls back right after I've put them in bed. I answer the phone but I don't disturb the kids. He's disappointed every time but he understands what a nightmare it is to restart the bedtime routine, so he accepts the no the first time he hears it.", "Taking everything OP is saying at face value, I would have told my husband the kids were asleep and since he is not an AH he would not have ever pushed me over and over to wake them up on a school night. \n\nIf someone is in the military and you only get to talk to them once a month, then that\u2019s a different story but the mom was in Mexico on vacation. She should not have pushed the issue. It was selfish. Protect those kids\u2019 sleep so they don\u2019t end up with lifelong sleep issues (like me)", "Same & agreed. He sounds bitter as fuck.", "Because being petty will help the situation?", "It resets the wind down period back to the start. So if they\u2019ve been in bed 15 minutes already, and it takes them 30 to get to sleep, it\u2019s going to take at least 30 more minutes, if not more for them to be able to sleep. I totally get this. It\u2019s not about right or wrong.  It\u2019s about setting the kids up for a successful morning.", "You think it will be just 30 seconds? Wow you don\u2019t have a clue. I have a 2,4,5 and my wife gets home at 8:30. It\u2019s a nightmare . Calls can end up with crying kids and over 30 mins to settle them back . All for an \u201cI love you\u201d. Screw that . Anyone with common sense knows it\u2019s not just 30 seconds.", "She wanted to do a video call. There have been studies on blue light and sleep. It would definitely have affected their ability to sleep.", "But why would he live there when they are divorced?", "Because a quick \"night, love you\" could easily turn into the kids being hyped up and asking a million questions, not wanting to settle back down, and then not wanting to get up on time in the morning. \n\nI agree it would have been a nice gesture, but it also could have been a very disruptive one.", "What if one of them started to cry because they miss mommy?

The mom should have asked him what was convenient for him.", "Were the kids expecting a call from mom?", "He didn\u2019t mention it but I can tell you that when I traveled and my kids were that young, one of them always cried when I called. It reminded my child I went away, which led to me not being there with her, and then she\u2019d cry. I would never ask my husband to disrupt bedtime for that.

My son was in school and oftentimes my work schedule and his didn't align due to time zone changes. There were some nights I got to him too late and I never asked my husband to wake him. He offered and my response was, no, he had school the next day, I didn't' want to bother him. It was my fault for calling too late. My son had trouble falling asleep and was easily excitable, and I didn't want to make it even harder. I knew my \"2 minute call\" would go longer because neither of us can shut up, then he'd be energized and want to talk more to dad, and be very grumpy the next morning. \n\nI agree with NAH because she didn't think their schedule had changed but upon hearing they were in bed, she should have dropped it. OP is right in that aspect but to be so rigid that it's \"his way or the highway\" will most definitely come back to bite him in the ass. And the sad thing is it's the kids who suffer most when ex's can't coparent amicably.", "Yea this is fair. I don't see being rigid.

The kids were already tucked in and its going to be a long process to settle them again after a 2 min call. It's quite hard to get 3 little kids to bed and ready for school on time all on your own. I don't blame OP at all for saying no.\n\nMom was being a giant jerk insisting on this call. Everyone makes mistakes and this could be chalked up to her being tipsy after a girls vacay dinner.\n\nIf she does try to retaliate over this situation, she's just a shitty person who would always have been inflexible.", "I agree. The whole repetitive discussion screamed under the influence of alcohol to me.", "She doesnt care about the hour because it's not her who's going to end up with cranky kids or having to stay up for longer to get them to sleep.", "Seconding this, kids need as much sleep as possible. Everyone (except the mom apparently) knows that even if the call was as quick as she was promising, it would still set the kids back majorly, and then they\u2019d be cranky getting up and to school in the morning, and who has to deal with that? Certainly not the mom, the person who caused it.", "She called before their normal bedtime.", "This!! I raised them by myself and when they would go visit their dad, I called them every night to say goodnight.

It doesnt sound like it was for the kids as much as getting back at her.", "I think it depends on how often they get to talk to the other parent.

My daughter worked at a preschool, then we had a custody of a 7yr old cousin. \n\nShe thought she was ready and it wasn't much different too. 1) every kids different, she was a bear herself to get to sleep - her brother easy. 2) kids taking a nap know it's just a nap and they get to play, etc when they get up - bedtime is a long time and usually is not fun when you wake up hurrying for school.3) mom leaving for the day as scheduled for work is not a disruption - mom leaving on vacation and calling at bedtime is different and going to wake them fully up and start the whole process over everytime.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Depends on the kids. They are not all the same.", "Of course OP could have handled getting them back to bed - he never said otherwise.  He was making sure they got enough sleep for an early morning (one they are not used to) and being a responsible parent.  She was not thinking of her kids needs and refused to let it go.

The kids live with her primarily for ten months out of the year, so I\u2019m sure she has just as much insight into their sleep cycle as OP does, if not more so.

Hell, maybe during the afternoon", "Growing up, this was my life. My dad was a corporate executive and had to travel every three months for work.

Or did she pick this random night and insist on it? Communication is always the answer. Giving the other parent a heads up (especially single parenting 3 kids at bedtime) should have been her first step.", "Some kids maybe, but most kids no. Disturbing sleep routines is a nightmare.", "So the 5 year old doesn\u2019t get to talk to mom but the older two do?  Yeah, that\u2019ll end well \ud83d\ude02", "Everyone's kids are different. My kids do not settle easily... our personal experiences have no bearing here. OP says his kids won't settle easily so we should take him at his word. \n\nI assume that you guys coordinate the call so that the kids and the spouse at home aren't left hanging. To do otherwise is super inconsiderate and putting an unnecessary burden on the person who is shouldering the childcare. \n\nIf you are too busy having fun on your vacay to coordinate, it's your fuck up and you shouldn't insist on having your way. Everyone fucks up now and then - I'm not saying the mom is a monster. But in this situation she is completely in the wrong. \n\nI'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt and say she will recognize this on her own and will do better about setting up an appropriate time to call which works for everyone. If she doesn't, well I see why they divorced.", ">Claims they have 50/50 custody but the kids live with his wife? Come on think critically here. This is a smokescreen.\n\nAh there it is, you don't like the OP/don't trust what he has to say. You really shouldn't be here commenting if you can't give advice without bias imo.", "So you got paid to put those children down again whereas OP is just the dad who\u2019s gonna have to deal with grumpy kids in the morning before going off to his own job. The scenarios aren\u2019t even close to the same", "I was thinking about the kids and it\u2019s just a week, but ok", "I have two children. \n\nQuick in and out. Mom says hi, love you, goodnight. Then \"Mommy has to go to bed now, goodnight guys\" the adults are entirely in control of the situation and the time limit. \n\nEveryone's blowing this so far out of proportion. If your children are mentally incapable of handling this type of an interaction it's a failure of parenting.", "I don\u2019t understand why people aren\u2019t getting this. I would never ask my husband to disrupt the kids bedtime to satisfy my need to say good night.", "Exactly, makes no sense and all these NTA's prove why their are assholes in this world and why they keep getting away with everything. Look at how many people not only excuse this bullshit but they are legit trying to make the mother out to be the bad guy.", "No, I'm not saying he's being too rigid on this. I said he was right in not bending for this. But he has to make sure he's not too rigid on other things that are not as important. She is not innocent in this, but I can't give her advice.", "Exactly. You can have 50/50 I\u2019m not actually having it worked out that way realistically. \n\nMy ex and I have 50/50 custody. Overall, my kids end up spending a bit more time with me because the pets are at my house \ud83d\ude02", "Those grumpy kids are his children, but they\u2019re hers too. It shouldn\u2019t be an inconvenience for him to be a father.", "Because this is how abusive people are protected. They do shitty thing \u201cbut they had a good reason\u201d and anyone use to hearing the bs are like \u201cyawn you\u2019re a joke\u201d. Sort of how my ex friend was able to rip me off for 6k and keep the friend group because \u201cyou\u2019re broken because of trauma I\u2019m right you\u2019re wrong. Oh and I helped you that one time so I\u2019m owed your money\u201d. And that fucking worked."]}
