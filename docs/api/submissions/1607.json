They removed the plate which it sounds like your husband was actively eating from, and they still expected you to pay for it? That in itself is not right.

So when the host didn't seem to think it would be a problem, I honestly didn't think twice about it until the food arrived. Totally accept that I was annoying, I just need to step up my vigilance.", "Naw they told the hostess. Not best practice but an honest mistake that a good restaurant would take pride in correcting.", "It happened so fast, and without discussion, manager literally walked over to the table and took the plate before asking what we wanted to do. He wasn't exactly rude, just rushed.", "Yeah I can definitely see how this happened. The hostess doesn\u2019t know the menu. Servers do menu tests to provide a better experience for situations like this. Most hostesses I\u2019ve worked with are great at telling you what you need to hear and want you to feel like your about to have a great experience. They might have had every intention to tel the server but muscle memory brought them right back to the door to greet the next guest. Just do yourself a favour by telling the server next time.", "INFO\n\nYou told the host? Or the server, directly??", "I\u2019ve been a server for a good bit, and the standard practice can go about 3 ways. If you remake or replace a dish, you either leave the charge, or you remove the original charge, and charge for the new item. If you just remove the item, you remove the charge. If you leave the charge you leave the item on the table, unless the guest specifically asks for the dish to be taken away. \n\nAfter fixing the original situation, you would follow up with either a dessert gift (much lower food cost than an entree item), or some after dinner drink for the table (amari, limoncello, etc). Solid gesture that costs the restaurant very little and makes the guest feel heard. \n\nWhat they did at this restaurant is atrocious. If you weren\u2019t able to eat the food, because they REMOVED it, then they absolutely cannot charge you for it. This was a very simple miscommunication issue that could have been resolved with acknowledgement of the fault, and while it doesn\u2019t seem as though you expected anything for free, a small gesture/gift would be standard practice where I work. \n\nOne thing that\u2019s weird to me though, is that it was important enough that you thought to bring it up to the hostess, but not to the server. It\u2019s just a very unusual way to convey a food aversion, and you will probably encounter surprise cilantro again, unless you ask the person who\u2019s job is to know the menu and to convey your needs to the kitchen.\n\nNTA", "ESH. They should have comped that meal, and you're always the AH if you go up to the kitchen to complain. Just wait for your server. BoH doesn't get paid extra in tips to put up with your nagging.", "honestly i would have stiffed them on the tip on top of not paying for that dish. you told them you didn't like cilantro. yet they served you a dish that had that. why would you pay for that dish?", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s standard in a decent restaurant to remove items from the bill that weren\u2019t right, especially if you returned the dish.", "Did OP do that though? She informed the \u201chost\u201d\u2026\n\nThe manager said OP should have informed more staff\u2026.does he mean OP did not inform the server?", "I told the host, who asked if we had any dietary requirements when we were seated. When I mentioned coriander, I specifically asked if there were any meals I should avoid, and the host assured me I would be fine, so I didn't even think to tell the waiter.", "Host promoted us for dietary requirements when we were seated and assured we'd be fine with the menu. I just assumed this was part of their process, and messages would be passed along (which it usually is in most restaurants where we are).", "Blame the server or management for making it so that OP had to do that. That's an internal issue, not OP's.", "They told the host, not the server. Still NTA because the restaurant didn\u2019t handle it properly, but not surprised the message didn\u2019t make its way back to the kitchen.", "Even that doesn't matter when the manager physically took away the plate of food. What's OP supposed to even be paying for at that point?", "OPs impatience isn't an internal issue.", "The host is also an employee of the restaurant."]}
