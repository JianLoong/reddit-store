They stuffed up, removed the dish, then still charged you for it. Nope.", "NTA at all. They removed the plate which it sounds like your husband was actively eating from, and they still expected you to pay for it? That in itself is not right. But the idea that you needed to inform more than one staff member (which is to say, the one conveying your order to the kitchen) about your requests for your order is absurd.

He wasn't exactly rude, just rushed.", "Yeah I can definitely see how this happened. The hostess doesn\u2019t know the menu. Servers do menu tests to provide a better experience for situations like this. Most hostesses I\u2019ve worked with are great at telling you what you need to hear and want you to feel like your about to have a great experience. They might have had every intention to tel the server but muscle memory brought them right back to the door to greet the next guest. Just do yourself a favour by telling the server next time."]}
