We still paid the remainder of the bill and left a hefty tip (staff were really lovely, just flustered and poor communication).\n\n\nEdit for further clarification:\n\n1. Host prompted us if we had any dietary requirements. I explained my dislike for coriander, and specifically asked if there were any menu items I should avoid. Host assured that we would be fine. As menu was quite bland, and I assumed info was passed onto the waiter (waiter didn't ask about dietary requirements), I didn't think to tell the waiter as well. With hindsight, I really wish I had.\n\n\n2. An old friend is a restaurant manager, and he told me how annoying it is when he gets told things after the meal is finished. I went up to the service area after a reasonable amount of time failing to get a waiter's attention, and had a discrete word with the manager (who I'd actually thought was another waiter, covering a break at the time).", "created_utc": 1667722504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynkfoj/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_dish_at_a/", "score": 137, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Totally accept that I was annoying, I just need to step up my vigilance.", "Naw they told the hostess. Not best practice but an honest mistake that a good restaurant would take pride in correcting.", "It happened so fast, and without discussion, manager literally walked over to the table and took the plate before asking what we wanted to do. He wasn't exactly rude, just rushed.", "Yeah I can definitely see how this happened. The hostess doesn\u2019t know the menu. Servers do menu tests to provide a better experience for situations like this. Most hostesses I\u2019ve worked with are great at telling you what you need to hear and want you to feel like your about to have a great experience. They might have had every intention to tel the server but muscle memory brought them right back to the door to greet the next guest. Just do yourself a favour by telling the server next time.", "INFO\n\nYou told the host? Or the server, directly??", "I\u2019ve been a server for a good bit, and the standard practice can go about 3 ways. If you remake or replace a dish, you either leave the charge, or you remove the original charge, and charge for the new item. If you just remove the item, you remove the charge. If you leave the charge you leave the item on the table, unless the guest specifically asks for the dish to be taken away. \n\nAfter fixing the original situation, you would follow up with either a dessert gift (much lower food cost than an entree item), or some after dinner drink for the table (amari, limoncello, etc). Solid gesture that costs the restaurant very little and makes the guest feel heard. \n\nWhat they did at this restaurant is atrocious. If you weren\u2019t able to eat the food, because they REMOVED it, then they absolutely cannot charge you for it. This was a very simple miscommunication issue that could have been resolved with acknowledgement of the fault, and while it doesn\u2019t seem as though you expected anything for free, a small gesture/gift would be standard practice where I work. \n\nOne thing that\u2019s weird to me though, is that it was important enough that you thought to bring it up to the hostess, but not to the server. It\u2019s just a very unusual way to convey a food aversion, and you will probably encounter surprise cilantro again, unless you ask the person who\u2019s job is to know the menu and to convey your needs to the kitchen.\n\nNTA", "ESH. They should have comped that meal, and you're always the AH if you go up to the kitchen to complain. Just wait for your server. BoH doesn't get paid extra in tips to put up with your nagging.", "honestly i would have stiffed them on the tip on top of not paying for that dish. you told them you didn't like cilantro. yet they served you a dish that had that. why would you pay for that dish?", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s standard in a decent restaurant to remove items from the bill that weren\u2019t right, especially if you returned the dish.", "Did OP do that though? She informed the \u201chost\u201d\u2026\n\nThe manager said OP should have informed more staff\u2026.does he mean OP did not inform the server?", "I told the host, who asked if we had any dietary requirements when we were seated. When I mentioned coriander, I specifically asked if there were any meals I should avoid, and the host assured me I would be fine, so I didn't even think to tell the waiter.", "Host promoted us for dietary requirements when we were seated and assured we'd be fine with the menu. I just assumed this was part of their process, and messages would be passed along (which it usually is in most restaurants where we are).", "Blame the server or management for making it so that OP had to do that. That's an internal issue, not OP's.", "They told the host, not the server. Still NTA because the restaurant didn\u2019t handle it properly, but not surprised the message didn\u2019t make its way back to the kitchen.", "Even that doesn't matter when the manager physically took away the plate of food.

It's not your job to inform every employee.\n\nThey made your food wrong, then tried to charge you for food you couldn't eat. So no, nta for refusing to pay for it.\n\nEdit to add, you shouldn't have tipped either. Tips are for good service. Host ignored your food preference, they took you plate without replacing it, made your food wrong, blamed you for their mistake, and demanded you pay for their mistake. There was no good service worth tipping.", "NTA but future reference any dietary restriction or dislikes you need to tell your server because that's the person who is taking care of you.

How much of the offending dish did he eat before you walked the plate up to the kitchen?", "YTA a little bit. \n\nTelling a host isn\u2019t how you avoid a food issue. Host seats people and takes reservations. The people who take your order are people who are tasked with advocating to the cooks. This is basic dining out stuff. \n\nDo you tell coat check to seat you? The valet to make you a drink?\n\nNo. \n\nYou messed up. But!!! That\u2019s ok. The waitron or manager should have just fixed it if requested and if returned you shouldn\u2019t have it on your bill.", "Considering they mentioned herbs such as thyme, rosemary and basil on other menu items, you would think coriander would have been obvious!", "I mean, if the host reassured it wouldn't be a problem regarding their dietary restrictions, then could you really fault OP?", "She actually told the hostess and not her server", "None. He was waiting on a response from the manager before starting.", "why have the HOST ask if they aren't going to do anything with the information.\n\nIf the HOST(ess) asked, I would conclude that this was their process and not that it was just some bizarre pleasantry that I had to keep reaffirming to multiple people(re the manager's comment).    \nIf I hate mushrooms and tell the host this and am assured that I won't have a problem with mushrooms, then do I have to tell the server? the cook? the bus boy? How many people am I required to inform to be assured no mushrooms in my meal?", "I'm not sure why you told the *host* and not your *server*.", "Respectfully I think ESH\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t have whisked it away. \n\nBut you absolutely did not cover your bases here. You need to tell the server once you realize the host isn\u2019t the one communicating with the kitchen.", "Oh... that changes it a bit then.

Or did you just deny a replacement and walk away?", "Calm down I commented before the edit", "Yeah, ESH", "The host asked, which implies they are the person to tell this to. I also would have assumed that meant the host would say something to the server, otherwise what\u2019s the point of asking at that stage?", "Third paragraph, second sentence; they couldn't get the attention of their waiter and that's when OP went to the service hatch.", "I totally get that she should\u2019ve told her waiter. But how can you reasonable expect someone to pay for something they didn\u2019t have? She wasn\u2019t refusing to eat it. It was just taken away.

But why wouldn't you tell the person who is going to be *directly communicating* with the people making your food?\n\nI have 17years experience as a professional chef, fine dining on down, and not once has it fallen to the hostess to manage dietary restrictions since they *don't ring tickets in to the kitchen*.", "I'm not sure why OP didn't t their server *while they were placing their order.*", "So she just walked off and didn\u2019t bother trying to get her food back? That\u2019s if I read the post.", "I've added to my original post. Where we live it's become normal for the host to ask about dietary requirements and pass on the info.", "It's, I'm sure, still common courtesy to tell the person who is directly ringing your food in to the kitchen of your dietary restrictions.", "Quit it with the stick up your arse. They've already clarified that normalcy for them is telling the host of their dietary restrictions and having said host pass on the info. Could they have also told their server? Sure, but why would they when they've already told someone who was supposed to inform other staff and therefore feel reassured? I'm pretty sure because of this situation, now OP knows to inform as many staff as possible."]}
