While standing in line at a ride, I was approached by a man who I didn't even recognize at first because I haven't seen him in three years, but when he started talking to me I realized he was Barry, whose best friend used to be a friend of mine so we went to a few parties together as teenagers. \n\nHe asked me whether I wanted to grab a quick beer with him and his friend, and I always liked him well enough back then, so I thought what's the harm and agreed. \n\nSo Barry, his friend, a female friend of mine (Nancy) and myself went to get a drink while our three other friends went to go on another ride. Barry told Nancy and me to look for seats while he and his buddy went to buy the drinks. When they came back, Nancy and me tried to give them the money for our drinks back, but they insisted on paying them for us. \n\nWe all drank our beer, smoked a cigarette and made kind of awkward conversation for about ten minutes. I could tell Nancy was feeling weird about this and I felt awkward as well. \n\nThen they asked us whether we wanted to go with them and basically spend the rest of the evening together. I wasn't feeling it at all though and neither was Nancy, so I told them \"thank you for the beer and it was nice meeting you guys, but our friends will be back soon and we will be spending the night with the friend group\". They didn't say anything but we could tell they were really annoyed and bummed out. They left and our friends came back a few minutes after.\n\nWhen I told my mom about this this morning she said I was very mean for sending them off like that, they could have come along with our friend group, they were probably sad and also they bought us drinks which was nice of them. I also feel kind of bad about it, since both of them seemed like nice people, but I just wanted to have one quick beer together, chat for a minute and go my way.

I know this is a cultural thing. But where I'm from buying drinks is not a thing. I mean not between buddies and also not between girls. You buy *your own* drinks. I'm not saying it does *never* happen but it's not as common as in the UK for example. Where I'm from we firmly believe in split bills. You invite someone only if you are really really good friends or are very close. Like idk siblings, parents, own adult kids, a colleague you've known forever and who saved your a$s the other day. \n\nIf a man buys a drink for a girl let alone a girl he didn't meet in years that's a clear sign and not a sign of \"hey we haven't talked in years lets just hang out\". I've been in quite a few places on this planet and to my observations this topic is quite a global thing too. \n\nI mean just like \"do you want some coffee\" is not about coffee, drinks bought by a man for a woman (he oftentimes barely knows) are not about drinks and just hanging out.   \n\nI don't even think that's bad. It's a code like the coffee thing. It's just that as a girl you should know this drink comes maybe with certain hopes or expectations and should think if you can put up with this *before* accepting the free drink. If the drink does not come with a hidden agenda then no harm is done if you quickly think this over upfront. I mean you still can accept the drinks.

They didn't buy your company for the evening by offering you a beer.", "NTA, but I\u2019d never take an offer for a drink because it comes with expectations I don\u2019t intend to meet. A free drink isn\u2019t worth risking hurting some misogynistic AH\u2019s overinflated ego and putting my safety at risk.

It was his choice to buy you the drink.", "NTA : You should remind your mom that someone buying you a drink does not make you obligated to do ANYTHING.", "Yeah, if the conversation hadn't been awkward the night may have gone a different way.

I mean you are close to being the asshole but since the conversation was getting awkward and wasn't really vibing with your friend and yourself, it's best to send them off", "NTA.\nYou don't owe these guys anything, even if you know each other. Its okay to just have a drink/chat and split to do your thing with the people you originally went with.", "How naive is your mum - \"When I told my mom about this this morning she said I was very mean for sending them off like that, they could have come along with our friend group, they were probably sad and also they bought us drinks which was nice of them.\"\n\nThey brought you drinks with the intention of getting you and your friend to spend the evening with them, probably the night also.", "NTA\nThe only ah in the situation is your mom berating you when obviously Barry wanted to have sex. He was just bummed that it was a swing and a miss. Him and his friend played the game but came up short on the rizz. Youre mom's true thoughts are probably something along the lines that you and Nancy should have let them get lucky because they bought y'all drinks. \n\nBut it's called getting lucky for a reason, it was a game of luck they played with their chances with you and Nancy. As for you accepting the drink at all you had no reason to make assumptions he easily could have just been an old friend looking to catch up, not your fault that wasn't the case. \n\nHe played he lost", "NTA, this whole idea of men buying a chick a drink and expecting ANYTHING in return really is the most creepy, slimy thing ever.

You tried to pay them back for their drinks. That put them on notice. Then you dismissed yourselves.

They don't get to expect more from you, and anyone who thinks they should have been allowed to stick around when you weren't comfortable with them is just wrong. Sorry, mum, but it doesn't work like that any more, thank heaven.", "I will agree with your mom yes you probably could have offered for them to join the group. That being said you are NTA he asked if you wanted to have drinks you did that and you even offered to pay so you fulfilled the get drinks obligation. I can say as a dude my initial reaction would be, I thought we were hitting it off now I'm a little hurt you dropped me a little rough but after a bit I wouldn't worry about it or I would have got your number to get back in touch with you.", "I mostly agree with your point except they didn't say anything to op and her friend so I don't think they were dicks. It sounds like they simply accepted the swing and a miss.

Those days are long gone.", "You can't even answer the question.  So good job, buds.", "you are basically saying it is more common to get a spiked drink in the present. but i think that is wrong and the rate is either the same or less than it was decades ago.", "You should take what the post says. Lots of times the title gets messed up, could be a language barrier, could be a mistake, could be other things. And generally when presented with something smaller vs something larger, it\u2019s more likely that the smaller thing is wrong than the larger one. Might be more errors in the longer one but a single error in the small one can completely ruin it, as it likely did here.", "So you just go through life assuming everything and never asking questions to clarify? \n\nDo you even understand what questions are for?", "Nope it actually isn't. I drink what I want as much as I want and don't have to put up with others sh!t. How often I read that guys have to pay huge bills as their guy friends take advantage of them. Or only order beer when the guy friends ordering the finest and most expensive stuff. Yeah that doesn't happen around here. \n\nIt's actually more relaxed.", "Not *then* but *before*\n\nMy point was not OP did something wrong I was referring to me not understanding her mothers reaction. \n\nI'd not teach my daughter to willingly accept drinks. I'd rather tell her to think upfront if she wants to deal with expectations or hopes that come with drinks and if not rather pay your own drinks. \n\nWhich is what OP tried anyways.", "Is that first question making an assumption that I make assumptions about everything and never ask questions? Everything and never are absolutes, and should\u2026 never be used unless 100% certain. Are you 100% certain that I ALWAYS assume and NEVER ask questions? \n\nTo answer your question, no I don\u2019t assume EVERYTHING, but generalizations can be good as they can make things quicker. I also ask questions quite frequently, idk where you got that idea. The issue with waiting for answers is that you\u2019re often waiting way longer than you should be, especially for simple matters. Questions are important for obtaining information, but when that information can either be obtained through research/other means, or assumed with net positive accuracy, the questions become unnecessary. \n\nLike for example, if someone makes a claim online, would it be more beneficial to ask them to show where they got their information, or do some digging to try finding it on your own? I think the latter is much better as you develop that research skill, learn way more than they could\u2019ve explained, AND you can always ask them later if you don\u2019t have conclusive findings.", "They aren\u2019t your friends if they take advantage of you lol. It\u2019s literally never been an issue with my friends.", "What a gross thing to explain to a daughter. \"Don't let a man buy you a drink ever if you're not going to put out. Its what he'll expect from you\". You know you just stated the exact reason women don't trust any man, right?", "Hahaha. So you don't understand what questions are. OK.   \n\nWell, questions are a sentence in an interrogative form, addressed to someone in order to get information in reply. They are always ended with a question mark.  \n\nAn assumption is a thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof. That sentence ends with a period, not a question mark. \n\nSince I used a question mark.  It was a question, a statement that needs more information. And not an assumption.  \n\nHope you learned a little something today.  \n\nHave a great evening.", "You don't say..."]}
