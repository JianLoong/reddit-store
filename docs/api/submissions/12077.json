Maybe enough for it to be a medical issue.", "NAH. It's understandable that you feel uncomfortable with your niece using your bathroom as a pit stop, but it doesn't sound like she's doing anything intentionally harmful or disrespectful. It's possible that she's more comfortable using your bathroom for whatever reason, or maybe she just doesn't like the bathrooms in her own apartment.\n\nSince you don't want to bring it up with her parents, one solution could be to talk to your niece directly and kindly let her know that while she's welcome to use the bathroom in your apartment, it's not a good idea to sneak in when you're not there and it's important to ask for permission first. You could also gently suggest that she try using the bathroom in her own apartment more often, especially if she's just using your bathroom as a pit stop.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether or not you're comfortable with her using your bathroom. If it really bothers you, you could consider setting some boundaries or limitations around when she can use your bathroom, or even suggesting that she use a bathroom in a public area of the building instead.", "NAH \nkids are weird, nothing you can really do about this one", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m protective of my own space, so I can understand why this bothers you. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not sure you can really complain about it. This IS your sibling  so just talk to them about how it bothers you? It\u2019s not weird to want to protect your space. They can talk to your niece and guide her back to her own bathroom.", "She is going to be so embarrassed about this someday!", "I mean, you know you don't have a reason for it and that it would sound unreasonable for you to complain about it, so unless you can figure out your reason, then you have your answer already.", "Is the bathroom in her place clean? Kids are hard to figure out. NAH though, poop is gross \ud83d\ude02", "Going to go against the grain here and say YTA.\n\nI don't know what you expect people to do in the bathroom, but pooping should definitely be on the list. Is this bathroom purely decorative or something? Are other people forbidden from pooping there?\n\nShe's not taking the bathroom from anyone else. She's not going there JUST to poop, she plays with your daughter every time.\n\nJust remind her to always flush and let the poor girl poop in peace.  She had one embarrassing incident/misunderstanding. She's ten. Let it go.", "NAH\n\n>it was just closer to access.

I would feel weird growing up if one of my friends did that constantly so NAH.\n\nMaybe it is because it takes her so long, if it is always 20 minutes, and she feels more comfortable.", "It\u2019s very possible.", "I personally know of 4 kids that have to drink miralax because of same thing. Helped immensely. Just mix with juice and she will be pooping in your bathroom in no time", "Of course there is. Just tell her that the new rule is \"go to the toilet if you're genuinely caught short here, but no more daily dumps at my house\".", "Appreciate your response. Yes of course she can use the bathroom as I mentioned I don\u2019t mind her using the bathroom. But she leaves her apartment walks past her bathrooms and comes to my apartment to use the bathroom before even approaching my daughter to  play and is in there for a long time. if it didn\u2019t happen every time I wouldn\u2019t think this was weird.", "If she had to go so bad it probably would be faster to go to her own apartment. She has to ring the doorbell wait for a response ask for permission when in that time she could\u2019ve gone two doors down to her own apartment. She doesn\u2019t appear to  have to use the bathroom urgently either, which If she did I could understand. And there\u2019s no consistency in terms of times of day.  she hadn\u2019t been over for the last month actually  just because my daughter has taken on some new activities and hasn\u2019t been home as often. She happened to have been home today and they hung out last night. The only consistent pattern is that it happens every time she does come over.", "Hmm..\n\nPersonally, I'm the type of parent who would go nuts if I couldn't sus out *why*, lol.\n\nI might try some more subtle (a little at a time) questioning.\n\nAre there more people in her house? Less privacy? Something in her bathrooms scares her?\n\nDoes she *know* that it's actually faster to go to her house?\n\nI'm sooooo curious about this now XD", "Yes there are more people over there. I can\u2019t see her own bathroom scaring her she uses it daily  and I\u2019m sure she poops there as well when we aren\u2019t home.  I guess the privacy may make sense or the assumption that it\u2019s faster to use our bathroom.", "Are the toilets the exact same? Sometimes height, shape, and angle of a toilet seat can make it more or less comfortable for anybody to try going number 2 but especially kids.", "I grew up in a pretty big household... and even if/when a bathroom was free there was someone in the hall banging on the door, rushing you... might be something like that?", "this is a strong possibility too... I was thinking it would be people rushing them, but that could do it too"]}
