They might 'notice' but probably won't say anything or make a stink about it.\n\nHopefully, lol.\n\nNo one has time for all the gift-giving anymore.  I mean, small kids, sure if you want, but if a family has small kids, stop giving to parents, give to kids. Then when no more kids, just give again to the 'family'.  No need for separate ones all around", "NTA.  Give a family gift. Like movie tickets, restaurant gift card.  In my world,  no thank you\u2019s, no gifts.", "NTA\n\nMovie tickets, family board games, zoo passes - so many options. Great idea.\n\n\u201cMy relatives expect separate gifts for each child and provide me with long lists for birthdays and holidays.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, start responding with long lists of your own.", "NTA. And yours is a good idea - one gift per family from you, of an equal monetary level with what they have been giving you.\n\nOr, you can start to provide them with long lists for birthdays and holidays.

Gifts are not what make Christmas, it\u2019s spending time with family.", "NTA. One holiday gift per family and birthday gifts for the under-18 kids is more than generous especially if the recipients do not send thank yous. DH and I are in the same boat as you.

Over 18 gets things like a big box of chocolate we split amongst us (4 adult siblings). \nIt\u2019s always been like that.

They are all extremely well off so gift giving for everyone was not a big deal for them. Like you, I received a \u201cfamily\u201d gift every year and I don\u2019t have children. One year, I finally spoke up and communicated, using a very soft and gentle approach, that I was not in a position to gift everyone but would gladly participate in a family drawing. My suggestion was well received and we haven\u2019t looked back. The family, in fact, came up with the added idea that only children up to 18 years of age would be included in the drawing and the kids could gift each other. I still give all families a small but thoughtful gift, such as a special candy, or a new ornament for their trees but that\u2019s about it.  Birthdays are a different matter. All nieces and nephews get a gift and, as an adult, I expect nothing in return. You are TA for taking an accounting of the Christmas gifts you have received but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an AH move to gift a family one gift. Items that they can share as a family such as movie passes, tickets to an event or a favorite restaurant gift card are all good choices.", "NTA.\n\nOne gift per kid for birthdays. Something like a family game for them to play per family for Christmas. And stop buying per their long lists.", "Nta.", "NTA honey! No way should you be responsible for gifting to everyone separately! One little gift basket per household, IF you feel like it. I'm thinking that a simple Christmas card from you would be just fine! They would be lucky to get a card if it were me!\n\nBirthday gift as well?? Nope!!! Do any of these people send you anything for your birthday??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
