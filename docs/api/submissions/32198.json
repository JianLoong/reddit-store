Before my ex-husband and I got divorced, we bought a new air-conditioning system for our house that we had. When we got divorced, the courts decided that it was a joint debt despite it being only on my credit. So the court ordered him to pay me 150$ a month to go towards the payment of the monthly bill until the unit is paid off. We currently have about 12ish months left of payments to make. I make the payment at the first of every month and he reimburses me within 10 business days of receipt of payment. That was our agreement. \n\nWell last month, he decided to inform me that he would make his half of the daycare payment and his half of our child's therapy payment, but he is actively choosing not to pay for his half of the ac unit due to him \"financing a new car and student loans going back into repayment\". This was said in text. At that point I made a decision, either he pays me all that is owed by December 31, 2023 or I will be taking him to small claims court/family court (depending on what court it falls under since its a family court order) and requesting to have his wages garnished since he is unable to be trustworthy with making his court ordered payments.\n\nI've decided this because I sold my house (i was able to prove the house was legally mine in the divorce because he never made a single payment towards it in the entirety of our marriage) a few months ago andbh attempted to sabotage the sale of my house by talking to the buyers realtor, the inspector, and quite honestly anyone who would listen about the \"problems with the house\". When that didn't work, he attempted to put a lein on my house because of \"an active debt attached to the house\". After the sale of the house, he begged me to use the proceeds from the sale to clear the debt and I told him no and that he would continue to pay me for his half and I wasn't going to let him wiggle his way out of it. Now we are here.\n\nSomeone did make it clear that I didn't state the moral delimma so here it is. My ex-husband has a track record of calling me a bitch or an asshole or my personal favourite \"heartless bitch\" for trying to get what is rightfully mine from him because it always manages to correlate when he's going through a rough patch. \n\nSo WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1701529255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1895ic8/wibta_for_taking_my_exhusband_to_small_claims/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
