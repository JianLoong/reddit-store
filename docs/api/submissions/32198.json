Before my ex-husband and I got divorced, we bought a new air-conditioning system for our house that we had. When we got divorced, the courts decided that it was a joint debt despite it being only on my credit. So the court ordered him to pay me 150$ a month to go towards the payment of the monthly bill until the unit is paid off. We currently have about 12ish months left of payments to make. I make the payment at the first of every month and he reimburses me within 10 business days of receipt of payment. That was our agreement. \n\nWell last month, he decided to inform me that he would make his half of the daycare payment and his half of our child's therapy payment, but he is actively choosing not to pay for his half of the ac unit due to him \"financing a new car and student loans going back into repayment\". This was said in text. At that point I made a decision, either he pays me all that is owed by December 31, 2023 or I will be taking him to small claims court/family court (depending on what court it falls under since its a family court order) and requesting to have his wages garnished since he is unable to be trustworthy with making his court ordered payments.\n\nI've decided this because I sold my house (i was able to prove the house was legally mine in the divorce because he never made a single payment towards it in the entirety of our marriage) a few months ago andbh attempted to sabotage the sale of my house by talking to the buyers realtor, the inspector, and quite honestly anyone who would listen about the \"problems with the house\". When that didn't work, he attempted to put a lein on my house because of \"an active debt attached to the house\". After the sale of the house, he begged me to use the proceeds from the sale to clear the debt and I told him no and that he would continue to pay me for his half and I wasn't going to let him wiggle his way out of it. Now we are here.\n\nSomeone did make it clear that I didn't state the moral delimma so here it is. My ex-husband has a track record of calling me a bitch or an asshole or my personal favourite \"heartless bitch\" for trying to get what is rightfully mine from him because it always manages to correlate when he's going through a rough patch. \n\nSo WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1701529255, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1895ic8/wibta_for_taking_my_exhusband_to_small_claims/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone is welcome.  Even people who don't read or follow the rules.  Just don't expect to ...", "I'm a family lawyer and I feel like there's a decent chance your ex got screwed in the divorce settlement. A airconditioning unit that added value to a home that was determined to be solely yours was termed a marital debt and even though when you sold the home you would have received a higher price because of the unit he still gets stuck paying for the unit. I don't agree with some divorce settlements, a value add to a property only one party owns should not have been determined a marital debt. \n\nMaybe there are other clauses in the settlement that favour him - I don't know - but given what a small amount of money this is do you really think it's worth going back to court. You file, he counters, you both spend more on lawyers than the aircon unit and your children are the ultimate losers. You do realise you need to co-parent for a long time right?", "But you sold the air conditioner with the house? You\u2019re asking someone to pay for a product that you already sold and likely profited off of? You should\u2019ve had an adjuster state the diminished value when you sold the house and had him pay half of that.\nHe sucks for trying to invade the sale of your house, you sick for trying to get double paid for something. He might not have paid the house payment, but do ask yourself if his income offset your responsibilities to allow to make the payments in full from your income? It does sound like he paid for improvements on the house from his income.\n\nESH.", "I am not a lawyer, but morally YTA. You made him take on a debt for a house he didn\u2019t own/doesn\u2019t benefit from. Then, you decided to sell the house and profit off of it while he didn\u2019t, yet you still think he should pay for the A/C? He\u2019s right, you should\u2019ve used the profits from the sale to pay off that debt.", "YTA. He might be a dick in general, but you\u2019re an asshole here. You sold the house incl. the AC  and pocketed the profits from it. And then you didn\u2019t even pay off the AC?! You want him to keep making payments on something you installed in YOUR house, sold and made a profit from. You\u2019re extremely petty and no matter what went before it I get a feeling you\u2019re both toxic. Pay it off and move on.", "Depending where you are located, you\u2019d likely be better taking him to family court for contempt for his failure to abide to the order / to enforce the order.\n\n**disclaimer this is not legal advice. Consult with an attorney or the laws of your state regarding such issues.", "NTA, he was ordered to pay, either he pays or he can have yet another judge tell him he has to pay you back.", "NTA.  I'd email him a reminder of the court agreement.  Then if he doesn't pay go to small claims court.", "YWNBTA  \nHe must be exhausting to deal with. Good luck.", "So....about the car payment and school repayment...yours or his school?", "NTA\n\nYou already have a judgement though.  So if he doesn\u2019t pay what is court ordered, just file the paperwork to garnish.", "He didn't get screwed. I was pro se in the divorce while he had an attorney. I didn't fight in the divorce. I got the house, and my car and my personal belongings. He doesn't pay child support because we have 50/50 custody. I do not get alimony. He got the entire contents of the house because I moved into a fully furnished home. We had agreed under the table that he would pay me half of the 1100$ living room set that I paid cash for, and he reneged on the agreement not even 3 months into his tenant in the home. I rented the home to him for a year at a loss and gave him 4 months notice that I did not want to renew his lease because the tenant/landlord relationship was causing a strain on the co-parenting relationship. He broke his lease immediately and I had to sell my house fast because I was literally bleeding money during the selling process. The attorney told him that I gave him a very good settlement in terms of divorce.", "She sold the house not the a/c", "Car payment is his. School repayment is also his. My car is paid for and student loan debt repayment is 0 for me at the moment.", "So he's constantly screwing something up....hmmm.\n\nTake him to court and don't feel bad for the constant screw up - it takes dedication to go from crisis to crisis.", "This is not a moral dilemma. This is him being an AH and not fulfilling his adult obligations. He can call you whatever he wants...that's on him. He needs to pay his bills. Life happens, and I am no stranger to having multiple things go wrong at once for me. But I don't go around name calling and berating others because of my circumstances. 1000% take him to court for this. He has been court ordered and is not abiding by that court order. Garnishment is the way to go now.\n\nETA...NTA", "An $1100 dining set second hand is maybe worth $200 and since you both need to wear the depreciation your half is only $100. So I have no sympathy that he reneged on a deal that was so in your favour. As for the rest of it, I don't see anything that would cause a lawyer to say he got a good deal. You appear to have received the only asset of value and you have split custody so why would there be a child support order. Regarding the lease, once you notify a tenant they need to leave because you won't be renewing I think it's accepted that you will release them as soon as they find a place to live. You say you wanted them out because it effected your co-parenting but then complain that they left. You can't have it both ways.\n\nI really think you should let the aircon unit go. You got money for it in the sale of the house that you otherwise would not have received. You need to co-parent for a long time together and filing over frivolous amounts like this is not going to improve the situation. Sure he hasn't upheld the divorce agreement in full, but it's a tiny thing and honestly it's far more valuable to have it in your back pocket as an example of you being flexible for future custody matters than it would be to go through the effort to forcefully collect the amount.", "I\u2019ve never heard of someone uninstalling a home A/C and taking it with them\u2026..", "So basically what you're saying is that I should bear the full cost of the debt that we both agreed to while we were MARRIED just because he decided he doesn't want to pay it anymore? That it's perfectly fine for him to duck out on something that he agreed to pay during our divorce negotiations but now he's backing out because he bit off more than he e could chew?", "You got paid for the air-conditioning unit. Your house was worth more because it was installed. You aren't losing the full value of the item because you already got paid for it because it increased the value of your house and I absolutely believe that the combination of the increase in home value plus the payments already made would cover the total of the unit. I don't think you are losing money in actual terms. What you would be losing is additional profit and personally and professionally I think it's dumb to further tank an antagonist co-parenting situation over such a frivolous amount of money.\n\nAlso, your exs lawyer isn't great. It's foolish to agree to take on the debt for an asset the other party is awarded in the divorce."]}
