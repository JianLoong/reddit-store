In fact, in the past 5 years we texted each other once. We also come from a very small family. She and I are the last \u201ckids\u201d. Besides us, there\u2019s only 4 other people left. I\u2019m not close to our grandfather either. I moved away when I was 20 and have seen him twice in that time and haven\u2019t seen him at all since our grandmother passed.\n\nSeveral years ago, my cousin married someone of a different race and had kids. I don\u2019t have a problem with any of this and to be honest, I don\u2019t even think about her or her family so you can say I\u2019m indifferent to the entire thing. However, our grandfather is super racist. He thinks it\u2019s an abomination so he cut her and her family completely out of his will. He even cut out her mother (his daughter) because she supported the marriage. He told them what he was doing and told them several other things I can\u2019t put here. They haven\u2019t spoken to each other since the day.\n\nRecently he had a health scare and had to stay in the hospital for a few weeks. My mom (his other daughter) took care of him and because of his advanced age, is working with his attorney to put things in order. This is when the inheritance issue resurfaced because he really did disinherit my aunt, cousin, and that entire family. This means the only people left in his will are me, my mom, and 2 others. \n\nMy cousin, aunt, and their family have been trying to rally us to stand against our grandfather to either change his will or for us to denounce his inheritance because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t want to because I need the money. I don\u2019t have to agree with his world views but I have bills to pay and with the predicted economic downturn, his money will be a safety net if I lose my job. I told my cousin all of this and she thinks I\u2019m a racist AH. I tried telling her I\u2019m not and I just care about the money. She said if that\u2019s the case, I should stand with her to force him to change his will. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll work out like she has it in her head.\n\nBTW, we\u2019re not talking about millions and I\u2019m not going to be able to play tennis with Elon Musk at the country club.
