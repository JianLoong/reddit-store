Imagine you started telling stories about her insecure moments, even without being a sad drunk. She would not find that very funny, would she?\n\nYou guys should look into couples counselling, rither she really is A or B or just genuinely doesn't care if she hurts you.", "NTA\n\nYour wife was inappropriate and needs to perhaps not drink in public if this is the outcome.\n\nYou couldn't leave her there because she'd get drunker and tell more stories.\n\nBut the difficulty is where you go from here.  If your wife won't change her behaviour then you have some difficult decisions to make as your are constant fodder for her stories.", "Nta. If wife can\u2019t behave herself in public while drinking, she shouldn\u2019t be drinking in public. Your boundary of no sex chats to family is more than reasonable.", "NTA. And she has a drinking problem. She drank when she knew she shouldn't, and she acted like she knew she would act when drunk, and it upset you like she knew it would. There are no surprises here. You were 100% within your rights to haul her off with you at that point, and you need to start looking into signs of alcoholism and such. If she's normally just self-centered and rude, then make sure to keep a nice long list of every embarrassing thing you can think of that SHE has done and return fire. This isn't the first time, or second, or third time...sounds like she's done this a lot and you've gotten angry with her a lot (and with reason). Returning fire may be the only way to make her realize that she can't do this...even if it doesn't bother her ethically to embarrass you, self-preservation may make her shut up.", "NTA.  You are a good husband to wrap up your tipsy wife and get her out of there before she embarrasses you and *her* any further.\n\nI heard this once and I agree with it.  *If you look around a family celebration and you cannot figure out who the annoying drunk is... that means it is you.*  Or in this case Olivia.\n\nYour family was prolly relieved that you scooped up Olivia and took her home.  She needs to get a grip on how alcohol/family affects her.  Sorry to be so harsh.", "NTA.\n\nShe can get drunk if she wants. You can decide if that is a marriage-threatening problem.\n\nWhat she doesn't get to do, is to embarrass you in front of her friends. She does \\*not\\* get to tell stories about your embarrassing sex moments.\n\nOne big thing that a lot of people in relationships forget is that often stories are not theirs to tell. They don't get to reveal stuff about \\*you\\*. They can reveal stuff about themselves all they like, but they don't get to tell stories about \\*you\\*.", "NTA. You knew before you even went in there it was her acting a fool. Sounds like this is a bit deeper and you guys need to have a discussion about boundaries and her behavior when drinking.", "Your wife has a problem with alcohol.  Full stop.  Please look into Al-anon or some sort of support program for the loved ones of alcoholics.  Seriously.  Educate yourself, please.  It may not make you any happier, but you\u2019ll be prepared for whatever happens next.\n\nShe may not be a full blown alcoholic, but any addiction counselor would label her as having a problem with alcohol.  \n\nAlcoholics can only stop drinking when they are ready.  I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic (almost 16 years sober).  I knew I had a problem but wasn\u2019t able to stop until I was fully ready on my own.  Most fortunately for me, that happened safely at home and not after drunk driving or putting other people in harm\u2019s way.\n\nLooking back, I was a slave to alcohol, as any recovering addict can tell you.  I had no control and made a lot of bad decisions because of my addiction.  It was also a way to self medicate when I was under resourced (a line stolen directly from my therapist but it helped me understand a lot of the why\u2019s?).  I was lucky that my husband and family didn\u2019t give up on me.  Fortunately (if one could call it that), I just slurred my words and fell asleep at parties when I\u2019d had too much to drink.  I\u2019m horrified by thinking about how embarrassing this all was for my husband and friends, though.  My full sympathies for what you are dealing with and you are NTA!\n\nI hope for both your sakes that she\u2019s not a full blown alcoholic yet and is able to put down that bottle on her own.  If not, I hope she can avoid burning bridges until she is ready to get help.  It can\u2019t be forced on her.  My sympathies are with both of you.  With her because I know what it is like to have no control over something so bad for me. With you because you have to stand on the sidelines and watch her in this battle and deal with the fallout.", "NTA.  But that's what you get when you marry a child.  She needs to grow up.", "NTA. your wife has an alcohol problem. please talk to her sober about this.", "NTA. You saved her from having embarrassing conversations she might regret later. In the moment, while drunk, it's understandable why she'd be mad you were dragging her away from the fun. \n\nBut in the clear light of day, if she is still mad at you, something is wrong. She says you embarrassed her. Maybe that's because she is embarrassed she might have a drinking problem.\n\nThe alternative is that she enjoys embarrassing you, which is just as detrimental to a relationship.", "I\u2019m an alcoholic so take this with a grain of salt. It\u2019s up to her and her alone to say if she needs help BUT I see some huge red flags. A) She trampled your boundaries. B) She drank to excess and told embarrassing stories in order to be the \u201clife of the party.\u201d C) She got argumentative when called on her bad behavior. D) Most importantly, she does this repeatedly. \nThere\u2019s definitely issues there and you need to stand firm in not tolerating it. A trip to an AA meeting wouldn\u2019t hurt her. She might hear something that strikes a chord.", "NTA.     \n\n\nAnd my dude....she's got an alcohol problem.", "NTA at all\n\nYour wife sounds horrible", "NTA- good lord, why are you still married to someone who goes out of her way to embarrass you and be inappropriately sexual around your family members? Having too much wine really isn\u2019t an excuse at 28.", "I'm willing to bet that no one in the room really wanted to hear what your wife was spewing.\n\nWe've all been at gatherings with the drunk who overshares. The wine!Aunt stereotype hasn't helped. It's very rarely funny, mostly it's a train wreck and everyone just pities whoever has to take them home.\n\nYour wife has no respect for you OP, I'm sorry. Have you ever thought about what she's saying when she goes out and drinks with other people and you're not around to stop her airing your personal stuff? \ud83d\ude2c\n\nNTA", "NTA", "ESH she shouldn't have told the story.

She is using being drunk as an excuse to share stories and embarrass you.", "NTA \nYour sex life is between the two of you, and if you've asked her not to tell people about it, she should  respect that, particularly with your family.

I know I probably shouldn\u2019t have yelled though.", "More than just fodder, she completely doesn\u2019t  respect her husband. She also clearly can\u2019t judge a room.. Sex stories to your and your partners families are highly inappropriate.", "\n\n\nWhile I agree being equally petty is an easy option, why would you want to stay in a relationship with someone who clearly doesn\u2019t respect your very understandable boundaries.", "And this instance, it wasn't even her friends - it was their parents and older relatives!  As bad as being an unwilling participant in a Carrie Bradshaw style conversation would be, dropping embarrassing sex stories at a family dinner is just beyond the pale.", "28 is no longer a child.", "E) she\u2019s not just argumentative in the moment, she\u2019s doing it the next day as well.", "He handled it perfectly, and he should in fact no longer attend these functions with her if she refuses to respect his boundaries regarding personal matters. As someone has already stated she is either an alcoholic ( or someone who cannot handle alcohol in the least) or simply doesn\u2019t respect her husband. She is clearly the only AH in this situation.", "So, because she's under 30, it's acceptable to become drunk at a family gathering and start spewing embarrassing sex stories? Nobody wants to hear that about their son/nephew, and she needs to know her own limits to respect time, place, and others' boundaries - no matter her age.", "I get that you escalated, but if this is not the first time she's done this, I can see the fabric wearing thin.\n\nThis can grow into a huge problem for your marriage and is obviously also turning ou into a person you don't want to be, like the yelling.", "It's not like you immediately yelled. You did try to resolve the situation calmly at first. Maybe show her this post? A bunch of strangers with no dog in this race are all saying the same thing, that she has a problem with alcohol. Maybe this will be the wake-up call she needs to get it under control", "But there is a huge difference between sharing these things with friends versus sharing with your parents and older relatives. I would guess they really don't want to hear about your sex life, any more than you want to hear about theirs.", "Don\u2019t feel bad. Honestly crack down on this now.

Who talks about their marital sex with their inlaws? It's just weird.  Does she think she's Carrie from Sex and the City or something?", "Absolutely.  It's completely inappropriate.\n\nThe only consideration is that when she is drinking her inhibitions are gone and you can argue she's not in her right mind and has no filter as to what she is saying.  It's an explanation but it's not an excuse when she continues doing it.\n\nThe only real solution here is for her not to drink when in public because who knows what she will say?", "Good point. But this may be a fixable bad-habit sort of issue if she's willing to admit she's wrong and work on herself. If not, yeah, I'd question the relationship too. Some people won't straighten up until they get it back in the teeth or realize their behavior is going to cost them their SO.", "Times have changed. 28 isn't a child, but it's not a mature adult either, unfortunately.

It sounds to me like she is just a giant brat, which isn't society's fault, but her own fault.", "Being an adult has nothing to do with earning a living. It has to do with growing up, taking responsibility for how you act, and becoming a contributing member of your social relationships instead of a complete leech.

I had the brat phase... when I was a child. It didn't serve me well. Learned from it. Moved on. Why? Discipline. My parents actually did their job. The only adults I see acting like this usually were babied all their life, or have insane parental issues. Besides... I will probably never drink myself into a stupor, nor do I drink much in public, if at all. It sounds more to me like this is a child trapped in an adult woman's body, and it is either her parents failing at their jobs, or her being too dumb to realize that being a brat won't serve her. But then again, unlike this woman, I have self control. She clearly doesn't at 28, and that is absolutely baffling.", "Right, but there's more obnoxious things to do other than getting drunk, and you don't have enough time or money to do them right now. You think you have self control, and you might! But I'm just warning you that much of the self control people in your situation think they have turns out to have been just a lack of opportunity, and they get blind sided by it lol", "In this shitty economy? I probably won't ever have the time or money until I am old enough to think that drinking in general is stupid. And I will probably be too busy with a family at that point. Er go, I will ensure that I am  not able to... you know, Idle hands are the devil's playthings.", "Nta", "NTA I think you need to read up on alcoholism. Your wife clearly cannot control her alcohol intake, to the detriment of her marriage. That is a worrying sign, and you are right to be concerned. She is destroying your trust in her, and the moment that trust is gone, so is the relationship. She needs to know this, she needs to know that you think she has an alcohol problem, and she needs to know what you will do about it if it continues, be that counselling (marriage and/or addiction) or even divorce.", "People in their 20s can develop alcohol addiction and that should not be made light of or encouraged. Alcohol dependence isn\u2019t \u201cpaying the price of dating someone younger\u201d it is an addiction.", "My ex friend used to do this with her partner, well that was until Mike started mentioning embarrassing things about her.\n\nEvery time she starts saying crap, but in and start embarrassing her.

It doesn't seem that she cares about your boundaries.", "NTA - but everyone diagnosing OPs wife as an alcoholic need to simmer down. It\u2019s a holiday and she drank too much. Its happened to a lot of us. No, she shouldn\u2019t be pissed at you for removing her from the situation and making sure she doesn\u2019t say anything else embarrassing. But saying she\u2019s an alcoholic is a stretch.", "NTA she ruined things by being a sloppy drunk. Having to babysit drunk people is also not fun. I\u2019m experiencing some secondhand embarrassment here. Her behavior, yikes.
