If they wanted you there they should have scheduled the meeting for a day you were working.  Your time is your time.  We don't have enough time off as it is, they don't need to take more of it. We all need some attempt at work/life balance.", "NTA\n\nI bet they didn't want to pay you, too.", "NTA - a day off is just that. Unless you're getting additional pay or time off to compensate you for coming in you have no obligation to do so.", "NTA. It's your day off. That means you are not at work. Period. You can't care more than they do.", "NTA. If you aren\u2019t getting paid, don\u2019t go. It\u2019s not your fault your co-workers are unable to stand up to unreasonable requests on their time", "LOL NTA it\u2019s your day off you don\u2019t have to go in", "NTA. Just because everyone does it doesn't mean you have to. If they're fine with doing unpaid labor on their days off, then that's on them. You have boundaries and you enforced those boundaries.", "NTA. It's not your fault your coworkers suck up to a company that would replace them within a week and it's your supervisors fault for not scheduling the meeting a day where everyone could attend.", "NTA\nunless you were told it was mandatory AND that they would pay you for coming in for the meeting, then you absolutely do not have to do unpaid work.", "NTA. If they're are being weird that's their issue not yours. \n\nMaybe you could have called in on the phone but unless it was all days off are canceled be here for this meeting I wouldn't have gone in either.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhat part of \"day off\" is hard to understand for them?", "NTA you can't get in trouble for not coming in unless it was a mandatory meeting. And if it was considered mandatory they have to pay you being there", "NTA\n\nYour supervisor, who I assume either approved or know of your time off, scheduled a meeting on your day off.  If you had attended, would you have been paid?  Probably not.  Also, was it like a zoom meeting or an in-person.  If it's in-person, then you are doubling NTA for not going to work on your scheduled day off.", "NTA to skipping all meetings that should've been emails.  Especially when they are on your day off.", "Way NTA. It\u2019s taken me a looong time (much more than I\u2019d care to admit) to realise that:\n\na) they need to take \u201c no\u201d as the answer or if they don\u2019t b) I\u2019m away/unfortunately suddenly in Mexico (I\u2019ve always wanted to visit)/have a health appointment etc\n\nOr c/ if you have a Union I\u2019m sure they would be interested", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Never sacrifice home time for a corporation.", "INFO: What information was covered at this wildly important meeting?", "INFO\n\nHow far in advance were you told of the meeting?\n\nWere you told it was mandatory?\n\nIs this any type of health care facility?", "Was the meeting mandatory? \n\nDid they say how much time you'd be paid for? An hour? Four? \n\nIf none of the above don't worry about it. \n\nNTA. \n\nGod I hate meetings.", "Was the meeting about who keeps stealing food out of the break room.", "Would they have paid you for the time spent in the meeting? If not then don't feel bad. Either way NTA. You get two days to yourself a week. You give the company 5 days a week out of your life. You don't owe anyone anything. The whole point of a weekend/scheduled day off is so you can decompress and not think about work.", "One of the best parts about working nights for 4 years (other than not having to deal with people or talk to coworkers) was never having to go to a single meeting during that time. Never sacrifice your personal time for a work meeting unless you have to AND there's free food.", "If OP is in the US they would be required to pay the OP for attending the meeting particularly if the meeting is designated mandatory.\n\nI have never had a job where I wasn't paid for meeting attendance even if it was on my day off. I am nearly old enough to retire.", "NTA but \u2026 you\u2019re lucky you even have any kind of choice. There are some misconceptions in the comments here, or perhaps people who just haven\u2019t had the same experiences. I speak as a person who has worked for many companies over my lifetime.\n\nYou (legally) have to be paid for time worked, regardless of the day, the time, or the task.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for companies to schedule meetings on *someone\u2019s* day off, particularly if it\u2019s a large company. Choosing any of the seven days in a week to conduct a meeting, it\u2019s bound to be *someone\u2019s* day off. \n\nI worked for one of the biggest, richest, most recognizable companies in the world, one that did not have a \u201cclosed\u201d day every week. Our (mandatory) meetings were usually on Sundays. Whether it was a normal day off for a person or not, every employee was required and expected to be there\u2026 and also if it was hours before or hours after a shift the very same day. \u201cYou work at 9am? Great, be here at 7am for this two hour meeting, then work your normal 8 hour shift.\u201d Yes, it sucked. The only exception was if the employee had a vacation during that time, that had been approved prior to the setting of the meeting date. Otherwise, you got written up, got your schedule screwed up on purpose as punishment, and ostracized for the next month. \n\nI am fortunate enough that I retired very early, so I don\u2019t have to tolerate shitty companies and their shitty managers anymore. Now I plant flowers and hang out with my pup. Best to you.", "Nta. It\u2019s your day off. I refuse to do any work, go to any meeting or trainings in my day off. I am not getting paid for them so I don\u2019t care how much I may need those trainings that\u2019s a hard no from me. I don\u2019t care that there is paperwork due and it\u2019s not done. They want me at a meeting they can record it and let me watch it during work time. They want paperwork on time they can pay me over time or hire enough people so that I actually have time to do it. Work does not go home with me no matter how much they hint that it should. I am hourly not salary. My time is important I get two days to rest and I use those two days to rest.", "NTA. Your supervisor doesn't value your time or employment contract, and your co-worker seem to have succumbed to crabs-in-bucket syndrome.", "NTA. Rest is critical to humans, you did exactly the right thing. If your bosses don't like it, they can schedule meetings for when people are in.", "NTA duh, your day off is your day off and people can\u2019t intrude on it. It might be nice to go but it is your choice.", "NTA If they offered overtime penalties for that day it might have been worth considering but definitely do not go in on a day off for a meeting", "NTA tell your co workers if they wanna give up their life's then that's on them. However scheduling a meeting and thinking I'm coming in is laughable. If it was important send an email.", "NTA you\u2019re not getting paid and time off is to relax and recuperate.", "Work once asked me to come in 2 hours before my shift for a meeting, which they said was mandatory. I told them I'm happy for the overtime. Suddenly I didn't need to be at the meeting.", "If you\u2019re a salaried employer they do not have to. So long as it works out you are not being paid less than the minimum wage when dividing your salary by amount of hours actually worked.", "ESH.  \"Bitten the bullet\"", "NTA OP.\n\nYour most precious commodity is time, and you do not owe your employer your free time.\n\nIf they demand it, insist on premium fees for it.  (overtime rates, et cetera)", "NTA but youre gonna be punished for this, in your company it seems like this kind of behaviour is pretty normal", "NTA. This might be illegal.", "NTA. It's your day off.", "NTA. Your coworkers are tools and you don't have to be", "NTA.  If they wanted you there, they should have made it clear and then offered you time off in lieu.", "NTA", "NTA at all, it's your day off. the others are just a bunch of suckers who live and die for the job.", "why do I get U.S.A vibes?\n\nNTA", " Just because everyone does it doesn't mean you have to.

I'm still entitled to my time off.", "Man that sounds real bad, glad that shit doesn't fly here, when we take our 4 weeks off we are 100% off. If we can't be at the meeting we just get an email with all the info we missed.", "I\u2019ve worked Night Shift for 10 years. I didn\u2019t go to any meetings for the first 8 years. Then our new manager started adding meeting attendance to our yearly review which gives us our raise. So now I attend them via zoom. I don\u2019t participate in the meeting and then I put in my hour so I can get paid for it.", "I wasn't so fortunate. We were expected to come in an hour early for the meeting (Unpaid). On top of that, the people I took over from were also in that meeting, so the machines that I took over from were left running and unmonitored.\n\nEnded up with an hours worth of parts all over the floor that they made my responsibility. Took three meetings before I learned to stand up for myself and tell them to kick rocks. After that day, any parts not made on my shift or made during my break that they refused to cover were thrown in the skip."]}
