Imagine you're telling your boss that you're organizing a fishing trip tomorrow, despite it being a working day. How will they react?\n\nNTA obviously. You don't have to work on your day off.", "NTA\n\nI have literally refused to go to meetings because they were two hours before my shift so the managers could go home early.\n\nI told them they can either pay me triple time or have the meetings during my actual shift otherwise they can fuck off.", "NTA They scheduled a meeting on your day off.  If they wanted you there they should have scheduled the meeting for a day you were working.  Your time is your time.  We don't have enough time off as it is, they don't need to take more of it. We all need some attempt at work/life balance.", "NTA\n\nI bet they didn't want to pay you, too.", "NTA - a day off is just that. Unless you're getting additional pay or time off to compensate you for coming in you have no obligation to do so.", "NTA. It's your day off. That means you are not at work. Period. You can't care more than they do.", "NTA. If you aren\u2019t getting paid, don\u2019t go. It\u2019s not your fault your co-workers are unable to stand up to unreasonable requests on their time", "LOL NTA it\u2019s your day off you don\u2019t have to go in", "NTA. Just because everyone does it doesn't mean you have to. If they're fine with doing unpaid labor on their days off, then that's on them. You have boundaries and you enforced those boundaries.", "NTA. It's not your fault your coworkers suck up to a company that would replace them within a week and it's your supervisors fault for not scheduling the meeting a day where everyone could attend.", "NTA\nunless you were told it was mandatory AND that they would pay you for coming in for the meeting, then you absolutely do not have to do unpaid work.", "NTA. If they're are being weird that's their issue not yours. \n\nMaybe you could have called in on the phone but unless it was all days off are canceled be here for this meeting I wouldn't have gone in either.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhat part of \"day off\" is hard to understand for them?", "NTA you can't get in trouble for not coming in unless it was a mandatory meeting. And if it was considered mandatory they have to pay you being there", "NTA\n\nYour supervisor, who I assume either approved or know of your time off, scheduled a meeting on your day off.  If you had attended, would you have been paid?  Probably not.  Also, was it like a zoom meeting or an in-person.  If it's in-person, then you are doubling NTA for not going to work on your scheduled day off.", "NTA to skipping all meetings that should've been emails.  Especially when they are on your day off.", "Way NTA. It\u2019s taken me a looong time (much more than I\u2019d care to admit) to realise that:\n\na) they need to take \u201c no\u201d as the answer or if they don\u2019t b) I\u2019m away/unfortunately suddenly in Mexico (I\u2019ve always wanted to visit)/have a health appointment etc\n\nOr c/ if you have a Union I\u2019m sure they would be interested", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If not then don't feel bad. Either way NTA. You get two days to yourself a week. You give the company 5 days a week out of your life. You don't owe anyone anything.
