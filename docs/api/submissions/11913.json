If it was a matter of him already having a new place but there was a set time in between his lease being up and the new lease starting, I'd say it would be the nice thing to do, and shouldn't negatively impact you much. But its never a good idea to take someone in for an undetermined amount of time, especially when you really dont have the room them, or know them well. \n\nThe fact that she offered before speaking to you is why its NTA and not N A H.

Some places have 10 day limits on visitors, some are 14. Legally, it really depends. And morally, she needs to get the a-okay from whomever she's living with.
