I called her and she said she was staying at a friend and would come after breakfast.\n\nI was going to meet my friends at that afternoon. I waited until the time I had to leave the house and she didn't show up. I called her and she said she was on her way now. I told her that I had to leave and I would take our daughter to my sister. She asked me to wait a little longer, but I was in a hurry.\n\nI took our daughter to my sister and told her that my wife would pick her up in half an hour. She gladly agreed. My sister and wife are not on very good terms, they don't usually get along and don't like each other. But I didn't think it would be a problem, after all, she wouldn't even have to go into her house. She was only going to pick up our daughter.\n\nWhen I came home in the evening, she got cross at me about it. Asked me why I made her see my sister. I told her that she was overreacting, which I think she was really doing. She was also very annoyed that I left our daughter with a \"stranger\". That stranger is my sister, and she loves her niece very much. I knew she would take care of our daughter very well.\n\nShe told me that parenting is a two-person job and I shouldn't let people see our daughter that she doesn't approve of.

Parents getting time with friends is super important and supporting each other doing that is also super important. \n\nBut it is *not* ok to stay out far longer than planned, not call, and then get pissed off when the partners you\u2019ve stranded has to make arrangements. Your wife created this situation, not you, and she should be grateful your sister was willing to help out. \n\nNTA.", "NTA -Your wife spent the night hitting the bars and then spent the night with her friend.

It appears you are spending more time with your daughter than your wife, perhaps she\u2019s the stranger to your child.", "NTA. Why are you putting up with this? Your wife doesn't see you as her partner, but as her babysitter.

Parenting is a two person job, when both parents are present!
