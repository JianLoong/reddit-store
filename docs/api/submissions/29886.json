You don\u2019t owe your mother anything, do not fall for the guilt tripping.\n\nAnd congratulations on creating the life you want to live.    Well done!", "NTA. Everyone who tries guilttripping you could spend her Money. You had a horrible childhood because she chooses money over you so no way- spend your Money to whatever you want and stay nc", "NTA You don\u2019t owe people shit unless it\u2019s signed contracts and actual debts, tell her to piss off.", "Second house down payment? Is your mother out of her head? NTA. Block her calls and stop stressing over her. If she can afford a second home she better get used to not using you like a piggy bank anymore.\n\nI am grateful to and have been well blessed in my relationship with my mom. But, I ain't trying to buy her a second home so she can get some rental income. Good grief.", "NTA\n\nYour mom chose to have children, you did not chose to be born. She did nothing that deserves gratitude beyond breeding which even a cockroach can do.\n\nUse your money in whatever ways makes you happy. Block her and when her family members contact you tell them they can help her, then block them.", "Nta, block the new/fake number and tell her flying monkeys they're welcome to join her in no contact land.\n\nHave you checked out r/raisedbynarcissists? I'm 27 and it was such a nice place to be when I was cutting contact with my family", "NTA.  Stand your ground.  Block any family members that call.", "You are not the asshole for choosing to spend your money the way you want, especially after experiencing a challenging upbringing. Your financial decisions should be yours, and you have the right to prioritize your own life and future.", "NTA. Kudos to you for making the life you now have - you\u2019ve earned it. Your mother was/is financially abusive and sounds - frankly - like a walking red flag parade. You owe her nothing, and I think most of us would be horrified if you gave her a penny!", "NTA I don't know what country you live in, but I think a 14 year old having to pay rent to a parent and pay for their own food and clothing is illegal. Tell your mom she owes you!!  Cut her and her greedy relatives off.  You deserve better!", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a horror story mom. You know you are doing the right thing, so don't worry about it. If she had enough money to invest in a rental property to rent out then she doesn't need any money from you.", "NTA\n\nTell the flying monkeys that she made you pay rent as a child and that's more than enough housing money from you.", "NTA just block her number again", "NTA I love how your relatives say you should be giving your mom mobey for raising you when she didn't even raise you. Keep having fun vacations and giving any extra money to yourself since you raised yourself!", "Tell her to get the money of her stepson who she helped go no contact with her and her side of the family who let her treat u that way growing up enjoy ur life u deserve to only look after urself spending ur money on what you want", "Don't give her money! She treated you like crap.\n\nSide note: I would love to know your full story. Sounds engaging.", "NTA\n\nYou ARE ungrateful! It is true. But it isnt your problem. \n\nYour mom did a crappy job with you. You are now an adult and making your own living. You already came up with your solution to the mom issue, keep up the no contact. \n\nYour mom's job was to support you, not the other way around. Let her keep her finance her lifestyle, while you finance your own. That is what she taught you. In fact, tell her you are grateful for THAT!", "NTA.  The ones who cry \u201cungrateful\u201c are often the least worthy of gratitude.", "You were financially abused. Parents are legally obliged to pay for their childrens' food, clothing, shelter, education ...\n\nNTA, but cut her off for good, and surround yourself with people who care.", " NTA Tell her that she has no right to demand any money from you, when she refused to provide you with money and already made you pay rent from the age of 14, when she was supposed to be responsible for you but chose to support her stepson instead. \nAs such due to this, she can hit her perfect stepson up for a deposit on her new home instead.", "She did not even give you the basics she was required to give you as a parent ie food, clothing and school supplies.\n\nI would give the same treatment to anyone pressuring you to give your mother money as you do to her.

So, how is it \u201cfinancially responsible\u201d for you to gift (cause you know you\u2019ll never see it again) 30k to your mother?  You aren\u2019t going to make any money on HER investment.  It\u2019s a second home, so mom can\u2019t even cry that she will be homeless.  Save up for your own home, in fact turn the tables and demand your mom give you the money she saved so you can buy a house, that mom can\u2019t visit, and the money won\u2019t be returned.", "OP, You already KNOW you are NTA- Your Mother neglected you, she should have been prosecuted for child Neglect! BLOCK EVERYONE associated with your Mother and Live Your Life! She/They don't deserve a second of your time, energy, and most definitely NOT YOUR MONEY!", "NTA. Block her and go treat yourself to something extravagant that you always dreamed of having as a kid but were denied", "And abused op by stealing her money. She made her pay rent At 14!!! Y o . Legally the mother was obligated to pay for op till at least 18. NTA op keep blocking after telling them if they are so concerned to put some money themselves for that home"]}
