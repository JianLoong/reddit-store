He is taking the \"my house, my rules,\" approach, and in his mind, he has a set of expectations for you, and a different set of expectations for him.", "INFO: Is it a co-signed lease or does this guy actually own the house?\n\nOr is he the actual renter, and you and his sister are subtenants?", "NTA. Where I live tenants have the right to 'quiet enjoyment' which means the landlord can't do things which interfere with reasonable peace or comfort or privacy of the tenant. You may want to look into the laws in your area.", "NTA\n\nThis really depends on the location you live in.  \n\nInfo?\n\nHowever, assuming you are in the United States.  Federal and the supreme court have established what is know as  Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment. \n\nThe covenant of quiet enjoyment protects tenants from disturbance from a landlord, or an individual acting on the landlord\u2019s behalf, by providing the tenant with the right to use the rental for its intended purpose. It is important to note that the covenant of quiet enjoyment is not a promise that the landlord will prevent all noise disturbances on the premises.\n\nHowever, if the noise disturbance grows to a level where the tenant is unable to use the premise as a residence, then the covenant of if the landlord does not remedy the problem.  They can be sued for the cost of relocation and possibly the difference in the higher cost of your rent for the remainder of the original lease term with the labdlord. \n\nGenerally speaking, there are five basic tenant rights that are protected by the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Those five basic tenant rights are:\n\nThe Right to Privacy: In short, a tenant has the right to be left alone. The covenant of quiet enjoyment protects a tenant\u2019s right to privacy by preventing a landlord from entering the property only for specific circumstances, or with the tenant\u2019s permission.\n\nThe Right to Peace and Quiet: Numerous tenants of rental properties often have complaints of a neighbor playing music too loud, or a landlord that constantly interrupts the use of the property. Under the covenant of quiet enjoyment, landlords must attempt to resolve issues of noise complaints between neighboring tenants, or other nuisances, so that a tenant may have peace and quiet.\n\nThe Right to Freedom from Discrimination: A tenant has the right to use the property however they like, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate the specified terms of the rental contract, or create a nuisance to other tenants. This means that the landlord cannot refuse to lease a premises based on a potential tenant\u2019s gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected classes. Additionally, once a tenant is leasing the property, a landlord cannot prevent them from using the land however they\u2019d like.\n\nThe Right to Safety and Security: The property must be reasonably safe for the tenant. This means that the tenant\u2019s use of the property should be free from threats from the landlord, other tenants, or hazards. Thus, failing to disclose a hazard, or failing to fix a hazard, may be considered a violation of the covenant of quiet enjoyment; and\n\nThe Right to Basic Utilities: Basic utilities, which include water, electricity, heat, and internet in some cases, are all protected under the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Therefore, if basic utilities are not provided, then the tenant may be able to break their lease and sue the landlord for the costs of relocation.\n\nAlso search your lease for any exceptions to these laws and ruling.  In some locations such as Arizona.  The courts don't give a flying \ud83d\udc00\ud83c\udf51 what the lease says if it violates tenant rights.  For those who say it's a legal contact.  The state of Arizona has made it a class 6 felony and minimum sentence of 12 months forfeiture of rents for a landlord to require a tenant to waive rights granted to them by state law.  So again.

But I'm not in an apartment or a roommate situation so I don't know if you'd technically be TA for expecting him to live up to his own rules. In my eyes, you're NTA though.", "NTA - This man is an asshat.\n\nHe expects a situation where your money is going to his mortgage/pockets just because he has the luxury of owning a home. On top of that, he gets to enjoy it and impose on your peace while you have strict rules to follow.", "NAH. As the owner of the home (or primary tenant) he can set different rules for you than he does for himself. \n\nBUT, you can certainly state your grievances and negotiate! It's in his best interest to have a happy tenant. So, explain to him what needs to happen for you to continue to be both happy, and a tenant in his home. \n\nTo strengthen your bargaining position, you should have a plan in place in case you can't negotiate an agreement. \n\nBut *don't* play the \"this isn't fair\" game! That will get you nowhere. Remember that he has something you want (a place to live,) and that you have something he wants (rent money). You are two adults negotiating how to get what you want.", "It's his house. The rules don't apply to him.  However its rude of him. \n\nNTA find a new place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
