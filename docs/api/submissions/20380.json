I would also talk to your parents so maybe your dad can talk to him, too. Parents shouldn't only talk to their children about sex. They should also talk to them about what a healthy relationship looks like. Good luck!", "Going against the grain here, YTA for laughing at him instead of being a decent adult and brother. This was perfect opportunity to have a discussion with your brother about alpha male bs (also pointing out that a men's height shouldn't be an issue at all, any woman ragging on that needs to quit), maybe find out why he has these feelings. Has something triggered him to sway towards this way of thinking? He's young and if this alpha male bs is something he feels validates him then find out the underlining issue.\n\nAlso perfect opportunity with 2 woman there to sit and help answer certain questions or give him a woman's view point.\n\nYou aren't a horrible person and obviously young still yourself but laughing at him won't change his view.", "NTA but your brother is being radicalized by a very specific form of online content that ultimately connects to incels. I don\u2019t know if he has other positive male influences in his life but definitely try to be one and to just challenge some of these ideas before they get even darker.", "YTA. Yeah, mocking people's interests is an asshole move. Honestly, you really need to treat him with kindness. If you one-up him and try to beat him down, he's just going to think he's right and cling harder to this belief structure he's found on the internet. He's listening to them because they make sense to him. You have to show him kindness so he knows there's another way to interact with the world.

He showed you something you didn't like (rightly so), so you mocked him for it (rather than attacking the content of the vid).\n\nAnd the more you mock him, the less he'll hear you when you have a conversation about what it is to be a man, not this bullshit 'alpha male' parody of masculinity that's being sold to him. And you really should. Good luck!", "NTA but you need to approach the situation differently. Talk to your brother about toxic masculinity rather than mocking him", "NTA. Calling out that shit is the best way to stop it from spreading. You should really be concerned about where your brother is heading, though.", "You're not wrong, but YTA.\n\nYour brother is headed down a really dangerous path, and mocking him and making fun of him is the WORST way to get him off of it. You're his older brother, and this may just seem like silly bullshit to you, but he really believes it, and he's at a very vulnerable, impressionable age, where he's just starting to form his world view but it can still change. \n\nI'm not sure what your goal was with mocking him, or if you even had a goal . . . most likely you weren't thinking much about it at all. But the thing is, you NEED to stop and think about the consequences of how you interact with him right now. Because he's taking it seriously. When you shame him for things that he feels strongly about, you REINFORCE his beliefs that you (and people like you) are the enemy who \"don't understand him\" and whatever challenges he's going through as a teenager . . . and that these absolute shitwits he's following, who are encouraging him, building him up, and filling his mind with dangerous nonsense are the only ones who do \"understand him\". And the more you shame and laugh at him, the more he's going to shut your voice (and rational thought) out and follow these very dangerous voices. And make no mistake, they are dangerous. This is not just silliness. These men who are telling him to \"be an alpha\" are also teaching him that women like to be slapped and choked during sex, and that it is his right to treat women like belongings. They're teaching him that morality and ethics are for chumps. And they're teaching him so much worse. \n\nSo yeah, even if you thought you were just joking around, YTA, though you're not wrong. You need to take this seriously. You need to talk to your parents, and you need to sit down with your brother and have a heart-to-heart. Because mocking him is just going to drive him further into this hornet's nest.", "Huge YTA. Your brother is 15 and tries to have a place in the world. The thought he chooses is obviously pathetic and will cause him and people around him tons of suffering. As a brother you must help him to take a better path. Ridiculing thoughts is a good way to show people that they are wrong. One of my friends used to think basketball must be banned because it is not a fair game, tall people have unfair advantage. After months of trying to convince him, we used his thought in other areas and ridiculed, he understood afterwards. But mocking is NEVER a good way of convincing people. Your brother probably has some inferiority complex, and to feel better takes refuge in his nonsense thoughts. By mocking him you feed his inferiority and make things worse. Maybe having such an insensitive big brother is one of the reasons for his problems. Grow up and help your brother.", "YTA - You shouldn't be making fun of him but guiding him. He clearly is trying to find his way and feels like he isn't masculine enough, older brothers can really be influential and you just made fun of him", "If your brother needs an actual alpha male gym tiktoker, then he needs Noel Deyzel.

This terminology was first used in 1947 by Rudolf Schenkel of the University of Basel, who based his findings on researching the behavior of captive gray wolves.\\[20\\] This view on gray wolf pack dynamics was later popularized by the researcher L. David Mech in his 1970 book The Wolf. He later found additional evidence that the concept of an Alpha male may have been an interpretation of incomplete data and formally disavowed this terminology in 1999. He explained that it was heavily based on the behavior of captive packs consisting of unrelated individuals, an error reflecting the once prevailing view that wild pack formation occurred in winter among independent gray wolves. Later research on wild gray wolves revealed that the pack is usually a family consisting of a breeding pair and their offspring of the previous 1\u20133 years. In the article, Mech wrote that the use of the term \"alpha\" to describe the breeding pair adds no additional information, and is \"no more appropriate than referring to a human parent or a doe deer as an alpha.\" He further notes the terminology falsely implies a \"force-based dominance hierarchy.\" In 13 years of summer observations of wild wolves, he witnessed no dominance contests between them.\\[21\\]  \nIn some other wild canids, the alpha male may not have exclusive access to the alpha female.\\[22\\] Other pack members as in the African painted dog (Lycaon pictus) may guard the maternity den used by the alpha female.\\[23\\]", "Having an open dialog like you said, rerouting those negative thoughts, and like others said therapy and time is the best thing for this kid.
