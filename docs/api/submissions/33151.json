Yeah, take it with you.", "I went through a similar situation except I paid for most of it. When we split (she cheated) I we were going through the apartment and separating things. She had bought me something as a \u201cgift\u201d and said I couldn\u2019t have it because she \u201cpaid for it\u201d so I went scorched earth. If I paid for it I took it. And I mean everything.

I knew she hated clutter at her home, very type A OCD, so she would take it out to her barn on her farm land, and it would all be ruined if he didn't come and get it quickly. \nI had told him that if he just quickly signed the divorce papers and claimed all the debt he left me with when he skipped town, I would store it for him in my spare room. He didn't. He just ignored the papers and me... so I gave it to her in the beginning of hurricane season so the moisture and humidity would be the worst in her non-climate controlled leaky barn.", "YWBTA if you take things that are mounted.

I don't think he really needs or cares about the useless crap. Speaking from personal experience, decorations, rugs, custom made coat racks, etc. are not something to be missed, and when I split with my ex, I wish she would have taken more of her crap from my house so that I did not have to deal with getting rid of it.

I\u2019m a project manager so I put in new flooring, painted everything, new cabinets in some places, painted and molded all the doors.
