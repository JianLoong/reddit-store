I remember as a kid being scared by certain houses and guess what I did...I skipped them. I would place a big bet this kid did not want to go to your door and their parents coaxed them into it. The kid isn't traumatized, and I garauntee trick or treat continued after this. \n\nWe go all out for Halloween. Our yard is fully decorated, and it isn't your cheesy charlie brown blow up figures. We have animatronics that react to motion and all that. We see a ton of kids from all ages and like being the scary house on the street. I don't even get to see the costumes because my wife hands out the candy. I am in another room holding the remote to our fog machine. After everyone gets their candy I randomly activate the fog machine. That gets more response than the evil clowns or any of that stuff. Multiple young kids got spooked and ran away laughing. My wife always at the door sweetly saying don't worry it's just fog. Only 1 little kid cried and guess who was laughing, the dad, as he explained to them don't worry it's just decorations. \n\nNobody is the asshole in this situation. If you wanted to argue someone is, then it's the parents that let them approach an obviously placed jump scare.  People are so ridiculous sometimes. Don't want your kid scared? Don't take them to the obviously scary houses. It isn't hard.  To those saying halloween is for the kids, yeah it is.

Perhaps your wife suggesting 'hey, if you can tell that the kid is sensitive, just sit there or lift the mask for them' would be reasonable.\n\nMaybe the parents wanted a bit of scare on, you know, Halloween, so they could then talk to their kid about the experience. \n\nOne of my older sons did something similar a few years back.
