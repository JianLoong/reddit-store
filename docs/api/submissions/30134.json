The kid isn't traumatized, and I garauntee trick or treat continued after this. \n\nWe go all out for Halloween. Our yard is fully decorated, and it isn't your cheesy charlie brown blow up figures. We have animations that react to motion and all that. We see a ton of kids from all ages and like being the scary house on the street. I don't even get to see the costumes because my wife hands out the candy. I am in another room holding the remote to our fog machine. After everyone gets their candy I randomly activate the fog machine. That gets more response than the evil clowns or any of that stuff. Multiple young kids got spooked and ran away laughing. My wife always at the door sweetly saying don't worry it's just fog. Only 1 little kid cried and guess who was laughing, the dad, as he explained to them don't worry it's just decorations. \n\nNobody is the asshole in this situation. If you wanted to argue someone is, then it's the parents that let them approach an obviously placed jump scare.  People are so ridiculous sometimes. Don't want your kid scared? Don't take them to the obviously scary houses. It isn't hard.  To those saying halloween is for the kids, yeah it is.

Perhaps your wife suggesting 'hey, if you can tell that the kid is sensitive, just sit there or lift the mask for them' would be reasonable.\n\nMaybe the parents wanted a bit of scare on, you know, Halloween, so they could then talk to their kid about the experience. \n\nOne of my older sons did something similar a few years back.

That sounds really sweet.", "Maybe a US/UK culturally difference but if my kid would be traumatised by seeing a scary costume I wouldn't take them trick or treating", "When I was a kid and people put up things that would pop up and scare me, or would try to scare me on their porch/in their yard, it always felt like I was being forced by my friends or family to deal with stuff I didn\u2019t want to just for the bribe of candy. Idk, something just felt gross about it and I hated it as a kid.", "They may be laughing at off to show their kid that he doesn't need to be worried. I saw lots of parents doing this last night, pointing out how \"silly\" some of the scarier stuff was to their kids to make them feel better.", "That kid is gonna develop a mental illness and corresponding drug habit because of OP's Jason costume. Every waking moment will be torment and every sleepless night will be worse than hell. His life is effectively over already. That family will be torn apart.\n\nI really wish people could just say YTA on here without making everything sound like the end of the world.", "Awkwardly, they have been one of my favorite horror movies starting when I was six. My parents hated it, but my best friend\u2019s Mom loved to watch horror movies and we\u2019d hide in the kitchen to watch them.", "This is part of why there's no trick or treats where I live. The school and some churches will do events, but there were always a bunch of complaints about people going overboard. One kid ever up so scared he ran into the street and was hit by a car. From what I heard he was mostly ok but it was decided that the whole situation was too dangerous because several had almost been hit in the past. (We only have sidewalks on a couple main streets, and the businesses pay to maintain them. Everywhere else if you get off the yard you're in the street)\n\nAnd people who insist on it go into a neighboring town. My family stopped going to houses when I was going because one of my sisters was always scared. So we went to businesses. The liquor store was always the best because they'd get a big bag of candy and then only a few kids would show up, so they'd give each of us a ton! And while at since if the other stores we'd find out from other kids or parents who was giving out the big candy bars and wouldn't try to trick anyone. Then we'd go home early and watch movies while eating the candy. We tended to have more loot than the other kids because of going to the stores.", "Ok, so what? This kid doesn't know who jason is anyway, it's just a guy in a hockey mask, except he also doesn't know it's a hockey mask because they don't look like that anymore. Halloween is about the frights.", "Found your one comment to reply to didn\u2019t ya.  YTA", "YTA", "Kids below a certain age range don\u2019t have the same comprehension of things intended for adults or older kids. My sister saw LOTR too young and didn\u2019t get most of what was going on but a couple of years later rewatching it became petrified of Gollum for months after. \n\nToddlers just saw a guy with a different looking face. You knew he was scared already and decided it would be funny to terrify him. YTA", "Yeah I don\u2019t know what people are mad about. How dare he get scared on Halloween lol", "Why would you not put that in the original post when that\u2019s kind of a significant detail. It just ends up coming off like it might not be true. \n\nDid you stop and talk to him before or after he immediately ran away in tears? Because you didn\u2019t leave an opening in your story for it to happen either way.", "I'm pretty happy with our talking Jack Skellington door knocker.  It has a motion sensor and says stuff like \"all of you look adorable! What a great costume!\" It seems cartoony and friendly enough that none of the little kids have been scared so far, but when it starts moving some of the teens have been satisfyingly startled, lol", "Thank you.   :)", "Yeah this. One of my kids hates scary stuff. So we happily agreed that he didn\u2019t want to go trick or treating; he\u2019s just not fussed about it. Youngest (who will face off with any monster) decided to bring back loot to share. Everybody happy.", "Agreed. I don't get the poster who said \"don't scare unless they give you permission to\" lol. Who the hell is going to be scared if you give them permission to go ahead and scare them. Halloween didn't use to be the cutesy little funfest - the object of Halloween was to get a good scare in on someone and laugh about it later. If you got scared you too laughed about it later, ate some more candy, and then went on about your night.\n If you were so fragile to the point you couldn't handle it then you need to stay the f*** home. Being jump scared by someone in a costume who suddenly moves is not some uber terrifying trauma you'll carry with you for life lol get flipping real.", "Aita. Soft ass folks raising soft ass kids. Scary houses where the best and unfortunately few and far between.", "True, that can be a good tactic with kids: they look to adults for cues and reassurance.", "God thank you. People act like a small child being frightened and crying on Halloween is grounds for Vietnam veteran levels of PTSD.", "I would get excited when \"The Chucky Movie\" was on. That was what I thought it was called when I was 5/6 years old. That one and Crybaby were my two favorite movies for a while. I also loved Maximum Overdrive.", "Who downvoted this? This is awesome. People are so soft now its ridiculous", "Haha, I agree though. All I was saying was that these days I'd probably find a large man in a hockey mask that most kids don't see any more is probably a tiny bit more scary than a silly looking worlfman or scarecrow costume. Maybe that's just me though. I still think op is NTA.", "The kid was at least 10-12 so that is a poor argument.  Did you read the whole thing ot just jump on the YTA bandwagon?  Or are you implying that it's OK to rry and scare toddlers cause they can't \"comprehend scary things\"?", "Oh, that sounds lovely.   Perfect mix", "I\u2019m 27 and hate scary stuff. This would terrify me Nevermind my kid. Tbh though in our area it\u2019s not a thing so we won\u2019t be going trick or treating when he\u2019s older", "Not true. Kids got scared back in the day, too. Just because you and your circle didn't doesn't mean that others weren't.", "I remember being jump scared from someone dressed up as a swamp monster who blended in with the ivy on their concrete wall. I laughed about it after leaving that house. Too many helicopter parents now have ruined so much of the fun.", "I absolutely still love Bride of Chucky too. It makes me laugh so hard how snarky she is and how she keeps Chucky in check. She\u2019s the real queen.", "I naturally loved Chucky\u2026 I dunno why but I find him funny on occasion, but my real love is for Chucky\u2019s Bride. She\u2019s top tier hilarious. Just her snark alone makes me roll.", "My sisters and I had someone who looked like a witch decoration holding a candy bowl, she grabbed the hand of the last person to get candy. We all jumped, I started laughing when I realized I was ok, the middle one started crying because she was scared, and the youngest was confused. (We were 4, 6, and 8)"]}
