We have been married for 6 years. My MIL has always been the type to tell everyone her business and seems to search for validation from any and everyone. \n\nBackground: My husband and I have a 5 bdrm house. It's old. The landlord is equally as old.. we have no central heat and air, leaving us with gas heat and stove, as well as, window units. Over the winter our gas had a leak and our landlord would never fix it. We had to move our youngest and ourselves into the living room since we did not have a wall heater in ours and the room was freezing. \n\nWe also have a stopped sink that requires the cast iron pipes to be replaced, a water heater that is at least 40 years old and breaks constantly, leaving us with no hot water on multiple occasions. The front door was kicked in when we were broken into leaving only a glass door that does not lock. The landlord will not fix any of it..\n\nMy 9 yo son told his teacher all of these things and she called CPS. They did not take our children, but we decided that they should be at my MILs while we fixed everything (about 3 weeks). \n\nDuring that time my MIL made FB posts and told everyone at her work that she had \"custody\" of my children. She blocked me from seeing these posts and I only recently viewed them. She is making it seem like she is the savior and I while she doesn't go in detail, she leaves enough out to where no one knows the circumstances. Plus flat out lying about custody. \n\nSince finding out she publicly said these things I have told her she will not be seeing my children. I didn't say it to be vindictive, but I am a VERY private person. She knows this. I can not let my mental health be effected by her need to have admiration from everyone. Plus some of these people have kids that know my oldest daughter and having everyone think this is really embarrassing for her.  I have no family and hate that it is this way, but I am very big on making sure I keep boundaries up. \n\nShe is super upset and of course she \"did nothing wrong\". She has never been the type to ask for the kids to come over, my youngest had never been with her unless we were visiting her and she lives down the road.  It's not like she is involved in their life. Am I wrong?\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: My husband is not the father to my oldest 2 children. Also, we were in the process of fixing the issues prior to all of this.", "created_utc": 1690570764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15c5zkn/aita_for_telling_my_mil_that_she_wont_be_seeing/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Here\u2019s the problem. You had unsafe living conditions. I also have a sneaking suspicion that CPA STRONGLY encouraged you to get the house in living condition or move so your kids could come back.

I have a feeling she\u2019s not quite the villain you say", "Yes! Check your local laws. By me you can put rent into an escrow account with the district court rather than to the landlord until repairs are made. Very effective! You should NOT be paying for those repairs.", "Heck, I'd even be concerned if the 9 year old is...", "No. I definitely should have clarified my oldest two are not his biologically.", "No sorry should have clarified. My 13 yo and 9 yo are from a prev marriage but grew up with their father not being around etc.", "Hoping for adoption/fostering to be the answer here. Otherwise the numbers are *yikes*", "Was wondering the same", "My oldest 2 are from a previous marriage and their biological father is not in the picture. (His own choice). My husband is their father.", "No. He is not the biological father to my oldest two children, but he is the only one they consider their dad. I edited to add as we don't decipher in our house so I honestly didn't think about it lol \n\nI see now how that would be problematic", "No. The landlord did. Should she have been more proactive? Absolutely! But I can attest with older kids, a toddler and a new born, holy crap is it difficult to even cook one meal or do laundry. \n\nThe MIL is absolutely crazy and the fact she blocked her from seeing the posts show she is narcissistic and hero complex. Do NOT leave your kids with her anymore and now get the landlord to do their damn job. NTA mama!", "I agree with you.  CPS came and the kids had to go somewhere so MIL had temp 'custody.'", "I added the edit at the end lol oldest 2 are not his biologically, but very much so the dad.", "I thought that too, but the two older kids are probably from another man.", "Only the youngest 2 are from my husband. My oldest were from a previous marriage, and their father is no longer in the picture (his wishes). \nI should have clarified, but we had contacted a plumber about the gas and water heater and bought the front door (we ordered the wrong size), but at the time this occurred we were in the middle of a pretty bad winter storm and no one could make it out. \n\nWe don't have a plethora of money and even fixing everything ourselves our landlord will not deduct from rent.

Updating my judgment to NTA, MIL is just toxic.", "Don\u2019t act like you willingly made the repairs. They break constantly isn\u2019t in a matter of weeks. The ONLY reason you fixed them when you did was\u2026CPS said you had to.", "If they rent the house, it's on the landlord to make repairs, not on them. They will now have to sue the landlord probably for reimbursement for something that he should have fixed. That is supposed to be included in rent and many renting families don't have budgets for home repairs because they are not supposed to be responsible for them!\n\nA lot of people have to fight bad landlords to get repairs, etc. That doesn't make them bad or irresponsible parents in the least.", "CPS wouldn\u2019t have been an issue if the landlord had made the repairs that are on him to make.", "100% the case. My landlord is in his late 80s. He owns a furniture store and when I went in to pay rent 2 months ago he literally thought I was someone paying on their furniture and told me he isn't my landlord. I had to reach out to his family to let them know what was going on. Trust me, no one willingly goes without heat in the winter lol. We are moving into our new house in 3 weeks when they get done with some issues thankfully, but I'll never get my money back for all of the repairs.", "It depends on where you live and the contract. The landlord may not be responsible for repairs. More importantly if you know the place has issues and the landlord refuses to fix them\u2026it\u2019s on you to either move or sue the landlord for the repairs.", "Take him, or his estate should he pass, to small claims court. Keep all of the receipts for what you paid for (materials, labor, whatever) and absolutely go after that money. It may take a while but probably worth it!", "Not everyone can afford to sue and moving takes money that needs to be saved. From the comments OP has made, the landlord is supposed to be responsible for it. Sounds like the man has dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s and his family should be taking over all of his businesses.", "Going to try to look into it over the weekend!"]}
