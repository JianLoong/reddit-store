You shouldn't have gone in his phone and deleted them, plus doubling down by calling him a pervert", "I feel like I\u2019m taking crazy pills here with the contradictory responses. OP is NTA. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1) She doesn\u2019t want pictures taken of her. She explicitly stated it to her ex. He has no right to do so. Will she regret it in the future? She might, but that\u2019s not her exes call to make. OP made her choice. Ex can literally take pictures of his baby without the unwilling party involved. \n\n2) Is breastfeeding sexual? No. But OP still gets to decide when pictures of her are taken! It\u2019s gross to ignore her lack of consent. Breastfeeding can also be extremely stressful, and Ex is just making it more so. \n\n3) She gave birth two months ago. She doesn\u2019t like the pictures. Why can\u2019t he leave her alone? What is his problem? Why does he need pictures of her? \n\nEveryone here is so quick to say that OP had no right to go through his phone bc privacy and that she didn\u2019t have his permission. What about her privacy being violated? He does not need to have pictures of her that she doesn\u2019t want to be taken. He has absolutely no right to do that without her permission. Under these circumstances, she has every right to delete the pictures! She didn\u2019t snoop on his phone, she just deleted pictures of HERSELF that she didn\u2019t consent to being taken.

I have no idea what is up with this sub today, but it's super disappointing.", "NTA - You told him you didn't want your picture taken and he refused to respect that.  I don't care what he says about not posting--that's the same thing said by every AH who ever revenge-p0rn'd someone.

No, but you wouldn't have done it if he respected your boundaries", "Normally I wouldn't condone going through someone's phone without their consent but nta because you openly communicated your discomfort with photos (regardless of bf) and he violated it, he wasn't going to delete them.

You don't like photos of you NOW, but in three or five or ten years he's right, you probably are going to regret not having them.\n\nMy Ex took my son when he was a baby and disappeared. I have no more than 10 actual photos of my son when he was a baby, and not one single photo of me holding him, or him sleeping on my chest. Or holding my finger like he did. Or me feeding him or anything else. Not one. And that kills me every day. \n\nYou don't have to keep all of them but keep some of them. The candid photos are the most important. They aren't fake. They're real. They are actual life and actual memories, not posed to create a curated impression.", "I would say YTA but he was taking unwanted photos of your breastfeeding.

Any other issues raise separately", "*EDIT: Changing to NTA after being informed with more info*\n\nNTA - I get your feelings and concerns as they are valid but I do think that should've been a conversation to be had. More than likely, he just wants as many pictures of his child to remember these moments while he can and unfortunately, you'd be in majority of those whether he wanted you in them or not.

So NTA from my point of view.", "My vote is YTA but not even for going through his phone (which is messed up in itself) but dude seems like he's legitimately just trying to preserve these moments.  You didn't say one thing that would even remotely indicate that he's doing anything inappropriate with the pictures so you calling him a pervert was excessive, dramatic and uncalled for.\n\nAnd yes, from one parent to another the reality is that you would most likely appreciate these pictures later down the road.", "Normally, its a YTA move to go through someone's phone unattended without permission.\n\nHowever, i would say you are NTA here because ex does not have permission to be taking pictures of you after you already said no, especially breastfeeding pictures which is just fucking weird and definitely not ok. He can take a picture of his kid without you in it if he cares so much, and if i had a nickel for every \"i promise i won't show these pictures to anyone else\" that didn't keep their word, i could be retired on some tropical island now.\n\nLet this hopefully be a lesson for both to respect boundaries, though if you both still struggle to respect boundaries i would follow through on that threat to move out.", "Eh, he\u2019s kinda got a point.

Like everyone keeps saying everyone has their own experience so I am expressing mine, maybe misworded but it\u2019s more of her to hopefully get some family or friends to be sure there are pics with the baby if she wants them. Consent is a huge thing I actually teach it to youth to the point of working with law enforcement to show them the importance of consent.", "I mean she\u2019s told him no. He keeps dismissing her. Sounds like she\u2019s given him reasons why and had tried the civil way. If he\u2019s going to ignore her consent for picture taken I don\u2019t know why she should respect his \u201cconsent\u201d to delete those pictures.", "The first course of action was telling him not to take the pictures. If theres any tension, the root cause is him not respecting her", "Only because people are commenting that her breasts are showing and that\u2019s why they think it\u2019s problematic.", "Agreed!  Same concept as if your picture is taken in the background in public.  If you don't want to appear in that picture,  you can demand that it's taken down and they have to respect it.", "Yeah I can agree to that\n\nI do think that the actions themselves were perverted. His INTENT may not have been, but the results certainly were", "While she is in the pictures and she has said no, then her decision needs to be respected.", "They really don't. The other parent can have pictures of themselves with the child, or pictures of the child only, or pictures of the child with people who consent to their picture being taken. They are not entitled to pictures of people that didn't give their consent to have that picture taken.", "Yeah, I am not disagreeing with your statements. If she clearly told him to not take the photos and he still did it, he is the one causing the tension to begin with. Then OP has a choice to approach it in a way that can diffuse some of that tension, or the fastest route to get what she wants but will inevitably add to the tension.\n\nThey share a newborn and a home together, it\u2019s important they talk out their differences including the issue of photos. If everybody just keeps doing stuff to each other without consent, nothing is going to be better.", "Taking pics of someone\u2019s covered breasts at the gym without their knowledge and consent is also perverted. Your comment is irrelevant", "Or maybe it\u2019s because were parents who didn\u2019t take pictures of ourselves with our babies because we were still adjusting to the massive changes in our bodies and raging hormones and now we literally cherish the few that we have and you non child having people just don\u2019t have the understanding of that because you don\u2019t have the experience.\n\nBefore I get eaten alive on here, I want to clarify I disagree with the fact that he took breastfeeding pics, but the fully clothed regular pics are not a big deal. You ever knock on someones door with a ring door bell or walk into a grocery store? Those people have pictures of you too and you cant just go in and delete them. \n\nI also think its important to point out to you people that do not have children for the first 6 months especially if you are exclusively breastfeeding, that child is pretty much glued to your arms. The amount of opportunities he would have to take pictures if they cant have mom in them anywhere is significantly reduced.", "I disagree. If it was she didn't  want pictures  of  just her that's one thing. But breast  feeding a new born is a constant  job and a parent  has a right to capture  moments  Llike baby's first feed. Her being in pictures of that is unavoidable.  I could even understand  if she didn't want her face in pictures. But to flat out deny  a parent  from  taking pictures  of their own child feeding is an over step.", "This!!! I don\u2019t get what\u2019s so hard about this for people to grasp. It\u2019s her body! If she says no photos then no photos should be taken.", "You can't have it both ways", "I guess everyone is different, but for me and my babies the pain and frustration was over at about six weeks. Those were a LONG six weeks, though.", "Her rights over her body and the images captured of it are paramount to his insistence to take those pictures. \n\nThere are so many first moments that he could capture, including his own first time feeding the baby later on, that don\u2019t make the mother (who is already in a vulnerable state being newly postpartum) uncomfortable existing in or undertaking necessary tasks (like feeding the baby) in her own home. \n\nIf she didn\u2019t live with him would you still think that her ex has the right to come over and photograph her with a baby at her exposed breasts?", "It's not at all. OP should move and take the baby with them. The ex can take pictures when he has visitation or custody time with the child. It sounds like he's completely useless if he's just taking pictures of OP caring for the child instead of actually caring for the child.", "Taking pictures of a woman\u2019s exposed breasts without their consent and knowledge IS perverted and creepy and violating and I am GENUINELY disturbed that so many people seem to be confused about that.", "Lucky! My girl is 5 months and she still fusses. She\u2019s gonna be a picky eater.", "I did still agree that it was wrong - hence the statement that it\u2019s *thoughtless and invasive* to take a picture of it without permission. That\u2019s absolutely the number one issue.\n\nCalling someone a pervert for doing something that likely has zero sexual connotations or desire for them, however, does have repercussions. Much more serious ones, in many cases (as unfortunate as that is). If you\u2019re going to call someone out on what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s important to be accurate on what you\u2019re accusing them of.", "Taking someone\u2019s picture without permission is creepy and violating. Period. That\u2019s the be all end all. It\u2019s violation of her body autonomy- he doesn\u2019t have a right to her body.\n\nBreastfeeding isn\u2019t inherently sexual, and unless there is evidence that the Ex gets off on that shit, isn\u2019t what she should be accusing him of.", "Creepy and violating yes, perverted no. A pervert is someone whose *sexual behavior* is considered wrong or abnormal. There are very few non-sexual reasons why you might want pictures of someone's breasts without their consent, but wanting pictures of your child feeding is one of them. That **does not mean it's okay** to take them, but if it's not sexual then the person isn't a pervert, just an asshole.", "Lol, oh no. That sounds frustrating!", "It IS perverted to insist on taking pictures of someone\u2019s breasts against their will.\n\nIt is perverted to hear someone say \u201cI feel violated and uncomfortable with you having these pictures\u201d and respond with \u201cnah, and I\u2019m gonna take more\u201d\n\nIt is perverted to believe consent is a suggestion.\n\nIf someone took pics of you going to the bathroom you wouldn\u2019t object to someone calling them a pervert just because there wasn\u2019t evidence they had gotten off to the pictures hey take of women in the bathroom \n\nYou\u2019d just call them a pervert, because sneaking pics of exposed women IS INHERENTLY PERVERTED regardless of whether you jack off to them"]}
