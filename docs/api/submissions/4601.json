She might, but that\u2019s not her exes call to make. OP made her choice. Ex can literally take pictures of his baby without the unwilling party involved. \n\n2) Is breastfeeding sexual? No. But OP still gets to decide when pictures of her are taken! It\u2019s gross to ignore her lack of consent. Breastfeeding can also be extremely stressful, and Ex is just making it more so. \n\n3) She gave birth two months ago. She doesn\u2019t like the pictures. Why can\u2019t he leave her alone? What is his problem? Why does he need pictures of her? \n\nEveryone here is so quick to say that OP had no right to go through his phone bc privacy and that she didn\u2019t have his permission. What about her privacy being violated? He does not need to have pictures of her that she doesn\u2019t want to be taken. He has absolutely no right to do that without her permission. Under these circumstances, she has every right to delete the pictures! She didn\u2019t snoop on his phone, she just deleted pictures of HERSELF that she didn\u2019t consent to being taken.

You don't like photos of you NOW, but in three or five or ten years he's right, you probably are going to regret not having them.\n\nMy Ex took my son when he was a baby and disappeared. I have no more than 10 actual photos of my son when he was a baby, and not one single photo of me holding him, or him sleeping on my chest. Or holding my finger like he did. Or me feeding him or anything else. Not one. And that kills me every day. \n\nYou don't have to keep all of them but keep some of them. The candid photos are the most important. They aren't fake.

You didn't say one thing that would even remotely indicate that he's doing anything inappropriate with the pictures so you calling him a pervert was excessive, dramatic and uncalled for.\n\nAnd yes, from one parent to another the reality is that you would most likely appreciate these pictures later down the road.", "Normally, its a YTA move to go through someone's phone unattended without permission.\n\nHowever, i would say you are NTA here because ex does not have permission to be taking pictures of you after you already said no, especially breastfeeding pictures which is just fucking weird and definitely not ok. He can take a picture of his kid without you in it if he cares so much, and if i had a nickel for every \"i promise i won't show these pictures to anyone else\" that didn't keep their word, i could be retired on some tropical island now.\n\nLet this hopefully be a lesson for both to respect boundaries, though if you both still struggle to respect boundaries i would follow through on that threat to move out.", "Eh, he\u2019s kinda got a point.

Her ex is taking semi-nude photos of her against her will, and you think the problem here is her calling him a pervert. Jesus.", "He's a pervert because he's taking photos of her that show more of her body than she wants him to have. You're implying that the reason it would be inappropriate for him to have those pictures is that he's masturbating to them...What if she just doesn't like him having photos of her where part of her breast is visible? Why do his memories of the \"early days\" have to involve her breastfeeding? Also maybe she called him a pervert because he took photos of her doing something without her consent, that he knew would make her uncomfortable..That is a seriously messed up thing to do. \n\n\"She doesn't want to look back at pictures of herself looking like new moms look\". So?! It doesn't matter what people's own individual experiences turned out like and the things they regret...She has EVERY RIGHT to refuse the pictures being taken and to then delete them when her ex violated her boundaries.", "I was talking purely morally. \nImo this kinds of laws are a joke, but I recognize they exist in certain places.", "He can still take photos of their son, but there is no reason she should be in them.", "The big problem is that OP is living with a person who ignored her boundaries and took photos of her semi-nude against her explicit wishes. That's red flags for danger and abuse. Consent matters and I think you need to reflect on your response.", "I'd immediately have anyone who took naked photos of me against my will charged. \n\nI understand this is clearly a hot button issue for you, but the Redditors on this sub are a big part of the problem in refusing to understand consent. You yourself have completely glossed over an issue that is really akin to assault, in favour of worrying about the phone. That's important for you to reflect on, because it clearly implies to you think it's not important or worth considering and discussing. So do many other Redditors, apparently, and it's no surprise we live in a world where rape and assault is so common. This lack of consent is directly linked. \n\nIgnoring that, the second issue would not have occurred, had he not instigated the first issue. It's a direct result of his own actions. \n\nAnd given he could take photos of the baby alone, and himself with the baby, I wonder why he chose to violate her privacy when OP was vulnerable?", "So just to be clear - you appear to be arguing that a complete stranger doesn't have a right to privacy - and she waves her bodily autonomy- and it's fine for people to take naked photos of her against her will - because you personally think she might possibly regret it one day in the future?   \nYou need to read up on consent because you're coming across in an absolutely terrifying way.", "Why would he listen a second time when he didn't listen the first time?  I can't roll my eyes hard enough.", "And yet you implied, and continue to imply, through use of ESH and your lack of qualification (and your continued lack of qualification or clarification) that they are equal.", "Also to play devils advocate...\n\nThere are people who fetishize breastfeeding, and sometimes pictures end up on public forums...", "It's so depressing reading these comments - especially given most seem to be parents and are likely passing these toxic ideas down...", "I think two things can both be problematic. Calling your partner a pervert *is a problem.* Either they are, and you have a major problem on your hands, or they aren't and it causes significant harm to the relationship, but either way there is a problem there aside from his violation of her boundaries, which is *also* a major problem.", "Legally you can\u2019t but once again this sub is focusing on the wrong thing. We are not here for legal advice. You would not be an asshole to take your laptop back regardless of if it\u2019s not okay legally. It\u2019s your laptop and so long as you don\u2019t break shit for fun you\u2019re not an asshole for getting it back. She is not an asshole for deleting the photos he had no right or consent to take in the first place. This is such a dumb straw man that multiple people are piling on, you\u2019re right.", "You are arguing alone mate, don't think you are so important in my life \ud83d\ude09 I just answered a question online and you involved yourself in it like I insulted you. \n\nI didn't saw I didn't finished my comment, I agree that the breastfeeding ones can be erased, I wouldn't feel fine if my ex had pictures like this of myself. That's why I asked first if all the pictures were during BF. \nBut for the non breastfeeding one ... I don't care. She can do anything she wants, I just know it's true a lot of parents regret it and that about this argument her ex has a point, and that she's erasing her kids' memory. And that if she wants to have good relation with him later in life (no matter if she's right or wrong) they need to really improve their communication. \n\nOh, and don't be rude honey \ud83d\ude09 You don't know me, I don't know you, so grow up a bit and don't imagine something only to give some spice to your life. I'm just giving my opinion on a subject, it doesn't mean anything else than my opinion on this subject.", "Are you genuinely asking without realizing", "I don\u2019t think she\u2019s sexualising breastfeeding in general, but I think anyone non-consensually photographing a person breastfeeding is behaving like a pervert.", "In that scenario, I would call the ex a pervert too\n\nTaking pictures of exposed breasts without the woman\u2019s consent, berating her for protecting her right to privacy etc \n\nThe fact that she\u2019s breastfeeding isn\u2019t the part that makes him a pervert\n\nHis non consensual pictures of exposed women taken without their knowledge or consent is what makes him a complete pervert", "He\u2019s an ex-partner, not a current partner, so I think the question of \u201charm to the relationship\u201d is moot. And I think the fact that her ex-partner is taking partially clothed pictures of her against her will *is* perverted.", "Yeah, him violating her privacy and safety while she's vulnerable, when she's explicitly asked him to stop? That's the problem. And I do think it's perverted. She could probably have him charged. You are saying these things like they are equal in severity: they are not.", "Actually, I don't give a shit. Sorry about your friend.", "Thank you. \nI didn't want to state the obvious.", "No, I'm implying your comments and judgement are ignorant and poorly considered as they suggest it's her responsibility to repeatedly attempt to convince him to respect her basic bodily autonomy and privacy, rather than his responsibility to not take non-consensual photos like a creepy predator.", "No, taking pictures of breastfeeding isn\u2019t necessarily sexualizing it or behaving like a pervert. He is recording a very intimate, special time between mother and baby, yes, but if breastfeeding isn\u2019t sexual, then having pictures of it also isn\u2019t inherently sexual.\n\nThe better equivalent would be photographing someone on their deathbed since it\u2019s a private, intimate time that it\u2019s thoughtless and invasive to take pictures of/during without express permission.", "She says she only deleted photos that she was in. If he respected her choice and didn\u2019t boundary stomp her for supposedly knowing better than her what she will or won\u2019t regret then the pictures would\u2019ve never been there to delete.", "Reading this is so depressing. The misogyny is coming from inside the house... well, most houses, apparently.", "So what do you suggest to help the situation? Dox OP so you can find out who her ex and go talk to him and tell him to stop doing it?", "I would say it\u2019s the equivalent of photographing someone on a nude beach, and I would argue that doing that without permission is perverted too. Being partially or fully undressed isn\u2019t inherently sexual but I think a person taking photos without explicit permission (especially when, as in this case, it\u2019s a person who has previously had a sexual relationship with the subject which colours their view of their body) would be perverted there too.\n\ne: I think the question of whether he\u2019s a pervert is a minor one, once she said no photos it should have been done, but I\u2019m surprised at the number of people calling *her* an asshole for calling him a pervert, especially when she has better insight into his motivations than the rest of us do.", "I don't care if I'm tits out or fully clothed. If I tell someone, \"Please don't take my picture right now,\" they should respect my wishes. I think people are missing the point by focusing on the breast-feeding aspect.", "feeding your child isn\u2019t sexual, but there are still weirdos who sexualize breastfeeding because ~breasts~. that being said, if OP says no to having any part of her breasts being a photo, no matter what is happening in that photo, then OPs wishes need to be respected and the ex should not have those photos whatsoever", "A doctor's physical involves sensitive body parts but isn't automatically sexual. Having a shower involves sensitive body parts but isn't automatically sexual. Going to the toilet involves sensitive body parts but isn't automatically sexual. Breastfeeding involves sensitive body parts but isn't automatically sexual. Walking topless in 40 degree heat involves sensitive body parts but isn't automatically sexual.\n\nDoesn't mean anyone has an automatic right to take a picture of someone in any of these situations without their express knowledge and consent.", "I breastfeed my child in public and anyone thinking ot is inappropriate can stuff it. \n\nBut I will call anyone who takes a photo of it while I am saying 'no' a lot of ugly words if they don't stop. One of them might be 'pervert' depending on the situation. \n\nI don't think it is sexual. However, it is still my body and my right to refuse it being photographed."]}
