Here\u2019s why:\n\n1) She doesn\u2019t want pictures taken of her. She explicitly stated it to her ex. He has no right to do so. Will she regret it in the future? She might, but that\u2019s not her exes call to make. OP made her choice. Ex can literally take pictures of his baby without the unwilling party involved. \n\n2) Is breastfeeding sexual? No. But OP still gets to decide when pictures of her are taken! It\u2019s gross to ignore her lack of consent. Breastfeeding can also be extremely stressful, and Ex is just making it more so. \n\n3) She gave birth two months ago. She doesn\u2019t like the pictures. Why can\u2019t he leave her alone? What is his problem? Why does he need pictures of her? \n\nEveryone here is so quick to say that OP had no right to go through his phone bc privacy and that she didn\u2019t have his permission. What about her privacy being violated? He does not need to have pictures of her that she doesn\u2019t want to be taken. He has absolutely no right to do that without her permission. Under these circumstances, she has every right to delete the pictures! She didn\u2019t snoop on his phone, she just deleted pictures of HERSELF that she didn\u2019t consent to being taken.

Your consent is more important than his intent. I have no idea what is up with this sub today, but it's super disappointing.", "NTA - You told him you didn't want your picture taken and he refused to respect that.  I don't care what he says about not posting--that's the same thing said by every AH who ever revenge-p0rn'd someone.

No, but you wouldn't have done it if he respected your boundaries", "Normally I wouldn't condone going through someone's phone without their consent but nta because you openly communicated your discomfort with photos (regardless of bf) and he violated it, he wasn't going to delete them.

You don't like photos of you NOW, but in three or five or ten years he's right, you probably are going to regret not having them.\n\nMy Ex took my son when he was a baby and disappeared. I have no more than 10 actual photos of my son when he was a baby, and not one single photo of me holding him, or him sleeping on my chest. Or holding my finger like he did. Or me feeding him or anything else. Not one. And that kills me every day. \n\nYou don't have to keep all of them but keep some of them. The candid photos are the most important. They aren't fake. They're real. They are actual life and actual memories, not posed to create a curated impression.", "I would say YTA but he was taking unwanted photos of your breastfeeding.

Any other issues raise separately", "*EDIT: Changing to NTA after being informed with more info*\n\nNTA - I get your feelings and concerns as they are valid but I do think that should've been a conversation to be had. More than likely, he just wants as many pictures of his child to remember these moments while he can and unfortunately, you'd be in majority of those whether he wanted you in them or not. The breast feeding pictures are a little weird, but you really should've talked to him first before taking your own initiative to invade privacy.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nNot your phone and a violation of their privacy", "Well, one could argue that YTA for taking his phone without permission BUT he didn\u2018t respect your boundaries in the first place by taking pictures of you even though you told him you didn\u2018t like that. So NTA from my point of view.", "My vote is YTA but not even for going through his phone (which is messed up in itself) but dude seems like he's legitimately just trying to preserve these moments.  You didn't say one thing that would even remotely indicate that he's doing anything inappropriate with the pictures so you calling him a pervert was excessive, dramatic and uncalled for.\n\nAnd yes, from one parent to another the reality is that you would most likely appreciate these pictures later down the road.", "Normally, its a YTA move to go through someone's phone unattended without permission.\n\nHowever, i would say you are NTA here because ex does not have permission to be taking pictures of you after you already said no, especially breastfeeding pictures which is just fucking weird and definitely not ok. He can take a picture of his kid without you in it if he cares so much, and if i had a nickel for every \"i promise i won't show these pictures to anyone else\" that didn't keep their word, i could be retired on some tropical island now.\n\nLet this hopefully be a lesson for both to respect boundaries, though if you both still struggle to respect boundaries i would follow through on that threat to move out.", "Eh, he\u2019s kinda got a point.

If he\u2019s not the father, then NTA.", "ESH but mostly YTA.\n\nFirstly, the fact you're living with your ex is unsettling  in itself, but alas. \n\nSecondly, that's his child too.

He was told he should have called the police to get the object back, but he tried that first and the police were no help at all.", "yes but other than the breast feeding pictures\n\nshe deleted the kids pictures and herself", "I feel her calling him perverted is related to a gut feeling", "ANY picture with her in it.

Also, the pictures were taken in their house since they live together.", "Yes, where she has a reasonable expectation of privacy."]}
