If he seems apprehensive about spending money, make sure you get to the root of the issue and not make too many assumptions.", "Nta, but you may want to go back to work and build up a run fund in case of divorce.

All you asking for is a chance to go out and be celebrated by your family and that\u2019s too much for him.

Husband is a brat.", "I want to go back to workforce. But he always says, he is earning enough(it's 6 digit LPA) for the family, it's more important that I stay home and be there for kids. We go for many weekend activities for kids(that doesn't includes eating out). And he doesn't hesitate to buy gadgets every now and then or go for a drink with friends. So I guess we are doing fine.", "He is \"my way or high way\" kind of person. Either you do as he says, or he'll stop talking. He compare it to his birthday. Last 3 times, he'll be birthday depressed on his day. Not talking much, even if we bring cake and gifts, he gets uncomfortable.", "Did you miss her comment about her husband but wanting her to work?", "She states she is a foodie hence the fine dining! She wants a nice meal with her family.", "What's stopping you from actually looking at your finances?\n\nAgain, things might be fine, but I'm only hearing speculation from you and you're giving us a sense that he is tense about money.", "Ok let's work through your information. You aren't exactly sure about how much he earns or how much he has saved. Have you seen his paychecks? His bank account? Do you have access to his bank account? Is your name on it? Is your name on the deed to the house? \n\nHe says he earns enough for the family; he buys gadgets for himself; he goes out for drinks with his friends; you go for weekend activities with the kids. He says you don't need to go back to work. \n\nBut on the other hand, he also says it's a waste of money for the family to go to a fine restaurant for your birthday and you suspect he may have planned this lunch with his boss for the same day as your birthday dinner so that you would have to cancel your reservation at the fine restaurant and instead you would have lunch for free with his boss. He also states that he finds it stressful to buy birthday gifts for you as it's expensive, and he wants you to stop expecting money to be spent on you for your birthday.\n\nThese facts contradict each other. If he has enough and you don't need to work, then why is he worried about taking you to a nice restaurant for your birthday? When he says he has \"enough,\" does this mean that he has enough for OTHER family priorities BUT NOT for your birthday dinner or for your birthday gift. \n\nI can think of three different possibilities:\n\n1) Your expectations for your birthday are out of line with your other family expenditures. If you spend $10 per person to, say, go to the zoo with the children on the weekend, but you want to spend $150 per person for your birthday dinner, then it's possible he might be able to afford the zoo but not your birthday.\n\nor\n\n2) He is not really making enough money. Is it possible that he has debt that you don't know about? However this would conflict with his preference that you do not go back to work. \n\nor\n\n3) He does not value spending money on your happiness. Trips with the kids don't bother him because he values their happiness. Drinks with friends don't bother him because he values his own happiness. Your birthday dinner and gifts bother him because he doesn't value your happiness and therefore sees it as a waste of money to spend money on things that have no other purpose than to make you happy. \n\nI can't really make a judgement yet, I would say you need more INFO on 1 and 2. If the answer is 3, then you are NTA.", "So I guess we\u2019re doing fine.\n\n^^^\n\nWhy don\u2019t you know?

I also love diamond jewellery and exotic vacations. It doesn\u2019t mean my husband can afford any of that for my birthday.", "I made the reservation.
