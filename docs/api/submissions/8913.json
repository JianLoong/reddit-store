Highly doubt it, but either way, let's say you did. That would mean that your son was 12 when this happened. Did you force him to accept this \"new mom\" as his own? Probably, judging from how harsh you are towards him for him not accepting your borderline predatory relationship/marriage. \n\nYou can say that he \"doesn't get along\" with his siblings, but it's more likely that he doesn't want to interact with them. And children are easily offended and will cry if a grown up that you guys probably told them loves them and would love to play with them, doesn't end up interacting with them at all. That usually makes a child cry from my experience.\n\nYour wife probably continuously tries to push to be called mom, despite her being in the age range that she should rather be his sister than mother. \n\nAnd to top it all off, you said no to your son without hesitation when he asked for help because you can't handle him not accepting your poor choices. Just like you won't accept his poor choice of throwing a party. From what you wrote, he never threw a party at your place, when staying with you.

Regardless of \"being more mature and grown\", someone who is 15-20 years older than me has a higher chance of having financial leverage over me due to (likely) being far more along in their career.  \n\nLike look at the alleged prostitution/trafficking case of Rep. Gaetz. From what I call, some of the women were minors and some just above the legal age. Yeah, those who are legal age may be \"adults\", but there's a big power imbalance between Congresspeople and young adult sex workers (let alone minors!)", "Oh gee really?

People just are able to draw logical conclusions. Why would you need someone to tell you something you can logically conclude from a situation? \n\nThere are sadly people who wrongly believe that the only true information is something someone literally tells you. This mindset makes people extremely likely to ignore obvious abuse. Children being beaten daily who never tell their teacher don't get reported. How could the teacher ever know? The child wasn't telling, the child is afraid. \n\nAs you are a victim of abuse I urge you to reconsider spreading this kind of harmful misinformation. \n\nOps started dating his current wife when she was 21. They met earlier. \nOps wife was abused by her mother (according to op). He therefore met her as an emotionally damaged below 21. \nAbuse arrests development. Her mindset therefore was even younger. \nHe was a much much older dude.

Blame your grandparents.\" \n\nAnd then the grandparents repeat the exact same thing the parents said, and it keeps going like that.\n\nAttributing everything wrong with someone to how they were raised might be technically accurate, but it accomplishes nothing.", "Did the 38 year old woman text you personally and tell you that when she was 21 she was groomed?

This infantilization of adult women is downright sexist, even if you think your intervention is needed to save someone from making a bad decision.\n\nThis guy is probably a creep, but that doesn't make an adult woman a \"child\" or mean that she can't make the decision to marry a creep if she wants.", "Opinions on whether a 21yo is an adult who can make their own decisions or not aside, none of this has anything to do with the current situation of whether or not OP is an asshole for not being willing to house his adult son, who got kicked out of his place due to his own fault, and who doesn't get along with (to put it nicely) 4 out of the 5 people who already live there.", "Agreed! I\u2019m a 34F and boy, was I an idiot with many self esteem issues when I was 21 \ud83e\udd23", "I am in fact 30, not 21.

All we know is that OP has been with someone for 17 years who is younger than him. To assume he groomed her is honestly ridiculous. OP was with someone who is the same age as him for several years and then is now with someone who is younger than him for several years. Unless OP has a history of dating young women or there are actual signs of predatory behaviour than OP didn\u2019t groom her. She is 38 right now and they have been together for 17 years.

If he abandoned his wife to start a family with a 21 year old while his son was less than 10 years younger than her it is absolutely going to cause huge issues and resentment for that child with long lasting effects into adult hood. He took a child who was just approaching their teenage years and tried to force a women who had just left her teenage years to be their mother, that\u2019s fucked.
