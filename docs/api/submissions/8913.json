The current wife may or may not be responsible for some of it, she was however only 21 at the start so I\u00b4m leaning towards OP being a creep on that front. Stuff she did later on being on her of course.  So ESH, except the younger children, who wouldn't benefit at all from the son moving back in. No winners here, only losers.", "Creep", "They got married at 26 I believe from previous thread started dating at 21", "How were you able to see his other posts?\nThis is the only one I can find!", "So you started dating a teenager before you were divorced, and nearly 40. \n\nI have a feeling you\u2019re not such a reliable narrator OP.", "You made this post very cleverly to sound like you are actually not TA. But you are. Here is why your son probably ended up the way he did:\n\nAs a 39 year old you married a 21 year old after supposedly already leaving your ex wife before there was a relationship with the other woman. Highly doubt it, but either way, let's say you did. That would mean that your son was 12 when this happened. Did you force him to accept this \"new mom\" as his own? Probably, judging from how harsh you are towards him for him not accepting your borderline predatory relationship/marriage. \n\nYou can say that he \"doesn't get along\" with his siblings, but it's more likely that he doesn't want to interact with them. And children are easily offended and will cry if a grown up that you guys probably told them loves them and would love to play with them, doesn't end up interacting with them at all. That usually makes a child cry from my experience.\n\nYour wife probably continuously tries to push to be called mom, despite her being in the age range that she should rather be his sister than mother. \n\nAnd to top it all off, you said no to your son without hesitation when he asked for help because you can't handle him not accepting your poor choices. Just like you won't accept his poor choice of throwing a party. From what you wrote, he never threw a party at your place, when staying with you. Then again, he probably didn't have time, because he was probably working his ass off to have the money to move out from home as soon as possible. \n\nSo yeah, YTA", "ESH. I wouldn't want him in my house either. Sounds like the worst. But that's your fault because you failed as a father. At 39 started dating a 21 year old. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the reason why you divorced your first wife. At 12 years old he was closer in age to her than you. Congrats on fucking up your son and I hope you don't fuck up your 3 other kids.", "ESH - it sounds like your grown up son has real issues and it wouldn\u2019t be a great idea to have him around your wife and kids. However, you seem like a real creep who takes no responsibility for his own role in the terrible relationship he has with his kid.", "YTA for being a 40 year old pursuing a 21 year old. Omg.", "YTA because your son's issues clearly stem from you. This chicken is coming home to roost. I don't know how I'd react if my dad dated a woman 9 years older than me after the split.", "ESH. Your son because he sucks but you because ew why tf were you dating a 21 year old at your age???????? That's super creepy.\n\nETA why are you avoiding all of the questions about your unsettling marriage", "You've got to be incredibly immature because normally a 39 year old man should have nothing in common with a 21 year old girl. \n\nYTA. Your son sounds like a dick, but I think that's because the apple hasn't fallen far from the tree.", "YTA. Changed out old wife for younger model, hates older kid and adores younger kids... for you it's all about the newest and shiniest toy, isn't it? \n\nWe're going to see you in here in a few years, asking if you're an arse for trading in the current wife for one who's only 9 years older than your grandchild.", "[removed]", "NTA foe not letting him move in.

Vile", "NTA- tough love is...well...tough.  I applaud you for putting your wife and younger children 1st.  Please don't shut him out though.  Offer support.

You people are all CAP. Get over the age difference. His son has unresolved problems and needs therapy,  not moving in with dad and making his new family uncomfortable", "NTA. Not sure what\u2019s up with the pitchforks about the age difference between your wife and yourself but that has nothing to do with the situation. Your adult son wants to stay with you, after getting evicted, and your family, that he\u2019s previously hurt/made feel miserable. NTA for telling him no. Do you and him need counseling? Yeah. But NTA I\u2019m saying no.", "I know everyone is giving opinions based off your relationship with your now wife but seriously he\u2019s 29 he shouldn\u2019t be getting any help period or a place to stay.

Do you ***REALLY*** have to ask if you're the asshole in this situation?", "I'm gonna stick to the point here and say NTA.", "NTA - Your son is grown and has to live with the consequences of his actions.", "NTA. Your refusal likely saved your marriage. If I was in your wife\u2019s place, I would be in a hotel with the kids or I\u2019d kick you out if you let your son move in.

That is a problem.  He very likely sees and feels it.  Which probably only makes his issues worse.  You need to fix that.", "YTA we all know what you did. 39 dating a 21 year old. Can't believe you convicted yourself you did no wrong in your previous relationship.\n\nA lot of your son's resentment came from your action. Selfish. So selfish.", "That was the first thing that came to my mind. 39 dating a 21 years old......", "I was thinking that. Don\u2019t misunderstand me the 29-year-old son needs to grow up and I don\u2019t necessarily blame them for not letting him come back home.

For a second I thought I was the only reasonable person here who understands the complexities of life. Also none of this changes the fact that a 29 year old needs to grow the hell up.
