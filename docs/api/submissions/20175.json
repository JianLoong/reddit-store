Neither your cousin or your father need your permission to do this. You really think she wouldn't rather her own dad be there to walk her down the aisle?", "> why did every assume I would be okay with it\n\nThey didn't assume you would be okay with it, they assumed that it was nothing to do with you, which it isn't.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nI've never heard someone say, \"I want my dad's first time to be with me\" before...\n\n\nThat's... wow.", "YTA. Grow up and quit acting like someone half your age. You said it yourself; she's close to your dad, her uncle. It makes perfect sense for her to ask her uncle to escort her down the aisle in place of her father; you know your dad's deceased brother. \n\nYou're parents are right. You are being dramatic. You are being selfish. Keep this up and maybe you won't have to worry about seeing your father walk his niece down the aisle because chances are you won't be invited.", ">why did every assume I would be okay with it. \n\nBecause it's none of your business? It's not your decision to make, but the decision of your father and your cousin. This is kinda selfish of you to think they have to ask you lol.\n\nNow, if you want to still be invited to your cousin's wedding, I strongly advise you to grow up and to stop being so self-centered. \n\nYTA btw.", "YTA. So just to be clear. Everyone in your life is telling you how wrong you are.  Everyone on the Internet is doing the same even after only hearing your point of view. Yet somehow I get the feeling you are still thinking to yourself that EVERYONE is wrong, somehow.", "YTA - I\u2019m amazed this even has to be explained. \n\n1) it\u2019s HER wedding \n\n2) HER FATHER PASSED AWAY\n\n3) she feels close enough to your dad to ask him to give her away, which says a lot about how good of a person your dad is \n\n4) your parents are right, you are being very over dramatic and selfish. \n\nThis legit doesn\u2019t even have anything to do with you outside of you getting an invite (if I was your cousin this would be where you\u2019d be uninvited altogether).", "YTA. \n\nWhen he walks you down the aisle he\u2019ll be walking his daughter down the aisle. You\u2019re crazy if you think this won\u2019t be an amazingly important moment for him. \n\nAnd you\u2019re crazy if you think him having already walked your cousin down the aisle will in any way diminish this moment for either of you.", "YTA - you are, indeed, being over-dramatic and selfish. Good Lord. I can't believe you typed that all out and thought \"yes, I am justified!\"", "YTA and your parents are right, you are not only being melodramatic, you're being SHOCKINGLY selfish and childish, and I would add hateful as well, considering the reasons why your cousin is asking.\n\nYour cousin was not required to ask you, and the fact that you think she should have is appalling. Honestly, I rarely say this, because normally I'm of the belief that feelings are instinctive and visceral, and not really in our control, but THIS? No. Absolutely not. You don't even get to have feelings about this, much less suggest that you should have some say in the situation.\n\nYOUR FATHER IS A HUMAN BEING WHO EXISTS INDEPENDENTLY OF HIS ROLE AS \"YOUR DAD\". HE DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU. HE IS NOT YOURS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT. He is a person, an adult with feelings and thoughts. The very thought that you get any say in his life or what he chooses to do with it is so selfish that if I were your parent I'd be shocked and embarrassed. I would feel like I'd failed as a parent.\n\nBeyond that, you are not losing anything by his doing this beautiful, kind thing for your cousin. \"Being first\" is not a thing in the world of adults. We leave that behind in the schoolyard. Someone else being walked down the aisle by your dad will not take away from your future experience with him, because that will (hopefully) be the first and only time that he walks YOU down the aisle.\n\nYour cousin lost her dad forever. She has to get married knowing that her father won't be there. She has to do LIFE knowing that her father won't be there. And you are being so petty and miserable that you begrudge her a few moments on the arm of a beloved older cousin on a bittersweet day, because you \"want to be the first\". Shame on you. Of course YTA.", "YTA. An entitled, selfish AH. And don\u2019t worry about your own trip down the aisle - with that attitude I doubt that\u2019s in your near future.", "YTA is this a joke? Are you 5? This is pathetic honestly like why does it matter that she\u2019s doing it with him before you, what difference does it make?\nYou even said they were close lol. You are a child grow tf up.", "YTA. \n\nShe lost her father and has chosen your father for the honor.  Also, it's not like he can't walk you down the aisle because he walked her down the aisle. Also, since you are his daughter, it will be a singular experience for him that won't be affected by being there for your cousin.", "Dude you still get him to walk you down the aisle, she\u2019ll never get that with her bio dad", "YTA\n\nYou still have your Dad, she doesn\u2019t, instead of moaning about how unfair it is you should be proud she gave your Dad this honour and thinks so highly of him. This will be a very hard time for your cousin, show some empathy", "YTA - Grow up, you are not the only family member.  FFS, she lost her dad and respects yours enough to reach out to him.", "YTA, too old for this nonsense.", "YTA. Grow up.", "YTA. Your parents are right, you are being over dramatic and very selfish. Your father was probably pleased and honored to do this for your cousin that he is close to. \n\nThe only thing I think everyone assumed was that you would know this is not your business. Please let this go before you embarrass yourself further.", "YTA - Way to make someone else's 'big' day about you. You are upset because your dad will have a an experience for the first time and it wont be shared with you? Her dad died so you of course double down and whine why are they doing this to you. Totally not selfish - Are you sure you are 24?", "As someone who lost her dad before she got married, YTA big time. I would have given anything to have had my dad in that moment but I too ended up choosing a family member I felt close to to stand in for my dad. If anything, it should be a reflection of how amazing your dad is that she chose him out of everyone else and imagine how he felt being asked. Grow up. \n*edited for typos", "I walked my niece down the aisle last April. She\u2019s been NC with her father for over 15 years and I\u2019ve stepped in the best I could.\n\nI show this post to my daughter will walk down the aisle next June. I asked her if she ever felt like this. Her response was OP is YTA who would even think like that. What is OP had an older sister.", "YTA - You are being overdramatic and selfish.  You should be honored your cousin thinks the same about your Dad as you do.", "You are taking a beating here. \n\nLook at it from a different perspective for a moment if you will\u2026\n\nWhy not be happy for your father that has such an impact on your cousin? You should be proud and supportive of this.\n\nI love my uncle and he is my favorite person on the face of the planet. I would gladly ask him to do this for me and my cousins would not think twice about supporting him.\n\nThat being said\u2026YTA. Sorry.", "YTA. Work on maturing.", "YTA, you're his daughter, when he walks you down the aisle it will be a totally different experience for him.  Get over yourself. I had to double check your age because you're acting like a teenager.", "<<I was being over dramatic and selfish>>\n\nDamn straight. Your behavior is terrible and completely unempathetic. \n\nYTA.", "I mean, your feelings are your feelings, but yea, YTA.  Do you think your father loves you less because he has room in his heart to support your fatherless cousin?  This is REALLY selfish of you. Think about what kind of person you want people to think you are for the next 50 years, and try to live that until it's true.", "Of course YTA. My dad had three daughters, and I\u2019m the youngest. Was him walking me down the aisle somehow less special because it wasn\u2019t his first time?", "You realize that you may never get married. Not everyone does.", "Ohh how I wonder that you are not married yet. YTA, you are completely out of line.", "YTA.  You seem to think that you are the star of other people's lives.  Newsflash: you aren't.  This is between your cousin and your father and has nothing to do with you.  Grow up.", "YTA. Your dad can walk you both down the isle. Why are you obsessed with being first? I had 2 sisters, and only 1 of them could be the \"first\", yet it doesn't make it any less special. Love is infinite, so stop being so selfish. Also, nobody asked for or wants your opinion, it has nothing to do with you.", "YTA what a petty thing to be so worked up about, stop acting like a brat and be grateful and happy you got a standup dad to fill in for your cousins wedding", "YTA.\n\nHonest question: why does this bother you so much? Because it comes across like you are threatened by this relationship.\n\nThere is no reason your father doing this would lessen or cheapen if/when he walks you down the aisle. The fact that you *feel* like that\u2019s not the case is worth exploring for your own peace of mind.", "YTA, her wedding isn\u2019t about you and she\u2019s already missing her actual father being there.", "YTA - the amount of self-centeredness and entitlement would be astonishing if it wasn't so sad. This is not your wedding. Who your cousin asks to walk her down the aisle is her choice (a personal choice) and in this case its her beloved uncle she is choosing. She does not need your permission. It's your fathers choice whether he wants to accept and he has. Again he does not need your permission. You have no involvement. \n\n I think the real issue is the \"first time\". You have made your cousin's wedding into a competition - drawing comparisons between the two of you. This will only lead you to misery. The relationship between you and your father is inherently different to the relationship between your cousin and her uncle. Stop comparing. Stop competing. \n\nDifferent life experiences. Different relationships. And when/if you get married, different weddings.", "You\u2019re a huge asshole. Your feelings are not even valid here.", "You still have your dad. YTA", "Weird that you think your dad or cousin needed your permission for something that doesn't have anything to do with you. YTA", "YTA \nThis has nothing to do with you. How self-centered are you to make this about you, when your cousin is probably wishing it could have been her dad. You don\u2019t own your father and neither of them need your permission to do this.\nGet over yourself. \n\nYou say you wanted your father\u2019s first experience walking someone down the aisle to be with you, but what you don\u2019t realise is that the two are not the same; walking you down the aisle will be different than walking your cousin down the aisle. Because you\u2019re different people. It doesn\u2019t matter who does it first.", "Starting to see why you aren\u2019t married yet. You need to seek therapy for this Main Character Syndrome you have.\n\nSuck it up, apologise and let your cousin be happy.\n\nYTA", "YTA Wow, this is horrible.", "YTA. Your Dad stepped up as a father forgive to her, obviously she\u2019d want him to walk her down the isle.", "Over dramatic and selfish?  Yes. They\u2019re right.

You suck. Are you REALLY 24 and not 14? I feel sorry for your dad that you're his only daughter. What a rough 24 years I'm sure it has been for him.", "YTA. This takes nothing away from you and could mean everything to your cousin. What would you do if you had an older sister who got married first?", "YTA, you're also selfish, spoiled, and entitled.

Maybe you shouldn't be invited to the wedding so you can't cause any more dramatics!", "YTA\n\nThis is obviously important to your cousin, especially since her own dad isn't here to do it. There's nothing wrong with what he is doing and I'm sure he's more than happy to do it, just as he will be thrilled to walk you down the aisle at your wedding, it's not a competition here!", "Big time YTA. This is a very loving thing for your dad to do, and it clearly means a lot to your cousin. You sound like you\u2019re a child. You should be happy for your cousin, and grateful she feels close enough to your dad to ask him to do this. I hope that you read these comments and reflect, mature, and apologize. You\u2019re being a huge brat and AH", "YTA - A massive one.  You ae being over dramatic and selfish in every way.  You should be proud that your dad is so awesome that she would ask him.", "YTA Although it's understandable to feel disappointed your dad is experiencing this with your cousin first, neither of them need to ask you first.

Yta", "YTA \n\nThis literally has nothing to do with you. Like, at all.", "Pro tip: most bridezillas wait until they are actually engaged to be narcissistic a-holes, so congrats on getting a jump on it. YTA.

If they had asked you would you have said yes?\n\nYou have feelings and that's not wrong. You need to think about if the feeling you're having makes sense. No one is taking anything away from you, this situation has nothing to do with you. Your dad will still never have walked his daughter down the aisle. He still has the opportunity to do so if/when you get married. Her dad does not have the oppu because he's dead. Why shouldn't your cousin ask your dad to do this?", "YTA.\n\nYou should be proud & honored that your dad was asked to walk your cousin down the aisle.

There are just some things that aren't done. \n\nObviously, op gives a damn about this customary tradition, or we wouldn't be here.  She's allowed to be upset. I'm sure if she chooses someone else to walk her down the aisle, her dad will be upset. It goes both ways. If you hurt someone, that can damage the relationship. That's the consequence of hurting someone. \n\nIn the case of a sister, she doesn't have a sister. If she did, I'm sure she wouldn't be upset because her dad would also be her sisters dad. I would think that one was obvious.", "Dad wasn\u2019t being an ass. Someone else asked him if he was nervous (in my hearing range) so he was being funny.  I was the only bride he got to negotiate a bride price for. It\u2019s the possibility of \u201cstealing\u201d the specialness between father and OP I\u2019m thinking of.", "Could have been a tragic Ikea accident... lost wandering forced to live off of meatballs.", "I think you're over-intepreting the post to try and fit an agenda.", "Oh how I wish I had an award to give this comment", "I read that in Veruca Salt\u2019s voice", "Don't worry, sounds like he'll have plenty of opportunities to walk you down the aisle in the future.", "OP would probably act the same if it was a younger sister.", "[removed]", "This was a gross, incredibly insulting comment that you took too far. Why on earth would you imply her father might not want to walk her down the aisle or that he\u2019ll be dead by the time she gets married. Also this post is in no way what daddy issues are.", "I think the issue is that she *doesn\u2019t* have sisters (she makes a point to say she is the only daughter), so she is understandably put out that this will no longer be a special experience just for the two of them.", "From OPs post, it seems like she would be throwing the same fit if it was a sister walking down the aisle first as well.", "Because she\u2019s his daughter not a fill-in", "\u201cI\u2019ll play the victim!\u201d\n\n*\u201d\u2026 your whole life.\u201d*", "Bingo.", "Yeah, OP could be inadvertently ruining the whole tradition for everyone. Hopefully she hasn\u2019t done too much damage and can back track and make amends. At least if she realizes she is wrong about this.", "Woman here! That's how I feel too. She is incredibly selfish.", "I'm a woman and it seems super shitty to me too. OP's sharing a very unique thought process.", "Of course she\u2019s allowed to feel how she wants. And that can make her an asshole. Im allowed to feel jealous that the kid dying of cancer got to meet John Cena, and it makes me an asshole. Both are true. To top it off, OP also acted on her feelings in this case. Total AH", "And i would think its obvious that her dad clearly wants to do this her cousn wants this Op only cares about what she wants and the fact she wants this tradition she is clearly being selfish and honestly if i knew the neighbor i wouldnt care if they teach my kid to ride a bike and yes id be pissed if someone posted a picture of my child not because they did it before me but because my newborn baby has no business being online but ye my pont wasnt about op wanting the tradition you said youre sure ops father would be upset if her uncle did stuff with her and i was pointing out he might not cus while Op cares about tradition doesnt mean her father does", "You and I have different definitions of \u201ctragic.\u201d I think haunting an Ikea sounds awesome", "The word \"lost\" could mean two things in the context of the post, either mean they died or that they divorced the cousin's mom and moved away, whilst not taking custody of the cousin. It most likely means that he died though.", "or none", "i read one of these once where that was exactly why someone was upset.", "I hope this is a true moment of self-reflection for you. I think it is a great idea to discuss this with your therapist because something is driving this possessiveness and it is not going to lead to positive outcomes.", "> I told them that if they even they ever mentioned some girl was like a sister to them I would be pissed and fight her (well i was more explict than that, like actions that would lead me to jail) in a half joking way\n\nI'm sorry, what? That is, I don't even have the words for how messed up this is.", "Girl. That is super crazy. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re realizing it though. That\u2019s a step in the right direction.", "Good on you for recognizing it isn\u2019t healthy. Possessiveness like this hurts the possessor the most longterm.\n\nNo condolences wanted or needed, just a perspective? My parents are dead. Sometimes there are moments when it feels good to pretend, even just for a second, there are here with me. When your dad walks her down the aisle she will be imagining it is her own dad on her arm. Believe me.", "Ahem, it seems to be that you're only possessive and controlling of your *male* family members. Maybe you should explore why that is. You seem like the sort of woman who needs to be the main woman in the lives of every man that is related to her.  Not a good look."]}
