He's the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. He feels the same about me and that has been communicated for a bit now. We are both still in school and have jobs. I have 2 jobs and go to school full time and he has 1 job but goes to a much more academically challenging school than mine. (I'm in trade school and he's doing a lot of challenging academics) but I seem to have far less free time than him. \n\nHe feels he always has to push his schedule around mine and that makes me in the wrong. This post stemmed from a rare argument of ours about Halloween.  To him it's a holiday we always spend together and it means a lot to him. He didn't inform me of this presuming I know that already. He told me today, the night before Halloween.  I work every Monday until 7 and that's a given he can't see eachother after 9pm. He assumed since it's a holiday I don't work tonight and we would be spending it together. \n\nOnce he asked me when we were meeting up tomorrow I told him I worked and he got rather upset with me. I teach kids in the trade I am in school for and simply can't reschedule work. In this industry reputation is everything especially locally and I can't not show up for my kids. I proposed rescheduling our time together but he is extremely upset with me. I feel he didn't communicate his plans with me and he feels I didn't do the same and that since he always moves his schedule around for me I should do the same for tomorrow. His plans were to have dinner and watch movies with me at the house because we would have some rare alone time and we are both very private people.\n\n  I really do not know what to do and don't know whether or not I am the asshole.

Some times real life intercedes with googly eyed romance.  Spend another night together.  As adults you have to be more flexible when you celebrate most holidays.", "NTA at all. I had a bf who never told when he planned something and then got all upset when I couldn't go, and he was 'I assumed...' I told him way too many times that I hated the fact he assumed everything, it's not that hard to communicate but it seems like some people think we have the super power of guessing.", "NTA.

Developing an adult relationship requires communicating about your goals, priorities, needs and boundaries in the major areas of life: career, education, home, family, relationship, marriage, children, religion, finance....\nYou both have career ambitions that make education a priority now. And you need to support yourselves. School and work are high priority. Your relationship should be supportive of that, not in competition. \n\nBecause of this, his expecting you to miss your shift at work because he wants to party and \"needs\" you to party with him gives me pause. The elements of clinging and expecting you to lose income because \"he needs you\" to have his good time are red flags. He managed to have fun before. You are not his accessory to be ready for service as \"required\" by his imagined rules for your behavior.", "NTA. Just because your boyfriend worships Halloween does not grant it National Holiday status, absolutely no one gets Halloween off because it\u2019s a \u201choliday\u201d. You seem to be grounded in reality and your bf is a good-time friend. His head is up his butt if he doesn\u2019t realize that you are working very hard on your future and your education and career and appreciate that about you. His only concern is his own good time. I\u2019d keep my eyes open if I were you. He doesn\u2019t care how hard you\u2019re working until it infringes on HIS idea of a good time. That\u2019s a bad attitude in a partner.", "Somehow I don\u2019t think this is about Halloween.  You mentioned that your bf is always having to work around your schedule.  To me, this feels like him wanting you to work around his schedule for once, wanting you to give some.", "Not to mention, Halloween isn\u2019t really a holiday as in the observed sense in the word for federal holidays. It is for children;  and if adults want to celebrate, it\u2019s usually on the weekend beforehand.", "Unless A) you have kids and are taking them trick-or-treating or B) it falls on either a Friday or Saturday night and you want to go out!!!", "Sorry I should have clarified that, we've been dating for nearly 2 years and known eachother for 3.
