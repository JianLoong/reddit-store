No offense to OP but I don't want my baby touching strangers who might pass something on...", "Yes. NTA.  Parents of babies and very young children seem to think that they are the only ones in the universe who ever had a child and that their little darling is so adorable that it gives them a free pass for lots of behavior that would normally be rude at best.

It's hard to have a rambunctious kid in an aisle seat and keep them safe + people not annoyed even if you are really paying attention to them, and it doesn't sound like this mom was doing that. If she couldn't control the child in a middle seat, and the partner was completely ignoring it all, I have a feeling that a move to the aisle seat would have meant their kid was hanging out in the aisle.  \n\nNet net- yes, it would involve a move for OP which could be annoying.

HOWEVER.....I would never encroach on others' space & was very vigilant in being \"a good passenger\" because I felt all the eye rolls & discomfort on fellow passengers faces as I sat next to them. I didn't blame them, I was the same when I was non-baby.\n\nBTW, because people could see my effort, they got more relaxed and were more forgiving if there was a cry or two.
