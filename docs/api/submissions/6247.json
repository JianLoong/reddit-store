You never know how people will react, you need to keep your kid safe and in the process keep your seat neighbors happy.", "So NTA - you were blunt but correct.  And the fact that they followed you to give you guff definitely makes them TAH", "NTA, coming from a parent. You weren\u2019t rude and she can\u2019t expect random strangers to be okay with a baby touching them. Parents like this are one of the reason why people hate seeing babies on flights.", "Nta. As someone with a baby, I dont know how dirty you are either so why would I want my baby touching you. This is just weird", "NTA.  You do not have to put up with anyone touching you on an airplane, adult or baby.", "NTA, some parents simply think that their baby is the cutest things ever and that everybody should smile at everything he/she does.", "NTA. You're entitled to your own personal space. The couple should've taken it much better.", "NTA. They chose to fly with a child they knew they couldn\u2019t control (because of the child\u2019s age) and refused to stop it from bothering a complete stranger. Then, when you asked that they do something they flipped out.  So many parents think they\u2019re entitled to whatever they want because they have a kid, but they aren\u2019t. I push back against that bullshit all the time and I suggest everyone else do it too. Unless there were fertility issues, having a baby is not an accomplishment and you don\u2019t deserve special treatment because of it.", "I work in a daycare with 1 year olds 40+ hours a week.\n\nThey're gross\n\nTheir hands are dirty, covered in slobber, snot, sticky from snacks, etc. I understand not wanting them touching you.

They may be 1 but far from dumb.\n\nNTA", "NTA. How dare you respect yourself enough to want what little personal space airplanes allow.", "NTA and I'm a total baby person.

The partner's an absolute ass for not noticing and doing something about it.", "NTA as someone who is a bit germaphobic, I hate when people touch my face at all, much less a baby whose hands I don\u2019t know where have been. You weren\u2019t rude, but they sure were.", "NTA- babies are sticky germ magnets. I would have done the same thing. I dont let anyone touch me w/out permission and youre never too young to start learning to keep your hands to yourself.", "NTA. It's common decency to not allow your child to continuously touch a stranger, even before the big C but especially now.\n\nI do feel kinda bad for that mom, though. She had to have the kid and the middle seat while her partner lived it up solo on the aisle? What an AH they are.", "NTA. Your only sin is not thinking that her kid is as perfect as she does.", "NTA as a parent who frequently traveled with my daughter at a young age I apologized in advance to any person sitting next to me and did my damn best to keep her contained. She was an active child so was difficult. Thankfully she was not a fussy child so rarely cried but she was friendly so had to learn at a young age that personal space was a thing. I was also the mom that bought a drink for the person if they chose one and carried extra seal snacks to make up for inconvenience lol. I also brought plenty of entertainment but she was a seasoned traveler before she was a year old lol. Their princess was not your problem but their own.", "NTA- I hate people who think their child is the center of the universe. It\u2019s just fucking entitlement.", "NTA. Why would anyone be ok with a baby constantly touching them like that.

I\u2019ve told seat kicking kids to stop. Parents don\u2019t like it, then stop your kids from kicking the seat.

The sullen father did nothing, while the mother tried desperately to contain the kid. It was a window into an incredibly dysfunctional family dynamic. If the father had stepped up a little bit, the experience of everyone would have been much improved.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nYou are fully justified in asking the parent to keep her infant out of your space.", "NTA. Parents can't completely control their child at all times, I get that... but preventing them from continually touching their seat neighbor is like the bare fucking minimum!", "NTA it is your personal space and asking that it not be violated is not too much to ask", "NTA my 2yr old went running after the waiter at one of our local restaurants (we are on very friendly terms with the family and staff who run it) and I was dashing after her as quickly as I could.  She managed to grab his hand before I got there and I was mortified. So no you aren't the AH. Normal people don't let their child go around grabbing strangers.", "NTA\n\nIf I saw my baby was touching someone else and I had the ability to move it elsewhere, that's what I'd automatically do.

I flew with my son as a lap infant at the same age and we purchased the middle seat between my husband and I for this reason. I have an active child who would never sit still for hours. We knew he would be happier sleeping in my lap than a car seat so we didn't bring it, but it also gave us a bit of space when he was awake and he couldn't hassle strangers.\n\nI'm very tolerant of children, but I wouldn't want a stranger's child touching me for hours either.", "NTA. No one wants a random baby bumping into them for hours. What a couple of jerks.", "NTA. I fly regularly with my three small children and would be absolutely mortified if they bothered another passenger.", "NTA. They weren\u2019t even trying to stop the baby from touching you. I get you can\u2019t control ever motion a baby makes but for real at least TRY.", "NTA - it\u2019s rude to have children touch strangers - that\u2019s also akin to allowing children to run around and disturb people. \n\nAlso\u2026 germs. COVID is still going around so personal space is needed. \n\nObviously the baby isn\u2019t at fault and the parent could have swapped to the aisle seat. \n\nIn saying that - I\u2019m also assuming her harsh language was also due to potentially you saying it not so politely as you think you did (?) \n\nAnywho NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's TAH move.\n\nAsking to move the baby was reasonable and rational, but you could probably learn to be a little polite.

Perhaps that's just how you've written it, but the way you communicate goes a long way and saying \"please keep your child from violating my personal space\" sure makes you seem like TA.\n\nAnother solution is to swap w the partner and take the aisle, have him/her in the middle, and the mom/child in the window seat.", "How dare you not eagerly worship my golden child!

No offense to OP but I don't want my baby touching strangers who might pass something on...", "Yes. NTA.  Parents of babies and very young children seem to think that they are the only ones in the universe who ever had a child and that their little darling is so adorable that it gives them a free pass for lots of behavior that would normally be rude at best.  I notice it often with folks with strollers who insist on never giving the slightest way to anyone else.  I raised 4 kids btw.", "Oh he noticed. He just didn\u2019t want to be a parent so joined in to his wife berating OP.", "There are, in fact, perfectly valid reasons to bring a young human being onto mass transit. Sometimes babies have to be moved from point A to point B, and sometimes the only feasible way to do that is via air transit.\n\nOP is NTA, and these parents were certainly entitled assholes, but violently ricocheting into \"children shouldn't exist in public spaces no matter what, under any circumstances, categorically,\" is not the answer.", "Nope. I don't want your kid touching me. You get one polite request to handle it. Then we'll have a problem\n\nAlso there's this sickness thing still going on. They don't mind their kid touching someone else's face?", "Op is nta. You, however, yta. Op has the right to their personal space.  Unwanted touch is disturbing, and the parents have a responsibility to do what they can to keep their offspring from being a nuisance to others, especially in a stressful and uncomfortable circumstance as a long flight. Op did say they asked the parent for a reasonable solution. That parent's response was unreasonable in the extreme.", "OP is rightfully frustrated. Babies don\u2019t understand many things such as: not putting random objects in their mouth, not touching strangers, being potty-trained, etc. That doesn\u2019t mean people have to accept those behaviors.\n\nIt\u2019s the parent\u2019s job to make sure random people aren\u2019t being violated by their child. Yes, that *is* a violation because the parents are continuing to let it happen when they know better.", "Move one kid one lap, or literally play a game of shells to move OP from a seat that they may have preferred? Hmmmmm. OP is NTA.

I think my little one is the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen but uh i don\u2019t expect anyone else to feel the same. I would be mortified if my nugget started caressing someone\u2019s face on a flight", "That is what I said. Be mad at the parents, not a goddamn baby. \n\nPeople have to, and do, accept those behaviours because even if they aren't going to have babies, they were once babies. \n\nBut ofc some people like op and yourself were assembled in a factory and have beef with a literal baby", "Having a toddler reaching into the aisle is disruptive to more people. Having them by a window is the best way to keep them far from others.  Super simple logic- keep them away from any other passenger not related to them. That's the window.", "I wonder how the parents would have reacted if you'd touched the baby back...NTA.", "No one is sitting in the isle, nor should someone stand there long enough that it's a constant experience. Still not sure if that logic is adding up.", "It's not a constant experience for one person, but kids can reach out at the wrong time and catch a person walking by, or- more likely- reach out at the wrong time and get clipped by a person or cart and get hit themselves. It's hard to have a rambunctious kid in an aisle seat and keep them safe + people not annoyed even if you are really paying attention to them, and it doesn't sound like this mom was doing that. If she couldn't control the child in a middle seat, and the partner was completely ignoring it all, I have a feeling that a move to the aisle seat would have meant their kid was hanging out in the aisle.  \n\nNet net- yes, it would involve a move for OP which could be annoying. But I'd personally rather take an aisle seat myself and move away from someone else's grabby child than the alternatives. At least in this case the flight wasn't fully booked and OP was able to escape."]}
