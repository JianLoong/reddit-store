The reason to keep baby in the middle instead of in the aisle is because the carts and people walking by can hit baby, pinch fingers etc. So you're right, but they were in a tough spot and probably steeped to their eyeballs in cortisol from the stress of traveling with baby. There was no need for anyone to be rude about the situation and it sounds like the flight attendant solved the problem appropriately. They were super out of line for approaching you after the flight. And they should have been embarrassed about baby constantly touching you, even if they felt they couldn't control it. That said, their crazy behavior was probably due to extreme stress. It really makes you crazy. So they're wrong, but try to cut them just a little slack. A little forgiveness and understanding, even though they're wrong. They're probably literally chemically a little bit crazy because of the situation. \n\nSource: mom of an incredibly, incredibly busy 1 year old who has flown before and struggled and did her best to not bother people, but probably failed and was deeply humiliated the whole time.
